  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Wirutn the past half-dozen years public school finance has 
become one of the most important subjects in the field of 
public education. With curriculum reconstruction, it now 
seems to be struggling for the position of first importance. 
This has come about in large part as a result of the changes 
in price levels and the decrease in purchasing power of 
money as a result of the World War. To a smaller degree, 
though, it has been because of a growing consciousness, on 
the part of students and administrators of education, of the 
fundamental importance of the financial problem. With 
our rapidly multiplying population, the expansion upward 
and outward of the instruction offered, the pronounced in- 
crease in attendance in the upper and more expensive levels, 
the many new demands being made on the schools, the ex- 
tension of and increase in the cost for all forms of govern- 
ment, the struggle with other city departments for funds, 
and the general breakdown of the old real and personal 
property taxes as means of governmental support, the 
question of educational costs was certain to become one of 
vital importance had no war come along to force the pro- 
blem, almost at once, into bold relief. 
With our entry into the World War all school building 
and all but the most necessary increase in school facilities 
stopped. Teachers’ salaries, though, and the cost for almost 
everything the schools had to buy doubled or more than 
doubled. Since the close of the War, in our effort to catch 
up in buildings and equipment, with the new duties in in- 
struction forced on the schools largely as an outcome of the 
War itself, and with the general demand for a decrease in

governmental expenses, the problem of how to continue to 
finance adequately our educational systems has become 
acute all over the United States. While something can be 
done locally, by following proper business procedures, there 
is good reason to believe that the present problem is so deep- 
seated that any real solution will require, in most of our 
States, a complete reorganization of taxing methods and a 
reshifting of the burdens of the maintenance of government. 
One of the most important steps looking toward the solu- 
tion of any problem is first to understand it clearly. With 
this in view, the problem of educational finance, or rather 
the group of problems, has recently received an unusual 
amount of attention from students of education every- 
where. State commissions and national organizations have 
studied it and offered solutions, and the problem has also 
been studied by taxing bodies and associations. From the 
educational point of view the most. important of the recent 
studies has been the work of the Educational Finance In- 
quiry Commission, which studied phases of the problem in 
selected States from 1921 to 1923. The results of this In- 
quiry Commission’s work have recently appeared, in thir- 
teen volumes. These present an abundance of facts and 
figures as to existing conditions, and contain the raw ma- 
terials out of which teachers of educational administration 
may construct courses in the subject. ‘These, and other 
publications, also contain the materials out of which in time 
will be built up scientific texts on the subject which will be 
of large value in instruction. 
In the meantime there is wide interest in the problem and 
a general demand for a good preliminary organization of the 
subject of public school finance, with a view to throwing as 
much light on the problem of financing education as can 
now be done. This the author of the present volume in 
this series of textbooks has been able to supply. After stat-

ing the problem and analyzing it into its parts, he has next 
treated it, in a series of chapters, from the point of view of 
the locality and the point of view of the State. He has tried 
to present both sides of questions, and has formulated def- 
inite conclusions only when these seemed warranted by 
present knowledge or present accepted practices. As a 
result he has offered us an interestingly written and a very 
usable presentation of the new field of public school finance, 
and one that it is believed will not only prove useful as a 
textbook with college classes in the study of the subject, but 
also very helpful to those charged with the administration 
of public education.

  AUTHOR’S PREFACE 
Tuere exists to-day a voluminous and rapidly growing 
literature on the subject of public school finance. This 
literature appears chiefly as articles in the professional edu- 
cational journals, as reports from educational and other or- 
ganizations, as bulletins issuing from colleges and univer- 
sities, from State educational departments, and from the 
United States Bureau of Education, and as fugitive pam- 
phlets from a variety of sources. It is widely scattered, 
and covers a multiplicity of topics. At the present moment 
there is nowhere to be found, within the compass of a single 
volume, a summary or outline of the problems presented 
and of the conclusions offered in this scattered literature. 
This volume is an attempt to supply such a summary or 
outline. It is the outgrowth of repeated attempts by its 
author to introduce his classes to the confusing mass of ma- 
terials available for study in this field. The book is in- 
tended primarily for students who are just entering upon the 
systematic study of public school finance, and for superin- 
tendents and other school officers who are actively engaged 
with the problems of financing public schools. At the same 
time the writer has tried to make his treatment sufficiently 
non-technical so that the book might interest and serve the 
more general reader. In accordance with its primary aim, 
though, emphasis has been given in the treatment to the 
problems most likely to present themselves in administering 
the finances of local schools. 
The writer has studiously striven to avoid drawing rigid 
conclusions and making doctrinaire statements. The sub- 
ject-matter of school finance is as yet in the making. Many
-P-A-G-E-10
  xii AUTHOR’S PREFACE 
of the most important problems are still in the stage of open 
controversy, with well-recognized authorities indorsing 
either side. The writer’s efforts have therefore been directed 
toward a succinct and organized summary which would re- 
flect the actual spirit and content of the best discussions 
in the field. Where this literature has shown substantial 
agreement about a matter, that matter has been handled 
here in the same one-sided way; but where controversial 
problems have been encountered, an earnest effort has been 
made to present the views of all sides fairly and completely. 
The book does not seek to offer a consistent philosophy of 
public school finance as evolved by its author, but rather to 
survey and describe the existing state of practice and opinion 
with reference to the numerous problems involved. 
The writer takes this opportunity to express his thanks 
to the many students and writers of whose work and writ- 
ings he has availed himself freely. It is impossible to make 
personal mention of them all in this place. A special ac- 
knowledgment, however, is due Professor E. T. Miller, of the 
Department of Economics, and Professor F, W. Graff, of 
the School of Business Administration, of the University of 
Texas, and to President Harlan Updegraff, of Cornell Col- 
lege, Mt. Vernon, Iowa, for reading and criticizing the 
chapters which are most closely related to their respective 
interests.

  AN INTRODUCTION TO 
PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
CHAPTER I 
THE SCHOOL FINANCE SITUATION 
Purpose of this chapter. One of the most noteworthy de- 
velopments in the educational world, in recent years, has 
been the appearance of a well-defined and scholarly interest 
in school finance. For this development several causes are 
responsible. It is realized by the reformers, perhaps more 
pointedly than ever before, that ““money makes the mare 
go,” in the schools, as elsewhere, and that to accomplish 
their dreams of expansion and improvement they must find 
the means to pay the bills. Again, the spirit of critical, 
scientific investigation which has been working its way for 
two decades or more into other departments of educational 
activity was bound at last to penetrate the field of finance. 
But possibly the most effective cause has been the growth 
of school and other public expenditures to the point where 
a reaction seems imminent, with the threat made every- 
where, and the reality appearing in many places, of a tearing- 
down, rather than a further building-up, of educational 
facilities. 
In other words, it is believed by many competent author- 
ities that the schools are face to face with a financial crisis. 
This belief has stimulated a very active study of the situa- 
tion. To some this situation seems prophetic of a period of 
decisive retrenchments, and possibly of a partial abandon-

ment of the American policy of free public education. To 
others, however, it is only a challenge to the schools to im- 
prove their management and to work out a more efficient 
system of support. The purpose of this chapter is to set 
forth the evidence on both sides of the question, with a view 
to showing the importance of the improved financial prac- 
tices described in the subsequent chapters. 
Supremacy of the public school. To-day, in the United 
States, the public school is the prevailing type. In 1920 
there were approximately twenty million children in ele- 
mentary schools and two and a quarter millions in high 
schools of this character, as against one and a half million 
elementary-school children and a quarter of a million sec- 
ondary-school pupils in non-public schools. In the domain 
of higher education, publicly supported institutions served 
a body of three hundred and thirty thousand students, as 
compared with less than three hundred thousand in non- 
public higher institutions.!_ And even here “the enrollment 
in private institutions has increased 118 per cent in twenty 
years, while that in public institutions has increased 309 per 
cent.” ? 
Public schools are tax-supported. To appreciate the 
urgency of some of the problems set forth in this and later 
chapters, it is necessary to realize that the public schools of 
the United States are supported mainly through taxation. 
It is officially stated that of the total expenditure for educa- 
tion in 1918, “only 2.9 per cent comes from permanent 
funds, and only 4.6 per cent from incidental sources. In 
short, 92.5 per cent of our school revenue is raised annually 
by taxation.” In 1919-20 the corresponding figures were: 
From permanent funds, 2.7 per cent; from incidental

sources, 5.2 per cent; from taxation (including appropria- 
tions), 92.1 per cent.! 
Enormous cost of education. Not only has public educa- 
tion become an extensive business, but it has also become 
an extremely costly enterprise. In_1920 the value of all 
public school property in the United States approximated 
two and a half billions of dollars. The total school indebted- 
ness was over six hundred and fifty millions. The cost of 
maintaining the public schools for that year was more than a 
billion dollars — more than six million dollars a day to run 
the schools of the United States.? While perhaps not im- 
posing when compared with the billions which were recently 
poured out so freely in the prosecution of the World War, 
nevertheless, when compared with old-time standards of 
educational expenditure, these sums are enormous. 
Growth of public school expenditures. Tracing the re- 
cord of school expenditures in the United States in normal 
times before the War, one discovers an almost unbroken line 
of annual increases. Figures are available for the period 
from 1870 to 1920. Only during the years from 1875 to 
1879 is a decline in the annual amounts of school expenditure 
recorded. In every other year the amount spent for public 
education was greater than any previous expenditure. 
The average increase has been more than five per cent per 
annum, even when the five years of regressive expenditures 
are included. ‘This increase in school costs is also roughly 
progressive. Since 1905 it has amounted to nearly ten per 
cent per annum. At this latter rate, every decade would 
witness a doubling of the total expenditure for schools.’ 
This increase in costs may be expressed in relation, first,

Abstract of the United States for 1918.

to the increase in total population, and, second, to the in- 
crease in pupil enrollment in the schools. 
In 1870, the annual cost of education for each person in the 
population was less than $2. The average has steadily increased 
since that time until in 1918 the average cost is a little over $7. 
The rate of increase has been comparatively rapid since 1900... . 
The annual cost has increased from $15 per pupil in 1885 to over 
$49 in 1918. Since 1900 the increase has been very pronounced. 
In fact, the annual cost has more than doubled in these 18 years. 
...Since the latter date the cost has increased from 14 cents to 
almost 31 cents per day. 
Another writer ? summarizes the tendencies here described 
by saying that 
the children attending public schools have, for half a century, been 
increasing more rapidly than the population, that the expense has 
been increasing far more rapidly than the children, and that the 
rate of expenditure is itself increasing in a constantly accelerating 
manner 
This growth of expenditures may be attributed to many 
things. At this point we may neglect the influence of the 
War, which will be taken up in the next section. During 
the period that has been described, the main causes were 
perhaps the increased length of term and the multiplication 
and enforcement of compulsory attendance laws. Since 
1900 reforms in the curriculum, building standards, and the 
requirements made upon teachers have been instrumental 
factors. 
The schools seem possessed of an inveterate propensity 
to expand and intensify their activities. In recent years no 
other field of public service has witnessed more agitation or 
actual development. These tendencies in the schools are as 
evident now as ever, and almost every proposal involves

THE SCHOOL FINANCE SITUATION 7 
increased expenditures. The following objectives of con- 
temporary school reformers may be mentioned as examples: 
Modernized school buildings, sufficient to accommodate the 
country’s children. 
Adequate equipment for these buildings. 
Sufficient, properly equipped playground space. 
Smaller classes and more and better teachers. 
Professionalized supervision in both urban and rural schools. 
Universal mental and physical examinations, followed by proper 
treatment and care. 
Enrichment of the curriculum by the addition of new and ex- 
pensive subjects. 
These are only a few of many proposals for reform and 
expansion now being made by the friends of the schools. 
Yet to achieve these alone would mean an enormous increase 
in the present burden of expenditures. And that educators 
do not believe that the growth of expenditures has reached 
its limit is shown in the suggestion by Commissioner Claxton, 
in 1921, that the spending of two and a half billion dollars 
annually for education in the United States would not be 
unreasonable. The Commissioner writes:! 
To pay 750,000 teachers an annual wage of $2000 would take 
appropriations of a billion and a half of dollars. Add another 
billion — a generous estimate — for expenses aside from teachers’ 
salaries, and we reach a total of $2,500,000,000 to be spent for 
education. 
Effects of the War. A new factor in the mounting costs 
of education was introduced by the World War. While the 
older factors of expansion and intensification largely ceased 
to operate for a time after 1918, this new factor more than 
compensated for their absence. It has been estimated that’ 
the cost of providing the same amount and quality of school 
service increased from 1915 to 1920 by more than one hun- 
1 Claxton, P. P.: Independent, January 22, 1921, p. 85.
-P-A-G-E-22
  8 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
dred per cent. Salaries and other maintenance charges 
doubled, and the cost of outlays tripled, during that period. 
If during this time, therefore, an actual doubling of school 
expenditures did not result, it was because fewer or inferior 
services were rendered by the schools! 4 
The natural inquiry at this point is: To what extent are 
post-War prices likely to be permanent? That some decline 
may be expected has already become clear, especially in the 
salaries of teachers. But will the cost of a given type and 
quality of educational service ever again drop to pre-War 
standards? 
Burgess argues that the new cost levels will probably be 
maintained for a long time to come. He shows first that 
salaries, wages, and building-operations consume four fifths 
of the schools’ regular expenditures. He believes that “the 
pay of teachers and other school officers will tend to settle 
within the next year or two at a level one hundred per cent 
higher than in 1915.” As bases for this inference he adduces 
wage and salary increases in other occupations, and the 
history of wages and salaries following the Civil War. 
Once these new salary levels have been attained, he ap- 
prehends no great recession from them. “It may be said 
with substantial truth that wages and salaries retain ad- 
vances once made.” 
This writer also anticipates no great decline in building 
costs. These costs are dependent upon the prices of labor 
and materials; and the cost of materials, in turn, is largely 
dependent upon wages. His confidence in the durability of 
the new wage scales, therefore, leads him to expect no 
marked decline in the cost of new construction. Moreover, 
the schools are “‘underequipped with buildings. The con- 
struction of the next few years must be sufficient to make up 
for this deficit as well as to provide for new increases in the 
1 Burgess, W. R.: op cit., pp. 107-15.

  THE SCHOOL FINANCE SITUATION 9 
school population and the replacement of old buildings now 
unfit for use.” ! 
Salaries, wages, and construction costs account for about 
eighty per cent of regular school expenditures. - Of the re- 
mainder, a considerable share goes for free textbooks and 
supplies. Here again data are available to show a cost 
increase of about one hundred per cent, resulting from 
increases in wages and the price of raw materials.? If 
Burgess’s assumption regarding the persistence of wage 
standards is correct, an early decline to pre-War standards 
in the costs of these tools of education can hardly be ex- 
pected. 
Growth of general public expenditures. This book is 
engaged with certain aspects of the subject of public school 
finance, and not with the subject of public finance in general. 
But it must be constantly recognized that the former is a 
part of the latter, and that school financial problems must 
frequently be projected against the background of general 
public finance. In particular at this point, the full signifi- 
cance of the growth of school expenditures can be appreci- 
ated only when viewed in connection with the growth of 
public expenditures along all lines. 
One accepted authority? has stated that “national ex- 
penditures payable from taxes have increased in one hundred 
and eleven years something over five times as fast as the 
population,” and that from 1880 to 1902 State and local 
expenditures increased from $6.26 to $9.22 per capita, or 
47.3 per cent. Another authority,‘ also speaking of the 
United States, says that “public expenditures have grown

very rapidly, especially since 1850.” Both of the foregoing 
statements have reference to the period preceding 1900. 
For the first decade of the twentieth century we have the 
following statement: 4 
In a paper read at the meeting of the National Tax Association 
in San Francisco last August (1915), the chief statistician of the 
Federal Census Bureau showed that according to the statistics 
collected by that department the expenditures of the Federal 
Government had increased 54.5 per cent from 1903 to 1913, and 
that during the same period the average increase in the expendi- 
tures for the several States and their subdivisions was 105.9 per 
cent for the States, 95.2 per cent for the counties, 103.2 per cent for 
the cities of more than 8000 population, and 100 per cent for all 
other political subdivisions. Excluding the Federal Government 
the figures show an average increase of 101.5 per cent in the cost of 
government for all the States, counties, and municipalities in the 
country. 
The effect of the War upon the growth of general public 
expenditures is shown by a recent estimate that the total of 
local, State, and national expenditures had increased from a 
little over two billion dollars in 1912-18 to nearly eight and a 
half billions in 1920-21. This is an increase of about four 
hundred per cent in a decade, and of course greatly exceeds 
the population increase of the period. 
Why public expenditures increase. Many causes are 
responsible for the constantly increasing demands made in 
normal times by public services upon the public purse. 
Military and related disbursements account for the bulk 
of the increased cost of the National Government. The 
growth of cities in size and numbers is doubtless one cause 
of the growth of local expenditures. But the fundamental 
causes would seem to be the expansion and intensification

of the functions of all governmental units — local, State, 
and national. Here we encounter what is known as “‘ Wag- 
ner’s Law.” 4 
Comprehensive comparisons of different countries and different 
times show that, among progressive peoples, with which alone we 
are concerned, an increase regularly takes place in the activity of 
both the central and the local governments. This increase is both 
extensive and intensive; the central and local governments con- 
stantly undertake new functions, while they perform both old and 
new functions more effectively and completely. In this way the 
economic needs of the people, to an increasing extent and in a 
more satisfactory fashion, are satisfied by the central and local 
governments. ‘The clear proof of this is found in the statistics 
which show the increased needs of central governments and local 
political units. 
The accompaniment of this increase of governmental 
functions has been the addition, on national, State, and 
local levels, of new and costly departments and divisions. 
In our National Government have appeared in recent years 
the Departments of Agriculture and Commerce and Labor; 
while our postal services have been extended, codperative 
highway construction has been undertaken, and movements 
inaugurated looking to the conservation of our human and 
natural resources. These are but examples. In the States 
the last generation has seen the multiplication of State officials and 
the erection of social controls on the part of State Governments 
that the generation preceding knew nothing about.... The new 
labors undertaken by the State Governments for the people in the 
way of better health conditions, financial protection, better labor 
conditions, the improvement of highways, a better administration 
of the agencies for charities and corrections and superior forms of 
education, in themselves constitute an evolution that amounts to 
revolution.?

12 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
  Locally, the growth of cities, together with the increasing 
complexity and costliness of municipal. government, ac- 
counts in the main for the increased expenditures. 
Relation to growth of wealth. The mere fact that public 
expenditures have increased, even at a rate disproportionate 
to the growth of population, is not, after all, very meaning- 
ful. The important question is: Has the growth of public 
expenditures exceeded the growth of public wealth? It is 
wealth, rather than numbers, which determines the ability 
of a people to bear a heavy burden of taxation. 
For the pre-War period a conflict seems to exist between 
authorities on this important subject. Thus, Chairman 
Tawney, quoted above, says that “State and local taxation 
is increasing proportionately with national wealth and the 
ability of the people to meet the added costs of local gov- 
ernment, while national expenditures — though growing 
rapidly — do not keep pace with the increasing national 
wealth”; and the National Industrial Conference Board, 
also quoted in an earlier paragraph, finds that “the ex- 
penditures of the National Government showed a sixteen- 
fold rise in the period between 1850 and 1912, but national 
wealth grew to twenty-seven times its earlier proportions 
during the same interval.” Plehn, on the other hand, after 
remarking that “the increase in public expenditures is more 
rapid than the increase in population,” adds that “it is 
probably more rapid, also, than increase in wealth and 
in private incomes.” Also, the statement of Chairman 
Tawney has been adversely criticized, as follows:! 
Mr. Tawney averred that Federal expenditure, in comparison 
with national wealth, has maintained an almost uniform propor- 
tion, except during the period of the Civil War. But on referring 
to the Census Bureau analysis it appears that in 1860 the Federal 
expenditures per $1000 of national wealth was $4.40, while in 1907   
"1 Ford, H. J.: The Cost of Our National Government, p. 8. Gorenine 
University Press, 1910.
-P-A-G-E-27
THE SCHOOL FINANCE SITUATION 13 
  it was $6.70. The statistics given in regard to expenditure by 
State and local authority are scantier than in the case of the Na- 
tional Government, but it appears that the expenditures of States, 
counties, cities, and minor civil divisions amounted to $9.30 per 
$1000 of national wealth in 1890, and that the rate had increased to 
$12.80 in 1902....It appears that... the cost of local govern- 
ment is increasing in even greater ratio than that of Federal gov- 
ernment, and that in both fields the increase is in greater propor- 
tion than the increase of national wealth. 
In view of these contradictory statements by recognized 
authorities, it seems wise for the non-specialist in public 
finance to withhold judgment as to the relation between the 
growth of public expenditures and the growth of public 
wealth in normal times. The tendencies of the past decade, 
however, seem plain. Since 1914, due to the War and as- 
sociated causes, expenditures have increased as never before 
in our national history, and out of all proportion to the in- 
crease, if there has been any increase, in our national 
wealth. On this point the Research Report of the National 
Industrial Conference Board says (no. 13, p. 74): 
Whereas taxes related to national income constituted but 6.7 
per cent in the calendar year 1902, and 6.4 per cent in the cal- 
endar year 1913, the percentage had increased to 12.1 per cent in 
the calendar year 1919, and in the calendar year 1921, on the 
basis of a rough estimate of that year’s increases, the tax burden 
of all authorities in this country represented 16.7 per cent of the 
nation’s income. 
Reaction against high taxes. Restiveness under the 
burden of taxes is not a new thing, in the United States 
or elsewhere. It was evident long before the War. Thus, 
Mr. E. T. Lyons, addressing the Wisconsin State Commis- 
sion, in 1916, said:! 
One of the most significant features of civil government in recent 
years has been the rapid increase in public expenditures. As these 
1 Quoted by Bullock, C. J., op. cit. (1920 edition), p. 51.  
-P-A-G-E-28
    14 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
expenditures are primarily met by taxation, the movement has re- 
sulted in a widespread complaint against high taxes.... From the 
violence and persistence of this agitation in public and private 
speech and in our local press, it might naturally be inferred that 
the condition was confined to Wisconsin, but such is far from the 
case. Like protest has been heard in nearly every part of the 
country and particularly in the States north of Mason and Dixon’s 
line. 
So common has been this complaining, and so long con- 
tinued, that a certain amount of “groaning under taxation” 
has come to be expected, and it is not easy to tell when this 
innocuous complaining has given place to determined op- 
position. But the time of positive reaction is thought by 
many to be close upon us, if it has not actually arrived. 
The political press is filled with protests against “confisca- 
tory taxes.” The revision of the tax system has become the 
outstanding problem confronting governments, especially 
in the States. The seriousness of the situation has been put 
in these words, by a popular review:! 
It may astonish some to know that each one of us who works 
with hand or brain for wages, salary, or other compensation is, on 
the average, contributing one day’s work a week to the expense of 
governing the Nation. In other words, something like one seventh 
of the annual earnings of the people of the United States are paid 
back to the Nation or some other political entity in the form of 
taxes. 
Instances of present-day protests are so numerous that it 
is difficult to choose among them. However, the following 
statement by the National Industrial Conference Board ? is 
so conservative and yet so emphatic, and represents the view

  of such powerful business interests, that it well deserves a 
place in this chapter: 
In... pre-War days it was a fairly common expression of opin- 
ion that taxation was rapidly approaching a point which threatened 
to court popular disfavor and breed general discontent with gov- 
ernment. 
If this is true of the period prior to 1914, how much more true is 
it to-day when the War, with its enormous destruction of capital, 
with its impoverishment of the whole human race and its weaken- 
ing of its moral stamina, has left as a heritage for the next genera- 
tion debts which bid fair to establish, for a generation or two at 
least, an annual carrying charge beside which pre-War figures pale. 
In the last analysis all taxes— whether direct or indirect, 
whether borne by those who pay first or later shifted to the shoul- 
ders of others — must come out of the excess of income over con- 
sumption, or out of the national surplus of either past or current 
origin. Since the latter has appreciably diminished as a result of 
the War and since national productiveness has been impaired... 
the seriousness of the situation is multiplied many fold in view of 
the piling up of tax burdens.... Under present conditions, the 
tax bill in the United States is fast making inroads on the surplus 
necessary for economic progress and threatens materially to ham- 
per our growth. 
A crisis in school finance? ‘To this point we have ob- 
served the following facts: More than ninety per cent of the 
students attending elementary, secondary, and higher edu- 
cational institutions in this country are cared for in publicly 
supported institutions. More than nine tenths of the sup- 
port of these public institutions is raised annually through 
taxation. Since 1870 school costs have grown at a rate 
greatly exceeding the growth of population and school at- 
tendance, and “in a constantly accelerating manner.” 
To-day, the annual cost of public education exceeds one 
billion dollars; while the expenditure of two and a half 
billions annually has been proposed by a former National 
Commissioner of Education. Alongside of this increase in  
-P-A-G-E-30
    16 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
educational expenditures has gone an increase in public 
expenditures of all kinds, until the restiveness of the public 
under the growing burden of taxation seems to many writers 
to be approaching the point of definite and determined op- 
position. 
The full significance of this situation for the schools will be 
better understood when it is noted that, on a conservative 
estimate, approximately one third of the combined ex- 
penditures of communities, cities, and States goes for edu- 
cation. Expenditures for schools constitute the largest 
single item in the public budget, below the national level. 
Says Alexander:! 
Education receives roughly two per cent of Federal net ex- 
penditures, thirty-four per cent of State expenditures, and at 
least thirty-two per cent of municipal expenditures in cities of 
over 30,000 population, and a much higher percentage in the 
smaller towns and rural areas. 
In view of these facts, one feels no great astonishment at 
the statement of former Commissioner Claxton that “we 
have come to a crisis in education in the United States”; 
or at the remark of another writer that “there are signs, and 
not a few, that the cost of education is reaching the break- 
ing point”; * or at the statement that “under the enormous 
load of taxation that society carries to-day, communities will 
arise against the burdensome cost of public education.” # 
One even considers seriously the suggestion from still an- 
other source ¢ that the American people may be forced to 
reconsider, and substantially to revise, their present pro- 
gram of free secondary and higher education. Still an-

other authority! has summarized the situation in some 
detail as follows: 
From numerous rural areas come reports of salary cuts, abandon- 
ment of consolidation, rebellion against transportation costs, and 
postponement of absolutely necessary new buildings. Shortening 
of terms is fairly common.... Many city school systems are far 
behind with their building programs, with the result that numbers 
of children are on part-time, or housed in school buildings ruinous 
to health, morals, and any attempt at good work.... Everywhere 
is an insistent demand for the elimination of costly “frills” from 
modern school systems. Many cities are bonded to the last possi- 
ble debt limit for school purposes; and an alarming number of 
them by various subterfuges are bonding for current expenses. In 
one city, noted throughout the land for its pride in the deserved 
reputation of its public schools, the civic leaders have plainly said 
that the school taxes cannot be increased because the total tax 
burden is already sufficient to discourage industries from locating 
in the city.... In most States the public higher institutions are 
preparing for financial difficulties. 
Emphasis is given to the foregoing statements by news 
items appearing in the current educational periodicals. 
The following are illustrative of a larger number which have 
been culled by the writer from the news columns of a single 
educational journal,? in the six issues from January to June, 
1922: 
The W. , West Virginia, school board opened schools a week 
later in September and effected a saving by paying the teachers 
three weeks’ salaries. The teachers have entered a protest against 
this method of achieving economy. 
ie » Pennsylvania: A statement of the school board finances 
shows estimated expenses for 1922 of $13,374,000, which means 
that a deficit of $3,000,000 must be met by a bond issue.

remedy. 
The I—,, Indiana, school board will engage in a temporary 
loan of $1,000,000 in order to tide over until the spring tax funds 
are available. 
The school board at H- » Kentucky, is wrestling with a $17,-

funds, the solution must be found in cutting the salaries of teachers 
or closing the schools. 
In view of the shortage of funds hundreds of school districts in 
Montana have no recourse other than to close with short terms. 
C—, Illinois. The bureau of Public Efficiency has addressed 
the members of the school board pleading for a reduction of the 
present school levy.... The bureau points out that the tax bills 
are much higher than ever before, and that the largest single item 
of increase is that for school purposes. 
B——, Idaho. The board has made changes in the direction of 
economy.... It has decided to discontinue the courses in manual 
training, domestic science, music, and penmanship, and to increase 
the number of students in high-school classes so that two or three 
teachers may be eliminated. 
B , Michigan. By a vote of four to one, the school district 
has rejected a proposal to issue $1,000,000 in bonds for new build- 
ings. The board declares that the schools are seven years behind 
in building needs.   
  
W—, Washington. How school expenses can be reduced is the 
problem at present facing the school officials. There has never 
been in the history of the schools such a demand as there is at the 
present time for strict economy and the reduction of taxes. 
B , Washington. An annual saving of $35,000 to the schools 
has been made possible by the board through the elimination of the 
bonuses formerly paid to teachers.

garten and manual training departments and has made a reduction

ten special courses. The courses selected for elimination are 
swimming instruction, orchestra work, bank work, adult educa- 
tion, short commercial courses, graduating exercises in the primary 
grades, drawing, sewing, cooking, gardening, manual training, and 
music. The teachers have accepted reductions in salaries in spite 
of the fact that they are handling from fifteen to twenty-five per 
cent more than the normal amount of work. 
N-. » Idaho. Salary reductions, elimination of departments, 
and consolidation of positions have been ordered by the board to 
effect a saving of $20,000 for the next year.   
The news items having to do with “deficits and retrench- 
ments,” of which the foregoing are examples, make up over 
thirty-one per cent of the financial items in this one journal 
during the period indicated. Only eight per cent of the 
financial items are concerned with “increases in mainte- 
nance.” In 1915 thirty-three per cent of the financial items 
in this journal were concerned with increases in maintenance, 
and less than twenty-seven per cent with deficits and re- 
trenchments. The full significance of the growth of deficits 
and retrenchments is not shown, however, by. this small per- 
centage difference. More significant is the change in the 
nature of the items. In 1915 the items were small and un- 
important as compared with the rather startling conditions 
suggested by the reports for 1922. 
A different interpretation. The view of the school finance 
situation which has been set forth up to this point is, by 
both implication and direct statement, a gloomy one. But 
there also appears in the literature a very different view of 
the case. According to this other interpretation-the crisis 
now confronting the schools is psychological rather than eco- 
nomic. The public, according to this view, is abundantly able 
to finance its present school program, as well as to provide 
for all essential additions thereto. If any sort of limit 
has been reached by the schools, it is not the limit of the  
-P-A-G-E-34
  20 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
public’s economic ability, but rather the limit of its present 
willingness to extend its support of education. That even 
this limit has been attained is doubted. The present situa- 
tion is interpreted as a challenge to the school to practice 
economy and achieve efficiency in the use of its present 
funds, and to convince the public that it has done so. Itisa 
challenge to the cultivation of greater public confidence and 
appreciation, but, according to this view, there is no present 
threat of enforced retrenchments on any large scale. The 
arguments for this interpretation are presented in the sec- 
tions which follow. 
School expenditures versus national wealth. One argu- 
ment is that, considering our national income and wealth, and 
the paramount importance of public education, the amount 
now spent upon our schools is very small. Let us permit 
the advocates of this argument to speak for themselves.! 
There is no basis in fact to justify alarm over the cost of public 
schools. The Nation is able to afford its present educational ex- 
penditures as well as additional expenditures when they become 
necessary . . . consider the following figures: 
Cost of public schools, 1921 
Estimated national wealth, 1921... 
Annual national income (average for 1920 and 
1921)... 
Savings deposits, $1,192,000,000 
232,977,598,000 
    - 63,000,000,000 
- 16,618,595,000    
All public expenditures for the country as a whole could be pro- 
vided for by a five-mill tax on our national wealth; these expendi- 
tures are less than two per cent of the national income and only 
slightly over seven per cent of the amount in the Nation’s savings 
banks. 
Strayer presents the same argument in another way 
when he writes: 
We spent in 1920, as a people, approximately one and a half per   
1 Journal of the National Education Association, March, 1923, p. 118.
-P-A-G-E-35
  
THE SCHOOL FINANCE SITUATION 21 
cent of our income for education. In thirty-one out of forty-eight 
States, less than two per cent of the income of the people of the 
several States was devoted to public education. In seventeen 
States, more than two per cent of the income of the people was 
spent for this purpose. It is interesting to note that in the very 
wealthy and thickly populated States the per cent of the income 
spent for education is relatively low. For example, in New York, 
it was 1.18 per cent, in Massachusetts 1.22 per cent, in Illinois 1.36 
per cent, in Ohio 1.65 per cent, and in California 1.84 per cent. 
The larger percentages of the income of the people devoted to pub- 
lic education were found in the sparsely settled parts of the country, 
particularly in the Northwest. The percentage of the income of 
the people devoted to public education was 4.41 per cent in Mon- 
tana, 4.02 per cent in North Dakota, 3.76 per cent in Utah, 3.43 
per cent in Idaho, and 3.13 per cent in Arizona. There were no 
other States in which the percentage of the income of the people 
devoted to public education exceeded three per cent.1 
Still another form of this argument appears in this 
statement from Engleman: 
What of the charge that the State cannot afford the cost of edu- 
cating its children? The answer is that education at almost any 
price is actually cheaper than ignorance, immorality, and crime. 
Our government is predicated upon the assumption that knowledge 
and virtue shall be generally diffused among our people. Under 
no other condition is our form of government workable.... In- 
creased education results in increased values of property in any 
community. Indeed, property, and life itself, is made safe and 
secure only as schools abound and do the work for which they were 
established.? 
Education versus luxuries. A second argument to show 
that the American public can well afford to support educa- 
tion is based upon a comparison of our national expenditures 
1 Strayer, G. D.: American School Board Journal, August, 1923, pp. 
54-55.

-P-A-G-E-36
  22 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
for schools and for luxuries. The following quotation ! 
gives a basis for contrasting these relative expenditures: 
Statisticians for the Government have labored hard to bring the 
relative figures as to military expenditures and the amounts spent 
by the people of the country for amusements and minor luxuries 
out so sharply that their significance would be seen at a glance. 
One set of tables shows that against $418,000,000 spent for the 
army in 1921, the country spent $750,000,000 in candy and chew- 
ing gum, $834,000,000 in soda and confections, and $959,000,000 
for perfumery, jewelry, silk stockings, and other articles for per- 
sonal adornment. The smokers poured out $1,151,000,000 for 
tobacco in all forms. Baseball fans, theater-goers, cabaret fre- 
quenters, and those attending concerts, paid $897,000,000. The 
total of the above sums is $4,591,000,000. 
Approximately four dollars, then, are spent annually for 
luxuries of the kinds included in this statement for every 
dollar that is spent for public education. Upon such a 
showing, ask those who defend the cost of public schools, 
Can the people conscientiously object to their present burden 
of educational expenditures? Is there much ground for 
opposition so long as the school bill and the tobacco bill of 
the United States remain about the same? 
Alongside this statement of immoderate expenditures for 
luxuries should be placed the next statement,? indicating a 
really frugal support of education: 
Take the figure of $80 as representative of the cost per pupil in 
our city schools. Is this an unreasonable amount? Consider 
what it buys. In most cities it purchases 190 days of instruction of 
five hours or more, under a trained teacher, in a sanitary building. 
Tt often includes an hour or more of supervised physical training on 
a well-equipped playground. ‘The cost is 42 cents per day. How 
does this compare with the cost of five hours’ entertainment in the 
ordinary movie? How many children are spending this amount

THE SCHOOL FINANCE SITUATION 23 
for unnecessary purchases that they would be better without? 
How many “heads of families” spend this much each day, with 
hardly a thought, for cigars for themselves and their friends? 
Surely a majority of the voters will not deny 42 cents or even more for so 
important a purpose as the schooling of a child! 
Fictitious rise of school costs. The third aspect of the 
defense of current school expenditures is, in fact, an attack 
upon the theory presented in earlier paragraphs that school 
costs have increased. The general contention here is that 
the rise in school costs has been only apparent; that, in fact, 
when compared with other expenditure standards, it costs 
less to-day to provide a given amount and quality of educa- 
tional service than it did twenty or thirty years ago. This 
point has been forcibly expressed by the financial research 
committee of the National Education Association, in the 
following statement :+ 
The cost of education in the United States has been increasing 
since our system of public education began. This fact has re- 
ceived much attention from those who are interested in maintain- 
ing a low tax standard.... Good educational statesmanship de- 
mands a careful interpretation of such statements before it allows 
conclusions to be drawn from them. 
No business man worthy of the name would ask for a statement 
of the total yearly expenditures of his concern and with this table 
alone before him decide as to the effectiveness of his plant. Even 
those unacquainted with the details of business management know 
that to interpret this table he would demand accompanying state- 
ments which would show such facts as (1) changes in the cost of 
labor and of the raw materials used in the product of the concern, 
(2) changes in the quantity of the output, and (3) changes in the 
quality of the output. We must know these same things concern- 
ing education before we can properly interpret figures representing 
its cost.

[Regarding the first point.] To. have the purchasing power that 
$100 represented in 1890, one needed $99 in 1900, $132 in 1910, ‘and 
$290 in 1920.... A dollar in 1900 would purchase 101 per cent as 
much as in 1890, 76 per cent as much in 1910 as in 1890, and 34 per 
cent as much in 1920 as in 1890. Since the dollar of 1920 will pur- 
chase but 34 per cent as much as the dollar of 1890, the $1,045,000,- 
000 spent for education in 1920 has on the 1890 basis a purchasing 
power of but $355,000,000. 
[As to changes in quantity of output.] 1,098,000,000 days of 
schooling were provided by public schools in 1890 as compared 
with 2,620,000,000 days in 1920.... If the number of days’ 
schooling provided in 1890 is represented by the figure 100, the 
number of days in 1900 is represented by 140; in 1910, by 183; and 
in 1920, by 239. These figures show clearly how important it is, 
when considering the cost of education, to take into consideration 
the increased educational output. 
[As to quality of output.] It is impossible to tell exactly how 
one day’s schooling in the “‘average”’ schoolroom in 1890 compared 
with one day’s schooling in the “average” schoolroom of the coun- 
try in 1900, 1910, and 1920. We do know that between 1890 and 
1920 education was first strongly influenced by the scientific move- 
ment. As a result of this movement in education the objectives 
and the methods of instruction have been scrutinized as never be- 
fore. That there has been some improvement may be stated with- 
out fear of successful contradiction. 
[In conclusion.] The cost of education in 1920 was $149,233,- 
646.23 as compared with $140,506,715 in 1890, after proper allow- 
ances have been made for the decrease in the purchasing power of 
the dollar and for the quantitative increase in the educational out- 
put. The difference between these two figures, or $8,726,931.23, 
can be charged against the improvement in the quality of the edu- 
cational output. Over a period of thirty years there has been a six 
per cent increase in the amount of money allowed for education, or 
less than two tenths of one per cent per year.... Rather than an 
enormous increase in educational support, practically nothing has 
been allowed public education in the country with the improve- 
ment of the quality of the product in mind. Practically all the 
increase has been swallowed up by the decreasing purchasing power 
of the dollar and the increase in the number of children who are 
attending our schools.

  THE SCHOOL FINANCE SITUATION 25 
Chapter summary — The challenge to the schools. This 
chapter has shown, first, that public education greatly pre- 
ponderates over non-public education, upon all levels, in the 
United States; also that more than nine tenths of the support 
of public education is raised annually through taxation. 
Expenditures for public education, it has also been shown, 
have increased from about sixty million dollars in 1870 to 
over one billion dollars in 1920. This growth in school ex- 
penditures is only part of a general growth of public ex- 
penditures along all lines; a growth exceeding in rate that of 
population and possibly also that of wealth. A situation 
has resulted which, in the view of many people, brings the 
schools as well as other public services face to face with a 
financial crisis. 
This situation is susceptible of two interpretations. One 
is that the present tax burden is really excessive, at least 
upon those who bear it. From this viewpoint, economy and 
possible retrenchment comprise the future lot of the schools. 
The policy of providing free secondary and higher edication 
at public expense may have to be revised or abandoned, or a 
rigorous selection may have to be made of those to whom 
these advanced educational privileges should be extended. 
On the other hand, however, it is contended that the 
American public, even under present conditions, is well able 
to provide for its schools. In support of this view it is urged 
that the schools really consume less than two per cent of the 
national income, and less than a quarter of what is spent 
upon dispensable luxuries. It is also held that the growth 
of school expenditures, upon which the champions of re- 
trenchment lay such great stress, is more apparent than real; 
practically the whole of the increase since 1890 being charge- 
able to increased school attendance and a decline in the pur- 
chasing power of money. The problem before the schools, 
from this viewpoint, is psychological rather than economie, 
 
-P-A-G-E-40

and consists in bringing home to the people the full impor- 
tance and value of education. 
These conflicting interpretations hold a certain amount 
of theoretic interest. Practically, however, it would seem to 
make little difference which should be the true one, for the 
relief measures proposed by both parties to the controversy 
are about the same. Such differences as exist are in em- 
phasis rather than in specific policies. Both advise the 
practice of greater economy and more efficient business 
management in school financial transactions. Both also 
urge the need for cultivating in the public mind greater con- 
fidence in and appreciation for the schools. Under either 
theory, the following objectives are set up for achievement 
by the conscientious school administrator: 
1. To create in the public mind a sense of fairness, with respect 
to the distribution of both the burden and the benefits of 
public education. 
2. To create in the public mind a feeling of confidence in the in- 
tegrity, financial acumen, and business ability of those who 
administer the funds for schools. 
8. To create in the public mind a better understanding and more 
sympathetic appreciation of what the schools are trying to ac- 
complish, so that the public will rate education, even in eco- 
nomic values, above unessential luxuries. 
The problem presented is an economic one to the extent 
that it involves a study of the whole range of public taxation 
and finance. It is a psychological problem to the extent that it 
involves a change in the public attitude toward educators 
and education. But if both of these aspects of the problem 
can be handled successfully, there would seem to be no cause 
for serious apprehension on the part of friends of education, 
and no reason now for receding from the position set for 
school-men twenty years ago, in the following words:! 
The masses of people must be taught to use their reason, to seek

the truth, and to love justice and mercy. There is no safety for 
democratic society in truth held, or justice loved, by the few; the 
millions must mean to do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly 
with their God. The millions must be taught to discuss, not fight; 
to trust publicity, not secrecy; and to take timely public precau- 
tions against every kind of selfish oppression. To give this in- 
struction steadily and universally society possesses no organized 
agency which compares in present efficiency and future promise 
with the schools. ‘Therefore, the present expenditure on schools is 
fully justified and increased expenditure urgently demanded. 
TOPICS FOR INVESTIGATION AND DISCUSSION 
1. Search the tables of contents of various available educational journals, 
for issues since June, 1923, for articles, discussions, and news items 
which will help to bring down to date this description of the school 
financial situation. 
2. Compare per capita expenditures for education, and the proportion 
of public expenditures devoted to education, in your own State and 
community with those elsewhere. 
8. Are there evidences in your community or State of serious public 
reaction against what is considered burdensome taxation? If so, what? 
4. What action, if any, is being taken by the schools of your community 
or State to relieve the situation? 
. How do you reconcile the following statements, appearing in different 
places in the text of this chapter? 
(1) “Something like one seventh of the annual earnings of the peo- 
ple of the United States are paid back to the Nation or some 
other political entity in the form of taxes.” 
(2) “Expenditures for schools comprise about one third of all pub- 
lic expenditures made by States and lesser political units.’’ 
(8) “In thirty-one out of forty-eight States, less than two per cent 
of the income of the people of the several States was devoted to 
public education.” 
6. What is your own interpretation, based upon your own observation 
and experience, of the present school financial situation? on

  CHAPTER II 
THE PROBLEMS OF SCHOOL FINANCE 
Purpose of this chapter. In the chapter just concluded the 
public schools were discovered to be involved in a perplexing 
financial situation. In subsequent chapters several ways 
and means for extricating them from these embarrassments 
will be considered. It is first necessary, though, to analyze 
the situation that has been described into its more outstand- 
ing problems, which problems will form the central themes 
around which the discussion in later chapters will revolve. 
The purpose of this chapter, then, is to introduce the sub- 
stance of the chapters to follow, in such a way as to connect 
them as clearly as possible with the discussion that has pre- 
ceded. 
The three major problems. The one great problem of 
public school finance is that of securing willing and adequate 
support for the schools. This problem is present, either in 
the foreground or the background, in nearly every book and 
article that has been written on any phase of this subject, 
but a comprehensive analysis of the now voluminous litera- 
ture shows this problem to be breaking up into three sub- 
problems which can be rather definitely distinguished. 
These sub-problems may now properly be regarded as the 
three major problems of public school finance. They are as 
follows: 
1. The local problem; — that of applying the methods 
of modern business management to the administration of 
school finance. Here are involved such matters as budget- 
ing, cost comparisons, financial accounting, indebtedness, 
fixation of responsibility, and the financial aspects of school 
publicity.
-P-A-G-E-45
  PROBLEMS OF SCHOOL FINANCE 31 
2. The State problem; — that of apportioning the burden 
of school support equitably among the various units par- 
ticipating in that support, and of devising efficient ways and 
means for collecting and distributing the money. Specifi- 
cally, the participation of district, county, State, and Nation 
are discussed under this head. 
3. The State and local problem; — that of determining the 
best available sources of school revenue, for each of the 
units involved in school support. This problem is an aspect 
of the larger problem of the reform of public taxation. 
In the next three sections, each of these problems will be 
outlined at some length. 
The local problem. Every local administrator at some 
time or other faces the problem of putting the financial 
affairs of his school or system upon a better business basis. 
The best background for a plea for increased support for 
schools is tangible evidence that the money already be- 
stowed has been wisely expended, and that the schools are 
practicing the principles of economy and efficiency that are 
applied in successful private business. Not infrequently, 
perhaps, the introduction of better business management 
into the affairs of a school system will remove the need for 
added funds, by making available for proposed new services 
money formerly wasted upon the old ones. In any case, 
school administrators cannot honestly ask for more money to 
spend unless they are already doing the most good possible 
with what they have. Says Engleman: ! 
These are days when States and cities as well as individuals feel 
the economic pressure and financial stress.... At sucha time it is 
but natural that the question is raised as to whether too much 
money is being spent by our public schools or not, whether they are 
economically administered, whether too much money is given for 
teaching of fads and frills and non-essentials.

May, 1923, p. 192.  
-P-A-G-E-46
    32 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
Such questions must be faced first of all by school authorities 
themselves. They must be able to justify their expenditures. 
They should be willing, even anxious, to practice every reasonable 
economy. Waste, graft, extravagance, poor business management, 
should not be tolerated at any time, and least of all to-day. 
The first problem of public school finance, that of manag- 
ing more economically and efficiently the money appropri- 
ated for the schools, must be met and solved locally by school 
boards and superintendents. For this reason it has been 
called the “local” problem. 
The State problem. It has heen well established that the 
State is the responsible and authoritative unit for the support 
and control of public schools. By the word “State,” in this 
connection, is meant each of the forty-eight commonwealths 
which together comprise the Nation. Such educational 
authority and responsibility as are held by other political 
entities — the Nation, counties, townships, cities, and local 
school districts — were secured originally, and are still re- 
tained, by the gratuity of the State or States. In the field 
of school finance, the State is ultimately responsible for pro- 
viding adequate support. The extent to which the State 
itself should assume this burden, and the extent to which it 
should transfer the burden to other supporting units, are 
phases of the problem which must be determined and sanc- 
tioned by the State. 
Another aspect of this problem has to do with the collec- 
tion and distribution of school funds. In the last analysis 
most school money, wherever and however it may have beer 
accumulated, must be expended by the district or some other 
local unit. The problem here concerns particularly the 
bases upon which to distribute the money among the local 
units; such as the scholastic basis, the teacher basis, the at- 
tendance basis, etc. It also concerns the purposes, such as 
general school maintenance, vocational training, secondary
-P-A-G-E-47
  PROBLEMS. OF SCHOOL FINANCE 33 
education, etc., for which the money is to be expended. 
Here again the problem is a State problem, because the 
policies pursued must be determined and enforced by the 
State. 
The State and local problem. The distinctively local 
problem, as has been seen, is that of achieving an economical 
and business-like administration of school finance. The 
distinctively State problem is that of defining the units of 
school support, of apportioning the burden among them, 
and of working out an effective system for the collection and 
distribution of school funds. We now arrive at the third 
major problem of public school finance, which presents 
itself on both the State and local levels. i 
This problem has to do with the sources of revenue for 
schools. In general, as ‘stated in the first chapter, these 
sources are of three sorts — interest-bearing funds, inci- 
dental sources, and taxes. But the last of these sources so 
far transcends the others in the part that it plays that this 
third problem is primarily a problem of taxation. 
In a sense the problem of taxation, like the problem of 
units of support, is one for State solution and enforcement. 
In taxation, as in education, the State is the center of 
authority. Strictly speaking, there are as many taxation 
“systems” in the United States as there are States. 
Changes in these systems will have to be adopted by each 
individual commonwealth for itself. But in another and 
better sense it is a problem for both the State and the local 
community to adjust. So large a proportion of school taxes 
are locally levied and collected, and the efficiency of the 
schools is so largely dependent upon this manifestation of 
local interest, that the place and function in the taxation 
scheme of all local subdivisions must be carefully considered. 
For this reason we have classed this third problem as both 
“State” and “local” in character.  
-P-A-G-E-48
  34 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
Emphasis upon the local problem. This book is written 
primarily for the service of superintendents and school 
board members in the field, and of students preparing for 
the work of superintending. Its emphasis, therefore, will 
be placed upon those phases of school finance which are 
of greatest local practical importance. Matters chiefly of 
theoretic interest, and matters which concern State officers 
more than local officers, will be subordinated. In line with 
this purpose, most of our attention will be given in these 
pages to the proper administration of local school finance. 
The discussion of different phases of this first or local 
problem will therefore occupy the next six chapters of this 
book. Chapters IX, X, and XI will be given over to the 
study of the units of school support, and the methods of 
collecting and distributing school money. Chapter XII 
will be devoted to the problem of tax reform, in so far as the 
public schools are concerned therein, in an effort to discover 
the most promising sources of revenue for the schools. 
All of these latter chapters should be of interest to super- 
intendents, both actual and prospective, and to progressive 
members of boards of education. Upon these superintend- 
ents and board members we must largely depend for leader- 
ship in creating public sentiment sympathetic with educa- 
tional reforms. They should therefore be enlightened as to 
the reforms that are needed, but the day-to-day work of 
handling local school finances is to them of more direct 
practical importance, and as a consequence will receive the 
greater portion of our space and attention. 
The superintendent’s need for business training. Writ- 
ers in the field of school administration, when discussing 
the qualifications desired in a good superintendent of 
schools, incline to stress the need for the qualities of pro- 
fessional leadership as distinguished from the qualities of 
a mere business administrator. “The superintendent of
-P-A-G-E-49
  PROBLEMS OF SCHOOL FINANCE 35 
schools,” says Cubberley, ! for example, “should be primarily 
an educational leader, and, while he must of necessity handle 
many matters in many different fields, he should in partic- 
ular stand out as the head of the educational department of 
the school system.” 
The present writer has no desire to take issue with this 
statement. The school is administered for educational 
purposes; its financial business exists that the greater busi- 
ness of education may go on; and it is entirely proper that 
the leader and formulator of policies for the schools should 
be first of all an expert in education. 
It is in line with the theme of this book, though, to stress 
an opposite truth; i.e., that the superintendent of schools 
should be not only a trained and experienced educator, but 
also a thoroughgoing business man. Under his direction is 
put a large business enterprise, involving the expenditure of 
considerable sums of money, which, in private affairs, would 
call for seasoned business experience or careful business 
training. The superintendent’s need for good business in- 
telligence is especially evident in the management of the 
public money entrusted to his care. To this end he should 
know, and should utilize for the benefit of the school which 
he controls, the methods which good business men have 
found effective in the conduct of their private affairs. 
The use of up-to-date business methods in school financial 
transactions is required, not only for the welfare of the 
school, but also for the personal welfare of the superintend- 
ent. A superintendent of schools depends for his profes- 
sional success upon the good opinion of his board and com- 
munity. These are often incapable of judging of his merits 
asan educator. For recognition in this line he must turn to 
his teachers, his fellow educators, and his own professional 
conscience. On the school board, though, and in the com- 
1 Cubberley, E. P.: Public School Administration, p. 177. Houghton 
Mifflin Co., 1922,
-P-A-G-E-50
  36 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
munity which he serves as well, will be found a number of 
business men, who will naturally take his measure in busi- 
ness terms. The superintendent who is prepared to meet 
these men in their own field, and to discuss and handle busi- 
ness matters in a business-like way, will find an easier road 
to travel into their confidence and codperation. The result 
will be an asset, not only to the superintendent personally; 
but also to the school. 
Better business methods required of school boards. 
The superintendent is not the only public school officer of 
whom good business management should be demanded. 
A similar requirement should be made of the members of the 
board for school control. In modern interpretations of the 
functions and qualifications of this board, the business-like 
supervision of the management of the school is especially 
emphasized. Cubberley’s description of good school board 
members, and of the opposite sort, is in order at this place.! 
Men who are successful in the handling of large business under- 
takings — manufacturers, merchants, bankers, contractors, and 
professional men of large practice — would perhaps come first. 
Such men are accustomed to handling business rapidly; are usually 
wide-awake, sane, and progressive; are not afraid to spend money 
intelligently; and are in the habit of depending upon experts for 
advice, and for the execution of administrative details; and have 
the tact and perseverance necessary to get the most efficient service 
out of everybody from the superintendent down. Such men, too, 
think for themselves, can resist pressure, and can explain the rea- 
sons for their actions. ... 
On the other hand, the list of those who do not make good school 
board members is much larger. Inexperienced young men, un- 
successful men, old men who have retired from business, politi- 
cians, saloon-keepers, uneducated or relatively ignorant men, men 
in minor business positions, and women, are usually considered as 
undesirable for board membership. All such persons tend to deal 
too much with details to miss the importance of large points of

PROBLEMS OF SCHOOL FINANCE 37 
view, and to assume executive authority when and where they 
should not.... 
In this quotation large stress is given to business capacity 
and experience as qualifications for membership on the board 
for school control. Such an emphasis is entirely proper. 
The modern school board is not expected to take the initia- 
tive in formulating new educational policies, and it is not 
expected to administer those policies. Both of these func- 
tions belong to the superintendent of schools. Board mem- 
bers are expected to bring a sane, matter-of-fact intel- 
ligence to bear in criticizing the policies proposed by the 
superintendent, and to exercise good business judgment in 
controlling and supervising the business side of his admin- 
istration. This latter phase of their duties is the matter of 
emphasis at this point. 
Deficiencies in school financial management. It is prob- 
able that schools are as well administered on the financial 
side as are most other public enterprises. In fact, there is 
less scandal, and less evidence of maladministration, in the 
history of school finance than in most other phases of public 
financial history. It is not improbable that the average 
school is at least as well conducted as is the average private 
business. Nevertheless, there is plenty of room for im- 
provement in the management of school finance. 
One needs only a cursory acquaintance with current 
school affairs, especially in the smaller districts, to realize 
that the standards of financial management which are most 
respected in the business world are not always put into effect 
by school boards and superintendents. Advance planning 
of school expenditures with reference to income is perhaps 
the exception rather than the rule. The incurring of in- 
debtedness for current maintenance, always recognized in 
business as bad practice where possibly avoidable, is be- 
coming all too common in the schools. Perhaps the most  
-P-A-G-E-52
  38 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
convincing evidence of bad business management is this 
tendency to burden the future with large school debts, 
which must often be paid after the benefits to be derived 
from the indebtedness have been exhausted. Even in the 
matter of routine financial accounting, we find in vogue 
the most haphazard and inconsistent methods in various 
schools. The full nature and extent of these deficiencies in 
business management will be brought out in appropriate 
connections later. 
The responsibility for these deficiencies rests mainly upon 
school boards and superintendents. ‘These officials have 
directly in charge the business conduct of the schools. In 
the smaller districts the reason lies mainly in the fact that 
neither superintendents nor board members have had ex- 
perience with large business matters or in modern business 
methods. In the larger school systems the fault is due most 
frequently to the superintendents’ lack of business training 
and to an unfortunate selection of board members. Even 
where the membership of the board is what it should be, so 
far as business experience is concerned, it not infrequently 
happens that these gentlemen fail to take school business 
as seriously as they take their own affairs. Asa consequence 
they permit themselves to be satisfied with forms of proce- 
dure in school finance that they would never tolerate in the 
business world. The only remedy, in all of these instances, 
is to train the superintendent of schools in modern business 
methods, especially in connection with finance. 
An attempted remedy which is appearing in some school 
systems is that of elevating the business manager of the 
school to a rank codrdinate with that of the superintendent 
of schools, and of placing upon him full responsibility for 
business and financial administration. The arguments pro 
and con on this matter will be reviewed in a later chapter. 
Here we need only note, first, that this remedy is possible
-P-A-G-E-53
  PROBLEMS OF SCHOOL FINANCE 39 
only in those large city systems which can afford to maintain 
such an officer, and second, that the removal from the su- 
perintendent of final responsibility for any feature of the 
school’s administration is at least a questionable procedure, 
Most school-men believe that the business side of the su- 
perintendent’s training and experience should be carefully 
cultivated. 
Specific needs of local school finance. The specific im- 
provements needed in the financial administration of the 
schools may be summarized under six heads, as follows: 
1. There is needed everywhere a more careful, scientific, 
and systematic planning of school expenditures, each year in 
advance. This procedure is generally described as budget- 
making. Many schools now operate without any sort of 
formal budget. Even where it is used, the planning is often 
done so superficially as to be of little real service. Yet there 
exists a definite procedure for budget-making; a procedure 
that has been standardized in business and public finance, 
and tested and found to be efficient by many schools. The 
first great need is for the practically universal adoption by 
the schools of this budget-making procedure. 
2. As a basis for intelligent budget-making, and also as 
a means for determining and demonstrating new financial 
policies for the schools, there is needed in education a wider 
use of comparative unit-costs. Every phase of school activity 
should be subjected to the closest scrutiny, and results should 
be measured against expenditures in terms of clearly defin- 
able units, in a way that will make possible a comparison of 
costs and results in any school or field of educational activity 
with those in any other school or field. Only in this way can 
norms or standards of school expenditures be ascertained. 
Here again school-men may take their cue and model their 
methods from what is being done in industry and business. 
8. There is need for a simple, accurate, up-to-the-minute, 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  40 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
and uniform system of financial accounting. The principles 
of such accounting have already been standardized in busi- 
ness. It is only necessary to adapt these principles to the 
needs of the schools. Much progress has been made in this 
direction; the lead having been courageously taken by 
State departments of education, by progressive superintend- 
ents and business managers, and by the National Education 
Association in collaboration with the United States Bureau 
of Education. The need at present is for the adaptation and 
general adoption of the accounting system for schools con- 
structed by these authorities. 
4. School administrators and board members need to 
know when and how to go into debt, or, more particu- 
larly, when and how to keep out of it. The bonding privi- 
lege, and the privilege of incurring other forms of school in- 
debtedness, are very much abused at the present time. A 
similar abuse appears in other fields of the public service. 
The result is a load of indebtedness that is coming to be 
almost crushing in many places. School authorities should 
know with certainty when going into debt is justifiable, and 
when it is not; and they should also know just what form of 
indebtedness is most appropriate to the end to be accom- 
plished. 
5. Another aspect of local financial management is that 
of locating the financial control. At present there is a differ- 
ence of opinion among recognized authorities, as well as a 
difference in practice, as to whether school authorities or 
other public authorities should have the final word in con- 
structing and expending the school budget. There is also 
a difference in both opinion and practice as to the proper 
distribution of authority in financial matters between the 
board of education, the business manager, and the superin- 
tendent. The trend of professional opinion in these matters 
is quite clear, and should be known.
-P-A-G-E-55
PROBLEMS OF SCHOOL FINANCE 41 
6. Lastly, the schools need to adopt modern methods of 
financial publicity. In education, as in business, there is a 
commodity to be exchanged for a price; and in general the 
quality of the product will be proportional to the price paid 
for it. It is here that the psychological aspect of the school 
financial problem is brought most definitely into focus. The 
people, who pay the bills, must be informed about the 
purposes, accomplishments, and unsatisfied needs of the 
schools. This work must be accomplished with a strict re- 
gard for truth, but also in such a way as to win the public’s 
confidence and material codperation. To use a trite and 
somewhat misleading phrase, the schools must learn to 
“sell themselves and their work” to the people. 
Chaptersummary. In this chapter the problems of public 
school finance have been presented as three in number, in- 
cluding: (1) the local problem of improving the financial 
management of individual schools and systems; (2) the 
State problem of defining and adjusting the various units 
of school support; and (3) the State and local problem of 
determining the best sources of revenue for schools and of 
revising the taxation system to make these sources available. 
The emphasis, it has been shown, will be placed upon the 
first or local problem. 
The solution of this local problem has been seen to in- 
volve six specific reforms. School expenditures must be 
planned in advance of each fiscal period, with reference to 
known revenues; in other words, the schools must adopt the 
business-like procedure of budget-making. Continuous 
studies must be made of comparative unit-costs in educa- 
tion, to set up norms of expenditure, and to find a basis for 
evaluating the expenditures of any local school. A simple 
system, adequate and uniform, of financial accounting 
should be adopted by all schools. The first two reforms are 
impossible without this third one. Schools must use dis-
-P-A-G-E-56
  42 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
cretion when going into debt, to avoid both needless in- 
debtedness and needlessly burdensome forms. A proper 
division of authority in financial administration must be 
worked out for local school authorities. Finally, the schools 
must adopt truthful but effective methods and devices for 
“selling” themselves and their wares to the consuming 
public. 
Each of these six reforms will form the theme for a subse- 
quent chapter. In other words, the next six chapters of this 
book will discuss these six activities, in the order in which 
they have been presented here. Chapter III, therefore, will 
take up the discussion of the school budget.

  CHAPTER III 
THE SCHOOL BUDGET 
Purpose of this chapter. In this chapter the discussion 
centers on the first of the several measures proposed for im- 
proving the financial management of schools. This measure 
is the school budget. The main topics for discussion will 
include the meaning of the budget; its use’ in industry, 
government, and education; the proper procedure in budget- 
making; and the values of the budget. While matters of 
theory will not be entirely neglected, emphasis will be placed 
upon the practical problems in this field which are most 
likely to trouble school authorities. 
Meaning of the budget. Although seemingly regarded by 
not a few school-men as a mysterious and intricate instru- 
ment of high finance, the budget is in fact a very simple and 
common-sense affair. The following statements will help to 
remove misconceptions about its nature. Says Mason: 1 
The budget is a financial statement covering a fiscal year in ad- 
vance, showing the anticipated revenue and apportioament oF a 
body having control of the distribution of funds. 
Moore, in his consideration of the budget, says: ? 
We see that the budget has two sides, an expenditure side and a 
revenue side. We notice further that it is a statement of revenues 
and expenditures for a definite period of future time. When an 
estimate of the probable revenues and of the proposed expendi- 
tures has been drawn up into a form to be used as a financial plan 
for a definite period of future time, we have a budget.

Arts’ Thesis written at the University of Texas in 1923.

Another author,! treating of a national budget, writes: 
There is nothing mysterious about a budget.... It can be so 
stated that any business man, no matter how small his affairs, 
every farmer who possesses a head, every man in any way charged 
with the care of funds for another will at once perceive that a na- 
tional budget must be desired and sought by all citizens who wish 
to have business-like methods applied to the one big business of the 
nation — its government. It does not pfesume to introduce radi- 
cal principles into our government; it does not in fact presume to 
introduce anything except system — an orderly and intelligible 
way of doing things that are now being done in a slip-shod and 
systemless manner. 
The budget, then, is only a “complete financial plan for a 
definite period which is based upon a careful estimate of 
expenditures to be made and of probable income.” Its 
objects are to keep expenditures within income, and to ap- 
portion available funds among the different objects of ex- 
penditure so as to accomplish the most good. Instead of 
being intricate, the simpler the form that the budget can 
take, the better; and instead of being a mysterious feature of 
financial operations on a large scale, it is the plain result of 
applying sane, matter-of-fact intelligence to the problem of 
planning expenditures, whether large or small. It naturally 
had its beginnings in places where expenditures were heavy, 
as in large industrial enterprises and in government. But 
it has rapidly extended to all kinds of business enterprises, 
large and small; and to other fields of public service, includ- 
ing the schools; and, in the guise of the “family budget,” it 
has even penetrated into the domain of household finance. 
Procedure in budget-making. The following outline of 
procedure in school budget-making is a paraphrase of a de- 
scription of the process in industry and government. The 
procedure here outlined * is adapted to conditions found in

large school systems, but it furnishes a standard or back- 
ground for developing a procedure appropriate to any 
system. 
(1) Some time before the beginning of the school year each de- 
partment of the school prepares an estimate of its expendi- 
tures for the year. For instance, the science department, 
the history department, the Latin department, and each 
other department will prepare such an estimate. 
(2) The heads of the departments will transmit these estimates 
with their approval to some official, usually the business 
manager, who is appointed to receive the separate estimates 
and formulate them into a combined estimate for all depart- 
ments. 
(8) The business manager, or some other official, prepares an 
estimate of the revenues for the fiscal year. He then sub- 
mits a report to the superintendent of schools showing a 
comparison of the estimated expenditures witb the estimated 
revenues. 
(4) The superintendent and the school board consider the esti- 
mates received from the business manager. The department 
heads may be called into conference to give reasons for any 
increases requested for their departments. 
(5) If the estimated expenditures exceed the estimated revenues 
one of the following may be done: 
a. Expenditures may be reduced. 
b. Revenues may be increased. 
c. Additional funds may be secured by borrowing. 
(6) After the superintendent and school board have decided on 
the plan which is deemed desirable, the proposed budget 
with such recommendations as are necessary is submitted to 
the legislative body which is responsible for transforming it 
into law. In most instances this will be the school board. 
(7) When the budget has been approved by this body, it then 
becomes the working program for the various departments of 
the school for the year.

-P-A-G-E-62
  48 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
(8) Proper records are kept that all expenditures of each depart- 
ment may be charged against its budgetary appropriation. 
Periodic reports are made to the superintendent or his re- 
presentatives showing comparisons between estimated and 
actual expenditures. 
In the foregoing account, the school department heads are 
made responsible for the original estimates of proposed ex- 
penditures, and the business manager of the school is given 
the duty of assembling the original estimates and checking 
them against anticipated income. In many, perhaps in 
most, school systems the first of these duties would fall to 
the school principals (of elementary schools, especially), 
while the second would fall to the superintendent of schools. 
Perhaps this arrangement is to be preferred. This question 
is a detail of admipistrative organization, however, rather 
than of budget-making. The outline of procedure is the 
same in either case. 
Another plan of procedure to be followed in budget- 
making is found in Buck’s “cycle of operations.” Buck’s 
statement! of this cycle is as follows: 
Effective budget-making procedure constitutes a complete cycle 
of operations. The recording of information may be taken as the 
beginning of the cycle. Next comes the preparation of the esti- 
mates, then the examination and careful weighing of these esti- 
mates in the light of experience and recorded data, and then the 
formulation, review, and adoption of the financial plan for the 
future period. Following this is the execution of the plan and 
the recording of more information to be used in the preparation 
of the next budget. 
Upon this cycle Moore bases an analysis of the process of 
budget-making into five steps: (1) collecting the necessary 
information; (2) classifying the information; (3) drafting the 
budget; (4) presenting and adopting the budget; and (5) 
1 Buck, A. E.: Budget-Maling (1921), pp. 3-4. D. Appleton and Com- 
pany, publishers.
-P-A-G-E-63
  THE SCHOOL BUDGET 49 
administering the budget. Because of their value as a 
practical guide to the administrator in formulating and 
securing the adoption of a budget for his school, these five 
steps are made the basis of organization for the discussion 
which follows. 
1. The collection of information 
Why information is needed. At least three reasons make 
necessary the accumulation of a considerable body of in- 
formation in advance of the drafting of the budget. 
First, information is needed as to the amount of money 
that may be appropriated in the budget. The total size of 
the budget can be determined only upon the basis of what is 
known about probable income and needs. 
Second, information is necessary to enable the budgeting 
authorities to apportion the funds properly among the differ- 
ent departments and types of service in the school. Only 
adequate information can prevent an unduly large budget, 
or a budget in which certain departments or types of service 
flourish at the expense of other types or departments. 
Third, information is necessary to enable the makers of 
the budget to convince the school board or other legislative 
authority that it represents actual needs. The same in- 
formation is useful to the board and superintendent later, as 
well, to convince the public that the money raised for the 
schools is being wisely expended. But the immediate need 
is to enable the superintendent to justify his budgetary re- 
quests before the board. In this connection one author 
writes:1 
The advocate of pure water or clean streets shows how much the 
death rate will be altered by each proposed addition to his share of 
the budget. — Only the teacher is without such figures. What can 
be expected of this but a curtailment of the school budget?

-P-A-G-E-64
    50 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
What information is needed. From one viewpoint, the 
information needed in budget-making can be classified 
under three heads. Responsible authorities should know: 
(1) what amount of money will be available for the fiscal 
period covered by the budget; (2) what purchases for school 
.purposes will have to be made during that period; and (3) 
what each of these purchases will probably cost. From 
another viewpoint the required information can be classified 
into (1) information about the previous financial policies 
of the school and (2) information about the desirability of 
changing these policies and about the nature of the changes 
that should be made. 
The requisite information about the school’s resources will 
comprise a knowledge of the amounts of the State and 
county apportionments from the distributive school funds, 
the amounts to be expected from legislative appropriations, 
the local rate of taxation for school purposes, the valuation 
of the property upon which the school taxes are based, the 
rate of valuation, and full data regarding income from other 
sources. Where the budget is framed before the tax-rate for 
the coming period has been determined (this is most de- 
sirable), that part of the information might be disregarded. 
Another helpful type of information bearing upon the 
amount of money that should be available for the schools 
can be drawn from a study of the relative expenditures for 
schools and for other lines of public service, in the city and 
in other cities of similar size which are similarly situated. 
This type of study will be illustrated in the next chapter. 
Investigations about prospective purchases of materials 
and services will consider, first, purchases that are indis- 
pensable, such as teaching, administrative, supervisory, and 
janitorial services, and the necessary supplies for teaching; 
second, purchases that are highly desirable, such as equip- 
ment and services for the teaching of other than the funda-
-P-A-G-E-65
  
THE SCHOOL BUDGET 51 
mental subjects; and third, purchases that are desirable if 
funds will permit. Another helpful grouping of information 
as to prospective purchases is into, first, purchases necessary 
to sustain activities already established in the policy of the 
schools, and second, purchases necessary to install new and 
untried activities. Information along all of these lines is 
essential to intelligent budget-making. 
Information about the probable cost of purchases pro- 
posed will embrace a mass of facts about what similar pur- 
chases have cost the school in the past, and about what they 
are costing other schools or systems. Price trends, and the 
probable level of future prices, must also be considered. 
In this connection the studies of unit-costs in education 
reported in the next chapter will be found helpful. As one 
writer states:” 
To estimate accurately the cost of services, supplies, materials, 
and equipment, they should be reduced to the unit basis.... The 
cost of each unit can then be estimated by the budget-making 
authorities in the light of past and present prices and the trend of 
prices for the future. It is then only a matter of multiplying the 
quantities estimated to be required by the cost of these various 
units and totaling the results to determine the total cost of the 
work. 
The previous financial policies of the system will be re- 
vealed by the records and preserved in the memories of the 
board members and the superintendent, but the informa- 
tion needed for determining the changes that should be made 
in these policies will be extremely varied, and must come 
from many sources. Here is one of the places where the pro- 
fessional, up-to-date superintendent should justify his posi- 
tion as expert advisor of the board. 
Sources of information. The information that is needed 
as a prelude to budget-making must be searched for both 
1 Buck, A. E.: op. cit., p. 34. D. Appleton and Company, publishers, 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
52 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
inside and outside the school system. For inside informa- 
tion the administrator will naturally turn to the school 
accounting system and to the teaching and supervisory 
personnel. The accounting system should be a mine of in- 
formation about expenditures of past years; and the teach- 
ers, department heads, supervisors, and principals should 
be drawn on mainly for advice about the changing and de- 
veloping needs of the school. 
Other types of information must come from sources out- 
side the school. More or less complete and dependable in- 
formation about probable revenues can be got from the tax 
officials and from State and county departments of educa- 
tion. The probable cost of proposed new services can be es- 
timated from information gathered from schools in which 
these services are being supported. The school surveys, 
and the reports of unit-cost studies in the educational lit- 
erature, will also be found fruitful of much valuable in- 
formation. E 
Information should be collected continuously. Often 
the business of collecting information is postponed until 
the last minute, and only remembered when the task of 
budget-making is full upon the school authorities. Then 
such information as is at hand is hastily laid hold of, but is 
almost sure to be superficial and likely to be erroneous. 
Such a procedure makes of the resulting budget a very un- 
reliable affair. Generally, it results in the mere duplication 
of the last current budget, with perhaps a slight propor- 
tional increase in all funds. Good budget-making con-- 
sists not merely in increasing appropriations, but also in 
increasing the wisdom governing the distribution of ex- 
penditures. Such growth in wisdom is the product of con- 
stant study. 
Teachers, department heads, supervisors and principals, 
janitors, and all other employees doing routine duty in the
-P-A-G-E-67
a THE SCHOOL BUDGET 53 
schools should be encouraged to keep memoranda of new 
needs observed, or of needs now inadequately provided for. 
These memoranda should find their way regularly into the 
hands of the budget-making officers. At the proper season 
they should be tabulated, in an effort to find out where new 
money is most needed or where the regular revenues can be 
most helpfully applied. Studies, by the superintendent 
and others, of the results of school activities in relation to 
their cost, should go on continuously. The superintendent 
should also keep in constant touch with the periodical 
literature on school costs. It is only by ceaseless alertness 
that the wisest distribution of the available funds of the 
school among the multitudinous services that are clamoring 
for support can be determined. It is well to remember that 
no budget, however good, can remain static for long. School 
needs are constantly changing, and budgetary practices 
must change to correspond. Here again appears the neces- 
sity for the continuous collection of information. 
2. Classifying the information 
Importance of classification. “One of the most important 
steps in the process of budget-making is the classification of 
the materials. It insures uniformity of presentation, and 
makes for accuracy in planning. It facilitates the gathering 
and compiling of the data, and it makes easier the reviewing 
and revising of the estimates.”! 
The form that the classification takes will, of course, 
largely determine its usefulness. ‘To be most useful, it 
should follow as closely as possible the form of the final 
budget. If this is accomplished, the various items of the 
budget will grow naturally and inevitably out of the in- 
formation collected, and this information will naturally and 
effectually sustain the budget-making officers in disputes 
1 Moore, L. H., op. cit., p. 28. 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  54 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
before the board or with the public. If the materials are 
classified upon one basis, while the budget is constructed 
upon another, there may be great difficulty in deriving the 
budget from the data, and also in using the data to sustain 
the budget. 
General classification. As in the budget itself, the most 
general classification of the materials secured is according 
to their bearing upon (1) anticipated revenues and (2) pro- 
posed expenditures. All of the information obtainable will 
group itself readily under these two heads. 
Classifying information bearing upon revenues. The 
information about probable revenues is usually most readily 
classified according to the sources from which the revenues 
will be derived. This is also the accepted classification for 
the revenue items in the completed budget. As a rule this 
classification is made under three heads, as follows: (1) 
State and county distributive school funds; (2) local tax 
revenues; and (3) incidental revenues from other sources. 
The facts which comprise the information bearing upon the 
revenue side of the budget will be various in nature, but they 
can usually be grouped in this way. 
Classifying information bearing upon expenditures. 
Buck has made a study of the various classifications that 
might be used in formulating the governmental budget, and 
concludes that a composite classification based upon the 
organization unit, and the character and the object of the 
expenditures, is the most desirable one from a practical 
standpoint. By “organization unit” he means any bureau, 
department, division, or institution of government under 
a responsible head. In a budget for a school system this 
basis would appear, if at all, in the form of separate pro- 
visions for different departments or schools. By an “object 
classification” Buck means a classification that designates 
the services, commodities, or obligations for which expendi-
-P-A-G-E-69
  
THE SCHOOL BUDGET 55 
tures are to be made; and by a “character classification” 
he means one that differentiates expenditures for current 
expenses, fixed charges, acquisition of property, and the 
redemption of debts. A combination of these two classifi- 
cations for one organization unit would be as follows: 
I. Current expenses (character) 
1. Personal services (object) 
2. Supplies and materials (object) 
8. Repairs and replacements (object) 
4, Communication and transportation (object) 
II. Fiscal charges (character) 
5. Interest (object) 
6. Pensions and retirement salaries (object) 
7. Grants and subsidies (object) 
III. Acquisition of property (character) 
8. Equipment (object) 
9. Buildings, new construction (object) 
10. Lands (object) 
IV. 11. Payments for debt (character and object) 
The unit classification is necessary in order to fix the 
responsibility for expenditures. The character classifica- 
tion is necessary as an index to the possible means of 
financing the expenditures. The object classification is 
necessary to show the expenditures in concrete terms so that 
they may be seen and understood by every one. 
For educational purposes, the form of classification for 
the data bearing upon expenditures would be like that of the 
schedule presented below. This schedule might be made 
out for the whole school system, or, if desired, a separate 
schedule could be constructed for each school or other or- 
ganization unit in the system.

The foregoing schedule is usually approximated in the 
organization, on the expenditure side, of the completed 
school budget. It also follows rather closely the form of 
the financial accounting system accepted by the best 
schools. It meets Buck’s requirements for a combined 
character and object classification. Finally, it gives a clear 
and comprehensive view of the local financial situation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
THE SCHOOL BUDGET 57 
For these reasons it offers a very serviceable plan for the 
classification of information about proposed expenditures. 
8. Drafting the budget 
Procedure in drafting the budget. After the information 
needed in budget-making has been collected and classified, 
the persons responsible for the construction of the budget 
should be in a position to make the first draft. This draft 
will indicate three separate things: 
(1) It will show the anticipated revenues for the coming fiscal 
period, probably classified as to sources. 
(2) It will show the various items of contemplated expenditure, 
classified according to character and object, in terms similar 
to those of the schedule given in the preceding section of this

(8) It will show the amount of each individual expenditure for 
each separate character and object; or, stated differently, it 
will show the proposed apportionment of the revenues among 
the various appropriation items of the budget 
Drafting the revenue side. One part of the budget will 
comprise a summary of the school’s anticipated income for 
the next fiscal year. The revenues are usually presented in 
terms of the sources from which they will be derived; (1) 
from State and county funds; (2) from local taxes; and (3) 
from incidental sources. The total amount of these ex- 
pected revenues should be clearly indicated. 
Drafting the expenditure side. On the side of expendi- 
tures, the problem is twofold; (1) to determine the several 
items of expenditure, and (2) to apportion the expected 
revenues wisely and economically among these several items. 
If the preliminary collection and classification of informa- 
tion have been what they should be, little difficulty will be 
experienced at this point. The items in the information 
classification will comprise the major items of expenditure

as set down in the budget. The information should also show 
pretty clearly just how much money is needed for each item. 
In connection with the first phase of this problem, it is 
necessary to secure an itemization of expenditures which is 
neither too simple nor too elaborate. At the one extreme is 
the “lump-sum appropriation” type of budget, in which 
little or no direction is given by the legislative authority 
about the distribution of funds. Such a budget is in reality 
no budget at all, for it leaves future expenditures practically 
unplanned. At the other extreme is the budget which is 
itemized down to the minutest details, such as the salaries 
of individual teachers, and the like. This type of budget 
gives no opportunity to the board or administrative officers 
to exercise discretion in the expenditure of funds. It puts 
administrative control practically into the hands of the body 
that passes the budget, and results in a rigid, unyielding 
educational organization, incapable of adjustment or ex- 
pansion. To all practical intent, it is an expression of lack 
of confidence in the ability or integrity of those specifically 
charged with the conduct of the schools. The desirable 
mid-ground between these extremes is well represented in 
the schedule of expenditures set down above, in the “‘classi- 
fication of information.” 
The second phase of the problem — that of determining 
the proportion of the revenues that should be allotted to 
each of the various items — is one that will involve much 
study of comparative costs. Practically the whole of the 
next chapter is applicable at this point. The specific helps 
which may be provided by these comparative cost studies 
are listed in the following section. 
Uses of studies of comparative costs. Scattered through 
the literature on school finance is a growing group of studies 
of unit costs in education. These studies are to be found in 
the professional journals, are issued in bulletin form from
-P-A-G-E-73

various sources, and form important parts of superintend- 
ents’ reports and of school surveys. Chapter IV will sum- 
marize the more important of these studies. At this point 
we shall merely list the special types of help which they can 
give the budget-maker. 
One point upon which the budget-maker can receive help 
from these sources is that of determining the reasonableness 
of his total budgetary requests. Are his requests for money 
exorbitant in the mass, or do they fall below what the 
schools have a right to expect of the community? Some of 
the studies referred to will be of great value in helping to 
answer this question; perhaps more through the methods of 
investigation which they exhibit than because of the con- 
clusions which they present. 
Another point to which these studies can be helpfully 
applied concerns the wisdom of the distribution of the total 
revenues among the various budgetary items. Several 
studies have been made of the actual distribution of funds 
among the items of general control, instruction, operation 
and maintenance of plant, auxiliary agencies, etc. Other 
studies have been made of the relative costs of elementary 
and high schools, of junior high schools, of school grades and 
of school subjects. Since these and simular investigations will 
be reported upon in a more lengthy manner later, it is only 
necessary here to note their close connection with the pro- 
blems of budget-making. But their significance in this con- 
nection should be kept constantly in mind. : 
Limitations on the use of these studies. Some criticism" 
has been advanced of the use of comparative cost studies 
in arriving at the amounts that should be appropriated 
for the different expenditure divisions of the budget. 
Moehlman,' for instance, lists twenty factors which may 
reasonably cause the expenditures of any local school sys- 
1 See the American School Board Journal, March, 1923, p. 13.
-P-A-G-E-74
  
  60 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
tem to vary from any expenditure standards that might be 
set up. It is probably true that there is no hard and fast 
tule that can be applied to the making of appropriations. 
All of the medians and averages that have been computed 
by students of educational finance are valuable to the 
budget-making authorities chiefly as suggestions of what is 
being done elsewhere. If the conditions within a local 
system seem to justify a wide divergence from the standard 
distribution then that divergence should be made. The 
standard, however, will enable the budgeting authorities to 
learn wherein their distribution of expenditures is different 
from the normal one, and will doubtless suggest the wisdom 
of investigation. 
In appropriating money for school purposes, school au- 
thorities should always keep in mind the fact that the pri- 
mary purpose of all school expenditures is to make good 
teaching possible; and it should always be the object of the 
board and superintendent to make the appropriations for 
instruction as large as possible, and the appropriations for 
other things as small as possible, without lowering the ef- 
ficiency of the system. 
A sample budget. The sample budget presented in this 
section has been adapted from several small-city school 
budgets in actual use. In the adaptation only the most con- 
stant items have been included. The form of the budget, 
however, is a very common one.

The merits of this sample budget are rather obvious. It 
summarizes définitely both revenues and expenditures. The
-P-A-G-E-76
  62 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE | 
revenues are classified according to their sources, so that 
later on it will be easy to check revenues received against 
revenues expected, and determine what are yet due. Ex- 
penditures, likewise, are classified according to the most 
generally accepted plan. Only two doubtful features need 
to be noticed. . First, the wisdom of providing for an emer- 
gency balance in the budget is sometimes questioned, espe- 
cially if the intent is to use this balance to increase cer- 
tain funds. Secondly, the budget here presented takes no 
account of separate schools within the system. We may 
assume in this instance that the budget is a composite of 
several tentative budgets, one for each school; or we may 
assume that the needs of the various schools have been con- 
solidated, and that the board is granting to the superintend- 
ent complete freedom in apportioning these appropriations 
among the several schools. Either assumption would accord 
with existing practices in budget-making. 
4. Adopting the budget 
Who should adopt the budget? When the drafting of the 
budget has been completed, it must be presented to the 
proper legislative authority for adoption, to give it force. 
The generally recognized authority for this purpose is the 
school board, although in some places the city council or 
some other non-educational authority has this right. In 
state affairs, all budgets must ultimately receive the sanc- 
tion of the legislature. At present, there is considerable 
discussion of the propriety of allowing this important power 
to reside unimpaired in the hands of local school boards. 
This question, however, will be discussed at length in 
Chapter VII. 
When adopt the budget? The adoption of the budget, 
including the making of any changes from the tentative 
draft that is required by the legislative authority, should be
-P-A-G-E-77
THE SCHOOL BUDGET 63 
completed before the beginning of the fiscal period which it 
is intended to cover. If possible, this adoption should occur 
before employments or purchases are made, or agreements 
involving expenditure are entered into. The general policy 
seems to be to adopt the budget before employing teachers 
for the coming year. 
Presenting the budget for adoption. One of the best tests 
of an efficient superintendent is his ability to get the school 
board to sanction without serious change his budget of pro- 
posed expenditures. Such sanction will mean that the 
superintendent has carefully considered his proposals and is 
asking only for what he can show to be needed. Even then, 
however, it will be found that his manner of approaching the 
board with the budget, and the enlightening information 
that he takes along with him, will be very vital factors in his 
success. 
In case the budget involves a considerable increase over 
the previous one, for the purpose of installing some new 
educational activity or enterprise, the superintendent should 
have won the board’s hearty approval of the new venture 
before the budgetary matter comes up for consideration. To 
prove the value of new ventures and the possibility of fund- 
ing them is usually too much to attempt successfully at one 
time. The desirability of the innovation should have been 
proved before the budgetary question is raised, if possible. 
Here also is the place to make use of the information 
which the superintendent has been collecting throughout 
the year for his own personal guidance in drafting the 
budget. The same information that has led the superin- 
tendent to frame the budget as he has should be of great serv- 
ice in convincing the board that the requests are proper 
ones. What has convinced the superintendent should go a 
long way in convincing the board, but the way in which 
the superintendent marshals this information and arranges it 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  64 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
for presentation may be quite as effective as the information 
itself. Here the reader is referred to the methods and de- 
vices for assembling and presenting information on financial 
matters as set forth in Chapter VIII. 
5. Administering the budget 
Carrying out the program. The budget, when adopted, 
becomes the financial program of all departments of the 
school for the fiscal period. The question naturally arises: 
How rigidly shall it be adhered to after its adoption? There 
are two points of view in this matter. One is that after the 
budgetary items have been approved by the appropriating 
body or bodies, the expenditures should be made as directed 
without further quibble. The other view is that all budget 
items should be reviewed again when the question of ex- 
penditure comes up, regardless of their relationships to re- 
cognized policies. _Moehlman recommends a procedure 
somewhere between these extremes.!_ He writes: 
Budget items that express a standard policy, such as personal 
service, supplies and text-books, generally should be expended as 
the need arises without further review, except to see that the ap- 
propriations are not exceeded. There is always a group of exten- 
sion or experimental items that may be studied and checked in ac- 
cordance with conditions that exist at the time that expenditures 
are desired, for it is highly probable that these conditions have 
changed. If, however, the budget has been carefully and scientifi- 
cally prepared, the greater emphasis will be placed on careful stew- 
ardship, to see that appropriations are not exceeded and that the 
entire financial program is carried out according to the spirit of 
prevailing policies. 
It would seem from this statement that there should be 
no great variation between budget estimates and actual ex- 
penditures. Experience shows this to be generally the case. 
1 Moehlman, A. B., in American School Board Journal, October, 1920, 
p. 43.
-P-A-G-E-79
  
THE SCHOOL BUDGET 65 
In his study of this phase of the question, Baker found ! a 
variation of from one to five per cent, with a median varia- 
tion of three per cent. This variation refers to the extent 
to which actual expenditures exceeded or failed to match the 
appropriation. 
Adjusting to changed conditions. It is not usually practi- 
cal to construct a budget that will call for no readjustments 
during the entire period for which it was intended, although 
as a rule the changes required will be small. But how make 
these changes, whether large or small, when they become 
necessary ? 
Several different methods are in use. One of the most 
common ways is to set aside an emergency or contingency 
fund in the original budget. The value of this method de- 
pends upon the size of the fund so set aside. If it is too 
small the administrative authorities are likely to be cramped 
in their efforts to adjust their appropriations to unforeseen 
circumstances. If, on the other hand, the fund is too large, 
it may encourage waste and thus defeat one of the main 
purposes of budget-making. 
Another plan is to transfer funds from one item of appro- 
priation where the demand has proved small to another item 
where the demand has unexpectedly increased. Such trans- 
fers are usually made only by express permission of the board 
or legislative authority that originally passed the budget, 
because this action means a virtual reconsideration of the 
plan for the whole year. In the case of the school budget 
that plan seems to be growing in favor at the expense of the 
first one mentioned. School boards meet rather frequently, 
so that no great inconvenience is involved for either the 
board members or the officers of administration. 
Still another method of adjustment is through the making 
of new appropriations to meet new needs. ‘This method is 
1 Baker, G. M., in American School Board Journal, December. 1917..n. 20. 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  66 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE ° 
employed infrequently, and is possible only if the board has 
a reserve fund at its disposal, or if the proposed new appro- 
priation is of a sort that will justify going into debt. 
Keeping a check upon expenditures. The main problem 
in administering the budget is that of seeing that expendi- 
tures in the various items do not exceed the appropriations. 
This task falls to the accounting officers, and its discussion 
belongs in a later chapter.’ No serious trouble should arise, 
however, if the accountants are careful, and if the form of 
the accounting system accords with that of the budget. In 
modern book-keeping the records of expenditure are kept 
under headings which conform to the main divisions of the 
budget. For instance, the appropriation for General Con- 
trol is indicated at the top of an accounting ledger sheet, and 
the expenditures for this purpose are posted regularly on this 
same sheet. The same plan is followed with reference to 
other budgetary and expenditure items. It is only a matter 
of a moment to cast a balance between appropriations and 
expenditures on these ledger sheets. The principal difficulty 
will arise when there are large outstanding orders which do 
not show in the ledger expenditure columns. This difficulty 
will be taken up for further discussion in the chapter on 
financial accounting. 
6. Values of the budget 
Values in government and industry. The point has been 
made earlier in this chapter that the budget was carried over 
into the service of education after it had demonstrated its 
merits in the service of industry and government. This 
borrowing was done in the hope that the usefulness shown in 
the older fields would be duplicated in the newer one — 
that the budget would do for the schools what it was be- 
lieved to have accomplished for government and business. 
It seems not beside the point, therefore, to observe the merits
-P-A-G-E-81
  
THE SCHOOL BUDGET 67 
claimed for this financial instrument in these earlier fields of 
its application. 
The advantages held to accrue to an industrial organiza- 
tion in consequence of the use of the budget are described 
by one writer ! as follows: 
1. Every one in the industry will have a definite goal for attain- 
ment. 
2. Sales and production plans can be codrdinated with financial 
resources. 
8. More continuous operation and greater regularity of em- 
ployment can be provided. 
4. Processes, products, and equipment can be standardized. 
5. Costs can be used for purposes of control rather than as his- 
torical information. 
6. Reduction of waste will be encouraged by the maintenance of 
better balanced inventories, by instituting wage payments 
based on results, and by definitely assigning responsibility for 
expenditures. 
The budget, taken in connection with the business cycle, will 
give warning when to be cautious and the cue to go forward 
in manufacturing plans. 
8. At all times the budget serves as a measuring stick to compare 
actual performance with promises and standards. showing 
not only what may be done but what should be done. 3s 
The services of the budget to government on the municipal 
level have been set forth by another writer? in the following 
terms: 
It has compelled department heads in preparing their estimates 
to scan the activities of their departments, not sectionally or in 
general terms, but item by item, through the whole functional 
structure. It has served in a measure the purposes of a balance 
sheet, of an operating statement and of cost accounting, by afford- 
ing an opportunity to match results with expenditures, both of

Science, 1915.

those responsible for obtaining results and of the appropriating 
authorities. It has revealed for the first time to the public the 
scope and range of city activities and has made it possible in many 
instances to prevent unwise expenditures by compelling a detailed 
justification of requests in advance of authorization. 
Values in education. The advocates of the use of the 
budget in school finance believe, of course, that it will bring 
into education the same benefits that it has brought into 
these other fields of financial management. What it has 
done for business and government, they believe, it may be 
expected to accomplish for education. At one time, when 
the school budget was pretty much in its infancy, this type 
of argument by analogy was about all that was possible, 
but to-day the school budget has been so widely and success- 
fully used that its many services and values can be stated 
upon the basis of experience., Moehlman thus describes ! 
the values of the budget, as revealed by its practical use in 
the schools: 
1. It provides a sensible arrangement of appropriation requests. 
2. It affords a form in which these requests may be easily read. 
8. It will show the increases in requests together with the per- 
centage of increases which by checking with the growth of the 
system will determine the justice of the increases. 
4, It is a procedure that follows national practices in its general 
outline and permits of comparisons with budget requests in 
cities of similar size and conditions. 
5. It is a big step in the direction of a unified, standardized, na- 
tional system of recording school expenditures. 
6. It will insure adequate funds and will prevent waste and un- 
necessary expenditures. 
In his thesis study to which reference has already been 
made, Moore includes the answers from superintendents 
of schools in several Texas cities in response to a question

-P-A-G-E-83
  
THE SCHOOL BUDGET 69 
about the advantages which the use of the budget had 
brought to their schools. Some of the replies were as follows: 
We are able to keep all departments equipped on an equal foot- 
ing. 
The budget has reduced our indebtedness, decreased taxes, in- 
creased efficiency, and gained the respect of local business concerns. 
It has resulted in a more accurate and substantial handling of 
school business. 
We know when to extend a given service, and when not to do so. 
We have been able to reduce expenditures and maintain higher 
salaries for teachers; able to adjust expenses to income, and have 
the schools free from debt. 
It has made expenditures definite and clear, and kept one de- 
partment from starving others. It has evenly balanced our edu- 
cational expenditures, and has thrown us in line with the best 
practices of the day in school spending. 
It has put the financial condition of the school on a business-like 
basis. It has developed definite policies for expenditures by the 
board. It has eliminated criticisms directed at the school authori- 
ties for reckless spending. It has given the school authorities a 
chance to show the community the need for the money asked for. 
The budget is the basis for the operation of the school. It isa 
business procedure, necessary to keep within income. It is desira- 
ble in making plans for future growth. It shows us where we are 
and where we are going. 
The statements quoted above are representative of all the 
expressions found upon this subject. If there is dissatisfac- 
tion or disappointment in the minds of school-men as a result 
of their experiences with the budget, such feelings have not 
found their way to expression in the published literature. 
It seems safe to say that, after several years of rather ex- 
tensive use in education, this instrument for the advance 
planning of school expenditures and income has established 
itself beyond any probability of dislodgment. The only  
-P-A-G-E-84
70 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
questions remaining open seem to be those concerned with 
its form and the manner of its administration. These ques- 
tions we have sought to answer in this chapter. 
Chapter summary. The first main problem of this chap- 
ter was that of defining the term budget. This term was 
defined to be a financial plan constructed in advance of a 
given fiscal period, setting forth the expected income and 
proposed expenditures. It was shown to be an acquirement 
from government and industry, which has been tried out 
successfully in the educational field. 
The procedure in making the budget was analyzed into 
five steps: (1) collecting the necessary information; (2) 
classifying this information; (3) drafting the budget; (4) 
adopting the budget; and (5) seeing to its proper administra- 
tion. Each of these steps was discussed in detail in an 
attempt to show the accepted procedure in each case. 
The chapter closed with a statement of the values of the 
budget in industry, in government, and in the school. 
In this chapter we have made several contacts with the 
subjects to be discussed in succeeding chapters. We have 
seen that a better knowledge of unit-costs in education is 
necessary to intelligent budget-making. This subject will 
be taken up in the next chapter. We also have seen that the 
budget is intimately related to the accounting system, both 
formally and functionally. Chapter V, on the accounting 
system, is therefore an outgrowth of this chapter. In draft- 
ing the budget it has also been found necessary to determine 
just what expenditures should be made out of regular rev- 
enues and what ones should be met by borrowing. This 
brings up the problem of bonds and indebtedness, discussed 
in Chapter VI. Chapter VII, concerning the location of final 
authority in school financial matters, will throw further light 
on the question of who should give legal force to the budget, 
and Chapter VIII will furnish help to the budget-maker in

“putting” his product “across” with the board and school 
public. The school budget is thus seen to be very closely 
tied up with all of the other phases of local school finance. 
TOPICS FOR INVESTIGATION AND DISCUSSION 
1. It is frequently stated that a formal budget is wholly unnecessary in a 
small school system. What do you think of this statement? 
2. In what way or ways might the procedure in budget-making described 
in the chapter above be modified so as better to suit the conditions 
existing in a small school system? 
8. To what extent is the budget plan used in the city and village schools 
of your State? In the county or township school organizations? In 
your State department of education? 
4, What recommendations have you to make in the light of your answers 
to the foregoing questions. 
5. What functions are performed by the school superintendent — city, 
county, and State — in school budget-making in your State? By the 
school board? By the school business manager? 
6. To what extent is school budget-making in your State tied up with the 
system or systems of school financial accounting? 
7. Make a collection of sample budgets from representative schools in 
your State, classify them, and criticize each classification.

  CHAPTER IV 
COMPARATIVE COSTS IN EDUCATION 
Purpose of this chapter. The preceding chapter has shown 
the need for knowledge about comparative costs as a basis 
for intelligent budget-making. The review of the numerous 
studies of comparative educational costs, however, has been 
reserved for presentation in this chapter. 
These studies represent one of the most important move- 
ments in modern educational history. It is possibly entitled, 
from the standpoint of its practical importance if not from 
the standpoint of results as yet achieved, to a rank alongside 
of the development of standardized tests and scales for 
measuring the results of teaching. In these tests and 
scales the educational world has found a group of scientific 
instruments for measuring the product of the schools; the 
movement here described is intended to produce somewhat 
similar instruments for measuring school costs. 
Up to the present, however, the results of the movement 
have fallen short of expectations. This result is probably 
due to the extremely complex and fluid nature of the pro- 
blems and data in the field. School costs are an unstable 
entity even in the same locality. In localities which are 
widely separated these costs are likely to be very different. 
The needs to be satisfied vary with time and place; and the 
costs of meeting the same needs in the same place are never 
stationary. It now seems probable that too much was ex- 
pected originally from studies in this direction, and that 
school administrators and students of education will have 
to be satisfied with merely suggestive norms of school ex- 
penditure, rather than with positive directions. The 
practical value of the work that has been done nevertheless
-P-A-G-E-88
  4 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
is very great. No treatment of current school finance would 
be at all complete without a review of the more important of 
the studies which constitute this movement. 
This chapter will present this movement from two main 
aspects. First, it will review a few of the outstanding indi- 
vidual studies in the field, presenting them in the order of 
their chronological appearance. Second, it will state the 
principal problems which have been attacked in these and 
other studies, and will summarize the methods of procedure, 
and the results. Before taking up this analysis, however, 
there are certain important preliminary matters which must 
be mentioned. 
Sources of the movement. One source of the movement 
represented in these studies of unit-costs is like the source 
already given for the school budget. Unit-cost studies had 
proved their usefulness in government and business before 
they were thought of in education. In fact, the methods of 
procedure had been pretty well worked out in these earlier 
fields of application. As in the case of the school budget, 
educators have had merely to take over these methods and 
adapt them to new conditions and new types of data. 
Another source is probably the very movement in the 
direction of subject-matter standards with which we have 
previously compared it. While the quest for norms has 
penetrated many fields of educational activity, the outstand- 
ing search has been for norms of measurement of the class- 
room product. ‘The unit-cost studies in the financial field 
are an embodiment of this same spirit. 
A third source of the movement is to be found in the ob- 
vious need for standards of expenditure in practical admin- 
istration. The value of such standards in guiding the 
budget-maker, both in judging of the size of his total budget 
and in criticizing his distribution of expenditures, has al- 
ready been pointed out. Another line of administrative
-P-A-G-E-89
  
COMPARATIVE COSTS IN EDUCATION 1 
importance is found in the need for more definite informa- 
tion in pushing forward school financial campaigns, and in 
securing greater economies in local expenditures. A com- 
bination of the unit-cost method of approach with the 
standardized methods of measuring the results of teaching 
promises to throw much light upon the efficiency of the 
school’s financial management. 
Bobbitt’s analogy. In connection with the first of the 
sources mentioned in the preceding section, and also as a 
means of showing the purposes of the movement here dis- 
cussed, Bobbitt’s description of the analogy between “cost 
accounting” in industry and education will be enlightening.! 
Accurate cost-accounting lies at the foundation of all successful 
business management. In railroad administration, for example, it 
is known that under usual normal conditions locomotive repair 
costs should average about six cents per mile run; lubricating oils 
should cost about eighteen cents per hundred miles for passenger 
locomotives and about twenty-five cents for freight locomotives; 
and so on for each item involved in the entire management. With 
these cost standards at hand, derived from wide general practice, if 
a railroad manager finds at the end of a year that locomotive re- 
pairs average fifteen cents per mile run, then it is quite evident 
upon the surface that something is wrong somewhere. The rail- 
road is paying too much wages to labor; it is getting too little labor 
for the amount expended; its labor force is working under adverse 
conditions; there is graft in the repair department; or the entire 
outfit of locomotives is in a sad state of depreciation. When the 
cost runs so high above standard, something needs to be investi- 
gated, and either shown to be the result of unusual conditions or 
corrected. If, on the other hand, the repair cost is running at 
three cents per mile on the average, and if unusual conditions do 
not exist, then it appears probable that the locomotives are being 
left to depreciate too rapidly. Cost-accounting is thus seen to be 
one method of diagnosing the situation, and locating irregularities 
in management.

pp. 505-06.

  76 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
In operating a high school, expenditures need to be made for 
many things — general administration, supervision, instruction, 
fuel, janitors, light, power, library, etc. For each of these, stand- 
ard unit costs are needed for judging the efficiency of the manage- 
ment. If it is known, for example, that satisfactory instruction in 
high school English can be had for fifty dollars per one thousand 
student-hours, and that this price represents the norm of practice, 
then those responsible for high school management have a standard 
of judgment that can be used for measuring the efficiency of their 
practices. If the instruction in this subject is costing them seventy- 
five dollars per thousand student-hours, and they are aiming at 
results of only the usual sort, it is evident that they are wasting 
money, and that administrative adjustments need to be made. If 
they are getting the commodity for thirty dollars per thousand 
student-hours, then it is probable that they are practicing so great 
an economy as seriously to injure the quality of the work. 
“Standard” unit-costs in education. In both industry 
and education, the making of cost comparisons centers 
around the principle of standard unit-costs. This principle, 
and its applications to school and railroad management, 
have been set forth in Bobbitt’s illustration. It is further 
discussed, with particular reference to educational affairs, by 
Hutchinson.! . 
The term unit-costs for public education is used to mean the 
total cost of public education, as well as the cost of any part of it, 
divided by the total units of any one kind that determine the total 
cost of education, or any part of it. Thus, some of the kinds of 
units that determine such costs are schools, schoolrooms, subjects 
taught, pupils taught, districts, and city wards. ... 
The word standard contains the idea of authority based on num- 
bers. Standard units are units that have authority because of the 
frequency of their occurrence. Unit-costs of public education 
would be standard when such unit-costs were practically identical 
for many cities. 
The purpose then in determining standard unit-costs of public

COMPARATIVE COSTS IN EDUCATION 17 
education is to provide the school administrator with certain tests 
which, with other tests, especially of the pupils’ abilities, will en- 
able him to determine the efficiency of his own school system by 
comparing the costs... in his own school system with the costs in 
many school systems. 
The plural of the word cost is used because to be worth while the 
study must reveal the standard unit-costs, not only of the one 
great service, public education, but also of the many distinct serv- 
ices that make up public education. That is, to be worth while, 
this study must determine not only the standard total cost for 
public education, i.e., for all schools, but also the standard unit- 
cost for each kind of public education, i-e., for all elementary 
schools, for all high schools. Nor is this sufficient. For all 
schools and for each kind of school there should be determined the 
standard unit-costs for each character of service rendered, i.e., ad- 
ministration, operation, etc. And, finally, to be complete, there 
must be determined for all schools, for each kind of school, and for 
each character of expenditure for each kind of school and for all 
schools, the standard unit-cost of each object of expenditure, as of 
personal service, of supplies, ete. 
It will be observed that the statements of both Hutchinson 
and Bobbitt reflect the ambitious purpose that has been 
mentioned earlier in this chapter, of seeking to find more or 
less absolute standards by which the expenditures, both in 
part and in toto, of any local school system may be approved 
or condemned. This purpose, it is fair to say, has not yet 
been fulfilled. But whether or not this expectation is ever 
realized, experience has demonstrated that such standards 
as have been obtained are serving, and will continue to serve, 
very practical ends. These uses will be discussed at greater 
length after the studies themselves have been reviewed. 
Some prominent studies of comparative costs. The 
large number of studies which have been published in this 
field makes it impossible to give even passing notice to all of 
them in this book. A few, however, are worthy of individual 
attention here. These studies are historically most im: 
portant, being the ones that have given the chief impetus
-P-A-G-E-92
78 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
and direction to the whole movement. A few of these stud- 
ies which have historical significance will be reviewed briefly 
in this section. 
(1) Strayer’s early study of “City School Expenditures.” 
One of the earliest of the studies dealing with comparative 
school costs was published by Strayer in 1905. This study 
sought to find “the distribution of the money spent for 
schools among the various items of the budget.” The data 
upon which the study was based were collected by question- 
naire from fifty-eight cities of between ten and fifty thousand 
inhabitants in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, 
New York, and New Jersey. These data, comprising school 
expenditures in these cities for 1902-03 and 1903-04, were 
classified under current expenses (supervision, janitor serv- 
ice, teaching, supplies, etc.), plant and equipment, debt 
services, and miscellaneous expenditures. At this early date, 
it will be observed, the present standardized itemization of 
the school budget had not been worked out. 
For the purpose of making comparisons, and for ascertain- 
ing expenditure norms, the different types of expenditure 
were reduced to comparable units in terms of (1) the per 
cent of the total expenditure for schools in each city that 
was devoted to each of the various items, and (2) the ex- 
penditure per pupil for each item.- These per pupil costs 
were based, as a rule, upon “the figure halfway between 
the average daily attendance and the average daily enroll- 
ment.” 
School costs have so changed in the twenty years that 
have elapsed since the data for this study were collected, 
that it is hardly worth while to include in this review an 
itemized statement of results. It may be noted, however, 
that the expenditures for teaching ranged from nineteen 
dollars per pupil in one city to fifty-one dollars per pupil in 
another city; and that the percentages of the total school
-P-A-G-E-93
  COMPARATIVE COSTS IN EDUCATION 79 
expenditure devoted to teaching ranged from fifty-four per 
cent in one city to seventy-three per cent in another. The 
median cost per pupil was about twenty-nine dollars and the 
median percentage devoted to teaching was about sixty- 
three per cent.!_ But perhaps the most important finding is 
expressed in the statement that “the most striking thing to 
be noticed is the variability which exists among the cities.” 
The condition revealed by this wide variation in the ex- 
penditures, and in the distribution of expenditures, of the 
different cities became the inspiration for several later 
studies. 
(2) Elliott on the “Fiscal Aspects of Education.” The 
same year that saw the appearance of Strayer’s study also 
witnessed the publication of a study by E. C. Elliott, deal- 
ing with the proportional expenditures of cities for edu- 
cation and for other municipal activities. This study, 
like Strayer’s, is important because of the direction that it 
gave, as to both problems and methods of approach, to later 
studies of city school expenditures, especially in the school 
surveys. 
The data for the study were derived from the statistics for 
cities issued by the Department of Labor, for 1900 and 1901. 
One hundred and thirty-five cities of over thirty thousand 
population were utilized. The municipal expenditures were 
classified under twenty-four heads, including in addition to 
the expenditures for schools, expenditures for police, health, 
fire control, libraries, etc. The problem was to find the 
proportionate expenditures in each of these cities for each 
of these items, and to determine the norms of expenditure 
for the cities as a whole. The percentage unit was used 
throughout. 
1 The term “median” is a statistical term meaning, in this connection, 
that as many cities spent more than the amount or percentage indicated, as 
spent less, and vice versa,
-P-A-G-E-94
  80 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
The time that has elapsed since this study was made 
renders its results relatively useless for comparative pur- 
poses to-day. The study revealed, however, a range in the 
percentages devoted to schools in these cities of from six per 
cent at the one extreme to forty-six per cent at the other. 
The median was twenty-four per cent. 
(3) The Updegraff study. A third important statistical 
study of city school expenditures was published by the 
United States Bureau of Education in 1912, and was the 
work of Harlan Updegraff. This bulletin is important as 
being the first of a series to be issued by the Bureau of Edu- 
cation, and because of the range and classification of the 
cities studied. These cities, one hundred and three in num- 
ber, were grouped into four classes according to their 
populations. ‘The first group of thirteen cities included 
those above 300,000; the other groups were as follows: 
Twenty cities between 100,000 and 300,000, forty-two be- 
tween 50,000 and 100,000, and twenty-eight between 30,000 
and 50,000. ‘The problems studied were: (1) the percentage 
of total school expenditure, in all cities and in each group of 
cities, assigned to each of the main budgetary items; (2) the 
average costs per pupil for each of these main items of ex- 
pense; (3) the total school expenses as compared with popu- 
lation, total city expenditures, and expenditures for the 
police department; and (4) the average cost per pupil in 
elementary and secondary schools. 
Here, as in the studies previously reviewed, the passage 
of time makes a detailed summary of results of little value. 
But the study utilizes a method of summarizing its data 
which has since achieved wide recognition. Because its 
description of this method is clear and simple and yet 
practically correct, and because reference to this method will 
occur frequently in later pages of this book, the following 
quotation is inserted here.
-P-A-G-E-95
  
COMPARATIVE COSTS IN EDUCATION 81 
It has come to be generally accepted that the way in which to 
give the clearest and at the same time the most accurate measure of 
a series of numbers is to state the median of the series and the lim- 
its of the middle fifty per cent. In time past the arithmetical 
mean or average has been used for this purpose, and it still has its 
value. Nevertheless its disadvantages, especially that of the un- 
due weight exercised by a number which is very large or very small 
as compared with the others in the series, are causing the increased 
use of the median wherever possible. 
The determination of the median and of the middle fifty per cent 
requires first the arrangement of the numbers or values in a series 
according to their amounts and then the numbering of the series, 
beginning with the lowest. The median is the amount above and 
below which one half of the members of the series falls. In other 
words, it is the middle one (halfway between the two next the mid- 
dle in case the number of things is even) of the things involved, 
distributed in the order of their amounts or value. Thus, if the 
number of cases or things were seventeen, the ninth case would be 
the median, because there would be eight above and eight below it. 
If the number of cases were sixteen the median would be obtained 
by finding the halfway point between the value of case eight and 
nine. 
The middle fifty per cent is found by various methods. The 
method followed in this study is one of the simplest. By the term 
as it is here used is meant the two limits between which are found 
those cases, amounting to one half of the total number, that are 
nearest the median, one half the middle fifty per cent of the cases 
being below the median and the other half above it. For example, 
if the number of cases were sixteen, cases five to twelve, inclusive, 
would compose the middle fifty per cent, and the amounts of these 
cases give the limits of the middle fifty per cent. When the num- 
ber of cases is such that the upper and lower limits of the middle 
fifty per cent fall between two numbers, the halfway points be- 
tween them are taken as the limits (page 10). 
(4) Bonner’s reports. More recent than the studies that 
have been reviewed, and consequently more useful for 
practical purposes to-day, are three reports issued by the 
National Bureau of Education, prepared by H. C. Bonner, 
collector and compiler of statistics for the bureau. The
-P-A-G-E-96
  82 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
first of these reports was issued in 1920 under the title, 
Statistics of the State School Systems, 1917-18. In it are 
presented, for each of the individual States and for the 
Nation as a whole, the following financial comparisons: (1) 
average annual cost per pupil enrolled for current expenses 
and capital outlays; (2) average annual and daily costs per 
pupil in daily attendance for the same objects of expendi- 
ture; and (3) the amount spent for schools for each one 
hundred dollars of taxable wealth. 
The second report appeared in 1920 also, bearing the 
title, Statistics of City School Systems, 1917-18.2_ Here “an 
attempt has been made for the first time to secure statistics 
from all cities which had a population of 2500 or over in 
1910.” The cities reported upon are grouped in five popula- 
tion groups, forty-five cities to the group, as follows: cities 
of 100,000 or more population, cities of from 30,000 to 100,- 
000, cities of from 10,000 to 30,000, cities of from 5000 to 
10,000, and cities of from 2500 to 5000 population. Com- 
parative costs per student in average daily attendance are 
given for main budgetary expenditures (general control, 
instruction, operation of plant, maintenance of plant, aux- 
iliary agencies, and fixed charges), and for different types of 
schools (elementary and kindergarten, secondary, and vo- 
cational, normal, and special schools). The results of this 
study are especially important because of the number of 
cities which are included, because of the many sizes of cities 
represented, and because the facts are relatively recent. A 
summary of the more important results will be presented 
later in this chapter. / 
The third report bears the same title as the second, but 
applies to the period 1919-20.3 The facts presented are 
thus still more recent than those of the second report. For

-P-A-G-E-97
  COMPARATIVE COSTS IN EDUCATION 83 
this reason they are more valuable. But the third report 
comprises fewer cities, and the analysis of expenditures is 
less complete. In these ways it is inferior. 
Other studies. It is impossible to do more than mention 
the general groups into which fall the remaining numerous 
studies of comparative school costs. Most common, per- 
haps, in the recent literature, are the financial portions of the 
city school surveys. Especially good examples of this group 
are found in the Cleveland, Grand Rapids, Philadelphia, 
and St. Louis survey reports. Another group comprises 
several university and college bulletins. As an example, 
Monroe’s study (see reference 13) of high-school costs in 
Kansas may be mentioned. A third group comprises the 
financial sections of the annual reports of city superintend- 
ents. Of these, Superintendent Spaulding’s Newton, Mas- 
sachusetts, reports are important historical examples. Yet 
a fourth group has appeared in the periodical literature. The 
more important of these studies are included in the bib- 
liography appended to this chapter. 
There have recently come from the press several volumes 
of the report of the Educational Finance Inquiry Commis- 
sion which bear directly upon the matter of unit costs. Two 
of these volumes (see references 10 and 20) deal with school 
costs in New York State, and a third (see reference 8) with 
school costs in Illinois. The important conclusions arrived 
at in these studies will be given in their appropriate connec- 
tions farther along in this chapter. 
We must now adopt a different plan for summarizing this 
voluminous literature. In the next section will be listed the 
principal problems set up in these studies of comparative 
costs. Succeeding sections will review the methods and 
more important results of the attacks upon these various 
problems. 
1 These statistical summaries, for both States and cities, are now being 
issued in a regular biennial series by the U.S. Bureau of Education.
-P-A-G-E-98
  84 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
Classification of the problems. The more important 
problems raised in these studies of comparative school costs 
are as follows: 
(1) It is sometimes asked: How does a given community 
compare with other similar communities in its ability to 
finance a program of education? This question is usually 
answered upon the basis of comparative wealth in relation 
to school and city population, scholastic population, and 
school enrollment or attendance. This problem is coming 
to be characteristic of the school surveys. 
(2) Another frequent question in the surveys is: How do 
the expenditures for education in a given community com- 
pare with the same community’s expenditures for other 
kinds of public service? With this question is frequently 
associated another: How does the proportion given to edu- 
cation in the selected place compare with the proportion 
assigned to education in other comparable places? 
(3) How does the total expenditure for education in a 
given community compare with the same type of expendi- 
ture in other comparable places? Here expenditures are 
commonly reduced to unit bases, in terms of population, 
wealth, and school attendance. This problem is frequent in 
the surveys. 
(4) How do the proportionate expenditures for general 
control, instruction, operation and maintenance of plant, 
auxiliary agencies, and fixed charges in one school system 
compare with the proportionate expenditures for the same 
items in other comparable systems? This problem is dis- 
cussed in the surveys, in school reports, and in the periodical 
literature. 
(5) How do the costs of different types of schools (ele- 
mentary schools, secondary schools, etc.), or of different 
subjects of instruction (high-school English, mathematics, 
languages, sciences, shop-work, etc.), in one school or school
-P-A-G-E-99
  COMPARATIVE COSTS IN EDUCATION 85 
system compare with the costs of similar items in other 
schools or school systems? Studies of this question, or of 
some phase of it, make up a large part of the material found 
in the periodical literature. : 
(6) What are the norms or standards of expenditure as 
indicated by the practices of cities or communities studied 
in connection with any of the foregoing problems? 
(7) What are the tendencies revealed in any of the pre- 
ceding types of comparison when traced over a period of 
years? 
(8) What causes are responsible for the facts found in any 
of the foregoing studies? 
Most, although not all, of the unit-cost studies reported 
in the educational literature can be classified under one or 
more of the above types with respect to their problems. 
Not infrequently a study will involve more than one of 
these problems. This is especially true of the financial in- 
vestigations undertaken in the school surveys. Neverthe- 
less, the classification given is a useful one as a basis for 
summarizing results and methods. For greater brevity of 
treatment, however, these studies will be grouped in this 
chapter under three main heads, as follows: 
First, studies concerned with a community’s ability and 
effort to maintain its schools. 
Second, studies concerned with the distribution of ex- 
penditures among the leading items of the budget. 
Third, studies concerned with the relative costs of school 
grades, school subjects, and types of schools. 
1. Studies of ability and effort 
Typical studies. This type of study is found chiefly in the 
reports of surveys of city school systems. Among the more 
important are the financial sections of the Cleveland, Grand 
Rapids, Philadelphia, and St. Louis surveys. Less recent 
 
-P-A-G-E-100

86 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
examples are portions of the Updegraff study and the Elliott 
study cited in previous paragraphs. These earlier studies 
are more comprehensive in their scope than are the surveys, 
but are too old to be very useful at the present time. As 
examples of method they are still valuable, however. 
Typical problems. Ideally, it would seem wise to separate 
the attack upon a city’s ability to maintain schools from the 
attack upon its actual effort to do so. Ability can be got at 
by comparing a city’s wealth per inhabitant, per scholastic, 
and per pupil in school with similar units of wealth in other 
comparable cities. Of these units, possibly wealth per 
scholastic is the most significant. A city’s effort can be 
measured by a study of its total school expenditures as com- 
pared with those of other cities, in relation to other city ex- 
penditures and to the numbers of children in the schools. 
In practice, however, the attacks upon these different 
problems often are not separated. Both ability and effort 
are frequently involved in the questions raised in the city 
school surveys. ‘The most important of these questions are 
here listed. 
(1) In the history of the city’s financing of its schools, 
what relation exists between increases in expenditures and 
growth of income? If income is not keeping pace with ex- 
penditures, it is inferred that the city is approaching the 
limit of its ability to sustain schools. 
(2) How does the city rank among other comparable 
cities in wealth, real or assessed, per inhabitant? This ques- 
tion is also a rough approach to the problem of ability. 
(3) How does the city rank among other comparable cit- 
ies in expenditures for school purposes (a) per inhabitant, 
(b) per pupil enrolled or in average daily attendance, (c) per 
$1,000 of wealth, real or assessed? In (b) we have a direct 
1 The word “State” should be substituted for the word “city,” in all of 
these questions, when reference is made to the State school surveys.
-P-A-G-E-101
COMPARATIVE COSTS IN EDUCATION 87 
attack upon the problem of effort; in (a) and (c) the pro- 
blems of ability and effort are combined in the question 
raised. 
(4) How does the city rank among other comparable cities 
in the proportion of the total municipal expenditures that 
goes for schools? Frequently this question is so handled that 
the proportionate expenditures for all municipal activities 
are compared for the cities treated. This question shows 
the influence of Elliott’s early study persisting in the modern 
school surveys. In a sense, it is a measure of the effort put 
forth to maintain schools, but it also involves the ele- 
ment of ability. 
Some examples. It is impossible here to do more than 
present a few examples of the numerous attacks, and kinds 
of attack, upon these problems. The examples given have 
been selected because of their simplicity, and also because 
they illustrate successfully the methods usually employed. 
The first example is presented in Table I. ‘This table 
shows the ranking of St. Louis, in a group of twenty-two 
comparable cities, in wealth per inhabitant lying back of 
the schools. The assumption plainly is that the school 
burden of a city is proportional to its total population. 
This is true only to the extent that school population is 
proportional to total population in the different cities. A 
better measure would be the wealth per census child, be- 
cattse the school census is a better index than either the total 
census or the school enrollment of what a city’s educational 
burden ought tobe. But “wealth per inhabitant” is a fairly

from the census of 1910. The source of the financial data 
is shown in the table. The “real” wealth represents a com- 
putation from the assessed wealth of each city and its stated 
rate of assessment. When the real wealth per inhabitant 
for each city had been obtained, the cities were ranked in 
order from highest to lowest according to this amount.

San Francisco, having the greatest wealth per unit, was 
ranked first; New Orleans, with the least wealth per unit, 
was ranked last. In this series, St. Louis ranks sixth. 
This ranking method is satisfactory where there are so few 
cities to be compared. The method of determining a city’s 
position in a large number of cities is illustrated in Table III.

sources of the data for this table, and the method of its deri- 
vation and presentation, are similar to those of Table I. In 
this series Grand Rapids is seen to rank sixth. 
Table III shows the comparative emphasis given to educa- 
tion, in terms of the percentage of total city expenditures 
devoted to that purpose, in more than two hundred Ameri- 
can cities. Data are presented for three consecutive years 
— 1917, 1918,and1919. It is thus possible to trace changes 
in this emphasis from year to year. Turning to the last 
column, we observe that in 1919 one city gave between 15 
and 19.9 per cent of its total expenditures to its schools, 
while another city, at the opposite extreme, gave between 
60 and 64.9 per cent. The median city gave 38.7 per cent of

  COMPARATIVE COSTS IN EDUCATION 91 
its total expenditures to education. The “middle fifty per 
cent” ranged between 31.2 per cent and 45.7 per cent — the 
limits of the “25 percentiles,” respectively. Philadelphia, 
with only 21.8 per cent of its total municipal expenditures 
devoted to education, ranked not only below the median, 
but even outside the “zone of safety” (to borrow Bobbitt’s 
phrase) represented by the middle half. The indication is 
that Philadelphia should either discover a satisfactory ex- 
planation for this discrepancy, or devote a larger share of 
its revenues to education. 
Selecting comparable cities. The basic method in the 
studies of this group is that of comparing the city which is 
the immediate object of attention with other cities. The 
validity of this method hinges upon securing for the com- 
parison cities which are really comparable. The difficulty 
of this problem, and the principles used in solving it, appear 
in the quotations which follow.! 
The determination of the sufficiency or insufficiency of school 
expenditure is made difficult by the absence of a recognized stand- 
ard of educational cost. Students of educational administration 
have never agreed, nor in view of the complexity of the question 
would it be easy for them to agree, as to how much a city should 
spend for schools for each person in the population, per $1000 of 
wealth, per child of school age, or per child attending school. In 
the absence of such a definite standard a city’s expenditure for 
school purposes may best be measured and evaluated by compar- 
ing it with the expenditures of other cities. This does not mean 
that the expenditure of any city, or the average expenditure of a 
group of cities, represents the ideal. It means rather that, as 
cities are working toward a common end, in the face of common 
difficulties and obstacles, the average achievement of a group 
represents the average attainable ideal for American cities. The 
prevailing practice is not the goal toward which educators are 
working, but a compromise between what is thought to be desira-

ble and what is found to be possible. It serves as a convenient 
scale by which to measure achievement. 
As the educational problems of a large city differ from those of a 
smaller town or city, it is important, in comparing city expendi- 
tures, to deal only with cities of approximately the same size.... 
A small and poor city cannot spend as much money for schools as 
can a large and wealthy city; nor is it needful that a city having a 
small number of children to educate should spend as much as a city 
having a large number of children. If comparisons of educational 
expenditures are to yield significant results, differences in the re- 
sources and educational needs of the cities compared must be con- 
sidered and allowed for. A city’s resources determine what it is able 
to spend for school purposes; its educational needs determine what 
it should spend. The amount spent, considered in relation to re- 
sources, reflects the community’s generosity — the value which its 
citizens place on education; the amount spent, considered in rela- 
tion to educational needs, indicates the character of the tools and 
supplies with which the educational authorities are asked to ac- 
complish a given amount of work. 
The following from Rugg! further illustrates the 
difficulty: 
We have no definite ideal standards by which we can enswer the 
question: “How much money should a city raise for school pur- 
poses?” We can, however, state the degree to which a city con- 
forms to or betters the common practice of the day. We can 
legitimately compare the practice of a city in any aspect of the ad- 
ministration of its schools with other cities having the same finan- 
cial status. ... 
No entirely satisfactory basis has as yet been worked out for the 
grouping of cities for comparative purposes. It has been agreed 
that comparisons should be made only of cities of roughly the same 
size. It is a well-recognized fact, however, that cities of the same 
size vary widely in their wealth, distribution of their population by 
nationality and by occupations, prevalent wage scales, rapidity in 
growth of the number of children of school census age, proportion 
of the school population in parochial schools, ete. 
  
1 Rugg, H. O., in School Survey, Grand Rapids, Michigan (1916), pp. 373- 
74.
-P-A-G-E-107
  COMPARATIVE COSTS IN EDUCATION 93 
An ideal list with which to compare the financial situation in 
Grand Rapids could best be made up by taking account of all of the 
above factors. To do so, however, would reduce the size of the 
group to such an extent that it would be of little value for practical 
purposes. In selecting the cities used in this report, three criteria 
were followed: (1) the cities must be roughly of the same size; (2) 
they must have approximately the same wealth per person in the 
population; (3) they must have roughly the same wealth per school 
census child. It is thus believed that the most adequate single 
basis for comparing school finance in cities is the per capita amount 
of money available for school purposes. 
In another place Rugg also says: ! 
Cities to be used for comparative purposes could best be selected 
on the basis of at least 4 criteria: (1) they should be of roughly the 
same population; (2) they should have somewhat the same geo- 
graphical location in the country; (3) they should have approxi- 
mately the same wealth per inhabitant or school census child; (4) 
they should have roughly the same types of population from the 
racial and occupational standpoints. Moreover, since the list is 
going to be used for purposes of “ranking” the cities in serial 
order, it should be reasonably long, say generally not less than 
fifteen to twenty cities. 
How to use these studies. Most of these studies of effort 
and ability do not present norms of procedure which have 
very general usefulness for school superintendents who de- 
sire to analyze their local situations. Occasionally, a super- 
intendent will find a report the data of which are sufficiently 
recent, and the cities in which are sufficiently comparable to 
his own, to make possible a direct comparison between the 
facts of ability and effort in his own city and the facts set 
forth in the study. As a general thing, however, these 
studies are valuable chiefly as demonstrations of method. 
A superintendent desiring to compare his local situation

with situations in other comparable places must first deter- 
mine just what comparisons will be most useful for his pur- 
pose. These studies of ability and effort will help him here. 
Then he must select for himself a group of comparable 
places. The bases for making these selections are set forth 
in the immediately preceding section. Then he must collect, 
for each of these places and for his own, the data that will 
be needed for the comparisons proposed. Much of this data 
can usually be secured from State reports, national reports, 
etc. Often much of it will have to be collected more directly 
through correspondence with the authorities in each of the 
cities. When the data have been secured, the facts can be 
analyzed and compiled according to the methods illustrated 
above. 
2. Studies of budgetary apportionments 
Typical studies and problems. Studies dealing with budg- 
etary apportionments are even more numerous than those 
dealing with financial ability and effort. They are a con- 
tinuation of the line of investigation initiated by Strayer in 
1905. They form a conspicuous part of the financial phase 
of the surveys, comprise much of the financial literature in 
the educational magazines, and form the central portions 
of the reports of the national Bureau of Education. Of 
especial importance are the Strayer study, the Updegraff 
study, Bonner’s first report on Statistics of City School 
Systems, and a publication issued by the National Chamber 
of Commerce entitled, Know and Help Your Schools. 
In nearly all of the studies of this group, expenditures for 
current expenses only, as distinguished from capital outlays, 
are considered. In the survey studies the main problem 
has been to compare the distribution of these current ex- 
penditures among the various budgetary items in the city 
under survey with like distributions in other cities of the  
-P-A-G-E-109
  COMPARATIVE COSTS IN EDUCATION 95 
same class. The results are interpreted only in terms of 
the selected city. Little or no attempt is made to set up 
norms. But in the studies that have been named above the 
problem is more comprehensive; i.e., to determine the norms 
of expenditure, in terms of per cents and per pupil costs, in 
the various departments of the budget. Strayer and Upde- 
graff compiled their studies before these budgetary depart- 
ments had been standardized. Their studies are thus less 
significant than the later ones. Of all of the studies of 
budgetary appropriations, perhaps the reports of Bonner 
on city schools are to-day most valuable. 
Definition of terms. Bonner’s reports divide current ex- 
penditures among these main items: general control, in- 
struction, operation of plant, maintenance, auxiliary agen- 
cies and fixed charges. These terms are described as follows:1 
The cost of general control includes all administration costs, such 
as salaries and expenses of members of the board of education, 
business agents, and superintendents. The cost of instruction in- 
cludes the salaries and expenses of principals, supervisors, and 
teachers, the cost of textbooks, and the cost of supplies used in in- 
struction. Under operation of plant are placed the wages of jani- 
tors, firemen, and engineers; the cost of fuel, water, power, and 
light; and the cost of supplies used in keeping the school plant fit 
for occupancy. Maintenance costs represent expenditures for 
repair work and for replacing outworn furniture, apparatus, etc. 
Auziliary agencies embrace expenditures for libraries, health, recre- 
ation, school lunches, lecture courses, ete. Fixed charges and 
interest include contributions, rents, insurance costs, and the 
amount paid out as interest on the school debt. 
Norms for size of city. The expenditure distribution norms 
presented in this section are derived from Bonner’s two re- 
ports on the statistics of city school systems. Table IV is 
compiled from his Table 59, in the report for 1917-18; Tables 
V and VI are from his Table 4, in the report for 1919-20.

lows: Group I, cities of 100,000 or more; Group II, cities of 
between 30,000 and 100,000; Group III, cities of between 
10,000 and’ 30,000; Group IV, cities of between 5000 and 
10,000; and Group V, cities of between 2500 and 5000. A 
total of two hundred and twenty-five cities are included; 
there being forty-five in each of the five groups. This table 
shows the expenditures, per pupil in average daily attend- 
ance, for each budgetary item, in each group of cities; the 
presentation being in terms of the total range, the middle 
fifty per cent, the median, and the average. 
The range for each group is represented by the expenditure 
of the lowest city and by that of the highest city — the one 
spending the least and the one spending the most — for 
each budgetary item. The middle fifty per cent and the 
median are here used, as defined by Updegraff in our earlier 
quotation. The average is the ordinary arithmetical average, 
technically known as the mean, and is the measure used by 
Bonner himself as the expression of the norm. With the 
exception of the averages, all of the measures presented in 
this and other tables in this section have been worked out 
from Bonner’s tables by the writer. 
Inspection of the “median” and “average” columns of 
this table reveals an interesting tendency. There is a 
steady decline in the total current expenditures per pupil 
as one goes from the larger-city to the smaller-city groups. 
The same tendency is evident in the per capita expenditures 
for instruction and for maintenance of plant. The other 
expenditures seem to be less regularly affected by the size 
of the cities concerned. According to this table, the larger 
the city the greater tend to be the per pupil expenditures for 
maintenance, for instruction, and for total current costs. 
As norms for use in judging of the expenditures of other 
comparable cities, the most significant measures are the 
limits of the “middle fifty per cents.” Within these limits
-P-A-G-E-112
  98 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
lie what Bobbitt has suggestively called the “zone of safety.” 
It is with these measures especially that a superintendent is 
advised to compare the per pupil distribution of expenditures 
in his own city; selecting for the purpose those of the popula- 
tion group to which his city belongs. If his own figures are 
within these limits, well and good; if not, let him study his 
situation in search of an acceptable explanation.

years. The medians and averages here show a less regular 
but still noticeable decline from the larger to the smaller 
cities, in total current expenditures and in costs of instruc-

difference is the general increase in all lines of expenditure

age norms are regarded by many as more desirable for com- 
parative purposes than are norms of absolute expenditures 
such as appear in the preceding tables. Before using them, 
however, a superintendent should make sure that his total 
current expenditures are not unreasonably high or low. 
Regional norms for cities. Another interesting series of 
norms is presented in Tables VII and VIII. ‘These tables 
are concerned with the regional location of cities above ten 
thousand population, without reference to their size.1_ The 
different regional groups embrace the indicated number of 
cities, situated in the indicated States. 
Western: Twenty-three cities, in Arizona, California, Colorado, 
Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washing- 
ton, and Wyoming. 
North Central: Forty-five cities in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kan- 
sas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North 
Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. 
Eastern: Forty-six cities in Connecticut, Delaware, District of 
Columbia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, 
New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, 
Virginia, and West Virginia. 
Southern: Twenty-one cities in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, 
Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South 
Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. 
Table VII presents the data for these several groups of 
cities in terms of per pupil costs. Table VIII presents 
similar data in percentage terms. The “median” and 
“average” columns of both tables show the relations of the 
central tendencies of the several groups. Inspection of the 
median column of Table VII shows that the order of the 
groups from highest to lowest in total per pupil current ex- 
penditures is Western, North Central, Eastern, and South- 
ern. Western cities spend most, and Southern cities least, 
per pupil for current expenses. The same order appears

North Central cities outrank the Western cities when com- 
pared by medians. The “average” column shows the same

the Western group.

The corresponding columns in Table VIII also reveal 
some interesting facts. It appears, for instance, that the 
Southern cities devote a considerably larger proportion of 
their budgets to instruction and general control than do 
other cities, while they fall relatively behind in other ex- 
penditures. The North Central group appears to devote 
the smallest proportionate share to instruction of all the

norms are possibly more valuable than are the per pupil 
norms, being less affected, probably, by the flight of time. 
How to use these studies. It is unfortunate that financial 
figures of so much interest as those quoted in these tables 
should be so far behind the times. School costs change 
swiftly in these post-war days. The changes are possibly 
not uniform in different sections, or even in cities of different 
size. Consequently, neither the per-pupil cost norms nor 
the percentage norms are very reliable for modern use. 
Nevertheless, they are the best, in the sense of being most 
comprehensive, that can now be given. It should also be 
observed that the data here presented are two years later 
than the data contained in the tables immediately preceding. 
In these tables, as in the tables having to do with size of 
city, the chief value consists in the hints that are given as 
to procedure. They indicate the policies of selecting cities 
for comparative purposes upon the bases of regional location 
and comparable size. Of the two, regional location is prob- 
ably the more significant. Inspection of the tables will 
show a wider interval between the medians, and a narrower 
spread between the limits of the middle fifty per cent, in the 
regional groups than in the groups based upon size of city. 
The tables also demonstrate the methods of arranging the 
selected cities for comparative purposes. 
Probably the most useful portions of these tables, to 
school officers who wish to compare their local practices with 
practices elsewhere, are the columns representing the upper 
and lower limits of the “middle fifty per cent.” Within 
these limits lies the zone of safety. After the superintendent 
has determined the per-pupil expenditures, and the per- 
centage of expenditures, for each of the items in his budget, 
tet him compare his figures with these “middle-half” limits 
for cities of the proper size or regional location. If his 
figures lie outside these limits — to-day, in particular, below 
 
-P-A-G-E-118

them — he will doubtless conclude that he faces a problem 
for investigation, if not for administrative change. 
3. Studies of comparative costs of schools, grades, and subjects 
Problems and methods. Other very popular ways of 
grouping school expenditures for comparative purposes are 
according to the types of school involved, or school grades, 
or school subjects. Studies of these sorts also yield results 
of great practical utility. It is as important for a superin- 
tendent to know that he is not developing his high schools at 
the expense of his elementary schools, or some high-school 
subjects at the expense of others, as to know that he is not 
devoting unwarrantable sums to certain items of his budget. 
The favorite problems raised in studies of these sorts have to 
do with the relative costs of instruction in elementary and high 
schools, and with the relative costs of different high-school 
subjects. The studies are thus concerned with the distribu- 
tion of instructional expenditures alone, and do not as a rule 
consider expenditures for other budgetary items. The rela- 
tion of these studies to the studies reviewed in earlier sec- 
tions of this chapter is shown in the accompanying diagram.

COMPARATIVE COSTS IN EDUCATION 105 
The methods employed involve (1) isolating the expendi- 
tures for each type of school, or each grade or subject, and 
(2) reducing these expenditures to some comparative unit 
basis. The units of comparison preferred are the per-pupil 
costs, based at times upon enrollment and at other times 
upon average daily attendance. In comparing secondary 
with elementary school costs, a common method of state- 
ment is in terms of a “ratio” obtained by dividing the sec- 
ondary school costs by the elementary school costs. This 
ratio is used in the next section. 
Mention should be made at this point of the “salary-ratio 
formula” used in the reports of the Educational Finance 
Inquiry Commission. One of the perplexing problems of the 
past in this field has been that of apportioning accurately 
among the different types of schools — elementary, second- 
ary, etc. — the current expenditures for other purposes than 
teaching. Most school financial accounts are too meagre to 
enable one to make this apportionment directly from the 
distribution sheets. The salary-ratio formula, if its con- 
tinued use, in its most general form, bears out its accuracy, 
will be very helpful here. It is stated as follows:! 
The amount of money spent for teachers’ salaries bears a close 
and constant relationship to total current expenses in each division 
of the school system. 
If this statement is correct, it means that the total cur- 
rent cost of any division of a school system will bear the 
same relation to the current cost of the whole system that 
the total salary cost of the division bears to the salary 
cost of the whole system. However far it may fall short 
of absolute accuracy, this procedure is probably the best 
that is available at present.

Elementary vs. high-school costs. Among the many 
available studies here the following may be mentioned: 
Martin ! found the per-pupil costs in six large North- 
eastern cities (New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Cleveland, 
Pittsburgh, and Baltimore) to be: Elementary schools: 
range, $17 to $33; median, $24.50. High schools: range, 
$52 to $71; median, $69.50. Range of ratios, from 2.12 to 
3.06; ratio of medians, 2.83. 
The Philadelphia Survey ? presents data for eight large 
Northeastern cities (Buffalo, Boston, Detroit, Milwaukee, 
Newark, Cleveland, Chicago, and Philadelphia). Com- 
parisons are expressed in terms of costs of each one hundred 
days’ attendance, as follows: Elementary schools: range, 
$21.75 to $50.07; median, $31.85. High schools: range, 
$54.44 to $86.60; median, $67.68. Range of ratios, from 
1.507 to 2.845; ratio of medians, 2.125. 
The Grand Rapids Survey ® gives data for seventeen cities 
of Grand Rapids’s population class, in terms of cost per 
pupil in average daily attendance. The costs were: Ele- 
mentary schools: range, $22.24 to $44.04; median, $31.51. 
High schools: range, $47.27 to $94.74; median, $63.77. 
Ratio of medians, 2.02. 
Giles, ‘ reporting on costs per pupil in twenty-five Indiana 
cities of more than 25,000 population, gives these figures: 
Elementary schools: range, $18.65 to $45.63; median, $26.41. 
High schools: range, $39.28 to $85.70; median, $57.02. 
Ratio of medians, 2.16.

In the main, these tables speak for themselves. Table IX

groups according to elementary-school costs is: Western, 
North-Central, Eastern, and Southern. The Eastern group 
rises above the North-Central group when ranked according 
to high-school costs. 
Table IX yields the following ratios of medians with re-

because kindergarten costs are included with elementary-

regional locations: Western, 2.04; North-Central, 2.02; 
Eastern, 2.19; Southern, 2.17. The average of these ratios 
is 2.10. The excess of high-school over elementary-school

COMPARATIVE COSTS IN EDUCATION 109 
Costs of elementary grades and junior high schools. A 
study of the relative costs of teaching the grades and sub- 
jects in the elementary schools of Hutchinson, Kansas, has 
been published by Superintendent J. O. Hall.! The unit of 
comparison used was the “teacher-minute,” i.e., the cost 
of a minute of instruction per teacher in each grade and in 
each subject. The results show a rather consistent decline 
in the grade costs from the first to the eighth. Among the 
subjects, reading, arithmetic, and language are found to be 
the most expensive, while civics, manual training, domestic 
science, and physical training are among the least expensive. 
These findings in both instances are in interesting contrast to 
findings which will appear below, and are chiefly valuable 
to show the importance of selecting with great care the best 
unit of comparison. 
Strayer and Ha‘g ? report the relative costs of fifth-grade 
subjects in one city in the State of New York. The data 
were secured for the year 1922. The costs per subject were 
as follows: English, $18.46; Arithmetic, $8.79; social studies, 
$9.67; health work, $6.51; fine and practical arts, $9.32; 
general exercises, $5.27. “‘These figures measure in money 
terms the relative weight given to different subjects, and 
to a slight extent the number of children per teacher.” 
In contrast to Hall’s finding that the upper elementary 
grades are the least expensive, Strayer and Haig (p. 55) 
report a decided tendency toward increasing costs in going 
from the lower to the higher grades. Upon this point we may 
also note the following data from the Gary School Survey.

The Grand Rapids survey shows the comparative costs of 
instruction in the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades under 
the old plan, in which the first two of these grades were a 
part of the elementary school and the last a part of the high 
school, and the new plan where all three grades are combined 
into the junior high school. Under the old plan the semester 
costs were: seventh grade, $10.67; eighth grade, $11.86; 
ninth grade, $22.63. The junior high school costs were: 
seventh grade, about $18.00; eighth grade, about $20.00; 
ninth grade, about $20.00. 
Both the Gary and the Grand Rapids figures show that, 
on the per-pupil basis, elementary-school costs tend to in- 
crease from grade to grade. The Grand Rapids figures also 
show that the junior high school organization is more ex- 
pensive than the older type of organization for the seventh 
and eighth grades. This finding is confined in the main by 
Inglis.!_ Seventeen out of thirty cities reporting stated that 
the new type of organization was more expensive than the 
old; seven had found it no more expensive. Twenty of these 
thirty cities had found the junior high school less expensive 
than the senior high school, while ten had found it quite as 
costly. The bulk of the evidence seems to show that junior 
high school costs may be expected to fall somewhere between 
the costs of the elementary schools and the senior high 
schools. 
Comparative costs of high-school subjects. Many 
studies have appeared of the relative costs of the different 
subjects taught in high school, and of the causes of the 
differences found. Unfortunately, these studies vary so 
widely and in so many respects that comparisons and sum- 
maries are difficult to make. There is disagreement in the 
mere listing of the subjects for comparative purpcses; the 
sciences, for example, being listed as one subject in some of 
1 Inglis, A.: Principles of Secondary Education (1918), p. 297.
-P-A-G-E-125
  COMPARATIVE COSTS IN EDUCATION 111 
the studies and as several independent subjects in others. 
There is also disagreement as to the unit adopted for pur- 
poses of comparison, and as to the cost factors that are taken 
into account. In these respects, however, the tendencies 
seem to be: (1) to center upon the student-hour unit in 
some form or other, and (2) to base instructional costs upon 
the single item of teachers’ salaries. But departures from 
both of these tendencies are very common. 
Methods. One of the earliest of these studies was made by 
Bobbitt in the course of the San Antonio survey. Some of 
the results of this investigation, together with an analysis of 
method, appeared later in an article that is one of the classics 
in this field (see reference 4 at end of this chapter). This 
study is important not only because it gave larger impetus 
to this type of investigation, but also because it introduced 
two important methods, one of comparison and the other 
of presentation. 
The first was the unit of “1000 student-hours.” The 
student-hour unit is now recognized as about the only legiti- 
mate one for use in these studies, and its multiplication by 
1000 gives a product in terms of dollars rather than in terms 
of a decimal of a cent. Such a unit makes the comparisons 
more meaningful and emphatic. 
The second, the method of presentation, was called the 
“zone of safety.” This is only a different name for the 
“middle fifty per cent” already described in these pages as 
the natural accompaniment of the median in representing a 
ranked series of measurements. This zone of safety may be 
got at in two ways. First, one may determine the zone of 
safety for each school subject, in terms of tue upper and 
lower limits of the middle half when the cities teaching that 
subject had been arranged according to their per-pupil costs 
in that subject. Second, the different subjects may be 
ranked in order from the most to the least expensive as in-
-P-A-G-E-126
112 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
dicated by the medians, and the middle half of these sub- 
jects may be set off between horizontal lines. One of these 
lines will lie at the “upper quartile” point, and the other at 
the “lower quartile” point in the series. Certain subjects 
— usually shop-work, normal training, and Latin — will 
lie above this zone of safety; and other subjects — music, 
agriculture, and English — as a rule lie below it. These 
subjects, therefore, will invite investigation and possible 
administrative adjustments. 
One difficulty generally encountered in finding the 
student-hour unit-cost of instruction in any subject is that 
of determining the exact total cost of that subject in the 
high school. The actual teaching cost can be fairly readily 
ascertained when the salary and teaching program of each 
teacher is known. A minor difficulty here is met when, as in 
the case of a teaching-principal, a portion of the salary must 
be charged to functions other than instruction. The main 
problem, though, is to determine the costs, other than the 
salary of teachers, that should be charged against a given 
subject. In rare cases the financial accounts of a school may 
be so distributed that a fair estimate of these extra-teaching 
eee can be obtained. Usually, however, one of two things 
/ must be done; either the actual teaching cost alone must be 
/ considered, on the ground that other costs will be roughly 
/ proportional to this, or the other costs must be distributed 
| among the various subjects in proportion to the pupil-enroll- 
_ ment. The second of these procedures seems to be the more 
‘\common at present. The total cost, or the teaching cost, 
of a subject having been determined, the final step in the 
direction of student-hour costs is taken by dividing this cost 
by the total class-enrollment in that subject. Here, differ- 
ences in the length of class periods must be taken into ac- 
count.

the subject-matter costs found in all of the many studies 
that have been made in this field. These costs vary greatly 
with time and place. In Tables XI, XII, and XIII are 
presented the results arrived at in three recent studies, made 
in three widely separated States. There are at least three 
factors present here, however, which affect the comparability 
of the data. First is the geographical location of the States 
— New York in the East, Illinois in the North-Central por- 
tion, and Texas in the Southwest. Second is the difference 
in time — New York data being for the school year 1921-22,

p. 58. Reprinted by permission of The iiacmillan Company, publishers. 
The high schools were: Peoria (2 schools), Rockford, Springfield, Bloomington, Jackson- 
ville, Kewanee, and Canton, 
the Illinois data for 1922-23 (apparently), and the Texas 
data for 1923-24. The third differential is found in the 
units of comparison used in the several studies. The New 
York study used pupil-hour cost for salaries only; the 
Illinois study used the same unit for all ascertainable ex- 
penditures; and the Texas study is in terms of costs per 
student credit-hour. About the only direct comparisons 
that can be made between these tables will have to do with 
the relative costliness of the different subjects. 
Table XIV comprises a survey of the cost-rankings of the 
different high-school subjects as found in several of the 
studies of this problem, other than those whose results have 
just been presented. This table is not entirely satisfactory, 
chiefly because there is so much overlapping in the listing of 
the subjects. This defect is unavoidable, however, because 
the studies do not always designate the subjects in the same

way, but the table suffices, in spite of this defect, to reveal 
important tendencies. Among them are these: 
Normal training, manual training, and the ancient lan- 
guages are, as a rule, among the most expensive subjects 
taught in the high school. 
Mathematics, history, English, domestic science, the 
modern foreign languages, and music are among the least 
expensive subjects, generally speaking. 
Science, agriculture, and the commercial subjects are, as a 
rule, neither unusually costly nor conspicuously cheap. 
Factors in cost differences. An effort was made by 
Wheat ! to determine the causes which produce these differ- 
ences in subject-costs. He found that length of recitation 
was a negligible factor in determining the costs of instruc- 
tion, and that the salaries paid to teachers were not a reliable 
index. In schools enrolling under about a hundred pupils, 
the size of the enrollment seemed to be rather consistently 
related to subject-costs. But the most influential and con- 
sistent factor was that of size of class. 
In his study of subject-matter costs in Texas high schools 
in 1923-24, Evans ? showed the following factors to be most 
important: size of high school, size of classes, lengthened 
periods for laboratory work in science courses, higher sala- 
ries paid vocational teachers because of Smith-Hughes sub- 
ventions, and the high-school year in which the course is 
given. Of these, class-enrollments and teachers’ salaries 
are fundamental. ‘The salaries paid to teachers, however, 
showed a less consistent correlation with cost variations 
than did the size of classes. Both of these factors entered 
into the relationship found to exist between size of high 
school and instructional costs. In the smaller high schools,

small classes make for larger costs; while the larger salaries 
paid in the large high schools, together with a certain stand- 
ardization in size of classes above a certain number, also 
tends to make for increased costs. 
How to use this group of studies. In this section of this 
chapter we have dealt with the relative costs of elementary 
and high schools, of elementary grades and subjects, of the 
upper elementary grades in contrast with the junior high 
school, and of the different high-school subjects. 
Perhaps the greatest value of these studies, to the practical 
school-man, lies in the suggestions contained in them of 
lines of investigation which he may carry on for himself. 
Of all the many sorts of cost studies that a superintendent 
can make, given the time and inclination, it is doubtful if 
any will afford results of more practical helpfulness than will 
studies of the types listed here. These studies are also very 
useful as guides to procedure in the making of similar studies 
in local schools. They indicate the kinds of data to be 
assembled, the units of comparison to be used, the methods 
of making and setting forth comparisons, and the ways of 
interpreting the results. The bases used in selecting cities, 
for cost studies that involve comparisons with other places, 
are also indicated. 
To a limited degree, also, the results of these studies can 
be used by a superintendent as norms or standards with 
which to compare, and by which to evaluate, his findings as 
to like costs in his own school system. They could render 
this service much more effectively if it were possible to keep 
them up-to-date. But even as they stand, they give at 
least an approximation to the conditions that a superintend- 
ent should expect to find. When conspicuous differences 
are found in the costs in local systems, careful study should 
be made to determine if they are due to local differences or 
to temporal changes, or to some form of maladministration.
-P-A-G-E-134
  120 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
In general, it is recommended that the superintendent 
endeavor to develop norms or standards for himself. If he 
wishes to know if his distribution of expenditures between 
his elementary and high schools is a normal one, let him 
collect very recent data about such costs in schools close to 
and like his own. If he wishes to judge of the relative costs 
of subjects in his high school, let him collect the most recent 
data possible on this matter from other comparable high 
schools. Then let him work over these data, and'the cor- 
responding data for his own school or system, and interpret 
their results in the light of the studies here summarized. 
Such a procedure will not only enable him to utilize up-to- 
date norms, but will also permit of comparisons with condi- 
tions in schools which face problems similar to those en- 
countered by himself. 
Chapter summary. In this chapter we have reviewed 
some of the more important studies of school costs. These 
studies represent an effort to apply to education the meth- 
ods of cost-accounting which have already been long familiar 
to the business world. The purpose of the studies has been 
to evolve norms or standards of expenditure whith would be 
comparable in use to norms of accomplishment in subject- 
matter lines derived from educational measurements. In 
this review, special attention has been given to the search 
for norms along the following lines: 
1. The amount of total school expenditures per inhabitant, per 
pupil, and per unit of wealth. 
2. The proportion of the public budget to be devoted to education. 
8. The per-pupil expenditures, and the proportions of the educa- 
tional budget, for general control, instruction, operation and 
maintenance of plant, auxiliary agencies, and fixed charges. 
4. The per-pupil expenditures, and the proportions of the in- 
structional costs, for elementary and high schools, and for the 
different school grades and high-school subjects. 
&. In connection with 3 and 4 above, the variations in norms due 
to the factors of size of city and regional location.
-P-A-G-E-135
COMPARATIVE COSTS IN EDUCATION 121 
In all of the discussion of expenditure norms, however, the 
point has been reiterated that the methods utilized in the 
derivation of these norms are of greater practical importance 
| than are the norms themselves. The norms will change 
more or less from year to year, as economic conditions 
fluctuate. The important asset to the practical school-man 
is an ability to work out for himself standards of expenditure 
which are appropriate to his time and place. 
Also, there has been emphasized in all of this discussion 
the fact that correspondence with these or other expenditure 
norms is not to be insisted upon as a sign of efficiency in any 
individual school system. Wide divergencies from accepted 
standards will generally suggest the possibility of question- 
able practices. But the wisdom of any unusual type or 
amount of educational expenditure can finally be determined 
only in the light of the needs and abilities of the individual 
school. 
Perhaps the most important general implication residing 
in these various studies of unit-costs in schools is the neces- 
sity of having a properly standardized plan for educational 
financial accounting. In the absence of such a system in 
every school organization there can be no norms or stand- 
ards of expenditure established, and there can be no evalua- 
tion of individual schools. Just as efficient budget-making 
has been shown to depend upon studies of unit-costs, so 
unit-cost studies are impossible in the absence of a well- 
planned and well-nigh universal system of financial book- 
keeping. The requirements of such a system will form the 
theme of the next chapter. 
TOPICS FOR INVESTIGATION AND DISCUSSION 
This chapter has raised more questions and opened up more lines of in- 
vestigation than all of the remaining chapters put together. In fact, the 
aim of the chapter has been to introduce the student to the literature on 
standardized school finance investigations. This literature is especially '

prolific of problems of interest to active superintendents in the field. But 
these problems have been suggested in the text in appropriate connections, 
and need not be repeated at this point.

CHAPTER V 
FINANCIAL RECORDS AND ACCOUNTS 
Purpose of this chapter. The two preceding chapters have 
pointed definitely toward the need for adequate methods of 
financial accounting in the public schools. One of the main 
sources of information for intelligent budget-making, it was 
noted, is to be found in the records of previous financial 
transactions. It has also appeared that the very possibility 
of studying educational expenditures in terms of unit-costs 
—an activity likewise necessary for intelligent budget- 
making — depends upon the existence of an accurate, com- 
plete, and well-organized record showing in detail just what 
those expenditures have been. In presenting in this chapter 
a résumé of the characteristics, and a few examples, of an ac- 
ceptable accounting system, we are therefore only carrying 
forward a line of discussion that has already been started. 
The treatment here offered is frankly non-technical, and 
is intended to be of service to the amateur type of financial 
bookkeeper usually found in our schools. Upon its higher 
planes, financial accounting has become a highly specialized 
vocation. A thorough discussion of the subject in even its 
educational applications would require the liberal space of 
an entire volume. It could be written only by an expert 
accountant, and could probably be read understandingly 
only by similar folk. But the financial records of most 
school systems to-day are kept by the superintendent him- 
self, or by a relatively unskilled helper working under his 
supervision. In either case the technical efficiency of the 
work is limited by the meagre acquaintance of most super- 
intendents with modern accounting methods. Such a non- 
technical approach to the subject as is undertaken in this
-P-A-G-E-140
126 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
chapter seems, therefore, not wholly inappropriate or un- 
warranted. i 
The chapter will embrace the following major topics: 
(1) The deficiencies of contemporary financial accounting 
methods in the schools. 
(2) The objectives, qualities, and essential parts of an 
adequate accounting system. 
(3) Examples of systems that have been proposed by 
qualified experts, or which have been employed successfully 
in the field. 
(4) A summary of the advantages that may be expected to 
follow from the use of up-to-date methods. 
No attempt will be made to evolve and present an original 
accounting system. Our purpose is rather to arouse a 
keener appreciation of the need for improved methods, and 
to offer suggestions that may be helpful in working out an 
adequate plan. 
Deficiencies of current methods. A continuous refrain of 
criticism of contemporary school bookkeeping runs through 
the reports of the students of unit-costs: The deficiencies 
have been such as to render futile the efforts of several 
workers, and to restrict the efforts and threaten the conclu- 
sions of several others. Thus, Hutchinson ! tried to secure 
financial statistics from twenty large eastern cities which 
would enable him to set up definite unit-cost standards along 
a number of lines. He found, however, that the accounting 
deficiencies of these important school systems were such 
that his proposed investigation was impossible. He enu- 
merates the following defects: 
No attempt is made to account for revenue accruing and expense 
incurred for education during any given period, accounts being 
kept so as to show only receipts and expenditures, . . . 
There is no attempt to distinguish expenditures made to enable 
1 Hutchinson, J. H.: School Costs and School Accounting (1914).   
   
-P-A-G-E-141
  FINANCIAL RECORDS AND ACCOUNTS ~ 127 
education to be carried on with present facilities from expenditures 
made to increase facilities for education, i.e., there is no attempt to 
distinguish expenditures for maintenance from expenditures for 
capital outlay. ... 
No city obtains the total expenditure for each kind of school, so 
that it is impossible to learn the totals expended for high schools, 
for vocational schools, and for evening schools. . . . 
No city obtains the total expended for each character of expendi- 
ture, so that it is impossible to learn the totals spent for administra- 
tion, supervision, instruction, operation, and maintenance... . 
There is no common classification of objects of expenditure, by 
which may be described the expenditures for all schools, for each 
kind of school, and for each character of expenditure. 
These criticisms, it will be noted, are not directed at the 
practices of small, back-country schools where deficiencies 
in: financial accounting might be excusable. They concern 
the schools of twenty well-known cities in what is, educa- 
tionally speaking, perhaps the most advanced section of 
the country. It may be said in extenuation that Hutchin- 
son’s viewpoint is that of an exacting educational investiga- 
tor, and that he is asking of these accounting systems re- 
sults which they were not designed originally to provide. 
This is probably true; but it must be remembered that mod- 
ern requirements in school accounting include those that 
Hutchinson has made. The modern system must meet 
the reasonable needs of the student of school finance as well 
as those of the practical administrator; indeed, the needs of 
the second can be completely supplied only by meeting the 
requirements of the first. Unit-cost studies find their main 
justification in their practical utility. 
If accounting in these large school systems is so unsatis- 
factory, what shall be said of the situation in the towns and 
smaller cities? Smith’s statement,! that ‘“‘the status of 
school accounting in the average small city is chaotic” is not 
1 Smith, H. P., in American School Board Journal, May, 1915, p. 15. 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  128 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
surprising in view of Hutchinson’s findings in the larger 
places. A summary of the complaints set forth by different 
writers indicates a prevalence of such conditions as these: 
Some superintendents keep no accounts whatever of their 
schools’ financial transactions. In such cases a general record of 
expenditures may be kept by some member of the board. 
Where accounts are kept, they are frequently mere day-book 
records, showing only the lump sum of expenditures to date, and 
perhaps the balance on hand or expected from the annual revenues. 
Where ledger records are maintained, the postings are often made 
to pages devoted to persons or concerns with which the school does 
business, rather than to “character” and “object” expenditure 
sheets. 
(The foregoing practices are usually found in schools which make 
no attempt to construct a formal budget. Many budgetless ao 
however, have fairly satisfactory accounting systems.) 
Where ledger postings are made to character and object ex- 
penditure sheets (see below), the terminology or classification of 
the accounts is often peculiar to the school, and is not comparable 
with that found elsewhere. 
Frequently the authorities fail to provide requisitions, and to 
preserve invoices, vouchers, and other original records of financial 
transactions. There is thus no way to audit the correctness of the 
accounts, or even for the authorities to defend their day-book or 
ledger records, when these are questioned. 
Even the better accounting systems usually fail to distinguish 
between disbursements and liabilities. As a result the balance 
sheets show, for the various appropriations, amounts as yet un- 
expended but not amounts pledged. There is thus great danger 
of exceeding appropriations when the end of the fiscal period ap- 
proaches. 
These numerous deficiencies are probably due in large 
measure to the rapid growth of public education on its 
financial side. Until very recently it was possible in most 
schools to serve all necessary ends by the simplest methods. 
Expenditures were relatively small, and the need for a 
scientific analysis of school costs was not yet recognized. 
“
-P-A-G-E-143
  FINANCIAL RECORDS AND ACCOUNTS 129 
There are other reasons for these deficiencies, the main one 
being, perhaps, that superintendents have failed to observe 
the growing importance of financial bookkeeping, and have 
made no special study of it. ‘They have been content to 
carry the old methods on into a new era. Board members 
have also tolerated, in school accounting, methods that they 
probably would not have tolerated in their personal affairs. 
A change in the attitude of board members, however, is 
hardly to be expected until there comes a change in that of 
superintendents. The time is doubtless approaching when 
arudimentary course in financial accounting will be included 
in the preparation of every prospective superintendent. 
Such a course seems indispensable, whether the superintend- 
ent actually keeps the accounts himself, or not. For the 
present, however, we must content ourselves with such pro- 
gress in this matter as the existing personnel is willing to 
make, on its own initiative. 
Functions of financial accounting. A satisfactory system 
of financial accounting in the schools should serve at least 
six different functions. 
(1) It should serve all of the ordinary business purposes 
of financial bookkeeping, such as restricting expenditures 
to income, protecting responsible officers from charges of 
carelessness or peculation, and keeping up with the business 
generally. 
_ (2)'As a detailed financial record of each fiscal period, it 
should provide the information necessary for drafting budg- 
etary plans for each succeeding period. 
(3) By making possible the balancing of expenditures 
against the budgetary appropriations at any time, it should 
reveal unanticipated tendencies in costs, and inspire the 
necessary revisions of the budget. 
(4) The accounting system of any school should make 
possible a comparison of expenditures and costs in that
-P-A-G-E-144
  180° PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
school with expenditures and costs in other schools. It 
should also be such that its data can be used in connection 
with data obtained from other systems, in scientific studies 
of educational expenditures and in efforts to establish ex- 
penditure norms. 
(5) It should be such as to enable the school authorities 
to approach the school community effectively in explanation 
of their stewardship, and in their efforts to secure for the 
schools more generous support. 
(6) Finally, the accounting system should provide, 
readily and accurately, the data necessary for making re- 
ports to central school authorities — county, State, or na- 
tional — according to the prescribed forms for such reports. 
The failure of contemporary school accounting to measure 
up to these ideals is doubtless due to the failure of school 
boards and superintendents always to comprehend these 
several functions. ‘These officers are still accustomed to 
thinking of school accounting as merely a means for striking 
a balance-sheet. Hence the quickest and simplest means to 
that end has seemed to them satisfactory. The insufficiency 
of this conception, and the need for a broader one, has been 
well stated by Peel,! in the following words: 
The old idea that the purpose of accounting was merely to re- 
cord receipts and disbursements in such a manner as to show 
balances of funds on hand, or deficits, is rapidly giving way to the 
higher conception which recognizes that accounting should be the 
sensitive barometer which shows, not only the condition of finances, 
but the sources and classification of revenue, accrued and un- 
accrued, the liabilities incurred in addition to the disbursements 
made, the classification of expenditures by function, character, and 
object, the combining and accumulating of expense items in such a 
manner as to show the actual costs of definite and specific operations. 
Qualities of a good accounting system. There are three 
distinctive qualities which mark a good accounting system 
1 Peel, A. J., in American School Board Journal, February, 1923, p. 37.
-P-A-G-E-145
FINANCIAL RECORDS AND ACCOUNTS 131 
as contrasted with a poor one. The first mark of a satis- 
factory system is its adequacy. By this is meant that it 
must be both complete and accurate. It must provide all 
needed information for school authorities and students of 
educational finance, and every item of this information 
must be reliable. To say that an accounting system is 
adequate is also to say that it functions in all six of the ways 
just enumerated in the preceding section. It provides com- 
plete and accurate statistics about the available income for 
educational purposes, the amount of this income that has 
actually been received from the various sources, the amount 
remaining to be collected, the total payments to date and 
the outstanding encumbrances against the total appropria- 
tions, and all data necessary to determine the comparative 
costs of schools, grades, subjects, and other special depart- 
ments or lines of service. An adequate system will also be 
complete in the sense that it will include all the necessary 
parts described in the next section of this chapter. 
The second mark is simplicity. Says Peel, “The test of a 
good accounting system is whether it combines efficiency 
with simplicity’; and again, “The best accounting system 
ever devised depends in the final analysis on the human 
element if it is to function properly.” It is only necessary 
to recall what has been said about the amateur character of 
most school bookkeeping to appreciate the need for simplic- 
ity in any practical accounting system. This necessity of 
combining simplicity with adequacy makes the production 
of a satisfactory school accounting system a very difficult 
task. 
In the third place, a good system will be standardized. In 
its classification, nomenclature, and definitions it will follow 
accepted practices in the field. The lack of this standardiza- 
tion — or “uniformity,” as it is sometimes called — is re- 
sponsible for most of the criticism of current accounting
-P-A-G-E-146
  132 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
methods by students of educational finance. These students 
have been seriously hampered in their attempts to make 
comparable cost studies by this lack of standardization. 
The call for standardized accounting is not confined to 
these investigators. Leading educational officers, both 
state and national, have pleaded unremittingly for greater 
uniformity in school reports. Thus the Commissioner of 
Education at Washington has written:! 
The best interests of education demand that there should be 
adequate and uniform methods and forms for collecting and re- 
cording statistics of schools of all kinds in all the States, cities, and 
rural districts of the Union. The work of collecting, compiling, 
and interpreting statistics in the Bureau of Education would be 
greatly helped by this. 
The endeavors of the national bureau of education to 
secure the adoption of a standard accounting and reporting 
system have been seconded by several State departments of 
education, which have outlined plans for financial reporting, 
based upon the standard schedule worked out by the joint 
committee described below, and have required that local 
school authorities follow these forms. The result has been 
to enforce the adoption of more or less standardized systems 
of accounting in such States.? 
Perhaps the most important step in this movement to 
standardize accounts was taken in 1912, when a joint com- 
mittee, consisting of representatives of the Department of 
Superintendence of the National Education Association, of 
the National Bureau of Education, of the National Census 
Bureau, and of the Association of School Accounting Of- 
ficers, drafted and published a Set of standard forms for the 
recording and reporting of educational statistics. The

FINANCIAL RECORDS AND ACCOUNTS 133 
financial forms will be presented in a later section of this 
chapter. The many educational interests represented upon 
this joint committee testify to the range of the sentiment for 
a system of standardized accounting, and helped to popu- 
larize the system after it was proposed. Most efforts at 
standardization have been in the direction of adopting, with 
or without adaptations, the accounting system proposed by 
this committee. 
Essential parts of an efficient system. A complete system 
of financial accounting must include adequate records of 
two distinct sets of facts. One of these groups of facts com- 
prises the growing — or declining — assets and liabilities 
of the school system. The accountant here would record 
the values of sites, buildings, and equipment on the side of 
assets; and losses, debts, and depreciations on the side of 
liabilities. The second set of facts has to do with current 
income and expenditures. Financial accounting in schools 
is frequently restricted, both in conception and in practice, 
to this phase of the matter. The record of income is gener- 
ally simple and is classified, like the revenue side of the 
budget, according to the sources from which the money is 
derived. The record of expenditures is more complex, com- 
prising as a rule four essential parts, or types of records, as 
follows: 
(1) Original records are preserved of every transaction 
involving expenditure of funds. These original records are 
almost indispensable when the time comes to audit the 
school accounts. Also, in case the financial reports and re- 
cords of the board or superintendent should ever be chal- 
lenged by political or other enemies, these original docu- 
ments may be decisive in preserving reputations for com- 
petency or integrity. 
(2) Some form of day-book or journal record of receipts 
and expenditures is often useful, to serve on the one hand
-P-A-G-E-148
  134 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
as a guide to the original record files, and on the other as the 
basis from which to post the regular ledger accounts. This 
feature, however, is omitted from some of the bookkeeping 
systems designed for use in relatively small schools. Where 
such is the case, the ledger pages are posted directly from 
the original records of financial transactions. 
(8) The heart of the system is the classified ledger record, 
in which the completed expenditures are regularly posted 
against the budgetary appropriations, in such a way as to 
reveal the amount expended and the amount remaining, of 
each and all budgetary items, at any time. It is this part 
of the accounting system that is referred to in the many 
pleas for greater “uniformity” or better “standardization.” 
(4) The final state of the accounting system is reached in 
the periodical reports, the balance-sheet, and the revenue 
statement, from the accounting officer to the board and other 
school authorities, setting forth the current financial situa- 
tion in the schools. 
In the quotation below, Hutchinson ! approaches this 
same topic from a somewhat different angle. His analysis 
of the accounting system, however, can be readily fitted into 
the analysis just given. The first two of his three “classes 
of facts” represent a division of the original financial records 
called for in the first paragraph above. His third class of 
facts would be presented in our ledger records and summar- 
ized reports. 
In order that it may be used to accomplish the purposes for 
which it exists, accounting must record certain classes of informa- 
tion. The three principal classes of facts are: data describing 
transactions with outsiders to which the organization is a party; 
data describing transactions between various divisions within the 
organization; and data summarizing and relating these transactions. 
That is, in its simplest forms, accounting requires records of orders, 
  
1 Hutchinson. J H.: School Costs and School Accounting, p. 57.
-P-A-G-E-149
  FINANCIAL RECORDS AND ACCOUNTS 135 
receipts, and payments of services and things supplied to the or- 
ganization and by the organization; records of orders and receipts 
of services and things made by one division of the organization upon 
other divisions of the same organization; and records, or better, 
accounts showing the condition of the organization with respect to 
funds appropriated to purchase services and things received and 
supplied, and amounts paid and due. Accounting also makes pro- 
vision for giving summarized information periodically concerning 
the above data. 
Standardized ledger records. As stated above, the call 
for greater uniformity in school accounting has had particu- 
lar reference to the ledger portion of the system. The ledger 
comprises the classified, permanent record of financial trans- 
actions, from which are derived the data required for mak- 
ing cost comparisons and for filling out county and state 
reports. In order that these reports and studies may be 
comparable from school to school, it is necessary that the 
ledger records of the various schools be comparable. 
Considerable progress has recently been made in the 
standardization of these ledger accounts. The movement 
has been to adopt, in whole or in part, the Standard City 
Schedule for Financial Accounting and Reporting, recom- 
mended by the joint committee on uniform records and 
reports which has been described in an earlier section. 
This movement has proceeded in two ways. In some in- 
stances local city school systems have recognized the 
merits of this schedule, and have adopted it voluntarily as 
the basis of their accounting systems. In other cases its 
adoption has resulted from the action, sometimes compulsory 
through legislative enactment, of State departments of 
education. 
The schedule has been presented in two forms; one, com- 
plete, was intended for the larger cities, and another abridged 
schedule was made up for use in smaller places. Because of 
their historical importance, and also because no other plan
-P-A-G-E-150

has been proposed which promises to supersede them, both 
of these schedules are included here.?

Hutchinson’s system of cost-accounting for schools. 
One of the best examples in the literature of a system for 
recording school expenditures, organized along the lines de- 
scribed above, has been proposed by Hutchinson.! The 
purposes of this system, as stated by its author, are: 
1. To provide for every transaction an original document that 
will contain a complete history of the transaction from its 
beginning to its completion. 
2. To make it possible for those in authority to account for funds 
appropriated for school purposes. 
8. To furnish administrative officers such information as will 
enable them to decide whether every service is performed at 
the lowest cost compatible with maximum efficiency. 
The first of these purposes is provided for in five different 
record forms, as follows: 
A supply requisition form, and a work requisition form, 
to be used by school principals or department heads for pre- 
senting statements to the purchasing officer of special sup- 
plies or work needed for their respective departments or 
schools. : 
A purchase order form, to be used by the purchasing 
officer in ordering these goods or services from the vendors 
of the same. 
A purchase order voucher form, supplied to the vendor 
along with the purchase order, to be used in rendering his 
bill. This voucher, when properly filled out and signed by 
the purchasing officer or other designated person, becomes 
an order upon the school treasurer for the payment of the 
bill. 
A pay-roll form, for regular employees of the schools. 
This form serves in lieu of all of the foregoing forms as a 
record of payments for regular personal services. 
The second of the purposes sought by Hutchinson is 
1 Hutchinson, J. H.: School Costs and School Accounting, pp. 96-146.
-P-A-G-E-155
  
FINANCIAL RECORDS AND ACCOUNTS 141 
achieved by means of a series of ledger sheets. These in- 
clude: Expense ledger sheets for each grade and subject, for 
each school, and for general administration; appropriation 
ledger sheet; and a general balance sheet. All of these 
ledger records are concerned with the recording and totaling 
of expenditures in their proper classifications as bases for 
cost studies and for financial reports. 
The third of Hutchinson’s purposes is reached indirectly 
by the ledger records just described, and is more directly 
arrived at by a series of forms for regular financial summa- 
ries and reports. Forms are provided for monthly state- 
ments — of total expenditures, of the distribution of ex- 
penditures, and of unit-costs for each grade, each school, and 
general administrative functions. In order to secure ad- 
ditional related data for studies of cost comparisons, there 
are also provided time sheet records for principals, super- 
visors, and teachers. These time sheets, together with the 
expense ledger sheets, will furnish the information necessary 
for comparing the costs of subjects, grades, and schools. 
When viewed in the light of the essential parts of an ac- 
counting system as outlined in an earlier section of this 
chapter, this plan of Hutchinson shows obvious deficiencies. 
It provides for no adequate records of income, and for no 
record of assets and liabilities. It is almost wholly a system 
for the proper recording of expenditures, but the author’s 
statement of his purpose, already noted, indicates that this 
was his intention. The caution is that the reader should 
not come to regard this plan as representing a complete 
system for financial accounting. 
Peel’s “chart of accounts” for schools. A better bal- 
anced system of school accounts has been proposed by Peel. 
This author has worked out his plan very explicitly and in 
great detail. (See reference 18.) In this treatment we can 
take notice only of his chart of accounts, in which he has 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
142 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
summarized his entire system of ledger records in graphic 
form, showing its various parts and relationships. (See 
chart opposite.) 
The important ledger accounts in Peel’s system are five in 
number. ‘These consist of: (1) the balance-sheet accounts 
showing assets and liabilities; (2) the appropriation accounts 
showing the appropriations against which expenditures are 
to be balanced; (3) the revenue accounts showing revenues 
received and expected; (4) the operating accounts, classify- 
ing the expenditures for balancing against appropriations, 
and distributing the same expenditures for use in studies of 
unit-costs; and (5) fixed charges. In practice, the analysis 
of “operating accounts” shown in the chart may be abridged 
or expanded to suit the desire or convenience of any particu- 
lar school board or superintendent. The deciding factors 
will probably be the importance attached to a knowledge of 
relative costs in the school system, and the ability of the 
accounting staff to perform the necessary labor. The other 
accounts suggested in this plan will furnish sufficient records, 
as arule, for ordinary business and educational requirements. 
This chart of accounts, it will be observed, covers only 
the ledger-record portion of the complete accounting 
system. In his supplementary discussion Peel describes a 
plan of vouchering and voucher-recording which makes pro- 
vision for original transaction-records along the lines laid 
down by Hutchinson. The plan thus includes every phase 
of Hutchinson’s plan, and in addition provides for a record 
of income and of assets and liabilities. 
A simplified small-city plan. Several attempts have been 
made to work out a simplified plan for financial accounting 
in small-city school systems. The need for such a plan 
grows, of course, out of the usual lack of expert accountants 
in such schools. Of the several plans proposed, the one used 
in Newton, Iowa, may be presented as an example.

This plan provides for a system of original transaction 
records in the form of requisition blanks and bill-heads or 
vouchers, and for a much simplified distribution ledger. 
The requisition blanks are distributed “to each officer 
authorized to purchase.” They thus seem to fulfill the 
functions of purchase orders as well as those of requisitions. 
The bill-heads are constructed for the dual purpose of pre- 
senting bills and of vouchering for their payment. On these 
bill-heads spaces are provided for recording the date, the 
voucher number, and the distribution classification of the 
expenditure in the ledger. 
The ledger is ““a bound volume small enough to be locked 
in a fourteen-inch safe.”” The divisions of this ledger were 
determined in the light of three factors — “the lack of a 
full-time secretary or business manager, the reports required 
by the state school laws, and the form of reports recom- 
mended by the National Education Association Committee 
on Uniform Records and Reports.” Four general funds are 
set aside in the budget, and the expenditures against these 
funds are classified in the ledger. The four funds are the 
“teachers’ fund,” the “schoolhouse fund,” the “bond fund,” 
and the “contingent fund.” Each of these funds is sub- 
divided in the ledger sheets. Space also is provided under 
each fund and subdivision for separate distributions for each 
building in the school system. 
The plan seems fairly adequate from the strictly business 
standpoint, but it is limited almost wholly to the expenditure 
side. It does not appear to make a special record of income, 
or of assets and liabilities. Also, even on the side of ex- 
penditures, it is doubtful if the classification provided is 
sufficiently complete to make possible the needed cost com- 
parisons with larger school systems. Its main defense is its 
simplicity, in view of the practical limitations upon financial 
accounting in small city schools.

A State-wide plan of accounting and reporting. Another 
variation reported in the educational literature is illustrated 
by the Pennsylvania State system of financial accounting 
and reporting.1 This system was devised and put into 
operation by the State department of education. It com- 
prises a book of detailed instructions to school secretaries, 
which is appropriate for schools in districts with a popula- 
tion of five thousand or less, and which contains the follow- 
ing forms: 
1. A tax-collector’s account, for recording reports of the tax- 
collector. This supplies a local need in Pennsylvania. 
2. A record of indebtedness, for keeping up with bond issues and 
payments and temporary loans. 
8. A cash account. “The headings in this account correspond 
with the sources from which school districts in Pennsylvania 
receive revenue for the maintenance and operation of their 
schools.” 
4, A voucher register, in which is entered a record of all bills paid, 
under the department of the ledger against which the charge 
is to be made. 
A voucher folder, which is “a device for keeping together 
orders, bills, and canceled warrants, and is used as a guide in 
posting the expenditures against their proper budget headings 
in the ledger.” 
6. The ledger accounts for general control, instruction, auxiliary 
agencies, operation and maintenance of plant, fixed charges, 
debt service, and capital outlay. 
'%. The secretary’s annual report to the State department of 
education. = 
The headings in the accounting system are the same as appear in 
the form prepared by the State Department of Public Instruction 
for the Annual District Report. ...The secretary of the board at 
the close of each year, after his accounts are audited, is only 
required to transfer totals from his accounting book to the report 
forms. The numbers and items in his accounts conform identically 
with the numbers and items on the annual report forms. This not 
only insures accuracy, but saves considerable labor.

ber, 1922, p. 44.

The advantages of a State-wide system such as the one 
described above are obvious. The accounts are complete 
enough for all local needs, and the directions accompanying 
the forms sent out will guide even the novice in bookkeep- 
ing. The data recorded in the several schools over the 
State are strictly comparable. The reports received by the 
State department are likewise strictly comparable. More- 
over, the forms are sufficiently complete, and in sufficient 
accord with the proposals of the National Education Associa- 
tion standardizing committee, to make possible comparisons 
with the financial records of other states which have adopted 
the same proposals. 
Interest and depreciation. Any financial accounting 
system will naturally take account of school expenditures, 
but there are two other factors entering into the actual cost 
of education about the treatment of which there is much 
uncertainty in both practice and theory. These other fac- 
tors are interest and depreciation. 
The problem of interest shows two aspects. ‘There is, 
for one thing, the interest actually paid out by the school on 
the borrowed portion of its investment. Interest of this 
sort is accounted for in the usual financial record. In a 
sense it is a part of the current expense. But there is also 
to be considered the potential interest on all the rest of the 
school investment; income which might have been received 
had the money invested in school property been invested 
differently. By some authorities this is regarded as a cost 
of education as truly as are the regular expenditures. It is 
not recognized, however, in any school accounting system 
that has come to the writer’s notice. 
By depreciation is meant the loss in value of school assets 
due to “physical or functional decay.” Depreciation re- 
sults from a growing inadequacy of the school plant and 
equipment, caused by wear and tear or by obsolescence. 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
  FINANCIAL RECORDS AND ACCOUNTS 147 
Businesses having large investments in real estate usually 
recognize it as a legitimate item in costs. “The Federal 
Trade Commission considers depreciation the most im- 
portant overhead cost.” The rate of depreciation naturally 
varies with the type and use of the equipment. In office 
buildings it is estimated at three per cent annually. It is 
probable that depreciation is more rapid in school buildings 
than in most other types of construction, owing to rapid 
changes in requirements. 
Among accountants it is generally agreed that deprecia- 
tion should be written off annually on buildings and equip- 
ment, and that the proportion to be written off each year, 
based upon original costs, can be determined scientifically. 
Investigation shows, however, that schools do not as a rule 
write off depreciation on their permanent investment, al- 
though the need for doing so seems to be gaining recognition 
among school authorities. 
These matters do not constitute problems merely for the 
accounting system. Similar problems arise with reference 
to the computation of unit-costs. At present the practice 
varies with schools as to the inclusion of interest on indebted- 
ness in unit-cost computations. Some include it, and some 
do not. But interest on unborrowed capital, and deprecia- 
tion, seem seldom if ever to be included in such computa- 
tions.? 
Chapter summary. In Chapter V we have merely carried 
forward the discussion started in the chapters on budget- 
making and unit-costs. These processes were seen to in- 
volve adequate and accurate records of financial activities, 
particularly of expenditures. In this treatment of financial 
accounting, however, we have tried to avoid too technical a

discussion, as unsuited to the requirements of most practical 
school-men. We have aimed at a general interpretation of 
the subject of accounting, rather than at a presentation of 
an elaborate system. This phase of the problem must be 
left to the trained accountant who is also versed in the needs 
and difficulties of financial accounting in schools. 
In pursuance of this general plan, the chapter first took 
note of the defects in current accounting methods, ranging 
from slight maladjustments to the complete absence of ac- 
counts of any kind. Next, the functions of a modern ac- 
counting system were reviewed, emphasizing its relations 
to the budget and to unit-cost studies, and the fact that it 
is indispensable to any business-like administration. The 
qualities of adequacy, simplicity, and standard uniformity, 
as necessary to an acceptable plan, were noted and de- 
scribed. The general discussion was then closed by analyz- 
ing an efficient system into its essential parts. Here the 
schedule of accounts proposed by the National Education 
Association Joint Committee on Uniform Records and Re- 
ports was introduced as the most promising effort toward 
the standardization of ledger accounts. 
Following this general discussion, several individual ac- 
counting systems were briefly surveyed in order to bring in 
the element of concreteness. These systems included two 
rather elaborate plans, a simplified plan for use in small 
school systems, and a plan for State-wide application under 
the direction of a State department of education. Whether 
any or none of these plans should ever enjoy wide currency, 
they are doubtless indicative of the nature of the system 
that will finally prevail. 
The chapter ended with some unsettled problems. These 
are concerned with the place of interest and depreciation in 
both the accounting system and the computation of unit- 
costs. A tendency is evident to recognize both of these 
factors in both administrative situations.

FINANCIAL RECORDS AND ACCOUNTS 149 
This chapter concludes the group of chapters dealing with 
the interrelated topics of budgets, unit-costs, and account- 
ing. These topics form a closed circle. The next chapter 
will step outside this circle and take up a new aspect of local 
school finance. This is the problem of when and how to 
assume indebtedness for educational purposes. 
TOPICS FOR INVESTIGATION AND DISCUSSION 
1. Make a collection of the printed forms used in city school systems in 
your State, for carrying through and recording financial transactions. 
Criticize each of these sets of forms from the standpoint of the dis- 
cussion presented in this chapter. 
2. Obtain copies of blanks furnished by the State department of edu- 
cation to the public schools of your State, for the making of financial 
reports. Is the form of these blanks such as to stimulate the keeping 
of adequate, standardized accounts in the various schools? What 
suggestions can you make for the improvement of these report forms? 
8. Perhaps the most urgent problem in this field at present is that of 
devising a simple and yet adequate plan of financial accounting for 
small school systems. Here is an opportunity for valuable construc- 
tive investigation on the part of interested and properly qualified 
students.

  CHAPTER VI 
SCHOOL INDEBTEDNESS 
Purpose of this chapter. Public, like private, business is 
frequently tempted to run into debt. This is especially 
true of the schools, which carry a heavy load of annual ex- 
penditures and are at the same time required to make fre- 
quent large investments for plant and equipment. Very few 
schools seem able at present to meet these capital outlays, 
and at the same time take care of their regular expenses, 
from their current income. ‘Their only choice seems to be 
to get along with present inadequate or obsolete facilities or 
go into debt. So frequently has the latter of these alter- 
natives been chosen that there are few debt-free schools, 
especially in cities, in existence to-day. 
The accumulation of past debts, together with the con- 
stant pressure to contract new ones, raises a very serious 
problem for many school authorities. When and how to go 
into debt for educational purposes are questions which are 
continually confronting superintendents and boards of school 
control for solution. These officers are not always aware 
that there are a few accepted principles and practices which 
will greatly help in answering both questions. Consequently, 
the questions are not infrequently answered to suit the im- 
mediate convenience of the community involved. The re- 
sult is the incurring of indebtedness for unwarrantable pur- 
poses or in unjustifiable ways, and a mortgaging of the 
future to pay for present mistakes. The aim of this chapter 
is to make available the gist of current expert opinion on 
these problems of school indebtedness. 
The “pay-as-you-go” policy. In considering the advisa- 
bility of a school district’s going into debt, it is necessary to
-P-A-G-E-167
  SCHOOL INDEBTEDNESS 153 
discriminate between two kinds of educational expenditure. 
One is expenditure for “current needs,” while the other com- 
prises what are known as “capital outlays.” Regarding the 
first there seems to be little difference of opinion. The pay- 
as-you-go method is always to be preferred when practical. 
Opinion is not so uniform as to the best method of providing 
for capital outlays, although here also there is a strong de- 
fense of the conservative policy. 
With respect to current expenditures, it is maintained that 
schools, like private persons or families, should try to live 
within their incomes. If the present income will not suffice, 
it must be increased or the demands upon it decreased. If 
the income cannot now be raised sufficiently to care for cur- 
rent requirements, almost never can a sufficient increase be 
hoped for in the future to take care of indebtedness and 
meet the then current needs. Moreover, the average school 
must reckon with the necessity for constantly making new 
capital outlays. These alone will usually entail as much 
indebtedness as the district can well bear. Assuming a debt 
to meet current costs is almost certain to entail uncomfort- 
able retrenchments, both in capital outlays and current ex- 
penditures, in the future. 
The financial policy now recommended for schools can be 
summarized briefly in these words: Follow the pay-as-you-go 
plan in meeting all current expenses, and as far as possible in 
making capital outlays; but where, as will sometimes hap- 
pen, borrowing is necessitated, borrow as small an amount 
for as short a time and at as low an interest rate as is 
practicable. 
An argument and an example, both bearing upon this 
policy, are here inserted: 
There are two methods by which the board of education may 
raise funds for capital outlay: first, by local taxation; second, by 
selling bonds. The city that adopts the first policy attempts to
-P-A-G-E-168
  154 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
pay for its school plant as it goes. It places a premium on eco- 
nomical methods of financing the development of its physical plant. 
It aligns itself with the soundest school practice as recommended 
by those who have given the study of capital outlay for school 
purposes the most careful attention.! 
In 1904, a school was built for $75,000 with the entire issue of 
bonds falling due in 1914. When we refunded these in 1914 we had 
paid $33,750 as interest without reducing the principal one dollar. 
We were compelled to choose one of two courses, either refund the 
entire amount and make them all ten-year bonds, and pay another 
$33,750 interest; or make them payable serially and pay off the 
issue in ten years. Our board wisely chose the latter method and 
will pay the last bond in 1924, but will have then exnended for 
interest $60,825. By a direct tax spread over two fiscal years the 
needed amount could have been raised at the rate of $2 per $1000 
valuation, this rate being figured on a valuation that was less than 
50 per cent of the true property value, or a tax of approximately $1 
for $1000 valuation of actual property value.? 
The foregoing statements represent the view of perhaps 
the majority of educators writing on this subject. There 
are, however, persons who take a more liberal view of the 
matter. These persons contend that emergencies may arise, 
after the budget has been passed and the tax levy completed, 
which will compel the board to borrow money to finish out, 
the fiscal year. The experiences of many schools just after 
the War, when the teachers’ salary emergency became poign- 
ant, are pointed to as evidence. Here, however, only short- 
term borrowing is recommended, and along lines described in 
a later section of this chapter. 
These same persons are more aggressive in their defense 
of borrowing to meet capital outlays. As borrowing for this 
purpose usually involves bonding, their arguments on this

SCHOOL INDEBTEDNESS 155 
matter will be discussed in connection with that topic. 
Whatever may be thought of the reasoning there presented, 
it must be recognized that school districts occasionally find 
themselves in situations which seem to make borrowing for 
capital outlays imperative. Such is the case of the city 
which is far behind in its building program, or which is 
forced to provide accommodations suddenly for a large in- 
flux of children. Such also is the condition of the city with 
an already overwhelming accumulation of debts now falling 
due, and with a large current program of maintenance and 
expansion. Such may be the case even of the city with a 
large and growing school population and a small property 
valuation. Whatever the theory in the matter, a practical 
observer will hardly deny that a school cannot always escape 
the trammels of debt. 
The fact that many competent persons defend borrowing 
as a legitimate means of providing for school expenditures; 
the fact that borrowing is practically inescapable in certain 
circumstances; and the fact that, rightly or wrongly, borrow- 
ing is almost habitually resorted to by perhaps a majority 
of schools, all make a treatment of the problems of school 
indebtedness imperative upon us here, in spite of the seem- 
ingly growing popularity of the pay-as-you-go policy. 
Extent of school indebtedness. The value of all public 
school property in the United States, in 1919-20, is given as 
nearly $2,500,000,000. ‘The amount of money owed by the 
schools was more than $650,000,000. The value of this 
property per school child was $112; the amount of indebted- 
ness per school child was over $30. In other words, the debts 
of the schools amounted to about thirty per cent of their 
total permanent investments. 
It must not, of course, be inferred from these figures that 
this indebtedness was evenly distributed. Evidence, as 
1U.S. Bureau of Education, Bulletin no. 29 (1922), pp. 21 and 23, 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  156 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
well as observation, demonstrates that it was not. Thus 
Clark reports, ! for 199 cities of thirty thousand or more pop- 
ulation, in 1915, that 
Indebtedness per capita ranges from nothing up to between $30 
and $32.50. The mode falls in the group of cities having a per 
capita indebtedness of from $2.50 to $5.00. The median indebted- 
ness per inhabitant is $8.70, and the standard deviation, computed 
from the median, is $6.70, or 77 per cent of thé median. It will be 
noted that the distribution is skewed; the cities cluster at the lower 
end of the scale. 
Not all schools, then, are in debt; and the larger propor- 
tion of those that are in debt carry a relatively small load. 
There is this much encouragement in the situation, but 
against these facts is to be placed the fact that school debts 
approximate thirty per cent of the value of all school pro- 
perty in the United States. This fact, moreover, gains added 
seriousness when it is remembered that school indebtedness 
is only a part of our total public indebtedness. Debts are 
contracted for roads, streets, parks, and other public im- 
provements, as well as for schools. In certain parts of the 
country it is almost the rule for small cities to be bonded up 
to their utmost legal limits. These considerations seem to 
justify the contention of many school-men that school in- 
debtedness must be reduced, rather than increased, by the 
observance of better business principles in the financing of 
education. 
School indebtedness and the growth of cities. There is 
a stock belief to the effect that schools in rapidly growing 
cities must inevitably run into debt. To test this theory, 
Clark studied the indebtedness and rate of increase, from 
1900 to 1910, of two hundred and four cities of thirty thou- 
sand or more population.? He found a positive Pearson 
1 Clark, Earle, in American School Board Journal, March, 1917, p. 17.

-P-A-G-E-171
SCHOOL INDEBTEDNESS 157 
correlation of plus 0.26. ‘There is, then, a slight positive 
correlation between indebtedness and growth.” But “the 
correspondence is seen to be slight . . . very many cities have 
grown rapidly without having been forced to incur debts of 
exceptional magnitude. ... Rapidity of growth is not, then, 
an unanswerable argument for an increase of indebtedness.” 
Effect of indebtedness on current expenditures. “As 
interest upon debts and current expenses for operation and 
maintenance must both be paid out of current revenues, it 
would seem, in principle, that the existence of indebtedness 
would tend to limit expenditure. Does it?” Clark also 
presents data secured from one hundred and ninety-nine 
cities bearing upon this question. He concludes that “the 
cities which spend most freely for the operation and main- 
tenance of schools are, in general, the ones that have the 
largest school debts. The result,” he says, “is the reverse 
of what might perhaps have been expected.” 
Clark holds that the evidence does not demonstrate either 
that large current expenditures are productive of large debts, 
or that large debts produce large expenditures. Rather, 
they may both result from the same underlying cause — a 
deeply-seated enthusiasm for and generosity towards the 
schools. “A willingness to assume burdens in order to obtain 
satisfactory schools may be the common cause which is re- 
sponsible for the correlation noted.” 
Major types of school indebtedness. School debts as- — 
_ sume various forms. The major classification, perhaps, is 
into (1) short-time loans, such as notes, overdue warrants 
issued as debts, etc., and (2) bonds. Bonds are long-term 
notes, especially printed or engraved for the purpose in 
relatively small, convenient, and salable denominations, with 
interest coupons attached. Practically all long-time public 
borrowing is accomplished through the sale of bonds. In 
1 Clark, Earle, in American School Board Journal, March, 1917, pp. 17-19.
-P-A-G-E-172
  
158 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
1919-20, more than ten elevenths of the total school indebt- 
edness of more than $650,000,000 was in the form of bonds.! 
The different varieties of school bonds, and the relative 
advantages of each sort, will be discussed below. Here we 
may observe the arguments favoring short-term loans in 
preference to any kind of bonds. 
When a school district draws upon its credit for a short 
period it is sure to make immediate plans for repayment. 
When it issues long-time bonds it is likely to postpone or 
even forget to make such provision. Also, in short-term 
borrowing it is more likely to be concerned in keeping the 
amount of the debt and the interest rate down to the lowest 
possible figure. Short-time borrowing, in contrast with 
bonding, encourages thrift and safe planning. On the other 
hand, a school district can seldom borrow a very large 
amount in this way. It is therefore usually restricted to 
small loans to tide over unexpected emergencies. For this 
purpose the method is ideal, but even here it should be used 
with extreme caution, for the repayment of the loan is likely 
to present an embarrassing problem when the time arrives 
for making out the new budget. As in private borrowing, 
short-time loans should not be taken on by school districts 
unless the way for repaying them can be clearly seen. 
Arguments for and against bonding. Three arguments 
are frequently advanced in support of bonding as a method 
of financing capital outlays for schools. First, it is held in 
justification of the deferred payments involved in bonding 
that, as it is the children who benefit most directly from 
good schools, it is proper to ask these children to help later 
to pay for the education that they are now receiving, when 
they become men and women. Emphasis is given to this 
argument by the fact that the earning capacity of these men 
and women will be greater in consequence of the money now 
1U,S. Bureau of Education, Bulletin no. 29 (1922), p. 23,
-P-A-G-E-173
  SCHOOL INDEBTEDNESS 159 
spent upon the schools. In answer to this argument it is 
held, first, that this argument applies in principle to bonding 
for current expenditures as well as for capital outlays, and 
second, that every generation is in duty bound to provide a 
satisfactory education for its own children. Moreover, the 
cost of supporting schools increases enormously from normal 
causes from generation to generation, without the handing 
down of unpaid debts. Evidence of this fact has been pre- 
sented in our first chapter, where it was shown that, since 
1870, school expenditures have grown much more rapidly 
than have population or school attendance. 
A second argument sometimes used in favor of bonding 
is that the normal rise of property values in American cities 
may be counted on to offset interest charges on the debt. 
To this the answer is made that while the argument may 
hold at times for investments in school sites, it seldom if ever 
holds for investments in school buildings and equipment. 
In fact, owing to their rapid obsolescence, school buildings 
depreciate in value more rapidly than property of almost 
any other sort, to which must further be added the fact that 
there is almost no market for disused school buildings and 
equipment. 
In the third place, the advocates of bonding defend the 
practice on the ground that it keeps community capital at 
work in private hands, instead of depriving the taxpayers 
of their capital by heavy immediate taxation... The commu- 
nity, it is held, can realize from this capital more than enough 
to pay the interest on the bonds, but here the opponents of 
bonding reply that the practice encourages careless expendi- 
ture, with consequent waste and even graft. One writer! 
puts the matter in these words: 
Bond money, being “easy money,” is often wasted. Probably no   
1 Talbert, W. E., in American School Board Journal, April, 1918, pp. 21-22.
-P-A-G-E-174
  160 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
form of expenditure is less carefully watched by the public than the 
“bonded construction fund.” Even payments of interest and 
principal are generally taken care of automatically by county offi- 
cials, and the local school authorities know little about how much 
is being collected. 
This same writer, in the same article, phrases other argu- 
ments against bonding as follows: 
, An issue of bonds affects public credit as a mortgage affects 
private credit....Each issue of bonds makes succeeding issues 
harder to sell, and consequently makes them bring a lower price, or 
bear a higher rate of interest, or both.... 
When bonds are voted, taxes have to be levied to pay for them, 
and that makes it increasingly hard to meet current expenses as 
time goes on.... 
Bonds . . . constitute the most expensive known means of obtain- 
ing public funds. This is due to the amount of interest that has to 
be paid in addition to the cost of the improvement itself. 
Perhaps the most forceful argument that can be made in 
support of bonding is that, in the present state of public 
opinion about taxation, it is unavoidable. It is psychologi- 
cally necessary, whether economically sound or not. The 
average school community simply will not tax itself in any 
one year sufficiently to pay for any large capital outlay as a 
part of its current budget. This being the case, the practical 
problems before us are: (1) to find a reasonable justification 
for resorting to bonding in any particular case, and (2) to 
determine the best type of bonds to issue and the best plan 
for issuing and redeeming them. ‘These questions will 
occupy our attention for most of the remainder of this 
chapter. 
Justifying a bond issue. The problem of justifying a local 
bond issue presents two phases; one, the self-justification of 
the school authorities for resorting to this method for financ- 
ing a school project, and the other, the justification of the
-P-A-G-E-175
  SCHOOL INDEBTEDNESS 161 
bond issue before the public who must assume the obliga- 
tion and pay it off. This second phase is an aspect of school 
financial publicity, and will be considered in a later chapter 
devoted to that subject. Here we are concerned with the 
circumstances that would seem to justify a school board and 
superintendent in asking the people of a community to vote 
school bonds. 
As has already been indicated, “it is accepted that bonds 
should be issued only when a plan of capital outlay is in- 
- volved.”” Many States prescribe the outlays for which 
bonds may be issued legally. In thirty-nine States they may 
be issued for building schoolhouses, in thirty-seven for pur- 
chasing school sites, in thirty-four for furnishing buildings 
or for renewing or refunding old bonds, in twenty-two for the 
repair of schoolhouses, in fourteen for additions to school 
buildings, in thirteen for the maintenance of schools, in 
four for paying teachers’ salaries, and in two States for in- 
surance of school property or for meeting emergency con- 
ditions.* 
It is also recognized that bonding should not be resorted 
to unless the amount involved is sufficient to justify the 
expense incurred. A statement in point here is as follows: ? 
The Tax-Payers’ Association of California has in its files records 
of very small school bond issues, some of them for less than $500, 
which have recently been voted in school districts of California. 
Occasionally, relatively small issues are also found in cities. 
In all such cases, the cost of election and the cost of validating 
and selling the bonds, together with an unusually high rate of in- 
terest, make the cost out of all proportion to the benefit. In most 
cases, the money could be raised with less trouble and expense by a 
direct tax. 
But the work of self-justification on the part of the board

-P-A-G-E-176
162 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
or superintendent is not complete when it has been settled 
that the purpose of the proposed bond issue is legal and that 
the amount involved is great enough to warrant the expense. 
There remains to show that the school district really needs 
the acquisition to be secured as a result of the indebtedness, 
and particularly that it can afford that acquisition. Thus 
Fowlkes writes ! that 
| it is even more essential to prove that the community is able to 
finance the proposed issue without serious inconvenience, or hazard 
to its credit. . . . Some of the best measures of a community’s ability 
to finance school building programs are per capita wealth (on true 
value basis), school tax rate, total tax rate for municipal expendi- 
tures, total and per capita expenditure for capital outlay for schools, 
bonded debt, and the relation of bonded debt to assessed wealth. 
These data must all be interpreted by comparisons with 
similar facts for other communities. The grave duty now 
incumbent upon school authorities, as trustees of public 
funds, to study carefully the whole situation in their 
schools before urging communities to encumber them- 
selves with large bond issues, is well shown in this state- 
ment: # 
As a result of the War experience, taxpayers seem more ready to 
vote large bond issues. Thus in K- , Michigan, in 1914 there 
was much complaint about an existing debt of $568,000. But in 
1919 an additional bond issue of $610,000 was carried, without the 
public even inquiring as to the interest rate.   
Too frequently, it is feared, the “putting over” of a large 
bond issue upon his community is regarded by the school 
superintendent as a sort of game, the merit of which lies in 
the winning rather than in the value of the game itself. 
The whole contention of this section is the antithesis of that 
viewpoint. School officers, including the superintendent,

  SCHOOL INDEBTEDNESS 
are in duty bound to determine intelligently th, 
of a bond issue in the full light of the needs an 
community before putting the proposition to the pu- 
vote. Otherwise, they will have failed to discharge a pri- 
mary obligation of educational leadership. 
Types of bonds. School bonds are of two main types; 
straight or sinking-fund bonds, and serial bonds. They are 
thus described by Fowlkes.? 
A straight or sinking-fund bond is one floated for a specified 
number of years, bearing interest annually, semi-annually, or 
quarterly, all of the principal being payable at the date of maturity. 
... Payment is provided for by means of a sinking fund, which 
may or may not be invested. ... A serial bond is one that is retired 
by payments made at regular intervals, interest being paid an- 
nually, semi-annually, or quarterly, as desired.     
  Serial bonds are also of two kinds.? The installment bond 
is “one in which the loan is repaid to the lender by equal 
annual installments of the principal only, and interest is paid 
upon the balance of the loan unpaid.” The annuity bond is 
“one under which there is, as in the case of the installment 
method, an actual repayment each year to the lender.... 
In this case, however, the lender receives an equal amount 
each year, composed of principal and interest combined.” 
Each type of bond has its advantages and its disadvan- 
tages, although the serial types are generally preferred to 
the sinking-fund type. The advantages claimed for the in- 
stallment type are simplicity, cheapness as compared with 
sinking-fund bonds, ease of administration, and a progres- 
sive decrease in the size of the payments, the heaviest one 
coming first and the lightest last. The disadvantages are 
the inequality of the demands made upon revenue sources 
1 Fowlkes, J. G.,in American School Board Journal, January, 1923, p. 41. 
2See Powers, L. C., in American School Board Journal, July, 1916, pp. 
19-20. 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
      
  PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
from year to year, and the disfavor of lenders, in the case of 
small issues, because of the return of the principal in small 
installments. 
For the annuity type these advantages are claimed: An 
equal charge is made against the revenue each year, and it is 
cheaper than the sinking-fund bond. On the other hand, 
payments are computed with difficulty; the accounting is 
awkward, especially in the case of trust funds; and lenders 
dislike the return of their investments in small payments. 
In defense of the sinking-fund type it is said that inves- 
tors prefer it because it returns their principal to them in 
one lump sum; that, properly arranged, it makes an equal 
annual demand upon the school revenues; and that, if the 
sinking fund is wisely invested, the income therefrom will 
offset the interest on the bonds. Against this type, how- 
ever, several charges are made. It is very complex in form; 
there is grave danger of allowing the bonds to mature with- 
out an adequate sinking fund having been built up; and the 
plan is the most costly one of all because of the amount of 
interest called for and the practical difficulties in the way of 
investing the sinking fund profitably. 
Formerly, school bonds were mostly of the sinking-fund 
type. In recent years, however, the serial type, either an- 
nuity or installment, has been growing in favor. This type 
is now required by law in some States. The preference of 
educational writers for the serial form of bond is illustrated 
by the following quotations: 
The serial bond is without doubt the most acceptable one, and 
no doubt results in the greatest financial economy, in as much as 
both principal and interest, as well as taxes thereon, are reduced 
from year to year. All the fine principles of sound financing are no 
doubt embodied therein.! 
The decided superiority of the serial type of bond for all muni-

-P-A-G-E-179
SCHOOL INDEBTEDNESS 
  cipal securities of long standing has been recognized ! 
authorities in municipal finance. .. . However, it i 
think that a school district automatically saves any mox.__ 
the adoption of the serial plan. . .. The inherent advantages on 
serial system are administrative and political rather than financial, 
but, because of lax control and indisereet management of sinking 
funds, the serial plan has proved superior on a financial as well as 
on an administrative basis. 
Size of bonds, and the interest rate. In selling bonds of 
any type, bonds of regular denominations — $1000 or $500 
—vwwill always sell at a better price — that is, a lower rate 
of interest — than will bonds of irregular denominations. 
One occasionally finds bonds issued so that a $333.33 bond, 
or some other odd amount, matures yearly. As bond- 
buyers usually buy in $1000 units, such odd figure bonds 
always have to bear a higher interest rate to sell them, or, 
what amounts to the same thing, sell at a lower price. 
The same is true with reference to interest rates. An in- 
terest rate so high that it is much above the market rate for 
money for such bonds causes the bond to sell at a premium, 
and an interest rate below the market rate for money 
causes the bond to sell at a discount. Discount bonds or par 
bonds can nearly always be sold on a better basis than pre- 
mium bonds. A bond-selling house recently advertized for 
sale three different issues of school bonds of the same Cali- 
fornia city, and all of near the same date of maturity, at the 
following prices and yields: 
5 per cent bonds at 106.6, to yield 4.60 per cent 
43 per cent bonds at 100.0, to yield 4.50 per cent 
4 per cent bonds at 93.5, to yield 4.40 per cent 
Short-term bonds preferred. The statements inserted 
here will show the attitude of writers on the question of the 
length of time that school bonds should be allowed to run.

The period for which bonds are to run should never exceed the 
substantial usefulness of the improvement. Ordinarily, ten years 
should be sufficient. A longer term than twenty years should be 
unlawful. ! 
In the past, communities have been prone to shift the responsi- 
bility of payment, in part at least, to later generations, thereby 
imposing a burden upon a group of people who were not the 
beneficiaries. This is undemocratic as well as unsound. It is un- 
wise to issue school bonds for a term of years that exceeds the 
period for which adequate services will be provided. 
The length of time a school bond issue is to run should depend 
upon the needs of the general school building program as well as 
the estimated life of the new buildings that are to be created im- 
mediately. For the sake of economy the term of years should be 
as small as possible for the interest that is paid in a long-term bond 
issue quite often equals the original principal.? 
The issuing process. When the school authorities have 
determined to their satisfaction that their district should 
assume a bonded obligation, there arises the problem of 
securing an issue that will be both legal and profitable to the 
borrowers. The general procedure followed in issuing 
school bonds may be covered in three or four steps. 
1 The bonds must be voted by the board of education and duly 
recorded in the board’s minutes. If the law does not require 
this action to be endorsed by the district or by other local 
authorities, step three may be entered upon at once. 
If action by the district is required, an election should be 
called in legal form, usually after advertising its purpose for 
a prescribed period. The results of the election should be 
certified in legal form. 
The legality of all action to this point should be carefully 
established. Frequently this will involve securing a vali- 
dation of the proposed issue by some specified State au- 
thority. 
The sale of the bonds should be publicly advertised and bids 
called for.

  SCHOOL INDEBTEDNESS 167 
In pursuing these steps, it is of the greatest importance 
that all legal regulations governing the voting, validating, 
and selling of the bonds be complied with in the strictest 
terms. Occasionally, the marketability of an entire issue 
may be destroyed by some unfortunate inadvertence in 
these matters. Both school boards and school districts are 
frequently restricted, as to the purposes, forms, and manner 
of issue, by State legislation. Where this is true, both board 
and district must meet these regulations fully, and must 
carefully avoid exceeding the powers legally belonging to 
them. Following are the limitations most frequently im- 
posed: 
1. The purposes of bond issues are legally prescribed in many 
States. “School bonds issued without statutory authority, 
or for an unauthorized purpose, are void.” “It is necessary 
that it shall appear clearly on the face of the proceedings for 
the issuance of school bonds that they are issued only for the 
purpose authorized by statute.” 
2. “The power to issue school bonds often is given upon con- 
dition that a vote of the electors of the district is necessary to 
authorize the issue and define its purposes. . . . If the election 
is not legally called the bonds issued in pursuance of the vote 
are invalid.” A legal call for a bond election must often be 
based upon a petition signed by a specified number of voters. 
8. Unless the law makes special provision for it, bonds cannot be 
legally marketed for less than par value. 
4. In many States there is legal debt limit for a school district 
which may not be exceeded even by vote of the qualified 
electors. When a bond issue, either by itself or together with 
previous unpaid issues, exceeds this limit, it becomes illegal, 
either in whole or in part. 
5. In several States, legal bond issues must be endorsed and 
recorded for validation by some specified State. authority 
before being placed on the market for sale.! 
The question will sometimes arise as to the type of pur-

Board Journal, June, 1919, pp. 58-59.

chaser who should be sought for school bonds. Some 
authorities prefer to sell through brokers, as other public 
bonds are sold, while others prefer an “over-the-counter” 
sale to small investors. This second plan is described and 
defended by one writer,! thus: 
Some city treasurers and others have advocated a new method of 
selling bonds by disposing of them in small lots directly over the 
counter of the treasurer’s office....The advantages claimed by 
those who favor this method are the following: 
1. That prospective investors would always find an open market 
for their idle funds. 
2. That funds would be available when needed, and delays in 
many cases avoided. 
8. That the small investor, who usually invests in municipal 
bonds, would financially profit by such direct and personal 
investment. 
4, That citizens would be made bondholders of local issues. 
5. And last, that the district would under such circumstances 
not have to pay such high interest rates. 
The only disadvantage they admit is where occasion demands 
quick sales. 
The redeeming process. Three plans are in common use 
for redeeming bond issues when due. One is through sink- 
ing funds; another is through current funds; and the third 
is through the issuance of new bonds to replace old ones 
falling due. The last method is really not a method of re- 
demption at all, but a mere renewal of the obligation, yet, 
in 1919-20, nearly one fifth of all school bonds falling due 
were taken up in this way. The figures were: Paid from 
sinking funds, about $23,000,000; paid from current funds, 
about $20,000,000; and funded by the issuing of new bonds, 
about $10,000,000.? 
Naturally, whether an issue is redeemed out of current

  SCHOOL INDEBTEDNESS 169 
funds or from a sinking fund depends upon whether the issue 
has been in straight or serial bonds. The methods of re- 
demption appropriate to these two forms are described by 
Talbert,! thus: 
By the sinking-fund method a sufficient amount is set aside each 
year to accumulate at compound interest enough money to pay off 
both interest and principal. There are so many possibilities for 
errors in calculation and for misdirection of funds by this method 
that it is prohibited in some states and is generally looked upon 
with disfavor by investors. It is the most expensive type in 
common use, and should by all means be avoided wherever possible. 
By the annuity method an equal sum composed of combined 
interest and principal is paid off each year. The computations 
required are so complex that it has not come into very general use 
for the payment of school bonds. 
By the serial or installment method regular installments are paid 
on the principal and interest is paid annually on the unpaid balance. 
This method is the cheapest; it is simple in operation; officials do 
not forget to make payments; and, if the repayment is properly 
planned, the largest installments of combined interest and principal 
come during the earlier years when the greatest advantages are 
being reaped and before the heavier maintenance charges and the 
heavier depreciation become operative. 
Another phase of the matter of bond redemption is de- 
scribed in the same article by this same writer, when he says: 
Unless the debt is divided into equal installments, the larger 
payments should be made first — by those who are responsible for 
the issue, by those who are enjoying the improvement most, and 
by those who have the least to pay for maintenance. Such a plan 
also very materially lessens the amount of interest. 
The main thing to be avoided in the redeeming of bonds 
is the mere exchange of old bonds for new ones. _ There 
is little danger of this is the case of serial bonds, where the 
payments must be met annually. Most often this disaster 
comes from the failure to build up a sinking fund by setting 
1In American School Board Journal, April, 1918, pp. 21-22.
-P-A-G-E-184
  170 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
aside annually regular increments from the current revenue 
to pay off the principal when it falls due. Sometimes the 
sinking fund is partially built up, and then dissipated 
through mismanagement. More often the difficulty is of 
the first sort mentioned, and results from the fact that 
school board membership changes rather frequently, and 
that the period of bonded indebtedness covers a long period 
of years. A school board member to-day may not consider 
very seriously a debt which was incurred ten years ago, by 
other persons, and which will not have to be paid until ten 
years hence, again by other persons. Consequently when 
the necessity for economizing is felt, a cut is quite likely to 
be made in the amount set aside for the sinking fund, al- 
ways with the expectation, of course, of making up the de- 
ficiency later. But a deficiency once permitted is seldom 
made up. Instead, the action becomes a precedent, and 
neglect of the sinking fund becomes a habit. The fact that 
serial bonds do not offer this temptation so readily is one of 
the greatest points in their favor. 
State control. Due to abuses of the bonding privilege by 
local officials and even by communities, many States have 
passed laws regulating the issuance of bonds. Several of 
these regulations have already been suggested, such as — 
1. Depriving district officials of authority to issue bonds without 
an affirmative vote of the qualified electors, at an election 
legally called for the purpose. 
2. Placing a limit upon the amount of indebtedness that may be 
assumed by a district, even by popular vote. This limit is in 
terms of a stipulated amount upon each unit of valuation of 
the district. 
8. Requiring the issuance of some form of serial bonds and 
prohibiting that of sinking-fund bonds. 
4. Requiring that local school bonds be registered with some 
State officer for validation before permitting them to be 
placed upon the market. 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
  SCHOOL INDEBTEDNESS 171 
The movement toward State control, of which these 
regulations are examples, now promises to become even more 
far-reaching.’ An example of this wider movement is found 
in the recommendations of the California Tax-Payers’ As- 
sociation, which, if enacted into law, would mean a transfer 
from local to State officials of all power of action except de- 
ciding on the amount of the issue and the maximum rate 
of interest. Even here an upper limit would be fixed by 
State law. The State, then, through a special officer pro- 
vided for the purpose, would take charge of the validating 
and issuing of all bonds, and would guarantee their legality 
and payment. 
Chapter summary. At the outset of this chapter, we have 
distinguished between expenditures for current maintenance 
of schools and capital outlays. The former expenditures 
should be met so far as possible from current revenues, 
supplemented in extreme emergencies by short-term borrow- 
ing. The latter expenditures may be met in any of three 
ways, named in order of preference: by taxation, as a part of 
the current budget; by short-term borrowing; or by bonding. 
While bonding is the least desirable of the three methods 
named, it is the method most commonly employed for meet- 
ing large capital outlays. There are arguments against the 
practice, and arguments for it; but arguments are more or 
less beside the point. Bonding is here. The real problem is 
when and how to do it. 
As to when, bonds should be issued only for permanent 
outlays, where the need is great, where the amount involved 
is large, and where the district is manifestly able to bear the 
interest burden and meet the obligation when due. 
As to how, it seems to be almost universally maintained 
that school bonds should be short-term serials, preferably of 
the installment type. The great advantages of these bonds 
are the interest saving involved, and the practical certainty
-P-A-G-E-186
  172 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
of their being paid on the date of their maturity. The old- 
type sinking-fund bonds are rapidly falling into disrepute 
among school-men. To insure their validity arid marketabil- 
ity, bonds should be issued in strict conformity to law; and to 
preserve the credit of the district and clear the field to meet 
future demands, all bonds should be paid when due. State 
laws now regulate the amount, form, and manner of issue of 
local bonds in many places. There is evidence of a tendency 
toward still greater State control and participation. 
TOPICS FOR INVESTIGATION AND DISCUSSION 
1. Do you know of any instances of the “‘pay-as-you-go”’ policy applied 
to capital outlays for schools? What was the size of the outlay in- 
volved? What specific measures were employed in financing the out- 
lay in each case? 
2. Do you know of any instances of short-term borrowing for (1) un- 
expected maintenance costs, or (2) capital outlays? What form or 
forms did this borrowing take? 
8. Study the school indebtedness of some individual city, making note of 
following points: (1) comparative amount of city indebtedness for 
schools and for other municipal purposes; (2) type of bonds employed; 
(3) identity of bondholders, where ascertainable; (4) condition of 
sinking fund, where used; (5) history of city’s promptness or delin- 
quency in meeting school bond issues that have already matured. 
4. Do you know of any instance where the existence of a large school 
indebtedness has interfered with the proper maintenance or expansion 
of the schools? Describe this situation in detail. 
5. Do you know of any instances where a large school indebtedness has 
interfered with progress in other than an educational direction? 
Describe in detail. 
6. Select a specific city or other local educational unit. What educational 
outlays requiring indebtedness are needed in this situation? How 
would you justify a bond issue covering such indebtedness to the local 
public? 
7. To what extent, and in what ways, does your State seek to safeguard 
and otherwise regulate the issuance of bonds by local schools?

CHAPTER VII 
THE CONTROL OF SCHOOL FINANCES 
Purpose of this chapter. The phases of local financial man- 
agement which have been considered in previous chapters 
comprise budget-making, cost comparisons, accounting, and 
indebtedness. Incidentally in the discussion of these phases 
we have mentioned the person or persons who should be held 
responsible for their direction or accomplishment. In this 
chapter, however, we must undertake a more explicit study 
of the placement of these duties and responsibilities. 
In early colonial times the entire management of a school, 
financial and otherwise, was vested in the town or district 
acting as a unit. This collective sort of management was 
effected through the school-meeting. At this meeting, by 
action of the voters attending, money was appropriated, 
taxes were levied, the teacher was employed, equipment was 
authorized, and all other necessary measures were taken for 
the establishment and maintenance of the school. A relic of 
this old-time procedure is found in the school meeting which 
is still a feature of district control in several States. 
There have been many changes, however, in the manage- 
ment of schools since colonial days. Among these changes 
has been the appearance of a personnel organization which 
has largely relieved the district proper of the detailed re- 
sponsibilities of management. First to evolve of this or- 
ganization was the school board, which took its rise in vol- 
untary school “committees,” appointed at district meetings 
to carry out specific directions. _ Later, there developed out 
of or in connection with these school boards the specialized 
office of superintendent of schools. Still later the office of 
school business manager made its appearance, and just as in 
 
-P-A-G-E-190

the first instance the rise of school boards meant a subtrac- 
tion from the powers and responsibilities of the district 
proper, so in the second instance the rise of specialized 
executive officers meant a subtraction from the powers 
and duties of the board. In this process, however, each 
party has retained certain of its original functions while 
handing others along to its successor. As a consequence, 
not a little disagreement, both in theory and in practice, now 
exists regarding the exact province of each. The problem 
is further complicated by the injection at certain places 
of State authority in management, and by the occasional 
participation of municipal or other local non-educational 
authorities. This confused situation is met in all depart- 
ments of school control, but is nowhere more evident than 
in the management of school finances. 
The general problem to be raised for discussion in this 
chapter may be crystallized into a few specific questions, 
as follows: 
* 1. What are the responsibilities of the school board in local 
financial management, as distinguished from the responsi- 
bilities still incumbent upon the people of the district, and 
upon the State? 
2. What part, if any, should municipal or other local non-edu- 
cational authorities play in the financial management of 
schools? 
8. What are the functions of the superintendent of schools, and 
of the school business manager, as distinguished from each 
other and from the board? 
The purpose of the present chapter is to review the more 
important opinions and practices with reference to each of 
these questions, to select therefrom the more satisfactory 
opinions and activities, and to. note the points which still 
remain in controversy. 
Financial responsibility of school boards. » The first con- 
sistent attempt to specialize and centralize the details of  
-P-A-G-E-191
  
CONTROL OF SCHOOL FINANCES 177 
school control resulted in the creation of the modern board 
of education. This board arose as a sort of committee pos- 
sessing power to act for the district which it represented. 
During this early period in the life of the school board no 
other managerial officers existed. All activities involved in 
the management of schools were performed either by the 
board or by the district. Consequently, the board was held 
definitely responsible for discharging in person all of the 
duties placed upon it. 
School boards continue even to-day to bear these same 
general responsibilities. Except in matters specifically re- 
served for district action, and in other matters in which the 
State or other agency is held definitely responsible, the 
modern school board is held completely responsible for 
every detail of current school control. This is true in spite 
of the fact, to be enlarged upon later, that much of the actual 
labor once performed by the board itself is now done by the 
superintendent of schools or the business manager. But 
these specialized officers of management are responsible 
only to the board, while the board alone is responsible to 
the district as a whole. An exception to this rule occurs, of 
course, in the case of county superintendents and other ex- 
ecutives who are elected by popular vote, but this method of 
selecting school administrative officers is rapidly being 
abandoned. 
Keeping in mind, then, that the school district will pro- 
perly hold the board responsible for every detail of school 
management not directly performed by the district itself, we 
may proceed to outline the responsibilities of the board. In 
so doing we do not mean to imply that the board must 
actually itself perform every action for which it is held re- 
sponsible. The question of what the board itself should do 
and what it should delegate to others will be examined below. 
Here we propose only to list the things for which the board
-P-A-G-E-192
    
  178   
‘ PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
may be held responsible, with hints as to the limits of its 
responsibility, as follows: 
1. o The board is held responsible for the selection, appointment, 
control, and compensation of all persons employed in the 
service of the school. As a rule, this responsibility is placed 
upon the board with practically no interference from the 
district. The only important external control is exerted 
through State laws or regulations governing the qualifications 
and certification of employees, especially of teachers. 
. The board is held responsible for the provision of the school 
site, and the construction and maintenance of the school 
plant. Here it is usually subject to a vote of endorsement by 
the district, particularly where bonding is involved. Certain 
legal limitations also are set up in the legislative enactments 
of several States. These enactments may cover such matters 
as the district’s bonding limit, and legal specifications for 
sites, buildings, and equipment. As an example, a school 
board’s plan for a new school building must conform in all 
respects to the State school building code. 
. The board is held responsible for determining the amount of 
the budget for each coming fiscal period, and for fixing, directly 
or indirectly, the local school tax rate. Here the extent of 
freedom granted to the board varies in the different States. 
In some States the board is without let or hindrance, except by 
legislative limitation upon the amount of the local tax rate. 
In others, the board is free to vote funds and assess taxes up 
to a certain limit (say four or six mills), but beyond this limit 
the endorsement of the voters of the district must be obtained. 
In still other States, all budgetary action of the board must be 
approved by the district voters. Still again, the action of the 
board, and even that of the district, must be scrutinized and 
approved by some municipal or other non-educational officer. 
(See below.) Not infrequently, also, the district’s right to 
tax itself for schools is circumscribed by state legislation fixing 
both a minimum and a maximum legal tax rate. 
. The board is held responsible for providing rules and regu- 
lations for the government of itself and of the school system. 
Here it is in general free to act within the limits set by the 
state general school code. 
. Finally, the board is held responsible for determining the ac- 
'
-P-A-G-E-193
  CONTROL OF SCHOOL FINANCES 179 
complishments and needs of the schools, and for represent- 
ing the same to the people. No restrictions are placed at this 
point upon the board’s activity, except such as are involved in 
the moral requirements of fairness and strict honesty. 
Not all of the matters just presented can be regarded as 
financial responsibilities. Four out of the six statements, 
however, do involve finance more or less directly. The 
others have been included so that the monetary matters 
might be seen in their true perspective. It appears that the 
major responsibilities of the board of education are financial 
in character, at least to a considerable degree. 
Theisen’s study of school board responsibilities. An- 
other approach to the board’s financial responsibilities is 
found in the list of school board duties prepared and ranked 
by Theisen.! This list, which is longer and more specific 
than the one given above, was very carefully made up. The 
ranking of the various items in the list was done by five 
hundred and thirty-one individual judges, including pro- 
fessors and advanced students of educational administration, 
superintendents and principals, board members, and re- 
sponsible business men. Only four of the nineteen items 
comprising the list are concerned directly with finance, but 
to these four the judges assigned the ranks of second, third, 
sixth, and seventh, respectively. These financial duties 
thus rank before nearly all the other duties assigned to 
school boards. Following are these four financial responsi- 
bilities, numbered according to their ranks in Theisen’s list. 
2. Pass upon the annual budget for maintenance prepared by 
the chief executive and his assistants. .. . 
8. Debate and pass upon recommendations of chief executive 
for additional capital outlays — buildings, sites, improve-

ments — and determine the means of financing such outlays; 
e.g., bonds, loans. ... 
6. Determine, after consultation and discussion with the chief 
executive, the schedule of salaries. 
7. Require and consider report of the business transacting or 
pending, and of the financial status of the system. 
From this summary it appears that almost the very chief 
among the board’s management responsibilities are those 
concerned with the direction of school finance. It is true 
that school boards are not yet given the complete freedom 
in handling financial problems that they enjoy in most other 
aspects of school control. But this complete freedom seems 
to be on the way. These financial responsibilities were 
about the last to be transferred by the districts out of their 
direct control into the hands of the board. Control over 
teachers and courses was much more readily given up by the 
districts than was control over funds. It is not strange that 
the districts still continue to exercise a certain amount of 
jealous supervision over financial matters. But the powers 
of the board are still growing; and, what is perhaps more im- 
portant, the board’s moral control, exerted through the force 
of its report on school conditions and its advice to the dis- 
trict, may be so used as almost completely to offset its pre- 
sent lack of complete legal power. 
Besides this supervision exercised by the districts, the 
financial responsibilities exercised by school boards are 
further limited by reservations of the State. The more im- 
portant of these reservations have been mentioned. At 
first thought, this intrusion of the State into local school con- 
cerns may seem rather singular, but the situation will be un- 
derstood when it is recalled that education is now regarded as 
a State rather than as a local matter. Such responsibilities 
for school control as reside in either the board or the district 
do so by grant, or at least by permission, of the sovereign
-P-A-G-E-195
  CONTROL OF SCHOOL FINANCES 181 
State. It thus follows that, in the control of school finance, 
the State has fixed certain responsibilities upon school 
boards, and others upon school districts acting as wholes. 
In each instance, though, it has reserved the right to limit 
these responsibilities as it may see fit. In the main, how- 
ever, the State’s reservations in matters of school finance 
are very general. 
Municipal control of school finance. There is another 
sort of limitation upon school boards in financial matters 
which, where it, is found, is even more restrictive than the 
limitations imposed by the State and the district. This is 
found most frequently in cities, and consists in requiring 
that the school budget, and sometimes the record of school 
expenditures, shall be reviewed by some municipal officer. 
This officer may be the mayor, or the city manager, or the 
city finance officer, or even the city council acting as a body. 
Where this form of restriction occurs the local school board 
is spoken of as “dependent” in type, as contrasted with the 
more common “independent” type of board which is re- 
sponsible only to the district and the State. The situation 
has been described by Frasier ! in these words: 
In financially independent city school districts the board of 
education has power to compile and adopt its own budget, levy its 
own tax or cause some other authority to levy under its direction, 
and expend the money as it deems right and proper. In fiscally 
dependent city school districts the board of education must submit 
its budget estimates to the municipal authorities, who revise and 
change it as they may desire and then it becomes a part of the 
regular city budget. School moneys thus raised are kept in the city 
treasury and paid out through the same channels as other city 
expenditures. 
In passing, it should be noted that this sort of restriction 
is not necessarily confined to cities. It may appear, for ex-

lishing Company, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
    182 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
ample, under the “county unit” plan of organization, in the 
requirement that the budget and expenditures of the county 
board of education shall be reviewed by other county of- 
ficials. But it is so seldom found outside the cities that it is 
not infrequently described as the “municipal plan.” 
Status of municipal control. While, as has been said, the 
fiscally-dependent type of school board is found most fre- 
quently in cities, it must not be inferred that city school 
boards are principally of this type. The contrary is true. 
In the reference just cited, Frasier reports upon the situation 
in 169 American cities, showing that fiscal independence pre- 
vailed in 96 of these cities, and fiscal dependence in 73. Def- 
fenbaugh states ! that, of 520 cities reporting to the national 
Bureau of Education in 1919-20, 
The board of education in 126 of these must refer their estimates 
to the city council or town finance committee, in 30 to a board of 
estimates, in 15 to the people, and in 51 to the county officials, thus 
leaving 298 of 520 boards of education free to make up their own 
estimates without referring them to any other body for approval. 
Fiscal independence of school boards thus appears to pre- 
vail in slightly more than fifty per cent of our cities at the 
present time. A possible tendency is seen in Frasier’s find- 
ing, in 1922, of seven fiscally dependent cities in a group in 
which Rollins had reported fourteen in 1902. The varying 
policies of States in this matter is shown in the following 
excerpt from an article by Watson: ? 
In some States, as Washington, South Dakota, and Oklahoma, 
the school district is a separate corporation and its financial inde- 
pendence is secure, even to the extent of issuing bonds; though 
usually the bond proposal must be ratified by a vote of the people 
of the district.

CONTROL OF SCHOOL FINANCES 183 
This is in sharp contrast to the practice of other States, where 
school budgets are subject to review and modification by the mayor 
as in Massachusetts, by the city council as in New Hampshire, 
Virginia, Vermont, and Wisconsin, by the board of estimate and ap- 
portionment as in New York, by State auditors as in New Mexico, 
or by the State tax commission as in Ohio. 
Frasier also reports an interesting observation regarding 
the bodies of opinion favoring and disfavoring this type of 
restriction upon school board control. He writes: ‘In gen- 
eral the authorities on municipal government favor fiscal 
dependence of city school districts, and in general the 
present-day authorities in educational administration favor 
fiscal independence.” Apparently, one’s attitude on this 
question depends to a degree upon whether he approaches 
it from the standpoint of securing efficient schools. In this 
same connection it is interesting to note that municipal 
office-holders in the State of New York are almost a unit in 
favoring municipal control of school finance, while the edu- 
cators of that State just as consistently oppose the plan. 
Arguments for fiscal dependence. ‘The arguments of 
those who support the municipal plan for school control, by 
making school authorities responsible to city authorities in 
financial concerns, naturally are largely in the nature of 
criticisms of the older plan of financial independence. “A 
few of their arguments, however, are more positive and con- 
structive, setting forth the advantages of the municipal plan. 
In the list presented below no attempt is made to separate 
the merely critical from the really constructive statements, 
but it will be observed by the discriminating reader that a 
criticism, however well taken, of one of these plans is not 
necessarily an argument for the other. 
1. It is held to be unfair and demoralizing for school 
boards, who determine school budgets and thus the school 
tax rates, to be without responsibility either for collecting
-P-A-G-E-198
  184 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
the taxes themselves or to other officials whose duty it is to 
collect taxes. As arule all city taxes are collected by regular 
city officers, who must bear the brunt of blame for excessive 
taxation. School expenditures consume from a third to a 
half of the tax income of the average city, yet the municipal 
officers, who collect these taxes, under the plan of fiscal in- 
dependence, have no control over the school board members 
who vote these taxes and spend the proceeds. This, it is 
maintained, is unfair to the responsible officers and demoral- 
izing to the ones not responsible. 
2. It is held that the superintendent of schools, who is 
directly responsible neither to the people nor to the munici- 
pal government, as a rule is the real dictator of the school 
budget and of the subsequent expenditure of school funds. 
This situation grows out, of the fact that school boards are 
composed of unpaid laymen, whose service is voluntary and 
more or less perfunctory, while the superintendent is a highly 
paid expert. Naturally, the laymen tend to accept rather 
uncritically the proposals of the superintendent; and, even 
if they should wish to exercise their right of criticism, they 
are at a disadvantage because of their lack of expert informa- 
tion. Moreover, the superintendent himself is likely to be 
the victim of his own intemperate enthusiasm. His pro- 
fessional loyalty, his lack of contact with other municipal 
interests, and his own professional ambitions are likely to 
result in requests that are excessive when measured against 
the city’s ability to pay and against other important civic 
requirements. 
8. It follows from the foregoing that, under the plan of 
fiscal independence of school boards, careful advance plan- 
ning of a city’s growth and development comes to a stand- 
still. A sound plan for future development involves the 
element of proportion. One department of civic activity 
must not advance ahead of all the others. But this element
-P-A-G-E-199
  CONTROL OF SCHOOL FINANCES 185 
of proportion is impossible of attainment when the schools 
are permitted to develop independently of all other civic 
interests. Whether the fault lies with the superintendent of _ 
schools or with the board of education, the result is the 
same. No consistent plan for symmetrical city develop- 
ment can be achieved; consequently, no such plan is likely 
to be fostered. 4 
4. It is a fundamental principle of good financial manage- 
ment, everywhere, that the persons who have in charge the 
spending of the funds should not have the final word in de- 
termining the budget. But this is exactly what occurs 
under the plan of fiscal independence. Ordinary business 
sagacity requires that the school board should be brought 
under the supervision of some external authority either in 
making up the budget, or in spending the funds, or in both. 
5. That the foregoing statements are not mere inferences 
but are modest statements of the facts is shown, it is main- 
tained, by the recorded extravagances of school boards and 
superintendents. Thus the mayor of a certain eastern city 
reports that “he found it possible to make a $16,000 reduc- 
tion in the cost of a $280,000 school building by eliminating 
unnecessary linings for ventilation flues and a superfluous 
heating system, both of which the board of education had 
approved.” The tendency toward extravagance thus il- 
lustrated is held to be an inevitable outcome of the school 
board’s lack of direct responsibility in the raising of funds. 
6. It is stated that, when they are financially independ- 
ent, school boards tend toward an unnecessary duplication 
of the work of other city agencies. The situation with re- 
spect to health supervision is a case in point. The number 
of school health departments, independently supported by 
school boards, is constantly growing in spite of a similar 
growth of city health departments. Where both depart- 
ments exist in the same city, as is common, there results an  
-P-A-G-E-200
  186 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE | 
unnecessarily heavy overhead expenditure, a duplication of 
effort, and frequent collision of authority with consequent 
unpleasantness. But, it is contended, if the school budget 
were to be viséed by the municipal authorities this particu- 
lar duplication, as well as others, would disappear. 
7. The municipal plan would make it possible to bring 
the schools into one codperative unit with all other city de- 
partments in the purchase of supplies. Here the obvious 
result would be the securing of more favorable terms for the 
purchases of all departments, and a consequent saving for 
both the city and the schools. 
8. The prevalent plan of financial independence, by set- 
ting the schools and school authorities apart, prevents the 
freest use of the school plant by the people of the city. A 
tremendous investment is thus prevented from yielding its 
fullest possible measure of service to those who maintain it. 
The municipal plan, it is held, would encourage a more 
liberal attitude on the part of the school custodians, if only 
that the schools might be sure of more liberal treatment in 
return. 
9. The history of developments in municipal organization 
is also pointed to in support of the proposed change. One 
important feature of these developments has been the 
abandonment of the plan of separate board control for fire 
protection, police protection, street development, ete. In- 
stead, all of these departments have been consolidated under 
a mayor and council, or, still more recently, under a board of 
commissioners or a city manager. Why, it is asked, should 
the schools longer seek to perpetuate for themselves a form 
of independence which in every other municipal activity 
has been declared unsatisfactory, and abandoned?! 
Frasier’s defense of fiscal independence. An effective

vember, 1922, p. 49.
-P-A-G-E-201
  CONTROL OF SCHOOL FINANCES “ee EBT 
defense of the traditional plan has been prepared by Frasier.* 
This writer’s defense includes, first, a summary of argu- 
ments, and second, the results of an objective study of the 
effects of the two plans upon the development of schools. 
The summary of arguments is as follows: 
1. The plan is right in principle. The point made here is 
that the school is not in fact a municipal department, like 
the fire department, police department, etc. It is a sepa- 
rate creature of the State, like the city itself. The usual 
territorial identity is a mere incident. The municipality 
and the school system are really separate entities. Fiscal 
independence is thus only a necessary corollary of actual 
independence. 
2. The plan involves no violation of the principles of taxa- 
tion, since the granting of taxation privileges is entirely at 
the option of the State. “Instead of two boards within the 
same city ‘competing for revenues,’ it is a case of two crea- 
tures of the State, within that State, collecting moneys for 
certain functions delegated to them by the State.” 
8. The plan works better in practice. This is shown not 
only by the author’s independent investigation, which is 
summarized below, but also by the fact that “there ig much 
more dissatisfaction in those cities in which the schools are 
fiscally dependent than in cities where the school system is 
fiscally independent. There is not only dissatisfaction 
among the school people but among the citizens of the city.” 
Frasier reaches this conclusion after a study of newspaper 
reports from cities of both classifications. 
4. The plan encourages the development of a continuous 
educational policy. This follows from the fact that the 
superintendent and school board, who formulate school 
policies, can look forward with comparative certainty to a 
stable income. A plan of educational development can thus 
1 Frasier, G. W.: The Control of City School Finance, pp. 65-87. Bruce 
Publishing Company, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
-P-A-G-E-202
TSS ps PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
  be carried out through successive stages running through a 
considerable period of time. 
5. The plan does not necessarily endanger the progress of 
the regular municipal departments. In the first place, the 
maximum tax rate for schools is usually fixed by State law. 
Secondly, the school board is responsible, if not to city 
officials, then at least to the same voters who have elected 
these city officers. In the long run these voters are bound 
to set the cost of schools over against the expenditures for 
municipal activities. Unwarranted extravagance on the 
part of a school board will thus meet with its due punish- 
ment in time. 
6. The plan “tends to keep politics out of the schools.” 
It is stated that “even those who are opposed to fiscal inde- 
pendence for city school systems do grant that the schools 
are influenced less by politics than are other political bodies. 
... This is a very valid reason why the schools should be 
under the control of an elected, non-political body that is 
fiscally independent.” 
But the most important part of Frasier’s study is doubtless 
his report of his own independent investigation. This con- 
sisted of an attempt to measure in objective terms the pro- 
gress made by schools operating under the plan of fiscal inde- 
pendence, as compared with that made by schools operating 
under the alternative plan. For this purpose he developed 
an “index number” to represent, in a single measure for each 
school system, its relative standing in all of the following 
matters: (1) Per cent of sixteen- and seventeen-year-old 
children in school; (2) per cent of elementary classes having 
fewer than forty children enrolled; (3) per cent of children 
having sixty or more square feet of playground space; (4) 
per cent of teachers having six or more years of training 
above the eighth grade; (5) “per cent of children enrolled 
who attend school all day, and in adequate buildings owned
-P-A-G-E-203
  CONTROL OF SCHOOL FINANCES 189 
by the city”’; and (6) “the per cent of the increased cost of 
living from 1913-14 to 1919-20 that was met by increased 
salaries for elementary women teachers.” ‘The details of 
the elaboration of this index number are presented in full by 
the author, but need not be gone into here. 
The proper index number was found for each one of the 
school systems in one hundred and sixty-nine cities, includ- 
ing seventy-one in which the schools were dependent in 
financial matters, and ninety-eight in which they were in- 
dependently organized. Comparison of these index num- 
bers shows that “no city having a fiscally dependent school 
system surpasses the third quartile” of the group of inde- 
pendent systems. “The correlation between fiscal de- 
pendence and the index numbers was found to be — .28. 
... There is a distinet tendency for fiscally independent 
school systems to have higher index numbers than fiscally 
dependent systems. ‘This holds true for cities of different 
size and geographical location.” 
If one accepts Frasier’s index number as a true criterion 
of educational efficiency, then there can be little doubt that 
fiscal independence makes for school progress. The answer 
of opponents would probably be that there has been no 
corresponding measure of general municipal progress. Thus 
the question is finally reduced back to whether the schools 
are properly to be considered as mere municipal activities. 
Here the answer of both history and the courts appears to 
be a decided negative. 
The Educational Finance Inquiry Report. A still more 
elaborate investigation of this problem has been completed 
by Dr. J. R. McGaughy, under the general direction of the 
Educational Finance Inquiry Commission. McGaughy’s 
study is based upon detailed data from three hundred 
and seventy-seven American cities. Classification of these
-P-A-G-E-204
  190 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
cities according to dependence or independence of school 
boards in fiscal matters, and according to size and regional 
location, brought out the interesting fact that the dependent 
type of organization is more frequent in Eastern cities and in 
cities of over one hundred thousand population. The study 
also developed a specialized technique for comparing aver- 
ages and medians, known as the “critical ratio.” 
This critical ratio is the ratio of the difference in the averages of 
the two groups of cities (independent and dependent) on any item 
(tax rates, for example) to the Probable Error of the difference on 
that item. If this ratio has a value of three or more, it is regarded 
as significant. 
The different comparisons made, the superiority or. in- 
feriority of dependent or independent organizations with 
reference to each comparison, and the respective critical 
ratios involved, all appear in Table XV, taken from the

“CONTROL OF SCHOOL FINANCES 193 
Cities of the independent type are thus seen to lead in 
nine of the fourteen “financial factors,” and in four of the 
five “educational factors.” An important financial con- 
clusion not evident in this summary, however, is that “a 
city’s average expense per pupil is in no way affected by the 
fact of the independence or dependence of its board of educa- 
tion with respect to the municipal authority of that city.”! 
Either type of city is as generous as the other in the matter 
of total per-pupil expenditure for schools. Independent 
organization, however, tends to promote capital outlays 
and school indebtedness, with resulting increased adequacy 
of buildings and play-ground space. Dependent organiza- 
tion appears to encourage large expenditures for instruction, 
and to hold a larger percentage of trained teachers in the 
school system. 
A caution. In this controversy there has been encount- 
ered an issue upon which wholly respectable authorities 
clearly may differ in opinion. If one assumes that the 
schools are, or ought to be, municipal activities, and that the 
balanced development of the whole municipality is prefer- 
able to a condition of superiority in schools and inferiority 
in other departments, there certainly is much to be said for 
the plan of fiscal dependence. If on the contrary one con- 
siders education to be a state function not connected with 
other local functions, and more important than any or all of 
the regular municipal activities, then the necessity for fiscal 
independence must virtually be conceded. That education 
is a State rather than a local function seems now to be an 
established principle in the United States, and that it is of 
paramount importance is the judgment of nearly every 
educator. It is inevitable, therefore, that the consensus of 
opinion among educators should favor the independence 
of school authorities in fiscal matters. 
1 McGaughy, J. R., op. cit., p. 30.
-P-A-G-E-208
  194 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE | 
It does not follow, however, that school authorities are 
justified in pursuing their own sweet will regardless of other 
civic needs. It is doubtful if they often do that. It is cer- 
tain, however, that a school board which continues to pile up 
expenditures for schools, even although remaining always 
within the legal tax limit, to the manifest detriment of 
streets, parks, public health, and other city services, will 
face in the end an embarrassing reaction. Not only that, 
but it will have added to the very considerable sentiment 
already existing in favor of fiscal dependence for schools. 
Whatever the theory in the matter, the privileges of inde- 
pendence will not always be extended to authorities who 
wantonly abuse them. 
The board and its executive officers. The discussion to 
this point has shown that, although the responsibilities of 
school boards are far-reaching, these boards are circum- 
scribed in their actions by State laws and limitations, by 
district reservations, and frequently by the supervision in 
budgetary matters of local city and county officers. These 
inroads into the activities of boards all come from outside 
the school. Now, however, we are about to take up an- 
other large subtraction from their functions which is due to 
the appearance of a group of specialized managerial officers 
within the school organization. Chief among these new 
officials are the school business manager and the superin- 
tendent of schools. 
The superintendent, it will be recalled, holds little or no 
direct responsibility to the district which he serves. The 
same thing is true of the school business manager. From 
the district’s standpoint both are employees of the board, 
and the board is responsible to the district for their actions 
as well as for its own. There is to-day evidence of a tend- 
ency to identify the city superintendent as a State educa- 
tional officer, responsible in some particulars directly to the
-P-A-G-E-209
  CONTROL OF SCHOOL FINANCES. 195 
State department of education. This recognition bestows 
upon the superintendent certain definite powers and duties, 
in the execution of which he may act independently of local 
board control, but in the main, and particularly in financial 
matters, the duty of both the superintendent and the busi- 
ness manager is to bring their expert knowledge and experi- 
ence to the aid of the board of education. 
Historically speaking, and speaking in general terms, 
these executive positions were created by school boards for 
their own assistance and relief, just as the board itself was 
established by the district to discharge duties that the dis- 
trict found inconvenient or impracticable. 
General underlying principles. We do not lose sight of 
the fact that this book is concerned with school finance, but 
the relations existing between the school board and its ex- 
ecutives in the management of finance are of a piece with 
their relations in all other respects, with the exception that 
the board’s direct responsibilities are possibly somewhat 
greater in the financial field. A brief statement of the gen- 
eral principles underlying the larger relations existing be- 
tween these parties will therefore explain to a considerable 
degree their financial relations. 
The activities involved in school control have been classi- 
fied into three types.1. One of these — the legislative — 
has to do with the consideration and adoption of all new 
policies or changes in policy for the school. Any activity 
which culminates in a positive or negative vote of the board 
of education may be classified as a legislative act. The sec- 
ond type is known as the executive type, and embraces all 
activities involved in putting the board’s legislative enact- 
ments into force in the school system. Inspectorial activi- 
ties comprise the thir class. These include everything that 
is required to determine whether or not the will of the legis- 
1See Bobbitt, F., in the Denver School Survey, Part L.  
-P-A-G-E-210
  196 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
lating body has been properly executed. The board is gen- 
erally regarded as the responsible body for legislating and in- 
specting, while the executive officers alone are responsible 
for executing. However, these officers are expected to ad- 
vise the board in all its legislation and to assist it in all of its 
inspection. Similarly, the board should be admitted into 
the advisory confidence of its appointed officers in executive 
concerns. 
Wherever school financial management involves legis- 
lative action, then, the responsibility is with the board, and 
the right of advising is with its executive officers. Thus the 
budget can receive legal sanction only by legislative action 
of the board, but the board should take no action on budget- 
ary matters without advice from the superintendent and 
business manager. The same relationship holds in the in- 
spection and official endorsement of financial acts after their 
completion, except that these officers usually perform the 
actual inspection required and report their findings to the 
board. The board’s customary procedure is to approve 
or disapprove these findings. In the administration of all 
financial legislation, on the other hand, the executive officers 
should be given free rein, and should then be held completely 
responsible for securing the desired results. 
In one respect at least the foregoing statement may ap- 
pear to be defective. It is rather generally held that the 
executive officers should not merely advise their controlling 
boards on legislative questions, but that they should actually 
initiate all new legislation before the board. The board is 
thus restricted to voting affirmatively or negatively on the 
proposals of its administrative officers. 
No doubt the work of advising the board would frequently 
take the form of initiating action. Certainly, also, a school 
board ought never to try to force through important legis- 
lation against the advice of its executive officers. This self-
-P-A-G-E-211
CONTROL OF SCHOOL FINANCES 197 
control should be exercised with especial care in the case of 
definitely educational policies, concerning courses of study, 
equipment, employment of teachers, and the like. But no 
relationship would seem wise which would convert the school 
board into a mere rubber-stamping machine. There is 
danger that this might occur if the executives adopt the 
practice of coming to board meeting with a bundle of new 
policies under each arm, and with their satchels filled with 
arguments and evidence, while the board members are left 
without any advance information of the actions that may 
be contemplated. This picture is extreme, but not entirely 
misleading as to fact. It would seem that an executive 
officer’s initiation of new policies of procedure should be 
more gradual, and should involve a considerable period 
spent in “give and take” discussion with his board. For 
this reason it is possible better to consider his position with 
respect to new legislation as advisory; but, on the other 
hand, the board of education should treat the advice of a 
competent executive officer with the greatest seriousness, as 
coming from one who is especially qualified. 
The superintendent and the business manager. In the 
section just concluded the discussion centered around the 
division of functions between the school board and its ex- 
ecutive officers. For a village or small city school system, 
where the only important executive officer is the superin- 
tendent of schools, the discussion there given will suffice. 
But in the larger city systems there are frequently several 
executive departmental heads in addition to the superin- 
tendent of schools. Among these, the one of especial im- 
portance for consideration here is the school business man- 
ager. This officer’s position is of importance, first, because 
his relations to the superintendent are now matters of con- 
troversy, and second, because the so-called “business as- 
pects” of management are of particular concern to the 
student of local school finance.

The duties and responsibilities of the modern school busi- 
ness manager have been described by one writer! thus: 
In cities of 100,000 population and under this official has charge 
of the entire business division of the board of education. To the 
school business manager is assigned the duty of keeping a complete 
set of books or accounts and an itemized record of all income and 
expenditures. He will have charge of all legal documents and 
other valuable papers. He will function as the secretary of a 
corporation, and with the president will sign all deeds, contracts, 
notes, bonds, salary vouchers, and other necessary official docu- 
ments. He handles the purchase and distribution of all school 
supplies. Under close direction of the board he acts as its financial 
agent, issues all warrants for the payment of regular employees and 
for all labor and material furnished. He is assigned the duty of 
approving all requisitions for supplies and materials, and of classify- 
ing and recording all expenditures of whatsoever kind. He will 
report fully and as otherwise required to his board, at each regular 
and special meeting, all matters of purely business concern, and 
will carry into execution all orders of the board relative thereunto. 
Between meetings of the board all business transactions shall be 
made exclusively through him. 
The school business manager will be responsible for the organiza- 
tion and conduct of the business office. He will select his clerks, 
book-keepers, and all other employees of his department. He will 
have authority to manage the affairs of his office in such a way that 
the business of the school system shall be conducted honestly. 
economically, and efficiently. He will be firmly bound to carry out 
the will of the board as expressed in board meetings. He will have 
definite powers and prerogatives, and be Hele strictly accountable 
for his acts as an executive. 
This statement appears to imply that practically all re- 
sponsibility for the details of local financial management are 
vested in the school business manager. Practices differ; but 
where such an official exists in the school system, this local- 
ization of business functions very commonly obtains. The 
business manager is very naturally expected to manage the 
business affairs of the school system.

CONTROL OF SCHOOL FINANCES 199 
The only serious controversial question is: Should the 
business manager, in the discharge of his multifarious activi- 
ties, be directly responsible to the superintendent of schools, 
or to the board of education? Should he be regarded as 
subordinate to or codrdinate with the superintendent? The 
two plans of organization into which this question leads are 
presented in the next section. 
The “ dual” and “ unit” plans of administrative organiza- 
tion. The controversy just referred to revolves around the 
“dual” plan versus the “unit” plan of school administrative 
organization. Under the dual plan the superintendent and 
the business manager are regarded as codrdinate, and inde- 
pendent of each other except for such voluntary codperation 
as can be obtained. One is head of the educational depart- 
ment and the other is head of the business department, and 
both have direct access and are directly responsible to the 
school board. Under this plan the business manager would 
take the lead in budget-making, and would keep the financial 
records and make the financial reports under no other direc- 
tion than such as he receives from the board. 
The unit plan, on the other hand, places the superintend- 
ent in charge, under the board of education, of all of the 
activities of the school system. The business manager is 
subordinate to him, and responsible to him rather than to 
the board directly. This plan would make the superintend- 
ent the responsible officer in budget-making, and would put 
the accounting and reporting activities of the business 
manager under the superintendent’s supervision and care. 
The business manager would thus become a specialized 
assistant to the superintendent of schools. 
Arguments for the dual plan. No satisfactory informa- 
tion has been found regarding the relative frequency of these 
two plans in American cities. Nor has any objective study 
of their relative efficiency been encountered, such as Fra- 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
  200° PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
sier’s and McGaughy’s studies of fiscal dependence versus 
fiscal independence of school boards. A profitable line of 
investigation is suggested at this point. In consequence of 
these gaps in the literature of the subject, the present argu- 
ments in defense of both plans are largely theoretical, al- 
though their practical consequences as shown in the history 
of certain cities are mentioned in some of the school surveys. 
The dual plan seems to have for its principal defenders 
the school business managers themselves. Superintend- 
ents, and other professional educators, on the other hand, 
seem almost unanimously to oppose it. The fact that the 
plan is found in fairly frequent operation, however, suggests 
that it must have a considerable number of supporters in the 
general public, or at least among school board members. 
One line of argument advanced in support of the dual 
plan is that both the educational and the business sides of 
school administration in large cities have grown to the ex- 
tent that no one man can possibly administer them both. 
On the one hand it is urged that the superintendent of schools 
should be relieved of every responsibility not directly educa- 
tional in nature. For him to dabble in the business affairs 
of the school, it is held, will necessarily mean a less attentive 
and less efficient discharge of the work for which he is 
peculiarly responsible. On the other hand it is maintained 
that the training and experience of the superintendent of 
schools are such as to unfit him even to supervise the activi- 
ties of a really efficient business manager. 
A second line of argument leading to the same conclusion 
stresses the need for specialization in the field of school 
business management. So large and so important has this 
work become, in the larger cities, that it is imperative that 
the head of these activities should rank as highly in his field 
as the school superintendent ranks in his. If the position 
of business manager be made subordinate in rank to the posi-
-P-A-G-E-215
  
CONTROL OF SCHOOL FINANCES 201 
tion of superintendent, in the long run the men secured for 
the position will be inferior men. In other words, a man of 
first-class ability and business training will not accept, as 
a rule, a position of subordination to a man who is not a 
business man primarily. Were he to do so, it is held, he 
would seldom be able to render his best service, because his 
actions would be subject to review by a man not qualified to 
understand them. 
Arguments for the unit plan. A leading argument of those 
who support the unit plan for school organization is that the 
school itself is a unit and not a duality in fact. It exists for 
one purpose, not for two. The one objective of its existence 
is the educational service of boys and girls. ‘ Its objective is 
not a business objective. Inasmuch as its business activities 
are in fact subordinate to its educational objective, its busi- 
ness department should be subordinated to its educational 
department. Ordinary business standards ought not to 
prevail in determining school business policies, or in judging 
of the efficiency of school business management. Rather, 
the efficiency of the business department should be judged 
by the extent to which it serves and promotes educational 
ends. Such a viewpoint requires that the head of the busi- 
ness department should be regarded as a specialized assistant 
to the superintefident of schools. Only in this way, it is 
contended, can the department be made to serve effectively 
the ends of education. 
If the departments are administered separately, it is 
maintained, the business affairs will be conducted too largely 
from the standpoint of achieving financial economies, with- 
out adequate recognition of the needs of the schools. This 
tendency would result from at least three causes. First, it 
is natural for a business man, such as the business manager 
would and should be, to emphasize “business” principles. 
The cost of education is likely to loom larger in the mind of 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
    202 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
such a man than is the educational result to be achieved. 
Second, there is the natural ambition of the business agent 
to make a reputation for himself, which can best be done by 
“saving money.” Any addition which he might make to 
the educational efficiency of the school system would be as 
likely to redound to the superintendent’s glory as to his own. 
His interest would, therefore, lie in cramping the educational 
department within limits determined by strictly business 
economies. It is not maintained that every school business 
manager would yield to this impulse, but rather that the 
natural tendency of his position, if independent, would be in 
this direction. In the third place, it is asserted that in case 
of conflict between the superintendent and the business 
manager, the natural inclination of most school boards would 
be to support the business manager. This inclination, it is 
said, would result from the fact that board members are 
likely to be business men themselves, and thus better able 
to understand the business man’s viewpoint. In the dual 
system of organization, therefore, the business manager is 
likely to force financial economies ahead of educational 
necessities, and to secure the support of the board of educa- 
tion in so doing. 
Another argument for the unit plan is to the effect that 
a dual system cannot in fact be set up»and maintained. 
Either the educational must have the authority to control 
the business department, or the business department will 
actually control the educational. Educational matters are 
largely dependent upon financial considerations. He who 
controls the finances of the school in reality controls its 
educational activities. A form of organization, therefore, 
which sets the business manager up as coérdinate with the 
superintendent really subordinates the latter to the former. 
In other words, the so-called “dual” system is really a 
“unit” system with the business department in control.
-P-A-G-E-217
  CONTROL OF SCHOOL FINANCES 203 
In the Grand Rapids Survey Report, Rugg has summarized 
(pp. 443-45) the results of the dual plan as exhibited by 
conditions in that city. He states first that the business de- 
partment and the educational department have tended to 
grow apart, with a consequent lack of vital codperation. 
This divergence is the result of the desire of the educational 
department to use money and of the business department 
to save it. Again, he finds that the accounting methods of 
the city are designed chiefly to show receipts and disburse- 
ments, rather than to throw light on educational problems. 
Many pertinent types of cost data are missing. In the third 
place, the budget appears to be worked out by the business 
department on business principles, without adequate con- 
sideration of the wants of the educational department. 
Fourthly, the board of education in Grand Rapids has per- 
mitted an overdevelopment of the physical and business 
aspects of the school organization, in comparison with the 
educational side. Finally, the system has produced a type 
of dual school reporting, in which the financial items are 
not properly correlated with the educational items. Rugg 
summarizes by saying that “it may be questioned whether 
the school system is not being administered educationally 
by one officer on educational principles, and from the busi- 
ness standpoint by another officer on business principles.” 
Coéperation the vital need. The preceding sections have 
shown the existence of a considerable variation in both 
principles and practices regarding the localization of finan- 
cial powers and responsibilities among the different school 
officials. Opinions and practices differ regarding the proper 
legal status of the business manager and the superintendent, 
of the school board and its executive officers, of the school 
board and regular city officials, and of the board in relation 
to the district and to the State. Amidst all of these varia- 
tions, however, certain tendencies toward a definite place-
-P-A-G-E-218
    204 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
ment of financial powers and responsibilities are gradually 
making themselves felt. 
It can hardly be disputed that certain forms of school 
administrative organization are superior to others, or that 
certain school officers can perform certain financial functions 
more effectively than other officers can perform them. 
There is doubtless a “best way” to dispose of each of the 
problems and difficulties that have been raised in this 
chapter. But it is well in conclusion to stress the fact that 
there is something still more important than the form of the 
organization for financial management of schools. This 
more important thing is a spirit of confidence and mutual 
codperation. 
If every officer concerned with the management of school 
finance can be filled with the spirit of codperation with every 
other officer concerned with the same business, for the 
accomplishment of strictly educational ends — a difficult 
thing to secure, no doubt — more could be accomplished in 
the way of securing adequate returns for the money spent 
for schools than could ever be accomplished by any plan of 
organization without that spirit. The most profitable test 
to apply to any proposed organization is whether or not it 
may be expected to promote this codperative spirit, and to 
diminish the spirit of jealous rivalry among officials. What- 
ever their legal relations, the superintendent and the busi- 
ness manager must work in unison to the end that school 
expenditures may produce the largest educational returns. 
School boards should recognize the fact that the schools are 
not the only important lines of public service which must be 
paid for out of available tax revenues. They should coéper- 
ate voluntarily to secure a properly balanced growth among 
all public institutions and activities. The board and its 
chief executives likewise should codperate intelligently, each 
welcoming wholesome advice and helpful assistance from
-P-A-G-E-219
  CONTROL OF SCHOOL FINANCES 205 
the others. Their time and energy should not be wasted 
in jealous bickering over their relative prerogatives and 
powers. To the extent to which a definition and precise 
placement of financial powers and responsibilities will help 
to promote this codperative spirit it is to be commended, 
but it should be discouraged whenever it tends to isolate 
responsibilities, and to separate the various members of the 
school administrative personnel into independent and jeal- 
ous units. 
Chapter summary. One important aspect of local finan- 
cial management is that of identifying the various persons 
and groups who must participate in that management, and 
of defining the functions of each. More specifically, the 
problem of this chapter has been to determine the place in 
school financial management of the State, the school dis- 
trict, the board of education, the city and county officers, 
the superintendent of schools, and the school business man- 
ager. 
In the course of the chapter we have discovered an ap- 
proach to agreement on certain points, and a condition of 
uncertainty and even of controversy on several others. It 
seems to be agreed, for example, that the school board is 
responsible to the district for the performance of all financial 
functions not definitely reserved to the district or to the 
State. It is also agreed that the carrying out of financial 
policies in administrative action should be delegated by the 
board to its executive specialists. It is generally agreed 
that these executive specialists should have at least advisory 
powers in determining the financial policies of the school. 
It is agreed that the business manager, where he exists, 
should be directly in charge of most of the details of finan- 
cial administration. 
Some doubtful or controversial issues are as follows: 
Just how far should the State and district go in delegating
-P-A-G-E-220
  206 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
financial powers and responsibilities to the board of educa- 
tion? Just how far should the board go in its turn in dele- 
gating its powers and responsibilities to its executive special- 
ists? That there should be a large amount of delegated 
authority in both instances is practically conceded, but the 
exact amount, and its details, is still unsettled. Again, ought 
school boards to be dependent upon or independent of other 
fiscal authorities? And ought the superintendent of schools’ 
to be merely an educational executive, or ought he to be the 
coérdinating center for all departments of the school or- 
ganization, including the business department? For these 
questions professional educators have evolved very definite 
answers, to the effect that school boards should be financially 
independent of other public officers, and that the superin- 
tendent of schools should be the responsible head under the 
board of education of the business as well as of the educa- 
tional department. The school business manager should be 
a specialized assistant to the superintendent of schools. 
Finally, it has been suggested that every phase and detail 
of this problem of defining and placing the various school 
financial functions should be judged by its effect upon co- 
operation between the different parties involved for strictly 
educational ends. Any change or development in the or- 
ganization of the staff which will increase cobperation and 
decrease rivalry and misunderstanding should be hastened 
to fulfillment. The greatest care should be exercised, 
though, that this definition and placement of financial 
functions is not carried so far that isolated and independent 
agencies of management are set up side by side. The essen- 
tial thing is to secure codperation and common understand- 
ing among all who participate in the financial management 
of the school.

TOPICS FOR INVESTIGATION AND DISCUSSION 
. How could the methods employed by Frasier and McGaughy in their 
study of the relative efficiency of the dependent and independent 
fiscal organization of city school boards be applied to the study of the 
“unit” versus the “dual” plan of school administrative organization? 
Analyze the fiscal organization of some city school system of your 
acquaintance, preferably one in which you have served or now are 
serving. What is its status with reference to the problems raised in 
this chapter? What criticisms of its organization can you make in the 
light of this chapter? 
From McGaughy’s summary table, do you conclude that fiscal inde- 
pendence or fiscal dependence is the preferable condition for school 
boards in cities? Explain your choice. 
Ought the fiscal organization of a city school system to be decided 
from the standpoint of what is best for the schools or what is best for 
the whole city? What light does your answer to this question throw 
upon the problems raised in this chapter?

  CHAPTER VIII 
FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF SCHOOL PUBLICITY 
Purpose of this chapter. One important aspect of the 
modern movement in education comprises various activities 
which, taken together, make up what is coming to be known 
as “school publicity.” As in budget-making, financial 
accounting, comparisons of unit-costs, and the other phases 
of local financial management discussed above, so here we 
have, in part at least, a borrowing from the commercial 
field. In part, school publicity represents a carrying over 
into educational affairs of modern developments in com- 
mercial advertising, but in part, also, it is merely an exten- 
sion of the idea that has always lain, more or less definitely, 
behind the published reports of school boards and superin- 
tendents. The modern movement joins to the purpose of 
the old annual School Report, that of rendering an account 
of stewardship, the new purpose which dominates commer- 
cial advertising, that of making a commodity so attractive 
that it appears indispensable to those who must be its con- 
sumers. In education, however, the publicist has an ad- 
vantage not always enjoyed by the commercial advertiser, 
in that his commodity, education, is in fact indispensable, 
and his duty is merely to make this truth evident to every 
one. 
On its financial side, school publicity presents two pro- 
blems for solution. One is to determine the extent to which 
school authorities should go in rendering to the public their 
accounts of stewardship and the best forms which these 
accounts may take. The second problem is to determine 
the most effective means for representing to the public the 
needs of the schools, in order that the taxpayers shall respond
-P-A-G-E-224
  210 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
with more willing and generous support. To account for 
funds already expended, and to secure increased funds for 
enlarging needs, these are the main purposes of school finan- 
cial publicity. Being its main purposes, they also define its 
outstanding large problems. 
Need for financial publicity. The needed amount of finan- 
cial support for public schools cannot be provided by the 
board and superintendent alone. Back of these officers 
there must exist willing codperation on the part of the com- 
munity. Even a temporary increase in revenues will require 
public support, and certainly any permanent raising of the 
level of school expenditures must be preceded or accompa- 
nied by an education of the people into an understanding of 
the reasons for the change and a belief that these reasons are 
conclusive. Without this process of public education a 
temporary increase in school expenditures is very likely to 
be followed by a period of reaction and retrenchment. 
This condition has been true ever since schools became 
publicly supported institutions, but the need for educa- 
tional publicity to offset it has been increased in consequence 
of the World War. One feature of this trying period was the 
repeated drive for funds which has left the public in a state 
of mind requiring such organized stimulation to produce a 
concerted response. 
The idea contained in the phrase, “financial publicity,” 
is sometimes expressed by the words, “selling the schools.” 
In so far as this phrase suggests the necessity of making the 
schools desirable to the public and worthy of their support, 
it is acceptable, but in so far as it suggests exaggeration, or 
even the making of misleading statements, it should not be 
tolerated by responsible school-men. In the quotation which 
follows there appear not only excellent criticisms of this very 
common expression, but also several suggestions regarding 
the right sort of educational publicity. 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
  SCHOOL PUBLICITY 211 
Who has not heard this gem, “sell your schools”? ... How well 
the phrase sounds! It really has the din of the market; indeed, it 
is quite urbane in its intonations. It smells of gasoline, that 
olfactory adjunct of modern progress. It has the flashing smile 
of the young lady at the neck-tie counter. Just sell your schools! 
How perfectly obvious! ... 
Emerson was probably wrong and no doubt out of date when he 
said: “Let one produce something worth while and the public will 
wear a path to his door if his workshop be in the middle of a forest.” 
Perhaps all the world wants now is to be sonorously entertained 
while it is being sold; all we need to do is to titillate the risibilities 
of the indulgent and gullible public to put across a sale. The crux 
of the matter is that this high-sounding slogan fails to emphasize 
the fact that quality is of vastly more moment than merely putting 
across a sale. ‘The trade cunning and semi-hypnotic influence 
necessary to sell a gold brick does not fit in very smugly with the 
ideal of service which must ever be the true basis of the work of the 
schools.*   
In their excellent book on the subject of school publicity, 
Alexander and Theisen have summarized the needs for 
financial publicity in the following terms: 
1. It offers the only sure way to insure increased support to the 
extent needed. 
2. It offers the only sure way to prevent a back fire or reaction 
after increased support has been voted by the board. 
8. It offers the only sure way to secure and keep the confidence 
of the people in the board and superintendent of schools. 
4. It provides an opportunity to educate the people in the needs 
and purposes of the schools and to stimulate public discussion. 
5. It enables the school authorities to feel the pulse of the public 
which they represent and serve. 
Types of financial publicity. Financial publicity, as at 
present conducted, is of two leading types. Of these types, 
the first from the standpoint of historical development was 
the financial report. The beginnings of these reports from

education at least one hundred years. This form of public- 
ity, however, has never become very effective, but has re- 
mained formal and uninviting where it has not been actually 
unintelligible. The second type has come into prominence 
more recently and takes the form of a financial campaign or 
drive. Such a drive usually has as its objective the securing 
of funds for some definite purpose, such as to finance a new 
building program, or to secure some specialized equipment, 
or for raising the school tax rate, etc. This specific purpose 
is usually so important as to stimulate very careful planning 
and execution in carrying through the drive. As a result 
educationists have been forced to study the methods and 
devices which have proved effective in commercial adver- 
tising, and in the tremendous drives carried on by the na- 
tional government during the War. It is to the second of 
these types of publicity, therefore, that we must turn if we 
would study the most effective means now available in this 
field. 
Each of these publicity types has its peculiar advantages 
and disadvantages. ‘The first is distinguished particularly 
by its regularity, coming annually as it usually does. It is 
weak, however, in the crude and uninteresting form which 
it usually takes; that is to say, in its dependence upon finan- 
cial statistics without explanations or graphical interpreta- 
tions. The second type of publicity is strong in the methods 
and devices used for the sake of clearness and persuasive- 
ness, but is weak in that it is irregular or sporadic. Ideal 
publicity will be approached when to the regularity of the 
first type there has been joined the attractiveness and force 
of the second. 
The financial campaign or drive. The discussion in this 
chapter must be directed chiefly to the financial campaign 
or drive. The reason for this emphasis is that, as has been 
said, this type of publicity best illustrates modern trends in 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
  SCHOOL PUBLICITY 218 
the field. Publicity, whether regular or occasional, will be 
effective just to the extent that it recognizes the psychologi- 
cal laws governing the situation. The old time school report 
paid little or no attention to the popular psychology. It is 
only in the newer movement that we find emphasis given to 
this matter. 
“Tn the long run,” say Alexander and Theisen,! “when- 
ever any considerable increase in school support is to be 
asked, the safest and most profitable course is to conduct a 
publicity campaign, or at least a campaign of education.” 
These campaigns are conducted, therefore, chiefly to ac- 
complish certain specific ends. Fortunately, however, the 
full benefit of such a campaign is not measured by the suc- 
cess or failure of the specific purpose for which it was or- 
ganized. If it has been properly directed, a publicity cam- 
paign should leave with the public an understanding of its 
schools and an appreciation of their services which extend 
far beyond the original objective. 
Not all publicity campaigns have been confined to finan- 
cial objectives, but such have been the purposes of a large 
proportion of them. Whether, however, the purpose of the 
campaign is financial or not, the general plan of its organiza- 
tion and the principles to be recognized in its conduct are 
much the same. It is appropriate, therefore, to summarize 
in this chapter the outstanding characteristics of modern 
educational campaigns. 
In this discussion we have drawn from the work on Pub- 
licity Campaigns for Better School Support, by Carter Alex- 
anderand W. W. Theisen. These authors— in particularthe 
first — have probably done more than any others to develop 
the field of educational publicity. Not only have their

findings been utilized in the preparation of this chapter, 
but, because of its superiority to anything else of its kind, 
their organization of the materials in the field has also been 
adopted. 
A summary involves the discussion of five specific points. 
First must be considered the personnel of the campaign; i.e., 
the kinds of people who should participate in it, and how 
they should be organized to secure the greatest result. 
Second must be considered the means and instruments 
which can be used by these people in order to get their pro- 
ject and the reasons for it clearly and effectively before the 
public. 
In the third place, the motives which are likely to domi- 
nate the public to which the appeal is to be made must be 
considered, and a choice made of the motives which are most 
likely to function in the particular case. 
The fourth consideration concerns the materials, in the 
forms of facts, statistics, illustrations, etc., which are avail- 
able for the purpose. 
Finally, it is necessary to review the general principles 
governing the action of the survey personnel in its choice and 
use of materials, instruments, and motives. 
Personnel. It is recommended that a campaign staff 
should be organized around a general manager, who should 
be assisted by a campaign committee and a corps of expert 
assistants. At least at the start, the general manager would 
preferably be the superintendent. Two types of managers 
are discussed in the literature. One may be described as 
the “out-in-the-open” leader, while the other is a director 
who works behind the scenes. Some men would be more 
successful as leaders, while others would be more successful 
as directors. The choice must be left to the man himself. 
If the superintendent is acting as general manager, it is prob- 
ably better for him to adopt the policies of a director behind
-P-A-G-E-229
  SCHOOL PUBLICITY 215 
the scenes rather than those of a leader in the open. A 
superintendent should not come to be regarded by his public 
primarily as a solicitor for funds. He should rather seek 
recognition as an educational specialist. Moreover, the 
animosities engendered in a heated campaign are liable to 
affect his influence in the community adversely, and may 
even threaten the security of his tenure of office. It is also 
to be remembered that the public will often listen favorably 
to financial appeals when made by some prominent layman, 
where they would be disposed to disparage a superintend- 
ent’s appeals on the ground that he had too much personal 
interest in the movement. 
A campaign committee, advisory to the general manager, 
has been provided for in many large financial campaigns. 
In addition to advising the manager, this committee, if di- 
vided into subcommittees, will often give him very definite 
specialized help; and the committee as a whole can stand 
as a buffer between the school authorities and the public. 
“Tn general, two types of persons are needed for the com- 
mittee — those who are skilled in doing things and those 
who can influence certain groups of people.” 
Expert assistants, selected by the manager or committee 
or board, will prove very helpful in campaigns where large 
amounts of money are involved and where authentic facts, 
organized and presented in the most favorable form, will 
constitute an important factor in the success of the enter- 
prise. 
In campaigns of lesser moment, or in towns and smaller 
cities, the school board may serve as the advisory committee 
and the principal or superintendent as the manager. ‘This 
should be the arrangement everywhere with respect to 
general or continuous publicity. A board and superintend- 
ent, accustomed to conducting properly their regular public- 
ity, could very readily function as manager and committee 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
216 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
for a special campaign of minor dimensions. This frequent 
necessity for the superintendent’s taking charge of publicity 
activities emphasizes the need for real educational leader- 
ship on his part. Says Cook: “Leadership of.the highest or- 
der is needed to arouse and inform public opinion, in towns 
and cities, as well as in rural communities, concerning the 
needs of the schools and how these needs should be met.” 
The bearing of this matter becomes evident when one con- 
siders the lack of professional training that is characteristic 
of county superintendents, and of the superintendents of 
towns and villages in many sections of the United States. 
So long as there is a lack of expert professional administra- 
tion in these places, publicity for financial expansions will be 
generally of an inferior type. 
In large campaigns, the manager, committee, and group 
of expert workers will need to be supplemented by other 
groups of workers chosen from the general public. These 
workers should include representatives from as many groups 
of the body politic as possible — newspaper workers, min- 
isters, doctors, representatives from mothers’ clubs, from 
labor organizations, from civic clubs, etc. — all of whom 
should be welded together into one harmoniously codperat- 
ing body. Also teachers, principals, and children can be 
utilized to great advantage in circulating information in the 
homes and in preparing materials for the press. ‘The Boy 
Scouts and Camp Fire Girls have proved of great service in 
some places. These representatives of the general public 
outside the school are especially helpful on the day of elec- 
tion in helping to get out a representative vote. 
Means or instruments. In the book to which reference 
has already been made the following means or instruments 
of publicity are listed and discussed: public meetings, the 
press, advertising, demonstrations and exhibits of school 
work, personal campaigning, school surveys, visits to schools,
-P-A-G-E-231
  SCHOOL PUBLICITY 217 
endorsements of school work and policies by persons of in- 
fluence, letters and post cards, petitions, advanced polling of 
voters, and printed instructions and announcements to 
voters. A considerable overlapping of items is apparent in 
this list. Also, there is a lack of codrdination. The list has 
been compiled, however, from the means or instruments re- 
ported as actually used in educational campaigns. It is 
impracticable to discuss all of these instruments here. The 
reader is referred to the book itself for a more complete dis- 
cussion of them. However, it will be worth our while to 
consider briefly a few of the instruments here listed. 
Two kinds of meetings may be utilized in a school finan- 
cial campaign. First, campaign meetings may be arranged. 
Second, advantage may be taken of other meetings to pre- 
sent the purposes and arguments of the campaign. The 
second type of meeting is probably more effective than the 
first, if care is used in taking advantage of it. People can be 
reached through this second type who would not attend 
meetings called specifically for the discussion of the cam- 
paign, and it is the people who are uninterested that the 
campaign committee should be most anxious to reach. The 
choice of competent speakers to appear before these meet- 
ings is as important as the choice of the meetings themselves, 
and supplying the speakers with appropriate data is as im- 
portant as choosing them. Frequently, the most effective 
speakers are not the best informed about the facts under- 
lying the campaign, while the people who have the informa- 
tion are not effective speakers. The information assembled 
by the expert assistants, to whom reference has been made 
above, should therefore be made available for the corps of 
speakers. 
It is also important for speakers, in addressing other 
meetings than those called for campaign purposes, to use 
tact in introducing this unusual subject, and to refrain from, 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  218 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
trespassing too largely upon the patience of their hearers. 
Audiences at picture shows and other places of entertain- 
ment are very likely to resent the intrusion even of school 
subjects, unless the matter is handled tactfully. 
The press offers three opportunities for publicity appeals 
— through its news columns, its editorial columns, and its 
advertising pages. Also, it is one of the most effective in- 
struments for regular and continuous publicity, as well as 
for the sporadic form known as the “campaign.” In fact, 
regular and continuous use of the local press by the school 
authorities in advertising important events and expansions, 
in announcing — as news — educational as well as athletic 
occurrences and activities, and in the form of editorials upon 
school subjects, is perhaps the most potent means available 
for educating the public to an understanding and apprecia- 
tion of the schools. A regular school-news column in the 
public press has publicity value far beyond the scope of the 
items appearing in it. In some large cities an unfavorable 
attitude of the local press toward school meetings has been 
met by school authorities by purchasing and publishing a 
paper of their own. 
At least six distinct objectives, the authors set forth, 
can be accomplished through the proper use of the press. 
These are: 
(1) to present the need; (2) to explain it fully and see that it is well 
understood; (3) to interest parents through the contributions of 
their children; (4) to establish confidence in the schools and the 
motives of those who champion their needs; (5) to refute objections 
to proposed increases; (6) to incite to favorable action. 
Paid advertising, as a rule, is restricted to drives or cam- 
paigns. It may appear in the form of display advertise- 
ments in the newspapers, or of slides for the movies, or of 
tags, handbills and posters. Business houses can often be 
persuaded to include an announcement of the campaign and
-P-A-G-E-233
  
SCHOOL PUBLICITY 219 
its purpose in their own paid advertisements. If the cam- 
paign is to culminate in an election, as is usually the case, all 
advertising matter should emphasize, first, the date and 
place of the election, and second, suggestions as to the voter’s 
proper action at that time. 
School exhibits are useful to demonstrate both the needs 
and the accomplishments of the school. They may take the 
form of exhibits of school work or of evidences of progress. 
They may be used to show the part played by the school in 
community life, or to compare the activities of local schools 
with those of schools elsewhere. They may be held in the 
school building, or in down-town shops, or in other public 
places. As a rule effort should be made to take the exhibit 
to the public rather than to bring the public to the exhibit, 
unless a community has already formed the habit of going to 
the schoolhouse en masse upon occasion. The advantage of 
the exhibit in a financial campaign is its concrete expression 
of the real work of the schools. Its disadvantages arise 
from the difficulty of always connecting it clearly with the 
campaign’s objectives. 
Personal visits, letters and post cards, petitions, instruc- 
tions to voters, etc., are such common adjuncts of all politi- 
cal campaigning as to seem to require no further discussion 
here. 
Endorsements, and special reports. The use of endorse- 
ments from prominent people, however, is worthy of a little 
consideration. Such endorsements are valuable when the 
persons making them have nothing personal to gain from the 
campaign, and are still more useful when, as in the case of 
a taxpayer with much property and no children, they in- 
volve an apparent sacrifice on the part of their author or 
authors. Endorsements from organizations are sometimes 
more effective than endorsements from individuals, because 
they tend to commit all of the organization members and
-P-A-G-E-234
220 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
their friends. Each influential endorsement should be given 
as much publicity as possible. 
One effective plan for securing endorsements is to call for 
the appointment of an investigating committee by some 
popular body which is interested in the schools. The report 
of such a committee, if favorable to the purposes of the pro- 
posed campaign, will often afford all that is needed in the 
way of argument in its support. 
It is here that the school survey makes its chief contribu- 
tion to publicity work. A survey, if properly planned, will 
be conducted by disinterested and competent people, and 
its analysis is likely to be regarded by those who know as the 
most reliable statement of conditions that could be obtained. 
Its report has special force as coming from a committee 
of professional experts. It is, therefore, an excellent plan, 
where possible, to let a survey of the school situation precede 
the organization of a publicity campaign. One means of 
publicity which has been used successfully in some instances 
is that of encouraging school visits by the patrons. Where 
this method is used the visitors should witness a program 
which will not only display present conditions in the schools, 
but which will suggest, or even openly urge, the improve- 
ments that are desired. This device is one of the most com- 
mendable of all if it can be used successfully. 
Motives. The word, motive, is used to mean “the one 
appeal or group of appeals which will induce voters through 
their own mental processes to support the proposed increase 
in local school revenues sought by the publicity campaign.” 
Motives may be grouped under four heads: altruistic mo- 
tives, personal motives, motives aroused by confidence in the 
school administration, and motives aroused by the skillful 
presentation of school costs. 
Unquestionably, the public is moved in many if not most 
‘of its actions by a spirit of altruism. This is especially true
-P-A-G-E-235
  SCHOOL PUBLICITY 221. 
of its actions concerning the schools. It is fair to assume 
that most people really desire to do what is best for their 
children, and for their community and State. Honest 
appeals based upon patriotism, or community pride, or the 
love of parent for child, will always be sure to win a quick 
response. In employing altruistic motives, the welfare of 
all should always be emphasized rather than the a 
of any special class. 
The development of woman’s suffrage and the consequent 
direct influence of women upon school policies possibly gives 
additional weight to altruistic appeals. It is thought by 
many that women are more responsive than men to such 
appeals, but everywhere the appeal to these unselfish mo- 
tives is worth making, not only because of the immediate 
response, but also because these motives are worth while in 
themselves. 
Appeals to personal motives — that is, to “our own points 
of view, our own dominant instincts, conceptions, values, 
habits, and needs,” constitute a very effective argument. 
Among these bases of appeal are the public’s interest in in- 
creased local property valuations, and its fears of moral 
dangers, of fire hazards, of epidemics, and the like. The 
altruistic motive is really mixed with the personal motive 
when appeals to parents for better school support are urged 
because of the increased advantages to their children. 
The third class of motives is described as those aroused 
by public confidence in the school’s administration. Special 
mention is made of the reputation enjoyed by the school 
authorities for economy and efficiency, and for truth telling. 
Confidence engenders confidence. It is well for school 
officials to display confidence in the public if they expect to 
receive confidence in return. 
The fourth class of motives, as described by writers in this 
field, really overlaps upon the classifications just made. 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
  222 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
Skillful presentations of facts about the schools make more 
effective the appeals to other motives. The principles gov- 
erning the presentation of these facts will appear in a later 
paragraph. Only one or two suggestions need to be in- 
cluded here. 
It is wise, as a rule, to discuss the needs of the schools, or 
expected benefits, before suggesting costs. In other words, 
awaken a desire for the results of the campaign before the 
question of their cost is raised. The most effective method is 
to suggest to the public in various ways, for a long time be- 
fore the campaign is expected to begin, the need for the pro- 
posed expansion and the benefits to be derived therefrom. 
This preliminary period devoted to educating the public, 
if properly conducted, will awaken a desire for the proposed 
expansion that ean easily be fanned into a flame. Costs will 
then appear to be of secondary importance. 
Great care also should be used in seeking out in advance 
possible objections and misrepresentations on the part of 
opponents to the campaign movement. The public will 
be impressed by immediate and overwhelming arguments, 
but its confidence in the campaign may be lost if this refuta- 
tion is halting or inconclusive. 
Materials. The search for materials for use in a financial 
campaign should begin as a search for facts. The day of the 
demagogue and the emotional revivalist is passing, at least 
so far as public education is concerned. Perhaps the great- 
est contribution of the twentieth century to public education 
has been to put its administration upon a factual basis. 
Facts are now recognized as fundamental in the making of all 
school policies, including those of a financial sort. 
But facts are only basic to the arguments in support of the 
campaign which can be constructed from them. A search for 
arguments will naturally follow upon the search for facts. 
An argument might be defined as a presentation of facts or
-P-A-G-E-237
  SCHOOL PUBLICITY 223 
of inferences drawn from facts, which presentation must be 
adapted to the comprehensions and convictions of the people 
to whom it is addressed and also to the object which the 
argument should sustain. Three things, therefore, will de- 
termine the construction of an argument; (1) the campaign’s 
objective, (2) the people to whom appeal is being made, and 
(3) the underlying facts. 
Arguments may also be grouped in two classes. One 
class of arguments is constructive and is planned to support 
the proposals of the campaign. The second group of argu- 
ments is designed to offset or destroy the arguments of the 
opposition. These latter arguments are therefore negative 
in type. In assembling materials for a campaign it is as im- 
portant to be prepared with rebuttal arguments as it is to be 
equipped with constructive ones. 
When the facts and the arguments have been collected, 
there will next arise the problem of selecting and preparing 
them for use. Nothing is less interesting to the general lay 
mind than a mass of bare facts, while an ill-adapted argu- 
ment may, like a boomerang, return to afflict the man who 
makes it. Facts must be tabulated and graphically inter- 
preted. From the mass of facts, only the most essential 
should be chosen for general publicity, but for each fact thus 
published there should be held in reserve a mass of corrobora- 
tory facts to back it up. Where groups of facts must be 
presented, a table or graph can frequently be used so as to 
consolidate them and make them appear as a single unit. 
Sometimes, however, a verbal summary of the facts will be 
preferable to either tables or graphs. 
Who shall collect and prepare these facts and arguments? 
The answer to this question will depend upon the campaign 
personnel. If a group of educational experts has been em- 
ployed this work would seem to be their major duty; other- 
wise the burden will probably fall upon the superintendent
-P-A-G-E-238
  224 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
and his teachers. Frequent use has been made of high school 
classes where the materials sought for were not too intricate 
or hard to find. It should go without saying that when this 
process has been completed, the facts and arguments should 
be got before the public by means of the instruments de- 
scribed above. 
Many of the materials required in most campaigns can be 
assembled from standard sources, and need not be collected 
independently for each campaign. The school surveys, in 
particular, are prolific sources of information on school ex- 
penditures. In one of the early chapters dealing with 
“Comparative School Costs,” much data and many refer- 
ences have been given which will be helpful here. In some 
cases the most valuable materials will be those which prove 
the value of education to the people who are being asked to 
pay. Such materials, both facts and arguments, will be 
found distributed through the educational literature. 
Principles. Perhaps the most important principle to ob- 
serve in planning a campaign is to keep in mind that the 
so-called “general public” is in reality a mass of individual 
men and women, each of whom has his own individual ideas 
and inclinations. Ideally, every appeal to the public mind 
should be a personal appeal to each individual member of 
the social group. Practically, however, such an individual 
appeal is usually out of the question. Time and money are 
too limited to permit it to be used extensively. Moreover, 
there are in every community certain more or less defined 
or homogeneous groups. Members of the same church, or 
of the same secret order, or political party, or economic or- 
ganization, or labor union, or industry or profession, hold 
certain attitudes in common. Practical advantage can be 
taken of this fact by planning the campaign to reach each of 
1See, for example, a monograph by A. Caswell Ellis entitled The Money 
Value of an Education, U.S. Bureau of Education, Bulletin no, 22 (1917).  
-P-A-G-E-239
  SCHOOL PUBLICITY 225 
these groups of people. Alexander and Theisen express this 
principle as follows: 
The public is not to be thought of as made up of so many indi- 
viduals. It is rather to be regarded as consisting of foci or rallying 
points around which individuals, having interests and desires in 
common, center. The members of any one of these groups are, to 
a large extent, to use Prof. Giddings’ designation, “like-minded,” 
so far as their motive for supporting or opposing the campaign 
issue goes. The problem for the campaign manager and his staff 
is to locate these groups, to discover the basis for their opposition 
or support, and to work accordingly. ...If the members of the 
different groups cannot be reached directly, their leaders must. . . . 
This principle should in general be kept in mind: Try to win as 
many active supporters in the group as possible. 
These same writers name the following significant groups: 
(1) illiterates; (2) non-English; (3) women; (4) heavy tax- 
payers; (5) retired farmers; (6) families without children of 
school age; (7) workers who can’t leave work to attend 
meetings; (8) young people; (9) school children. 
Timing the campaign. A second important principle has 
to do with the timing of the campaign. In large cities 
special drives for public funds are likely to be numerous, and 
unless they are distributed over the year are almost certain 
to conflict. It is important, therefore, in planning a school 
campaign to avoid the competition of other drives. It is 
desirable also, when possible, to be first rather than last in 
the field. Other principles are as follows: 
(1) Follow the accepted methods of good argumentation. 
(2) Assume that the public is right-minded and interested 
in its schools, and awaits only the facts and arguments in 
order to respond to any fair request. 
(3) Don’t point with shame to deficiencies in the local 
situation; rather compliment the people upon what they 
have done and are trying todo. Stimulate their local pride, 
both school and civic. An attempt to shame the public will
-P-A-G-E-240
  226 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
only put it on the defensive; but people who are led to regard 
themselves as earnest supporters of education will usually 
respond in a way that is consistent with such an idea. 
(4) Keep the campaign upon a dignified plane; avoid the 
arts of the demagogue; stick to the facts or to the arguments 
that can be factually supported. 
(5) Plan carefully in advance; define your objective 
clearly; collect your materials systematically; analyze your 
public effectively. 
(6) Direct your attack on strategic centers. Try to secure 
newspaper support. Get endorsements from influential 
leaders. Get the backing of influential groups. The mem- 
bers of these groups are likely to follow the fashion of their 
group and the advice of their leaders. 
(7) Show a reasonable appreciation of other community 
needs. Especially try to avoid putting the schools into 
apparent competition with other civic institutions. An 
honest recognition of this principle would mean that one 
should have considered the relative school need in connection 
with other civic needs before even launching the campaign. 
Much of the hostility of civic officers to school superintend- 
ents and boards of education could have been avoided if 
the latter had remembered that streets and parks and other 
municipal departments must be sustained in the main from 
the same purse that sustains the schools. 
(8) Show respect and feel respect for the opposition. In 
it will be numbered not only selfish interests seeking to keep 
down taxes, but also well-disposed people whose only fault is 
ignorance. Your problem is to win these people to your 
cause. Do not alienate them at the start by a show of dis- 
respect or derision. 
(9) Watch carefully the arguments of the opposition. 
Try to foresee as many of them as youcan. Prepare counter 
arguments in advance. In preparing your arguments, re-
-P-A-G-E-241
  
SCHOOL PUBLICITY 227 
spect the intelligence of your opponents. Choose arguments 
that will convince the more intellectual; formulate and state 
them so that they can be understood by the less intelligent. 
In other words, avoid arguments that are hollow and state- 
ments that are involved. It is better to offer no rebuttal at 
all than one which may react to your disadvantage. 
(10) The after effects of the campaign should be kept con- 
stantly in mind. Promises should never be made which are 
impossible of fulfillment. Untruthful statements should be 
avoided like the plague. The effect of the campaign should 
be to pave the way to greater confidence and appreciation. 
It should make the next campaign easier and not more diffi- 
cult. Unfortunately, school campaigns have sometimes been 
conducted in such a way that while they were successful in 
gaining their avowed ends, the last conditions were really 
worse than the first. The methods used or the promises 
made were such that in the end the public was turned 
against their authors. It would have been better for the 
schools in these communities if such campaigns had never 
been attempted. 
Regular or continuous publicity. Our discussion to this 
point has concerned itself with occasional publicity — that 
is with the drive or campaign which is carried through for 
the achievement of some specific purpose. These campaigns, 
because they have been directed toward the satisfying of 
some unusual need, have utilized materials and methods 
which have generally proved effective. Practically, oc- 
casional publicity efforts have been more efficient in the 
past than has regular publicity. From the standpoint of the 
theory, however, these campaigns or drives are only inci- 
dental to a larger and more continuous policy. The vital 
purpose of the school is to achieve a regular publicity pro- 
gram built upon the principles and utilizing the methods of 
these campaigns.
-P-A-G-E-242
  228 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
The standard form of regular publicity up to this time has 
been the school report, prepared annually for circulation by 
the school board and superintendent. This type of report 
originated in the New England States more than a century 
ago, and is a natural descendant of the oral report made by 
the town school committee at the annual town meeting.! 
It was carried westward by emigrants from these States and 
finally has spread more or less completely over the country. 
The nature of these reports in general is consistent with 
this type of origin. The oral reports from which they sprang 
were such reports of financial income and expenditures as 
might be expected of a treasurer reporting to a meeting. 
School costs were low in these early days, and their details 
easily comprehended. But when this same procedure was 
carried over to printed reports, and when school finance had 
grown to the proportions which it now assumes in our 
modern cities, these tabulated summaries of income and 
outgo ceased to be as useful as they once were. Their in- 
adequacy is slowly being recognized to-day. In some 
cities tabulated summaries have given place to simplified 
statements of selected facts, intelligently arranged and 
attractively presented. This commendable change, how- 
ever, is at present only sporadic among our cities. Most 
school reports are still of the conventional type. Neale 
summarizes his study of these reports ? in the United States 
in the following criticisms: 
1. The reports are, in general, issued in such small numbers as to 
make it impossible for them to reach more than from two to thirty 
per cent of the families in American cities.

2. In typical school reports no special attempt is made to render 
them readable and attractive. Only about one third of city school 
reports contain graphs, cartoons, maps, or charts and only thirty- 
four per cent contain pictures illustrative of school work or school 
activities. 
8. Annual reports are too long to be read by the majority of 
citizens. There is no question in the minds of advertising men but 
the vast majority of men and women simply will not take the time 
to read a 75 or 80 or 100 page document on all phases of school 
work and probably none of the superintendents who write annual 
reports actually believes that any appreciable number of the people 
of his community pay any special attention to the statistical tables 
which he inserts, unless some definite problem comes up on which 
the tables give information. 
4. In over ninety per cent of the school reports examined, no 
definite problems were set up for solution. The reports were 
written in accordance with the law of the State, in compliance with 
the rules and regulations of the board of education, in accordance 
with custom, to review the past year’s work, show conditions in the 
schools, to cause teachers to become more interested in school work, 
etc. It is the exceptional school report which sets up definite clear- 
cut issues or problems and then proceeds to present material which 
bears on the solution of the problem stated. 
5. There is a mass of material in most annual reports which 
seems to be put in either as a filler, as a permanent record or because 
of its interest to a very limited group of persons. In this class of 
material would fall commencement programs and class rolls, lists of 
janitors, custodians and engineers, school laws and administrative 
rules of the Board of Education, floor plans and front elevations of 
school buildings, reports of supervisors addressed to the superin- 
tendent of schools, school calendars, long lists of textbooks, alumni 
directories, lists of honors, awards and perfect attendance, minutes 
of board meetings, student directories and itemized expenditures. 
6. The mechanical nature of the make-up of many of the reports 
is not such as to attract readers. ‘Twenty-six of the one hundred 
and three reports examined, contained an index but no table of 
contents. Twenty-one contained the table of contents but no 
index, eight had both the index and a table of contents, while forty- 
eight contained neither table of contents nor index. Slightly less 
than fifteen per cent of the reports were written in eight point type 
which is‘extremely difficult to read and certainly not calculated to
-P-A-G-E-244
  230 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
invite attention to the content, no matter how simple the language 
or interesting the subject. 
The corrective for this situation is to apply the principles 
and methods of the school campaign regularly throughout 
the year. This application of principles being more ex- 
tensive, would necessarily be less intensive than in the typi- 
cal campaign. Frequently, also, it would be directed toward 
informing the public rather than toward persuading the 
public to adopt some specific measure. It would present 
this information to the public in a diluted form, and in ways 
which would make it attractive and comprehensible. 
Neale concludes his study with these recommendations: 
First, he says, “‘the manner of presenting school facts must 
be based on a clear conception of the audience to be reached.” 
This is another statement of the point already made that the 
general public should be analyzed into its component groups. 
Second, he quotes Professor Gates’ conclusion that the lan- 
guage ability of average adults is about that of pupils in the 
sixth and seventh grades, and argues therefrom that the 
reading material in school reports should be simplified ac- 
cordingly. Third, he urges that the principles of psychology 
which apply to advertising in general should guide in the 
formation of a policy of reporting school facts to the public. 
Such a report should be directed toward specific purposes. 
Its style should be understandable by its readers. It should 
be timely, not concerned with matters out of date. It should 
recognize the fact that “people strive to further those move- 
ments and causes for which they have a feeling of value.” 
As to ways and means, Neale recommends: (1) an annual 
report; (2) a timely financial report; (3) monographs on live 
issues; (4) a school bulletin or newspaper; (5) a definite pro- 
gram of newspaper couperation; and (6) a carefully selected 
personnel trained for the specific work of school reporting. 
Chapter summary. ‘The conclusion of the discussion of

our first major problem has now been reached. Local finan- 
cial management, which has been seen to involve budget- 
making, cost comparisons, adequate accounting, and an 
intelligent control of school indebtedness, is here seen. to 
culminate in a process of publicity on all matters likely to 
effect an increase of funds. The first four of these topics 
have had to do with control; the fifth and last one has to do 
with revenue increases. 
This chapter has been drawn in the main from a book by 
Alexander and Theisen, and from a book by M. G. Neale. 
Both its organization and its materials have been largely 
extracted from these sources. Justification for this rather 
extensive borrowing lies in the fact that there are few, if any, 
other sources in this field which are comparable to these. 
After a brief discussion of the need for financial publicity, 
emphasis has been given in this chapter to a comparison. of 
its outstanding types. Regular school publicity has been 
typified by the annual school report; sporadic publicity by 
the campaign or drive. The chapter has led to a recom- 
mendation for combining the regularity of the first type with 
the intelligent use of the methods of modern advertising 
which have appeared in connection with the second. A 
somewhat detailed discussion of campaign organization and 
administration has also been included, involving personnel, 
means or instruments, motives, materials, and principles. 
TOPICS FOR INVESTIGATION AND DISCUSSION 
1. Assume a bond issue for the construction of a new school building in 
your town or city. Describe how you would determine the proper 
amount of the issue, how you would secure the endorsement of the 
school board, and how you would handle the issuing of the bonds in 
accordance with the laws of your State. Also, plan a publicity 
campaign for securing a public endorsement of the bond issue. 
2. Has any publicity campaign for school support been conducted in 
your town or State? If so, investigate the details of the adminis-

tration of your campaign and criticize them in the light of this chap- 
ter. 
. Is it proper to regard school publicity as a parallel of commercial 
publicity? If not, just where does the parallelism break down? 
. Make a collection of annual school reports issued by superintendents 
and school boards of cities in your State. Analyze these reports 
according to the plan used by Neale. In what ways could these reports 
be made more effective instruments of financial publicity? 
. Which features of the campaign or drive are most applicable to the 
regular publicity of the schools? Which are least applicable? 
. What measures for increasing the local support of public schools can 
you suggest, other than those suggested in this chapter?

  CHAPTER IX 
EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITIES 
Purpose of this chapter. Chapters III to VIII, inclusive, 
have been occupied with the discussion of the first of the 
three large problems raised for consideration in this book. 
This was the problem of securing better financial manage- 
ment in each local school and school system. The problem 
has been styled the “local” problem because in its considera- 
tion it was unnecessary, except in the chapter devoted to 
comparative cost studies, to step outside the confines of the 
local school district. Even in that one exceptional chapter, 
the discussion was pointed toward the local use of the data 
gathered in the study of comparative school costs. Up to 
this point, then, we have been attending to matters of very 
direct practical importance to every local superintendent of 
schools. 
This chapter and the two following will be taken up with 
the consideration of the second major problem of the book. 
This second problem centers around the activities of the 
various units of school support. The units generally re- 
cognized are the common and independent school districts, 
the town, township, or county, the State and, to a minor 
degree at the present time, the Nation. From another view- 
point this second problem may be described as that of se- 
curing more nearly equalized financial support. Asa matter 
of fact, the discussion here presented ‘is largely from this 
latter viewpoint. The present chapter will seek to demon- 
strate the fact that different local schools are very unequally 
supported, with the result that different communities offer to 
their children very unequal educational advantages. In the 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
  238 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
light of these inequalities our boasted American school 
system appears to be very undemocratic. The following 
chapters will discuss the ways and means available for reduc- 
ing these educational inequalities. 
Kinds of educational inequalities. The inequalities exist- 
ing in the field of public education appear in a variety of 
forms. For example, one will find rather marked inequali- 
ties in the costs of different educational necessities as he goes 
from State to State. The most conspicuous of these cost 
differences is in the matter of wages and salaries, which are 
relatively high in the Pacific Coast States and relatively low 
in the South. Salary inequalities, however, may perhaps 
more properly be regarded as a consequence of other inequal- 
ities to be mentioned below. ‘The varying costs of fuel 
from State to State present another example of cost inequal- 
ities. Here the variation arises not only out of the difference 
in price, but also out of the differences in quantity con- 
sumed. The Northern States and the Southern States 
illustrate the latter sort of variability. 
Another type of educational inequalities may be termed 
the inequalities of need. Need is generally reckoned in 
terms of number of children who must be educated. Some 
communities have many children, and others have few 
children, in proportion to their wealth and population. 
Even States will be found to differ considerably in this re- 
spect. No adequate study of educational inequalities can 
ignore this factor of need. 
Much mention is found in recent educational literature 
about the unequal ability of communities and even of States 
to support their schools. Ability is usually measured in 
terms of wealth per child. Such a measure, it will be ob- 
served, includes the element of need as well as that of ability. 
The quantity of wealth in a community is the measure of its 
total ability, but when reckoned in terms of wealth per in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
  EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITIES 239 
dividual child we have ability stated with reference to need. 
When such a measure is used in the study of relative ability, 
therefore, there is no necessity for a separate consideration 
of need. 
A fourth type of educational inequality, also frequently 
mentioned to-day, is inequality of effort. Given the same 
wealth and the same number of children, some communities 
will be found to be much more generous with their schools 
than will others. The extent of these differences in effort, 
as of other types of inequalities, will appear in later sections 
of this chapter. 
Inequalities in assistance received constitute a fifth class or 
type. «Reference is here made to the financial aid extended 
by the State or county, and the amount of such aid that is 
received by each local unit in proportion to its need. Under 
the plan of apportionment now employed by most of the 
States, this aid is often very unequally distributed among the 
local districts. 
All of the foregoing types of inequalities culminate in the 
sixth and last type; that is, inequalities in results. The 
educational advantages offered by different communities to 
their children are very unequal, both in quality and in 
amount. The same is true of the offerings of different 
States. It thus happens that some children, by the mere 
accident of having been born into a progressive community 
or State, inherit extensive educational opportunities. Other 
children, born in unprogressive places, by the misfortune of 
this place of birth inherit very inferior advantages. More- 
over, the children who have been reared in an unprogressive 
community, without educational advantages, may later 
move into a more progressive community. Thus the quality 
of the citizenry of communities which endeavor to maintain 
good schools may be lowered by the influx of poorly educated 
people from less progressive places. It is for these reasons
-P-A-G-E-254
  240 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
that many modern writers characterize American education 
s “undemocratic.” 
Is American education democratic? In support of the 
statement just made, that the American public school 
system is charged with failing to provide the educational 
facilities which should be expected in a society which seeks 
to be democratic in its principles, the following quotations 
are inserted. 
It may be startling, but it is nevertheless true, that at the present 
moment education in the United States is neither universal nor 
democratic nor free. ... That it is not democratic is shown by the 
inequalities in educational opportunity to be found not only in 
every State in the Union, but existing within the counties of the 
same State.? 
The acid test of democracy is equality of opportunity. The 
foundation and safeguard of democracy is equality of educational 
opportunity.” 
Democracy, then, is opportunity. It is opportunity for indi- 
vidual expression, with a view to unfoldment and advancement. It 
is opportunity which is at once equable and free. ... Democracy in 
education, like democracy everywhere, consists in freedom and 
equity of opportunity. In this case it is educational opportunity 
which must be equable and free.... Democracy in education 
involves both equality and variety of educational provisions; 
equality as between communities of similar form and type, and 
variety in the offerings of each community in order to serve the 
needs of individual children.* 
If these statements are correct regarding the importance 
and nature of democracy in education, then the conditions 
that are revealed in the sections below seem fully to justify 
the charge made against the American public school system.

  EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITIES 241 
specific inequalities, it will be well to pause long enough to 
list the recognized units of school support and control. The 
various inequalities to be discussed are in fact differences 
existing between individual units of the same kind or 
class. 
The earliest supporting units to develop, in point of time, 
were the local school districts and, in New England, the 
towns. These units carried almost all of the burden down to 
about 1825. From that time until about 1890, the State 
became an increasingly important factor in the maintenance 
of public education. Since the Civil War period an in- 
termediate unit, between the State and the local district, 
has appeared in the form of the township in a few middle- 
western States and of the county elsewhere. The county 
unit of support has made remarkable progress since 1900. 
During the past few years, also, the Nation has come into 
the fore-front of the public consciousness as a possible unit 
of support for public schools. 
In this chapter will be illustrated the differences in ability, 
effort, etc., found in common and independent school dis- 
tricts, in towns, townships, and counties, and in States. 
The next chapter will consider the possibility of relating the 
various members of this hierarchy of supporting units in 
such a way as greatly to reduce, if not completely to remove, 
these educational inequalities. 
Inequalities in financial ability. The discussion will now 
center upon the evidence showing the existence and extent of 
various kinds of educational inequalities. In this discus- 
sion, however, we may properly pass over two of the six 
types that have been mentioned. Inequalities in costs are 
difficult to determine with exactness, because prices fluc- 
tuate, and because there are few available data. Inequalities 
in need will require little or no separate discussion, for the 
reason that other inequalities, as in ability and effort, are
-P-A-G-E-256

242 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
commonly expressed in terms of wealth or expenditure per | 
child, and hence include the factor of need as contained in 
the number of children. Consideration will be given, there- 
fore, only to inequalities in ability, in effort, in aid received, 
and in results. First, let us observe the evidences of in- 
equalities in financial ability to maintain schools. 
Bases of comparison. Ability to pay for schools is 
measured in terms of wealth. Other things being equal, the 
greater the wealth that is located within a district, township, 
county, or State, the greater is the ability of that unit to 
support good schools. But as a rule other things are also 
found to be unequal, especially the number of children to be 
educated. 
If two districts each have a valuation of $20,000, and one of 
these districts has to educate 50 children and the other 150 children, 
it is easy to see that it will be very unfair to consider them equally 
able to provide schools of the same standard. One of these districts 
ought to provide at least two teachers, the other, at least six, allow- 
ing 25 pupils per teacher. For this reason it is customary to take its 
wealth per child as the measure of the ability of a State, a county, 
or a school district to provide schools. 
One basis of comparison, then, is the wealth per child in 
each of the supporting units whose ability is being studied. 
But this basis is not altogether simple. One must know, for 
instance, whether it is real or assessed wealth that is being 
considered. Assessed wealth is the total value of the pro- 
perty rendered for taxes, valued at the rate of rendition 
Real wealth, however, would include assessed wealth plu 
additional value of property rendered over the rate of rendi 
tion, plus other property overlooked by the assessor. Owing 
to the many difficulties in the way of reaching an accurate 
statement of real wealth, assessed wealth is usually taken in 
studies of ability to maintain schools. Also, in defining the 
basis “wealth per child,” it is necessary to know just what 
 
-P-A-G-E-257
ee ee EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITIES ’ 243 
“ kind of child is meant. It may mean “child in average 
daily attendance,” or “child enrolled,” or “census child.” 
Each of these meanings has its advantages, and all are used 
in studies of comparative ability. This fact makes difficult, 
occasionally, the comparison of the data presented in differ- 
ent studies. If one is interested in a district’s ability to bear 
its actual burden, then “child in average daily attendance” 
is doubtless the best unit. If one’s interest lies in what the 
burden ought to be, then “census child” is better. The unit 
“child enrolled” has the advantage of being a fair measure 
of both the actual and the potential burden. In comparing 
States in which scholastic ages differ, it is common to select 
an arbitrary range of ages in the enumeration of the children, 
say from six to twenty years. 
Cubberley, whose work in the field of State support of ed- 
ucation is of a very high order, prefers to compare the tax- 
rates necessary in the different units of support to raise a 
stipulated sum for every teacher actually employed. He 
writes: 
The number of teachers employed is the best basis of comparison, 
when dealing with small towns, as the chief cost of maintaining 
schools is the amount paid for the salary of the teacher.? 
This basis has been applied in comparisons of district 
ability in the recent New York Rural School Survey. In 
this survey ? the per-teacher basis is defended, as follows: 
This method has two advantages: (1) The salaries of teachers 
amount to from sixty to seventy per cent of the total expense in 
cities and from seventy to eighty-five per cent in rural districts. (2) 
There is a close relationship between the number of teachers in a 
particular school and the number of units or classes that compose it. 
It is, therefore, the best measure for the size of a school system.

In a study of school support in Illinois, Reeves ! presents 
a somewhat extended criticism of several different bases of 
comparison. ‘The total ability of districts to maintain 
schools is measured in this study in terms of the “full as- 
sessed valuation” of the property of each district, although 
the deficiencies of this measure are recognized and pointed 
out. The problem is then raised whether, in order to con- 
vert this statement of total ability into terms which will 
include the factor of need, this full assessed valuation of each 
district should be divided by the number of children en- 
rolled, or by the number in average daily attendance, or by 
the number listed on the school census, or by the number of 
teachers actually employed. ‘‘ Valuation per pupil enrolled” 
is eliminated as a practicable unit of comparison because it 
“makes no allowance for the factor of the tuition pupil.” 
Tuition pupils were found to be sufficiently numerous, and 
also sufficiently irregularly distributed among the different 
districts in Illinois, to make them a vital factor in the 
problem. The same complication makes impractical the 
use of “valuation per pupil in average daily attendance.” 
Because the number of teachers employed is, or should be, 
dependent upon the number of children enrolled and attend- 
ing, the objection advanced to the units of comparison just 
mentioned also affects adversely the “valuation per teacher 
employed.” Reeves concludes that “valuation per child of 
school age”’ is the most practicable basis for comparing the 
relative ability of Illinois school districts to support their 
schools. 
To the arguments advanced by Reeves one might add the 
rather obvious suggestion that, if the school census is at all 
accurate, it is probably the best single index of what the 
school burden of a district ought to be. If every district in

  EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITIES 245 
a State were to discharge its full educational duty to its 
children, it is probable that every district would serve about 
the same proportion of its census children. As a basis for 
distributing financial aid from central to local supporting 
units the use of the census enumeration is very unfair and 
inadequate, as will be made clear in Chapter XI, but as a 
basis for measuring the relative ability of districts or other 
supporting units to provide for schools it, together with the 
valuation of that unit, is one of the best bases of comparison 
available. The chief limitation upon it is the fact that school 
costs are not proportional to the number of children for 
whom facilities must be provided. They are more nearly 
proportional to the number of teachers. The “valuation 
per teacher employed” unit should therefore be used to- 
gether with the “valuation per census child” unit, wherever 
possible. 
Inequalities in, district ability. The smallest and most 
numerous, as well as most nearly universal unit of school 
support is the local school district. Many studies have 
recently appeared to demonstrate the financial inequalities 
existing in these local units. The state school surveys are 
especially prolific in this type of investigation. One of the 
best and most recent of these studies is found in the New 
York Survey, already quoted. A summary of the facts 
found in this survey is presented in Table XVI. This table 
includes data from 1011 common school districts, 79 free 
school districts, and 104 city and village districts. The 
property valuations of all of these different districts have 
been “‘equalized”’; that is, put into terms of a common per- 
centage of their actual or real value. 
Inspection of this table shows that there were two common 
school districts with valuations under $10,000, and five with 
valuations of over $900,000 per teacher employed. The 
last five districts had more than 90 times as much wealth per

school districts had valuations per teacher under $65,117, and 
another quarter had valuations over $182,031. The highest 
valued quarter, of over 250 districts, thus had nearly three 
times as much wealth per teacher as did the lowest valued

group. One union free school district had under $40,000 
and two had over $350,000 per teacher; a proportion of 
nearly nine to one in favor of the wealthier districts. Of the 
city and village districts one had a valuation of less than 
$100,000 per teacher employed, and another of more than 
$900,000. Here the proportion is greater than nine to one. 
If this group of nearly 1200 of the local school districts of 
New York State is representative of them all, it seems clear 
that the districts in that State vary greatly in their ability 
to support good schools. 
Similar financial inequalities are found in every study in 
every State where the problem of relative district ability 
has beeninvestigated. Thus Davis found in Karnes County, 
Texas, fourteen common school districts with less than 
$2000, and five with nearly $4000, per census child. In Wil- 
liamson County, Texas, the same investigator found four 
districts with less than $1000, and one with more than $6000 
per census child. In wealth per child enrolled in school, the 
Karnes County districts ranged from $2006 in one district 
to $10,067 in another. 
In Conejos County, Colorado, the wealth per child was 
found to range from $617 in one school district to $26,545 in 
another. In Otero County, Colorado, the range in district 
wealth per child was from $3374 to $21,544.2 In Lincoln 
County, Wyoming, the range in wealth of districts per cen- 
sus child was from $964 to $15,419. The wealth per teacher 
in these same Wyoming districts ranged from $36,833 in the 
poorest to $400,693 in the wealthiest district. In 166 local 
school districts in Delaware the wealth per teacher ranged 
from under $40,000 to over $200,000.

city and village districts in New York State, a similar varia- 
tion in ability, but with not quite so wide a range. It also 
shows that city and village districts average nearly twice as 
much wealth per teacher as do the common school districts, 
although some common districts are wealthier than some 
city districts. Other surveys have uncovered almost identi- 
cal facts. Thus in 63 cities and towns in Michigan, there 
was found a range in wealth per census child of from $1241 
to $7378. The range in 16 Wyoming cities was from $1081 
to $7378. Twenty Virginia cities varied in wealth per child 
enrolled from $1671 to $4975. Among 355 cities and towns 
in Massachusetts, one was found with less than $1000 for 
each child in average daily attendance, while another was 
found with more than $43,000 for each such pupil. “In 
general,”’ says Cubberley,? “the larger the town the larger 
its per capita wealth for each pupil in average membership 
in the schools.” 
Unequal abilities of other units. Districts are not the only 
units of school support which vary in financial ability. 
Such wealth inequalities exist in every other type of support- 
ing unit. Thus Munson found in the townships of three 
Michigan counties a range of valuations from $1600 to 
$6000 per child, in those of two other counties from $2600 to 
$14,000, and in those of still another county from $600 to 
$5000. The per-pupil wealth of townships seems, there- 
fore, to vary almost as greatly as the per-pupil wealth of 
districts. : 
The varying ability of counties to support schools is 
proved by statistics from a number of States. Swift reports 
for Colorado one county with a valuation of $1822 and an- 
other with $22,674 per school child. Nine counties in Col- 
orado have a valuation per child of under $5000, and seven

counties in that State have a corresponding valuation of 
over $10,000. Among Massachusetts counties Cubberley 
found a range in values per school child of from $3294 to 
$11,584. Munson found ten Michigan counties with a 
valuation per child of under $2000, and one with a valuation 
over $8000. He writes: “The most favored county has 
back of each child about six times the valuation of the low- 
est county.” Nine Minnesota counties showed a range in 
wealth per child of from $2338 to $14,906. Fifteen Pennsyl- 
vania counties ranged in valuation per scholastic from 
under $1000 to over $5000. Davis reports that “many of 
the West Texas counties have more than $10,000 of wealth 
per school child. Most of the East Texas counties have 
less than $2000 per school child.” Five Wisconsin counties 
had less than $3000 per scholastic, while one had more than 
$9000. Crook County, Wyoming, showed a valuation per 
child of $2783, while Natrona County showed a correspond- 
ing valuation of $11,467. In California, in 1919, the range 
in county valuations per child enrolled was from $3261 to 
$20,666. Maryland, in 1914, ranged from $710 per census 
child in St. Marys County to $3840 in Baltimore County. 
In Kentucky, “Bourbon County in 1920 had back of each 
child of school age $7615 of taxable property; Jefferson, 
$4861; Carter, $1066; and Magoffin, $546.” In Virginia 
(1918) one group of counties showed an assessed wealth per 
child enrolled of $231, $430, and $639; while another group 
showed corresponding valuations of $1288, $3230, and $4182. 
Like all the subordinate units, States, when compared 
one with another, show wide variations in their financial 
values as related to the probable cost of proper schools. In 
1912, sixteen States had less than $200,000 in wealth back of 
each teacher employed, while one had more than $600,000; 
and seven had less than $3000 valuation for every person 
between six and twenty years of age, while one had more
-P-A-G-E-265
EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITIES 251 
than $27,000 for each such person. The following quoted 
statement! shows in detail the condition in contrasting 
States: 
The wealth per capita varies from $669.36 in Mississippi to 
$4135 in Nevada. 
The taxable wealth behind each person of school age varies from 
$2026.31 in Mississippi to $27,360.70 in Nevada, with an average of 
$6296.55 for the entire country. California can raise $30 for the 
education of each person of school age by a millage one-seventh as 
large as is necessary in Mississippi to raise the same amount. The 
tax rate would have to be twice as great in Missouri as in Iowa to 
raise a given sum for each person of school age. Virginia’s rate 
would have to be three times as large as that of the District of 
Columbia. 
Maine has .5896 per cent of the wealth of the country, .7572 
per cent of the population, and .7034 per cent of the children of 
school age. 
California has 4.5918 per cent of the wealth of the country, 
2.8805 per cent of the population, and 2.002 per cent of the chil- 
dren of school age. 
Towa has 4.2563 per cent of the wealth of the country, 2.1764 
per cent of the population, and 2.4332 per cent of the children of 
school age. 
Mississippi has .7477 per cent of the wealth of the country, 
1.9130 per cent of the population, and 2.3235 per cent of the chil- 
dren of school age. 
Comparative inequalities in ability. An important ques- 
tion, preliminary to the discussion of the proper distribution 
of the burden of school support in the next chapter, has to do 
with the relative size of the inequalities in ability shown by 
school districts, by townships, by counties, and by States. 
Logically, the districts would be expected to show the widest 
range of differences in financial ability, and the States the 
narrowest range. Counties and townships would be ex- 
pected to rank in between. City districts are known to 
1 Keith, J. A. H., and Bagley, W. C.: The Nation and the Schools, 1920. pp.

-P-A-G-E-266
  252 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
vary less widely than do common school districts. No 
doubt, if one were to determine the extreme range of differ- 
ence in wealth per child between the richest and poorest 
school district in the United States, the richest and poorest 
township, and county, and State, he would find this logical 
expectancy fulfilled. 
When concrete statistics such as have been presented are 
considered, it is difficult to find any evident rule in the 
matter. Some counties seem to vary as widely in wealth per 
child as do local districts. Some districts are more nearly 
equal in ability than some States. On the whole, however, 
the statistics roughly confirm the logical expectation. Dis- 
tricts vary more widely than townships or counties, and 
these more widely than States. The larger the unit, the 
less is the range of variation; the smaller the unit, the 
greater is the range. 
Inequalities in effort. Passing to the next of the types of 
educational inequalities, we find that financial effort, like 
ability, has been measured by different students in different 
terms. Swift and Del Plaine write: 
If we wish to compare communities as to their effort to provide 
schools we may take expenditure per child. Other measures of 
effort are the rate of school tax and the amount of money expended 
for schools on each $1000 of estimated wealth. 
Expenditure per child would seem to be an acceptable 
measure only if analyzed into the amounts raised per child 
from each supporting unit. Thus, to say that one district 
spent $30 and another $40 per pupil means little in this con- 
nection, unless it is shown that the districts raised the money 
as well as spent it. It is the raising rather than the spending 
of money that constitutes effort. Taken in toto, without 
reference to their sources, comparative district expenditures 
are better measures of educational inequalities than of in- 
equalities of effort. Of the measures here mentioned, the
-P-A-G-E-267
  EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITIES 253 
most satisfactory would seem to be the school tax rate, 
providing that the assessment rates of the supporting units 
under comparison are the same, and that there is no im- 
portant local source of supply other than taxation. 
In seeking out the evidences for this type of inequalities, 
one naturally turns to the general sources which have been 
cited above — that is, the school surveys. Considerable 
data on relative tax rates are obtainable from these sources, 
but as a rule these rates have not been equalized. ‘The best 
available data of this sort appear in the New York Rural 
School Survey, and are presented here in Table XVII. This 
table summarizes the equalized tax rates (based on equal- 
ized assessments) in over 1200 school districts in the Empire 
State. The tax rates levied in the common school districts 
range from under one mill in ten districts to over thirty-four 
mills in one. Roughly estimated, one fourth of these dis- 
tricts levied rates under 3.5 mills, and another fourth levied 
rates over eight mills. The range in the union free school 
districts was from under four to more than twenty mills; in 
the city and village districts from three to fifteen mills. 
City and village districts differ least in effort as represented 
by the annual school tax rate, but even in their case the best 
effort is five times as great as the poorest. In the common 
school districts, where the range of inequalities is greatest, 
the proportion is thirty-four to one. 
Such a statement of comparative effort fails to take any 
account of the element of need. It measures total effort in 
terms of wealth, but it does not measure it in terms of chil- 
dren. Herein lies the advantage of the “expenditure per 
child” as a unit of measurement, provided that this phrase 
is understood to be synonymous with the “amount raised 
per child” in each of the supporting units which are being 
compared. Unfortunately, it is seldom clear from the sur- 
veys in which this basis of comparison appears that this is its

meaning. On the contrary, it is frequently evident that ex- 
penditures from all sources are lumped together. In these 
cases we have really a comparison of educational opportu- 
nities, rather than of efforts to provide schools. Effort 
is considered only in terms of all of the supporting units 
involved. 
Another interesting feature of the “effort” problem is 
revealed in Table XVII. Here are given, at the bottom, 
the median equalized tax rates for each of the three types of 
school districts. It appears that the common school dis- 
tricts make the least effort as a whole, although there are 
several which greatly exceed the mark set by all but one of 
the other districts. The union free school districts put forth 
the greatest effort, as measured by relative median tax rates. 
The principle here exhibited obtains in general throughout 
the surveys. The common school districts make the least 
effort, on the average, of any of the supporting units, al- 
though their range of difference in effort is the greatest. 
Relations of foregoing inequalities. Swift, in the Okla- 
homa School Survey,! lays down the principle that “as

wealth decreases school taxes increase.” In support of this 
declaration he presents a diagram which is here summa- 
rized in Table XVIII. 
It is clear from this table that, taken on a large scale, 
school district tax rates increase in rough proportion to the 
decrease in property valuation. This is, of course, what 
would logically be expected. If all school support came from 
the local districts (as more than three quarters of it does in 
Oklahoma), if the school burden of each district was the 
same as that of every other, and if perfect equality of edu- 
cational opportunity was the only consideration, then dis- 
trict school tax rates would have to vary inversely with the 
district valuations. ‘The outcome would be perfect educa- 
tional equality founded upon a radical, almost desperate, 
inequality of effort. 
The fact is, of course, that there is no such perfect inverse 
correlation between effort and ability. Also, there is out- 
side financial interference, which likewise reveals serious 
inequalities as shown in the next section of this chapter. 
There are also inequalities in the number of children to be 
educated; and the total assemblage of these various inequal- 
ities results in a great variety of educational opportunities, 
also to be exemplified later on in this chapter. It is useful, 
though, to note here that financial effort tends to vary in 
inverse ratio to financial ability, so that the heavier burdens 
tend to fall upon the communities least able to bear them. 
This principle holds most conspicuously for districts, but 
also obtains for every other type of unit of school support. 
Inequalities in central aid. It has been the policy of most 
States since the establishment of permanent school funds to 
distribute financial aid to local districts. In some States 
such aid is also distributed from county funds. The general 
policy has been to distribute this aid on the basis of scho- 
lastic population, by dividing the total sum to be distributed
-P-A-G-E-271
EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITIES 257 
by the total number of scholastics, and apportioning the 
quotient to each scholastic in every district. 
Such a distribution is fairly equalized in terms of scho- 
lastic population, but it results in the apportionment of very 
unequal sums to the pupils of different districts actually in 
school. Thus Davis reports, for one Texas county, one dis- 
trict which received from the State $11.61 for each pupil 
enrolled, and another district which received $62.24 for each 
such pupil. Similar facts appeared in the surveys of other 
Texas counties. Swift reports, for Arkansas, a variation 
in the State apportionment per child enrolled of from $2.97 in 
Grant County to $8.40 in Pulaski County. These examples 
could be duplicated in principle among the districts and 
counties of every other State which distributes its aid upon 
the scholastic basis. 
It thus appears that, from the standpoint of enrollment, 
there are almost as great inequalities in aid received as in 
effort and ability, but here again the facts as found are what 
might have been anticipated. The real problem, after all, 
is not to eliminate all of these various inequalities, but rather 
so to fit them together as to secure more nearly equal edu- 
cational opportunities for children everywhere. As Swift 
writes: ! 
The extent to which school revenues are equalized will depend 
upon at least three things: First, equality in ability of the local 
units which furnish the revenues...second, the comparative 
effort made by such local units to provide revenues; and, third, the 
extent to which the State evens out inequalities in ability and effort 
existing among the local units. 
If, then, various kinds of inequalities are knit together 
as they should be, and are properly proportioned, there 
should result in each State an educational system which

p. 12. 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
    
   258 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
  would bring equal opportunity to every child in the State. 
If, also, the inequalities in ability, in effort, and in aid re-_ 
ceived were properly proportioned among the several 
States, the educational opportunities offered to the children 
in any one State ought to be fairly comparable to those 
offered in any other. That such equalized opportunities do 
not exist at present either within or between the States will 
be made clear in the following sections. 
Inequalities in services rendered. There are many ways 
of measuring the efficiency of the educational service actu- 
ally rendered by a school district, or a city, or a county, or a 
State. From among these, three have been selected for dis- 
cussion here because they are definitely concrete, and also 
because a quantity of evidence is available along all three 
lines. One of these measures is the proportion of its chil- 
dren of school age which a given district, city, county, or 
State is able to keep in school. Another is the length of 
school term maintained by the district or other supporting 
unit. The third is the average salary paid to teachers. 
While these are not all of the measures that should be con- 
sidered in constructing a complete index of efficiency, they 
are regarded, when taken together, as fairly accurate indica- 
tions of the type of educational service that is being rendered. 
While their discussion may seem to lead temporarily away 
from. considerations of school finance, their connection 
with our general problem is clear when it is recalled that we 
are seeking evidences of equality, or lack of equality, in the 
educational offerings of the different units of school support, 
as a check upon the adequacy of the existing supporting 
system. ‘ 
One mark of the efficiency of a school or school system, 
then, is the proportion of its children of school age who are 
kept in school. The larger the number of these children, 
other things being equal, the greater is the educational   
-P-A-G-E-273
  EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITIES 259 
opportunity afforded. Also, the fact that the school is 
succeeding in holding a large proportion of the children is 
evidence that it is rendering good service in an effective 
way. 
Data are to be found in several of the State school surveys 
to illustrate this type of variation in efficiency. Among one 
hundred Virginia counties, in 1919, three were serving edu- 
cationally less than thirty-five per cent of the white children 
of school age, while one, at the other extreme, was serving 
more than ninety-six per cent. In fifty-nine counties fewer 
than half of the white children were in school, while in forty- 
one counties more than half of them were there.!| Among 
twenty-one counties in Colorado, in 1916, one county had 
sixty-eight per cent, and another ninety-two per cent, of 
its scholastics in school. In Arizona, in 1915-16, the corre- 
sponding range of variation between the counties was from 
forty-seven per cent to eighty-two per cent; in Wyoming, in 
1915, it was from sixty-four per cent to ninety-eight per cent. 
No data have been found showing the varying percentages 
of the scholastic population actually attending school in local 
districts. Turning from the county in the other direction, 
it is interesting to observe the variation shown in the differ- 
ent States. The Bureau of Education reports that, in 1917— 
18, in Louisiana fifty-five per cent, and in Montana one hun- 
dred and sixteen per cent of the children of school age were 
attending school. The other States were ranged between 
these extremes. The “middle half” extended from seventy- 
one per cent in South Carolina to eighty-three per cent in 
Mississippi.2 It seems clear from these figures that, so far 
as States and counties are concerned, some supporting units

centage in Montana is due, of course, to the securing and holding of chil- 
dren before the beginning and after the close of the scholastic-age period.
-P-A-G-E-274
  260 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
are much. more successful than are others in keeping their 
children in school. 
Inequalities in length of term. A second basis for compar- 
ing school efficiency is the length of term. A quantity of 
material is available on this point. In the Virginia school 
survey, for example, we learn that in 1917-18 eight counties 
maintained an average school term of less than six months, 
while five other counties maintained a term of more than 
nine months. This statement applies to white schools only. 
In the same State, during the same period, the length of term 
in colored schools was under five months in ten counties and 
over nine months in two counties. There thus appears to be 
not only a variation in the amount of school provided for 
the children of different counties, but also a serious discrep- 
ancy in the amounts provided for white and colored children. 
In the Colorado school survey of 1917 | we find a range of 
from 59 days to 180 days in the length of term in rural 
schools. In graded schools the length of term was from 159 
to 189 days. Pupils attending graded schools were there- 
fore more equitably and generously served than were chil- 
dren attending rural schools. The same condition appears 
in the following statement from the Wyoming survey: ? 
In a few rural districts schools are maintained but two months, in 
others three, four, or five months, and a six months term seems to 
be relatively prevalent. Practically all cities and towns maintain 
schools nine and one half months. . . . This variation indicates that 
gross injustice is suffered by some children. 
Tn length of term, as in proportion of children in school, we 
find considerable variation between the States. In 1917-18, 
six States — Oregon, South Dakota, New York, New Jersey, 
Connecticut, and Rhode Island — had an average term of 
more. than 180 days, while two States — Arkansas and

South Carolina —had an average term of less than 120 
days. The other States ranged between these extremes.* 
Salary inequalities. A third basis of comparison is in 
terms of the salaries paid to teachers. The quality of the 
teachers determines very largely the quality of the schools, 
and the quality of teachers bears a definite relation to the 
salaries paid. To attract competent people to teach school, 
and to encourage these people to become properly trained 
and to remain in the work after their training has been en- 
riched by years of experience, requires a considerable fi- 
nancial inducement. Of course, some poorly paid teachers 
are vastly preferable to some highly paid ones, but in the 
long run the principle here stated is sound. 
In this matter of salaries one finds some rather astonishing 
variations. The New York Rural School Survey, already 
quoted, exhibits the facts for nearly 2400 rural and village 
teachers in 1920-21. ‘These facts are summarized here in 
Table XTX. 
In this table, salaries of teachers of one-teacher rural 
schools are seen to range from under $500 to over $1400 a 
year. One fourth of these teachers get less than $700, and 
another fourth get more than $900. Two-teacher school 
teachers range in salary from under $500 to $1500; one quar- 
ter getting less’ than $800 and another quarter more than 
$1000. Village elementary teachers range from $500 to 
$1800; with one quarter below $900 and another quarter over 
$1100. The median salaries were: One-teacher school teach- 
ers, $837; two-teacher school teachers, $915; and village ele- 
mentary teachers, $935. This survey does not present the 
salaries of teachers in large city schools, but that these are 
much above the level of rural and village school salaries is a 
matter of common knowledge. Data are given, however, 
for 203 village high-school teachers, who show a median

salary of $1200. High schools thus have an advantage over 
elementary schools, village elementary schools an advantage 
over rural elementary, and two-teacher schools over one- 
teacher schools, in competing for the more efficient teachers.

Not only that, but certain schools of each of these classes. 
offer from two to three times the salary offered by certain 
other schools of the same class. Surely a child who is taught 
by a $500 teacher in one school does not enjoy equality of 
educational opportunity as compared with another child 
who is taught by a $1500 teacher in another school. He is
-P-A-G-E-277
  EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITIES 263 
bound to be getting less education, or poorer education, or 
both. And the facts thus appearing in the New York State 
survey are duplicated in principle in every other survey in 
which this problem has been raised. 
Interesting salary variations also exist between the several 
States. In 1917-18, the average annual teacher’s salary in 
North Carolina was $284, and in California was $1012. Is 
it probable that less than three hundred dollars paid to each 
teacher in North Carolina purchased as much and as good 
service as was bought by more than a thousand dollars paid 
each teacher in California? The middle 50 per cent range 
was from $443 in Maine to $749 in Colorado.! Is it prob- 
able that the eleven States which paid less than four hundred 
and fifty dollars per teacher received as much and as good 
teaching service as the eleven States which paid more than 
seven hundred and fifty dollars per teacher? 
Inequalities in expenditure per pupil. Tables IV, V, 
and VI, in Chapter IV, have brought out very clearly the 
fact that some cities expend five or six times as much money 
per pupil as do other cities of the same population class. 
These tables also show that the larger cities tend toward 
a larger per-pupil expenditure than do the smaller cities. 
Tables VII and VIII show a wide range in the per-pupil ex- 
penditures in cities lying within the same geographical area; 
also that cities in the western part of the country spend 
nearly twice as much per pupil as do cities in the South. In 
Chapter IV we have also seen that, among city schools at 
least, the per-pupil expenditures are nearly twice as great 
- in the high schools as in the elementary schools. In that 
chapter, therefore, have already been presented numerous 
examples of educational inequalities. 
The New York Rural School Survey shows, for 1006 
common school districts, a range in per-pupil expenditures 
1U.S. Bureau of Education, Bulletin no. 11 (1920), p. 42. ,
-P-A-G-E-278
  264° PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
of from under $25 to over $185. One quarter cf these 
districts spent under $50, and another over $90 per school 
child. Swift reports for California that, in 1920, ‘“‘the 
expenditure per pupil varied from $25 in Fresno County to 
$119 in Alpine County”; a disproportion of nearly one to 
five. Speaking of similar variations between the States, 
the National Bureau of Education says:! 
Montana and Nevada each spend over $50 per year for each pupil 
enrolled. Almost seven millions of children are enrolled in the 
sixteen States incurring a cost of from $40 to $50 per pupil. In 
three States, Alabama, North Carolina, and Mississippi, the 
corresponding average cost is less than $10. In ten States the 
average cost varies from $10 to $20 a pupil. . . . In the highest State 
the average cost is more than seven times as much as it is in the 
lowest State. 
These figures are for the school year 1917-18. Since 
that time the per-pupil expenditures have increased con- 
siderably in all the States, but the inequalities have been 
reduced little if any. 
It is generally supposed that rural children are less favored 
than are urban children in the matter of school expenditures. 
The evidence in the-case is somewhat conflicting. Thus, in 
1917-18, the average cost per pupil for the whole United 
States, rural and urban, was $30.91. In the cities only, 
for the same year, the average ranged from $44.52 in the 
smallest class to $57.83 in the largest class. It seems evi- 
dent from these figures that, for the country as a whole, each 
city child received in 1917-18 nearly twice as much as was 
received by each country child. But that this condition 
is not universal is shown in the New York Survey. In the 
volume on Financial Support, page 63, the median expendi- 
ture in 104 city and village schools is given as $61.66 per 
pupil, as against a per-pupil expenditure of $64.82 in over a 
1U.S. Bureau of Education, Bulletin no. 11 (1920), p. 68, 
 
-P-A-G-E-279
  
EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITIES 265 
thousand one-teacher districts. As a general rule it seems 
that, where the educational service provided for rural chil- 
dren approximates in efficiency that provided for urban chil- 
dren, the cost per pupil is greater for the rural children; but 
it also appears to be very seldom that such an approach to an 
equality of opportunity can be found. 
Chapter summary. This chapter has been largely occu- 
pied with the actual presentation of data on educational 
inequalities growing out of financial inequalities inherent in 
our modern methods of school support. This evidence has 
been presented in concrete terms, the school surveys having 
been largely drawn upon as sources. No attempt has been 
made to include all of the. data available on the different 
types of educational inequalities. Only selected illustrative 
evidences have been presented. But enough has been said 
to demonstrate the existence of wide differences between 
districts, cities, counties, and States in their financial ability 
and effort put forth, and in the adequacy of the educational 
opportunities which they have provided for their children. 
The purpose of this discussion has been, of course, to 
demonstrate the need for securing a greater equity in our 
methods of public school support. There is needed a greater 
equity in the distribution of the burden, in order that the 
financial effort put forth by each supporting unit may be 
more nearly proportional to its individual ability and need. 
There is also required a greater equity in the distribution of 
the benefits, to the’end that each child, everywhere, may 
enjoy educational advantages more nearly commensurate 
with those enjoyed by other children. How to achieve this 
greater equity in the distribution of the burden and the 
benefits of public education, without at the same time sacri- 
ficing certain wholesome advantages which inhere in the ex- 
isting system of school support, is the problem offered for 
consideration in the following chapters.

  CHAPTER X 
THE UNITS OF SCHOOL SUPPORT 
Purpose of this chapter. In the chapter just finished, at- 
tention was called to the existing inequalities in education 
with reference to ability, effort, and results. These inequal- 
ities have been shown to culminate in a school system that 
is far from democratic, if by “democratic” we mean that 
children who are reared in different places shall have fairly 
equal opportunities for educational advancement. 
In the present chapter, and also in the one next succeeding 
it, we must consider the ways and means that have been 
proposed for reducing, or possibly for eliminating, these 
various inequalities. This problem will present two different 
phases. On the one hand, provision must be made for dis- 
tributing the burden of school support more equitably 
among the different supporting units, so that each unit will 
contribute its appropriate share. On the other hand, there 
must be secured such a distribution of the benefits of this 
better equalized support that each group, and each member 
of each unit-group, will receive its appropriate share. The 
first of these phases has been chosen for consideration in 
this chapter. 
Distributing the burden. The aspect of the distribution 
problem to be raised in this chapter concerns the apportion- 
ment of the burden among those who have to bear it. Since 
the bulk of school support comes from taxation, this phase 
becomes in reality the problem of properly distributing tax 
burdens for schools. There are two distinct aspects of this 
problem of distributing the burden of taxation. One has to 
do with the amount of tax support that should be con- 
tributed by each supporting unit — district, township or
-P-A-G-E-283
  UNITS OF SCHOOL SUPPORT 269 
county, State, and Nation. The other is concerned with 
securing the fair apportionment of this burden upon all 
legitimate taxation sources — real estate, personal property, 
tangible wealth, intangible wealth, etc. Only the first of 
these aspects will be considered in this chapter. The sec- 
ond, in so far as it concerns taxation for schools, will be re- 
served for discussion in Chapter XII. 
The problem of distribution as discussed in this chapter 
is mainly a problem of determining the proportion of the 
total amount of money required for school support that 
should be furnished by each local and central unit. What 
proportion should be borne by the district, by the township. 
or county, by the State, and by the Nation? ‘To this ques- 
tion different answers have been given by State legislatures 
and by educational authorities, the answers depending upon 
the adjustments made among the three principles now to be 
discussed. 
Three principles of distribution. Before taking up the 
two large problems of distributing the burdens and the bene- 
fits of school support, in this chapter and the one following, 
we must pause to consider three principles which, singly or 
together, will underlie any solution of either problem that 
may be offered. These principles are fundamental to the 
solution of both the problem of selecting the units of school 
support and apportioning the burden among them, and the 
problem of distributing the money thus raised among the 
different local supporting units. 
The principles referred to are those of aid, stimulation, 
and equalization. The last two of these principles, in par- 
ticular, are involved in the determination of a controversy 
now prevailing as to the best distribution of the school tax 
burden. One group of school finance authorities appears to 
stress the principle of equalization almost to the exclusion of 
stimulation, and to urge in consequence the development of 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
    s 
270 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
central to the practical exclusion of local supporting units. 
Another group stresses both stimulation and equalization, 
and urges a larger participation by both central and local 
units. The arguments of each group will appear farther 
along in this chapter, but in order to understand this con- 
troversy, and also in order to evaluate the various plans 
proposed for distributing both the burdens and the benefits, 
we must first take up for consideration these underlying 
principles. 
The principle of aid. The tendency of most of the States 
has always been to place the major part of the burden of 
school support upon local units, especially upon the school 
districts. Early in our national history almost all of the 
burden was so placed. During the first quarter of the last 
century, however, the States themselves began to participate 
in the support of schools, by apportioning to the local dis- 
tricts the income from invested money obtained from the 
sale of public lands. The origin of these invested funds, 
and their history and present importance, will receive more 
+ extended discussion in the next chapter. 
At this point it is important to note, first, that the per- 
manent school funds made possible the beginnings of State 
central participation in a large way; and, second, that the 
a rom these Canale wag ine opporticnee eee the idea | of aiding the local communities in their support of schools. 
At first this aid was small, even by comparison with the then 
low total cost of schools, for only a portion of the school 
lands had been converted into income-bearing investments. 
It was expected, however, that sooner or later the income 
from this source would suffice for most, if not all, of the total 
cost of public school maintenance. 
This original idea, that the function of the State was to 
aid local units in their support of schools until, at some 
future date, the State itself could take over the total burden,
-P-A-G-E-285
UNITS OF SCHOOL SUPPORT Q71 
has persisted down to the present time. Evidence of its 
persistence is found in the frequent use of the phrase “State 
aid” in our modern school laws and educational literature. 
Other similar expressions, denoting the same persistence, are 
“high-school aid,” ‘“‘rural aid,” and “aid for special sub- 
jects.” The idea has even been taken over and applied 
to the use of money from county sources, giving us the 
parallel expression, “‘county aid.” The national fund for 
the promotion of vocational education under the Smith- 
Hughes law is also administered in part on the aid prin- 
ciple. 
The principle of aid has continued to function long after 
it has become apparent that the income from invested school 
funds is insufficient to meet even the State’s share of the 
burden of school support, and has been applied in the use of 
money derived from State and county taxes. By the middle 
of the past century, however, it has begun to give way to the 
principle of local stimulation, and in recent years its place 
has been largely taken by the principle of equalization. 
To-day, these two other principles have absorbed it almost 
altogether, although the word, as has been shown, still per- 
sists. 
The principle of stimulation. The expectation of early 
leaders that the growth of the State school funds would some 
time make possible the more or less complete State support 
of education without reference to local taxation, failed to 
materialize. Instead, it was found necessary to encourage 
local communities to do more for their own schools. Early 
efforts to use force in this direction proved wholly ineffectual. 
Consequently, a new policy came into being, of purchasing 
greater local effort by making the apportionment of State 
aid at least partly contingent upon what the community 
was doing for itself. This policy was based upon the prin- 
ciple of stimulation. ’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
  272 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
Considering the obvious services which this principle was 
capable of rendering, it was strangely slow to develop, even 
after the need for continued and enlarged dependence upon 
local units of support had become abundantly clear. Reisner, 
speaking of the period before 1890, writes: ! “The power 
which the State possessed to improve educational facilities 
through making State contributions dependent on local 
effort was little appreciated during this period and used 
hardly at all.”” Once started, however, the principle spread 
with great rapidity, and is responsible for no small part of the 
growth of local participation during the last thirty years. 
The principle of equalization. The latest principle to 
develop has been that of equalization. In fact, this prin- 
ciple is still in its nascent stages, and has not yet achieved 
the recognition accorded to the others. It is the most dis- 
cussed of the three in current educational literature, but it 
is the least recognized in legislation and in the mind of the 
general public. However, it is rapidly finding a more or less 
satisfactory expression in the laws of several progressive 
States. 
While the origins of this principle are somewhat obscure, 
it seems to gain its present impetus from the evidences of the 
undemocratic character of our educational systems which 
have been summarized in the chapter preceding. The school 
surveys, together with other studies of our modern methods 
of school financial support, have declared in forceful terms 
the existence of educational inequalities of many sorts. 
These declarations seem to be mainly responsible for the in- 
creasing emphasis upon the principle of equalization; an 
emphasis so great in some quarters as almost completely to 
efface the earlier principles of aid and stimulation. 
The effect of the rise of this latest principle has been to 
revive discussion of the need for greater centralized support.

  UNITS OF SCHOOL SUPPORT 273 
As the principle of stimulation has tended to increase the 
participation of local supporting units, so the principle of 
equalization is tending to increase that of central units. 
The two principles necessarily lead in opposite directions. 
This emphasis upon centralized support arises inevitably 
from the fact that equalization requires the pooling by local 
units of their resources and efforts, while the central units 
offer the best available media through which this pooling 
can be accomplished. 
Local versus central supporting units. The recognized 
units of school support were enumerated in Chapter IX, and 
have again been referred to in the sections just preceding. 
They comprise local districts, both rural and urban, town- 
ships, counties, or other intermediate units, the States, and 
(at present only to a very limited degree) the Nation. Each, 
with reference to the one above it, is a local supporting unit, 
while with reference to the one below it each is a central 
supporting unit. Generally, however, the districts, town- 
ships, counties, etc., are regarded as local units, and the 
States and Nation as central units. 
The problem of this chapter, specifically stated, is that of 
apportioning the burden among these several units in ac- 
cordance with the three principles just discussed; or, better, 
in accordance with such of these principles as it seems wise to 
maintain. A different distribution of the burden will result, 
it is clear, if we accept all three principles than if we accept 
only one or two. Differences in emphasis upon these prin- 
ciples will also lead to differences in distribution. Stimula- 
tion, for example, implies a considerable dependence upon 
local supporting units, while equalization involves primarily 
the action of central units. The principles which are 
adopted, and the relative emphasis placed upon each, will 
therefore determine the apportionment of the burden of 
support among the several units.
-P-A-G-E-288
  274 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
The main practical problem in this connection centers 
around the participation of the local units, especially of the 
districts. Some authorities, as will appear later on, would 
virtually abandon the local district as a supporting unit and 
would concentrate the burden very largely upon the State. 
The reason given is that local units differ so widely in their 
interest in schools and in their ability to sustain them that 
anything like an: equality of educational facilities can be 
secured only through State action. The evidences for these 
inequalities have already been presented in Chapter IX. 
Other writers, however, oppose this view, and believe that 
local initiative and responsibility should be encouraged even 
at the cost of failure to achieve complete equalization of 
opportunity. These writers hold that considerable de- 
pendence upon local support results in greater public interest 
in education and in a more careful administration of local 
school expenditures. Too great a centralization of school 
support, it is held, is likely to retard the activity of the more 
progressive districts. The result would be to remove from 
. the field the advantages of the leadership and the example 
of such communities. It is also feared that centralized 
support, if carried too far, would tend toward educational 
stagnation and possible decline. Educational vitality and 
progress are attributed in no small degree to the influence of 
local pride and sense of responsibility, despite the fact that so 
many local communities seem to be destitute of both. A 
form of equalization which involves a “leveling up,” in the 
sense of bringing backward communities nearer to the 
normal level, is strongly endorsed; but equalization which 
“levels down” the progressive districts to the status of the 
average districts, or which is likely to bring a reaction when 
its original impetus subsides, is severely arraigned by these 
people. 
Present distribution of support. During the school year 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
  UNITS OF SCHOOL SUPPORT 275 
1919-20, about 72 per cent of the total burden of school sup- 
port was carried by local units, about 11 per cent by coun- 
ties, and about 17 per cent by States. The percentage borne 
by national sources was insignificant. But while these aver- 
ages existed, in point of fact district support ranged from 
none at all in Maryland to 96 per cent in Kansas; county 
support ranged from none in Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, 
Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsyl- 
vania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, and Vermont, to 
75 per cent in New Mexico; and State support ranged from 
1.5 per cent in Iowa to 54 per cent in Texas. In five States 
more than 40 per cent of school support came from the 
State; in fourteen States the State supplied less than 10 per 
cent of the total. More than 40 per cent was drawn from 
county sources in seven States; less than 10 per cent came 
from the county in twenty-three States. Seven States de- 
rived more than 90 per cent of their school support from 
local districts; two States derived less than 10 per cent from 
these units. 
Not only does the emphasis differ, but the mode of com- 
bining State, county, and local support is also very different 
in different States. Alabama ranks high in State support, 
medium in county, and low in district support. Illinois 
ranks low in State, low in county, and very high in local dis- 
trict support. New Mexico ranks low in State, high in 
county, and low in district support. North Carolina ranks 
medium in all three. Texas ranks high in State support, 
low in county, and medium in the support derived from 
local districts. There is thus no typical combination, 
although the tendency is, where a State stresses one of 
these units, for it to press relatively lightly on the others.! 
Recent tendencies. From 1890 to 1920 there was an 
almost continuous decline in the percentage of State support 
1U.S. Bureau of Education, Bulletin no. 29 (1922), p. 25.
-P-A-G-E-290
  276 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
of education, and a corresponding rise in the percentage 
derived from local units. In 1890, the State furnished about 
24 per cent, and the local units about 68 per cent. In 1918, 
about 17 per cent came from the States, and about 77 per 
cent from local sources. It will be noted that this tendency 
applies to the percentages, and not to the absolute amounts 
of money raised by central and local units. There was 
actually during this period a great increase in the amount of 
money flowing from both State and local sources, but the 
growth of State support did not keep pace with the growth of 
local support. The result has been an increased emphasis 
upon the school as a local institution. Commenting on this, 
Swift says: 1 
Despite a certain degree of progress in matters of centralization, 
administration, and control, and despite utterances of educational 
theorists and court decisions to the contrary, schools in the United 
States continue to be in fact local institutions. ... Local support 
has steadily gained ground both in theory and practice until it has 
become little less than a fetish. The suggestion that the State levy 
a school tax sufficient to pay for the major part of school costs 
would to-day meet with violent opposition in nearly every State in 
the Union. 
It is possible that since 1920 the trend has set in the op- 
posite direction. Much has been made of the equalization 
principle since that date, and several States have passed 
legislation designed to increase the proportion of State sup- 
port. Several others have increased the proportion coming 
from the counties. A distinct tendency to emphasize central 
support of schools seems to be a mark of both educational 
theory and school legislation in this third decade of the 
twentieth century. 
State participation. The State offers a convenient start- 
ing-point for a discussion of the proportionate participation 
1 Swift, F. H., in School Review, vol. 29 (1921), pp. 540-41.
-P-A-G-E-291
  UNITS OF SCHOOL SUPPORT 277 
of the various supporting units. The part to be taken by the 
State naturally indicates the part or parts remaining to be 
assumed by local units. Also, the major interest of students 
of school finance now centers in the question of State partici- 
pation. Still further, the State being the recognized re- 
sponsible agent for the establishment and upkeep of public 
schools, it follows that the State will determine the share to 
be assumed by other units as well as its own. 
The beginning of State participation, as has been stated, 
was in the form of aid to local districts. Later it became an 
expression of the principle of stimulation, in that State funds 
were used, at least in part, as rewards for special accomplish- 
ments by local units. Still more recently, it has been the 
principal means for securing equalization of educational 
opportunity. These three principles underlie any plan 
which may be adopted for apportioning State funds to local 
schools; but they also determine whether, and to what ex- 
tent, State support should be used at all. This latter feature 
it is which is significant at this point. If the aid principle 
alone is to be served, then the extent of needed State partici- 
pation is indefinite, and largely a matter of convenience. 
The same is true if the stimulation principle is made the only 
object of State efforts. If, however, the principle of equaliz- 
ing financial differences and resultant differences in oppor- 
tunity is established as the sole purpose of State support, 
then the logic of the situation would practically eliminate 
all subordinate units and put the entire burden upon the 
State. If equalization on a national scale is what is wanted, 
then the Nation would take the place of the State and all 
other subsidiary units. Perfect national equalization means 
almost complete national support; perfect equalization 
within a State means almost complete State support. If, 
however, the purpose of the State is both to equalize and 
stimulate and incidentally to aid local units, then the extent
-P-A-G-E-292
278 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
of State participation must be worked out with reference tu 
the extent of inequalities in local ability and effort. 
There are few if any authorities on school finance to-day 
who would advocate so extreme a measure as complete State 
support, and none at all who even suggest complete support 
from national sources. Keith and Bagley,! however, believe 
that “eventually the logical extension of this principle [of 
State taxation for schools] will carry the taxing unit to 
boundaries no less circumscribed than those of the Nation 
itself.” Swift, who has already been quoted as emphasizing 
‘the need for much greater equalization of educational oppor- 
tunity, comes near to urging complete State support when 
he writes: ? 
Upon the basis of the present conditions it seems safe to say that 
the proportion of the cost which should be borne by the State 
should range between 65 and 75 percent.... It is possible that it 
might constitute 80, 90, or even 95 per cent of the total expenditure 
for public schools. 
Most writers, however, appear to urge a degree of State 
participation which is consistent with the principles both of 
equalization and of stimulation. The theory underlying 
this policy of combined central and local effort has been 
stated by Cubberley thus: * 
The duty of the State is to secure for all as high a minimum of 
good instruction as possible, but not to reduce all to this minimum; 
to equalize the advantages to all as nearly as can be done with the 
resources at hand; to place a premium on those local efforts which 
will enable communities to rise above the legal minimum as far as 
possible; and to encourage communities to extend their educational 
energies to new and desirable undertakings.

  UNITS OF SCHOOL SUPPORT 279 
Updegraff, in the financial program mapped out for the 
State of New York in the Rural School Survey of that State, 
places even greater emphasis upon local and correspondingly 
less emphasis upon central support. He writes:! 
We must expect, ...as a principle of the financial administra- 
tion of schools, that local support shall be fundamental in any sys- 
tem that may be established. It does not follow, however, that 
school support should be entirely local.... The State should al- 
ways do something to stimulate every school district to do its best. 
Rewards ought to be granted likewise to school districts, teachers, 
and pupils who do particularly meritorious pieces of work.... It 
is therefore fundamental in State aid that we leave final decision to 
the local communities, and allow them to choose what they think is 
best. In the doing of this we shall have stronger agencies in the 
making of a better government and a better society.... The sys: 
tem of State aid which does not take cognizance of local contacts 
and which does not stimulate local interest does not promote the 
highest efficiency either in the local or central officers or in the 
system as a whole. 
In line with this latter viewpoint, that State support 
should be combined with a large amount of local support, 
several authorities have attempted to fix upon a definite per- 
centage of the entire school burden which the State, in their 
judgment, should assume. The State School Survey Report 
of Alabama says: “It is generally agreed, and it is an ac- 
cepted principle of the United States Bureau of Education, 
that the State should provide funds equivalent to about one 
third of the required funds.” ? The same proportion is re- 
commended (also by representatives of the Bureau of Edu- 
cation) in the Colorado and South Dakota State Surveys. 
The Virginia State Survey Commission made approximately 
the same recommendation. Another plan, represented in

    280 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
the finance legislation of California and Massachusetts, is 
that of setting aside from State sources a specified amount 
per pupil or per teacher, or both, for each school in the 
State. This plan involves a flexibility in the proportionate 
amount of State support depending upon the activity of 
local units. 
A recent writer on this subject maintains that there can 
be no fixed proportion determined for State participation 
which will apply to all States, or even to the same State at 
different periods. His view is that, since the purpose of 
State support is to diminish inequalities in local support 
and to stimulate local communities to greater effort, the 
amounts of stimulation and equalization needed will deter- 
mine the necessary amount of State participation. We 
quote again from Updegraff: 1 
It is difficult to determine in just what proportion the support of 
local schools should be distributed between the State and local 
governments. Since the justification of State aid rests largely on 
the differences in conceptions of the various districts as to the 
proper standards and scope of schools, it would seem to follow that 
the amount of State aid would be somewhat in direct proportion to 
the extent of differences in both respects. If that be true, it is evi- 
dent then that the proportion cannot be well determined for any 
State until a careful study of the conditions in these respects has 
been made. It would seem, too, that a correct proportion for one 
State would not be right for another. There would probably be so 
wide a variation among the various States that it would not be 
possible to express the proportion in a single figure. 
Other angles of the question of State support, including the 
units to which State aid be apportioned and the proper bases 
of distribution, will be considered farther along in this book. 
Local district participation. Aside from the State, the 
local school district is the long-established unit of support. 
In fact the district long antedated the State in this respect; 
1 New York Rural School Survey, volume on Financial Support, p. 116.
-P-A-G-E-295
  UNITS OF SCHOOL SUPPORT 281 
especially if we regard the New England town as being in 
substance a district unit, with which it is closely analogous. 
There are, in the United States, several different kinds of 
school districts. The most nearly universal are the common 
or rural districts, and the urban or independent districts. 
The former are defined and established in the general school 
codes of the several States. The latter as a rule originated 
in special legislation or special charter provisions, but in 
many of the States these, as well as the ordinary districts, 
are now defined in the general codes. 
During the first half-century of our national life the dis- 
trict was practically the only active unit for school support. 
During the next half-century the State grew into prominence 
as a supporting unit, and the county or some other inter- 
mediate unit achieved considerable recognition. Since 
1890, as has been shown, the proportionate participation of 
the local units has outgrown that of the States. 
With respect to the extent of local district participation, 
as in the case of State participation, there are contradictory 
opinions. Some writers regard our present dependence upon 
district support as responsible for most of our educational 
ills, and would remedy the situation by practically wiping 
out the responsible source. Others would stimulate each 
and every local district to its very best effort. Practically 
all writers and up-to-date legislators are agreed, however, 
that in most States the proportionate financial burdens of 
the districts are now too large. The question is, whither to 
transfer these burdens. 
Examples of these diverse viewpoints with regard to dis- 
trict participation are found in the Arkansas and New York 
State School Surveys. In the former survey, Swift recom- 
mends “unqualifiedly the abolition of school districts,” and 
further states: !

The conditions revealed . . . should be sufficient to convince the 
most ardent admirer of and believer in the district system that, as 
long as the district system is maintained, the inequalities in the 
wealth of the districts are so great as to make impossible any sig- 
nificant approach to equality in school funds and consequently in 
educational opportunity for the children of Arkansas.... The 
condition of Arkansas, so far as public education is concerned, is 
pathological. It cannot be cured without a major operation. The 
major operation it requires is the abolition of the school district as a 
unit of taxation, organization, and administration. 
The other view is sponsored by Updegraff in the New 
York Rural School Survey Report, in the following words: ! 
! 1, Local support is fundamental. 
2. The local units for the support of schools should contain, in so 
far as is practicable, enough property taxable for school purposes to 
raise that portion of the expenses of the school which it is believed 
should be borne by the local districts without an undue burden 
upon the owners of property. 
8. Some portion of the support of local schools should come from 
the State government, the amount being dependent upon certain 
factors, exact standards for which have not been scientifically de- 
termined, but which will vary in the different States. 
This latter view appears to be the prevalent view at the 
present time. It is commonly held that the district has an 
important part to play in school maintenance, but it is also 
commonly held that the part now played by the districts in 
most States is far too large, and is responsible for the most 
glaring of the existing financial and educational inequalities. 
Just what part should be taken by the district, and just what 
provision should be made for taking care of the remaining 
portion of school support, are questions that will receive 
attention in subsequent paragraphs. 
Participation by an intermediate unit. An outstanding 
feature of public school finance, since 1900, has been the de- 
1 New York Rural School Survey, volume on Financial Support, p. 11% 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
  UNITS OF SCHOOL SUPPORT 283 
velopment of a supporting unit intermediate between the 
State and the local district. A very early form of this unit, 
which still persists, was the New England town. In a few 
North Central States it appeared in the form of the town- 
ship, and in the East-Southern States in the form of the 
county, during the third quarter of the past century. The 
marked growth of this intermediate unit out-distanced all 
other forms. In 1920 the county participated in the support 
of schools in 35 States; the proportion of the total burden 
borne by this unit ranging from 0.2 per cent in Arkansas to 
75 per cent in New Mexico. 
County participation in school support ordinarily appears 
as an aspect of a larger development known as the “county- 
unit” plan. This plan involves important supervisory and 
administrative changes in county school organization, as 
well as an increase of the county’s share in financial support. 
The discussion here is properly concerned only with the 
financial phases of the movement. The problem, as in the 
cases of the State and the district, is to determine the pro- 
portion of total school expenditures which the county ought 
to bear. 
Both opinions and practices differ widely as the extent of 
county financial participation which is desirable. The range 
of variation in practice has just been shown. Differences in 
theory are abundantly exemplified in the State school sur- 
veys. Thus Swift, in the Arkansas Survey, recommends 
complete dependence upon the State and county and the 
abandonment of the district unit. The county, it is stated, 
should assume from thirty-five to forty-five per cent of the 
total cost of schools in Arkansas. Representing the opposite 
extreme, Updegraff, in the New York Rural School Survey, 
eliminates the county from his recommendations and puts 
the whole financial burden upon the State and the district.

-P-A-G-E-298
  284 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
Certain other surveys (e.g., Alabama, Colorado, Maryland, 
Wyoming, etc.) provide for the participation of all three 
supporting units, and hence make a demand upon the county 
that is between the proposals of Updegraff and Swift. 
Justification of the county as a unit of school support lies 
in the theory that such a unit is at once central and local. 
It comprises, as a rule, an area sufficiently large and diversi- 
fied to make possible the ironing-out of the most extreme 
differences in local district ability and effort. Thus it par- 
takes of the virtues of the State as an instrument for equal- 
ization, but it has one point of superiority to the State in that 
it is closer to the people. It thus enlists local initiative and 
stimulates local responsibility. In these ways it shares the 
advantages of district support. The county is not generally 
regarded as an effective substitute for the State, and seldom 
for the district, but it is utilized to mitigate the remoteness 
of the former and the extreme inequalities existing in the 
latter. 
National participation. In 1920, only about one twentieth 
of the total burden of school support in the United States was 
carried by the Nation asa unit. The total amount contributed 
from national resources approximated sixty-two millions of 
dollars.1_ The chief accounts were the percentum funds, the 
federal forest reserve funds, the federal mineral royalty 
grants, the Smith-Lever and Smith-Hughes subventions for 
promoting industrial education, the financing of schools in 
the District of Columbia, and the cost for schools in Alaska 
and for the Indians in Oklahoma.? Several of these funds 
will require a word of explanation. 
The percentum funds are a percentage of the income ob-

tained from the sale of national landholdings within present 
State boundaries. This ‘source is now relatively small. 
The forest reserve funds comprise twenty-five per cent of 
the income from national forest preserves, and are paid to 
the counties within which these preserves lie. The mineral 
royalty grant was authorized in 1920, and began to function 
a year later. It provides for a percentage return, to the 
States having federal landholdings, of royalties received from 
the working of non-metallic mineral deposits. This source 
promises to become of considerable value to the schools. 
The Smith-Lever and Smith-Hughes subventions are ex- 
plained below. 
Four periods in our development. Reisner describes four 
stages in the development of national agencies for school 
support in the United States.! 
From 1789 to 1828 was the period of aristocratic political 
control, when education was not considered seriously by 
either the Nation or the State. Politics were dominated by 
the aristocracy, and the political motive for educating the 
masses was in abeyance. During this period, however, the 
Nation contributed a large share of the magnificent land 
endowment for education to the States which is described at 
length in Chapter XII. Section 16 in each township laid 
down by the new land surveys was given up for the support 
of schools; not, however, so much for the purpose of encour- 
aging public education as for the attraction of settlers into 
the new domain. 
From the entrance of Jacksonian influences in 1828 to the 
Civil War we have a period of sectional dispute and strife. 
During this period whatever impetus to national support of 
education might have been given by the political rise of the 
proletariat was counterbalanced by the jealousy with which 
were guarded the prerogatives of the States.

No., 1922.

  286 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
Following the Civil War, until 1890, is a period of “ma- 
terial growth and cultural unification.” The War had de- 
cided the question of sectionalism, and the new inventions — 
the railroads, the telephone and telegraph — assisted in the 
development of a new national consciousness. During this 
period the Nation for the first time really became one. The 
period was marked by the establishment of the National 
Bureau of Education, in 1869 (originating as a Department 
of Education in 1867), and by the agitations consequent 
upon the Hoar Bill of 1870 and the Blair Bill of 1881. Both 
of these bills were designed to bring national financial aid to 
education in the States, especially in the South. Both were 
lost. 
The period since 1890 is described as one of growing con- 
sciousness in education. Its chief manifestations have been 
the Smith-Lever Act of 1914, which provided for the support 
of extension work in industrial education, and the Smith- 
Hughes Act of 1917, which provided important financial aid 
for vocational education in the public schools. The allot- 
ment of this aid was made contingent upon each State 
raising a corresponding sum for the same purpose, and in 
this way a new principle, that of stimulation, was intro- 
duced in the educational functioning of the Nation. The 
Smith-Hughes funds are used solely for the training and 
payment of teachers of vocational subjects. 
The new demand for national aid. The most recent and 
most far-reaching of all of the efforts to establish national 
participation in school support is the Towner-Sterling Bill, 
which has now been before Congress for several years. This 
bill was sponsored by the National Education Association. 
It proposes the establishment of a Department of Education 
with a Secretary of Education in the President’s Cabinet, 
in place of the present Bureau in the Department of the 
Interior, and the distribution of about a hundred million
-P-A-G-E-301
UNITS OF SCHOOL SUPPORT 287 
dollars to the States for specified educational purposes. 
This bill has been stifled several times, and several times 
restored to a brief lease of life. Up to the present, however, 
it has served chiefly as a rallying-point for those who favor a 
larger national participation in educational support, and as 
a target for the enemies of this policy. 
National participation originated, as indicated, in accord- 
ance with the principle of aid. The land bonuses and other 
donations, while generally bestowed upon the States, were 
intended to assist local districts in their maintenance of 
schools. Recently, in the Smith-Lever and Smith-Hughes 
subsidies, and likewise in the subventions proposed by the 
Sterling-Towner Bill, the principle of stimulation“has been 
recognized. The bonuses here provided are apportioned to 
the States upon condition that each State provide a dollar 
of its own for every dollar received from the Nation. This 
combined State and national bonus is then distributed to 
local districts in part according to the efforts of the districts. 
The result is to stimulate both States and districts to ex- 
traordinary efforts. 
Current emphasis upon the movement toward a larger 
national participation is also based upon the principle of 
equalization. It is pointed out that States, as well as coun- 
ties and districts, differ greatly in their relative ability to 
support good schools. Even though each State should 
achieve complete equalization of education within its bor- 
ders, there would still exist very serious inequalities between 
the States themselves. Either the educational opportunities 
offered by some States would greatly exceed those offered by 
others, or the efforts required of some would have to be 
much greater than those required of others. A larger pro- 
portion of national support is urged in order to reduce these 
inequalities between the States. For example, note the fol- 
lowing quotation from Swift: + 
1 Swift, F. H., in American School Board Journal, December, 1922, p. 46. 
 
-P-A-G-E-302
  288 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
If the Federal Government is to provide annual funds for public 
schools, let it bring together all the resources it can and combine the 
same into a national equalization fund. The quota granted to any 
State should depend upon the latter’s ability to provide school 
revenue as denoted by its wealth per school child or teacher 
employed, and upon its effort as compared with that of other 
States to provide educational facilities. ... All data at hand show 
conclusively not only that education is neither universal, equal, 
nor free, but that inequalities in wealth among our States are so 
great as to seem to preclude the possibility of maintaining anything 
like uniform systems of education. 
But this doctrine of enlarged national participation has 
also its opponents. In part, the opposition comes from im- 
portant vested interests, both educational and financial. 
In part it arises from the ever-recurring doctrine of States’ 
rights. Besides these grounds of opposition, there are fears 
expressed of the creation of a national educational bureau- 
cracy, of a wastage of funds and of a general inefficiency, 
and of a diminution of local and State interest in educational 
development.! Should education ever come to be recognized 
as a predominantly national concern, in the sense that it is 
supported in large part by the Nation, it will probably be 
only after a period of exceptionally violent controversy. 
Varying combinations and emphases. ‘There are various 
possible ways of combining the several supporting units that 
have now been described; and there are also various relative 
emphases that may be given to these units. Thus, of the 
four units mentioned, there can be combined into a support- 
ing system any two, or any three, or all four. The systems 
found are usually composed of two or three units, the Nation 
not yet receiving serious consideration by most authorities. 
Its activities as yet are minor and incidental. Again, the 
burden of support can be distributed fairly evenly among the 
1Satton, W. S., in American School Board Journal, December, 1921, 
pp. 33-35. 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
  UNITS OF SCHOOL SUPPORT 289 
selected units, or any meraber of any combination can be 
given the major portion with corresponding lightening of the 
burden upon the others. 
We find exactly these variations, both in the recommenda- 
tions made by students of school finance and in the school 
laws and practices of the different States. The variations in 
practice have been summarized in an earlier section of this 
chapter. Notice must now be taken of the theoretical 
aspects of this subject, as revealed particularly in the re- 
ports of the State school surveys. 
Recommendations of the school surveys. The reports 
of the State school surveys offer various consistent and in- 
consistent proposals respecting the number, identity, and 
proportionate participation of the several units of school 
support. Among these various proposals, however, three 
specific types of recommendations stand out distinctly, 
because of their definiteness, and also because of their re- 
semblances and contradictions. 
Up to 1920, the surveys conducted by the National Bureau 
of Education recommended, in general, the participation 
of three supporting units — districts, counties, and States. 
These recommendations occur in the Survey Reports for 
Alabama, ! Colorado,? South Dakota,’ and Wyoming.*- The 
clearest statement of the Bureau’s view appears in the Col- 
orado Report, as follows: 
The State should provide ...an amount large enough to make 
its apportionment fund approximately one third of the total 
expenditure for the maintenance of schools. . . . 
The county as a unit should contribute an amount large enough, 
with the State apportionment, to maintain all schools in the county

at least the minimum term and at the minimum salary required by 
laweisi.'« 
The local districts should have the power and should be en- 
couraged to levy local taxes for special purposes in advance of the 
minimum requirements of the county board of education, and should 
raise money by taxes or bonds for all permanent improvements. 
An interesting variation of the principle enunciated by 
the Bureau of Education, that the State should bear about a 
third of the total burden of school support, is found in the 
report of the Virginia School Survey Commission. This 
was an independent commission, headed by Professor Inglis, 
of Harvard University. Its recommendations are as fol- 
lows: 
In addition to suggesting that the rates of assessment and valu- 
ation be raised and equalized throughout the State, the commission 
recommends: 
1. That the State adopt a minimum standard for the average 
cost of education, that standard at present to be not less than 
fifteen cents per unit of the aggregate days’ attendance for instruc- 
tion costs (teachers’ salaries), nor less than twenty-five cents per 
unit of the aggregate days’ attendance for all school costs. 
2. That legal provision be made for State instructional funds to 
be determined annually or biennially on the basis of not less than 
eight cents per unit of the aggregate days’ attendance, seven 
eighths of that fund to be set aside as a general instructional fund 
to be apportioned to all counties and cities, and one eighth to be 
set aside as a special relief fund to needy counties and cities... . 
8. That the constitutional limit on local taxation be repealed.t 
The second group of survey recommendations to which 
reference has been made are the work of Professor Swift.

orado,! and Oklahoma.” Swift’s reactions to the recom- 
mendations that have been quoted from the Bureau of Edu- 
cation reports, as well as the bases of his own recommenda- 
tions, appear in the following remarks: * 
A question of supreme importance is what proportion of the 
total revenues for common schools should be furnished by the 
State. Monahan and Cook suggested that the State should fur- 
nish approximately one third. The same ratio has been suggested 
by various other writers. It would be just as sound a priori to 
suggest one half or one tenth. It is unnecessary, however, to be 
satisfied with any such a priori or arbitrary answer to our question. 
A scientific answer can be arrived at by determining (1) what items 
of school expenditure are most important in determining edu- 
cational equality or inequality; (2) by assigning all such items of 
expenditure and support to the care of the State; (3) by ascertain- 
ing what per cent the total cost of the sum of such items will 
constitute of the total expenditure for common schools... . - 
Upon the basis of present conditions it seems safe to say that the 
proportion of the total expenditure to be borne by the State would 
range far beyond the suggested one third, perhaps leaving little 
more than one third to be borne by the local unit. It is doubtful 
whether at the present time it would be practicable, even if possible, 
for any State to assume at once the full measure of responsibility 
we have suggested. Of one thing we may be sure, namely, that 
it would be unwise to establish for the United States as a whole, 
or even for one State, an inflexible percentage division between 
State and local units. 
Swift’s general plan of adjustment involves the abandon- 
ment of the local school district as a unit of financial support, 
and concentration upon the State and the county. Of these 
two units, the State should bear the major share. A brief 
statement of his view is as follows: 4

Place upon the State the responsibility of furnishing funds to 
provide every school with enough money to pay a minimum salary 
to every teacher for an entire school year of uniform length, and, 
‘further, place upon the State the responsibility for providing the 
materials directly related to instruction and the money necessary 
to guarantee the scientific supervision of every school. 
Updegraff’s reports of studies made in New York ! and 
Pennsylvania ? constitute the third group of interest to us 
here. Like Swift, this writer recommends only two support- 
ing units, but his units are the State and the local district. 
No doubt the fact that these States are in the New England 
section of the country explains, in part, at least, this omission 
of the county. Also, like Swift, Updegraff believes that no 
definite proportion of the total burden, a proportion that 
would hold good in any and every State, can be assigned to 
either supporting unit. He bases his distribution, however, 
in the case of general aid, upon the relative equalized valua- 
tions per teacher employed, and upon the relative equalized 
tax rates, in the different districts. The proportion of State 
support would thus vary from district to district within the 
same State, and would probably vary in the same district 
from time to time. Inasmuch as the question of proportion 
is thus bound up with the question of distribution or ap- 
portionment, a detailed study of Updegraff’s plan will be 
postponed for consideration in the next chapter. 
Chapter summary. ‘This chapter has dealt with the iden- 
tification of the units of school financial support, and with 
the distribution of school support among them. It has re- 
vealed a condition of contradiction in theory and of variation 
in practice. One source of these inconsistencies has been 
found in the varying conditions and traditions existing in the

different States. Another source is the lack of agreement 
among authorities in school finance as to the relative im- 
portance of the three principles of aid, stimulation, and 
equalization. There have been found, however, two or 
three distinguishable tendencies in the field. 
The theoretical aspects of the problem have been seen to 
rest upon the three fundamental principles just mentioned. 
According as one or another of these principles is stressed 
will the selection of the supporting units, and the distribu- 
tion of the burden between them, be determined. Emphasis 
upon the principle of equalization means emphasis upon 
central units of support. Emphasis upon stimulation 
means emphasis upon local supporting units. In the 
minds of many students the most vital problem in this en- 
tire field at the present time is that of determining the em- 
phasis that should be given to these respective principles 
and units. The prevailing opinion seems to be that these 
matters must be considered separately, and perhaps settled 
differently, for individual States. Also, they are seen to be 
definitely connected with the problem of the apportionment 
of aid, to be considered in the next chapter. 
TOPICS FOR INVESTIGATION AND DISCUSSION 
1. What proportion of public school costs in your State is carried by the 
State itself? By local districts? By counties or other similar units? 
2. What tendencies are evident in your State at present, affecting the 
selection of supporting units and the distribution of the burden of 
support among them? 
3. What changes in units, or in the apportionment of burdens, or in 
both, would you make in your State? 
4. Discuss the relative merits of stimulation and equalization as princi- 
ples governing the distribution of the burden of school support. 
Upon which would you put the greater emphasis? Which, if cither, 
would you eliminate? 
5. To what extent has the Nation participated, and to what extent does 
it now participate, in school support in your State? 
6. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of making public education 
strictly a national concern, to be supported solely from national 
sources.

    CHAPTER XI 
APPORTIONING THE BENEFITS 
Purpose of this chapter. This chapter is a continuation of 
the discussion begun in Chapter IX and carried forward in 
Chapter X. The first of this group of chapters introduced 
the problem of educational inequalities; the second offered 
one line of procedure for the reduction of these inequalities. 
The procedure there suggested was the use of central as well 
as of local supporting units. In the present chapter a second 
line of procedure will be discussed, which is supplementary 
to the preceding, and directed toward the same general pro- 
blem. 
It has been shown in Chapter X that at least a portion of 
the money required for the support of public education must 
be derived from what are known as central units. The State 
is recognized as one of these necessary units in every modern 
proposal concerning the matter. A limited amount of na- 
tional participation is also usually recommended. Besides 
these units, the county, or some other unit which is inter- 
mediate between the State and the local district, is generally 
recommended. But the money which comes from these 
several central units must be apportioned in some way to the 
districts or other local units; all of it, that is, except what is 
expended directly by the central units themselves. The pro- 
blem of this chapter is to consider what bases and methods 
are now used, and what should be used, in apportioning this 
aid from central units. 
General and special aid. The money contributed by 
central units to the support of education in local communities 
is still spoken of as State and national and county “aid.”
-P-A-G-E-311
APPORTIONING THE BENEFITS 297 
The type form is “State aid.” In most States, and also in 
most plans proposed by students of school finance, this 
State aid is of two kinds — general and special. General 
aid is assigned to public schools, as a rule, for the promotion 
of general public-school work. Special aid is extended for 
the promotion of special activities which would be neglected 
by local communities if left to themselves. The various ob- 
jects for which special aid is granted will be listed at length 
later on in this chapter. Such things as transportation of 
pupils, vocational instruction, and rural high schools may 
be mentioned here as examples. But it is necessary to dis- 
criminate clearly between these kinds of aid at the very 
outset of this chapter, because the methods and bases used 
in apportioning these aids are very different. The early 
sections of this chapter will be concerned with the factors in- 
volved in the distribution of general aid. 
Traditional apportionment of general aid. The most 
widely used basis for the apportionment of general aid to-day 
is the scholastic population basis; that is, the number of 
children in a school district or county who are of a specified 
age. In 1910 this basis was used singly or in combination 
with other bases in twenty-eight States. 
The earliest bases to be adopted by the States for the ap- 
portionment of general aid were the total population basis 
in New York, and the population and wealth bases in Con- 
necticut. The latter State adopted its plan in 1789, and the 
former continued it until 1851. At that time, Connecticut 
used its State funds for the assistance of school societies. 
The scholastic population basis was adopted by this State 
in 1820, and from this source the method spread to almost 
every State. The reaction against the school census basis 
began in Minnesota, in 1875,1 but the plan has continued

to dominate the thinking of legislatures down to the pre- 
sent day, so that it is entitled to the distinction of being 
called the traditional method. 
Defects of the traditional method. A very severe criti- 
cism of the plan of distributing State money to counties, and 
State and county money to districts, on the basis of scholas- 
tic population is found in the report of the School Survey 
Commission of the State of Virginia.!_ This report says: 
The apportionment of school funds on the basis of school pop- 
ulation was formerly the method employed in almost every State. 
It is bad practice, however, and has been abandoned in the most 
progressive States, the principal objections to it being those indi- 
cated below: = 
1. The distribution of funds on the basis of school population is 
grossly unfair because the number of children in the school popula- 
tion has no direct relation to the number of children actually en- 
rolled in the schools or to the amount of education provided... . 
As a matter of actual fact the present method of apportionment 
pays a premium to counties for keeping children out of school, 
since funds are supplied on the basis of school population, but ex- 
pended on the basis of attendance. 
2. Closely related to this is the unfairness which arises from the 
fact that, within certain limits, State and county funds are appor- 
tioned without definite relation to the amount of education pro- 
vided, as measured by the length of the school term. Counties and 
districts having a school term of seven months, for instance, receive 
per child of school age the same amount of State or county aid as 
counties or districts having a school term of nine months.... By 
the present method of apportionment the State pays counties or 
cities, and counties pay districts, a premium for short school terms. 
8. Again unfairness is found in the present method of apportion- 
ment by virtue of the fact that the adequacy of instruction is 
ignored.... The State pays the county and the county pays the 
district a premium for maintaining an inadequate teaching force. 
4, At present the school census is taken once every five years,

  APPORTIONING THE BENEFITS 299 
with the result that gains or losses in population may frequently 
make the latest figures for school population very erroneous. .. . 
5. The present method of apportionment disregards almost en- 
tirely the great differences among counties, cities, and districts in 
their ability to provide for school support out of local funds. The 
wealthiest cities and the poorest counties, all receive alike the same 
relative amount of State aid... . 
6. Finally, it is to be noted that the present method of appor- 
tionment of the State school funds makes no distinction between 
counties, cities, and districts which make little effort to provide 
proper education and those which make every effort to provide 
good ‘schools. ... 
The foregoing statement is comprehensive of the situa- 
tion in nearly every State where the school census basis of 
apportionment is used, except that the fourth point would 
not apply in States which maintain an annual or continuous 
census. There is one important consequence of the use of 
this basis which is omitted from this report, namely, that 
in some States there has appeared a tendency on the part 
of districts or counties to “pad” the reports of their scho- 
lastic populations.? 
A marked discrepancy is sometimes found between the 
school census reports filed with State departments of educa- 
tion and the reports of children of corresponding ages con- 
tained in the federal census. It has also been charged that 
certain communities in the South have diverted to the edu- 
cation of white children money that was apportioned by the 
State for colored children. 
Cubberley’s investigation. The earliest intensive study of 
the bases of school fund apportionment was made by Cub- 
berley.2- This book, while old, is still a classic, although

  300 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
several of its conclusions are now questioned by some author- 
ities. Much of the book is consumed with statistical anal- 
yses of the results of then existing apportionment systems. 
The most serviceable part, and the part that will be sum- 
marized here, is devoted to the evaluation of existing and 
possible systems in theoretical terms. This evaluation 
follows: 
1. Basis of amount of taxes paid. This is “one of the lowest 
and most primitive methods.” It merely perpetuates exist- 
ing inequalities, and is “one of the worst that could be de- 
vised.” 
2. Basis of property valuation. This is described as “a 
slightly better basis”; but “it is the children to be educated 
rather than the possession of wealth by their parents which 
ought to be the important factor in any system of distribu- 
tion.” 
8. Total population basis. While superior to both of the 
preceding, at best this method “‘is only a rough method of 
approximately determining the number of children for whom 
education must be provided.” It falls short in this regard to 
the extent that the proportion of children in the total popu- 
lation differs in different communities or school districts. 
Once rather widely used, this method has been almost com- 
pletely abandoned. 
4. School census basis. This basis, because of the ease of 
its administration and its apparent justice, has become the 
most popular of all. Its disadvantages have already been 
discussed. 
5. School enrollment basis. This was the first great advance 
over the school census basis. Under this plan “each com- 
munity would receive exactly the same amount for every 
pupil enrolled, and nothing whatever for any pupil not en- 
rolled.” The objection is that a pupil who is enrolled for a 
day counts the same as one who has been enrolled for a whole
-P-A-G-E-315
  APPORTIONING THE BENEFITS * 301 
year, The plan thus offers no incentive to districts to keep 
pupils in school. 
6. Average membership basis. ‘Under this basis of appor- 
tionment each community would be paid by the State both 
in proportion to its success in securing a large enrollment and 
in proportion to its success in keeping a Jarge percentage of 
those enrolled in membership in the school during the term. 
... The effect is to put a premium on the efforts which a 
community makes to keep up its enrollment throughout the 
year.” The plan is deficient in that it puts no emphasis upon 
regularity of attendance, and does not encourage reduction 
in the size of large classes. 
7. Average daily attendance basis. Under this plan “the 
important consideration becomes the actual number of 
pupils at school each day.” Regularity of attendance, as 
well as enrollment and retention, are stimulated by it. It is 
defective because it takes no account of length of term; 
twenty pupils attending regularly for one month averaging 
the same as twenty pupils attending regularly for nine 
months. 
8. Aggregate days of attendance basis. Either of two 
methods may be used to determine aggregate daily attend- 
ance. ‘One method is to add up the total number of days 
of attendance for every school and divide the total amount 
to be apportioned by this sum, which will give the number 
of cents per pupil per day, from which the total apportion- 
ment of any district may be determined by multiplying the 
amount per pupil per day by the total (aggregate) number 
of days of attendance in the district. The other method is 
to calculate the average daily attendance for each school . . . 
and then multiply this by the number of days the school was 
_ kept open. The first method is much simpler from the stand- 
point of State bookkeeping.” This method adds to the 
advantages of the average daily attendance basis the further
-P-A-G-E-316
302 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
advantage of allowing for differences in length of term. | It 
is generally regarded as the fairest of the bases which are 
founded upon the number of pupils actually in school. The 
most serious objection to it is that it favors large schools 
over small schools to an extent which the actual cost of the 
two kinds of schools does not warrant. 
9. District basis. This basis would involve the granting 
of a fixed sum to every school district, regardless of the num- 
ber of pupils or teachers. The weakness of such a procedure 
is obvious. 
10. Teacher basis. Here we find a “definite recognition of 
the teacher unit in the making of an apportionment by set- | 
ting aside a definite sum for every teacher employed.” This 
method recognizes the fact that it costs approximately the 
same to provide a teacher, and hence to provide a school, for 
fifteen pupils as for thirty pupils. Also, the method en- 
courages the multiplication of teachers and consequent re- 
duction in size of classes, a thing much to be welcomed in 
most large city school systems. 
Four distinct elements are seen to run through this series — 
of possible bases for the apportionment of general aid. 
These are wealth, population, children, and teachers. Ex- 
cepting population, these same elements will be found at the 
root of most modern theories and methods for the distribu- 
tion of school funds, both general and special. 
Other aspects of Cubberley’s proposals. Before attempt- 
ing to summarize these contemporary theories and practices, 
let us notice two further aspects of Cubberley’s early pro- 
posals. 
One of these aspects has to do with general aid, and is to 
the effect that, ideally, such aid should be apportioned on a 
combination basis which takes account of both effort and 
need. Ofcourse, it is the efforts and needs of local districts 
—the recipients of the aid—that are referred to. In 
  ie 
 
-P-A-G-E-317
  APPORTIONING THE BENEFITS 303 
apportioning its aid to schools, the State or other central 
unit should consider what each local unit has been doing 
for itself, and also what it is able to do for itself. The 
best arrangement for taking cognizance of effort, thinks Cub- 
berley, is to apportion a certain amount of money for each 
teacher employed, and also a certain additional sum for 
every pupil in aggregate daily attendance. Need should be 
recognized by the setting aside of a definite portion of the 
central aid fund, to be distributed only to poor districts in 
proportion to their poverty. 
The second aspect to be observed is the author’s plan for 
providing special-aid funds for stimulating local communi- 
ties to develop along necessary lines which, while of recog- 
nized importance, are likely to be neglected otherwise. The 
policy of special aid is recommended for high schools, and for 
“kindergartens, manual training, physical training, evening 
schools, small schools for special classes, parental schools, 
and vacation schools.” The policy is desirable only in the 
initial stages of a new and costly educational development. 
Ultimately, the objects of special aid ought to be absorbed 
into the regular educational system, and receive their sup- 
port in the regular way. The use of special aid in the en- 
couragement of high schools is a good example of its tempo- 
rary character. Cubberley outlines five stages in the high- 
school movement from the financial standpoint. 
(1) The “permissive” stage, when local cities, towns, and 
districts were permitted to vote local high schools to be sup- 
ported entirely from local funds. 
(2) The “county” stage, found only in a few States, where 
the taxing area for high-school purposes is enlarged to in- 
clude an entire county. A county high school results. 
(3) The “special subsidy” stage, where special State-aid 
grants are made to special schools. 
(4) The “general subsidy” stage, where State aid is
-P-A-G-E-318
  304 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
granted to all high schools meeting stipulated requirements, 
and a special tax is levied for the purpose. 
(5) The stage of “complete absorption,” in which high 
schools are recognized as integral parts of the public school 
system, and made the beneficiaries of general aid. 
The general aspects of the plan for apportioning State aid 
which seem to find most favor in Cubberley’s mind in this 
study may be summarized as follows: The State should set 
up two separate major funds, (1) for general and (2) for 
special aid. The general aid fund should likewise be divided 
into two main parts; one part to be distributed as a reward 
for effort, and the other part as a recognition of peculiar 
localneed. The “effort” fund should be apportioned on the 
bases of teachers employed and children in aggregate daily 
attendance. The “‘need” fund should go only to poor dis- 
tricts, and should be proportioned to their poverty. This 
analysis accounts for the first major fund — for general aid. 
The second major fund — for special aid — should be divided 
into as many separate funds, in principle, as there are special 
educational activities to stimulate. Each of these special 
aid funds should then be distributed in a way designed to 
further the special object of the fund. 
Cubberley’s “Osceola” plan. A second plan, in which 
the procedure is more definitely indicated, and which in- 
volves the application of somewhat different principles, was 
proposed by Cubberley in 1914 in his model school code for 
the imaginary State of Osceola. Both State and county 
aid are provided for in this plan. The State aid is derived 
from two sources; (1) from the invested State school fund, 
and (2) from a State school tax levied as a prior lien on cor- 
poration taxes. The county aid comes from a county school 
tax, levied on the regular assessment rolls of the respective 
counties. The amount of the State school tax and of the 
county school tax shall each suffice to provide twenty dollars

for each pupil in average daily attendance in the schools the 
previous year. As to apportionment, this is to be accom- 
plished after the following fashion: 
The income from the State invested school fund is to be 
used solely for equalizing educational advantages in the 
several counties. 
The income from the State school tax, and the income 
from the county school tax, shall each be apportioned in the 
following detailed way:! 
I. Teacher grants. To be paid on the basis of actual employment, 
as certified to the State department of education by each county 
board of education. ... What constitutes full-time and half-time 
teachers shall be determined, by general rule, by the State board of 
education. 
(1) For each county or city superintendent of education em- 
ployed within the county, one third of the salary paid such, up 
to a maximum State (or county) grant of $1200. 
(2) For each county or city school health officer, devoting full 
time to the work of health supervision in the schools, and each full- 
time county or city attendance-officer, one third of the salary paid, 
up to a maximum State (or county) grant of $1200. 
(8) For each assistant superintendent in either city or county, 
and each supervising principal who has his full time free for the 
supervision of instruction, one third of the salary paid such up to a 
maximum State (or county) grant of $600. 
(4) For each full-time supervisor of a special subject of instruc- 
tion, whose work is primarily to teach and guide teachers; each 
supervisor of playgrounds; and each superintendent of school at- 
tendance, $400. 
(5) For each full-time nurse employed, $300. 
(6) For each full-time teacher employed in elementary schools, 
including kindergarten teachers, teachers of special subjects or 
classes, or teachers in special types of schools, and school-play- 
ground directors, $250.

(7) For each full-time teacher employed in regularly organized 
intermediate schools, or vocational schools of intermediate grade, 
$275. 
(8) For each full-time teacher employed in a secondary school, 
$300. 
(9) For each full-time evening-school teacher employed; each 
full-time teacher employed for half a year; and each half-time 
teacher employed; — one half of the above grants. 
(10) For each vacation-school teacher, and each vacation-play- 
ground assistant employed, for each week of employment, $8. 
IL. Extra school grants. To be paid for the maintenance of each 
school which complies with the requirements for approval of such 
grants, as fixed by general rule by the State board of education. 
(1) For each year of secondary-school instruction, not less than 
two nor more than six in number, and meeting the conditions for 
approval of such grants, $100 extra for each year of instruction so 
maintained, in each secondary school. 
(2) For each course, of not less than two years in length and 
meeting State conditions for approval, maintained in industrial 
work, household economics, or agriculture, in addition to other 
courses of instruction 
(a) In an intermediate school, $100. 
(b) In a secondary school, $125. 
(But one course to be approved for grants in each of the three 
groups of subjects.) 
(3) For each properly equipped county school of agriculture, 
industrial work, and household economics, of secondary-school 
grade, and providing approved instruction in these subjects, and 
not to exceed one grant to a county for such a school, $500 for each 
year of instruction maintained, not less than two nor more than 
four in number. This grant is to be in lieu of any extra school grant, 
under the provisions of this subdivision. 
(4) For each city industrial or trade school maintained, and 
providing improved instruction preparatory for the industries, 
vocations, or trades, $400 for each year of instruction maintained, 
not less than two nor more than four in number. This grant is to 
be in lieu of any extra school grant, under the provisions of this sub- 
division. 
(5) For maintaining an approved course for the training of 
teachers for the rural schools of the county, in connection with a 
four-year secondary-school course in a county school of agriculture,

industrial work, and household economics, and given in the fourth, 
third and fourth, or graduate year of such a course, an additional 
grant of $500. 
(6) For each approved city normal school maintained in a city 
school district of the first class... a grant of $1000. 
(7) For each parental-home school maintained by a city, county, 
or city and county school district combined, an extra grant of $800. 
III. Library and book grants. To be paid to counties and cities 
maintaining free public libraries, under the supervision of the edu- 
cational department, and under conditions to be prescribed by the 
State board of education. 
(1) To each city maintaining a free circulating city library and to 
each county maintaining a free circulating county library, a grant 
of one third of the cost of maintenance up to a maximum State 
grant of $1200. 
(2) For each branch county library maintained, with a full-time 
librarian in charge, $250. 
(8) For aid in the purchase of free textbooks, supplemental books, 
and school-reference libraries, a grant of, for each classroom teacher 
employed: 
$20 for each elementary-school teacher; 
$25 for each intermediate-school teacher; and 
$30 for each secondary-school teacher. 
Evening school and part-time classroom teachers to be counted 
as fractional teachers for the time employed. 
IV. Consolidated school grants. For each consolidated school 
maintained an extra and additional grant of $150 for each teacher 
employed therein, not less than three nor more than six in number. 
V. Attendance grants. The remainder of the State school tax, 
after the above specific grants have been set aside, and after the 
building subsidy (elsewhere directed) shall have been set aside, shall 
be apportioned, to the different counties in this State in proportion 
to the number of pupils who have been in average daily attendance 
in the public schools of each during the preceding year. 
This plan has been quoted in some detail, first, because it 
cannot be adequately expressed in briefer space, and, second, 
because of its importance. It represents the matured view 
of a widely recognized authority; and it parallels a definite 
tendency in the legislative enactments of several States.

Recent school code revisions in California and Massachu- 
setts, described below, are along lines very similar to those 
appearing in this Utopian scheme. ; 
Three features of this plan seem to deserve special recog- 
nition. One of these is the apportionment of central aid in 
terms of fixed sums per teacher, school, etc., rather than in 
proportions of total expenditures. Another is the paramount 
importance of special aid; general aid appearing only in the 
attendance grants and in the apportionment of the income 
from State invested funds. The third is the great number 
of objects for which special aid is granted. These include 
superintendents, health officers, assistant superintendents 
and supervising principals, supervisors of special subjects, 
school nurses, elementary, intermediate, and secondary 
school teachers, vacation school teachers and playground 
directors, general instruction in high schools, vocational in- 
struction in intermediate and high schools, city vocational 
high schools, county vocational high schools, rural-teacher 
training courses, city normal schools, parental-home schools, 
libraries, free textbooks and reference books, and school 
consolidation. A fourth feature is discussed in the next. 
section. 
Equalization and stimulation. In Chapter X, the justi- 
fication for the employment of central units of school sup- 
port was found in the principles of equalization and stimu- 
lation. It is necessary to stimulate local units to larger 
effort by rewarding such effort when made; and it is neces- 
sary to draw upon some central source in order to equalize: 
the differences in ability found among local units. Tt will 
now be useful to observe the applications of these principles 
in the two general methods for distributing central aid that 
have been described. 
In Cubberley’s first plan, the general aid fund is divided 
into two parts. One of these parts is distributed on the, 
 
-P-A-G-E-323
APPORTIONING THE BENEFITS 309 
basis of teachers employed and number of children kept in 
average attendance at school. This distribution basis is a 
clear recognition of the effort put forth by-each local com- 
munity, although it recognizes only two types of effort. The 
second part of the fund is distributed to local districts in pro- 
portion to their demonstrated needs, and is intended to go 
only to the poorer districts. By this means the ability of the 
poor district is raised toward the level of that of the wealthier 
district; in other words, we have here an example of equali- 
zation. 
In the “Osceola” plan, emphasis seems at first sight to be 
placed upon the principle of stimulation, since so large a part 
of the central aid funds is used to reward special educational 
achievements. But closer consideration will make it clear 
that the principle of equalization receives as great if not 
greater emphasis. Ostensibly, only the income from the 
State’s invested funds is distributed according to evidence 
of need. However, as we have already noted, under this 
plan the bulk of the burden of school support is borne by 
central units. Salaries are assumed, one third by the coun- 
ties, and another third by the State; and a large share of the 
other costs are also assumed by the State and county... The 
burden resting upon local districts is therefore correspond- 
ingly slight; so that it follows necessarily that differences in 
the abilities of these local units will have comparatively 
little effect upon the educational offerings provided. The 
plan, therefore, really operates at least as favorably from the 
standpoint of equalization as from that of stimulation. 
Early State survey recommendations. A review of the 
recommendations made by the various State school survey 
commissions shows the influence of the theories that have 
just been described upon the practical reforms that have 
been contemplated in State legislation. A similar review, 
in.a later section, of actual legislative tendencies, will show
-P-A-G-E-324
  310 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
this influence in terms of reforms actually accomplished. 
At this point let us notice a few examples of survey re- 
commendations appearing before 1920. 
One of the earliest State surveys in which mention is made 
of the problem of apportionment is that of Vermont. This 
survey was published in 1914. It recommends that the 
State (the county not being a participating unit in Vermont) 
should pay for supervision, teacher-training, medical in- 
spection, transportation of children, teachers’ salaries in 
part, and the “general means of education, such as educa- 
tional meetings, summer schools, reports, statistics, courses 
of study, bulletins, circulars, and manuals.”’ It should also 
bear “such portion of the expenses of the school system as 
will enable the several towns to have schools that will, as_ 
nearly as possible, be uniform in quality, character and ex- 
pense.” !_ The emphasis in these recommendations seems 
to be placed upon the principle of aid, but there is distinct 
recognition of the principle of equalization in the last pro- 
vision. 
Two years later the Wyoming Survey Commission sug- 
gested that State school funds “‘be apportioned to the coun- 
ties, one half in proportion to the number of teachers em- 
ployed, and one half on the aggregate daily attendance”; 
and that county funds to the amount of $500 per teacher be 
apportioned “in proportion to the number of approved teach- 
ers employed.” 2 
The Delaware Commission, appointed by the General 
Education Board, says: * 
State funds for elementary schools should be apportioned to the

  APPORTIONING THE BENEFITS 311 
several local school units on a double basis — the basis, first, of the 
number of children of elementary school age enrolled; and the basis, 
second, of school attendance. ... State aid to high schools should 
be granted on the basis of cost of maintaining high schools of a given 
grade and rank. 
The recommendations of the Maryland Commission, also 
appointed by the General Education Board, are the same in 
principle as those of the Delaware Commission.* 
The Colorado Survey Commission, in 1917, offered an un- 
usually good criticism of the traditional plan for distributing 
State and county funds. It followed this with the recom- 
mendation that both of these funds should be distributed on 
the basis “‘of the number of teachers employed and the ag- 
gregate attendance.” 2 The Arizona Survey, appearing the 
same year, fecommended the apportionment of State aid to 
counties on the basis of “approximately $200 for every 
teacher employed in public elementary and secondary 
schools,” and suggested that any remaining money should 
preferably be used to equalize educational opportunities in 
all of the schools of the county.’ 
The South Dakota Commission, in 1918, recommended 
the adoption of a new basis for the distribution of the present 
State permanent fund and future State school taxes, as fol- 
lows: 4 
(a) The permanent fund to be distributed on the basis of aggre- 
gate daily attendance and the number of teachers employed . . . pro- 
vided that weak schools in sparsely settled sections of the State be 
credited with not to exceed 2000 attendance days in addition to

their actual aggregate daily attendance; (b) the proposed State 
taxes to be awarded for the consolidation of schools, establishment 
of rural and other high schools, teacher training in high schools, etc., 
only when the local school communities have indicated their 
codperation by agreeing to certain requirements made by law, as a 
stipulation under which such aid may be received. 
Two important State surveys appeared in 1919. These 
were for the States of Virginia and Alabama. ‘The first was 
made by an independent commission; the second by the 
National Bureau of Education. The Virginia Commission’s 
critique of existing methods of apportioning central aid 
funds has already been quoted. It proposes to modify 
these methods by distributing part of the funds “on the 
basis of aggregate number of days attended by pupils and of 
the number of teachers employed,” and by distributing an- 
other portion for equalization purposes, at the same time 
recognizing “to some degree the extent to which reasonable 
local support is provided.” !_ The Alabama Commission 
also expresses its dissatisfaction with existing methods of 
distributing State funds, and recommends: 2 
They should be used (1) for all the children attending school; (2) 
as an award for good work well done; and (3) for the schools that 
need help the most. 
The survey committee is convinced that these ends can be best 
served if not to exceed one half of the State funds were apportioned 
on the aggregate attendance of school children in each school in the 
county, and the total number of teachers employed; and the balance 
of the fund were entrusted to the State department of education 
...for apportionment to the schools of the State as rewards for 
good work, and as direct help for needy, struggling communities. 
This would be both democratié and just.

APPORTIONING THE BENEFITS 313 
foregoing reports may be arranged in two groups. Vermont, 
Delaware, and Maryland planned for a two-unit system of 
support, by State and district, the county not being utilized 
in those States. Wyoming, Colorado, South Dakota, Vir- 
ginia, and Alabama planned for a three-unit system — 
State, county, and district. The Vermont plan was drafted 
before the theory of apportionment had been thoroughly 
developed; which accounts, perhaps, for its vague and 
involved character. The Delaware and Maryland plans 
emphasize the per-pupil bases of apportionment, and are 
designed to encourage both enrollment and attendance. On 
the high-school level, communities are encouraged to pro- 
vide secondary education of standard quantity and type. 
Both of these surveys appear to put their greatest stress on 
the principle of stimulation. 
The surveys proposing a three-unit plan, except Virginia, 
were directed by the National Bureau of Education. While 
several variants appear in the recommendations of these 
surveys, the aggregate-attendance basis and the number-of- 
teachers-employed basis are found in nearly all of them. 
The first of these bases is a recognition of the stimulation 
principle; the second recognizes both equalization and stimu- 
lation. South Dakota and Alabama also provide additional 
funds for the promotion of special educational efforts, and 
the Virginia survey proposes a special State equalization 
fund. In general in these surveys, both State and county 
aid funds are distributed on similar bases. In some in- 
stances State aid is distributed directly to the counties, and 
then, after being added to the county aid, is apportioned by 
the counties to the local districts. In other cases both State 
and county aid are distributed directly to the districts. 
The Arkansas and Oklahoma surveys. ‘The reports of 
the school surveys in Arkansas and Oklahoma, which were 
conducted by the United States Bureau of Education, were 
   
-P-A-G-E-328
  314 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
published in 1923. They are the most recent of the Bureau’s 
State-wide surveys, and represent a departure from its pre- 
vious policies in that they both recommend a two-unit in-, 
stead of a three-unit system of support. The abolition of 
local school districts is urged, thus making the county or city 
the unit, with the confining of all school support to the 
State and the counties, except for the present nominal 
amount of national participation. This agrees with Cubber- 
ley’s “Osceola” plan. The problem of distribution, there- 
fore, concerns mainly the apportionment of State aid to the 
counties. However, the details of the apportionment plan 
are not completely worked out. With respect to State aid, 
the Oklahoma Report recommends the adoption of “‘mod- 
ernized, scientific methods which will recognize variations 
among the local school units as to length of school year, as- 
sessed valuation per child in average daily attendance, local 
tax rate, aggregate days of attendance, number and qualifica- 
tions of school officers and teachers employed.” The county 
school tax, of not less than ten mills, should be distributed 
among the schools of the county on a per-teacher basis.* 
The Arkansas Survey follows similar lines, but specifies 
State funds to cover “salaries of superintendents, principals, 
teachers, truant officers, county superintendents, assistants, 
three hundred rural supervisors, and all members of the staff 
of the State board of education”; to “‘encourage consolida- 
tion, transportation, and the employment of teachers, super- 
intendents, and other school officers, of qualifications higher 
than the lawful minimum”; and to provide for the equaliza- 
tion of opportunity in counties where the school tax rate of 
fifteen mills is insufficient. to provide proper facilities and 
meet minimum requirements.?

The equalization principle apparently predominates over 
the stimulation principle in these survey reports. In fact, 
support by local communities is not only not stimulated, but 
is definitely abandoned. As the Report recommends the 
abolition of the school districts and the substitution of the 
county unit, this is of little importance, as the county then 
becomes the local community. The only other local com- 
munities would be such independently organized towns and 
cities as may exist. A certain element of stimulation appears 
to be contemplated in the distribution of State aid to coun- 
ties, but the details are not clearly set forth; and even here 
the equalization principle clearly takes precedence, since it 
is advised that the State should bear “the major portion of 
the burden of school support.” 
The Updegraff plan. We have referred in the previous 
chapter to the New York and Pennsylvania Surveys, which 
were published in 1922. The financial sections of these sur- 
veys were prepared by Harlan Updegraff. Like Swift in the 
Arkansas and Oklahoma Surveys, Updegraff recommends 
for New York and Pennsylvania a two-unit plan, but the 
units in this case are the States and the local districts. This 
plan, therefore, in distinction to Swift’s plan, proposes to 
retain the common school district as a unit of school support. 
Due to the tenacious hold of the district system on the rural 
population of New York, this seemed a necessity. The pro- 
portionate burden to be borne by the districts varies accord- 
ing to their wealth, State aid being distributed upon the 
basis of combined effort and ability. The principles fol- 
lowed in the apportionment of State, general, and special 
aid are set forth in the Pennsylvania Survey, in the following 
terms: ! 
1. Equalization of ability. State aid should be distriluted in 
1 A Survey of the Fiscal Policies of the State of Pennsylvania in the Field 
of Education (1922), pp. 44-45.  
-P-A-G-E-330
  316 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
such a way as to insure a good school to every community, upon 
a reasonable tax rate.... 
2. Reward for effort. It ought also to stimulate every school 
district to have better schools. .. . 
3. Special aid. It ought also to reward any school that takes a 
new and approved step in an efficient manner. .. . 
4. Equality of opportunity....In applying this principle to 
schools, it means that all forms of aid should be utilized in such a 
manner as to guarantee for each child that education which will 
best fit him for life, irrespective of the particular community in 
which he may happen to live. 
5. Self-determination of action. State aid should be‘“distributed 
also in such a way as to promote the efficient participation of 
citizens in the exercise of citizenship. The converse of this propo- 
sition is that it should not be so administered as to promote bureau- 
cratic control in either State, county, or local education offices. . . . 
6. All districts encouraged. If a system of State aid is work- 
ing properly, not only are the most advanced districts encouraged 
and thus the entire body kept moving, but also those districts 
which are lagging behind are constantly stimulated to come up 
to the standards that have already been adopted through the 
experience of the most progressive. 
Distinguishing features of the Updegraff plan. At least 
two distinguishing features mark the Updegraff plan as com- 
pared with every other plan of apportionment that has been 
described in this chapter. The first of these features is the 
combination of ability and effort into a single apportionment 
basis. The ability of each district is estimated in terms of 
“true valuation per teacher,” and each district’s effort is 
measured in terms of its tax rate. The feasibility of the 
plan, therefore, depends upon some system of equalizing 
taxation values over the State. 
The second distinguishing feature of the plan is the or- 
ganized and detailed way in which it is presented. Table 
XX is a duplicate of the table appearing in the Pennsylvania 
Survey Report, which is intended as a guide to all local dis- 
tricts in determining their entire burden and to the State

department in determining the general aid that is to be 
apportioned to each district. Updegraff himself describes 
the operation of his plan in the following words: 
It will be noticed that every district having a valuation of less 
than $185,000 per teacher can support schools costing $1110 per 
teacher on a.6-mill tax, the amount of State aid in each district 
being the difference between the proceeds of a 6-mill tax in such 
districts and $1110. Similarly, all other districts having a valuation 
of less than $185,000 per teacher may have a school costing $1295 
per teacher with a levy of a 7-mill tax, or a school costing $1480 per 
teacher with a levy of an 8-mill tax. According to this plan, there- 
fore, all districts with the same standards as to what constitutes a 
good school, having a valuation of less than $185,000 per teacher, 
are by this scheme of complementary State aid placed upon an 
equal footing, viz., the financial position in which the $185,000 
district is placed... . 
The question naturally arises why the valuation of $185,000 per 
teacher was chosen as the equalization point. It has been esti- 
mated by carefully extended inquiry that the true valuation of 
property taxable for schools in Pennsylvania, according to the data 
from the secretaries of the boards of education, was, in the year 
1921, $8,318,130,000. ‘The number of teachers in the State for the 
same year was 45,485. The first figure divided by the second gives 
the quotient $185,031 as the true valuation per teacher. Thus, the 
effect of the plan is to place all schools representing valuations 
below the average on the same plane as the school at the average 
valuation, $185,000. This may then be called the Standard True 
Valuation per teacher. 
... There is another feature of this table which is of particular 
importance because it furnishes a method for a short, simple 
computation of the amount of aid that a district will receive. It 
will be noticed that the amount of State aid given in any column 
(for any valuation in Table XX) is always the same proportion of 
the total expense given at the head of the column. Thus, any dis- 
trict with a valuation per teacher of $50,000 will receive from the 
State twenty-seven per cent of its total expenses for each teacher, 
no matter which column is taken or which tax rate is levied. 
Updegraff also presents in his report a rough draft of the 
essential provisions for a statute designed to embody his
-P-A-G-E-333
APPORTIONING THE BENEFITS 319 
  plan. The following sentences are a revised form of this 
draft made by Updegraff, subsequent to its publication. 
Section 1. The terms used in this act shall be understood as 
having the meanings hereby given them as follows: 
(a) The State Standard True Valuation per teacher shall be the 
total true valuation of property taxable for schools in all of the 
school districts of the State for the year preceding divided by 
the total number of teachers in all the public schools of the 
State. ... 
(b) The true valuation per teacher of any district shall be the 
true valuation for that district divided by the number of full-time 
teachers employed for the preceding year, including principals, 
supervisors, and superintendents, but excluding principals and 
teachers receiving national grants under the Smith-Hughes Act. . . . 
(c) The deficiency percentage of any district shall be such pro- 
portion of 100 per cent as the standard true valuation is contained 
times into the difference between the State standard true valuation 
and the true valuation of the district. 
Section 2. Any school district in the State having an equalized 
valuation per teacher less than the State Standard Equalized 
Valuation per teacher shall receive from the State such a proportion 
of its total local expenses for the preceding year (or of its expenses 
for teachers’ salaries) as is indicated by its deficiency percentage, 
provided the minimum and maximum standards prescribed by law 
relative to schools are observed. 
The plan just described is designed to care justly and ad- 
equately for differences among districts in both effort and 
ability. Differences in ability are recognized in the constant 
decrease of aid as one goes up the scale of equalized district 
valuations. Differences in effort are recognized in the in- 
creased amount of State aid granted for every increase in tax 
rate. Other special methods of recognizing effort which are 
advised in the report are: 
(1) Do not give full aid to schools with an average daily attend- 
ance under 12. 
(2) Do not increase aid in recognition of increase of tax rate be- 
yond 8 mills.
-P-A-G-E-334

(3) Reduce the appropriations by gradual amounts for the em- 
ployment of teachers with inferior qualifications. 
(4) Take account in the apportionments of the tendencies of 
local schools to vary greatly from the standard budget dis- 
tributions. 
(5) Reduce the appropriations of schools which have accumu- 
lated a balance of funds from the previous year. 
It is impracticable in this summary to describe other mod- 
ifications of the fundamental plan which were found neces- 
sary in order to adapt it to conditions existing in New York. 
Only the fundamentals are important to us here. 
The details so far outlined have to do with general aid 
alone. Several special aid funds are also recommended, for 
encouragement of physical training and vocational educa- 
tion, purchase of books and apparatus, development of high 
schools, erection of schoolhouses and teacherages, improve- 
ment of buildings, purchase of trucks and wagons, trans- 
portation of pupils, employment of trained teachers in rural 
schools, provision of facilities and officers for supervision, 
and abandonment of one-teacher school buildings. ! 
The new California plan. Up to this point our discussion 
has been mainly theoretical. We have observed the faults 
inherent in thesplan of apportionment based upon scholastic 
population, but the substitute plans thus far described have 
been in the main a priori proposals rather than demonstrated 
facts. It will, therefore, be both useful and interesting to 
observe some actual legislative developments in a few of the _ 
more progressive States. California and Massachusetts, in 
which modernized plans for school support and the distribu- 
tion of aid have been recently instituted, have been selected 
for this purpose. 
In the last few years California has come to rank very high 
among the several States in the matter of financial support

for public schools. It has attracted much attention from 
both the general public and leaders in educational develop- 
ment. The fact, as Swift says, that educational policies 
there “have been molded to no small degree by scientifically 
trained educators” is no doubt largely to be credited for the 
State’s enviable position. 
A three-unit system — State, county, and district — 
nominally prevails in California, although district partici- 
pation, being optional, is uncertain and irregular. A con- 
stitutional amendment requires that the State provide funds 
to the amount of $30 per child in average daily attendance 
in both elementary and high schools.1_ This money is pro- 
vided for from the State tax on public-utility corporations, 
which are freed from the burden of all local taxation. Simi- 
larly, each county is required to levy a school tax sufficient to 
provide $30 per unit of average daily attendance in elemen- 
tary school, and $60 per unit of attendance in high schools. 
If the funds provided by State and county be totaled, there- 
fore, we have a minimum provision of $60 per pupil in the 
elementary schools and $90 per pupil in the high schools, 
without the local districts having contributed one cent to 
public-school maintenance. 
Local support, as stated above, is optional so far as current 
expenditure is concerned, but all outlays for buildings and 
equipment must be made by the local district. All of the 
State apportionment, and sixty per cent of the county ap- 
portionment, must be used for teachers’ salaries; all of the 
district funds and forty per cent of the county funds may be 
used for other purposes. Kindergarten support is provided 
by the local district. 
California distributes her State elementary-school fund,

and likewise her county elementary-school fund, each 
amounting to $30 per child in average daily attendance, upon 
a per-teacher basis. The State provides $700, and the 
county another $700, for every full-time teacher in the ele- 
mentary schools. The remainder of each fund, if such exists, 
is to be apportioned on the average daily attendance basis. 
The State high-school funds, also amounting to thirty 
dollars per child in average attendance, are apportioned in 
this manner: 
a. Day high school. Five hundred and fifty dollars for each of the 
four high-school years maintained. 
b. Evening high school and special day and evening classes. 
Eighty dollars per unit for each of the first ten units of average daily 
attendance. Sixty dollars per unit for each of the second ten units 
of average daily attendance. Forty dollars per unit for each of the 
third ten units of average daily attendance. 
c. Part-time classes. Same as b above. 
d. The remainder, after deducting for a, b, and ¢, is divided by the 
total number of units for average daily attendance and distributed 
pro rata among the districts according to average daily attendance.! 
County aid for high schools, amounting to sixty dollars 
for every attending pupil, is apportioned to the districts as 
follows: 
A. Each high school receives from the county high-school fund 
$250 for each year of the four high-school grades, provided that 
there is at least one teacher for each grade. 
B. Each new school receives $1000. 
C. The county must reimburse any adjoining county for tuition 
and transportation of any pupils from the first county who are 
attending school. 
D. Each evening high school or special day and evening class 
receives $40 for the first ten units, $30 for the second ten units, and 
$20 for the third ten units of average daily attendance. 
E. Part-time classes receive the same compensation as evening 
high-school classes.

  APPORTIONING THE BENEFITS 823 
F. The remainder of the funds are apportioned among the high- 
school districts pro rata on a basis of average daily attendance 
during the preceding year.! 
Another interesting feature of the California plan is the 
effort made to encourage the growth of junior colleges. 
County aid for such schools is only slight at present; but the 
State provides a $2000 annual allotment for each college dis- 
trict, and an additional $100 per unit of average daily attend- 
ance if matched by the district itself. 
In its general features this California plan corresponds 
rather closely to the proposals of Professor Swift in the 
Arkansas and Oklahoma Surveys, which have been noted 
above, and closely follows Cubberley’s “Osceola” plan in the 
matter of support. The three plans utilize central agencies 
of support to a preponderant degree. Each stresses the 
principle of equalization of opportunity almost to the exclu- 
sion of other principles of aid. The efficient operation of the 
plan in California, therefore, gives a certain degree of proof 
that these recommendations are not impractical. 
The Massachusetts plan. Just as Swift’s recommenda- 
tions in the surveys of Arkansas and Oklahoma find their 
practical counterpart in the California system, so the re- 
commendations of Updegraff in the New York and Pennsyl- 
vania Surveys find their practical parallel in Massachusetts. 
Updegraff has himself summarized the Massachusetts pro- 
gram in two brief paragraphs, as follows: ? 
State aid in Massachusetts is divided into two parts: Part I 
provides that either $100, $150, or $200 shall be given for each 
teacher, principal, supervisor, or superintendent in every town or 
city, the amounts varying with professional training or experience. 
These amounts are increased in those towns having assessed valua-

-P-A-G-E-338
  324 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
tions of less than $4500 per pupil based on the net average member 
ship of the day schools. These increased grants range from $500 
per teacher or officer in towns having a valuation per pupil of $400 
but less than $4500 to $350 in those towns that have a valuation 
per pupil of less than $2000. 
Part II makes still further grants to those towns having a valu- 
ation of less than $2,500,000 (without regard to number of teachers), 
which in order to conduct their schools are compelled to levy a tax 
over five mills. The amount paid is based upon the difference 
between the total expenses of the schools (subject to certain de- 
ductions above maximum standards of salaries and expenses per 
teacher) and the amount received from the State under Part I. 
These additional grants range from one-half the difference between 
the expenses and the previous State grant to one-half the difference 
less the proceeds of a 5-mill tax. 
While this plan approximates more closely than any other 
existing plan the principles underlying the Updegraff survey 
proposals, it falls short of those proposals in several ways. 
It is not worked out in the precise detail of the survey plan; 
it does not sufficiently equalize differences in the financial 
abilities of districts; it is complex, and can be applied to any 
given district with difficulty. It is, however, sufficiently 
similar to the survey plans to give ground for a belief in their 
practicability. 
Distributing special aid. The purpose of general aid, it 
has appeared, is to stimulate the growth and equalize the 
burdens and benefits of general public education. The 
purpose of special aid is to “encourage by grants the intro- 
duction of new features into the schools, especially those 
which would not of their own volition be undertaken by 
many communities.” 
The summaries of State school laws published by the Na- 
tional Bureau of Education show that in 1919-20 at least 
nineteen States offered special aid for high schools, fourteen 
for instruction in vocational subjects, seven for teacher- 
training courses in high schools, six for consolidation, four
-P-A-G-E-339
APPORTIONING THE BENEFITS 825 
for rural education, and one for school libraries.!. In the 
account given above of Cubberley’s “Osceola” plan, there 
appeared a number of special-aid provisions, for the en- 
couragement of high schools, of industrial education, of 
teacher training, of parental home schools, libraries and free 
textbooks, consolidation and attendance. A similarly varied 
program is presented in most of the State school survey re- 
ports. Thus, for example, in the New York and Pennsyl- 
vania Reports, Updegraff recommends special aid for high 
schools, for the erection of schoolhouses and teacherages, for 
the abandonment of outworn buildings, for the improvement 
of old buildings, for the purchase of trucks and wagons, for 
transportation, and for teaching and supervision in rural 
schools. 
The methods used for apportioning these special-aid funds 
are almost as varied as the types of aid provided. Some are 
given in the form of lump-sum appropriations, as in the extra 
school grants of Cubberley’s “Osceola” plan. Others are 
apportioned en a per-teacher basis, as the teacher-grants of 
the same plan. Still others, illustrated by the grants for 
erecting schoolhouses, recommended for Osceola, Pennsyl- 
vania, and New York, are apportioned on a basis of percent- 
age of total cost. These three bases are perhaps the most 
frequently employed of any. : 
There are observable two distinct tendencies with refer- 
ence to the relations of special to general aid. In some in- 
stances, educational objects which were at first promoted on 
a special-aid basis have now been incorporated in the general 
public school system and made the beneficiaries of general 
aid. This has happened to kindergartens and to high schools 
in several States. But some States (as, for instance, Califor- 
nia) are maintaining the policy of continued separation,

keeping each new object of aid distinct from all others, new 
and old, to the end that every educational object may be 
supported separately. 
Summary of second major problem. We have now 
reached the end of our discussion of the second major pro- 
blem of this book. This problem, as set forth in the early 
part of Chapter IX, has been to consider the evidences of and 
remedies for our existing educational inequalities, especially 
those of a financial sort. The discussion which is here con- 
cluded has proceeded through three stages. First, the evi- 
dence showing the existence of various inequalities, financial 
and other, was reviewed in Chapter IX. Next, in Chapter 
X, were considered the problems and principles underlying 
the employment of the various units of school support, with 
reference especially to the reduction or removal of inequal- 
ities in educational maintenance. The use of these units to 
stimulate a larger as well as a more equable support was also 
discussed. In the present chapter we have reviewed the 
many problems and procedures connected with the appor- 
tionment of public-school funds from central to more local 
units. 
It will be useful to review at this point very briefly, and in 
a broad and sketchy way, what appear to be the essential 
tendencies revealed by the section of the literature on school 
finance upon which these chapters have been based; and it 
will make for clearness to state in the beginning that this 
section of the literature is at present in an unsettled, not to 
say chaotic, state. If the truth of this statement is not 
already clear, it will possibly become so as we proceed. 
There is no disputing the trend of the evidence adduced in 
Chapter IX. There is too much of it, and it is too well 
authenticated, to be denied. Our American education is 
shot through and through with inequalities of many kinds. 
Unquestionably, in this one great beneficent service which,
-P-A-G-E-341
APPORTIONING THE BENEFITS 327 
  as a Nation, we profess to render to all of our prospective 
citizens, we come about as far as it is possible to come from 
achieving that principle of equality of right and opportunity 
which has been written so eloquently into our political liter- 
ature. Moreover, these educational inequalities do not 
necessarily parallel those natural inequalities among men 
which might offer ground for justifiable exceptions. Educa- 
tional inequalities are distributed geographically, and not 
according to the needs or capabilities of individuals. Also, 
they are attributable in a very large degree to inequalities in 
economic conditions. 
But while Chapter IX thus seems to have performed its 
task rather successfully, in that it has uncovered evidence 
that is conclusive even if disquieting, a similar degree of 
success can hardly be claimed for the chapters that have 
followed it. Here, however, the reason lies in the fact that 
our legislators and our educators have been less successful 
to date in finding an adequate solution for the problem of 
educational inequalities than they have been in proving its 
existence. Several empirical attacks have been made upon 
various angles of the problem, and some of these attempts 
at a solution have shown a demonstrable superiority over 
others, but to a very large degree the solutions which have 
appeared are maintained by political or philosophical argu- 
ments, rather than by objectively determined facts. 
Thus, in Chapter X, we have observed a tendency, among 
educational theorists at any rate, to transfer the burden of 
school support from local to more central units. But what 
should be the extent of this transfer? Should all of the 
burden be shifted in this way, or only a part? Ought the 
local school district, and the county or some similar unit, to 
bear a share? If so, what share? Or should the load be 
placed wholly upon the State, or the Nation, or both? In 
any case, just how big ought the burden to be? While we
-P-A-G-E-342
  328 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
have many opinions and practices in regard to these several 
questions, and while some of these are indubitably better 
than others, yet nothing approaching a scientific solution of 
any of these questions has been reached. 
Again, in Chapter XI, we have discovered a variety of 
plans and procedures for apportioning the funds, provided 
by the more central units, among the local units where most 
of the educational expenditures actually are made. Here 
the problem arises as to whether this apportionment should 
be made solely with a view to securing educational equality, 
or whether the principle of local stimulation, for the purpose 
of securing larger local support, should also be observed. At 
present there is no purely factual answer to this question. 
The answer will depend almost completely upon the prevail- 
ing educational and political philosophy. 
It seems clear, therefore, that in this matter of naming, 
and of adjusting each to each, the units of school support, 
our educators and our legislators have not yet reached the 
conclusion of their labors. Objective, scientific solutions to 
many of the problems are wanting; nor is it now clear just 
how such solutions can be arrived at. On the other hand, 
we must not be too quick to conclude that nothing of value 
has been accomplished. In fact, much real progress has been 
made. While, with respect to many of these problems, we 
are still unable to state with the desired finality just what is 
the best solution, we are nevertheless able to affirm, upon 
the bases of inference and experience, that some of the solu- 
tions are clearly better than others. 
We are able to declare with considerable assurance, for 
example, that too great dependence upon local support is 
responsible for many of our educational inequalities, and con- 
sequently that less dependence upon local units will decrease 
these inequalities. We are also able to say that the county is 
a better taxation unit than the common school district, and
-P-A-G-E-343
APPORTIONING THE BENEFITS 829 
  that a much greater equalization of both the burdens and thé 
opportunities of education would be secured by its more gen- 
eral use. We also know that the traditional scholastic-pop- 
ulation basis which has so long determined the distribution of 
State funds to local units in most of our States is about the 
least desirable basis that could have been devised. We know 
that the effect of this method of apportionment has been to 
stimulate non-attendance, cheap teaching, and local inertia 
in educational activities, where good teaching, full attend- 
ance, and possibly increased local support should in fact be 
stimulated. We also know of methods of apportionment 
which will improve these conditions. It is therefore fair to 
say that very real progress has been made, of an empirical 
sort, in the attack upon this our second major problem, even 
though the procedure has not always been strictly scientific, 
and although the conclusion of the matter is still beyond our 
view. 
TOPICS FOR INVESTIGATION AND DISCUSSION 
1. Is general aid in your State distributed for the purpose of equalizing 
educational opportunities in local communities, or of stimulating 
greater local financial support, or both? Analyze the conditions of 
apportionment to prove your statement. 
2. Make a list of special-aid funds distributed to local supporting units by 
your State. Which of these funds could profitably be eliminated? 
What essential special forms of aid does your State lack? 
8. Upon what bases, and for the achievement of what objectives, is 
special aid distributed in your State? 
4, What criticisms can you make of the methods of apportioning general 
and special aid in your State? 
&, What suggestions can you give for improving the prevailing methods 
of apportionment in your State? What methods, if any, should be 
substituted for those now in use?

CHAPTER XII 
SOURCES OF PUBLIC-SCHOOL REVENUES 
  Purpose of this chapter. In Chapter II there were described, 
as the centers of organization for the discussion presented in 
the remainder of the book, three large problems. Two of 
these problems have been considered up to this point. In 
Chapters III to VIII, inclusive, different aspects of the pro- 
blem of improving the financial management of local school 
systems were discussed. This local problem has thus re- 
ceived the major portion of the space of this book. The 
second or State problem, of determining the essential units of 
support for schools and the manner and extent of their re- 
spective participation, was considered in Chapters IX, X, 
and XI. The third problem therefore remains for considera- 
tion in this chapter. This problem presents itself upon both 
State and local levels, and concerns the sources of school 
revenues, how to make them available, and the nature and 
size of the demand that should be made upon each. 
It follows that in this chapter we shall at times be forced 
to step outside the field of school finance proper and encroach 
more or less upon the domain of general public finance. This 
will occur especially in discussing problems of taxation. 
Here the writer is painfully aware of certain dangers. He is 
conscious of his own lack of that specialized knowledge and 
insight, the possession of which alone would warrant an 
authoritative approach to these deeply involved matters. 
He is also conscious of the futility of attempting to present 
any comprehensive discussion of these problems within the 
limits of a single chapter, even though such limits will be 
ample to contain all that it is fitting for him to say. The 
detailed solution of taxation difficulties must be left to those

who are competent to deal with them. The purpose of this 
chapter will have been served if the reader leaves it with a 
fairly clear notion of what the problems are, of the general 
direction that expert opinion is taking in evolving their 
solution, and with a resolve to become better acquainted 
with the views and labors of real authorities in the field. 
Early revenue sources. In his account of the develop- 
ment of public permanent common school funds, Swift states 
that “‘at least nine sources of school support existed in the 
United States prior to the establishment of general perma- 
nent common school funds.” Prominent among these nine 
sources were gifts and bequests, rate-bills, and lotteries. 
Others were appropriations, license and bank taxes, rents 
and other income from invested funds, and property taxes. 
The last, however, was a relatively unimportant source of 
school revenue during the colonial period. ! 
The sources most commonly resorted to in those early 
days have now been largely abandoned. Few gifts and be- 
quests, comparatively speaking, are now bestowed on public 
schools. The rate-bill — “a form of tuition levied as a tax 
on parents and guardians” — was abandoned in the main 
during the second quarter of the nineteenth century, as a 
result of the struggle for tax support for schools. Another 
source, then almost a favorite, but now outlawed, was the 
lottery. ‘‘Lotteries were a means extensively employed in 
the early decades of the nineteenth century for supporting 
both public and philanthropic institutions. Both colleges 
and public schools derived aid from them.” ? This agency, 
in public as well as private finance, lost its prominence with 
the passage and enforcement of anti-gambling legislation in 
the different States.

From this brief outline of early revenue sources, it is in- 
teresting to turn to the following summary of the sources 
which are functioning to-day. : 
Existing sources. School reventies to-day are grouped 
into three classes, according to their sources. This classi- 
fication has already been observed in our treatment of the 
budget. First, there is the income from permanent invested 
funds, which funds are sometimes spoken of as the “school 
children’s bank account.” Second, there is the income de- 
rived from an assortment of what are known as “incidental 
sources.” These include such things as donations and be- 
quests, tuition, fines and forfeitures, and non-revenue re- 
ceipts from insurance, sale of property, and the like. The 
third and largest portion of the income is derived from the 
last and most fruitful source — taxation. 
The relative importance of these contemporary sources 
was discussed in Chapter I. There it was shown that, taking 
the country as a whole, less than three per cent of the present 
income of the schools comes from permanent funds, about 
five per cent from incidental sources, and the rest from taxes. 
More than nine tenths of the burden of school support is 
borne by taxation. That there is considerable variation 
among the several States in the relative importance of these 
sources is evident from the following quotation: 1 
In only seventeen States is the proportion raised by taxation less 
than ninety per cent. In nine States over one tenth of the school 
revenue comes from school funds and school lands. In two States 
this proportion is over one fifth. In six States the amount coming 
from incidental sources is equal to at least one tenth of the total 
revenue, and in Texas over one fifth of the school money comes from 
incidental sources. 
In the following pages we shall briefly describe the his- 
tory and present condition of these modern revenue sources

—income-bearing investments, taxation, and incidental 
sources — and discuss the possibility of increasing the reve- 
nue obtained from each. 
Permanent school funds, their importance and origin. 
Permanent school endowment funds, based upon federal 
grants of land or money to the States, are found in every one 
of the thirty States that were carved out of the federal do- 
main. The remaining States which have them created their 
endowments for schools out of their own resources. These 
endowments, the income from which was originally expected 
to bear a major part of the burden of public education, now 
bear less than three per cent of that burden, but they have 
nevertheless played an exceedingly important part in the 
history of public-school finance in the United States. More- 
over, it is possible that in the future these funds in many 
States will be largely augmented, and will then become 
again really important bases of school support. Even to- 
day, in some/nine States, more than ten per cent of the 
burden of school maintenance is derived from this source. 
Their past, present, and possible future importance, there- 
fore, justify a rather close examination of these permanent 
funds. 
Public permanent school funds originated variously. 
Doubtless the precedent from which they grew is found in 
the endowments of land, money, and live stock bestowed by 
many colonial towns upon their local schools. Following 
this precedent the colonial central governments began the 
policy of granting lands to the towns for schools, and even of 
reserving for educational purposes lands in towns as yet 
unsettled. ‘‘The permanent school funds in the United 
States owe their origin to the further extension of the policy 
represented by the last type. It was only necessary for the 
States and for the Federal Government, after the formation 
of the Union, to adapt and develop this policy respecting
-P-A-G-E-350
  336 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
their unsettled lands to bring about the creation of the per- 
manent State funds.”! 
Shortly after the formation of the Union, the conflicting 
claims of the different States to the territory lying west of the 
Allegheny Mountains led to the cession of these lands to the 
Federal Government. In 1785, and again in 1787, the 
National Congress passed ordinances for the government of 
this territory which furnished the basis for later grants for 
schools. This policy was confirmed in 1787, in the grant of 
land to the Ohio Company for purposes of settlement, and in 
later grants to other private parties. The same policy, 
applied somewhat differently, was carried over into the con- 
gressional surveys of this unformed territory. It likewise 
prompted the reservation of section sixteen in each township 
for schools when Ohio was admitted to statehood, in 1802. 
This section continued to be reserved for schools in the ad- 
mission of other States, and, after 1848, the reservation was 
extended to include section thirty-six as well. Besides the 
grants described above, which were specifically for schools, 
the States received other grants — salt lands, swamp lands, 
and internal improvement lands — which in many instances 
also were devoted to public education. In.addition to these 
grants of land, the National Government has from time to 
time distributed money among the States. ‘ Particular 
mention should be made of the “per centum” grants of the 
proceeds of the sale of public lands within the States, the 
national bank deposit fund of 1833, and the surplus revenue 
funds of 1837. The use of these moneys for schools was 
optional with the States, but it was so used by several. 
Besides all this, the Federal Government has in at least one 
instance made a direct grant of money to a State for school 
purposes. 
All of the thirteen original States, together with seven of 
1 Swift, F. H.: loc. cit., p. 37.
-P-A-G-E-351
  SOURCES OF SCHOOL REVENUES 337 
the newer ones, failed to participate in the land bonuses of 
the Federal Government. In some instances this lack was 
made up in part by money grants. But in the main these 
States have been forced to build up their permanent school 
funds out of their own resources. For this purpose they 
have made use of State lands, licenses, escheats, fines, be- 
quests, bank stock and bank taxes, war claims, appropria- 
tions, and taxes. 
The “endowment magnificent.” The value represented 
by these various grants, especially of the land grants, is so 
enormous that they have been collectively described by 
Swift as the ‘endowment magnificent.” Following is this 
author’s striking description of the extent of the grants of 
public land.! 
From these various grants there have been bequeathed in all to 
our thirty public-land States approximately 106,000 square miles 
of school lands, 125,000 square miles of swamp lands, and 15,000 
square miles of internal improvement lands and salt lands. . . . The 
domain granted specifically for schools by our National Government 
to its thirty public-land States was nearly as large as Italy, more 
than twice as large as England, more than eight times as large as 
Maryland, and more than twenty-one times as large as Connecticut. 
... The total area of all State and Federal grants... which might 
have been devoted to schools exceeds 325,000 square miles. This 
is a domain large enough to have made an Italy, a France, and al- 
most two Connecticuts. Out of it might have been carved three 
Italys, or six Englands, three Colorados, eight Ohios, or sixty-five 
Connecticuts. 
Present status of the “‘ endowment magnificent.” Speak- 
ing of the expectation of members of early National and 
State legislatures as to the value of this magnificent endow- 
ment for schools, Swift, in the article just quoted, says: ““No 
doubt one or more among them dreamed of a nation armed 
against ignorance and concomitant social disorder by a net- 
1 Swift, F. H., in the American School Board Journal, May, 1921, p. 32.
-P-A-G-E-352
  838 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
work of schools supported by an endowment so vast as to 
make unnecessary any taxation for school support... this 
is certainly what Connecticut expected to realize.” Over 
against these sanguine hopes must be placed a picture of the 
actual status of these funds to-day, as presented by the Na- 
tional Bureau of Education.! 
The total value of permanent school funds in the various States 
is $358,126,268. This amount would be sufficient to run the schools 
of the United States for almost half a year, or eighty days. In other 
words, the child’s available cash amounts to $17.17, and would keep 
him in school for about four months. 
According to the reports received, the total acreage of unsold 
school lands in the United States is 46,314,957. This is an average 
of a little more than two acres for each child enrolled in school. 
The estimated value of these unsold school lands is $489,200,293, or 
an average value of $10.45 per acre. The average value of school 
lands for each child enrolled in school is $23.22. The child’s bank 
account, therefore, amounts to $40.39, consisting of $17.17 bearing 
interest and $23.22 invested in lands, some of which are leased. 
This total wealth, if rendered available, would maintain the schools 
of the United States for a little longer than one year. 
The extent of the discrepancy between early expectation 
and modern realization appears in this final sentence. It 
was expected, at least by enthusiastic legislators, that the 
mere income from this tremendous investment would 
practically suffice in the future to maintain the schools, but 
in reality the entire original investment would be consumed 
to-day in maintaining public education for a single year. 
The annual service then expected of the interest could only 
barely be accomplished by the entire principal; and after that 
one year’s service there would remain, of course, neither 
principal nor interest. The income alone would suffice to 
keep a pupil in school for “one thirtieth of the school year, 
or a little more than five days.” :

  “endowment magnificent” to realize the expectations of its 
creators is not to be charged entirely to the unforeseen ex- 
pansion of public school costs which was described in its 
various phases in our first chapter. This growth of ex- 
penditures is, of course, very considerably responsible, but 
the failure was also due in part to the failure of State author- 
ities to protect this magnificent endowment for their chil- 
dren. “In many States,” says Swift,! “the permanent 
funds and the proceeds which should have been added to 
them have been cared for so carelessly, diverted, squandered, 
wasted, and embezzled so shamefully that what ought to be 
a magnificent endowment, whose income would to-day be 
yielding an appreciable relief from taxation, has dwindled to 
an almost negligible sum, or exists as a permanent State debt 
on which interest is paid out of taxes levied upon the present 
generation.” 
The consequence of this eccicamgeenac is not only that 
much of the original endowment has actually been dissipated, 
but also that much of what still remains is in the form of 
credit funds, or “fictitious permanent school funds.” These 
fictitious or credit funds are of three general types. First are 
those funds “the principal of which has been lost or diverted 
outright, but which is recognized by the State as a perma- 
nent debt on which the State must pay an annual revenue, 
the rate of interest or amount. being fixed by law.” The sec- 
ond type is “‘one concerning which the law provides that the 
State may expend the proceeds belonging to the principal 
as fast as they are paid into the treasury, credit the same to 
the fund, and pay interest on the account thus established.” 
The third class are funds “whose moneys have been bor- 
rowed by the State and which to-day are represented by 
State bonds, which will in all probability never be redeemed, 
and which constitute what is practically a State debt.” 
1 Swift, F. H.: loc. cit., p. 11.  
-P-A-G-E-354
340 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
  Funds of one or more of the foregoing types are prominent 
in sixteen States. They are reported without comment as 
regular permanent school funds, whereas in fact they are 
“nothing save an additional source of taxation.” ! 
Past services of permanent school funds. Because of the 
relatively small part played by these permanent school funds 
in the support of public education, there is danger of our for- 
getting the very important services that have been rendered 
by them in the past. Here, as in almost every aspect of this 
general subject of school funds, Swift’s comments are among 
the best, and deserve to be quoted.? 
From an historical point of view probably no one would attempt 
to question the importance of State permanent school funds. These 
funds not only forced upon the attention of our States the im- 
portance of a public system of education, but they supported State 
school systems during a period of indifference, skepticism, and 
hostility. It is not puttirig the case too strongly to say that our 
State permanent school endowments have been the wheel, ballast, 
and lever to our State systems of free education. They set these 
systems in motion and kept them going. ‘They lifted them to 
higher and higher levels. ‘The permanent public school fund has 
been the lever employed by many a State for raising the standards 
of educational opportunities and facilities; for securing the adop- 
tion of better courses of study; the enforcement of truancy laws; 
providing libraries and apparatus; financing the transportation and 
tuition of pupils. These funds continue to-day to be a source of 
revenue which makes possible the State supervision of schools, and 
which serves as a means by which communication is established 
between every school, however remote, and the State department 
of education. 
The comparatively small per cent of the total public school rev- 
enue derived to-day from permanent school funds is in danger of 
obscuring this present importance. Such funds give a stability, a 
morale, to a State’s system of school support. They serve as a 
perpetual and impressive monument to a people’s belief in free 
and universal education. They symbolize to each succeeding gen-

-P-A-G-E-355
  SOURCES OF SCHOOL REVENUES 341 
eration the interest not only of ancestor and pioneer, but of the 
Nation in education. 
The concluding sentences of this quotation suggest that 
these permanent school funds have not entirely lost their 
value, even though largely superseded by other sources. 
Besides serving as a monument to the educational interest 
of preceding generations, and thus augmenting our own re- 
spect for our public schools, they form in many instances 
the core of the State’s distributive school funds. The con- 
ditioning of the distribution of these latter funds upon the 
meeting by local communities of certain prescribed educa- 
tional standards, as described in Chapter XJ, will enable the 
State to continue to be a strong standardizing agency in 
public education. In order, however, that they may thus 
render their most effective service, and also in order that 
their income may more effectively help to lower the tax bur- 
den, these permanent school funds should be considerably 
increased. The possibilities of increasing them will be con- 
sidered in the following section. 
Future growth of permanent funds. The principal hope 
for any important increase in permanent school funds ap- 
parently lies in the conservation of the school lands yet un- 
sold. The value of these lands at present is estimated at 
around a half-billion of dollars. This in itself is no incon- 
siderable sum, and would yield a noticeable increase in the 
income for schools if it could be converted into an interest- 
bearing investment. However, the longer this land can be 
held before selling it, providing ‘that its fertility or other 
value is preserved unharmed, the better. It will bring more 
upon the market, and consequently will yield a larger perma- 
nent fund. Moreover, the estimate just given of the pre- 
sent value of these unsold lands is probably too low. It is the 
sum of what is known in most States as the “surface” value, 
and hence. ignores the presence of untold mineral wealth.
-P-A-G-E-356
  342 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
“Tn Minnesota, in 1904, the unsold school lands on this 
surface-area basis were estimated as worth $5,354,088.47. 
Since this time an effort has been made to determine the 
value of the ore and timber on these lands, with the result 
that the prospective value of the permanent school fund of 
Minnesota, in 1908, was estimated at $125,000,000.” 1 Not 
all States, to be sure, are as fortunate as Minnesota in this 
respect; but it is undoubted that the great hope for an en- 
largement of the permanent school funds lies in the unde- 
termined mineral and other natural resources lying beneath 
the surface of these unsold lands. This hope can be fulfilled 
only if these resources are discovered in time, and their value 
conserved for public use. 
Another possibility is that of directing the income from 
part or all of what are described further on as “incidental 
sources” into the permanent investments for schools. At 
present this income is used for annual school maintenance. 
But there is ample precedent and considerable argument to 
justify its being saved for the service of coming generations. 
The third possibility carries us forward into the subject of 
new tax legislation, to be discussed at greater length further 
along in this chapter. Among the new taxes which are find- 
ing favor in several States are what are known as “‘sever- 
ance taxes.” These are taxes upon the removal of minerals, 
oil, timber, etc., from the soil. They are taxes upon the re- 
moval of natural resources. These resources have been 
amassed through long periods of time. Once removed, they 
can only be replaced after a long time, if ever. It is mani- 
festly unfair that their benefits should accrue to a single gen- 
eration; especially to an exploiting few. It is therefore urged 
with much reason that their production should be heavily 
taxed, and that the income from these taxes should be

SOURCES OF SCHOOL REVENUES 343 
  set aside as a permanent investment for the service. of on- 
coming generations. The place for this investment which 
is most generally recommended is in the permanent school 
funds. 
Should any State ever earnestly resolve upon augmenting 
its permanent fund for education, there are various means 
readily available for accomplishing that result. Only the 
most conspicuous of these means have been mentioned here. 
While the wisdom of enlarging these funds appears clear to 
many writers, yet it would certainly be unfortunate ever to 
create an endowment so large as to relieve the public of 
bearing the major part of the burden of supporting schools. 
The vitality of the public’s interest in schools and education 
will always be proportional to the effort put forth to sustain 
them. However, in view of the conditions exhibited in the 
course of our first chapter, there need be no fear of any great 
decline of interest from this cause. 
A different view. A very different view of the value of 
these permanent school funds is held by other students of 
school finance. This view is that a large income from in- 
vested funds is likely to be a handicap rather than a help to 
the schools. The reason given is that the income from these 
sources is always far too small to bear alone the burden, or 
any large part of the burden, of public school support, while 
the fact that such an income is known to exist tends to reduce 
the amount derived from legislative appropriations and 
school taxes. Appropriation and taxation officials feel re- 
sponsible for only an undefined portion of school support, 
under the school-fund plan, rather than for the whole. Also, 
the fact that the early expectation that these funds would 
bear most if not all of the burden of school support has not 
been fulfilled, and that they now fall far short of supplying the 
need, has called attention to the enormous growth in recent 
years of public school expenditures. The effect of this has
-P-A-G-E-358
  344 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
been to stimulate dissatisfaction with the present insistent 
demands of the schools, and a reaction against them. 
It is also maintained in defense of this view that the waste- 
fulness and maladministration revealed in the past handling 
of these permanent school funds is inherent in the system it- 
self. Wise, economical, and even strictly honest handling of 
such a fund cannot, as a rule, be expected. To increase 
these funds at this time, therefore, would mean to invite 
further mismanagement and its consequent waste, as well as 
to continue a system which interferes with the securing of 
proper support from appropriation and taxation sources. 
Incidental sources of school revenues. The incidental 
sources of school revenues are so various in character that 
little of general import can be said about them. Approxi- 
mately five per cent of the annual cost of school maintenance 
is thus derived; but, as has been noted, in six States more 
than a tenth, and in one State more than a fifth, of the school 
revenue comes from these sources. In 1917-18 this type of 
revenue totaled nearly thirty-two million dollars. 
The variety of these sources is indicated by the following 
list, compiled from a résumé of the different State school 
laws: Bequests, dog taxes, escheats, proceeds from sale of 
estrays, fees, fines and forfeitures, forest-reserve funds, 
licenses, military-exemption payments, poll taxes, surplus 
road funds. Dog taxes and poll taxes may perhaps be re- 
garded as properly belonging to the next category of sources 
to be discussed — taxation. They have been placed here, 
however, because the first appear infrequently and because 
the second are not a form of property taxation. 
Lacking a better place to mention them, two other types 
of income may here be described. One is the federal aid 
fund for vocational education, often known as the Smith- 
Hughes fund. This money, about two millions of dollars 
annually, is derived from federal sources. The other com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-359
SOURCES OF SCHOOL REVENUES 345 
prises a part of the income accruing from “non-revenue 
receipts.” These receipts “include all moneys derived from 
the sale of bonds, from the negotiation of temporary loans, 
from the sale of school property, or from the proceeds of in- 
surance adjustments.” Money derived from bonds and 
loans must here be excluded, of course, as representing in- 
come from a sort of deferred taxation, but the other income, 
amounting in 1917-18 to about five million dollars, may well 
be regarded as flowing from an “‘incidental” source. 
Some States make more extensive use than do others of 
these incidental sources. This fact suggests an increase in 
the total income from these sources should all States take 
advantage of all their possibilities. However, there is little 
apparent prospect of the schools ever receiving a very large 
income from these sources. On the contrary, enforcement 
of the prohibition amendment may possibly cause a con- 
siderable reduction by cutting off the liquor-license fees. 
Probably the main hope for expansion in this field lies in the 
possible extension of federal aid to the States, along the lines 
described in the preceding chapter. 
Taxation the main reliance. As has been stated before, 
in 1920, about 92 per cent of the total burden of school sup- 
port was borne by State and local taxation. In 1890 this 
proportion was only about 86 per cent. The percentage 
borne by local taxation increased from about 68 in 1890 to 
about 78 in 1920. During the same interval the proportion 
borne by State taxation decreased from 18.4 to 13.8 per cent. 
Similarly, the share of school revenues raised from perma- 
nent endowments decreased during this thirty-year period 
from 5.4 to 2.7 per cent, and that raised from incidental 
sources decreased from 8.3 to 5.3 per cent.! 
In fifteen of the forty-eight States, in 1919-20, more than 
95 per cent of the total school maintenance was derived from 
1U.S. Bureau of Education, Bulletin no, 29 (1922), p. 6.
-P-A-G-E-360
    346 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
taxation. Nine States raised less than 85 per cent in this 
way. Of the school income derived from taxation, two 
States raised more than 50 per cent, and five States more 
than 40 per cent, from State tax sources. On the other hand, 
five States raised less than one per cent, and seventeen 
States less than 10 per cent, in this way. In this last group 
of seventeen States more than 90 per cent of all school taxes 
were raised from local sources.! 
The situation is thus seen to be very different in the differ- 
ent States, but, viewed in a large way, three facts in this 
situation are outstanding. First, it is clear that, of the gen- 
eral sources of revenue here described, taxation bears the 
great bulk of the burden of school support. Second, it ap- 
pears that the proportion of all school revenues derived from 
taxation is increasing. In the third place, the weight of the 
burden is seen to fall increasingly heavily upon local tax 
sources, which already carry more than three quarters of it. 
The battle for tax support for schools. ‘Herbert Spencer, 
in 1850, announced the doctrine that the taxation of one 
man’s property for the purpose of educating another man’s 
children is robbery, and that the State has no more right to 
administer education than it has to administer religion. . . . 
The civilized world to-day has, in the matter of public educa- 
tion, rather followed the dictum of Macaulay that ‘Who- 
ever has the right to hang has the right to educate.’”? In 
these two sentences are summarized the opposing views of 
the parties to a conflict which lasted for a quarter of a cen- 
tury, and which in its outcome established in America the 
unrestricted right of taxation for schools. 
Prior to 1825, schools in the United States were main- 
tained principally through tuition, endowments, and philan- 
thropy, with half-hearted attempts to augment these sources

  by taxation locally applied. As a result, it was a period of 
utterly inadequate educational facilities. To increase the 
difficulty there came, between 1820 and 1830, a sudden in- 
crease in the public demand for better schools. This new 
demand was the product of extended political responsibili- 
ties, growing out of an extension of the suffrage and of the 
rise of a new economic middle class in the population. 
Better education and more of it were demanded for both 
political and social reasons, but more and better schools 
called for other and better than the then accepted bases of 
financial support. Recognition of this fact led to the 
struggle to establish a new basis in public taxation. “By 
1825,” writes Cubberley,! “it may be said to have been 
clearly recognized by thinking men that the only safe re- 
liance for a system of State schools lay in the general and 
direct taxation of all property for their support. .,.The 
battle for direct local, county, and State taxation for educa- 
tion was clearly on by 1825 to 1830 in all the Northern 
States.” 
This battle centered around the passing of school-tax 
legislation by the several States. The legislation developed 
in a succession of waves or stages. The earliest of these 
stages was that of granting permission to local communities 
to organize themselves into taxation districts and to tax the 
property of residents for school purposes, in so far as these 
residents were willing to be taxed. Next came the granting 
to local districts of the power to tax all property for school 
purposes, with or without the consent of the owner. Both 
of these types of legislation may be called “permissive.” 
The third stage appears in the passing of compulsory legis- 
lation, under which local districts were compelled to levy 
taxes for their schools under pain of forfeiting their share

of the State’s apportionment of money. With this stage 
“compulsory local taxation for education had been estab- 
lished, and the great central battle for the creation of a State 
school system had been won.” ! 
Taxation for schools a phase of general taxation. It was 
shown in Chapter I that school expenditures constitute a 
large and integral part of public expenditures in general. It 
is similarly true that taxation for school support is an im- 
portant and integral part of the larger matter of public taxa- 
tion. More money is raised by taxation for schools, on 
State and local levels, than for any other single public pur- 
pose. In many places nearly as much is raised for schools 
as for all other public purposes combined. It follows, then, 
that if a reform in taxation for school support is to be ac- 
complished, it must be worked out in connection with the 
reform, of the whole tax system. Otherwise, the incom- 
petencies and injustices now charged against our taxation 
methods are likely to grow worse instead of better. 
This book does not purport to be a treatise on the general 
subject of taxation. That subject is not a proper one for 
amateur discussion; nor could it be at all adequately com- 
passed in the mere portion of a chapter assigned to it here. 
It is a subject requiring expert attention, by a specialist in 
taxation with plenty of space at his disposal. It is impossible 
to complete this survey of school revenue sources, however, 
and thus to complete the discussion of the main problems of 
school finance, without a sufficient intrusion into this field to 
show its importance to the educator. School people, of all 
people, should be interested and informed in steps looking to 
the improvement of the general taxation system. Moreover, 
if the aid of teachers and other educators could be secured 
and intelligently directed, their assistance should be of con-

siderable service in helping to turn the balance for better 
things. The paragraphs which follow are written merely to 
introduce the problem. If the importance of that problem 
is made apparent to the reader, and if he is persuaded in con- 
sequence to study the work of writers who are really com- 
petent to deal with it, the hopes of the present writer will be 
fully realized. 
The American taxation system. Properly speaking, there 
is no such thing as a general American system of taxation. 
There are as many different systems in vogue in the country 
as there are States. Three taxing units are, however, gener- 
ally recognized. These units are the Nation, the State, and 
the local unit or units. In this account, the interest of which 
is primarily educational, we shall be concerned very little 
with national methods of taxation. That phase of the sub- 
ject will become important only when the amount of national 
participation in school support has vastly increased. 
As has just been said, the systems of State and local taxa- 
tion differ greatly in the different States. Each State has 
worked out its own plan, using to some extent the experiences 
of other States as a guide. Reforms initiated by one State, 
if successful, are also likely to be carried over into other 
States. But while each State is thus a law unto itself, they 
have all utilized in the main most of the following sources: 
the general property tax, the poll tax, business and inherit- 
ance taxes, and the income tax. The last is now found in 
a few States only, but the number is increasing rapidly. 
Among all of these taxes the general property tax — which 
may be defined as “a tax in which the base is the entire 
amount of property, real and personal, owned by the tax- 
payer” — bears by far the greater share of the burden. Of 
the property tax Plehn writes: 
Among all of these sources of revenue the general property tax 
stands preéminent. It is the structural iron which holds the build-  
-P-A-G-E-364
350 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
  ing together. It is the largest single source of revenue and is uni- 
versally regarded as preéminently the taz for all purposes. There is 
no State in the Union in which this tax does not exist, at least as a 
tax for local purposes, although there are six States in which it is 
not used to supply revenue for the State or central government. 
Without a single important exception, it is used in every city, in 
every town or its counterpart in local government, in every district, 
be it a road district, school district, drainage or irrigation district, 
or a district organized for some other purpose.! 
Defects in the American system. Any intensive criticism 
of American taxation systems would have to be directed 
against the plans in use in the various States. There would 
thus be as many criticisms as there are systems. The ma- 
jority of the writers on taxation agree, however, that there 
are two general imperfections which mar the system as a 
whole. One of these is the lack of harmony, amounting at 
times to a lack of comity, in the plans found in the different 
States. The other imperfection is the overemphasis placed 
nearly everywhere upon the general property tax. 
Historically, theoretically, and practically, as a main 
source of public income the general property tax is a failure. 
While it was well suited to the agricultural era in which it 
arose, it is unsuited to the industrial and commercial condi- 
tions that have followed. Theoretically a tax on all pro- 
perty, it is in fact a tax on real property only. There is no 
attainable general property. The intangible element in 
general property, an element which is constantly increasing, 
is usually out of reach of the assessor. The tangible ele- 
ment, chiefly real estate, must therefore bear the burden of 
the tax. 
Practically, says Seligman, “the general property tax as 
actually administered to-day is beyond all peradventure the 
worst tax known in the civilized world.” Plehn writes:

SOURCES OF SCHOOL REVENUES 351 
Everywhere but in America it has been (a) divided into a num- 
ber of subordinate property taxes, (b) allowed to become a subor- 
dinate member of another system, or (c) entirely abandoned. 
Sooner or later it will have to be abandoned in America.+ 
  The general judgment of experts appears to confirm the 
view that the property tax is greatly overworked in the 
American taxation system, and that the system itself lacks 
unity to the extent that it is frequently impossible for one 
State to enforce its tax laws successfully because of lax 
conditions in neighboring States. Most of the reforms pro- 
posed by students of taxation are therefore in the nature of 
supplements to or substitutes for the general property tax. 
Improvements in the administration of the property tax 
itself are also sought by the reformers. 
Proposals of the National Tax Association. It is impos- 
sible to present here all, or even any large number, of the 
various reform proposals that have been made by students 
of the American tax system. But it also seems undesirable 
for us to leave the subject without some indication of the 
direction taken by the thinking of scholars and practical 
reformers. The writer has therefore selected one program of 
reform which has been widely and favorably quoted, and 
which, while relatively brief, is directly to the point of dis- 
cussion. This program was formulated, in 1918-19, by a 
committee of the National Tax Association.? It is an at- 
tempt to draft a model system of State and local taxation. 
Taxation reform on a national scale is not considered in this 
plan, but as the Nation contributes only slightly at present 
to the support of public education this omission is of little 
consequence. Besides its brevity and comprehensiveness 
the plan has the advantage of having been endorsed by what 
is possibly the most scholarly body of taxation experts that

State and Local Taxation.

the country contains. There are other plans, however, and 
many proposals for minor amendments and additions. But 
the plan here presented will introduce the student to the 
problems involved, and will afford a basis for discussion and 
investigation. 
The summary submitted below has been condensed by ' 
much elimination, but is presented in the words of the com- 
mittee except for brief insertions, enclosed in parentheses, 
which will assist in making proper connections. 
Any proposed system of State and local taxation must, at the 
very outset, recognize certain existing conditions and conform to 
certain practical requirements before it can be seriously considered 
as a basis for legislation. These conditions and requirements the 
committee has had constantly in mind. They may be stated 
briefly as follows: 
A. The proposed system must yield the large revenues which our 
State and local governments require at the present time. 
B. It must be practicable from an administrative standpoint; 
that is, it must be capable of being administered by such means and 
agencies as the States have at their command or can reasonably be 
expected to provide. 
C. It must be adapted to a-country with a federal form of govern- 
ment, and to this end must reconcile the diverse claims of our 
several States, which now conflict at many points, thereby produc- 
ing unjust multiplication and disregard of interstate comity. 
D. It must respect existing constitutional limitations, Federal 
and State, or else point to practicable methods of constitutional 
amendment. 
E. It must represent as nearly as possible a general consensus of 
opinion, and to this end must give careful consideration to the most 
influential body of opinion developed and formulated by the 
National Tax Association. 
F. It must not propose measures wholly foreign to American 
experience and contrary to the ideas of the American people. . . . 
Study of the tax laws of the American States reveals the fact that 
there are three fundamental principles which have been more or less 
clearly recognized by our lawmakers. . . . 
The first is the principle that every person having taxable ability 
 
-P-A-G-E-367
  SOURCES OF SCHOOL REVENUES 353 
should pay some sort of a direct personal tax to the government 
under which he is domiciled, and from which he receives the personal 
benefits which that government confers... . 
The second principle is that tangible property, by whomsoever 
owned, should be taxed in the jurisdiction in which it is located, 
because it there receives protection and other governmental benefits 
and services.... 
The third principle, somewhat less clearly and generally ex- 
emplified by our tax laws, but discernible none the less, is that 
business carried on for profit in any locality should be taxed for the 
benefit it receives. 
After this statement of general conditions and principles, 
the committee proceeds to present the following list of State 
and local taxes, with suggestions for their distribution and 
administration. 
1. Personal income tax. The first decision reached by the 
committee was that... there should be a personal tax levied with 
the exclusive view of carrying out the principle that every person 
having taxable ability should pay a direct tax to the government 
under which he is domiciled. [After reviewing several forms that 
this tax might take] the committee...is of the opinion that a 
personal income tax is the best method of enforcing the personal 
obligation of the citizen. . . . It is contrary to the theory of this tax 
that it should apply to the income from any business as such, or 
apply to the income of any property as such. The tax should be 
levied upon persons in respect to their entire net income, and should 
be collected only from persons and at places where they reside... . 
The committee believes that the amount of the income exempted 
from the personal income tax should not exceed $600 for a single 
person and $1200 for a husband and wife, with a further exemption 
of $200 for each dependent up to a number not to exceed three... . 
The lowest rate should be not less than one per cent, and under 
present conditions we regard it as inexpedient to impose a rate 
higher than six per cent. [The committee agrees that the tax should 
be “progressive,” that it should be administered by State officials, 
and that it should be uniform among the several States.] 
2. Property tax. ‘The second part of the tax system proposed by 
the committee is a tax upon tangible property, levied exclusively at 
the place where the property is located. . . . [The committee recom-
-P-A-G-E-368
PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE | 
  mends] that it be confined to tangible property, and that intangible 
property of all descriptions be exempt from taxation as property. . .. 
We believe that the personal income tax which we have already 
recommended will reach income from intangible property fully and 
fairly at the only place where it can be taxed without running the 
risk of unjust double taxation. ... 
The primary work of assessment will, of course, continue to be 
done by local authorities; but it is essential that such work should 
be supervised, and where necessary controlled, by a competent State 
tax commission or tax commissioner. 
3. Business tax. [The committee recommends] a properly con- 
stituted business tax . . . [which] should, except in certain cases, be 
levied on the net income derived from business carried on within the 
State levying the tax. [It is held that] the rate of the business tax 
should be proportional and not progressive. . .. We believe that, in 
general, a tax of two per cent of such income would be inadequate, 
... the rate in no case should exceed five per cent. [The committee 
also holds that] the administration of a business tax must be placed 
in the hands of the State tax commission or tax commissioner, [and 
that] the business tax we recommend is proposed as a substitute for 
all existing business taxes. 
4. Inheritance tax. The committee strongly favors the use of the 
inheritance tax by the American States;...none of our recom- 
mendations, if carried out, will interfere in any way with the levy of 
inheritance taxes by the States. ... 
5. Taxes on consumption. [The committee believes that] the 
National Tax Association will do well to appoint a committee to 
canvass carefully the possibility of supplementing existing sources 
of State and local revenue by taxes levied upon what may fairly be 
classified as luxurious consumption. 
6. Tax administration. Assessment districts shall be large 
enough to justify the employment of at least one permanent official 
in each district, who should receive a salary sufficient to make it 
possible for him to give all his time to his work. Such permanent 
assessors should be provided with well-equipped offices, a suitable 
number of permanent clerks, and such part-time assistants as may 
be needed for a short period each year... .The committee favors 
the method of appointment, since it does not believe that, other 
things being equal, elective officials can or will perform their work 
as efficiently as appointive. . . . [These officials] should serve for a 
term of at least four years, ... [and] all assessors, whether elected 
 
-P-A-G-E-369
SOURCES OF SCHOOL REVENUES 355 
or appointed, should be subject to removal for willful negligence or 
malfeasance while in office. . . . [The committee recommends that] 
@ permanent tax commission, or tax commissioner, should be es- 
tablished in every State, ... [and that] the proposed personal in- 
come and business taxes should be administered by State rather 
than by local authorities. 
7. Separation of sources of State and local revenue. The plan we 
propose does not require any separation whatever of the sources 
of State and local revenue, but... it is not inconsistent with the 
adoption of a thoroughgoing scheme of separation. . . . The com- 
mittee is of the opinion that a partial separation of the sources of 
State and local revenue is desirable, but that complete separation, 
by cutting the connecting cord between State and local govern- 
ments, tends to destroy the State’s sense of responsibility in the 
matter of local taxation. 
With respect to this last topic, the committee’s recom- 
mendations may be summarized thus: income from taxes on 
inheritances and State-wide businesses should be allocated 
to the State; “a State tax on property should be retained 
as a regulator of State finances”; the income from the bulk 
of the property tax*should go to local units; the income 
from the personal income tax should be divided, and a 
part assigned to the State “corresponding to the propor- 
tion which State expenditures bear to the total of State 
and local expenditures”; while the “distribution of the 
proceeds of the proposed business tax may vary from State 
to State.” 
A conservative plan. The slow progress made by tax- 
reform movements in the past is possibly due, first, to the 
tendency of advocates of reform to champion somewhat 
radical proposals, and, second, to the inertia of the average 
voter and the repugnance of the average taxpayer toward 
any tampering with the tax system. Radical reform tend- 
encies have confronted conservatism in its stronghold, and 
the latter has triumphed. 
It is therefore encouraging to observe that the model plan
-P-A-G-E-370
356 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
  submitted by the National Tax Association, and briefly 
quoted above, is one which discountenances all radical 
tendencies. It proposes to make use of existing, or easily 
established, means and agencies; it is adapted to our federal 
form of government; it respects the constitutional limitations 
of State and Nation; it represents the majority opinion pre- 
vailing among conservative reformers; and it is consistent 
with American taxation traditions and experience. These 
conservative features will tend to reassure all those who 
generally regard new tax laws with suspicion. Whether or 
not this particular plan should prove to be the most efficient 
and available for future use, the features here mentioned will 
doubtless mark the plan or plans which succeed in securing 
the support of the American people. 
Variety of sources. Another interesting feature of the 
plan is its emphasis upon a variety of tax sources. It tends 
away from, rather than toward, the ideal of the “single- 
taxers.” It proposes no panacea in taxation. Tangible 
property, business income, personal income, and inherit- 
ances — all are recognized as proper objects of attention on 
the assessor’s list. Expenditures for luxuries are also sug- 
gested as a fifth possible object of taxation. Since this re- 
port was formulated, the “‘severance” tax, on the extraction 
of natural resources, like oil and lumber, has become a fea- 
ture of the tax laws of several States. This is perhaps the 
most important omission from the report. 
The problem, in the use of such a variety of sources, is to 
avoid unjust duplications of the tax burden upon individual 
taxpayers. The committee recognizes this difficulty and 
makes provision against it, but this aspect of the report has 
beert omitted from the summary presented here. 
Equalization of assessments. The plan also provides for 
two sets of assessment officers, one local and the other 
State. The local officers are to have charge of the primary
-P-A-G-E-371
SOURCES OF SCHOOL REVENUES 357 
  work in the assessment of general property. The State tax 
commission or tax commissioner would supervise these local 
property assessments with a view to securing a uniform rate, 
and would also take charge of the administration of the per- 
sonal income and business income taxes. 
One frequent complaint against our existing tax systems 
is that the State general property tax, which is supposed to 
bear equally upon ali of the property in the State, really 
bears very unequally because of the differences in the rates 
of assessment imposed by the local assessors. An equable 
State tax requires both a uniform tax rate and a uniform as- 
sessment rate over the State. An example of varying local 
assessment rates is found in Texas, which has the county 
basis of assessment. Under the law, all property is supposed 
to be assessed for State and county purposes at one hundred 
per cent of its real value. But: ! 
A comparison of the average true value of agricultural land in 
each county, as given by the Thirteenth Census, with the average 
assessed values of lands and buildings, as given in the report of the 
State comptroller for 1911, shows that in only six counties were 
assessed values as much as ninety per cent of true values; in seven 
counties they were between eighty and ninety per cent; in thirteen 
between seventy and eighty per cent; in twenty-seven between 
sixty and seventy per cent; in forty-three between fifty and sixty 
per cent; in sixty-four between forty and fifty per cent; in thirty- 
nine between thirty and forty per cent; in thirty between twenty 
and thirty per cent; and in six they were under twenty per cent. 
These figures are indicative of what may be found in 
several States. It is clear that, so long as State taxes are 
levied upon property which lies within the several counties 
or other local taxation districts, if they are to be equable the 
assessment rates within the several counties or districts 
must be equated. If, however, the plan proposed in the 
next section be adopted, then the equalizing of the assess- 
1 Miller, E. F.: A Financial History of Texas (1916), p. 278.  
-P-A-G-E-372
358 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
ment rates on general property over the State becomes less 
necessary. : 
Separation of sources. The plan here presented does not 
put great emphasis upon the separation of the sources of 
State and local revenues. The committee suggests that 
its plan is not inconsistent with such separation, but rather: 
mildly advises against it. Some authorities, however, regard 
this matter as one of considerable importance. Thus Selig- 
man writes: ! 
What will be gained by the separation of State and local revenues 
is that the State revenues will no longer be collected from the same 
source and in the same manner as the local revenues. It means 
practically that there will be no State tax rate on general property 
added to the local tax rate through the process of apportioning 
State expenditures among the localities according to the assessed 
valuation. It implies as a corollary that some other method of 
securing the State revenues be devised. 
  It is impossible to go into the details of this proposal here, 
but this brief mention will suggest the need for further study 
of the matter by all who are interested in the problems of tax 
reform. Also, it deserves this much attention as a possible 
alternative for the plan of equalizing assessment rates over 
the length and breadth of a State. 
Special school taxes. From what has been said it would 
appear that taxation as a source of school support must be 
studied in connection with the problem of taxation in gen- 
eral; but this does not of necessity mean that school taxes 
should be lumped together with all other taxes for assess- 
ment and collection, in the actual administration of the tax 
system. On this point there are divergent views; one that 
all taxes should be levied and collected in a lump sum and 
then appropriated to various purposes, and the other that

-P-A-G-E-373
‘SOURCES OF SCHOOL REVENUES 359 
  school taxes should be levied, collected, held, and expended 
as a sum apart from other public revenues. The opinion of 
educators seems to favor the latter plan, but there is a dis- 
tinct movement in the other direction. 
We have already noted that seventy-two per cent of all 
public school support in the United States is derived from 
local districts. In some States this proportion is much 
greater than in others. The district is to-day the main re- 
liance of public education. Almost without exception, the 
money contributed by these local districts is raised by a spe- 
cial school tax. In some States this tax is determined by the 
district school board, in others it is voted by the taxpayers 
upon themselves. Still other States utilize both plans, per- 
mitting the district school boards to determine the tax up to 
a certain millage limit, after which authority for a higher 
tax must be granted by vote of the taxpayers. As arule the 
tax determined upon by the district officers or voters is 
assessed and collected by county or township officers, and 
then distributed among the districts for expenditure. Oc- 
casionally it is also expended by the county or township 
officers upon warrant from the district. A minimum tax rate 
is usually imposed if the district would share in the funds 
distributed by the county and the State, and in some States 
a maximum rate, beyond which even the taxpayers them- 
selves cannot go, also is fixed. So long as the district is per- 
mitted to share in the support of schools it is clear that a 
minimum tax rate, or a minimum amount of money to be 
raised per pupil, should be enforced by central authorities, 
but it is difficult to justify the fixation of a maximum 
amount. Why, unless it be to protect an uninterested or 
unprogressive minority from the costs of greater progress, 
should not a community be free to raise as much money as 
it chooses for the support of its own school system? 
Towns, townships, and counties, in certain States, also 
 
-P-A-G-E-374
360 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
  levy special taxes for schools. In Connecticut and Massa- 
chusetts, for example, the levy is made by the towns, in 
Michigan by the township, and by the county (in 1919-20) 
in more than twenty States. The rate of these taxes varies, 
being affected by the assessment rate prevailing in the State, 
and by the extent to which the town or township or county 
is expected to participate in school support. In most 
States it is fixed in terms of mills (per dollar) or cents (per 
hundred dollars), but in California and Wyoming it must be 
sufficient to yield a stipulated sum per teacher, and in Oregon 
and Washington it must yield a stipulated sum per pupil. 
The practice of the last four States accords with the growing 
conviction of educators. 
About half of the States, in 1919-20, collected a special 
tax for schools. In Arizona and Illinois this tax was levied 
at a rate sufficient to raise $750,000 in the first State, and 
$6,000,000 in the second. In Washington the tax was ex- 
pected to yield $10 for every child of school age. In most of 
the other States the rate was fixed in terms of mills or cents, 
ranging from one to five mills according to prevailing rates 
of assessment and the policies regarding the extent of State 
support. Here again, the plan of determining the tax rate 
by the amount needed to procure a stipulated sum per pupil 
or teacher is growing in favor among the students of school 
finance. S 
There seems to be a definitely established policy in the 
United States of levying separate taxes for schools. This 
policy is universal on the district level wherever the district 
unit of support is recognized at all. It appears upon the 
State level in fully half the States. Upon the county or 
1 The data summarized in this section were obtained from the summaries 
of State laws concerning education appearing in the following Bulletins of 
the National Bureau of Education: Bulletin no. 47 (1915); Bulletin no, 23 
(1918); Bulletin no. 30 (1920). ‘

other intermediate level it is increasing. Possibly the only 
notable change in this policy to be expected is a consider- 
able reduction in local district taxation, if not its complete 
elimination; but this question brings up once more the 
mooted question of district support, which has been dealt 
with in another place. 
Other, more technical, criticisms can only be mentioned. 
Against the policy of levying special school taxes it is argued 
that such a policy is inconsistent with the policy of separa- 
tion of sources discussed above, and that real property is 
likely to be forced to continue to bear more than its proper 
share of the tax burden. The view prevailing among econo- 
mists seems to be that school taxes should be absorbed into 
the general taxation scheme, rather than left as independent 
measures for the serving of special ends. 
Chapter summary. This chapter has raised for considera- 
tion the question of the sources from which public school 
revenues are and should be derived. This question is the 
third and final question to be considered in this book. 
Starting with a variety of sources in the colonial period of 
American history, the schools have now reduced the number 
to three. By far the most important of these three is public 
taxation, which contributes more than nine tenths of the 
total income required for the schools. Lands and invested 
funds, and incidental sources, yield together less than one 
tenth. 
The permanent school funds originated in the main in the 
land grants made by the Nation to the States early in the 
nineteenth century, and in later supplementary grants of 
money. A few States have provided the means for their 
own permanent funds. The extent of these grants and be- 
quests was truly magnificent, and once appeared to justify 
the expectation that their income would suffice for the needs 
of public education for all the future. School needs, how- 
 
-P-A-G-E-376
| 362 PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE 
ever, have increased far beyond the early expectations, and 
much of the original endowment has been sacrificed through 
mismanagement, so that the permanent school funds are now 
a very inconsiderable item among the sources of public school 
support. Not one twentieth of the total revenue required, 
even at present rates of expenditure, comes from this source. 
It has been urged by some writers that the past services per- 
formed by these funds in the way of stimulating local en- 
deavor are such as to justify an effort to increase them 
largely in the future. Others, however, hold that if they 
were made much larger they would interfere materially with 
the proper support of schools from other sources, particularly 
from taxation. It is generally admitted that they have 
rendered a very significant service in past times. 
The incidental sources of school revenue are varied in type, 
and now yield only comparatively little revenue. They are 
mainly a device for making creditable use of money derived 
from fines, etc., rather than a necessary revenue source for 
education. So far as the schools are concerned, they could 
readily be dispensed with in most States. 
Taxation is the great source of supply for the public 
schools. Direct taxes for schools are levied by districts, 
both common and independent, by towns, townships, and 
counties, and by States. | Also, money is frequently ap- 
propriated for schools by States out of the “ general revenue,” 
derived in the main from taxes not levied specifically for 
schools. The present agitation for increased school support 
thus becomes principally an agitation for increased taxation, 
and naturally raises for review the whole taxation system. 
School-men must therefore familiarize themselves with the 
larger problem of tax reform in general, and, on the other 
_ side, the forces making for reform in taxation should invite 
the codperation of progressive school people. To illustrate 
this point, as well as to provide a basis for thinking and dis-

cussion, this chapter has included a summary of a model 
plan, advanced by competent authorities, for improving our 
State and local systems of taxation. This plan must not be 
taken as the final word on the subject, or even as the best 
possible plan so far as it goes. But it is worthy of careful 
consideration both because of its authorship and because it is 
representative of the direction actually being taken by the 
tax-reform movement in several States. 
TOPICS FOR INVESTIGATION AND DISCUSSION 
1. Summarize, either in writing or by means of a diagram, the sources of 
school support used in your State. Compare the relative importance 
of each source in your State with its importance in other States. 
Study your State’s utilization of sources with a view to suggesting im- 
provements. 
2. Follow the same course outlined in the paragraph above. In this case, 
however, take as the object of your study the taxation system existing 
in your State. 
3. Make a critical study of movements. evident in your State, bearing 
upon the improvements of school support and of the general taxation 
system. 
4. State and discuss several important ways in which teachers and other 
school people can become influential factors in securing reforms in 
taxation. What dangers lurk in such participation? How avoid 
them? 
5. Examine the California plan for State and local taxation, and compare 
it with the Model Plan of the National Tax Association.

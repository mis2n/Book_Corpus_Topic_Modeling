PREFACE TO THE SERIES 
Tunis series consists of five volumes, four of which are intended 
as textbooks for pupils in manual-training, industrial, trade, tech- 
nical, ornormal schools. The fifth book of the series, the “ Hand- 
book in Woodwork and Carpentry,” is for the use of teachers and 
of normal students who expect to teach the subjects treated in the 
other four volumes. 
Of the pupils’ volumes, the first two, “ Elements of Woodwork ” 
and “ Elements of Construction,” are adapted to the needs of stu- 
dents in manual-training schools, or in any institution in which 
elementary woodwork is taught, whether as purely educational 
handwork, or as preparatory to a high, or trade, school course in 
carpentry or vocational training. 
~The volumes “Constructive Carpentry” and “Inside Finish- 
ing” are planned with special reference to the students of tech- 
nical, industrial, or trade schools, who have passed through the 
work of the first two volumes, or their equivalent. The subjects 
treated are those which will be of greatest value to both the pro- 
spective and the finished workman. 
For the many teachers who are obliged to follow a required 
course, but who are allowed to introduce supplementary or 
optional models under certain conditions, and for others who 
have more liberty and are able to make such changes as they 
see fit, this series will be found perfectly adaptable, regardless 
of the grades taught. 'o accomplish this, the material has been 
arranged by topics, which may be used by the teacher irrespective 
of the sequence, as each topic has to the greatest extent possible 
been treated independently.

  iv PREFACE TO THE SERIES 
The author is indebted to Dr. George A. Hubbell, Ph.D., now 
President of the Lincoln Memorial University, for encouragement 
and advice in preparing for and planning the series, and to 
George R. Swain, Principal of the Eastern High School of Bay 
City, Michigan, for valuable aid in revising the manuscript. 
Acknowledgment is due various educational and trade periodi- 
cals, and the publications of the United States Departments of 
Education and of Forestry, for the helpful suggestions that the 
author has gleaned from their pages. 
The illustrations in this Series, with the exception of the pho- 
tographs in “Elements of Woodwork” and “Elements of Con- 
struction,” are from drawings made by the author.

PREFACE TO ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
Tus volume deals with the use of the common woodworking 
tools, the simple forms of construction used in fastening wood 
together, and the reading and understanding of simple drawings 
—all of which will be found of indispensable value, not only 
to the student of manual training, but to those who, either as 
amateurs or professionals, have anything to do with work of a 
mechanical nature. 
The problems in elementary construction are intended to 
familiarize the pupil with their various uses, and one or more 
of these problems, bearing upon the work he is to do, should 
precede the undertaking of any really important work. 
Students should be encouraged to create new models or exer- 
cises for themselves, following those shown only as a guide to 
the degree of difficulty or for suggestions as to methods of 
construction. 
The arithmetic problems in this volume are intended to be 
used in connection with the class work, the teacher adapting 
them to his uses as may seem best. They are of the same nature 
as those with which the workman will come in daily contact, 
and should be used as the basis for mental drill as much as 
possible and for the teaching of the short cuts which the man 
in business should acquire.

CHAPTER I 
Toots 
1. How to purchase tools. — (A.) The quality of the 
tools used by the mechanic is of the greatest importance. 
They should be selected carefully, and while it is the 
poorest economy to buy any but the best, the best are 
not necessarily the most finely finished. 
(B.) In purchasing tools, it is well to remember that 
those made especially for some dealer, and bearing his 
name, if sold for a less price than the best, are usually not 
of the highest grade, and should be shunned. It is wisest 
to buy standard makes, examining them carefully to be 
sure that there are no visible defects. The temper of 
steel may be discovered only by use, and any defect in 
the best grades of tools is made good upon complaint to 
the dealer. 
2. Benches.—(A.) Figure 1 shows the type of bench 
used in the most up-to-date carpenter and cabinet-shops, 
while that used by carpenters for ordinary work usually is - 
of the type shown in Fig. 2. 
(B.) In many manual-training schools, the benches are 
of the former type, and, in the most completely equipped 
schools, are fitted with locked drawers and closets for the 
reception of tools, not only to keep the latter in condition 
for use, but to insure that the outfit is complete, and to 
make it possible to place the responsibility for damage 
or loss.

(C.) The vises should be of the modern, quick action 
design, which, on account of the rapidity with which they 
work, are superseding the old-fashioned wooden and iron 
screw vises.

3. Rules. — The two-foot, four-fold rule (Fig. 3) is the 
one generally used by carpenters. It is made of dif- 
ferent grades, the more expensive makes 
being divided into 16ths, 8ths, 10ths, and 
12ths, and having the 3’, 4”, 3”, 3”, 2’, 
1”, 14”, and 3” scales upon them. Al- 
though the cheaper rule is just as ac- 
curate, it is divided usually into 8ths and 
16ths only. The form of rule shown in 
Fig. 4 is becoming quite popular, as it 
is longer. Since rules are easily lost or 
broken, many workmen have a good rule 
for scaling, and a cheaper one for gen- 
eral work. Fie. 4.— Ziazaa 
4. The try-square (A.) consists of the Leen 
beam (Fig. 5, a), which is generally of metal-lined wood, 
and the blade (6), which is a thin piece of steel. 
(B.) Too much care cannot be exercised in the selec- 
tion of this tool, as one which is not perfectly true may 
cause much trouble. To test a square, hold the beam

against a perfectly straight and square edge of a board 
which is wide enough to allow a knife line to be made the 
entire length of the blade. Then turn the square over,
-P-A-G-E-19
  TOOLS 5 
the other side up, and, holding the beam against the same 
edge, move the blade to the line. If the jointed edge 
of the board and the square are perfectly accurate, the 
knife line and the edge of the board will perfectly coincide. — 
(C.) The use of this 
tool in squaring an 
edge is shown in Fig. 
5. The piece being 
squared should be in 
such a position that 
the try-square will be 
between the eye and 
the light; in this way, 
the slightest inaccu- 
racy may be detected. 
In Fig. 7 is shown 
the position of the 
try-square when used 
to make a line by the 
edge of the blade.

edge indicated, hold 
the beam against the edge with the thumb, and at the 
same time hold the blade down with one or two fingers, 
using the others to steady the square in its place upon 
~ the board. 
(D.) Two try-squares may be used to see if a piece of 
wood is “out of wind” (¢ sounded as in kind) by the 
method indicated in Fig. 6. 
Two pieces of wood known as winding sticks, of ex- 
actly the same width and perfectly parallel, are often 
used in manual-training schools for this purpose; they

are rarely used in a shop, however, as a workman gen- 
erally will use two steel squares if the piece is too

large to be sighted accurately without some aid of 
this sort. 
5. The steel, or framing, square (Fig. 8) is often used 
as a try-square upon large work, though its most im- 
portant use is in framing or roof construction. It is indis- 
see in finding the lengths and the angles of rafters, 
braces, etc. Its use for this 
purpose will be explained 
n ‘ Constructive Carpen- 
try.” The long side of the 
framing square is known as 
the “ blade,’’ and the short 
side as the “ tongue.”

7. The gauge (A.), Fig. 10, is for the purpose of mak- 
ing lines parallel to the face or working side or edge. 
Usually it is made in four 
pieces: the “head” (a), 
which is held against the face 
side or edge; the “ stick” 
(bb), upon which the head 
moves; the “thumbscrew ” 
(ce), which holds the head 
firmly in its position upon 
the stick ; and the “point oF Fic. 10.— Marxine Gavce. 
(d), which makes the desired “ the ee ae the thumb- 
mark upon the wood. 
(B.) A rule should be used in setting the gauge, unless 
one is certain that the point is located accurately with 
regard to the graduations upon the stick. 
The point should be sharpened to work with either a 
push or pull cut, as at e. 
(C.) The gauge should be grasped as shown in Fig. 11, 
and generally used with a push, though it is occasionally 
pulled toward the worker. One should always work from 
the face side of the piece. 
If the point enters the wood too deeply, it may be set 
back, or the gauge carried on the corner of the stick as indi- 
eated, which will govern the depth of the cut. Do not use 
a dull gauge, or one with a round point like a pencil, as 
it will tear the wood, instead of making a clean cut or 
scratch. 
8. The hammer (A.) is used by the average wood- 
worker more than any other tool. The “face” (Fig. 
12, a) and the “claws” (b) should be tempered care- 
fully, as they will either bruise or bend if too soft, or

so that the handle may be firmly wedged in the eye or 
socket. The neck (d), by extending upon the handle as it 
does, adds much to the strength of the connection.

The handlé should be of young, tough, straight-grained

-P-A-G-E-23
  TOOLS 9 
The grain should be perfectly straight at the neck, and 
the annual layers should show lengthwise of the ellipse at 
the end, as ate. The handle should be fitted and wedged, 
or “ hung” in such a way that a nail may be driven home 
in a flat surface without the knuckles striking, which 
means that the center of the handle should be about paral- 
lel with the flat surface. A line lengthwise of the head 
through the eye should exactly coincide with the long, or 
major, axis of the ellipse at the end of the handle, as at gg, 
or pounded fingers will result. 
The bell-faced hammer is to be preferred to the flat- 
Jaced type, as it will not mar the wood so badly if the nail is 
missed, though more skill is required to use it. Upon rough 
work, the bell-faced hammer will sink the nail beneath the 
surface without bruising the wood badly. Upon inside 
work, the nails should be sunk beneath the surface with 
a nail set. 
(B.) In nailing, the young workman should acquire the 
habit of grasping the handle of the hammer at the end, 
as this will give greater force to the 
blow. Upon light work, the hand 
will naturally slip a little toward 
the head. Nails should generally 
be driven in a slanting direction, 
as they hold better than if driven 
straight. When nails are driven as 
shown at a, Fig. 13, it is called 
“ toenailing,”’ and when driven suffi- 
ciently to hold, but not driven home, : 
as at b, they are said to be “tacked.” Nails are driven 
this way when they are to be pulled out again, as in stay 
laths, and in fastening pieces temporarily.

In forcing matched boards together, do not pound 
directly upon the tongue edge of the board, but upon a 
- waste piece of the same material, as the tongue will be 
bruised so that the 
next board will not 
form a good joint. 
Care should be used 
that the hammer 
does not strike the 
edge of the board 
when the nail is 
driven home. To 
guard against this, a 
nail set should be 
used to sink the 
head beneath the sur- 
face, as in Fig. 14, so 
that the next board 
will come to its place 
without trouble. 
This is called ‘blind

(A.) is used for hew- 
ing light work, for shingling, and as a heavy hammer, 
though the face is rarely tempered to stand very heavy 
usage (Fig. 15, a). 
(B.) A hand az, or broad hatchet (Fig. 15, b), usually 
is a better grade of tool than the hatchet, and as it is of 
greater weight, is better adapted for heavy work. For 
general use it should be sharpened as atc; but for hewing 
to a line, an edge like d gives the best results.

will always strike a fair

allows the mallet to turn in

made elliptical, like a hammer 
handle, there would be less 
likelihood of missing the chisel

The teeth of a ripsaw (Fig. 17, A) are suitable for sawing 
in a direction parallel with the general direction of the 
grain. The points of different saws may be from one 
third to one seventh of an inch apart, and form a series of 
chisels, the cutting edges of which are filed so that they

(In each of the three varieties of saw teeth shown 
above, the set of the teeth is exaggerated.) a little deeper than 
the one preceding 
it. 
The .cutting-off 
saw (Fig. 17, B) has 
from six to twelve 
knife-pointed teeth 
to an inch, the cut- 
ting edges being 
parallel to the sides 
of the blade, and 
“filed so that the 
point of the tooth 
is upon the side 
which is set beyond 
the side of the blade. 
In all except the 
finest saws, the 
teeth are set; that 
is, the points are 
bent a very little in 
such a way as to 
make the cut wider 
than the thickness 
of the blade, so that 
the saw may cut 
through the wood 
without binding, 
which it could not 
do if the cut were of the same thickness as the blade. The
-P-A-G-E-27
  TOOLS 13 
blades of all high grade saws are thinner upon the back than 
upon the cutting edge, but if a saw is to be used upon the 
finest work, this difference in the thickness of the two edges 
of the blade is supposed to make the setting of the saw un- 
necessary. For general work, it will be found that a saw 
will be much more efficient if it is given a set adapted to 
the size of the teeth, or to the nature of the work it is 
expected to do. 
The compass, or keyhole, saw (Fig. 17, C) is used where 
it is necessary that the saw should cut both with and across 
the grain. It is used to start the cut for a rip- or cutting- 
off saw, when a cut has to be made in the surface of a 
board. This saw is used also in many places where it is 
not practicable to use a larger saw, and for sawing curves. 
In order to allow it to cut around curves easily, the face, or 
cutting edge, is considerably thicker than the back, and 
the blade is made of soft metal. It may then be given 
a heavy set, so that it will bend instead of breaking or 
kinking, as it would be liable to do from the nature of its 
work if made of tempered steel. 
Some carpenters, working upon job work, where it is 
desirable to carry as few tools as possible, have a narrow 
20” or 22” saw sharpened like 
a compass saw, which for 
ordinary work is quite satis- 
factory as either a cutting-off 
or a ripsaw, thus making 
another saw unnecessary. 
The backsaw (Fig. 18) is used upon fine work; it is 
filed like a cutting-off saw, but the teeth have rather 
more hook, and it often has as many as fifteen teeth to the 
inch, though a twelve-tooth saw is as fine as is generally 
  Fra. 18.—Backsaw.
-P-A-G-E-28

14 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
used. The thick back is to stiffen the blade of the saw, 
and if the latter becomes sprung, a light blow upon the 
back, as though to drive it upon the blade, will usually 
straighten it. 
(B.) In buying a saw, select one which is thicker upon 
the cutting edge than upon the back; this allows the saw 
to be used upon very fine work with little or no setting. 
See that the handle fits the hand, and that the saw hangs to 
suit, or “feels right.”” This is a matter concerning the 
balance and the weight of the tool, which cannot be de- 
scribed, but which any one accustomed to using tools will 
miss when a tool not possessing this quality is placed in 
his hand. 
A saw blade, unless very short and thick, should bend 
so that the point may be put through the handle, and, 
upon being released, should instantly resume its shape. It 
should also bend evenly in proportion to the width and 
the gauge of the saw, and should be as thin as the stiff- 
ness of the blade will permit, as a saw of this sort cuts less 
wood and therefore runs with less resistance. A com- 
pass saw, being softer, is not expected to stand the 
above test. : 
A 26” or a 28” blade is best for a heavy rip- or cutting- 
off saw to be used upon coarse work; but for fine work, 
a 22’’ blade, commonly known as a “ panel saw,” is a con- 
venient size, though a 20” or a 24” blade is preferred by 
many workmen. 
(C.) A hard saw is best for fine work. For general 
work, most workmen prefer a saw of medium hardness, 
as the teeth of a hard saw are apt to break in setting. 
Moreover the edge of a hard saw, if it comes in con- 
tact with metal, requires filing just about as quickly
-P-A-G-E-29
  
as that of a soft 
to sharpen than 
the latter. If 
always filed by 
an expert filer, 
however, a hard 
saw is superior in 
every way to any 
other. 
(D.) The handle 
of the saw should 
be grasped firmly 
-by three fingers, 
as atin Hig... 19;

finger extended 
along the side of 
the saw, thus TOOLS 15

    hee ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
making more room for the three fingers, and giving 
better control of the saw. Very little strength should 
be used in forcing a fine saw to 
cut, as its own weight generally is 
sufficient. If the saw is forced, it will 
not run smoothly, but will bind; and 
if a thin board is being worked, the 
saw is apt to splitit. The saw should 
be used from the face side of the 
material, so that any splinters or variation will be upon 
the back side and out of sight. 
(E.) It is the custom of some carpenters to reset the 
handles of their heavy saws by drilling holes through the 
blade, so that the handle may be fastened as close to 
the cutting edge as possible, as in Fig. 20. This brings the 
force of the stroke nearer the direct line of the cut, which 
obviously allows a more economical application of force. 
Never leave a saw in a cut, for if the piece of wood falls off 
the trestles, the saw is apt to be broken. (Saw-filing will 
be discussed later.)

(C.) Our modern planes are more easily adjusted and 
more convenient to use, though they will do no better 
work than the wooden planes of our forefathers, which are 
still preferred by many of the best workmen. The face of 
an iron plane holds its shape permanently, while it is 
necessary that the wooden plane should be jointed 
occasionally.

(D.) There are planes for every conceivable purpose, 
all constructed upon the same general principle as the 
common bench plane which 
we shall discuss later. These 
planes are adjusted by screws

a Improperty Apsustep Cap The adjustment of the 
j modern plane may be under- 
stood by a careful study of Fig. 22 and by comparing 
it with the plane itself. The ‘“ cutter,” ‘ iron,” or “ bit” 
(1) and the ‘cap iron”’ (2) are the essentials of the tool, and 
it is upon their condition and adjustment that the effi- 
ciency of the plane depends. If the cap iron is set too 
far from the edge of the iron, and if the cut is made against 
the grain, the shaving will not break before it leads the 
iron into the wood, as shown in 
Fig. 23. If the cap iron is set 
somewhat less than 75”" from 
the edge of the cutter, accord- 
ing to the wood being planed, 
it will break the shaving nearly 
as soon as it is cut, as in Fig. 24, 
and will result ina smooth, clean Fic. 24.—Resurr or Usine : Prange with Cap Iron Ap- surface. The closer the cap iron — jysrmp Prorery. 
is set to the edge, the smoother 
the iron will cut, as the breaks in the shaving are thereby 
made shorter. 
It will be seen also that the closer the bottom of the cap 
   
-P-A-G-E-33
TOOLS, 19 
iron (2) is set to the edge of the cutter (1), the shorter the 
breaks will be, as in Fig. 24, and the more smoothly the 
plane willcut. The plane “iron screw” (3) holds the edge of 
the cutter (1) and the bottom of the cap iron (2) in their 
desired relation. The “‘cap lever” (4), being pressed against 
the under side of the head of the ‘‘cap screw” (5) by the 
“cam” (4a), holds the iron in its place, and presses the 
cap iron (2) firmly against the top of the cutter (1). Un- 
less the cap iron fits the face of the cutter perfectly, the 
plane will not work satisfactorily. The “frog” (6) 
carries all the adjusting mechanism of the plane, and may 
be moved backward or forward to.reduce or enlarge the 
“mouth” (6 a), which should be no larger than is nec- 
essary to allow the shavings to pass freely. The frog 
rarely will require readjusting after it has been properly 
located. 
The “ Y lever” (7) forces the plane irons (1 and 2) 
in or out simultaneously, which governs the projection, 
or “set,” of the edge of the cutter (1) beyond the face, or 
“sole” (b), of the “ plane stock,” and thus the thickness 
of the shaving which the plane will cut. The “ adjusting 
nut ”’ (8) moves freely upon the “ screw ” (8 a) and oper- 
ates the Y lever (7). The “lateral adjustment” (9) is for 
- the purpose of forcing the iron to cut in the exact center of 
the width of the face (b) of the plane. The two “ frog 
screws” (10) hold the frog rigidly in the position which 
will make the throat (6 a) of the desired size. 
The above illustrates all the adjusting mechanism; the 
other parts of the plane are as follows: ‘‘ handle” (11) ; 
"knob ” (12); ““handle bolt.” and “‘ nut” (13); “knob 
bolt ” and “nut” (14); “handle screw” (15); ‘ bot- 
tom,” or “ stock ” (16).
-P-A-G-E-34
  20 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
The face, or sole, of the plane (6) must be perfectly 
straight, or good work cannot be done. The ends of the 
plane (A and ¢) are 
called the “‘heel’’ and 
“toe,” respectively. 
The “mouth” of the 
plane (between 6a 
and 2) must be kept 
clear of shavings, 
or it may become 
clogged. 
(E.) In setting a 
plane, do not pass 
the fingers over the 
face, or sole, as cut 
fingers may result. 
Hold the plane as 
shown in Fig. 25, 
and look toward the’ 
light, when the exact 
projection of the cutter may be seen. Notice the position 
of the fingers of the left hand, and that the eye glances 
from toe to heel. This leaves the right hand free to make 
the adjustments. This is a workmanlike way of setting a 
plane, and in this, as in all handling of tools, awkwardness 
should be avoided. 
14. Sharpening a plane. — (A.) An important part of 
this process is the grinding of the cutter. Set the cap 
back about 3” from the edge of the iron, and use it as a 
guide by which to grind the iron perfectly square, as at 
A, Fig. 26. The cap iron should be kept perfectly square, 
and never touched except to fit it to the cutter, or, if it is 
  Fic. 25.—Serrina a PLane.
-P-A-G-E-35
  TOOLS 21 
too thick to allow the shavings to pass freely, to file the 
top of it to the proper thickness. If the tool is kept in 
order skillfully, the cap 
will need care only upon 
rare occasions. 
The cutter should be 
held firmly to the grind- 
stone. or emery. wheel 
and kept moving from 
side to side to prevent 
wearing the stone in 
one place. The grind-

be held upon the stone 
at an angle of about 20° (as at B, Fig. 26), more rather than 
less, as a thinner edge is apt to “ chatter,” or vibrate, if 
it strikes a hard place in the wood. Many workmen use 
a rest when grinding; this insures a true bevel. Any 
device which holds the tool firmly at the same place on 
the stone will do for a rest. 
In whetting the cutter, the screw of the cap iron should 
be loosened and the cap iron carried back until the screw 
stops at the top of the slot of the bit, as at C, Fig. 26. 
The screw is then tightened with the fingers to hold the 
cap in place; this gives a better grasp of the iron, though 
some workmen prefer to take the cap off entirely while 
whetting. 
The bevel of the iron should be held exactly upon the 
surface of the oilstone, as shown at C, Fig. 26, the iron 
being grasped as in Fig. 27. Keep the right wrist rigid
-P-A-G-E-36
22 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
and allow the arm to swing from the shoulder, bending 
only at the elbow. In this way the rocking motion may 
be reduced to a minimum; this is necessary to preserve 
the bevel. Though the bevel may be maintained better 
by imparting a short circular motion to the plane iron, 
or to any edge tool which is being sharpened, it seems

an awkward and fussy method of work, and rarely is 
used by an expert workman. By long practice the 
mechanic finds that a stroke made nearly the entire 
length of the stone will impart an edge quicker, and, 
after the knack has been acquired, that the bevel will be 
preserved just as well. 
Turn the whetstone end for end frequently, and work 
upon the farther end, as in this way the stone may be 
kept true much longer than if one place upon it is used all 
the time. This will also minimize the danger of pulling 
the tool off from the nearer end of the stone, which will 
generally make regrinding necessary.
-P-A-G-E-37
        
TOOLS 23 
When the beveled side has been whetted, lay the face, 
or the top, of the iron, perfectly flat upon the stone, as in 
Fig. 28, holding it down with the fingers of the left hand, 
using the right hand only to move the iron back and forth. 
Care should be used that under no circumstances is the 
face of the iron lifted the slightest degree from the stone. 
  
  Fic. 28.— WuHeErtinc, or OILsToNING, THE PLAIN Stipe or THE PLANE IRON. 
At this stage of sharpening a plane iron, the utmost care 
is necessary that the face of the cutter does not lose its 
perfectly straight surface at the edge, as the slightest 
deviation from absolute accuracy at this place will prevent 
the cap iron from fitting properly. Such a deviation 
will cause endless trouble, as the shavings will be forced 
between the cap and the face of the iron (see C. of this 
topic). 
(B.) The shape of the cutting edge of the plane cutter
-P-A-G-E-38
  24 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
has an important influence upon its efficiency. Imagine 
the edge divided into three equal parts: the middle part 
ee should be perfectly straight, or almost im- 
— perceptibly rounded; the two outside thirds 
should be slightly and gradually rounded 
until the corners of the iron are so short that 
Fic. 29—Suarn there will be no danger of their projecting 
Oe Or below the face of the plane. This gives 
the cutting edge an elliptical shape, as 
illustrated in Fig. 29, which is somewhat exaggerated, 
as the shape shown is about that which would be 
seen if a moderately coarse jack plane were held as 
in Fig. 25. 
(C.) In order to insure fine work, the cap iron must be 
fitted so carefully to the face and to the edge of the cutter 
that, if necessary, it may be placed at less than #:th of an 
inch from the cutting edge, though this would rarely be 
required except upon very cross-grained wood. 
In fitting the cap iron to the top of the cutter, a very 
fine, sharp file should be used. The filing must all 
be done upon the under side of the cap iron, at the 
places where the latter rests upon the face, or top, of 
the cutter; or, if preferred, the cap may be very care- 
fully bent. Except in cases where there is considerable 
fitting necessary, however, this second method is. not 
recommended, unless the joint is perfected by the use 
of a file. 
If sufficient care and skill are exercised, a plane may be 
sharpened and adjusted so finely that a veneer of .01’ 
or less in thickness of bird’s-eye maple, burl walnut, 
ash, or similar wood may be smoothed. It is not wise, 
however, to spend the time necessary to keep a plane
-P-A-G-E-39
TOOLS 25 
sharpened and adjusted to do this fine quality of work, 
as the use of a scraper and sandpaper, or of the latter 
alone, is the most economical way to smooth woods of 
such nature. 
(D.) To remedy clogging of the mouth, remove the con- 
ditions which cause it; simply digging out the shavings 
is useless. An improperly fitted cap iron is one of the 
principal causes of trouble; the cutter may be ground so 
thin that, when it is forced against a knot or hard place, 
the iron chatters, which allows the shavings an entrance 
under the cap iron. In this lies the only real advan- 
tage of a wooden plane over the modern iron plane, as in 
the former: the iron is much thicker and stiffer. The 
cap iron may be so thick that it causes the shavings to 
curl too much, or the frog may be set too far to the 
front, which will make the mouth too small. This latter 
may be remedied by moving the frog back, but in a 
wooden plane, the mouth and the throat must be cut 
larger in order to allow the shavings to clear themselves 
properly. 
      
      
    15. The jack plane (Fig. 30) generally is 15’’ long, 
and its ordinary use is for the purpose of roughing out a 
piece of wood for jointing or smoothing. If it is properly

jointer upon small work, as it is capable of doing as good 
work as any plane. 
The jack plane generally is ground more rounding than 
are the other planes, and the cap set farther back, espe- 
cially if it is to be used upon rough work.

long, and is used to straighten edges and surfaces, or to

fit them together. The shape of the edge of the cutter 
of this plane should be but slightly elliptical, less so than 
that of the jack plane or the smoother, unless the two 
latter are fitted for doing very fine work. 
(B.) In using a jointer for squaring or jointing an edge,
-P-A-G-E-41
TOOLS 27 
it should be carried to one side or the other of its face, as 
may be necessary, to take advantage of the elliptically 
shaped edge of the cutter. This may be done by 
cutting a shaving thicker on one edge than on the 
other, thus making the edge of the board square with the 
face side. 
To make a perfectly square edge, the cut should be 
made in the center of both the iron and the width of the 
face of the plane. The plane should be held as shown 
in Fig. 31, with the fingers under the face of the plane, 
and the tops of the finger nails touching the board lightly, 
guiding the plane, and keeping the bit cutting in one 
place upon its edge. 
17. The smoothing plane (A.) is of the same type and 
mechanism as those described above, though it is but 
9 or 10” long; if satisfactory work is expected from it, 
it must be kept in good order, with the cap iron perfectly 
fitted. For general work, it is not necessary to spend the 
time, to insure that the plane should be continually in 
readiness to work upon hard, tough, cross-grained wood, 
asa plane adjusted to do the latter kind of work well is 
unnecessary upon softer or straight-grained wood. For 
ordinary work, the cap iron should be set from #3’’ to 75’ 
from the edge of the bit; but for the finest “ile the 
closer to the edge it will fit and allow a shaving to be 
taken, the finer the work that may be done. No wood 
used upon ordinary work is so cross-grained or knurly 
that it cannot be smoothed economically, if a properly 
sharpened and adjusted plane is used. 
(B.) A smoothing plane should cut a shaving | as 
nearly the entire width of the bit as possible; there-

is so placed in the stock of 
the plane that its cutting 
angle is as nearly in line with 
the cut as possible, the

19. The correct position. —(A.) In using planes, or 
any edge tools, a position should be taken which will 
furnish sufficient resistance to the pressure required for 
making the cut, as the pressure should be applied firmly 
and steadily. With experience, the correct position will 
be taken involuntarily; the beginner, however, should be

continually upon the watch to overcome his awkward- 
ness. 
(B.) The habit of bending from the hips is acquired 
easily. The young workman should learn to work 
in as nearly an erect position as possible, for if the 
bending of the shoulders is persisted in, a permanent 
stoop will result. Stand facing the work and clear 
of the bench in order to prevent unnecessary wear of 
the clothing. 
(C.) Do not allow the plane to drop over the end 
of the board at either the 
beginning or the end of 
the stroke, as indicated at 
A, B, Fig. 36. To pre 
Hrs Po ncoenaey Use ov ua ventithis, thehendehould 
be kept upon that part of 
the plane which is upon the board; at the beginning of 
the stroke, the weight should be upon the front end of the 
plane, as in Fig. 36, and at the end of the stroke, upon the 
rear end, or upon the handle, as in Fig. 37. Begin and end 
each stroke with a lifting motion, instead of allowing the 
plane to drop as it leaves or enters the wood. The plane 
should be held firmly, not rigidly; do not allow it to 
jump; this is caused generally by an attempt to take 
a shaving heavier than the plane should cut, or, if 
the cap iron is fitted and adjusted properly, by a dull 
iron. <A cutter will jump or chatter if it does not fit 
solidly against the frog. In drawing the plane back 
after making a stroke, carry it upon the toe, or upon 
one corner; do not drag it flat upon its face, as the 
iron is thereby dulled as much as when it is cutting, or 
possibly more.

(D.) Carry the plane parallel with the grain when it is 
possible, and take no more shavings off than is necessary 
to attain the desired results. The young workman should 
make a study of the grain and the peculiarities of the 
different kinds of lumber upon which he works, losing no 
opportunity to experiment upon and compare the qualities 
of every available wood. 
(E.) In using edge tools of any kind, little is gained, 
and much is often lost, by working with dull tools; tools 
should be sharpened often and thoroughly. This is of the 
utmost importance, for even with the tools in the best 
possible order, it will require much care and skill to do 
good work. 
20. Chisels. — (A.) Carpenters’ chisels are -used for 
paring and mortising. The paring chisel should be light, 
smoothly finished, and ground with a sharper bevel than 
that used for mortising, for which the heaviest chisel is 
none too strong. 
(B.) Chisels are “tanged” or “ socket,’ according 
to the method by which the blade and handle are joined. 
The tanged firmer chisel (Fig. 38, A) is the older form, 
and is not so strong as the more recently designed 
socket chisel (B). For light work, the tanged chisel 
is preferred by many, but more commonly the socket 
chisel is used, as it is stiffer, not so easily broken, and 
has no shoulder to catch upon the edge of the wood 
when the tool is used. The beveled-edge chisel (C) is 
a favorite tool with pattern makers; and the mortise, 
or framing chisel (D), is designed for heavy use. A 
set of chisels consists of one each of the following 
dimensions : ie ¥, aie #, Oe VG ay 12, 12”, 1, 
12”, Q",

TOOLS 33 
(C.) A large, heavy chisel, 34’ or 4’’ in width, called 
a “slice” or ‘slick,’ is used, like a paring chisel, upon 
heavy work. 
(D.) Handles for paring chisels may be of any hard 
wood and of any convenient shape, as these should not 
be pounded upon. Although they 
are occasionally used for cutting 
small mortises, it is not a good 
practice, unless the tops of the 
handles are protected by leather 
or fiber tops. Mortising chisels 
should have handles of the tough- 
est wood obtainable, preferably 
hickory, with leather nailed with 
small brads upon the top to pro- 
tect the wood. If a leather 
washer is fastened to the handle 
by a pin or dowel, the wood will Wie. 38: Caine:

essary. An iron ring, or ferrule, is used by many to 
prevent the handle from splitting, but this will bruise 
the face of the mallet. A hammer should never be 
used upon any sort of wooden handle, as the handle 
will very quickly be destroyed, but a mallet will in- 
jure it comparatively little. In fitting the handle to 
the chisel blade, care should be used that they are in 
perfect alignment, as otherwise a sharp blow may break 
the blade. 
(E.) In sharpening a mortise chisel, it should be ground

34 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
at an angle of not less than 30°, as a thinner edge is 
liable to break upon coming in contact with a knot. A 
paring chisel may be ground as 
thin as 20°, as it does not have 
to stand heavy blows, and a bet- 
ter edge for the purpose may 
thus be obtained. In whetting a 
chisel, the bevel must be care- 
fully maintained, and the back kept perfectly straight, 
like the face of a plane iron, as otherwise it will be 
impossible to work to a line. 
21. Gouges may, in general, be described in the same 
way as chisels, except that they are curved instead of flat. 
The terms “ inside”? and “ outside,’’ used in describing 
them, indicate whether they are ground upon the inside 
or the outside of the curve. 
22. The drawshave (Fig. 39) is often used in cutting 
curves, in, chamfering, and for roughing out work. The 
patent drawshave, with folding handles, is a safer tool to 
keep in the tool box, as the edge is protected, but it is not 
so satisfactory for general work as the ordinary rigid- 
handled tool. If the latter is used, a piece of wood should 
be fitted over the edge to protect both it and the hands 
when the tool is not in use. 
23. The spokeshave (Fig. 40) 
should not be used in any place ae fi 
where a plane can be used, eC pie ince eee 
but only upon concave or con- 
vex surfaces; when used, it may be either pushed or 
pulled. 
24. Bits (A.) are of many different types, the most com- 
mon being the auger bit (Fig. 41). The use of the ‘‘ worm ”

-P-A-G-E-49
  TOOLS 35 
(a) is to draw the bit into the wood, thus making a heavy 
pressure upon the bit unnecessary. The “lips” (bb) 
make an incision on the 
wood below the cut made * 
by the “ cutters” (cc), which Be atari 
take the shavings out and 
into the “twist,” this in turn lifting them out of the 
hole. 
(B.) Care should be used when boring a deep hole that 
the bit is removed before the shavings clog in the twist, 
which will happen if the hole becomes full of shavings 
that cannot be lifted out. Should clogging occur, do 
not use a great deal of strength in trying to back the bit 
out, or its “shank” may be twisted off; it is better to pull 
it out with a straight pull by means of a lever, if suffi- 
cient strength cannot be otherwise exerted, the pull being’ 
straight over the-center of the bit from the “ chuck,” not 
from the head of the bitbrae: 
After boring the hole to 
the desired depth, do not 
turn the bit’ backward to 
remove it, as shavings will 
be left in the hole, but give 
it one turn back to loosen the 
worm, then turn as though 
boring the hole deeper, lift- 
ing under the head of the 
bitbrace in the meantime, 
by which process the shay- 
ings will be lifted out. These 
bits are numbered by 16ths from ths to }§ths of an 
inch. Sizes larger than these are known as augers.

are called augers. The form shown is known 
as a “ Ford” auger. 
(D.) The German bit (Fig. 48, A) is used for 
boring small holes for serews and nails, and 
has entirely supplanted the gimlet of our fore- 
fathers, as its action is much more rapid. Its 
progression in sizes is from 75’ to 43” by 32ds 
of an inch; this tool is also called a screw 
bit. 
(E.) The twist drill (Fig. 48, B) is a valu- 
able tool; every carpenter should own an 
assortment of twist drills for use in places 
where other bits may come in 
contact with iron. The sizes 
range from 3/5” to 3’’ by 32ds. 
The round shank drill may be purchased 
in any size up to 3” by 64ths of an inch. 
(F.) The extension bit (Fig. 44, A) is a 
very convenient tool for boring a hole of 
any size within certain limits, and is at 
times extremely valuable. 
(G.) The center bit (Fig. 44, B) is often 
used in boring holes through thin material 
which would be apt to be split if an auger 
bit were used.

ened, as the size of the bit will be reduced. In filing the 
cutter, be sure that its under side back of the cutting 
edge is filed enough 
to clear the wood 
after the cutter has 
entered it. 
In doing this, it 
should beremembered 
that the bit pro- 
gresses into the wood 
as it cuts, and unless 
the under side of the 
cutter is filed prop- 
erly, it will bear upon 
the wood beneath it, 
back of the cutting 
edge, and_ prevent 
the bit from advanc- 
ing. To remedy 
this, be sure that 
the cutter is kept filed thin, and that the under 
side is straight from the edge to the beginning of the 
twist. 
(I.) If the lips (Fig. 41, 6b) are filed off, an auger bit 
bores into the end wood easily. 
25. The bitbrace, or stock.— (A.) This tool is used 
to hold the bit, and to furnish sufficient leverage to turn 
the bit into the wood. Bitbraces are made of different 
sizes, and with different devices for holding the “tangs” of 
the bits. A workman should own an 8” and a 10” swing 
bitbrace, as it is often necessary to use different sizes, or 
kinds, of bits alternately.

(B.) The ratchet bitbrace (Fig. 46) differs from the 
ordinary brace only in the ratchet attachment. It is an 
indispensable tool to an up-to-date workman, as it may 
be used in many places 
where an ordinary brace 
would be useless; for gen- 
eral work, however, being 
heavier, it is less conven- 
ient than the plain brace. 
26. The screwdriver (A.) 
is one of the most important 
tools in a carpenter’s kit, and to be of use should be of 
finely tempered steel; for, if too soft, it will turn over, and 
if too hard, it will break. The edge should be as thick 
as the slot of a screw will allow, in order to have as much 
strength as possible. 
(B.) A round-handled screwdriver is not so. satis- 
factory as one with an elliptical or polygonal handle, 
as it is impossible to obtain as good a grip upon 
the former as upon the latter; a round handle, planed 
flat upon the two opposite sides, is quite commonly 
used. 
(C.) Ratchet screwdrivers are useful in many places where 
it is difficult to use two hands, and there are patent 
quick-action screwdrivers on the market which are suitable 
only for certain kinds of light work, as what is gained in 
speed is lost in power. The screwdriver bit is a short 
screwdriver blade, tanged to fit a bitbrace; it is essen- 
tial in doing economical work, as screws may be driven 
much more rapidly than by hand, and it is also valu- 
able on account of its greater leverage in driving heavy 
screws.

27. Compasses, or dividers (Fig. 47), are used to draw 
circles and curves, and for spacing and scribing, by which is 
meant the process of fitting 
a piece of wood to an uneven 
surface. Calipers (Fig. 48) 
are used to measure the out- 
side of a round or oval 
object. Those shown are 
known as “outside” cali- 
pers; “inside” calipers, or 
those used for measuring the 
inside of a hole, have straight 
legs. These tools ordinarily Fia. 47: Fa. 48. + CoMPassEs. CALIPERS. 
are not considered a part of 
a carpenter’s kit, as they are generally used upon work 
requiring more exact measurements. Woodworkers’ tools 
are graded to sizes, generally nothing finer than 16ths of 
an inch; hence, the ordinary 
methods of measuring will 
usually give sufficiently accu- 
rate results. 
28. Pliers.—(A.) These are 
indispensable little tools (Fig. 
49), and every workman 
should own a pair. Those 
combining several tools are 
\ most useful; cheap tools of 
Fie. 49. Fra. 50. this sort are usually worth- Primrs. NIpPERS. less. 
(B.) Nippers (Fig. 50) are made to cut wire, but not 
to pull nails. Being tempered for cutting, those of good 
quality are hard and brittle, lacking the toughness neces- 
   
-P-A-G-E-54
  40 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
sary to pull nails, for which work a cheap pair of nippers 
may be purchased. 
29. The scraper is one of the most useful tools in the 
kit of the carpenter who works upon hard wood. This 
tool may be purchased, or made of a very hard saw; it 
must be of hard, tough 
steel, or the edge will not 
last. A scraper should 
be about 3” x 5”, which 
is a convenient size for 
grasping with the hand. 
Many workmen make 
handles for their scrap- 
ers (Fig. 51, A and B), 
but cabinet makers, and 
others who use them con- 
tinually, generally prefer 
to use them without 
handles. If a large sur- 
face is to be scraped, it 
is well to have a handle 
of a leather palm (Fig. 
51, C). This is a piece of leather of suitable size and 
shape to protect the hand from the heat generated by the 
action of the scraper in cutting; the thumb is passed 
through the hole, and the broad part of the palm hangs 
between the scraper and the thick of the hand. For scrap- 
ing floors, a scraper plane (Fig. 51, D) will be found valu- 
able, though if much of this work is to be done, it will be 
the best economy to purchase one of the forms of floor- 
scraping machines. 
30. Edges. — There are two forms of edges used in

A, B, handles for scraper; C, leather palm; D, scraper plane,

  TOOLS 41 
sharpening scrapers,—the square and the beveled edge; 
in sharpening either of these, the edge should be filed, 
whetted, and turned with a burnisher. This 
imparts a wire edge, indicated in Fig. 52, A 
and B, which shows enlarged views of the two 
forms of edges of scrapers. If the eye glances 
along the edge of a properly sharpened 4 
scraper, the edge will appear slightly curved; ie. 52. — 
this edge must be given it by filing. After Ses 
the scraper is filed, each corner which is to 4, jevelea 
be turned must be whetted to a perfectly See 
keen edge upon an oilstone, as the object of 
sharpening a scraper is to “ turn”’ this edge at an angle 
with the sides of the scraper. 
By “ turning ” the edge of a scraper is meant pushing 
the particles of steel, which form the corner, over, so that 
they will form a wire edge which will stand at an angle with 
the sides of the scraper. When the edge has been skillfully 
turned, it will cut like a very finely sharpened 
and adjusted plane, and will work either with 
a or against the grain without tearing the wood. 
Notice carefully the angle of the burnisher

edge scraper; notice that the burnisher swings in an —

  42 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
angle of about 15°, one stroke only being made at each 
angle. 
At B, Fig. 55, is shown the method of turning the edge 
of a bevel edge scraper; the student will notice that the 
angles are similar to 
those shown at A, 
except that the first 
stroke is made at 
nearly the same angle 
as the bevel of the 
scraper. An _ edge 
may often be turned 
at one stroke, and 
more than three 
should rarely be nec- 
essary. If more than 
three are made, the 
edge may be turned 
too far, which is 
worse than not being 
turned enough. The 
Fie. 54.—Mernop or Grasping ScrAPER Be Ban CE strokes should be 
  made in the order 
indicated by the figures of the angles of the bur- 
nisher; otherwise it will be difficult to obtain satis- 
factory results. 
The amount of pressure necessary to apply at this 
stage of the work cannot be described, but can only be 
discovered by practice. A steady, moderate pressure is 
all that is needed, but care should be used that the 
angle of the burnisher does not change during the 
stroke. This will give an edge suitable for common
-P-A-G-E-57
  TOOLS 43 
counter, or table, tops, for hardwood floors, and similar 
work, if the skill to use the burnisher properly has 
been acquired. 
The burnisher should be slightly lubricated with oil, 
or with the end of the tongue, as this assists it to slide over 
the edge of the scraper without scratching. 
If a scraper is to be used upon very fine work, a different 
shaped edge should be made; it should be whetted to four 
perfectly square and keen corners, 
each of which ‘will furnish an edge. 
This is a more difficult method of 
sharpening a scraper, but it gives 
four edges suitable for fine work. 
The edge should be turned by carry- 
ing the burnisher as shown at A, Fig. 
55, making the strokes at the differ- 
ent angles in the order indicated by the numbers. In sharp- 
ening any scraper, care should be used that no strokes 
are made back of the square, as stroke bc of Fig. 56. 
Keep the burnisher pointing down all the time, as indi- 
eated at a, Fig. 53, as in this lies the chief difficulty. Two 
or three strokes should be sufficient to sharpen the 
scraper. 
To turn the edge of a scraper properly, a burnisher is 
necessary. This tool should be made of the hardest steel, 
and is often made by the workman himself from an old file, 
ground perfectly smooth and polished. Perhaps the most 
satisfactory burnisher within easy reach of the woodworker 
may be made from a nail set, which may be fitted to a 
handle and ground to an awl point. The back of a nar- 
row chisel or gouge may be used, though these are rather 
clumsy. The burnishers found in stores are generally

  44 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
of little value, as they are apt to be soft, and any steel 
which can be cut with a file is useless as a burnisher for 
sharpening scrapers, as the scraper will cut 
into it, instead of turning over. 
If satisfactory results are not obtained, 
there may be several causes: the scraper 
may not be of just the right temper or tex- 
ture; the burnisher may be soft or rough; 
the edge may not have been turned over 
Pree eatuces evenly, or it may have been turned over 
To Be Avoinen too far, as indicated in an exaggerated way 
RUSHARPENING at q, Fig. 56, which is the result of carrying 
the burnisher around too far, as shown by 
the line bc. This may be remedied by using the awl 
point as shown at d, Fig. 57, holding the scraper 
and burnisher in about the same relative positions as 
indicated, and guiding the burnisher by the thumb, which 
should be carried on the square edge of the scraper, 
moving with the burnisher its entire length. In this 
way the edge may be turned back to its correct angle, 
when a very light touch in the usual way will generally 
make the desired edge. 
If either the scraper or the burnisher is not 
of the right texture, throw it away, as it is 
worthless. If the burnisher is rough, it may j 
be made smooth upon an oilstone. If the edge Preview 
of the scraper is rough, it may be turned back Fis. 57. — 5 : TURNING

again, especially if the corner has been turned several 
times. 
Though it may seem from the above explanation of the 
methods of sharpening scrapers that it is a very complex 
operation, it will be 
seen that it is not a 
difficult matter, if it 
is once worked out. 
Usually it demands 
a little time and 
practice to acquire 
the knack that will 
make it possible to 
do the sharpening 
surely and well. 
In using a scraper, 
it may be grasped as 
shown in Figs. 58, 59,

work being done, and

wuen Worktne upon an Epar. with the grain. In 
using this tool, as in 
the use of most others, the easiest way generally is 
the most efficient. As the young workman gains ex- 
perience, he will gradually acquire the correct methods 
to use his tools for all the various purposes within their 
scope. 
31. Nail sets are for the purpose of ‘‘setting’” the 
nails, or for sinking them below the surface of the 
wood; and in order to stand the hard usage to which they 
are subjected, they must be very carefully tempered.
-P-A-G-E-61
  TOOLS 47 
The best form of nail set is that which has a cupped or 
hollow point, as it is not so apt to slip off of the head 
of the nail. 
32. Wrenches are of many kinds and patterns and of 
every conceivable use, but 
that known as the “ mon- 
key,” or ‘ Coe’s,” wrench 
(Fig. 61) is perhaps the most 
convenient for general work 
and has not been supplanted by any of more recent 
invention. 
33. Handscrews (A.), if of good material and well made, 
will stand any legitimate use, and if properly used and 
eared for, will last a lifetime. However, a novice or a 
careless workman often destroys them rapidly by allowing 
the jaws to be under strain while in the position shown in 
Fig. 62, which 
will probably 
break the middle 
screw, and_ per- 
haps both screws. 
(B.) In using 
handscrews for 
gluing, the jaws 
should be set to 
nearly the size 
of the material 
which is to be 
placed between 
them, before the glue is spread. In placing the hand- 
screws upon the work, the outside screw should be turned 
back so that it will not: prevent the jaws from being

slightly closer at the outside screw than at the points. 
By this method the strain which is applied in set- 
ting up the outside screw will bring the jaws parallel, 
which is the only position in which handscrews should 
be allowed to remain. 
In opening or clos- 
ing a handscrew, the 
middle screw should 
be held in the left 
hand, and the outside 
screw in the right, 
as in Fig. 63; the 
screws should then be 
grasped so that they 
will not turn in the 
hand and the hand- 
screw revolved in 
the desired direction. 
Never put unneces- 
sary strain upon 
handscrews, nor leave 
them with a heavy strain upon them for a very long 
time. : 
If the work is well fitted, no more strain should be used 
than is necessary to bring the joints well up, and no work 
should be glued unless the joints fit well. In any case, 
the outside screw should be turned back a quarter or a half 
a turn after the glue has set; this will relieve the strain, 
and add much to the life of the handscrew. 
In gluing work which requires several handscrews to 
hold it while the glue is setting, the handles of the outside 
screws all should point one way. This allows the work to 
  Fic. 63.— Correct Usr or THe HaNnpscrew.
-P-A-G-E-63
TOOLS 49 
be handled much more easily, as the handles of the middle 
screws will form an even bearing upon the floor. If this 
is not done, the outside screws are apt to be broken 
when a heavy piece of work is being glued and handled, 
since the weight of the work will rest upon the screws 
which bear upon the floor. 
(C.) Before using new handscrews, the screws should 
be treated with beeswax and beef tallow, or with black 
lead mixed with oil or with wax The latter compound 
is very dirty ; the former lubricates the screws perfectly. 
The screws should be heated, and the lubricant applied 
hot. 
34. (A.) A grindstone of good quality, from 20” to 26” 
in diameter, is indispensable to a woodworking shop, and 
should be used frequently, as the efficiency of cutting tools 
is much increased if they are kept well ground, and much 
time may be saved in whetting them. 
(B.) In selecting a grindstone, be sure that it is true 
and round, and of a coarse, even grit, which can be quite 
satisfactorily determined by examining several and select- 
ing the coarsest, as that will doubtlessly be a fast cutting 
stone. 
(C.) The stone should be carefully centered and 
mounted upon a frame. The face may be kept true by 
means of a file or other hard steel being held against it 
as it revolves, or a piece of 4” or ?” gas pipe revolved from - 
side to side of the stone as it is turned. Never allow a 
stone to rest with one side in the water, as it will be made 
softer and heavier upon that side, and soon worn out of 
true. 
(D.) Do not use one place upon the surface of the stone 
continually, as a groove will quickly be worn there; in-

stead, keep the tool moving from side to side, If properly 
eared for, a stone will hold its face indefinitely. 
35. Emery, corundum, carborundum, and other artificial 
abrasive wheels have in many cases supplanted the grind- 
stone, as they cut much more rapidly. Any one not 
accustomed to using them must be careful that the temper 
of the tool is not destroyed, as the wheel runs at a high 
rate of speed, and a tool in 
unskillful hands is easily 
burned. To avoid this, the 
tool should be held lightly 
but firmly against the stone, 
and frequently dipped in water to cool it. If an emery 
wheel burns badly, it may be because it needs dressing ; 
for this purpose a diamond emery wheel dresser is the 
best, but on account of its cost, various devices have 
been patented to accomplish the same result, one of which 
is illustrated in Fig. 64. 
36. Whetstones.—(A.) These are used to give to a tool 
the keen édge necessary to cut wood smoothly. The 
natural stone in most common use is the ‘‘ Washita stone,” 
which is quarried in the Ozark mountains, and is thought 
by many to be the best natural stone for the general use 
of the woodworker ; it is fast cutting, and when of the 
best quality is of even texture. 
(B.) Many workmen prefer an. ‘Arkansas stone,’ as 
it is finer and harder than the Washita. It is also 
more expensive, however, and is better adapted to the 
use of woodcarvers and engravers than to the use of 
woodworkers in general. It is usually not so fast eut- 
ting as the best of the Washita stones, but a finer edge 
may be obtained by its use. There are other natural

stones, but none so generally used as the above. The 
purchase of a natural stone is to a great extent a 
lottery, as only about one stone in ten has a perfectly 
even texture, is free from cracks, and has reasonably 
good cutting qualities. 
(C.) If a stone needs truing, lay a piece of coarse 
sandpaper upon a board, and rub the stone over it 
until it has been ground down. The best place, how- 
ever, to true up a whetstone is upon the horizontal 
stone of a marble worker; this is a large grindstone, 
several feet in diameter, mounted on a vertical shaft, 
upon which are placed pieces of marble to be ground to a 
flat surface. 
(D.) Artificial oilstones, made of emery, corundum, 
carborundum, and other artificial abrasives, are coming 
rapidly into use, and, as in the case of grindstones, even- 
tually will supplant all others in many occupations, as 
they cut faster than any natural stone, may be made of 
any degree of fineness, and are of absolutely even texture. 
They are also able to resist many accidents which would 
destroy a natural stone. ‘ 
(E.) Slip stones are used to sharpen gouges and curved 
tools of all kinds, and may be made in any desirable shape. 
An oblong stone, 8’’ x 2’” x 1”, is the size of stone in most 
general use by the woodworker, and should be fitted into 
a box or piece of wood with a cover to keep it clean. It 
may be laid either flat or on its edge, as suits the workman, 
though the stone may be kept true more easily if it is set 
on its edge. 
(F.) The use of the oilstone is described under topic 
14, A. The oil used should be a kind that. will not gum; 
its purpose is to prevent the glassiness which is caused by
-P-A-G-E-66
  52 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
the friction of the tool over the stone. Common machine 
oil is used by many, lard oil by others, while kerosene, or 
coal oil, is claimed by many workmen to be the only oil 
suitable for use upon an oilstone. Any one of these oils 
will give satisfactory results, but kerosene keeps the stone 
cleaner, thereby adding to its efficiency, and for this pur- 
pose lubricates quite as well as any of those above men- 
tioned. 
37. (A.) Files are used for many purposes by wood- 
workers. An assortment consisting of 4” and 6” slim taper, 
or three-cornered, files; 8’’ and 10” flat, or bastard, files ; 
8’, 10’, and 12” round files; and 8” and 12” half round 
wood files and rasps should be in every carpenter’s kit. 
The 4” slim taper files should be used upon the finer 
saws, and the 6” upon the coarser ones, though the latter 
are used!by some workmen for both saws. Upon job- 
bing work it is necessary to have a few warding and knife 
files to use upon keys and odd jobs, and also to sharpen 
bits. 
Files and rasps are made of every shape and size, and 
for every purpose. Wood files usually are tempered to 
stand lead or soft brass, and should never be used upon 
anything harder. 
In drawing a file back between the cuts, do not allow 
it to drag, as it is injured thereby about as much as when 
it is cutting. 
(B.) There are a great many other tools and appliances 
used by the woodworker with which the workman should 
be familiar, but it is not necessary to describe them, 
as the above-mentioned are the most essential tools 
common to all forms of woodworking. There is no im- 
portant principle involved in the construction, care, and
-P-A-G-E-67

use of woodworking tools which is not discussed in this 
chapter, and the student who becomes thoroughly familiar 
with the matter treated will have little trouble in learn- 
ing to handle other tools. 
38. Saw filing.—(A.) This is an aovomiplihment 
which every young woodworker should master, as its 
  Fig. 65.—Jorintine a Saw. 
possession will save expense and inconvenience, and add 
much to his efficiency as a workman. 
(B.) The first step in sharpening a saw is to examine 
the edge carefully to see if the teeth are of an even length ; 
if they are not, they should be jointed. This is done by 
using a flat file held perfectly square in a block, as shown in 
Fig. 65. One or two light strokes usually will be enough 
to make all the teeth of the same length. The edge of 
the saw should round slightly in the middle, say about 
} fora 24” ora 26” saw. If the edge is perfectly straight, 
it should not be jointed to this shape at once, but a little 
at each time for several filings. 
(C.) After jointing the saw, be sure that it is properly
-P-A-G-E-68
  54 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
set. This may be done by a saw set, of which there are 
several patterns in use; these are all of two types, the 
hand set (Fig. 66) and the 
anvil set (Fig. 67). Either of ° 
these forms is efficient, but 
as it is more convenient, the 
hand set is more commonly 
used. Do not give the saw 
too much set, as it will not 
cut smoothly, but will break the wood badly on the back 
side of the cut; there is also greater danger of breaking 
the teeth, and as more wood is cut out, more muscle must 
be applied. The point of the teeth only should be set, 
and care should be used that the blade of the saw is not 
sprung, which will be apt to result from setting the teeth 
too far from the point. 
A saw to be used upon green lumber should have 
coarser teeth and more set than one which is to be used 
upon thoroughly dry, seasoned wood. <A panel saw in- 
tended for use upon fine finishing work 
usually is ground so thin upon the 
back that it needs little or no set. 
Some workmen set a saw so heavily 
.that it will do for several filings; 
while this is satisfactory for a soft saw 
to be used upon common work, it is not 
a good plan to treat a fine, hard saw 
this way, though the latter may be touched up once or 
twice. 
(D.) In filing, it is important that the file should be 
carried at the same angle the entire length of both sides 
of the blade. For a cutting-off saw, the file should be

  Fic. 67.— Anvin Saw 
Ser,

  TOOLS 55 
carried at an angle with the side of the blade of from 60° 
for soft wood to 70° for hard wood, as shown in Fig. 68; 
and for general work, at an angle 
about halfway between the two. 
The file may be carried horizon- 
tally, as at aa, Fig. 69, which 
makes all the teeth of the same 
size; as at A, Fig. 70; or it may be 
carried as at bb, Fig. 69, which will 
make the teeth of the shape shown fie. 68.— Anctz oF THE Fite 
at; Hig. 70: “The third method: | ya ms ue: ov) 2xa 
is preferred by many workmen, as 
it allows the file to run more smoothly, thus lengthening 
its life a little. There is no difference in the efficiency of 
the saws filed by these methods, but if filed as at bb, Fig. 
69, it is more difficult to keep the teeth of the same size. 
and to make a good-looking job. 
In filing a cutting-off saw, the top of the file should be 
held more or less slantingly, as shown in Fig. 71, according 
to the hook which it is desired that 
—z = the teeth shall have. The more 
hook a saw has, the faster it will 
cut, but the cut will be rougher in 
proportion. Experience is necessary

File every tooth upon each side of the saw to a perfect 
point, one half of the filing being done from each side; file 
the entire length from one side, then reverse the saw and 
file from the other side. This cannot always be the exclu-    Softwood 1of Hardwood

may be necessary. The file should be carried with 
its point toward the point of the saw, filing the cut- 
ting or the front side of the tooth of the farther side of 
the saw, and the back of the tooth next ahead on the 
nearer side with the same stroke. If the point of the saw 
is carried toward the handle of the saw, it makes the teeth 
chatter, and upon a hard saw, may make them break. It 
also causes an excruciating noise, and shortens the life 
of a file, as the continuous " 
chatter against its teeth 
will soon break them and 
destroy the file.

CHAPTER II 
Workine Drawines 
39. Use and purpose of working drawings. — (A.) 
It is essential to the success of a workman of the present 
time that he should be able to read ordinary working 
drawings readily, and to take measurements from them 
intelligently. He should also understand the’ relation 
between the scaled drawing and the work that he is to 
produce from it. 
(B.) The difference between a photograph, or a per- 
spective view, and a working drawing, lies in the fact that 
the former shows the object approximately as it appears 
to the eye, and is an end in itself ; while a working drawing 
is made with but slight regard for artistic effect, and is 
simply a means to an end. In other words, the purpose of 
a working drawing is to convey to the mind of the work- 
man, in the plainest and simplest manner possible, the 
idea which is in the mind of the draftsman. 
40. Three-view drawing.— Any object to be drawn 
may be shown generally by three views; for instance, 
let us assume that the perspective sketch of the cross 
in Fig. 73 represents the idea, or the mental image, con- 
ceived in the mind of the draftsman, and of which he 
wishes to make a drawing as a means to the end of having 
the cross built. 
62
-P-A-G-E-77
  
WORKING DRAWINGS 63 
In his mind he takes a position directly in front of the 
cross, and imagines that every part of its face is at exactly 
right angles 
with a line from 
his eye. This

proceeds to 
draw the sketch

of the shading, suggesting conventionally the material of 
which the section actually consists, as in Fig. 77, in which 
is shown the character of the lines 
generally used to represent the vari- 
ous building materials. If the sec- 
tion is colored, woodwork is illus- 
trated by yellow; iron, by dark gray °‘

(B.) It frequently happens that 
a detail may be too large in one or

if the shape of the detail permits it,

common method of showing an

mensions are for the entire width,

the outside and the vertical section

Figure 82 shows the method 
of indicating the radii and

44. Notes and dimen- 
sions. —In studying plans, 
it is important that every 
reference and _ explanatory 
note should be read and care- 
fully considered; every line 
should be followed its entire 
length, as what may seem to 
be of little importance may 
be the key to a knotty ques- 
tion. In using plans, the 
workman should invariably 
foliow the figures or dimen-

Secrion. Vinw AND 
upon scaling, because a mis-
-P-A-G-E-83
  WORKING DRAWINGS 69 
take may have been made in the drawing, or a change 
made after the drawing was finished. In such cases the 
draftsman would not change 
the drawing, but would simply 
alter the figures, knowing that 
the workman will follow the 
figures instead of scaling the 
drawing. If drawings are 
properly made, every essential 
dimension is plainly noted. 
Instead of using the words 
feet and inches, or their ab- 
  Sts . -, .  Fia. 82.—Mernop or Inpicatina 
breviations, ft. and in., it is prema Coane 
the usual custom to make the 
symbol (’) for feet and (’’) for inches; therefore, in- 
stead of writing 6 ft. 93 in., it would generally be 
expressed, 6’ 94/”. 
45. Using the scale. — In using a scale, the workman 
must learn to think in feet and inches. It is a great tempta- 
tion to the novice, because it seems the easiest way, to 
reduce the desired measurements of feet and inches to 
inches and fractions of an inch. For instance, if in work- 
ing with a three quarter inch scale, or }/’=1’ 0”, the 
desired dimension is 6’ 8’’, the easiest way seems to be to 
reduce it to standard inches, and to say five inches. 
This is wrong; for, when working with an intricate frac- 
tion, or an unusual scale, say, 1/’°=1’ 0”, it will be hard 
to measure or reduce it to a workable fraction if using 
an ordinary rule. 
The 1” and the 3” scales are awkward, as the ordinary 
rule is divided into sixteenths of an inch, and therefore 
hard to adapt to measuring twelfths of a foot; thus the 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  70 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
scales most generally used are those which are adaptable 
to a sixteenth of an inch, for instance, the 1’, }’, }”, 12”, 
and 3”’ scales. 
In a %” scale, 7¢’"=6”. This scale is adapted only to 
work upon large buildings, and is the smallest which the 
average woodworker is likely to use, though on large, gen- 
eral, or assembled drawings of a group of buildings, the 3%” 
or 7s” scales are sometimes preferred. The 35” souls is 
occasionally used, in which 7¢’’=4”. The }” ‘eile is the 
usual scale for east and picditahesieed yusleings in draw- 
- ing the floor plans and elevations. In this scale, 35’"=3”. 
The ?” scale is frequently used in showing detaila and 
sesGoria of construction. These are often placed upon 
the same sheet of drawings as the smaller drawing that 
they are to explain, references being made between them 
either by letters or figures. In this scale, 75’/’=1”. 
The 13” scale is used for the same purpose as the 3” 
scale, and this, or any large scale, may be used for 
making drawings of furniture and other fittings. In this 
scale, }/’ = 1". The 3’ scale is used for the same purpose 
as is the j ?’’ and the 1)’; but, being larger, it allows more 
accurate Adiwicg and sealing. In this scale, }/” = 1”. 
Full-sized drawings are usually made of important details. 
Figure 83, A, shows a part of a 4’ scale, and B, a part of 
a }’’ scale. The distance indicated at A is 4’ 5’; and at B, 
it is 2’ 9’. In using a scale to measure an union 
distance from a drawing, —for instance, either of the 
above spaces, — place the graduation 0 on the line at one 
side of the space, as atc; then move the scale to the near- 
est smaller graduation of feet at the other extreme of the 
distance to be measured, as at d. In measuring the dis- 
tance at A, move the scale to the right, and at B, to the
-P-A-G-E-85
  
WORKING DRAWINGS 71 
left, a distance equal to that between d and the smaller 
graduation of feet; then read the feet and inches as 
shown upon the scale. 
In using an-ordinary rule as a scale, the workman will 
find it more convenient to use the edge which is divided

for this purpose, it is tipped upon its edge to bring the 
graduations nearer the work, and the end of the rule is 
placed upon the line at one end of the space being measured.

8x4=8'; #3 = 2 of 1’=9”; thus we obtain 8’ 9”. In 
ie with a ?’’ scale, by applying the same mental 
process, we obtain 2’11”. If a 13’ scale is being used, 
it will read 1’ 53”. The rule commonly used by most

woodworkers is adaptable for scaling by the above 
method, but a brass-bound rule, which is generally scaled, 
or some other form of a scaled rule, is preferred by 
Rf many. 
46. Drawing tools. (A.) The board equipment. —In 
making a working drawing, the student should have a 
drawing board (Fig. 85, a),a T square (b), and also a 45° 
triangle (c), a 30° and 60° triangle (d), and thumb tacks 
(f). (See also Figs. 163 and 164.) 
Besides the above tools, there should be an architect’s 
triangular scale, pencils, erasers, both hard and soft, and 
a set of drawing instruments, which may be as simple 
or as elaborate as desired. A medium-priced set, con- 
taining the compass with pen and pencil points, divider, 
ruling pen (if ink work is to be done), and one or more of 
the spring bow instruments, will be found serviceable 
and convenient, though the latter instruments may be 
omitted if desired, as they are necessary only upon small 
details where accuracy is required. It is false economy 
to purchase the cheapest set possible, as satisfactory 
results cannot be obtained by their use; on account of 
the poor material of which they are made, repeated ad- 
justments will quickly strip the screw threads. A ruling 
pen with either a wood or a metal handle will be found 
more serviceable than one of bone, as the latter will 
break easily. 
(B.) In ordinary architectural drawing, and in the 
drawing connected with this series, by far the larger part 
of the work will require only the board equipment ; there- 
fore, on account of the space required, special instructions 
in the use of the instruments will be omitted. The writer 
has observed that the average student will master the use  
-P-A-G-E-87
    wl, 
WORKING DRAWINGS 73 
of the instruments in less time than is required for him 
to attain a moderate facility in the use of the board 
equipment. 
In using the board tools, the head of the T square 
should invariably be kept upon the left of the board, 
as in Fig. 85; it may be moved from top to bottom of 
the board to allow horizontal, parallel lines to be made 
at any point upon the paper, as indicated by lines m m. 
  
  
  
  
          
Fic. 85.— Drawine Boarp, T Square, AND TRIANGLES. 
  Vertical lines (n n), or lines at an angle of 90° with the T 
square, should be made by the triangles, but if these are 
not large enough to allow the required line to be made, 
the T square’ may be used. Lines at an angle of 30° or 
60° with the T square, as at o and p, should be made by 
the 30° and 60° triangle, resting upon the T square as 
indicated. Lines at an angle of 45° should be made by 
the 45° triangle, as at s. The 15° and 75° lines may 
be made by placing the triangles as shown at ¢; in fact, N 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
74 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
any degree divisible by 15 may be drawn by the manipu- 
lation of the triangles from the T square in its horizontal 
position. 
To make parallel lines in any part of the paper, which 
cannot be made by either of the triangles resting upon 
the T square in its horizontal position, place the T square 
at any angle that will allow the triangles to rest upon 
its edge and coincide with the desired angle. 
The paper should be placed square with the left end 
of the board, as shown. The pencils should always be 
kept sharp, and in drawing horizontal lines should be 
used only upon the top edge of the T square and upon 
the edges of the triangles, not against the edge of the rule. 
The latter should be used only for measuring; if used for 
guiding the pencil, the graduations will soon become so 
indistinct that it will be difficult to read them. 
In making the drawings necessary in working out the 
exercises of the following chapters, the principles ex- 
plained in Topics 39 to 43 should be reviewed and applied.

  CHAPTER III 
ConstrucTIVE EXERCISES 
47. Object of exercises. — The tool exercises of this 
chapter are not intended to be performed one after the 
other, though a certain amount of this work is valuable 
in forming correct habits in the use of tools before really 
important work is undertaken. A sufficient number of 
these exercises should be worked out to familiarize the 
student with the constructive details of the supplementary 
models which form the actual course of work. They are 
also intended to inform the student of the important forms 
and uses of the different types of joints which are the 
basis of all construction in wood. 
Many of the exercises are shown in tsometric projection, 
and are planned to serve only as a basis from which work- 
ing, or scaled, drawings may be made by each student, 
before the actual work is begun. 
48. Use of exercises. — Before beginning a piece of 
work, the student should read the text and the references, 
and should understand every step necessary to complete 
the model. It will be noticed that the sequence of ex- 
ercises has been carefully worked out in connection with 
some of the models which include unusual or difficult 
features. Where this has been done, the progression 
should be followed carefully, as otherwise troublesome 
conditions may develop as the work progresses. 
76
-P-A-G-E-91
CONSTRUCTIVE EXERCISES M 
When a tool is used for the first time, the directions for 
its use should be carefully studied, and correct methods 
followed from the first. 
49. Wood for exercises.—(A.) The following ex- 
ercises may be made of any soft, easily worked wood. 
White pine is the most desirable in localities where it is 
not too expensive; poplar, or whitewood, as it is called 
in many sections of the country, bass wood, and white 
walnut, the latter often known as butternut, are also 
very satisfactory woods for practice. 
In general, it is not good practice to cut the pieces to their 
exact length until after the joint, or one end, has been fitted, 
as any deviation from absolute accuracy may make it 
impossible to work to the required dimensions, and the 
‘fraction of an inch of wood left for ‘‘ working,’’ will often 
save wasting all the material and a great deal of time. 
(B.) General directions. — All exercises may be glued 
together after the joint is made, if desired; but it is not 
necessary, as the pieces may be marked so that they can 
be laid together as they were fitted. 
It is of the utmost importance that neither files, rasps, 
nor sandpaper be used in making the joints included in 
the exercises of this chapter, as the student should depend 
entirely upon his cutting tools in fitting of all kinds. A 
file, or sandpaper, will invariably destroy a joint instead 
of improving it. ; 
The face sides of models, which are held together by 
their construction, should not be smoothed or sand- 
papered separately, but after they are in their places. 
In every case where it is possible, all of the marking, 
or laying out, should be done for the entire model before 
a cut is made upon any piece.

about #” wider than 
desired. 
B. Use of the ripsaw: Saw to above line. See Topic 11 D. 
C. Use of the cutting-off saw: Cut the piece off about 3’ longer

D. Marking the face side: Mark the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, upon the 
best, or face, side of the piece, as in Fig. 86, the face edge, or best 
edge, being marked “ 1.” 
E. Planing edge straight: Straighten edge 1. Plane straight and

. F. Testing an edge: 
Prove that the edge is 
straight by sighting along 
it, and then use a straight- 
edge to see whether or 
not the eye is true. All 
edges should be tested 
in this way until the eye 
is trained to know when 
an edge or surface is true.

as the eye should be trained to perform this work without depending 
upon artificial means. 
G. Square end 2; cut in the bench hook, as in Fig. 88. Use the

J. Use of gauge: Gauge to width. See Topic 7, Fig. 11. Work- 
ing from edge 1, make a line exactly 1?” from that edge. Before doing 
this it will be wise to practice upon a waste piece, until the tool is well 
under control. 
K. Planing a parallel edge: With a jack plane, plane edge 4 ex- 
actly to the gauge mark, when it should be parallel with edge 1, and 
square with the face side. 
The foregoing is, in general, the method which should be followed in 
making any piece square. 
L. Planing to thickness: Using the gauge as above described, 
make a line upon the edge of the piece entirely around it, and }”

from the face side. Plane to this line, and, if working against an 
iron bench dog, guard against bruising the end of the straightedge 
by placing a waste piece between it and the dog. Do not hold the 
piece in the vise, as a piece so thin will be sprung out of shape by the 
pressure. 
M. Working from the face side or edge: It is an almost invariable 
rule in carpentry to work from one side or edge, generally the best, 
which is known as the face side or edge, and from which everything is 
worked, measured, or squared. The student should never lose sight of

workman.

A. Laying out grooves: 1. Mark the grooves with a knife, try- 
square, and bevel; make the marks upon the face side at angles simi- 
lar to those shown in Fig. 89. 
2. From each of the lines above described, with a knife and try- 
square, make distinct. marks or cuts upon the edge, a little less than 
one half of the thickness of the piece, measuring by the eye. 
3. Gauge very lightly upon both edges, 1s’’ from the face side be-

which are to be cut. In using the gauge, be careful not to run over the 
spaces which will be cut out by the grooves, as the scratches will be a 
blemish upon the finished work.

below the gauge marks upon the edges, or allowing the chisel to 
follow the grain deeper than is desired. Make light cuts; do not 
try to take the wood all out at once by using a mallet to force the 
chisel, but be sure that the chisel is perfectly sharpened, and work 
slowly and carefully. The best results may be obtained by using 
the tool as shown in Fig. 90, the beveled side up, as the left hand, 
holding the chisel, will be an efficient guide and check upon its 
slipping.

52. Square butt joint. Fig. 91. 
Material: 1 piece, a, 6’’x 14" x". 
1 piece, b, 44” x14” x #”. 
A. Fitting the joint: Preferably holding the work as shown in 
Fig. 34, saw the joint with the backsaw, and block plane it to a 
perfect fit. Work carefully to 
a knife mark, and test the work 
continuously with a try-square to 
maintain accuracy with both face 
ie . side and edge. 
B. Marking with a knife: If 
accurate work is desired, never 
work to a pencil mark, as it is not 
possible to work as closely to a pencil line as to a distinct cut made 
with a sharp knife, which gives a definite line by which the joint may 
be made. If the work requires that a chisel should be used, as in 
cutting a shoulder, the knife cut makes a definite line in which the 
edge of the chisel may be placed. Upon this particular piece of 
work, however, the chisel will not be used ; but the definite knife 
mark will make possible more accurate sawing, and then all that is 
necessary to finish the joint is to block plane to the sharp edge 
indicated by the knife cut. 
C. Cutting to length: After a and 6 are fitted at a right angle, cut 
off the unfinished end of piece b, block plane it, and make it square with 
the faces. 
To repeat and emphasize a previous statement, the student should 
learn as early as possible in his work to look ahead to see which pieces 
should be cut to a neat length, and which pieces should be left long 
to allow for working. The following is a good general rule to apply to 
all work, — never cut to a neat length if it can be avoided. Like nearly 
every other rule, this will demand judgment in its application, or the 
endeavor to follow it may result in working to a disadvantage. How- 
ever, it should always be kept in mind when cutting the stock for a piece 
of work. 
The square butt joint is one of the most common forms of 
construction, as it is the type of joint used where two pieces are 
butted together at any angle, as outside and inside finish, plain 
boxes, ete. Fic. 91.— Square Burr Jornt.

Fitting the joint: Fit these pieces to each other, end to end, the 
process of fitting being thesameas — Sat ies 
in the preceding problem. i 
The work should be done so ac- 
curately that, when it is finished, the : 
face edges and the sides of the | 
pieces will form a perfectly straight 
line with each other. This joint 
is used where two pieces are butted together, as in lengthening flooring, 
siding, ete. 
54. Edge joint. Fig. 93. 
Material: 2 pieces, 12x 13""x }”. 
Neither piece should be cut to length nor planed to width until 
the exercise is completed, when it should be treated as one piece. 
A. Fitting the edges: Method 1. One edge of each piece should be 
made perfectly square, by using the jack plane as shown in Fig. 31, and 
these edges fitted to each other so that the ends will bear a very little 
harder than the middle, the difference being so slight that the eye cannot 
detect it. This does not mean that the pieces should be jointed hollow- 
ing, as they should be made as nearly perfectly straight as possible. 
In doing this work, the plane should be in first-class condition, 
and the finest possible shaving taken off in finishing the joint. This 
slight difference in

X) |; joint is to allow a 
ct * certain amount of 
| |i shrinkage to take 
place at the ends 
before the joint will 
open, as the ends of a board are more quickly affected by temperature 
and humidity than is the middle. 
B. Reénforced edge joints: This joint is used for table tops and for 
wide boards, and if reénforeement is necessary, the joint should be 
matched, tongued, and grooved, or doweled, as in Fig. 94,abc¢. It 
is also used on square-edged floors; matched flooring and beaded 
ceiling are elaborations of the same joint, not entirely for the purpose Fig. 93.—Eper Jornt: Meruop 1. 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  84 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
of reénforcement, but mainly to allow of blind nailing, as in Fig. 14, 
and to minimize the effect of shrinking and warping, as the tongue 
prevents an open joint between adjoining pieces, and keeps the face 
sides flush with each other. In beaded ceiling, indicated by the 
dotted line at h, the bead hides the joint if shrinking or warping occurs. 
C. Gluing the joint: Be sure that the joint is perfectly fitted before 
the glue is applied, and do not depend upon the clamps to bring the joint 
together. Any glue joint should be 
made wood to wood, or the glue is 
worthless, and if the joint does not 
fit perfectly, it will always be weak 
and apt to give way when shrinking 
or swelling takes place, or from a 
sudden blow. (See H below.) 
A wide miter joint may be 
tongued and grooved as at d, Fig. 94. 
In a case of this sort, the length of 
the tongue, or its grain, is at right 
angles with the face of the joint, so 
as to give all the strength possible 
to resist the tendency of the joint to 
open. The joint may be held in place 
by handscrews until the glue sets, as 
described in Topic 70. It is impor-

grooved panel work. and one in which the grain is parallel 
with the face of the joint, as at b. 
A cheap grade of panel work is sometimes made by the use of a 
tongue as shown at ¢, Fig. 94. 
D. Jointing wide boards: In general, the face side of the work 
should at all times be kept toward the workman, and especially is this 
true in making a glue joint. The joint should be made so that the 
faces of adjacent boards will be as nearly as possible in line with each 
other. This will be difficult if the boards are warped or twisted, though 
the worst of them may be ripped through the middle, and the inaccu- 
racies of one piece used to compensate those of the boards against   
  
  
    
  
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  CONSTRUCTIVE EXERCISES 85 
which it is fitted. This requires more work, but if a poor grade of 
stock is being used, a much better job may be done. 
E. Fitting the edge joint: Method 2. Some workmen joint the edges 
of the two members of a joint at the same time, as in Fig. 95. It 
requires skill to do this well, 
and it is necessary that the 
plane iron should be nearly 
straight on the edge, and care- 
fully sharpened and adjusted. 
By this method, if the face 
sides are opposite each other 
while the joint is being made, 
as indicated, and if the work 
is accurately done, the joint 
will be a perfect fit when the pieces are brought into their proper 
relation. 
F. Fitting the edge joint: Method 3. In making a glue joint less than 
four feet long, many workmen do not fit the edges by means of a try- Face sides 
    Ns

square, as it may be done more economically by the “ try” method, 
if the workman has sufficient skill. 
1. Mark the face corners as at ¢, d, of pieces a, b, Fig. 96, which is 
the usual face mark, and is so understood by other workmen. (This 
mark will hereafter be used to designate the face side and edge where 
necessary. ) 
2. Joint the edge of piece a by simply planing it straight, not using 
the try-square, but depending upon the “ feel ” of the wrist to make the   
 
-P-A-G-E-100

edge approximately square. (The student may use the try-square 
until he has acquired the “ feel.”’) 
3. Remove piece a from the vise, turn it ‘‘ end for end,” or reverse 
the ends, and lay it upon the bench with the face corner, ¢, in position,

Seconp Piece. 
as shown in Fig. 97. Place piece 6 in the vise, with the face corner, d, 
up, and toward the workman, as indicated. 
4. Joint the edge approximately straight, and square by the same 
method used in jointing piece a. 
5. Place piece a upon d, as in Fig. 96; and apply the try-square as in 
Fig. 98, to see whether or not the faces of the two boards are straight 
or fair with each other. If they are not, edge d of b may be jointed to 
bring both pieces in their desired relation. 
6. Unless both pieces are perfectly fair and “ out of wind” (i as in 
kind), that is, unless they will lay perfectly flat upon a true surface, it is 
impossible to make a joint which will stand this test of the try-square ; 
and by this method, if the boards are a little winding or twisted, as they 
are very apt to be, they may be averaged to make the finished board 
more nearly true than would be practicable if its accuracy depended 
upon a try-square. 
7. In testing the two members of a joint for accuracy, place their 
edges together with nothing to hold them, as shown in Fig. 99, and 
move piece a back and forth a little, sideways; if there is a lump 
upon either edge, a will swing upon it as upon a pivot, as at k. The 
same test should be applied from each end, and the defect carefully 
remedied. 
8. To obtain the best results in gluing up a wide board, the 
center of the joint should be a very little open, as explained in A of

this exercise. If this is well done, a short board may be glued up 
with but one clamp to hold it together, instead of with three or four 
clamps, which would be necessary if the joint were made perfectly 
straight. 
G. Rub joint: Method 4. This joint, which is sometimes used in 
gluing up wide boards, is made by fitting two edges together, so that 
they will bear equally their entire length. The glue is then put on 
and the pieces rubbed back and forth endways until the glue is well 
rubbed out of the side of the joint or into the wood. In doing this, 
care should be taken that the sides of the boards are kept flush ; there- 
fore this form of joint can be used only with perfectly straight 
stock. After the joint is made, the board should be set away until 
the glue is thoroughly hardened, until which time the board should be 
handled very carefully, as a sudden jar or blow may break the joint. 
If well made, this joint is as strong as any unreénforced square-edged 
joint. 
H. Gluing: In all glue joints, except the rub joint, the pieces should 
be fitted and held wood to wood with clamps, or hand screws, until the 
glue sets. The glue should all be squeezed out, as there is very little 
strength in a joint which shows a fine line of glue. 
To repeat and emphasize B, it is the glue which enters the pores of 
the wood of each member of the joint that gives the joint its strength, 
and if the joint is not perfectly fitted, a quick rap or exposure to a sud- 
den change in temperature is liable to break it open. 
I. Preparation for smoothing: After the glue is set, which will 
take at least three hours for hot glue, or twelve hours for cold glue, the 
superfluous glue upon the surface of the board should be cleaned off, 
and the board trimmed to the required size when it is ready for smooth- 
ing. For smoothing a surface, see Topic 17. 
J. Sandpapering: In making ready for the sandpaper, do not de- 
pend upon the sandpaper to make the work smooth, as it is easy to 
scour a hole in the surface. Although this may seem of no importance, 
when the finish is spread, it may be very prominent, and will always 
stand as an evidence of unskillful work. The smoothing plane and the 
scraper are the tools which should do this part of the work. For the 
use of the latter tool, see Topics 29 and 30. 
Tn using sandpaper, a sheet should usually be torn in halves the short 
way of the paper; if it is to be used upon a flat surface, one half should
-P-A-G-E-103
CONSTRUCTIVE EXERCISES 89 
be folded back to back, and held, not tacked, around a block about 
3” x 4’ x }” with the hand, as in Fig. 100. 
The act of grasping the block with sufficient force to hold it while at 
work will keep the sandpaper in its place. The use of any device to 
fasten it there is an unmistakable mark of the novice, as the workman 
realizes that his time is too valuable to spend upon anything so useless 
as tacking a piece of sandpaper to a block or using any of the devices 
  Fig. 100.— Meruop or Graspinc SANDPAPER. 
that some amateurs consider an advantage. A sandpaper block should 
always be used upon a flat surface, and the smaller the surface, the more 
need there is of a block. 
If there is much sanding of moldings to be done, it is best to make 
blocks to fit their curves, as it is hard upon the hands to do this work 
very long at a time, though nothing has ever been devised which fits 
irregular forms as well as the fingers. Never use sandpaper upon a 
piece of wood until all of the cutting upon it with edge tools has been done, 
as the particles of sand will enter the grain, and any edge tools used 
upon it afterwards will be dulled quickly. 
1. In using sandpaper, the workman should guard against rounding 
square corners or destroying the form of curved or flat surfaces, a raw 
corner, however, should always be removed with a few light, careful 
strokes, as otherwise, if it is square, it will be more or less ragged. 
When this is well done, it is one of the evidences of skillful workman- 
ship,  
-P-A-G-E-104
90 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
2. Do not use a piece of sandpaper so large as to prevent any 
part of it from being under perfect control, for the loose ends will 
scratch the wood, and it has an awkward and unworkmanlike appear- 
ance. ; 
3. Always work parallel with the grain, and be sure that all plane 
marks and uneven places are well rubbed down. In order to do this, it 
is often necessary to use considerable muscle. This part of the work 
requires good judgment, for unless sandpapered thoroughly, there are 
apt to be places which will show when the finish is spread on the work, 
though they may have been invisible before. No one can tell as well 
as the workman himself when he has sandpapered enough, though it 
may be evident to any one if it has been done injudiciously, and one or 
two careless strokes may destroy an otherwise good job. 
Upon a coarse job it is usually allowable, and sometimes desirable, 
to sandpaper across the grain, especially if the work is to be painted. 
Too much care cannot be taken in the use of sandpaper, especially upon 
the part of the amateur, for he is more liable to injure his work than to 
improve it.

ure with a rule in a case of this 
sort, if it is possible to measure 
with. the piece of wood itself. 
2. Connect points c and d 
across the face of each piece by 
a distinct knife mark, which will

case it is keyed and strapped in order to secure the greatest strength 
and rigidity. 
58. Mitered joint. Fig. 105. 
Material: 2 pieces, 6’ x 14” x ¥’. 
A. Uses of the mitered joint: The term miter is usually applied 
to the angle of 45°, by which a right angle is joined together, but any 
angle may have its miter. It 
is one of the most common 
joints, and is used in making 
picture frames, and in fitting 
door and window casings, base 
moldings, ete. It takes the a 
place of the square butt joint Se 
upon plain wood in many Fic. 105. Raden Tobie: 
places where it would be ob- 
jectionable for the end wood to show. The intersection joint is an 
adaptation of this joint. 
B. The miter box: In cutting a miter, it is customary to use a 
miter box. The form of miter box shown in Fig. 106 is one.of a number 
of patented, adjustable, iron m boxes upon the market, one of 
which is usually owned by every carpenter who works upon the bench 
or inside finishing. (In purchasing a tool of this sort, the longest saw 
possible should be selected.) 
1. Place the molding in the box, as indicated. 
2. After the ends of the pieces which form the joint are sawed, fit 
them together with a block plane, If the pieces are for outside work, 
           
-P-A-G-E-107

Fic. 106.— Iron Mirer Box wir Pisce 1n Piace Reapy ror Sawine. 
an accurate saw cut is generally sufficient, but if the saw has not made 
the miter a good fit, or if the mitered angle is not exactly true, the 
block plane must be used. 
'C. Nailing a mitered joint: In nailing a mitered joint (as in a 
picture frame), bore holes for the nails in pieces c, and place 6 in the

vise as indicated. The pieces should be held as shown in Fig. 107, A, 
piece c¢ projecting beyond piece d about 4’, as at c, so that when 
the nails are driven home they will force the members of the moldings 
to coincide, as at @ in Fig. 107 B. 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  94. ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
Glue should always be used if the best results are desired. 
After the nails have been driven as indicated, piece ¢ may be placed 
in the vise, and holes bored and nails driven through d, if the greatest 
strength is desired; this is not advisable upon ordinary work, however, 
and should be done only upon large moldings, on account of the danger 
of splitting the wood, and of 
nailing the joint open unless the 
nails are driven very skillfully, 
since they pull against each 
other. 
Notice that the nails are 
pointed a very little outside of 
square with the edge of piece c. A little practice will convince the 
workman that driving nails at about this angle will give better results 
than if the nails are driven square, or at a greater angle, as the 
tendency to slide, or drive open, is thereby lessened. 
A wooden miter box is preferred by many workmen in finishing 
down the outside of a house. (See Topic 71.) 
D. Marking a miter with the bevel: If it is desired, the student 
may, in this exercise, lay out the angle of the miter by using a bevel 
for the face, and the try-square to mark across the edge; or, in place 
of the bevel, he may use the 
miter square, a tool made the 
same as a try-square, except 
‘that the blade is set at an 
angle of 45° with the beam. 
If the bevel is used, the angle 
of 45° may be found by the 
method indicated in Fig. 9. 
59. Halved scarfed joint. Fig. 109.

A. Fitting the joint: This joint is sometimes 
used when it is necessary to join two timbers 
lengthwise. If used as a girder, there should 
be a support under the joint at d. This form of construction is 
sometimes fastened together by the same methods as shown in Fig. 
103. 
1. Lay off the shoulders of the joint, say 2”, by a distinct knife

mark upon the face, or top 
edge, of piece a, at c, and 
upon the back, or bottom 
side, of piece b, at d. 
2. Square from these 
marks, with a knife, a little 
less than half of the thick- 
ness of the piece upon each 
edge. 
3. Set the gauge to the 
distance e, which should 
equal half of the thickness 
of each piece, and mark 
plainly from the face side 
upon the two edges and 
across the end of each piece. 
B. Cutting to a-knife mark with a saw: With a backsaw, cut to 
the gauge mark from the face of a and the back of 6. Place the 
pieces one at a time in the vise, and with the backsaw cut out the recess 
between c and d, and their respective ends, which will allow the pieces 
to come together. If this is done with sufficient accuracy, the faces 
will fit and be flush (even). The saw cut should be made with such 
accuracy, that one half of 
the knife and gauge marks 
will be left wpon each of 
the two pieces that are to 
form the joint, in which 
case, all that will be nec- 
essary to make a perfect 
fit will be to trim the 
joint a very little with a 
sharp chisel. 
C. Fitting with a chisel: 
If any fitting of the

not do it by guesswork, but

exact place required to make a perfect fit. In trimming to this mark, 
" grasp the chisel as shown in Fig. 110, not as in Fig. 111,.which is 
extremely awkward and inefficient. If the chisel is used as in Fig. 110, 
  Fic. 112.—Incorrect Use or Tae Cuisen In Fottowine A Line. 
very little strength is necessary, as the pressure of the shoulder does 
the cutting. 
In fitting a joint of this sort, it is best to “cut under ’’; that is, to 
cut the wood inside of the visible part of the joint a very little back of 
the line, so that nothing will prevent the joint from coming together. 
Never try to follow a line by using the chisel as in Fig. 112, as the 
chisel is apt to run into the shoulder beyond the line, its bevel giving 
it a tendency to “ lead ” back of the knife mark which indicates the 
shoulder, thus destroying the joint. The visible portion of any joint 
should be as nearly perfect as possible; therefore in this case, the 
longitudinal portion should be perfectly straight, or slightly hollowing. 
Glue the pieces together, using hand screws to hold them in place 
each way. Cut the model to desired length, and smooth and sand- 
paper.

  CONSTRUCTIVE EXERCISES 97 
This form of scarfed joint is used for the same purpose as that de- 
scribed in Topic 59, but it has a greater shearing resistance, or a greater 
resistance to pressure “4 
from above. It is ob- 
vious that the pieces 
must be securely bol- 
ted, keyed, or strapped, 
unless the ends are 
secured so that there cannot possibly be any slipping endways. 
Fitting the joint: In laying out this joint, use a-knife and try- 
square; the distance from the face edge at a should be 3”, and that 
at the other end of the cut should be 1,4/’.. This latter mark should 
be made only from 1,°s’’ from the face corner, indicated by c, to the 
lower edge of each piece, since, if a knife -mark were made across the 
side, it would remain a blemish upon the finished model, as it is diffi- 
cult to smooth out a knife mark. These marks, which indicate the 
lines a a, should be made upon both sides of each piece. With a gauge, 
working from the face edge, which is marked with the face marks, c, 
lay off the distances #5’’ and 1,;’’ by points, not by scratches, as the 
latter might make a blemish. Join these points with a knife mark ; cut 
and fit as in Topic 59. Fasten together and finish, as in the preceding 
exercise.

In this and the following exercises, be sure that every cut is laid out 
correctly before any cutting begins. 
1. In making this joint, lay off with a distinct knife mark by a 
try-square, as in Fig. 6, the distance of the lock end, say }’’, upon the 
face side of piece a and upon the back side of piece 6. 
2. It is important that the size of the cut should not be measured from 
these cuts by a rule, but by the pieces themselves. 
As the face sides of pieces a and b should be flush when the model 
is finished, it is plain that the width of piece 6 on its face side at the 
joint must be cut out of the face side of piece a; likewise, the width 
of the back side of piece a must be cut out of the back side of 
piece b. 
3. Hence, turn piece b over so that the edge c of its face side will rest 
exactly over the knife mark-d of piece a of Fig. 115. 
  Fig. 115.—Layrine Our tae Curs or raz Norcuep, or Locxen, Jornt. 
4. With the point of a sharp knife, make a mark at e on piece a 
close to the edge of piece 6. If made accurately, this will give the exact 
width of the cut. Using the try-square, make a distinct knife mark 
a little inside of e, not a measurable distance, but enough to insure a 
close fit. 
5. Repeat the process to obtain the exact dimensions of the cut 
upon the back side of b, laying the pieces back to back instead of face 
to face. 
6. From these knife marks, proceed as in 51, A, 2.

8. If the joint is too close, remedy it by using the chisel as shown in 
Fig. 110. 
Before the joint is glued together, sandpaper the edges of the pieces; 
be careful not to touch the joint, however, as this may easily be made 
too small. 
B. Smoothing surfaces which join at an angle: After the jomt is 
fitted, the pieces glued together, and the glue set, smooth the face and 
back sides with a smoothing plane, being careful that the plane is in 
the best possible condition; also be sure that no cut is made directly 
across the grain ; otherwise, a piece is apt to be chipped off. Plane with 
the grain if possible, but if it is necessary to plane across the joint, do 
so at an angle of about 45°, and use care that the plane cuts in the 
direction of the grain most favorable for smooth work. 
If the lock end is left off, we have a halved joint, sometimes erro- 
neously called a lap joint, which is used in the construction of frame 
buildings in fastening the plates and sills at the corners, as in Fig. 99. 
The lock joint should be fitted so closely that glue is unnecessary, but 
it may be glued together if desired. 
62. Housed, or tank, joints. Fig. 116. 
Material: 3 pieces, 4” x 3” x }’. 
These joints are used in making waterproof tanks and sinks. 
Fitting the joint: At a is shown the form of joint generally used 
upon work which will allow sufficient wood beyond the groove, as at c, 
to give strength; it is somewhat 
cheaper to make than the joint at , 
which is commonly used for light 
tanks and sinks, as it may be made 
more nearly water-tight than the 
other form. 
1. Smooth the piece which is to 
connect the two ends. 
2. Mark with a try-square and 
knife the side cuts of the groove of 
end a, by adaptation of the method 
  described in Exercise 61. ONE 
3. Mark the end of the tenon of ‘sh 
b with a gauge, and lay out the Fs. eee or TANK, 
shoulder with a knife. ‘ 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
100 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
  4. Mark the side cuts of the groove to receive the tenon by the 
same method used in 2 above. Do not change the set of the gauge 
until it has marked the depth of the cuts a and 6 in the end pieces. 
5. Saw and make grooves carefully to marks. 
6. Smooth and sandpaper all sides of the pieces which will be inside 
after the model is together. 
7. Glue the model together, holding it with hand’ screws until the 
glue has set, after which, smooth and sandpaper wherever necessary. 
Joint a is used in stair building, in fitting the risers and treads into 
the skirting board, and in the inside corners of the baseboards of the 
best buildings, as the joint will not be opened by seasoning or settling. 
If a water-tight job is desired, the joints should be thoroughly doped 
with white lead. 
In building a water-tight tank or ink, the lower edges of the sides 
and ends should be doped with white lead, and two or three strands of 
cotton wicking, or soft twine, laid smoothly upon them. The bottom, 
being thoroughly nailed, will press upon the twine and calk the joint, 
which, if well made, will be water-tight. - 
This exercise should be so closely fitted that it will not require glue 
to hold it together, though it may be used if necessary, or the joints 
may be fastened with 14’ brads. 
63. Half-dovetailed joint. Fig. 117. 
Material: 2 pieces, 6” x 1} x 1}. 
This is a very strong joint when it «is in place with a vertical 
load upon it, as the dovetail 
resists all horizontal strains, 
and has a constant tendency 
to force itself together. It 
is sometimes used in fastening 
sills together at the corners 
as a substitute for the mortise 
joint. 
Fic. 117.— Harr-Dovertattep Jott. The exercise should be held 
together by a screw, as the 
construction of the joint can be seen only when the two pieces are 
separate.

-P-A-G-E-115
CONSTRUCTIVE EXERCISES 101 
This joint is used in fitting floor timbers to sills, girders, and plates, 
and is a very common one in building construction. Floor timbers 
are sometimes mortised into the sills and girts, but this is not generally 
done upon ordinary work. 
The size of the joint is regulated by the width of the timber, as it 
is measured from the upper edge, the distance from a to b being the 
same upon all timbers of the same 
floor, so that the top, edges of the floor 
timbers will be in line, and the floor 
will be straight. In practice, the ver- 
tical height of the shoulder c is not 
considered, but the distance between 
the shoulders of each end is sometimes 
important, as it may be used to govern | 
the distance between the walls. 
1. Gauge the distance a b from the 
top edge. 
2. Measure from the end of piece 
d, the thickness of piece e for the 
shoulder c; mark with the knife, and cut out with the backsaw. Upon 
ordinary work this joint is marked with a pencil. 
The piece d, representing the floor joint in this exercise, may be 
fastened to piece e, or the sill, by a brad; or it may be glued, if pre- 
ferred. Smooth and sandpaper each piece separately. 
65. Mortised joint. Fig. 119. 
Material: 2 pieces, 6” x 14” x #. 
This is a common form of joint, and may be made at any angle. 
It is used in framing girts into corner 
posts and the ends of braces, in the 
manufacture of doors, panel-work, 
and in nearly every place where two 
pieces are to be fastened together at 
any angle, and the greatest strength is 
desired. 
A. Laying out the joint: 1. Lay 
out with a knife the length of the 
tenon upon d, which should equal the

Fic. 118.—Cuxckep Jorn. 
     
-P-A-G-E-116
  102 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
2. Lay out the length of the mortise upon each edge of the mortise 
member, 6, in the middle of the piece, lengthways; to insure a 
close fit, this mortise 
should be a little less 
than the width of 
the tenon in length. 
If made too small, a 
light cut will remedy 
it. These two marks 
should be made with 
a sharp pencil, since in transferring the lines with a knife across 
the face of piece 6, a knife will make a scratch that will be difficult 
to remove. 
3. Use of the mortise gauge: Gauge for the mortise in piece b, and 
the tenon on the end of d.. Set the mortise gauge, Fig. 120, and mark 
both pieces at once without changing its set. It is economy to use 
this tool where two lines are to be made at once, as it saves hand- 
ling each piece over twice, 
and the marks may be 
made more accurately than 
if the ordinary gauge is 
used. This tool is used 
the same as a single-point 
gauge, the head being set 
in the right relation to 
the outside point (in this 
case, 7%s’”), the screw at the 
other end of the stick being 
manipulated to bring the 
inside point to its correct 
distance between the outer 
point and the head (in 
this case, }” from the 
former, which is the im- 
portant measurement).

  CONSTRUCTIVE EXERCISES 103 
Always working from the face side, mark around the two edges and 
the end of the tenon and the mortise, on both edges, using care not to 
make a scratch beyond the mortise or the tenon, as it will not work 
out. 
B. Cutting the joint: Bore a }’’ hole in the middle of the mortise 
from each side, halfway through. If bored from one side, it would 
probably not come through 
accurately. In a large 
mortise, or in hard wood, 
the mortise may be bored 
nearly out by boring 
several holes. In cutting 
out a small mortise with a 
narrow chisel, work from 
the hole in the center to 
each end of the mortise, 
holding the chisel at right 
angles with the grain of 
the wood, as shown in Fig. 
121. In this way it may 
be guided more accurately 
at the beginning of the 
cut than if held as in Fig. 
122, which is: the usual 
method of grasping a 
chisel for heavy work. 
After starting a chisel 
accurately in a small mortise, the hand will naturally slip up toward 
the handle. The back of the chisel, c, should be kept toward the 
end of the mortise toward which the student is working. Under 
no conditions should chisel cuts be made parallel with the grain 
until after the wood in the center of the mortise has all been cut 
out, as the wood at the side may be split. The tenon should 
be made by cutting out the wood on each side of it with a back- 
saw, and, if necessary, trimming with a chisel, as described in Topics 
59 Band C. 
C. Drawboring: Figure 123 A shows a mortised and tenon joint, 
drawbored ; the tenon shoulder, a, is less distant from the hole, c,

in the tenon than the mortised shoulder, 
b, is from the hole, d, which pierces the 
wood on each side of the mortise. When 
the tenon is pushed into the mortise, and 
a pin driven through the hole, it is 
obvious that the joint will be drawn 
to a perfect fit, if the work has been 
well done. This joint is frequently 
used in the construction of buildings, 
for additional strength, and where it

66. Mortised joint and relish. Tig. 124. 
Material: 2 pieces, 6” x 15” x J’. 
This joint is used in joining the stiles and bottom rails of doors, 
panelwork, ete. If the mor- 
tise extended to the bottom 
of the stile, to allow the tenon 
to be the full width of the 
rail, it is plain that it would 
be a weak joint, therefore the 
relish is cut out of the rail. 
This joint is made by the 
same methods as those above 
described. Hold together by pin, if necessary, but do not use glue. 
67. Dovetailed brace, or halved, joint. Fig. 125. 
Material: 2 pieces, 6” x 14” x f’. 
This joint is sometimes used to fasten braces into corner posts, 
girts, and sills, where they will be subjected to both tensile and com- 
pressive strains. A very strong joint may be made in this way, thongh 
piece b is weakened 50 per cent on account of the wood being cut 
away for the dovetail, and piece a still more. 
1. Fitting the joint: Set the bevel to the required angle for the 
shoulder, c, which is the angle of intersection, and cut the end of piece a 
at the same angle.

2. On the back of a, at a distance equal to the width of b, measure 
the distance d, or the width of piece b, square with the end; make a 
distinct knife mark by the bevel, which 
indicates the shoulder c. 
3. Without changing the angle of 
the bevel, make a pencil mark across 
the face of 6, at the place at which pieces 
a and b intersect. 
4. With a gauge set one half of the 
thickness of the pieces, mark the thick- 
ness of the dovetail on piece a, and of 
the slot which is to receive it, in picce 6, working from the face side 
of each piece. 
5. Saw to gauge marks of piece a and cut to shoulder c. 
6. Lay out with a knife, and cut shoulder ¢, 3’ from the edge of a, 
and cut the dovetail on one edge only. The edges of this dovetail should 
be made a very little less than square, or they should be “ cut under?’ 
so as to make the surface of the underside of the tail a trifle narrower 
than the upper, or face, side. The difference on the edges should 
be almost imperceptible when tested 
by the try-square. (If this is well 
done, it will insure a good joint on 
the face, but if it is cut under too 
much, the model may be ruined in 
trying to remedy ‘it.)

sharp knife make a distinct mark 
beside each edge of the dovetail, and square on the edges of b to 
the gauge marks. 
9. Cut out the slot to the gauge and knife marks, and trim them 
carefully with a sharp chisel. 
10. If the work has been accurately done at every stage, the dovetail 
will have to be forced a little to bring it to its place.

68. Mitered halved joint. Fig. 127. 
Material: 2 pieces, 6” x 13” x }’. 
This joint may be used in making a strong corner at any angle where 
it is necessary to show a miter upon one side, in order to allow mold- 
ings to intersect, as in a 
heavy picture or a mirror 
frame. It is, as its name 
implies, a combination of the 
halved and miter joint, the 
miter occupying one half of 
the thickness; or, if a mold- 
Fig. 127.— Mrrerep Hatvep Jornr. ing is being fitted together, 
the miter should be thick 
enough to insure that all the members of the molding will be upon one 
side of the half cut. 
Smooth and sandpaper separately ; do not fasten together. 
69. Doweled joint. Fig. 128. 
Material: 1 piece, 6 x 14’ x }’. 
1 piece, 43” x 14” x #”. 
If this joint is well made and not exposed to the weather, it 
is the most efficient substitute for the mortised joint, and may in 
general be used in any place where 
a mortised joint would be suitable; 
under certain conditions it is a stronger 
joint than that for which it is a 
substitute. For 7’ material, a 2” 
dowel should be used; but for any- 
thing thicker, a }’’ dowel is generally 
necessary to give the desired strength. 
In doweling thick material, the dowels 
should be placed as shown in Fig. 129. yg. 198, —Dowxtep Jomnt. 
A. Marking for dowels: Method 1. 
The utmost accuracy is necessary in marking the centers of the holes 
and boring them, if satisfactory results are desired. The prin- 
cipal application of this method is in doweling the joints of a 
wide board. 
1. Place the two pieces in the exact relative positions that they are 
to occupy permanently, as at A, Fig. 130, 
   
-P-A-G-E-121
  
CONSTRUCTIVE EXERCISES 107 
2. Make a pencil mark across the joint upon the faces of both pieces 
at once, as at aa. 
3. With either a pencil or knife, square across both edges of the 
joint from the marks, as at bb of B. 
4, With a sharp gauge, make mark c, which crosses bb. The inter- 
section of these two lines gives the center of the hole, or the point at 
which the point of the worm of the bit 
should be placed. 
5. A scratch awl should be used to 
make a small hole at the above described +- 
point, so that the bit will enter accurately, Frc. 129.— Dowets1n Tuck 
as otherwise it is apt to enter a little to Maeee Ee cen 
one side of the intersection, or to follow the 
grain. The reason for this will be apparent if the point of the worm 
is examined, since it is the point of a spiral; hence, the point will have 
a tendency to push to one side when 
the worm enters the wood. Bore 
# holes 1’ deep, and fit the dowels 
so that they may be pushed in with 
the fingers. 
Smooth and ‘sandpaper both 
pieces at once after the joint is 
made. Do not glue together. 
Doweling an edge joint: In laying 
out dowel holes in preparation for 
gluing up a wide board, many 
workmen prefer an application of 
Method 1, and for medium-sized 
work it is quite as practicable, and 
often faster. Place the two pieces, 
Fic. 130.— <A, B, Marxine ror ag shown in Fig. 95, with the face 
meus Marnop 1. C,PornTeD ides out, and square across the 
edges of both pieces at once. With 
a gauge, working from face sides, mark the distance from the face of the 
board to the center of the dowel holes, and proceed as in the previous 
problems. 
Length of dowels: It is not wise to use a dowel longer than is neces- 
sary; one extending from }” to 1)” each side of the joint will hold as   
   
-P-A-G-E-122
    
108 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
well as one reaching farther into the edge of the side wood, for the 
reason that the wood between the joint and the end of the dowel will 
shrink, and the longer the dowel, the greater the width of wood there 
is to be affected. A longer dowel may sometimes be necessary in the 
wide stile of a door, to give sufficient strength to resist the slamming 
which a door receives. A dowel should be at least }’’ shorter than the 
aggregate depth of the holes which are to receive it, and should be made 
loose enough to be pushed in with the fingers, but not loose enough to 
fall out or to be ‘rattled around. The ends of the dowel should be 
pointed, as at C, Fig. 130. This allows some of the glue to be forced 
up between the dowel and the sides of the hole, and not all pushed 
before the end of the dowel, which would be the result if the dowel 
were square-ended; unless the dowel were too loose, in which case 
it would not have its full strength, as the joint would not be wood 
to wood. 
Uniformity: In boring holes for dowels, it is the custom of many 
workmen to use one of the many forms of bit stops upon the market, 
in order to insure a uniform depth to all of the holes; others count 
the turns of the bit, from twenty to twenty-five giving the desired 
depth. This uniformity is necessary, otherwise the dowels will have 
to be cut to different lengths, which will require care and time to locate 
in their proper holes while the joint is being glued up, just when every 
second of time is precious. ‘ 
Comparison of the mortised and the doweled joint: As compared with 
a mortised joint, when used upon common doors, the dowel is not so 
satisfactory as the mortise, because the tenon reaches through the 
stile, and the glue, collecting at the joint as the pieces are brought 
together, makes a stronger connection there than at the end of the 
tenon at the outside of the stile; therefore, when the stile shrinks, 
it usually holds at the joint, and its outside edge draws toward 
the joint, allowing the end of the tenon to project beyond the stile 
the amount of the shrinkage. In a doweled door, the joint would 
probably open. 
The material used in making the ordinary grade of commercial 
doors is apt to be less thoroughly seasoned than it should be, and, as 
a rule, there are not enough dowels used to give the joint its maximum 
strength. Moreover, the dowels are generally placed in a straight 
line, instead of “ staggered,” as shown in Fig. 129. 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
  CONSTRUCTIVE EXERCISES 109: 
If a door which is exposed to the weather is properly doweled, it will 
stand better than a mortised door in which the tenon passes through 
the stile, since in the latter case the moisture will quickly find its 
way into the end of the tenon, and the door will be rapidly destroyed. 
The mortises of an outside door should be of the type known as 
“blind,” or “ fox wedging,” Fig. 141, as in this way the end of the 
tenon is protected from the weather. 
When used upon furniture and other work which is set up in a warm 
shop, and when made of thoroughly kiln-dried lumber, a properly made 
doweled joint is perfectly satisfactory. 
B. Gluing the dowels: The glue should be put in the hole, and not 
on the dowel; otherwise it will be scraped off as the dowel is’ pushed 
into its place, unless the latter is fitted very loosely, in which case the 
glue will soak into the end wood of the pieces being glued together, 
not leaving enough to hold the dowel firmly. The joint should be 
well fitted before the glue is applied; it should be forced together, 
and held in place by clamps until the 
glue has set. In preparing for gluing 
up wide boards, which are to be 
doweled, apply Method 1 of marking 
for dowels. 
C. Marking for dowels’ Method 2. 
This method of marking for dowels 
is sometimes used when it is not 
practicable to use Method 1, as 
in doweling irregular forms. See ee se res ane Donate 
Fig. 131. : 
1. Drive small brads, ¢, straight into the end of piece a. 
2. Cut off the heads of the brads at about }’” from the wood. 
3. Move piece } against a, being careful that the outsides are in 
just the right relation to each other, and apply enough pressure to 
make the brads leave imprints, d, in the end of piece b. These are the 
centers of the dowel holes. 
4. Pull the brads out of piece a; the holes thus made are the centers 
of the dowel holes in that piece. 
D. Marking for dowels: Method 3. 
If it is desired to dowel irregular forms, or to make a number of 
joints just alike, this method will not only give good results and 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  110 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
save a great deal of time, but the pieces just alike will be inter- 
changeable. 
1. Use of the templet: Make a templet of pasteboard; or, if it is 
to be used indefinitely, of tin or zinc, as shown in Fig. 132, and through 
it prick small holes in the posi- 
tion which will denote the exact 
centers of the desired dowels, 
as ata. 
2. Place the templet upon the 
end of piece b, with the corner c 
of the templet at ¢ of piece b, and 
flush with the face side; with a 
pricker, mark through the holes 
of the templet the centers of the

the edge of f, and flush with the face side, so as to coincide exactly

upon the edge of piece f. This method is much used upon large 
or irregularly shaped work of all kinds, as it permits of accurate 
work, and needs no tools but the 
templet and the pricker. The ends 
of the templet need not be turned 
over, as indicated, except for the 
purpose of making more rapid work 
possible.

they are ready for use. It will be seen that they furnish a grip for 
the hand screws or clamps; therefore it is necessary that the faces 
which receive the clamps should be approximately parallel. The joint 
may now be treated as a doweled edge joint. 
After the glue is set, remove the pieces a, b carefully; otherwise, 
they may take some of the wood of the model with them. Smooth 
and sandpaper the model.

principle, its advantage being that it may be used without waiting for 
the glue to set. After the joint is fitted, the clamp strips e and f should 
be prepared of any convenient material, and notches cut in them as 
at g g, faces h h being parallel. These clamp strips should be held 
rigidly to pieces j, & by hand screws, 1, m. After the glue is 
applied, hand screw n will hold the joint rigidly in place until the 
glue has set. Smooth and sandpaper the model. Either of the 
above methods may be applied in gluing pieces of any angle or of 
any irregular shape.

This is an important adjunct to a kit of carpenter’s tools, for if it 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  112 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
is made accurately, a perfect miter may be fashioned by its use. A 
box of this sort is of course inferior to an iron miter box, but it 
may be made at any time, while the iron box is unhandy to carry 
around. A wooden 
box is accurate only 
when first made, but 
it may receive as 
many new cuts as the 
size of the box will 
permit. 
Making the box: 
Joint the edges of the 
bottom perfectly 
square, and glue the 
sides upon them, hold- 
ing the sides in place, 
Fie. 135.—Woopren Miter Box. until the glue sets, by 
means of hand screws. 
Be sure that when the sides are in their places, their inside angles 
with the bottom are all perfect right angles. This form of wooden 
miter box is the most satisfactory, as there is no danger of sawing 
upon nails. 
If it is not practicable to use glue, the sides may be nailed upon 
the bottom, though the saw will in time cut down to the nails, unless 
care is used that the cuts are made and the nails driven so that they 
will clear each other. 
Making the cuts: The miter cut for a square miter may be found by the 
steel square (see Fig. 9), the inside top corner of the back of the box 
being the line upon which the steel square is placed in marking for 
the cuts. Any equal figures upon the outside of both the blade 
and the tongue held to coincide exactly with the top of the inside of 
the box, as described above, will give the angle. Lines should then 
be squared with a sharp knife to the bottom of the box upon both 
the inside and the outside, and cuts made to these lines with a keen, 
sharp saw, preferably with the one which is to be used in it. The 
life of a miter box is lengthened if but one saw is used, and that 
one with a very little set. Trim the ends of the box after it has 
been made.

Fig. 136. 
Material: 2 pieces, 6’ X14” x }’. 
This form of scarfed joint is used to lengthen timbers with the least 
possible sacrifice of shearing strength, the metho used in making it 
being similar to that described in Topic 60. Like other forms of 
construction of this type, it is not 
used as much as formerly, on 
account of the development of 
steel construction. It is, how- 
ever, valuable as an exercise in 
accuracy. 
The cut at a is made at an 
angle of about 60° with the edges 
of the pieces, and should be about 
3” long. The angle of the joint

hand. Note that, as the piece is shown, it is lying face side down, 
as the rabbet is to be upon the back side. 
1. Gauge from the face the distance, 6; in this case,75’’. 
2. Gauge from the

3. Place the fence 
piece, d, directly upon 
the piece to be rabbeted and hold the fence piece with small brads. 
Its purpose is to guide the rabbet plane (A, Fig. 138) in making 
the first cuts. The plane should be stopped directly at the gauge 
mark, b. ‘ 
This joint is simply an elaboration of the halved joint, the same 
methods of cutting and fitting being used as in Topic 61. 
A plane known as a “ filletster’”’ (B, Fig. 138) is constructed upon 
the same general principle as the rabbet plane, but it has, in addition, 
an adjustable depth and width gauge, which are a great convenience 
upon this kind of work, as a 
their use makes the fence, d, ee et 
and the gauge marks, b and c, 
superfluous. 
Do not fasten this joint 
together with glue. 
74. Table leg joint. Fig.

Material: 
1 piece, 44” x 24” x 24”, 
2 pieces, 6” X83” x 7. 
As its name implies, this 
joint is used to fasten the 
rails and legs of a table to- 
gether. It is an application of the mortised and the relish joint, Topic 
66, but it has a shoulder upon the face side only, as at a. This saves 
making two cuts upon each end of each rail, and gives a thicker and 
stronger tenon. The dowel joint is frequently used as a substitute.

The mortise gauge should be used in marking the leg for the mortise ; 
asinkage of from 1'’’ to $’’ should be allowed at b. In cutting the tenons 
on the ends of the rails, we have an illustration of a case in which it 
is best to work from the back side, instead of from the face, as the 
thickness of the tenon must be marked from that side. The joint is 
sometimes drawbored from the back side, which adds much to the 
strength of the table. 
Smooth and sandpaper separately, and do not glue together.

door, a single mortise would cut away too much wood, and make 
a tenon of too great width. The middle of the length of a mortise 
long enough to receive a very wide tenon, would have little strength, 
as the wood would all have been cut away, and that on each 
side of the mortise would not be stiff enough to give the joint the   
   
-P-A-G-E-130
  116 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
strength and rigidity it should have. By making two tenons in- 
stead of one, the shrinkage of a wide tenon is distributed, and the 
liability of breaking the glue connection is much decreased. In 
driving the wedges, they should be driven as 
at a; not beside the tenon, as at b, though this 
is the method usually followed upon common 
work. 
B. Blind, or fox, wedging: Upon the best 
grades of work, the wedges are frequently 
entered as shown in Fig. 141, which is called 
“blind,” or “fox,” wedging. In this, the mor- 
tise is cut longer at the bottom than at the Fig. 141.—Burnp, or . . . i Fox-wepcup, Mor- Joint, and when the tenons are forced into their 
qisep JOINT. places by the clamps, the wedges are pushed 
into the cuts made to receive them, thereby 
spreading the tenon and forming a dovetail, which makes a very 
strong joint. This joint is often used upon the best grades of 
outside doors, as the end of the tenon is not exposed to the 
weather. Good judgment and careful work are necessary to make 
this joint well. 
76. Coped joint. Fig. 142 (sash joint). 
Material: 1 piece, 6” x 23’’ x 1%’. Molded on one edge. 
1 piece, 4” X 1” X13”. Molded on two edges. 
This material may be secured at a sash factory or a planing mill, 
though the student may make his own molding, as a straight bevel 
will answer all the purposes 
of this problem. 
“Coped joint” is the term 
applied to that form of butt 
joint in which the end piece, a, 
is fitted to the molded edge of 
piece 6, the end of piece a 
being cut to fit the contour of 
piece b. The fact that the con- 
nection may be strengthened 
by a mortise, as it is in Fig. 
142, or by a tongue and 
groove, as it is in C and # of Fig. 142.—Corrp Jour.

  CONSTRUCTIVE EXERCISES 117 
Fig. 143, does not alter the fact that the coped joint itself.is an elabora- 
tion’of the square butt joint. 
Uses of the coped joint: A coped joint shows a miter on its face, as 
in the face view at C, Fig. 142; it is used in many places where mold- 
ings intersect, and it is desirable to show a miter, as in cutting in base 
moldings, as at A, Fig. 143, 
or room moldings, as at B. 
It is chiefly employed upon 
moldings of small dimensions. 
In practice, if an inside joint 
is mitered, the joint will be 
nailed open when the nails 
are driven ; but if it is coped, 
the full length piece, b, of A 
and B, Fig. 148, is nailed 
firmly into its permanent 
place, and the coped pieces, 
a, are cut long enough to allow 
them to be sprung and forced 
into making a perfect fit. 
Fitting a coped joint: In describing this exercise, the joint of a 
sash has been taken as a model. After the pieces are prepared, pro- 
ceed as follows: 
1. Mark tenon on a, and mortise on 6 of Fig. 142, so that they will 
each come in the flat inside edge, d; cut them, working only to the 
shoulder, e. 
2. Place ain a miter box and cut the miters f, g, mitering the mold- 
ing only. Asa coped joint shows a miter, this will give the edge, or line, 
to which the end must be cut. 
3. With convenient sizes of chisels and gouges, cut away the wood, 
leaving the mitered edges f, g, of piece a, as shown in section AA; 
cut back far enough so there will be no wood to prevent piece a from 
fitting perfectly against the edge of 6, but be careful not to cut back 
of the edges, f, g, on the surface of the molding, or back of the shoulder, 
e, qn the face of piece a. Cut the pieces to the desired length, smooth 
and sandpaper them. 
Forms of this joint are used in making ordinary grades of panel- 
work and stock doors; see C, D, H, Fig. 143.

This joint is used in heavy wooden construction in places where it

viously a weaker joint in regard to resistance to a shearing stress, if 
concentrated at the joint, than is that described in Exercise 72.

3. With a sharp gauge, lay out upon both sides of each piece in the 
order given, the lines f, g, h; be careful not to continue the lines be- 
yond the point where they will cut away, or they will cause a blemish 
upon the finished model. Work from the face side and edge at all 
times.

be perfectly straight: if there is any deviation, it should be a little 
rounding in its length. If this should be done very carefully, and if 
all the work is executed with accuracy, all members of the joint will 
fit perfectly. 
6. After all the fitting is done, clamp the pieces in their permanent

A. Laying out and cutting the dovetails: © 
In making a dovetailed joint, some work- 
men lay out and cut the pin, a, first, which 
necessitates that the tails, 6, should be 
marked and cut one at a time. Good 
results may be obtained by this method, yg. 145. Puan Dove-

practical work. The common method 
used by workmen is to saw the tails, b, first, and mark the pins by the 
tails. If two or more joints are to be dovetailed alike, the sides may 
be made into a bunch, and all sawed at once, as shown in Fig. 146. 
The pieces for this exercise should 
be prepared about 2” longer than 
actually needed, as it is possible that 
the first attempt will be a failure. 
1. Make the ends to be dovetailed 
perfectly square and true.

an equal distance from 
each edge, say }’, mark 
the distance, h, of the two 
outside tails. These should 
be rather small, not more 
than 76”. Lay out an 
equal distance halfway 
between these two for 
another tail. 
4, Mark the bevel of 
the pin; this may vary, 
but the bottom, g, of the 
tail, should not be more 
than 5" for }” stock. If 
the angle of the tail is too sharp, it is apt to be broken off when the 
pieces are driven together. ~ 
5. Saw with a backsaw, in every case leaving the line of the piece 
which is wanted. 
6. Lay the pieces face down upon the bench, and with a chisel nar- 
rower than the bottom of the cut, make one cut, as at a, 
Fig. 147. This will minimize the tendency of the chisel to 
push back, so that when the next cut is made upon the line 
d, the wood will break into cut a, as at b, instead 
of pushing the chisel back of line d, as at c, which 
will probably happen if cut a is omitted.

case the cut is made outside of m and n, or that these lines are left on 
the pin. 
5. Turn the piece over in the vise so that the cuts p, g may be made 
in each edge. These should be made exactly to the line upon each sur- 
face of the cut, with a backsaw. This will cut out the corner, ¢. If 
the work has been accurately done, these corners should not be touched 
again. 
6. Clean out the spaces, 7, with a chisel by the same method used 
in cutting the tails. See A 6, of this topic. 
7. If this work has been done with sufficient accuracy, there will be 
no need of trimming either the pin or the tail to allow the two pieces 
to come together and make a perfect joint. To attain this accuracy 
should be the ambition of each student, as the skillful workman must be 
able to make dovetails rapidly, surely, and without trimming. In 
cutting the pins, the amateur is quite as likely to cut inside as outside 
of the lines, thus making the pins too small; this tendency should be 
guarded against, and the pins, s, s, s, left the exact size desired. In 
every case, the saw cut should be made with such care that chiseling or 
fitting will be unnecessary, as it is quite as likely to injure as to improve 
the joint. 
8. The inside of both pieces should be smoothed and sandpapered 
before being put together permanently ; and care should be taken not to 
plane any off of the back side of the pins, or they may be too small. 
If the pins fit too closely, with a hammer bruise the corners of their ends 
a little, where they enter the space between the tails; this makes them 
a little smaller, but when they are glued together, the moisture of the 
glue will swell the pins to their normal size. Glue the pieces together, 
being sure that the angle of the joint is square ; apply the glue sparingly. 
If the work has been done accurately, the joint should be so tight 
that when it is set away for the glue to harden, it will hold itself together 
without the aid of hand screws; though if necessary, these may be 
used judiciously. 
9. Smooth and sandpaper. 
79. Half-blind dovetailed joint. Fig. 151. 
Material: 1 front, 44” x 3” x ¥". 
1 side, 44 x 3” x 4”. 
This is the joint which is used in the construction of drawers upon 
the best grades of work. (In laying out the dovetails of a drawer side,
-P-A-G-E-137
  CONSTRUCTIVE EXERCISES 123 
care should be used that the groove for the drawer bottom comes in one 
of the tails, for if it comes in a pin, it will show upon the end of the 
drawer front.) As this is 
the form of dovetailing 
used the most, there have 
been several machines in- 
vented for the purpose of 
dovetailing drawers, and 
the work of the best of 
these is equal in strength 
to the work done by hand, 
though no machine has yet 
been devised which will 
exactly reproduce hand- 
made dovetails. 
In making the half-blind 
dovetailed joint, we have Fig. 151.—Haur-suinp Doverariep Jom. 
another instance in which 
it is necessary to work from the back, instead of from the face of the 
front, as we will designate the §’’ piece. 
After the pieces have been prepared as described in the last para- 
graph of Topic 78 A, proceed as follows: 
1. Marking and cutting the joint: Set the gauge to the thickness of 
the side, and gauge upon both sides of the end of the side which is to 
be dovetailed, as at a a. With- 
out changing the set of the gauge, 
working from the back corner, or 
corner 6, of the back of the front, 
make gauge marks, c, which in- 
dicate the length and depth of 
the space that must be cut out 
from between the pins, d, d, d, 
and the corners, e, e. 
2. Lay out, saw, and cut the 
dovetails upon the end of the 
side. Mark the pins upon the 
Fig. 152.—Haurpunp Doveran; end of the front, being careful 
Sawine Tsp Pus. that the lines a of the side, and b 
   
-P-A-G-E-138

of the front, coincide perfectly, and proceed by the same method 
as in the preceding problem. The experienced workman learns to 
make the cut without the guide lines c, of Fig. 152, with sufficient 
accuracy to insure a good fit, but the amateur should be cautious in 
attempting methods of work which are beyond his skill. 
3. Saw the pins as indicated in Fig. 152 at a, and with a chisel cut 
out the rest of the space which is to receive the dovetails of the side. 
Workmen who have much of this to do generally have a short, stout 
chisel, which may be handled more easily than one of the ordinary size. 
Cut out corners, e, with a backsaw, as far as possible, placing the piece 
in the vise so that a nearly vertical cut may be 
made on all sides, as it is difficult to make an 
accurate cut in any other position.

On account of the time and skill necessary to

2. Lay out the square a a, indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 154,

3. Cut the square a a to exact size, being careful not to cut beyond 
the miter lines, using a backsaw and finishing with chisels.

make a templet of a piece of thin card-

teeth are carefully laid out, and cut and 
use this to mark the bevels on both

more accurate work possible.

  CHAPTER IV 
SupPLEMENTARY MOopuLs 
Tue construction of the following supplementary ex- 
ercises is based upon the problems discussed in the pre- 
vious chapter. It is assumed that the student has, by 
the preceding exercises, gained a knowledge of ‘tools and 
processes sufficient to enable him to select wisely those 
which he should use to accomplish certain results ; there- 
fore these models are intended to be only suggestive, 
and it is not necessary to follow the course as outlined. 
Any model may be selected which is of approximately 
the same degree of difficulty as those described. Speci- 
fied exercises will not generally be mentioned, but at 
each step the previous work should be reviewed, and 
its application to the work in hand carefully considered. 
Complete dimensions of models are sometimes purposely 
omitted, as the student should use his judgment in de- 
veloping a working drawing from the sketch of each 
model that he makes. The stock lists are made out for 
a few of the models simply to indicate the method to 
be followed in making out the lists for others, and not 
for the purpose of making the work easy. Unless noted 
otherwise, the following models may be made of any soft 
wood. In making them, the student should in each case 
first make a working drawing, being guided by Chapter II. 
A stock list should be prepared by the method indicated 
128
-P-A-G-E-143
  SUPPLEMENTARY MODELS 129 
in those following. The exact dimensions should be placed 
upon the stock’list in the order given, —length, width, 
and thickness, though in some localities the order is 
thickness, width, and length. Allowance for working 
should be made when the stock is cut. 
81. Bench hook. Fig. 155. (See Handbook: Fig. 14.) 
A. Stock list: 1 cutting board, 12” x 6” x #’. 
1 hook, 24” x 6” x}. 
1 rest, 24 X 4" x}: 
B. Length and width of wood: In the above dimensions, which are 
given in the order of length, width, and thickness, it will be noticed 
that the last two items are wider than they are long. It is the in- 
variable custom that the length of a board shall be parallel with the 
  Fic, 155.— Brncu Hook. 
grain, and the width at right angles to it. This model is useful upon 
the work bench for the purpose of holding work while it is being cut 
(see Figs. 88 and 90), and of providing a place upon which all cutting 
should be done, as a cut should never be made directly upon the bench 
with any sort of cutting tool. 
C. Sequence of work: 1. Prepare one piece }’’ wider and 23” longer 
than necessary to include all the pieces in one length. 
2. Plane one edge, and block plane each end straight and square, 
regardless of the length of the piece. 
3. Cut one piece 3” long from each end, and make one piece of the 
required width for the rest, or narrow piece. 
4, Plane the cutting board smooth, but do not sandpaper it. 
5. The vertical distance between the inside faces of the hook and 
KING’S EL. CONSTRUCT. —9
-P-A-G-E-144
  130 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
the rest should, of course, be 7’’, which should be laid off in the middle 
of the length of the cutting board. Indicate the location of the hook 
by two knife points (not a mark) the entire width of the board. Locate 
the rest upon the opposite side of the board by the same method, as 
shown in the sketch. In placing both pieces, the squared end should 
form the vertical faces. Do not mark with a pencil, as the black mark 
will disfigure the finished model. 
6. Bore screw holes in the hook and in the rest, using a German bit, 
and countersink the holes; by this is meant the boring of a hole which 
tapers from the surface of the board to the center of the hole, and 
which allows the screw head to be driven flush, or below the surface of 
the wood. Hold both pieces in their exact places, and with a hammer 
tap the screws lightly, but sufficiently to mark the holes in the cutting 
board; remove the pieces preparatory to gluing, and bore small holes 
in the cutting board to receive the screws. 
7. Be sure that both the small pieces fit the cutting board; spread 
the glue sparingly upon the side of the hook which is to form the joint, 
and force it into its place by screws. Do the same with the rest, and 
whether the joint is as good as it should be or not, apply hand screws 
to force the pieces of wood closely together, and hold them while the 
glue hardens. If the pieces are not held firmly, the moisture of the 
glue will cause the pieces to swell upon the sides which have received 
it, thus causing the joint to open at the edges. 
8. After the glue has hardened, treat the pieces as one, cut to length, 
blockplane the ends, plane to width, and make the model square and 
true. If the work is planned and executed accurately, each of the three 
pieces will finish the size called for in the stock list.

A. Drawing curves through given points: Make the piece square and 
parallel, and mark the intersections of the curves upon it from the di-

SUPPLEMENTARY MODELS 131 
mensions given; these marks should be made upon the face side, as 
shown in the sketch, and curves should be carefully drawn through the 
intersections, as indicated. They should be drawn free hand; by rest- 
ing the elbow upon the bench, and using it as the center of an arc, an 
almost perfect curve may be made. In working down to these marks 
  Fie. 157.— Use or THs SpokesHave — TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE GRAIN. 
with a compass saw, or with a frame or turning saw, care should be used 
that the marks are not cut off. (A frame.saw is simply a small buck- 
saw; it is preferred by many workmen for nearly all purposes for 
which a compass saw would ordinarily be used, as it does not bend nor 
break so easily, and the are of a smaller circle may be cut.) 
B. Sawing “ under”: It seems that every novice has an irresistible 
tendency to “ cut under ” in a case of this sort; that is, to make the 
back side of a piece of work smaller than its face: the result of this is, 
that the piece must be cut below size, or the edge finished out of square, 
neither of which is permissible. To prevent this, the edge of the blade 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  132 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
should be carried as nearly as possible at right angles with the face of 
the board, and about }’’ outside of the mark. 
C. The grain: Study the direction in which the grain runs, and as 
the spokeshave is to be used, the student should be careful to work in 
the direction in which the tool cuts without tearing the grain. The 
method of grasping the spokeshave is shown in Fig. 157, and the direc- 
tion indicated by the arrows should be the direction of the cut of the 
spokeshave upon the inside of the model. If these directions are re- 
versed, the wood will generally be badly torn, as the cut will be against 
the grain. Upon the outside of the coat hanger, the stroke should 
be made from the middle to the end. 
D. Use of the wood file: This is the first model upon which the 
wood file should be used, and here only in smoothing off a curve after 
the spokeshave has done all that it can. Unless care is exercised with 
this tool, the sharp corners of the work may be chipped off and de- 
stroyed. 
E. Machine planing: Boards which have been run through the 
planing machine are not ready for the sandpaper; they should always 
be smoothed with a smoothing plane, as it is almost impossible to 
remove with sandpaper the minute ridges which are left by the planer 
at right angles with the grain of the wood. 
F. Smoothing and sandpapering: The term ‘ smoothing” applies 
only to planing; if sandpapering is meant, it will be noted separately. 
This model should receive a shellac finish, well rubbed down; one 
coat of shellac will be enough, if it is not too thin, and provided it is 
finished with wax finish and well rubbed. 
83. Foot rest. Fig. 158. (See Handbook: Fig. 37.) 
Material: Any wood of medium hardness. 
Itop, 13" xX 837 Xx #7. 
4 legs, 63” x1" x #”. 
2 side rails, 124/” x 12” x #”. 
2 end rails, 8” x 1?” x #”. 
Make allowances for working beyond listed dimensions. 
In this model the joints are locked, 3's’ being cut out of each leg and 
intersecting rail, allowing the latter to project }’ beyond the legs. 
A. Fitting locked joints: Care should be used in cutting the joints, 
as the sides of the cut must be square with both the face sides and the 
edges. It is safer to make the cuts very close, since it is better to have “
-P-A-G-E-147
  SUPPLEMENTARY MODELS 133 
to trim a little, than to have an open joint, As the student gains skill, 
the correct cut will be made the first time. See Topic 61. 
B. Cutting “ standing”: Contrary to the tendency of the amateur 
in the previous model, his tendency in work of this sort is to cut “ stand- 
ing”; that is, to : 
       
         make the sides of z sas ee ee aes = 
the cut wedge- ds A d OD shaped toward Bis a aur aes ysis i 
      each other, thus 
preventing the 
piece, which is 
supposed to fit, 
from coming to a 
joint. In theory, 
a joint of this sort 
should always be 
cut perfectly 
square with the face; but in practice, either it should be cut slightly 
under, or the bottom of the cut should be made a very little larger than 
at the face of the joint, in order to insure a perfect fit upon the face. 
C. Smoothing and scraping: These pieces should be smoothed, 
scraped, and sandpapered before being glued together. The top should 
be put on by dowels, by Method 2, Topic 69. 
Finishing: This model may be finished in the natural wood by a 
filler and shellac, or by a stain with either a shellac or a wax finish. 
Upholstering: If desired, the top may be made of any ordinary wood, 
and upholstered by covering it loosely with cotton cloth fastened on 
three edges, and filled from the fourth with curled hair, moss, or tow. 
It should then be covered with the desired material, which should be 
fastened to the edge with common tacks, and the latter covered with 
gimp and ornamental upholsterer’s tacks.

A. The bottom and sides: The bottom of this box should not be cut 
to the exact size until the ends and sides are nailed together, on account 
of the possibility of variation, as the bottom is to fit the rim, and 
not the rim the bottom. The student will notice that the partition

is halved, or housed, into each end, as at g, and the ends into the sides, 
as at f, each joint being cut halfway through the thickness of the stock. 
The curves of the partition should be carefully studied, and accurately 
worked out. 2 
B. The rim: The sides and ends of the rim should be smoothed upon 
both sides, and sandpapered upon the inner sides before being put to- 
gether; the outer sides of these pieces may be sandpapered better after 
they are nailed together. The grooves in the ends for the partition 
should be cut before the pieces are sandpapered on the inner side. 
Glue should be used sparingly on the joints of the rim, so as not to 
be squeezed into the inside of the box, thereby causing unnecessary 
work in cleaning it off. The bottom should be made square, and of a 
size to project beyond the rim 4’ upon all sides, after which the corner 
should be chamfered as indicated, or rounded to a true quarter round. 
If the latter form is adopted, care should be used that the curve does
-P-A-G-E-149
SUPPLEMENTARY MODELS 135 
not extend upon the top of the bottom far enough to prevent the rim 
of the box from fitting. 
C. Fitting the rim to the bottom: In order to insure that the joint 
between the bottom of the rim and the bottom of the box is as nearly 
perfect as possible, the inside of the bottom of the rim should be planed 
under a little. This may be accomplished by resting the plane upon 
two sides of the box rim, 
and making the stroke as 
shown in Fig. 160, the iron 
cutting between its cen- 
ter and the outside of the 
face of the plane. This 
will allow the middle of 
the iron to cut upon the 
inside of the box more 
than upon the outside, 
thus “ cutting under,” and 
making the outside of the 
box fit the bottom closely 
where it is the most con- 
spicuous. 
D. The partition and 
handle. The partition, 
b, Fig. 159, should be 
smoothed and sandpa- Fic. 160.— Puanine rue Epae or a Box

and nailed ; and the round 
handle, e, prepared and fastened by }’ dowels, which should be thor- 
oughly glued and wedged, as at h, to prevent the handle from being 
pulled off. Be sure that the wedges are driven at right angles with the 
grain, or they may split the handle. Extreme care should be exercised 
not to bore the holes which are to receive the dowels through the sides 
of the partition at 7. Long, slender, round-headed screws may be used 
instead of the }’’ dowels, if desired. 
E. Nailing: In nailing the box together, 1}’’ brads should be used, 
which should be driven both ways of the joint, as shown at k, Fig. 159. 
Do not use common nails, as they should be used only upon the roughest 
work, and where the greatest strength is necessary.   
   
-P-A-G-E-150
  136 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
F. Nails: The nails used by carpenters, illustrated in Fig. 161, are 
of four different kinds, as follows : — 
Jommon nails, A, which range in size from 3d (3 penny) to 60d 
box nails, other nails for common use being generally of this type. 
Finish nails, B, which range in size from 6d to 10d, and are used for 
moldings, picture frames, and other places where it is required that 
anes 7 0 the nails should be as nearly invisible as possible. 
This shape of head may be set beneath the surface 
with the least danger of splitting the wood. The 
smaller sizes of this type of nail are called brads, 
or sprigs, and range in sizes from 2’’ to 14’ and 
are of different sizes of wire. 
Casing nails, C, used for fastening casings, or 
inside finish, though the finish nails are often 
A used for this purpose. The heads of these nails 
Fic. 161. are supposed to enter the wood without tearing 
as Cent dail. it, making only a clean round hole. 
B, Finish nail, or brad. Flooring nails, D, the most essential difference 
% tee aaa between this type of nail and the finish or casing 
nail being the size of wire from which it is made, 
which will, in most cases, allow the nail to be driven into moderately 
hard wood without the necessity of boring a hole for cach nail. 
85. Bookshelf. Fig. 162. 
Material: 2 ends, 18} X 6” X 3”. 
2 shelves, 234” X 53” X }””. 
1 back, 234” x 6” X 9”. 
1 back, 23} x 4” xX 4”. 
Construction ef model: The ends of the bookease should be grooved 
or housed, as at f, to receive the shelves, the length of which should be 
?’ less than the outside length of the case, to allow for the depth of 
the groove. These grooves should be laid out by knife marks, and 
to insure their fitting the shelves closely, should be made a little less 
in width than the thickness of the shelves which enter them, just as 
the cuts in a halved joint are made smaller than the pieces that go into 
them. Attention is called to the horizontal section aa, which shows that 
the groove is stopped 3’ from the face edge of the end, and that the 
shelf is notched {3,’’, as at g, so as to prevent the groove from showing 
on the front edge of the end, as it would if it were cut through. The
-P-A-G-E-151
  SUPPLEMENTARY MODELS 137 
shoulder cuts, or the cuts across the face edges of the shelves, should be 
made upon all the shelves at once, clamping the pieces together for 
that purpose. The distance between them should be carefully cal- 
culated so as to make each shoulder about },"’ less than the extreme length of 
the shelves; this will allow the ends of the shelves, beyond the shoulders, 
which fit into the grooves of the ends of the case, to be a little less than 
the depth of the grooves, as at h, thus insuring a good joint at c and g,

at each end of the shelf. The depth of the shoulder should be about 
qs". This is the most important joint of the case, and the fitting should 
be done carefully, as a poor joint at ¢ will be in the most conspicuous 
place. 
The face edges of the shelves should set back from the face edges of 
the ends about 4”, as it is an almost invariable custom that two pieces 
should not be finished flush in work of this sort. This, to some extent, 
hides an imperfect joint, if one is made, or any opening after the work 
is finished. ; 
The backs should be fitted into a rabbet made in the back of the ends, 
as shown by the section b.b. Any suggestion of the shape of the ends 
is purposely omitted, as the student should make his own design, being 
governed by the advice of the teacher. 
This model may be finished in the natural wood with shellac, well 
rubbed down, or may receive a dark stain and a wax finish.

18 F.H.B. screws, 1” No. 9. 
A. Gluing a wide board: Thisisan exercise in gluing up a board so 
that the effect of the tendency to warp will be minimized, which may 
be accomplished by so placing narrow pieces that the concave and con- 
vex sides of the annual rings will alternate in forming the surface of the 
  
  
      
  
  
    
  Fie. 163.— Drawine Boarp. 
board. These sides may be determined by examining the annual rings 
of the boards, which may be seen at either end. As the tendency of 
a board is to warp with its concave side toward the outside of the tree, 
the warp of each narrow piece will offset that of those which join it. 
(See Fig. 8, “‘ Elements of Woodwork.”) The joints should be care- 
fully fitted and doweled; see Topic 69, Method 1. 
B. Cleating across the grain: The cleats should be screwed upon the 
back as shown; the holes for the screws being slotted by boring two 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
MET NE Ne Ee ee ee ee ee ey ee ee 
SUPPLEMENTARY MODELS 139 
holes beside each other, parallel with the grain, which will allow the 
screws to move a little back and forth as the board shrinks and swells. 
A cleat should never be glued across the grain, as when the board 
begins to shrink, the glue will not allow it to do so, and the result will 
be that the joints will open, or the board will warp and twist badly. 
The cleat may be glued in the center for two or three inches, if desired, 
though this is not at all necessary ; but it allows the board to shrink from 
the edges to the middle, and the screw holes being slotted, will permit 
this movement to take place without its surface or shape being affected. 
C. Squaring the board: The ends of the board should be jointed per- 
fectly straight, and square with the face and sides of the board, so that 
the T square will move accurately upon either end, or edge. 
_ D. The surface of a drawing board: After the board is carefully 
straightened and smoothed, it should be sandpapered diagonally from 
each corner, and finished parallel with the grain. It needs no finish 
aside from the sandpapering.

edged with maple or white holly, but it is not necessary except that it 
makes a better looking job. If the gluing is well done, however, a piece 
of glued-up work will hold its shape better than if made of one piece.

A. Accuracy of the model: This model 
requires that the utmost care should be 
exercised at each step, for unless the com- 
pleted model is absolutely accurate, it is 
worthless. Straighten one edge of the 
tongue carefully, after which the other 
edge should be made perfectly parallel. 
3 The head may be of any desired shape. 
ape The tongue should be fastened to the 
2 head of the square by means of small 
screws and glue. Use glue sparingly, and

first. Set the tongue in its exact relation with the head, placing a steel 
square, as indicated, to insure accuracy. Set up the vise to furnish 
sufficient pressure to hold the picces firmly while putting in the first two 
or three screws, after which a handscrew may be put over the screws 
already in place, and the square removed from the vise, while the rest 
of the screws are being driven. Lay the square away for the glue to 
set, with handscrews so placed as to impart an equal pressure on all 
parts of the joint. 
For finishing the model, two thin 
coats of shellac should be applied 
and well rubbed down.

Sequence of work: Get out all the 
pieces except the panels 6, and the 
beads h, which hold the panels in 
place to their exact dimensions. 
The stiles should be planed square 
upon their inside edge; that is, the Fic. 166. —TureeroLp Screen.

  SUPPLEMENTARY MODELS 141 
edge against which the shoulders of the tenons fit. Work from the face 
side, and leave the stiles the full width to which the piece has been 
roughly cut (without planing the other edge) and an inch or more 
longer than desired, as this extra wood may be needed before the 
screens are finished. 
Cut off the top rails, c, the middle rails, d, and the bottom rails, e, 
2” longer than the desired distance between the stiles, because the 
tenons on each end will enter the mortise in the stiles, 1”. Mark all 
the shoulders on these rails at once, allowing exactly the same distance 
between, that it is desired that the stiles shall be apart; mark each 
separately, and square carefully around all sides with a distinct knife 
mark, working always from the face side and edge. 
B. Laying out mortises and tenons: The stiles should now be placed 
side by side, inside edges up, as in Fig. 167. Across the inside edges 
of all the stiles draw pencil 
lines square with the sides, 
as at b, indicating the exact, 
location and length of the 
mortises. With a mortise 
gauge set to make the marks 
for a ¥’ mortise, mark all 
the mortises in the stiles, 
and the tenons on the ends of 
all the rails, without chang- 
ing the set of the gauge, work- Fyg. 167.— Turerronp Screen—Marxrna

ease. This is important. 
With a }” bit, bore one hole in the middle of the length of each 
mortise, and with a }” chisel, cut out the mortise, cutting across the 
grain in every case, never parallel with it; be careful that neither the 
1’ hole nor the mortise goes through to the other edge of the stile. 
C. Drapery rods: Bore a 3” hole, 1” deep, 1” to its center above 
the bottom rail, as at f,and the same distance below the middle rail, as 
at g, to receive the dowels or brass rods which support the drapery 
panels. Smooth and sandpaper the edges of the rails and stiles, except 
the outsides of the latter, but not the sides of any of the pieces. x 
D. Gluing: Glue the frames together, holding them in place by 
clamps, as in Fig. 168, which are used for the same purpose as hand- 
 
-P-A-G-E-156

screws upon work which is too large for the latter to reach. These 
should be placed exactly opposite each rail, so as to hold the frame 
square. If the frame is not perfectly square, move one clamp to a

slight angle, as at ab; this angle and its direction must be such that 
the pressure applied by the clamp will pull the frame square.and hold 
it so until the glue sets. 
E. Squaring the frames: Do not use a square to test the frame, 
because the clamp may spring the stile out of a perfectly straight line, 
in which case a square would be useless. Use a stick of suitable length, 
sharpened to a chisel point, to measure the diagonals cd, and ef. Place 
the point of the stick in the angle at d, and make a pencil mark at c; 
change the stick to ef and compare cd and ef. By swinging the 
clamp as described above, make the diagonals the same length, if the 
first measurements do not coincide. 
After the glue has set, joint the edges of the stiles square and to the 
desired width. Smooth and scrape both sides of the frame. If strap 
hinges, as shown in Fig. 170, are to be used, round the edges as shown 
at e, Fig. 169, and sandpaper thoroughly. 
F. Beads and panels: Prepare, miter, and fasten in place upon one 
side of the frame the small beads shown at f, Fig. 169. These should 
be made flush with one face of the frame, 
leaving those of the other side loose. 
They may be made with a bead plane, 
which makes a molding shaped like 
  Fic. 169.— Turerrotp Screen es . “_Seorion or Stiues ror those indicated, or the pieces may be

molding may be used which does not project beyond the face of the 
frame, in which case the screen cannot be folded together. Cut the 
panels, g, to the correct size; smooth, scrape, and 
sandpaper them ; then remove the loose beads, put 
the panels in place, and fasten the other beads, 
which will hold the panel securely. 
G. Finish and hinges: Stain, fill, and finish the 
screen to suit taste. Prepare twelve strips of thin 
sheet brass or rawhide, say 3” x1”, for hinges, 
and put them on as shown in Fig. 170, using brass 
tacks with a very flat round head, so that they 
will not mar the face of the screen which is folded 
against them. This makes a satisfactory screen 
hinge, as it allows the screen to be opened either u ee see 
way; two of the strips make one hinge, and three var Fry Hina. 
hinges are necessary for each joint. An ordinary 
hinge may be used, in which case the stiles should be left square. 
Hinges of this sort will allow the screen to swing but one way. 
H. Drapery panel: Six 3’ dowels, or brass curtain rods, should be 
made the right 
length to enter 
the holes which 
were bored to re- 
ceive them ; these 
are to hold the 
drapery which 
forms the large 
panel of the 
screens. The 
drapery should 
then be adjusted 
on the rods and 
the latter sprung 
into position.

Get out the stock list. From the dimensions upon it, cut the ta- 
pered legs and the rails. Make the table leg joint, smooth and sand- 
paper the members, and glue them together. In cutting the material 
for the top, the appearance of thickness may be secured without the 
expense or the weight of using thick stock, as follows: Cut the top 
from {”’ stock, and glue it up in the ordinary way, making a doweled 
glue joint. Cut the top to its required size roughly, and straighten 
the under side across the ends by traverse planing. Glue pieces about 
5’ wide and as long as the top on the under side of the top, flush 
with the edges. Cut pieces 5” long, and wide enough to fill in be-

The whole may now be treated as though the entire top were made 
of thick material. Fasten the top on by one of the methods indicated 
at A or B, Fig. 172. If it is desired to make a more elaborate table, 
the construction need not. be essentially different. Upon a table 
of this size, the top should not project more than 14/’ beyond the 
legs.

the stretcher, and the mortises in the standards, before the pieces 
are cut to their desired shape, as it is much more convenient to 
work from the face edge of a rectangular piece than from the cen- 
ter line, aa, which would be necessary if the standards were made as 
designed. 
2. Cut and fit the shoulders and tenons of the stretcher, and the 
mortises of the standards, to each other, using care that the shoulders, 
e, of the stretcher, and the tops and bottoms of the mortises are made 
at the correct angle. To guard against the tendency to cut the mor- 
tises so large that the tenons will not fill them, 
the student should make a very close fit, 
in anticipation of trimming, if necessary, when 
the pieces are fitted together. The mortises 
should be bored out as much as possible to 
avoid the liability of splitting the standard 
while using the chisel and mallet. The mor- 
tises should be cut under on all sides, as in- 
dicated at g, Fig. 174, in order to insure a 
perfect fit upon the surface. 
3. Design the contour of the standards, 
stretcher, and side rails, and work out their 
forms carefully, using a wood rasp or file, Fic. 174.—Prano Bence

pieces and glue them back in their places. 
4. The top and the bottom of the wedge must be parallel, and when 
it is in place, the outside should be plumb, and the inside planed to fit 
the angle of the standard, and wedged, or tapered, about 3,’’ for each 
inchinitslength. The wedges should be made considerably longer than 
necessary, so that they may be driven as they are fitted, and not cut 
to length until the foot rest is ready to be set up permanently. 
5. Smooth, scrape, and sandpaper the standards and stretcher. 
6. Fit the side rails in their place$, halving them into the tops of 
the standards by the same method used in fitting the top rails of the 
foot rest of Topic 83. Their top edges should not be less than }”’ from 
the tops of the standards, so that the latter may enter the groove 
cut for them in the under side of the top.

91. Medicine cabinet. Fig. 175. 
Material: Poplar (Whitewood). 
In making this model, the top, bottom, and two sides should be made 
mee and the rabbet, shown at a, should be cut before the pieces are 
nailed together, stop- 
ping the rabbet in the 
top and bottom at 
nearly the place 
where it will intersect 
with the rabbet d of 
the sides, so that 
when the case is 
nailed together, the 
back, 6, will fit into 
both rabbets. The 
location and use of 
the various pieces 
will be seen by a 
careful study of the 
sections. 
A. Movable shelves: 
In preparing the 
ratchets, c, which 
allow the shelves to 
be placed where wanted, cut a {’’ piece the same length as the sides 
of the case, and wide enough to allow all of them to be cut from it, 
say 2}. With a sharp knife, lay out the cuts, d, across the piece, 
as shown at A, Fig. 176, marking their depth with a gauge. Make 
the cuts with a backsaw, and remove the wood between them with 
a narrow chisel. With a sharp ripsaw, cut the pieces as indicated 
by dotted lines, e, and plane them down to ?” or ;;’” uniform thick-        2   2lZ

ness. Allow wood enough to insure that there will be little danger of 
planing them too thin. The ratchets, c, Fig. 175, are placed against 
the back, 6; and the door stile, e, as indicated at the section of the side, 
at K. The cleats, j, are cut between the ratchets, c. Cut these from 
apiece about 4” wide, as indicated at F, Fig. 176, the seven dotted 
lines showing where the pieces should be ripped, after the ends, t, f, 
have been cut. They should then be planed to the same thickness 
as the ratchets, c. 
B. The door: The pieces for the door should be about {’ wider 
than needed, to allow the door to be planed to a fit after it has been

made. The stiles, especially, should be longer than needed, so that they 
may be sawed off after the door is glued up. The door may be either 
doweled or mortised together, and the glass or wood panel held in by 
the same method as in the screen. See Fig. 169. 
C. Accuracy of case and door: Care must be used, in setting up the 
case and the door, to have them both square and out of wind; the latter 
may be proved by sighting across them. If the faces of the two stiles 
of the door coincide, and the front edges of the sides of the case appear 
the same, they will be all right. 
D. Fitting the door: The door should be carefully fitted so that it 
will fall back of the front edge of the sides, or have a sinkage of about 
ts’’, as shown at s, Fig. 175, as nothing of this sort should be finished 
flush. 
E. The hinges: In cutting in hinges, the gauge is an indispensable 
tool, as a high degree of accuracy is necessary if even fairly satisfactory

  148 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
results are desired. They may be cut half into the door and half into 
the side of the case, though upon ordinary work of this nature, they 
are usually cut entirely into the door. Whichever method is used, the 
hinges should be fitted carefully against the wood. In this instance, 
there is an advantage in cutting them by the latter method, as more 
wood is obtained for the screw in the side, thus permitting a longer 
screw to be used. 
The top of the top hinge should be placed opposite the bottom of: 
the top rail, and the bottom of the bottom hinge should be placed at 
the top of the bottom rail, and both set so that about two thirds of the 
round of the hinge will project beyond the face of the door. A pair of 
14” butts will be suitable; they should be fastened on with ?’’ screws, 
which should be of a size to allow 
their heads to be driven flush with 
the inside of the hinge.

with shellac, or stain and wax to 
suit taste. 
92. Dovetailed bookrack. Fig. 
177. (See Handbook: Fig. 41.) 
Material: Oak or Poplar. 
Dovetail the pieces together as shown in the sketch; if the design 
shown is used, be sure that the curves are symmetrical. It is better, 
however, that the student make an original design for the end. When 
the model has been glued, and set away to harden, be sure that the 
ends stand square with the bottom. See Fig. 78, A. 
This model may be given a shellac finish, or stained and finished in 
wax.

corresponding mortises in the ends, following the same methods as in 
Topic 90, except that the work should be from a center line, instead 
of from a straight edge. j 
The shelves: The mortises and the grooves, or housings, for the top 
and bottom shelves should be cut in the ends, and the shelves fitted 
before the grooves are made for the middle shelves. All the shelves

as ata, Fig. 178. The student should be careful

wedges - fitted as upon 
the piano bench, care 
being taken not to cut

been made accurately, this will take care of itself. The joints of the 
shelves should be held in place by clamps while the glue is setting ; 
1}” brads should be driven through all the shelves into the ends, as 
shown at b, Fig. 178. 
94. Wood finishing. — In the following brief treatment 
of wood finishing will be found suggestions regarding 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  150 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
methods and processes which may be applied in finishing 
the models of this chapter. The workman may mix his 
own fillers, stains, etc., but he will generally find it easier 
and more satisfactory to purchase such material, made 
by. some responsible manufacturer. 
Filling: After the model has been completed, it should 
be made ready for the finish by filling the grain. If an 
open-grained wood similar to oak is to receive a shellac 
finish, it should first be well filled, after which as good a 
job may be done with two or three coats of shellac as 
with six or more without the filling. Filling is made in 
two forms: the paste, for use upon open-grained woods, 
and the liquid, which is intended for use upon such woods 
as pine, poplar, cherry, maple, ete., and which will take 
the place of one or more coats of the more expensive 
finish. Both these may be bought ready mixed, and 
colored to suit the taste by the addition of dry colors; 
or the paste may be mixed, by combining either whiting, 
silex, or corn starch, with any dry colors necessary to 
secure the desired color. To hold or bind these together, 
they should be mixed with equal quantities of boiled 
linseed oil and japan, and the whole thinned to a work- 
ing consistency by the addition of turpentine, benzine, or 
gasoline, though the paste should be as thick as is prac- 
ticable with its spreading well. 
Filling need not be spread very smoothly, but the 
surface of the wood should be covered, and the filling 
thoroughly worked into the grain. It should then be 
allowed to stand a few minutes until the filler has become 
powdery, and seems to stick to the wood when rubbed 
with the finger. It may then be rubbed off with soft 
shavings or excelsior, the rubbing crossing the grain when-
-P-A-G-E-165
  SUPPLEMENTARY MODELS 151 
ever possible. Finish it with a soft cloth. The inside 
corners should be cleaned out with a sharp-pointed stick. 
Allow the work to stand several hours or overnight be- 
fore the finish is applied; otherwise the moisture in the 
fillmg may cause the finish to blister. Liquid filling 
should be spread as smoothly and evenly as possible, or the 
laps will be apt to show when the finish is spread over it. 
95. Stains. — Stains of almost any desired color and 
composition may be purchased, but in the following par- 
agraphs an endeavor is made to explain the composition 
of a few stains which may be easily made by any one. 
In finishing open-grained woods, the wood is often 
stained and then filled, as it is thereby colored more 
evenly ; but upon general work, it is the custom to color 
the filling only. Stains for close-grained woods may be 
made by mixing dry colors with turpentine, boiled oil, 
and japan, —the same combination as the filler, except 
that the whiting is not used. A stain should be applied 
in the same way as a filler, but not allowed to become so 
hard before being wiped off, or there will be light places 
in the finish; these will also result if it is rubbed too 
hard in spots. 
A cherry stain may be made by mixing Venetian red 
with rose pink. For mahogany, add a little carmine. 
Burnt umber makes a fairly good black walnut. stain, 
but it is improved by adding a little burnt sienna. As- 
phaltum, thinned to the desired color, makes a good and 
convenient black walnut stain. 
Equal parts of permanganate of potash and sulphate 
of magnesia, dissolved in water, will make a rich brown 
stain, though it will after several years fade to a light 
brown. Better results may be obtained if the stain is
-P-A-G-E-166
  152 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
applied hot. Verdigris and indigo, mixed in hot vinegar, 
makes a good green; several coats may be necessary. 
Apply hot. A solution of logwood and sulphate of iron 
will make a good brownish black. This should also be 
applied hot. 
96. Shellac.— Shellac may be bought ready mixed, 
or may be cut by dissolving the gum in wood alcohol. 
In applying shellac finish, the wood should be first filled 
or stained; upon this, one coat is laid after another, 
each being rubbed down with pulverized pumice stone or 
No. 00 sandpaper, after which the next coat is spread. 
Upon ordinary work, two or three coats are usually suffi- 
cient, the last coat being rubbed down with sandpaper 
and oil, or with pumice stone and oil, after which it may 
be polished with a soft cloth. If a dead finish is desired, 
the final rubbing should. be done with water instead of 
oil. Shellac should be laid in thin coats, since, if applied 
thickly, it will pit badly in drying, and make trouble in 
rubbing. Use the brush with quick strokes, never work- 
ing over a place already covered, as a muddy place will 
result. 
97. Wax finish.— Wax finish may be used in almost 
any place in which shellac is suitable, though it gives 
more satisfactory results upon dark wood than upon wood 
of a light color. It may be purchased, as there are many 
good finishes of this sort upon the market. They are 
made from a secret formula, and their only point of 
superiority over the homemade finish described here, is 
that they harden more quickly. The following home- 
made wax finish is easy to make, economical, and satis- 
factory. Dissolve as much pulverized rosin as may be 
picked up on a cent in a half pint of turpentine, which 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
\ 
SUPPLEMENTARY MODELS 153. 
should be heated over a slow fire, in a water or steam 
double vessel. Allow it to simmer until it is clear, then 
add a piece of beeswax as large as a thimble, which should 
be cut into shavings, and let the mixture continue to 
simmer slowly until it becomes clear, when it is ready 
for use. This should be applied hot, with a brush, and, 
when dry, should be polished with a soft cloth; this may 
be done as often as required, each time being an improve- 
ment. 
A dark floor may receive this treatment as often as 
may be necessary. 
98. Brushes. — For stain and filling, a cheap brush 
of any suitable size will do, a flat brush generally being 
used upon ordinary work. For shellac and varnish, a 
fine brush will give better results than a coarse one; 
usually, however, it is the best practice to use as large a 
brush as the nature of the work will permit, as it will 
hold more and therefore cover more surface and show 
fewer laps. Brushes from 12” to 2” in width will be found 
satisfactory for the work of pupils and amateurs. 
The care of brushes is an important part of the work 
of those who use them, as neglect or carelessness may 
destroy a valuable brush overnight. Unless a brush is | 
to be used again soon, it should be thoroughly cleaned. : 
In cleaning a stain, filling, paint, or varnish brush, use 
benzine or turpentine; but for a shellac brush, use wood 
alcohol, cleaning all the small particles off. To obtain 
the best results, all brushes should be washed in hot, 
soapy water, and thoroughly rinsed in clean water. 7 
Shellac and, varnish brushes should not be changed from | 
one to the other unless thoroughly cleaned. Never allow 
a brush to stand upon its side for more than a few min-  
-P-A-G-E-168
  154 ELEMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION 
utes at a time, as a wrong direction is easily given the 
bristles, and a valuable brush may be quickly destroyed 
by a little carelessness or negligence. 
Old brushes, well broken in and cared for, will give 
better results than new brushes; therefore they should 
be treated with every possible consideration.

feet B. M. are there in it? i 
Nore. — Lumber is sawed to stock thicknesses at the mill, and dressed lumber 
should always be estimated as being dressed from one of the stock thicknesses, 
generally the one 3” or 3” thicker than the dressed plank which is being figured. 
The thicknesses usually sawed are $’’, 1’’, 14’, 13’, 2’, 23’, 3’, etc. Thus, a %’ 
board is sawed from 1’ stock, and 18” is taken from 1}’’ plank. 
52. A roof of 22} squares is to be shingled with shingles costing 
$2.25 per M. If 4 lb. of nails @ 4¥ per pound are used per square,

Nore. — Shingles are generally put up in bundles of 200, 250, or 500; 1000 
shingles means the equivalent of 1000 shingles 4 wide, though the shingles may 
be of any width; if the bales are full, they will measure 4000” in width per M. 
As about 25 per cent are thrown out, or wasted at the hips and valleys, it is 
customary to figure that 1000 shingles will cover a square if laid 43’’ to the weather.

VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 
By JOHN M. GILLETTE, Professor of Sociology in the 
State University of North Dakota 
$1.00 
N this volume is presented for teachers, superintendents, 
and teachers’ reading circles an illuminating discussion of 
the present general movement for vocational education. 
By this phrase is meant not only industrial education; but all 
the training courses needed to meet the practical demands of 
life. 
4] The author explains at some length the principles, de- 
mands, and methods of vocational education; he states the 
grounds upon which hopes of success may reasonably rest; 
he indicates some actual results gained by schools conducted 
on more practical lines; and he points out others which 
would follow upon the reorganization of our educational sys- 
tem in general. 
| The vocationalizing of the schools has regard to the con- 
stitution, inclination, and ability of the individual, and is in- 
tended to give him suitable training for his niche in life, to 
show him how he can make the most of himself and in what 
line he can prove himself most productive to society. At 
the same time, this scheme of education does not ignore the 
informational, the cultural, and the disciplinary aspects—it 
insists that the individual be fitted for good citizenship. 
| The introduction of vocational education into the public 
school system of the United States, with the curriculum ad- 
apted to the chief kinds of occupation belonging to each com- 
munity, will mean greater development and power for the 
country. From vocational education, introduced to meet the 
differing community needs, will result greater efficiency and 
better appreciation of the schools, increased attendance of 
pupils, greater compensation for teachers, greater productive- 
ness, higher wages, and improved society.

       AN ELEMENTARY TEXT- 
BOOK OF THEORETICAL 
MECHANICS 
By GEORGE A, MERRILL, B.S., Principal of the 
California School of Mechanical Arts, and Director of 
the Wilmerding School of Industrial Arts, San Francisco 
$1.50       
          
      
      ERRILL’S MECHANICS is intended for the upper 
classes in secondary schools, and for the two lower 
classes in college. Only a knowledge of elementary 
algebra, plane geometry, and plane trigonometry is required 
for a thorough comprehension of the work. 
4] By presenting only the most important principles and 
methods, the book overcomes many of the difficulties now 
encountered by students in collegiate courses who take up 
the study of analytic mechanics, without previously having 
covered it in a more elementary form. It treats the subject 
without the use of the calculus, and consequently does not 
bewilder- the beginner with much algebraic matter, which 
obscures the chief principles. 
| The book is written from the standpoint of the student 
in the manner that experience has proved to be the one 
most easily grasped. Therefore, beyond a constant endeavor 
to abide by the fundamental precepts of teaching, no one 
method of presentation has been used to the exclusion of 
others. The few necessary experiments are suggested and 
outlined, but a more complete laboratory course can easily be 
supplied by the instructor. 
{| The explanation of each topic is followed by a few well- 
chosen examples to fix and apply the principles involved. A 
number of: pages are devoted to the static treatment of force, 
with emphasis on the idea of action and reaction. Four- 
place tables of the natural trigonometric functions are included.

  ELEMENTS. OF 
DESCRIPTIVE GEOMETRY 
By ALBERT E. CHURCH, LL.D., late Professor of 
Mathematics, United States Military Academy, and 
GEORGE M. BARTLETT, M.A., Instructor in 
Descriptive Geometry and Mechanism, University of 
Michigan. 
$2.25 
Part I. Orthographic Projections. $1.75 
HIS is a modern treatment of descriptive geometry with 
applications to spherical projections, shades and shadows, 
perspective, and isometric projections, for the use of 
technical schools and colleges. ‘Though based upon Professor 
Church’s Descriptive Geometry, and retaining as much as 
possible the original lucidity and conciseress, this work differs 
from it quite widely. 
Among the salient features of the book are the following: 
The figures and text are included in the same volume, each 
figure being placed beside the corresponding text; General 
cases are preferred to special ones; A sufficient number of 
problems are solved in the third angle to familiarize the stu- 
dent with its use; A treatment of the profile plane of projec- 
tion is introduced; Many exercises for practice have been 
introduced; Several new problems have been added; The old 
figures have been redrawn, and many of them have been im- 
proved; Several of the more difficult elementary problems 
have been illustrated by pictorial views; In the treatment of 
curved surfaces, all problems relating to single-curved surfaces 
are taken up first, then those relating to warped surfaces, and 
finally those relating to surfaces of revolution. Experience 
proves this order to be a logical one, as the procedure is from 
the simple to the more complex. Also the student is more 
quickly prepared for work on intersections and developments.

WRITTEN AND ORAL 
COMPOSITION 
By MARTIN W. SAMPSON, Chairman of the Committee

of Education, Indiana University, formerly Head of Eng- 
lish Department, Male High School, Louisville, Kentucky.

      HE Sampson-Holland Written and Oral Composition 
is the first book to provide a complete course in composi- 
tion, both written and oral, with due stress on each part 
ofthe work. It is not a mere theoretical experiment, as many 
pioneer books are likely to be; it has been tried repeatedly, 
lesson by lesson, in actual secondary class-work, until the 
authors have felt ready to come before the educational public 
with a well-arranged, well-tried scheme. Both in theory and 
in practice, the present volume tends to strengthen English in- 
struction at its weakest point, the pupil’s use of spoken language. 
[Besides the unique feature of combining written and oral 
work, the book contains many original devices for stimulating 
the pupil’s interest in his own composition. Perhaps, too, 
no text-book on composition has ever been put together with 
a more scrupulous regard for the teacher’s own needs. The 
lessons are so planned as to distribute the written work evenly 
throughout the year, so that the task of theme-correcting is 
lightened as much as possible. The experienced teacher will 
find in the complete series of alternative lessons abundant 
opportunities to emphasize special points, and the inexperienced 
teacher will find in the specific directions for each lesson as 
definite a guide to successful teaching as a text-book alone can 
furnish. Every lesson in the book te been made to stand a 
four-fold test; its ability to meet the needs of the intelligent 
student, the dull student, the expert teacher, and the novice.

        HESE volumes correspond to the four subdivisions re- 
quired by the College Entrance Examination Board, 
and by the New York State Education Department. 
Each volume is designed for one year’s work. Each of the 
writers is a trained historical scholar, familiar with the con- 
ditions and needs of secondary schools. 
4) The effort has been to deal only with the things which 
are typical and characteristic; to avoid names and details 
which have small significance, in order to deal more justly 
with the forces which have really directed and governed man- 
kind. Especial attention is paid to social history, as well as 
to the movements of sovereigns and political leaders, 
4] The books are readable and teachable, and furnish brief 
but useful sets of bibliographies and suggestive questions. 
No pains have been spared by maps and pictures, to furnish 
a significant and thorough body of illustration, which shall 
make the narrative distinct, memorable, and clear.

COMMERCIAL GEOGRAPHY 
$1.25 
By HENRY GANNETT, Geographer of the United States Geological 
Survey and the Twelfth Census; CARL L. GARRISON, Principal 
of the Morgan School, Washington, D. C.; and EDWIN J. 
HOUSTON, -A. M., Ph.D. (Princeton), Emeritus Professor of 
Physical Geography and Physics, Central High School, Philadelphia. 
N this book commercial geography is presented in a simple, 
methodical, and logical way, to the end that its study 
shall be not only informative, but truly educative and 
worth while. The treatment is divided into three parts: 
Commercial Conditions; Commercial Products; and Com- 
mercial Countries. The first portion gives a clear, brief 
statement of the physical, social, and economic conditions 
that largely influence commerce in every region. 
4] The second part treats of the cultivation of the soil, and of 
the vegetable, animal, and mineral products that enter com- 
merce. ‘The great commercial staples are taken up separately, 
and their production, manufacture, and use described. Dia- 
grammatic maps and graphic diagrams are presented, showing 
where each staple is produced, and the percentage of the world’s 
product supplied by each of the chief contributing countries. 
| The final and largest division is devoted to a careful 
description of each of the countries of the earth with special 
reference to its industries and commerce. Maps of the 
countries indicate the location of the chief industrial centers, 
the trade routes, and the production areas. Diagrams or 
tables of imports and exports, etc., are also numerous. 
| The present condition of the world’s commerce is care- 
fully and accurately portrayed. In the text figures of abso- 
lute quantities and values have been largely avoided, because 
it is the relative rather than the absolute quantities that the 
pupil should remember. Hence the products of countries are 
usually given in percentages of the world’s total. Absolute 
quantities can easily be deduced by comparing these percent- 
ages with the tables at the close of the book.

FIRST PRINCIPLES OF 
AGRICULTURE 
By EMMET S. GOFF, late Professor of Horticulture, 
University of Wisconsin, and D, D. MAYNE, Princi- 
pal, School of Agriculture, St. Anthony Park, Minn. 
$0.80      
      
      
  UCH experience has taught that if agriculture is made 
the object of brain work, as well as of manual labor, 
better farms, and better farmers, will be produced. 
This book, therefore, is intended to present in a concise, prac- 
tical manner for pupils in elementary schools, those funda- 
mental principles upon which successful agriculture depends. 
| The farm is treated as the center of interest, and its in- 
dustries, economies, and science are discussed at some length. 
The book has been prepared with special reference both to 
simplicity and to scientific accuracy, and is based on the 
observation of the every-day facts of rural life, and on a system 
of simple experiments well within the resources of any school. 
4] The pupil is taught the reasons for the more important agri- 
cultural operations, and the explanations of the phenomena 
which accompany them. ‘The soil and vegetation are first 
taken up, including such important topics as the rotation of 
crops, parasites of plants, seed testing, animals that destroy in- 
sects, and the improvement of plants. Then follow chapters on 
dairying, live stock, poultry, bee-keeping, and the improve- 
ment of home and school yards. 
4 At the end of each chapter is a summary of what has 
been presented, furnishing in concise form definite state- 
ments for the pupil to learn, and supplying to the teacher 
a basis for drill work. An extensive appendix contains, among 
other useful information, fodder tables, a table of fertilizing 
constituents in feeding stuffs, and sections on milk testing, 
silage, contents of fields and lots, and quantities of seed 
required to the acre.

CLARK’S 
THE GOVERNMENT 
WHAT IT IS, WHAT IT DOES 
$0.75 
HIS text-book furnishes a unique presentation of the 
subject, treating of the principles of general govern- 
ment before considering those of local government. 
Its method of treatment encourages independent thought 
and personal research. ‘This appears, not only in the 
supplementary work at the end of each chapter, but also in 
the problems of government given at intervals. Maps and 
diagrams are used, besides suggestive illustrations to reinforce 
the text. 
{| Following an account of the government in general the 
book treats of the chief functions of government in a definite 
and logical manner, It then explains the American system 
of central government and the local government by the 
people; it discusses voting, State and national constitutions, 
and the relation of nation, State, county, township, and city 
to each other. The principal officials of the various govern- 
mental systems are taken up, and their duties, qualifications, 
etc., properly considered. 
{| The latter part of the book presents important chapters on 
certain practical operations of government, such as: Trials, 
law-making, party nominations, political issues, and political 
corruption. A short summary of the principles of inter- 
national law and of the commoner laws pertaining to business 
and property is also included. 
4] The author lays emphasis on the importance of State 
governments, and enriches the text with illuminating com- 
parisons with foreign governments, THe presents the subject 
as a science, a complete and sensible system of interdependent 
parts and defined limits, with a single object—the good of 
the people.

A SYSTEM OF PEDAGOGY 
By EMERSON E. WHITE, A.M., LL.D. 
Elements of Pedagogy . . 
School: Management and Moral ‘Training 
Art of Teaching . Geese ath 
Y the safe path of experience and in the light of modern 
psychology the ELEMENTS OF PEDAGOGY 
points out the limitations of the ordinary systems of 
school education and shows how their methods may be har- 
monized and coédrdinated. The fundamental principles of 
teaching are expounded in a manner which is both logical 
and convincing, and such a variety and wealth of pedagogical 
principles are presented as are seldom to be found in a single 
text-book, 
4| SCHOOL MANAGEMENT discusses school govern- 
ment and moral training from the standpoint of experience, 
observation, and study. Avoiding dogmatism, the author 
carefully states the grounds of his views and suggestions, and 
freely uses the fundamental facts of mental and moral science. 
So practical are the applications of principles, and so apt are 
the concrete illustrations that the book can not fail to be of 
interest and profit to all teachers, whether experienced or 
inexperienced. 
4] In the ART OF TEACHING the fundamental princi- 
ples are presented in a clear and helpful manner, and after- 
wards applied in methods of teaching that are generic and 
comprehensive. Great pains has been taken to show the 
true functions of special methods and to point out their limita- 
tions, with a view to prevent teachers from accepting them 
as general methods and making them hobbies. The book 
throws a clear light, not only on fundamental methods and 
processes, but also on oral illustrations, book study, class 
instruction and management, written examinations and pro- 
motions of pupils, and other problems of great importance.

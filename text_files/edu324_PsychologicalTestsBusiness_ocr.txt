PREFACE 
The chapters in this book attempt to state the main facts 
about tests, test methods, and test accomplishments, in the field 
of business. The aim throughout is to present a simple and 
impartial picture which will enable the reader to arrive at sound 
conclusions regarding the actual usefulness of tests in the business 
world, and the possibilities of future development. It is hoped 
that the material included will prove useful to anyone interested 
in the problem of more adequately adjusting men to jobs. The 
book is written for students of personnel practice and of applied 
psychology, and for all business executives who have been hearing 
the clamor about tests and who want to form a critical opinion 
on the basis of facts. 
Many of the statements of the book will seem overcautious 
to people whose hopes have run high concerning tests. But 
there is need of caution. A too enthusiastic attitude toward 
tests is bound, in the long run, to bring an unfavorable reaction. 
In some quarters it has already done so. At present it is fully 
as important to emphasize the limitations and shortcomings 
of tests as to speak in glowing terms of their possibilities. 
Some readers, too, may feel disappointed at the absence of 
concrete guidance that would enable them immediately to procure 
some tests and begin testing. The reason should, however, be 
obvious; tests are scientific instruments. Test work should be 
supervised by someone with thorough training in applied psychol- 
ogy. Otherwise it should be let alone. That is why the present 
book contains no set of tests “ready for use,” or lists of tests for 
particular purposes. As patent medicines, tests are dangerous.

CHAPTER I 
THE NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS 
Ever since men first began to have dealings with one another, 
they have endeavored to find successful ways of predicting one 
another’s conduct. Earlier generations laid much stress on the 
effort to detect, through signs and portents, those supernatural 
forces and mysterious influences which were regarded as the chief 
determiners of the course of one’s life. Later generations have 
turned their attention to the tendencies to action found within 
man himself, which we call variously “capacities,” “abilities,” 
“traits of character,” “habits,” ‘dispositions,’ and the like. 
Such tendencies in an individual we can learn to understand 
through close association with him and observation of his actions 
under varying conditions; and we use such an understanding 
of him as the basis for judging how he may be expected to act 
in the future. 
But not often is this prolonged, intimate observation of an 
individual possible. We are constantly compelled to make 
judgments about people’s abilities without having opportunity 
for long acquaintance. Especially is this true in selecting 
workers for employment, but it is no less true and no less serious 
a problem in many other fields of human activity. Many 
methods are in daily use and many others have been advocated 
for judging abilities and predicting behavior with accuracy. 
In psychological tests we find one of the most recent and one 
of the most popular proposals for accomplishing these purposes. 
RECENCY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS 
It is now more than a third of a century since tests were first 
devised and used in psychological laboratories. But it is only

2 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
within still more recent years that they have begun to attract 
general attention. The work of the French psychologist, 
Alfred Binet, during the first and second decades of this century 
probably did as much as anything to stimulate the present wave 
of popular interest. The first really influential suggestion toward 
utilizing tests in industry came from Hugo Miinsterberg in 1913. 
The use of psychological tests on an extensive scale dates from 
the work of American psychologists in the army camps during 
1917-18. The testing movement is still in its infancy. 
~But in spite of their newness, psychological tests are today 
enjoying unprecedented popularity. The term “mental test” 
has come to play an extraordinary réle in popular speech. News- 
papers print “memory tests” daily. Monthly magazines contain 
frequent articles pertaining to tests and their use. Many people 
without psychological training, and almost everybody, it seems, 
with psychological training, are devising, using, or experimenting 
with tests of various sorts, or at least criticizing them. It is 
not surprising that the skeptic cries out, ‘Fad!’ But the 
demonstrated success of tests in many directions shows that they 
are no mere fad. Today psychological tests are being success- 
fully used for practical purposes in a wide variety of fields. 
Schools, colleges, universities, vocational guidance bureaus, 
courts, reformatories, public-welfare agencies, physicians, the 
army, business men—these and others are using them, and new 
uses are being suggested almost daily. 
Naturally, the serious adoption of tests for so wide a variety 
of purposes is gratifying to the psychologist. It is a testimonial 
to the practical worth and the growing influence of his science. 
However, there is another side to it. Most psychologists are 
seriously concerned about the danger of overselling tests to the 
public. They know that the uncritical enthusiast, with his 
extravagant claims and unscientific practices, may be the 
worst enemy of the testing movement. Tests, carelessly prepared 
or hastily selected by incompetent testers, may lead to disappoint-
-P-A-G-E-13
THE NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS 3 
ing results and the inevitable reaction. An uncritical popular 
attitude, whether for or against tests, psychologists dread. 
They would have every business man take a genuinely scientific 
attitude toward tests—open-minded, yet critical. The business 
man has learned to intrust his other technical problems to experts 
who are competent by training and experience to handle the 
intricate issues involved. Psychologists would have him do 
the same with his problems of personnel selection and mainte- 
nance—problems not one whit less technical. 
WHAT IS A PSYCHOLOGICAL TEST? 
But, after all, what is a psychological test? What sort of a 
thing is this device, so popular and promising, and yet so liable 
to misuse? A brief and at the same time complete answer is 
impossible. A psychological test may assume any one of 
countless forms. Almost any kind of a task may be used for a 
test, so long as it.can be used to give a_reliable indication of an 
individual’ ability or to predict with accuracy his futur 
“ance, The test may require him to answer a series of questions 
or solve a number of problems, and his score will be the number 
he answers correctly. He may be required to sort, arrange, or 
mark a series of objects in specified fashion, and we may score 
him in terms of the time required to perform the task. Or a 
sample of his work—handwriting, composition, or manual 
construction—produced under prescribed conditions, may be 
graded as to its quality by comparison with a graded series of 
standard samples. Any of these—speed, accuracy, quality, or 
some combination of these—may serve as the basis on which we 
measure his performance, and provide the terms in which we 
express numerically his score. 
The principle of the psychological test is, then, to use a 
sample of one’s ‘behavior to indicate his abilities or other tenden- 
cies, and hence to predict his probable future behavior. This is 
indeed the basic principle ‘of any sort of test, “psychological or      
  
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  4 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
otherwise—measuring a representative sample for the purpose 
of predicting what other samples are likely to be. The grain 
buyer does not need to examine each grain in a carload of wheat, 
nor does the structural engineer need to measure the strength 
of every beam that goes into a building. Having assured himself 
that the sample of grain or the single beam is typical of the rest, 
he grades or tests that sample and pins his faith to the uniformity 
and constancy of the conditions which produced those results. 
Similarly, when we give a typing test, a cancellation test, or an 
intelligence test to an individual, we assume that the internal 
conditions which determined his score on the sample are so 
constant that we can rely on his doing likewise under any similar 
conditions. The test then is given for purposes of prediction. 
WHERE ARE TESTS BEING USED? 
1. Elementary education.—The grade schools were among the 
earliest and most active users of psychological tests. It was in 
their interest that Binet devised the first successful general 
intelligence scale. Tests of this and other types have multiplied 
rapidly in number and usefulness. With their aid pupils can 
be quickly classified into groups according to ability. Instruc- 
tion can thus be better adapted to children of different grades 
of ability, and individual progress at the most favorable rate 
encouraged. Various grades and types of mental defectives 
can be picked out and assigned to special classes, schools, or 
institutions, where they can have better care and training. 
Pupils who are “problems” can be diagnosed with the aid of 
different kinds of tests, and appropriate methods of treatment, 
either educational, disciplinary, social, or medical, prescribed. 
Specially gifted children can be discovered and given suitable 
opportunities for development. On the basis of test results 
pupils can be more intelligently advised how to choose studies 
and occupations. Recent years have seen a rapid increase in 
educational tests which measure achievement in arithmetic,
-P-A-G-E-15
  
THE NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS 5 
handwriting, reading, language, and other school subjects. 
These, which are really varieties of psychological tests, make pos- 
sible the more accurate estimation of the school progress of indi- 
viduals. This ia turn makes possible the measurement of the com- 
parative efficiency of different teachers, schools, and school 
systems. 
2. Higher education.—High schools, colleges, and universities 
are also actively using tests. By their aid students can be 
classified and assigned to appropriate classes and sections, causes 
of failure analyzed, and educational or vocational counsel given. 
Some higher institutions are even using them as a primary or 
supplementary method of deciding which applicants for admis- 
sion have sufficient ability to profit by college training. 
3. Vocational guidance.—Bureaus, organized to guide young 
people in their choice of an occupation, have long been interested 
in the possibilities of tests as one means of discovering individual 
aptitudes, and thus of advising the youth in what occupations 
he has a reasonable chance of success, as well as what occupations 
he should not consider. In those bureaus which have made 
testing a part of their regular program, probably the chief value 
of tests thus far has-been.a_negative-one—to-show_pupils-what 
occupations they should not choose.. With the development of 
testing and of vocational information we may expect the uses 
of tests to become more positive and more specific, as well as 
more common. 
4. Public-welfare agencies.—Many different agencies, public 
and private, are engaged in studying cases of poverty, delin- 
quency, and crime. Often they find in psychological tests 
useful instruments to aid in discovering the causes of social 
maladjustments, and thus in determining appropriate treatment. 
Some reformatories and prisons are accumulating in this way 
large bodies of information which will help us to find out how 
important a factor low intelligence or other measurable mental 
abnormalities are in causing crime, and how, therefore, our   
     
-P-A-G-E-16
  6 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
treatment of individual criminals may be made more rational. 
Juvenile courts and other courts are using tests to determine 
how far individual offenders can be held responsible for their 
misdeeds, and what procedure in each case is wisest. Social 
case-workers find low mentality a common cause of poverty 
and misery, and are enabled to recommend corrective or relief 
measures which are better adapted to individual conditions. 
5. Medicine —The physician in an increasing degree looks to 
psychology to contribute methods of diagnosing disorders and 
defects of what he calls a functional character. Psychological 
tests and examinations, therefore, are playing an important 
role in the procedure of many specialists. 
6. Army.—The successful testing of 1,750,000 men in the 
United States Army demonstrated the value of tests for such 
military purposes as picking out the mentally unfit, equalizing 
military units as to ability, and selecting men of superior general 
ability or of special trade proficiencies for certain tasks. 
7. Business.—Large-scale industry, with its highly specialized 
occupations and functions, and its growing recognition of the 
importance of the human factor, is coming more and more to 
centralize its employment functions in the hands of those who 
themselves are not experts in the occupations for which they 
select workers, but who are specialists in problems of employment 
and labor management. This condition calls in increasing 
measure for standardized methods by which peculiar aptitudes 
or proficiencies can readily be discovered and directed into those 
channels which are most profitable for the employer and most 
promising for the worker. It is this field—the use of psycho- 
logical tests in business, and particularly in employment selec- 
tion—with which the present volume is concerned. 
In spite of the wide and rapid extension of the testing move- 
ment to the various fields we have named, we must not over- 
estimate the extent to which it has advanced. Even among 
schools, where the usefulness of tests is most clearly apparent,
-P-A-G-E-17
  THE NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS a 
there are undoubtedly more institutions where a standard test 
has never been seen, nor perhaps even heard of, than there are 
institutions which have ever thought of using them. In business, 
probably only a fraction of x per cent of American industrial 
and commercial establishments have ever seriously tried to use 
standardized tests, and in very.few of these have they passed 
beyond the experimental stage. Of the thousands of different 
specialized occupations only a few have been analyzed from this 
standpoint, and in only a handful of these can we say with 
assurance that completely satisfactory tests have been found. 
Nevertheless, the outlook is emphatically favorable to tests. 
While many business men are skeptics on the question, and a 
great many more would admit that they don’t know enough 
about tests even to be skeptics, many have been “sold” on 
the idea. 
TESTS AND EMPLOYMENT SELECTION 
~~ As has been suggested, the use of psychological tests in 
business has been confined almost altogether to the selecting of 
applicants for employment or to assigning them to jobs. This is 
by no means the only possible use of tests in business. They may 
be of value for measuring the increase in proficiency of workers 
already employed, perhaps in connection with a training program. 
They may conceivably be used, either alone or in connection 
with other methods, for selecting workers for special purposes, 
such as promotion, transfer, or lay-off. But our discussion will 
center principally in the use of tests for selecting workers and for 
placing workers in positions for which they are, by native 
capacity, training, and temperament, best fitted to render 
service of maximum value. 
The use of tests for such purposes may be described as an 
effort to put “the right man in the right place.” The desirability 
of such a condition needs no emphasis. Everyone knows how 
unsatisfactory are present conditions. No one in particular can 
be blamed for it; it is one of the by-products of modern life and
-P-A-G-E-18
  8 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
modern business. Probably the majority of adults feel that 
they are misfits in their life-work. How often do we hear the 
expression, “I could have done much better in some other 
occupation.”’ Such a situation is a loss, both to employer and 
employee, and therefore to community and nation. A staff of 
workers ill fitted for the work they have to do means low quantity 
and poor quality of output. It means discontent, industrial 
unrest, wasted time, and friction. It means high cost of produc- 
tion and of labor replacement. For the employee, it means 
being tied down to tasks that are difficult and disagreeable. 
It means mediocre pay and slow or no progress. It means 
chronic dissatisfaction and all the harmful consequences, personal 
and social, that come from such a condition. 
To use physiological and psychological tests to avert such 
loss is not altogether a novel proposal. For a long time railroad 
and steamship companies have been testing engineers and 
navigation officers for color-blindness, since inability to dis- 
tinguish signal lights invites certain disaster. To hire an 
employee to operate a high-speed machine, who has not the 
nervous or. motor capacity necessary to enable him ever to keep up 
the pace required, may not be socially so disastrous, but it is none 
the less unprofitable for the employer and unfair to the worker. 
The wise use of the proper tests in the beginning would prevent 
such mistakes, and thé employee could be put at a task suited 
to his capacities where he would be both happier and more 
useful. 
JOB REQUIREMENTS AND INDIVIDUAL QUALIFICATIONS 
The use of tests for vocational selection involves two funda- 
mental principles: First, the great variability of job require- 
ments; and second, the great variability of personal qualifications. 
The former has been on the increase ever since division and 
specialization of human labor began. A man may be eminently 
fitted for one job by the very personal make-up that totally 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
THE NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS 9 
disqualifies him for another. Hence, a first step in the selection 
of workers for any job, whether by tests or any other method, 
is to ascertain the abilities and traits which that job demands. 
This usually means some sort of a job analysis of that task. 
By a job analysis is meant a systematic investigation of the 
duties, operations, methods, conditions of work, qualifications, 
prospects, etc., of each job in an establishment. How detailed 
this must be depends on varying conditions, including the purpose 
for which analysis is made. Where the purpose is the devising 
or selection of tests, it may perhaps be very informal. But some 
familiarity with the job’s demands must be gained, for we 
cannot decide whether a worker fits until we know what it is 
he has to fit. 
But of greater direct interest to us is the fact of individual 
variability. If people were all cast in the same mold, there would 
be no need of tests or other selective devices; knowing one, we 
should know all. But individuals are not all alike. From 
whatever point of view we compare and measure them they are 
found to vary widely. When a group is measured as to any one 
particular trait, a few individuals will be found to manifest that 
trait in an exceptionally high degree. A few others will be found 
almost or completely lacking in that trait. Most will be 
found to reveal it in some degree between these extremes. 
Such variability characterizes any trait we care to name, 
whether physical or mental. It is a commonplace that no two 
people look exactly alike. It is no less true that no two people 
are precisely alike in any other trait, hereditary or acquired, 
although the differences between them may range from infini- 
tesimal to great. Human traits are, moreover, practically 
countless in their number and diversity. The farther we carry 
our analysis of human personality the more numerous become 
the specific habits, abilities, and dispositions which we may 
enumerate, and which may contribute, positively or negatively, 
to vocational fitness. When we multiply by several hundred  
-P-A-G-E-20
  10 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
or several thousand such highly specialized traits as “ability to 
add quickly long columns of three- or four-digit numbers,” or 
“tendency to use caution in approaching a grade crossing when 
driving a motor truck,” we begin to realize the tremendous com- 
plexity of the problem of testing all—or even the most impor- 
tant—traits which may be of vocational significance. 
Qne of the commonest mistakes in interpreting the results 
of tests arises from the failure to recognize.adequately..this.rich 
“diversity of human traits. It is easy to assume that because 
an individual ranks low on a general intelligence test he must 
therefore be of low ability in every direction. True, he may be. 
Psychologists do not take much stock in Emerson’s Law of 
Compensation. But psychologists do recognize that inferior 
ability in one direction not infrequently goes hand in hand with 
superior ability in other directions. There are and must be 
many kinds of tests—far more than we have today—if we are to 
measure all aspects of human nature. 
Let us note, in passing, that measuring these traits by no 
means implies placing a corresponding moral or social valuation 
on them. Superior scores and inferior scores refer primarily 
to amount, not to value. Whether high scores are or are not 
desirable—and they may be either—depends on the purpose for 
which we would use them. 
DISTRIBUTION TABLES AND CURVES 
It is most useful when attempting to measure any of these 
traits in a group of people to reduce them to quantitative terms 
and to show the distribution of the various degrees either in a 
distribution table or a distribution curve. As an illustration 
of these two ways we may show (p. 11) the scores made by 367 
pupils of the same school grade on an intelligence test. 
It is evident that to say of a pupil, “He is in such and such 
a school grade” tells little or nothing about his degree of intel- 
ligence. One pupil will be able to solve several times as many
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS II 
of the problems in an intelligence test as another in the same 
grade. Certainly, no one expects the same performance in 
school work of these two. If their relative ability remains 
constant, we need not expect the same performance of these two

when they enter business. One will be able to meet with com- 
parative ease difficult situations in which the other will be 
utterly at sea. A distribution table or curve for any other of 
the hundreds of psychological traits we might name would show 
similar form. 
Certain other facts about the distribution of individual 
abilities can be pointed out. When we measure the individual 
heights of a thousand men we find that their measurements do
-P-A-G-E-22
  12 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
not fall into sharply distinguishable classes—so many exactly 
66 inches, so many exactly 67 inches, and so on. The measure- 
ments shade into one another by imperceptible degrees; they 
are continuous, not discrete. The same thing holds true for 
any trait, physical or mental, we want to measure. Ordinarily 
this is not a matter of serious concern, but if we try to classify 
people into a few distinct classes, we find it a very difficult 
_task, since this co’ nature of individual differences com- 
pels _us_to put in one class people who are hardly perceptibly 
lower than those we put in the class above. Making distinctions 
under such conditions—particularly when dealing with traits 
of social importance—is often distasteful, though unavoidable. 
We can point out still another characteristic of these measure- 
ments. While they cover a wide range, they are not distributed 
uniformly from high to low, but tend to concentrate around the 
average. That is, most men are neither tall nor short, but of 
about average height. A smaller number are noticeably above 
or below the average. Still fewer are extremely tall or extremely 
short. Likewise with intelligence, or any other trait, as shown 
in the distribution curve just presented. The majority are of 
medium intelligence; a smaller number are bright or dull. 
A very few are exceptionally bright or exceptionally dull, includ- 
ing feeble-minded. This bell-shaped curve is the most common 
form of distribution of any trait. If we use large enough numbers 
of individuals and make our units of measurement fine enough, 
the distribution curve tends to become smoother and more 
truly bell-shaped in appearance, revealing clearly the continuous 
nature of the distribution. But for smaller numbers, of course, 
chance variations will be proportionately magnified and our curve 
will take a less regular form. 
  INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY AND VOCATIONAL SELECTION 
The importance of this fact of individual variability for 
employment selection should now be clear. Of the applicants
-P-A-G-E-23
  THE NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS 13 
who present themselves for employment in a given job, not 
all will possess in adequate degree the various physical and 
mental characteristics essential for satisfactory work in that 
job. If it is an easy one, perhaps all but a few may possess the 
necessary degree of ability, and the problem will be to discover 
those few and to refuse to employ them for work in which they 
would probably fail. On the other hand, the work may be 
of such exacting character that only a few will possess the 
necessary traits in sufficient degree to make their success 
reasonably assured, and the problem will be to find these indi- 
viduals. 
Some of these traits are primarily products of heredity. 
Others have definitely been acquired through training or experi- 
ence. Most, if not all, involve something of both these influences. 
But to know their precise origin, while it would be interesting, 
is probably of less practical importance for our present purpose 
than it is to comprehend their nature, to be able to measure 
their degree, and to know how to utilize, control, and modify 
them. 
We can see now that the notion of vocational selection as 
“fitting the square pegs into square holes and the round pegs 
into round holes” is an inadequate statement of the problem. 
People are not like pegs of a few standard shapes. They do not 
fall into a few fixed types. If each person possesses a practically 
unlimited number of traits, and if each of these may exist in any 
degree from zero to maximum, the possible varieties of indi- 
viduals are seen to be infinite. There are as many types as there 
are individuals; or if you prefer, there is only the one type—the 
human—-and all individuals are variants from that type. Like- 
wise, job demands are almost as varied as are people. Voca-

TESTS AND OTHER METHODS OF JUDGING MEN IN BUSINESS 
A test of course is not the only device for discovering and 
measuring useful personal characteristics. Long and intimate 
acquaintance with a man is, after all, the surest way to tell 
what he is. But in employing men this is rarely practicable. 
Asa rule, we have to depend on clues which are at best imperfect 
and partial indicators of character and ability. Different 
employers place reliance upon one or another of many supposed 
indications of personality. Among them may be mentioned 
letters of application, recommendations or references, school 
records, personal appearance, dress and manners, handwriting 
quality or handwriting peculiarities, answers to questions, 
facial characteristics, photographs, impressions made during 
interviews, and other devices. In so far as these can be proved 
to afford genuine indications of character and ability, they are, 
of course, valuable and should be utilized. Some of them afford 
a more or less direct expression of significant tendencies. But 
others bear only an indirect, remote, or chance relationship to 
the traits sought. School records often prove to be to some 
extent indicative of vocational fitness. The interview is com- 
monly regarded as indispensable, although it makes a difference 
what the interview comprises. Some interviewers lay stress 
on “first impressions,” gained from the applicant’s demeanor, 
appearance, dress, carriage, voice, mode of speech, and general 
responsiveness, while others depend more on information elicited 
through questioning. General letters of recommendation carry 
far less weight now than formerly, but confidential replies to 
direct inquiries are usually regarded as valuable—how valuable 
depends on how definite and objective the inquiries and answers 
are. Similarly, the value of formal, written applications depends 
on the definiteness and relevance of the information they yield. 
Some employers pin their faith to some system of character 
analysis, either their own or a commercialized system, based 
on peculiarities of handwriting or of facial characteristics.
-P-A-G-E-25
  THE NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS 15 
But both experience and experiment show that all these 
methods are subject to error, and opinions based on them may 
be misleading. But so, indeed, are some of those based on tests. 
Why then should we use tests? Because they show promise of 
being less subject to error and less “misleading 1g than the tradi- 
tional methods of judging applicants. ‘The special strength of 
tests lies in the fact that they are standardized and more or less 
“fool-proof” instruments, the actual value of which in any given 
case can readily be discovered. We do not have to use them on 
faith. Nor do we have to try to prove their worth by the very 
questionable expedient so many system-makers use—citing.a few 
favorable instances and ignoring all the cases that fail to support 
our pet theory. Since test scores are expressed in numerical 
terms, we can determine by computation just how accurately 
they indicate the abilities we want to measure. Thus we are in 
a position to gradually try out, revise, and improve our tests 
until we reach a satisfactory degree of reliability. We should 
not summarily reject other methods, but endeavor to submit 
them to the same sort of critical evaluation to which every good 
standardized test is submitted. Tests then are not to be regarded 
as an exclusive method of vocational selection, but potentially as 
a most valuable supplement to other employment methods. 
STANDARDIZED AND UNSTANDARDIZED TESTS 
A psychological test is by no means unique. It is a refinement 
of methods we are crudely using every day. When a layman 
is first introduced to a psychological test he may be surprised 
that it is so simple, and may think he could go ahead and devise 
one himself. Doubtless he could. In fact, a great many people 
with no psychological training have tried it. But whether 
the product will have any value is another matter. Anybody 
can take a stick and put marks along its length, but whether 
these marks mean inches or centimeters or nothing in particular 
is another question. Anybody can prepare a list of questions or
-P-A-G-E-26
  16 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
set down a number of problems of the sort he has seen in some 
test, but if these are not standardized nobody can tell what 
any given response to them means, except in terms of his own 
subjective opinions. For anyone else they are worthless. 
An ambitious but untrained amateur sets out to devise a test 
for a given occupation. He prepares a series of 100 questions 
and announces that 90 per cent answered correctly shall be 
regarded as passing. Then a technically trained tester happens 
along and begins to quiz him, asking such questions as: 
Are these questions worded absolutely unambiguously? How do you 
know? 
Are they all of equal—or accurately graded—difficulty, so that one 
means as much, and should mean as much, in the score as any other? 
Is there a fixed time limit? Why? Or why not? If so, is it made 
and kept absolutely uniform whenever the test is given? 
Will a slow reader or a slow writer make a lower score than one who reads 
or writes rapidly? If so, is it a trade test or a reading-writing test ? 
Will any subject be certain to get the same score, no matter who gives 
the test? How do you know? 
Will he be certain to get the same score, no matter who marks it? 
Is there any way in which a generous marker can score him higher than 
a hard marker could? If not, how has this personal element been 
eliminated ? 
Has the test itself been tested? 
Why is 90 set as the passing mark? Did you decide arbitrarily? If 
so, what proof of the correctness of this figure have you? Did you decide 
by taking the test yourself? If so, what evidence have you that your 
performance is the correct standard? Or did you try it on a group of 
workers ? 
How many workers have you tested with it? Is this enough to con- 
stitute a reliable sample ? 
How did you pick out these workers? At random, or did you select 
cases favorable for your purpose ? 
Did the successful workers all score 90 or above? The poor workers 
89 or below? If not, do you know how reliable it is in separating these 
groups ? 
How did you determine which are “good” and which “poor” workers ? 
Was that a reliable method ?
-P-A-G-E-27
  THE NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS 17 
Is this test available so that other people can try it out under precisely 
similar conditions and compare their results reliably with yours? Are your 
tesults available for such comparison ? 
The well-meaning amateur has perhaps never thought of 
some of these things at all, or he cannot give answers that prove 
the test score to be a reliable, valid, and accurately interpretable 
sample measurement. True, even a standardized test may not 
rank A+ on all these points. But if the test-maker knows 
how close to reliability it is, that is worth a great deal. ; 
~ Such considerations distinguish the standardized psychological 
test from one which is nothing more than “somebody’s guess.” 
To work out and establish a sound technique, to obtain accurate 
norms for comparison and interpretation of test results, and to 
determine the validity and reliability of a test—these demand 
thorough psychological and statistical training on the part of 
the test-maker. His psychological training suggests to him, 
in the light of what he knows about human behavior, the sort of 
material and method of presenting it which will call forth the 
traits he wants to measure. It aids him in finding standards, 
against which to check up his beliefs about what the test 
measures. It makes him keenly alert to countless sources of 
error, unsuspected by the layman, which complicate psychological 
experimentation. It shows him how to guard against these 
errors. It helps him to understand the real significance of high 
or low test scores. His statistical training teaches him how to 
work out many details of technique; how to ascertain the validity 
and reliability of the test; how and where to get comparative 
standards or norms; and how to express these norms so as to 
permit accurate comparisons. 
CLASSES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS 
Perhaps it will help us to get a clearer notion of the nature 
of psychological tests, as well as to appreciate their infinite 
variety, if we try to classify them in various ways. Any classifi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  18 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
cation, we should remember, is no more than a convenience. 
It cannot be a rigidly mechanical affair, since there are literally 
hundreds of different standardized tests, all of which differ in 
some detail from every other, and consequently no two of 
which measure exactly the same thing. From whatever stand- 
point we choose to group them, there will be some tests whose 
nature is such that we would be equally justified in including 
them in any of two or more groups. With these precautions, 
let us proceed. The simplest way of classifying tests is into 
(x) individual tests, and (2) group tests. The earliest tests were 
mainly of the first sort, designed to be given to one person at a 
time. Group tests are more recent and involve a somewhat 
different technique. Indeed, the first widely used group intelli- 
gence test was that used in the United States Army in 1917-18. 
It is harder to maintain uniform controlled conditions with fifty 
subjects at a time than it is with one. Nevertheless, the great 
economy of being able to test from fifty to five hundred people 
in the same time it takes to test one has led to the rapid multipli- 
cation of group tests during the past few years. 
Another possible basis for classification is in terms of the 
form of response which the conditions of the test call for. These 
may be either (1) oral responses, (2) writing or marking, or 
(3) performance of any other sort. While individual tests may 
utilize any or all of these types of response, group tests usually 
necessitate writing or checking. Since people vary in their 
normal speed of writing, it is usually desirable to eliminate this 
complicating factor by having the subject respond by underlining 
or making a check mark opposite one of several alternative 
responses printed in the test. While all non-verbal tests may 
be classified as performance tests, it is hardly worth while to 
subdivide these, since, as will appear later, the kind of perform- 
ance called for varies with every test. 
We could, if we chose, classify tests as to their use, as 
(x) educational, (2) industrial, (3) clinical, (4) military, and
-P-A-G-E-29
THE NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS 19 
(5) social. But the value of such a classification disappears when 
we notice that many tests may be used equally well for several 
purposes. The army Alpha test, for example, has been widely 
used for every one of the previously mentioned purposes. 
CLASSES OF TEST ORGANIZATION 
Tests may be classified as to their form of organization, 
namely: (1) single tests, (2) test groups, and (3) scales. The 
second and third classes refer to groups of simpler tests, used 
either to get supplementary measures of the trait being tested, 
or to test a more complex trait, or perhaps to test a group of 
more or less closely related traits. Test groups differ from what 
are sometimes designated as “scales,” in that the latter combine 
the scores of the separate tests into a single figure—a composite 
or one-dimensional score—while in the test group we record the 
scores of the separate tests of the group separately, thus affording 
a more analytical, multi-dimensional description of the subject’s 
performance. 
Test groups (which, of course, means something quite other 
than group tests) are of diverse character, and a further word 
about the forms they take may not be amiss. Some of them are 
referred to as profile tests. Thus the Downey will-profile test 
measures twelve distinct volitional or temperamental tendencies, 
and the twelve separate scores are graphically recorded in such 
a way that the line connecting them depicts the individual’s 
will-profile. Still another example of grouping tests is the 
battery of tests which the employment psychologist finds by 
experiment are measures of the traits necessary for a specific 
occupation. While one may prefer to combine, according to 
some formula, the separate scores of such a battery into a single 
figure, thus making a scale of it, he may, on the other hand, 
prefer to reveal, instead of to conceal, the scores on the separate 
tests and use the profile, test-group, or analytical method of 
describing a subject’s performance. Seashore’s series of tests  
-P-A-G-E-30
  20 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
for the various elements entering into musical aptitude exempli- 
fies this latter procedure. 
While other possible classifications of tests might be suggested, 
we shall mention only one more, for many purposes the most 
suggestive. This is in terms of the kinds of ability or tendency 
the tests attempt to measure. 
FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF TESTS 
1. Tests of proficiencies

6) Trade tests 
2. Tests of aptitudes 
a) General aptitude tests 
(1) General intelligence tests 
(2) Mechanical aptitude tests 
6) Special aptitude tests 
(x) Physical tests 
(2) Motor tests 
(3) Sensory tests 
(4) Tests of other special mental functions 
3. Tests of character and temperament traits 
With these various classes of tests and the traits they seek to 
measure, the rest of this chapter will be concerned. 
As has been pointed out, those characteristics which the tester 
measures are almost countless in number and variety. Human 
ability is not a single, unitary thing, but a vast complex of 
separate abilities. We cannot hope to get at all aspects of human 
ability by a single test. We can measure only one phase at a 
time. To get at every phase would necessitate more kinds of 
tests than have yet been devised. Some of these phases we 
designate as “proficiencies” of various kinds, others as “apti- 
tudes,” still others, for want of a better term, we loosely call 
“traits of character,” “temperament,” and “‘personality.” 
When we speak of proficiencies we are thinking of items of 
knowledge and skill in some well-organized field—a trade, or 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  THE NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS 21 
a school subject—which have been acquired through definite 
training and experience. Ability to write a good business 
letter, to take and transcribe dictation, to operate a lathe or 
dynamo, to speak French, and to perform a thousand and one 
other skilled acts—these are definite proficiencies. 
Aptitudes refer to specific human capacities which have not 
been systematically developed toward definite ends, but the 
possession of which enables one to acquire with reasonable 
training the proficiency desired. They are potentialities of 
proficiency. Most, it is true, have had some casual development 
in the course of daily life, but not in the form in which we wish 
to use them. One who has never seen a typewriter may never- 
theless be proved, by proper tests, to have superior motor and 
mental aptitudes for this kind of activity, so that with proper 
training we know he can acquire a satisfactory typing proficiency. 
One’s particular physical aptitudes, sensory aptitudes, motor 
aptitudes, and intellectual aptitudes, in their countless mutations, 
help to determine what special items of skill and knowledge 
one can profitably undertake to acquire. 
Still other phases of behavior—we refer to them variously 
as habits of character, emotional and temperamental tendencies, 
volitional qualities, traits of personality, etc——can hardly be 
classified either as aptitudes or proficiencies, since they indicate 
not so much abilities to act, as natural or habitual levels of acting. 
A test for honesty, for example, would endeavor to measure 
not how honest a person could be if he tried, but how honest he 
habitually is. The importance of such tests for many purposes, 
we can readily see, is so great that any successful tests of these 
phases of behavior would be very useful in a great variety of 
ways. 
A functional classification must be even less rigid than those 
which have been given before. Often we cannot be sure which 
of several functions is being measured. Thus, when we think 
we are measuring general intelligence, we may really be in part
-P-A-G-E-32
  22 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
measuring the subject’s proficiency in reading the instructions. 
A moral judgment test is likely to be more a test of intelligence 
than of morality. A low score on some intellectual test like 
color-naming or letter-canceling may prove, on further investiga- 
tion, to be really due to some sensory or motor defect. Some- 
times what we are testing varies with the way in which we conduct 
the test. If we ask a subject to name the colors of several 
objects, it may really be a test of his knowledge of color names 
instead of a test of his color sensitivity. Hence, we test color- 
blindness by handing him several skeins of colored yarns, 
asking him to select those which resemble in color certain stand- 
ard skeins, and we avoid mentioning color names. It follows, 
then, that the significance of any test must not be obscured by 
attaching the wrong name to it, such as color-blindness, instead 
of color-naming. Some even go so far as to advocate using no 
test names which imply particular mental processes. 
TESTS OF PROFICIENCIES 
Educational tests—There are two classes of situations in 
which we most often demand of individuals the attainment of a 
certain body of organized knowledge and skill—the school and 
the trade. Proficiency tests have been in daily use in both these 
fields ever since teachers began examining their pupils and masters 
began examining their workmen. But it is only recently that 
these examinations have been standardized, so that we can be 
sure the tests are reasonably valid and results widely comparable. 
Today, for almost every elementary and secondary school 
subject there are available one or more standardized tests. An 
idea of their number and scope may be gained from the following 
list (p. 23), taken from a recent bibliography. 
While of course such tests are meant primarily for schools, 
it is readily apparent that many of them may have value for 
employment purposes, particularly for office jobs.

Trade tests—Trade tests have been worked out for special 
kinds of work in a few industries, and for a few standard occupa- 
tions, such as stenographers, typists, and general office clerks. 
These are usually standardized samples of the work done in 
the trade. We must distinguish clearly between these and the 
special aptitude tests which will be described later, and which 
are used for industrial selection. The latter are not trade tests, 
even though they relate to certain trades. The trade test is a 
test designed to measure not merely the aptitude for acquiring 
a trade, but the actually learned skill and knowledge involved 
in that trade. Trade tests can be of wide general use only when 
the specific items of knowledge and skill implied by the test are 
everywhere uniform, not limited to the practices of a single 
institution or even a single community.
-P-A-G-E-34
  
  24 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
The most conspicuous achievement in the trade test field is 
the group of trade tests devised for the United States Army. 
During 1918 tests for eighty-three trades were devised and 
standardized by the trade test division and used in various 
army camps for selecting those men who had the necessary 
trade ability—knowledge and skill—necessary in a great military 
organization. As examples of trades for which such tests were 
devised might be mentioned auto repairer (general test, and four 
subtrade tests), baker and cook, office clerk, electrician (five 
tests), stable boss, machinist and mechanic (twelve tests), printing 
trades (four tests), sheet metal worker (two tests), telegraph and 
wireless operator, and many others. 
These tests were standardized in industrial plants and were 
designed to be administered and scored by officers who themselves 
were wholly unfamiliar with the trade in question. They were 
arranged to reveal four grades of trade ability—novice, 
apprentice, journeyman, and expert—and were brief enough to 
meet the demand for economy of time. 
Three general types of trade tests were used: (a) the oral- 
question test, (b) the picture-question test, and (c) the perform- 
ance test. The first type, which was the most common, com- 
prised questions pertaining to the trade which could be, as a 
tule, correctly answered in only one way, and by a single word or 
brief phrase. This permitted scoring each answer unequivocally 
as right or wrong—a very important technical detail. As an 
example, among the fifteen questions in the ‘“ Bricklayer-General” 
test occur the following: 
Q. What are headers used for in a brick wall?

Q. In setting a sill course how much pitch do you give it?

-P-A-G-E-35
  THE NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS 25 
As the maximum possible score is 60, a score of 53 or above 
gives an expert rating; 44 to 52, a journeyman rating; 13 to 43, 
an apprentice rating. 
In the picture tests, used for cobblers, general carpenters, 
storage-battery electricians, etc., pictures of tools, processes, 
objects, or parts were shown and the questions referred specifically 
to these. In the performance tests—for example, truck driver, 
inside wireman, steamfitter, etc.—a representative, though 
usually brief, task was set, a standard set of tools, materials, 
and instructions was provided, and performance was scored in 
terms of the quality of the finished product and the time required 
to complete it." 
TESTS OF APTITUDES 
The second general division of our functional classification 
is tests of aptitudes. Some of these aptitudes are general; 
others are more specialized. While tests of acquired proficiencies 
are important, they are far from being the only tests the employer 
needs to use. A large part of the work done in offices, stores, 
and factories is not of the standardized skilled-trade type at all. 
There is often no opportunity to acquire the precise knowledge 
and skill necessary to do certain kinds of work except within the 
business establishment itself, either in a vestibule school, by 
means of some apprenticeship system, or by working under the 
eye of a fellow-employee or foreman until the ‘work is learned. 
In such cases, instead of proficiency tests, what is needed are 
aptitude tests—tests which will help to pick out those applicants 
who have the physical, sensory, motor, or intellectual aptitudes 
which will enable them to master the essential operations with 
a minimum of time and a maximum of efficiency. 
Sometimes these aptitudes are rather highly specialized. The 
abilities necessary for the routine work of an inspector of certain 
small parts may be accurate and quick co-ordination of par- 
tJ. C. Chapman, Trade Tests (Henry Holt & Co., 1921) gives a detailed de- 
scription of many of these tests, as used in the army.

  26 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
ticular arm, finger, and eye movements, sufficiently good visual 
and touch discrimination to detect flaws, and enough brains 
to understand and remember the simple instructions. But in 
some other cases, the work is not so simple and mechanical. 
New problems are constantly arising, and an employee, to be 
competent, must be able to “use his head.” In such cases 
what is most wanted may be a test of general intelligence, by 
which it will be possible to judge his ability to adjust himself 
to new situations. 
GENERAL APTITUDE TESTS 
Tests of general intelligence—Tests of general intelligence 
are also referred to as general ability tests, mental alertness 
tests, or learning ability tests. For our purposes we may treat 
these terms as synonymous. They constitute, without doubt, 
the most conspicuous class of tests at present. So conspicuous 
are they, and so important, that not infrequently the term 
“general intelligence test” is thought of as synonymous with 
psychological test. But we have said enough to show that they 
constitute only one class of psychological tests; and we should 
not forget that, being only one class, their range of usefulness is 
definitely limited. Nevertheless, for many purposes it is so im- 
portant to know the average level of one’s intellectual abilities 
that we are warranted in dwelling at some length on them. 
The earliest successful intelligence tests were devised by 
Alfred Binet and are called by his name, although various revi- 
sions of the original Binet scale have been produced. To pick 
out those children in the Paris schools whose general mental 
development was so delayed as to necessitate their being placed 
in special schools, he devised the plan of confronting them 
with a series of simple tasks of graded difficulty. By long 
experience he found which tasks were within the power of the 
average six-year old, the average seven-year old, and so on. 
These tasks included recognizing and naming simple objects,
-P-A-G-E-37
  THE NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS ai, 
stating similarities and differences between things, performing 
three simple commissions given simultaneously, pointing out 
absurdities in certain statements or omissions in pictures, rear- 
ranging disarranged sentences, telling the proper action in given 
emergencies, and the like. The Stanford Revision,’ the most 
widely used American adaptation of the Binet method, provides 
six tests for each year from three to ten, eight for twelve-year, 
six for fourteen-year, six for average adult, and six for superior 
adult intelligence. 
In the language of the Binet scale the child who can pass the 
tests equivalent to normal eight-year-old performance is said to 
have a mental age of eight. If his actual age is eight, he is said 
to be of normal intelligence, and his intelligence quotient or his 
I.Q.—mental age divided by chronological age, decimal point 
being omitted—is 100. If, however, he is only six, but with 
eight-year-old intelligence, he is described variously as two years 
mentally advanced, of superior intelligence, bright, or of an 1.Q. 
of 133. If, on the other hand, he has attained this eight-year 
intelligence level only at ten years of age, he is termed dull, 
retarded, or of an I.Q. of 80. Such terms are rapidly passing 
into everyday speech. 
In dealing with adults, we find the mental age and the 
LQ. concepts of very limited usefulness; and if those adults are 
normal—i.e., not feeble-minded or border-line cases—we may 
well dispense with these terms. In the first place, the tests them- 
selves are inadequate in number and variety for the higher stages 
—above twelve years—of development. In the second place, 
these upper-age tests have not been so satisfactorily standardized 
as those for earlier years, since it is harder to round up and 
test a really average group in order to get reliable age standards 
after they have passed beyond the compulsory school age. 
In testing those of high-school age and beyond—to a large 
extent in the elementary grades as well—other methods have 
*L. M. Terman, The Measurement of Intelligence, Houghton Mifflin Co., 1916.
-P-A-G-E-38
  28 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
been evolved. These may be briefly characterized as point- 
scale group tests. 
Group intelligence tests——Group tests may possibly be less 
accurate than individual tests, where the examiner can watch 
each individual and adapt his manner to the person’s emotional 
attitude. But the greater economy of group tests has led to 
their wide adoption in schools, employment offices, and other 
places where it is desirable to be able to test several people in a 
short time. 
The Army Alpha is the prototype of many general intelli- 
gence scales which have been devised in the past few years. The 
bibliography previously mentioned lists no less than sixty-five 
intelligence scales. Not all of these serve the same purpose. 
Some are for primary-school children, others for high-school or 
college students, and still others primarily for employment pur- 
poses. A few are individual, but most are group scales. The 
National, the Illinois, the various Otis tests, the Thurstone, the 
Thorndike (Columbia college-entrance test), the Terman, the 
Haggerty, and many other equally well-known tests have largely 
replaced the Alpha scale, although having the same general type 
of material and organization. 
The Chicago Group Intelligence Test,’ which is here repro- 
duced in full (see pp. 30-36), has been extensively used with 
high-school students, and is typical both in material and form 
of the other scales mentioned. 
One modification worth noting is the “self-administering” 
or “cycle” form of organization, of which the Thurstone and some 
of the Otis tests are examples. In these the different kinds of 
tests are not separately timed, but are “scrambled,” reappearing 
again and again throughout the test. This makes it easy to 
administer without error, particularly in the hands of those who 
t Thanks are due to Professors F. N. Freeman and H. O. Rugg for permission 
to reproduce this scale. The time allowances on the five parts of the test are one, 
three, two, two, and one minutes, respectively.

THE NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS 29 
are not trained testers, since no verbal instructions have to be 
given and the examiner needs to keep track only of the total 
time—thirty minutes being the usual time allowance. The inter- 
mingling of different kinds of material practically prevents any 
analytical study of relative performance on different kinds of 
material within the scale. 
Tests for illiterates—The problem of testing the intelligence 
of illiterates is met by using one or more of several kinds of 
performance tests. Some of these are individual tests, while 
others can be used as group tests. Among these may be men- 
tioned the following: form boards of various sorts, in which 
variously shaped blocks are to be fitted into a frame or placed 
in similarly shaped holes in a board; dissected picture puzzles 
of various types; arranging a series of pictures in such order that 
they tell a connected story; completing imperfect pictures, as 
for example a face lacking a nose; and mazes, through which the 
subject has to find and trace the shortest correct path. Many 
other tests requiring no ability to read or write have been devised. 
The Beta group test, used in the army for testing illiterates, in- 
cluded seven such tests arranged in pictorial or other non-verbal 
form, printed in a booklet, the directions being given in panto- 
mime and the responses made by marking or checking, or at 
most by copying single letters or figures. Of this same type are 
numerous pictorial group tests for primary-school pupils who 
have not yet mastered reading skill. 
Some psychologists assert that we should distinguish at 
least three broad classes of general intelligence—the abstract 
or verbal, the mechanical, and the social types—with many 
subvarieties under each; and that the kind of general ability 
most of the present general intelligence tests measure is only 
one class—ability to deal with verbal material and abstract 
thinking. There can be no doubt of the great importance of 
this kind of intelligence; but it would be a mistake to think 
that it is the only kind that counts. Many people who would

Teacher and Class should read these General Directions together. Be sure each 
pupil understands what’ is ta be done. In this booklet there are five exercises which 
help to tell how well you can do certain things. You will work one exercise at a time 
and the teacher will tell you. when to begin each one and when to stop. When the 
teacher says “Begin” turn the page and begin working them exactly in the order in 
which they are numbered. Work as rapidly as you can but remember that it is impor- 
tant to get the examples right. Try each one but do not spend longer on any one 
example if you are sure you cannot do it. Do not write anything after you are told to

score low on the Alpha show a high degree of ability to deal 
quickly and competently with problems involving tools, or 
mechanical or manual operations, even problems entirely 
novel. 
Tests of general mechanical aptitude—The Stenquist mechan- 
ical aptitude and assembling tests are good examples of tests for 
getting at this type of general ability. The assembling test 
consists of a series of small mechanical objects taken apart—a 
bicycle bell, a paper-clip, a cheap lock, a clip clothespin, a mouse- 
trap, a cupboard catch, etc.—which the individual is instructed 
to put together correctly as rapidly as possible. His perform- 
ance is scored both in terms of accuracy and time. The 
mechanical aptitude test is printed so that it can be given as 
a group test. Pictures of mechanical devices, tools, and the 
like are shown, and the subject indicates by letters and other 
marks the objects or parts which belong together. 
While all these tests involve more or less experience and 
training, and hence are definitely tests of acquired ability, that 
ability is of a general mechanical sort rather than ability pertain- 
ing to any specific occupation, and is to a large extent such as 
one of a mechanical turn of mind is likely to pick up for himself 
outside a trade school. They are, therefore, tests for aptitude 
and not trade tests. 
TESTS OF SPECIAL APTITUDES 
In contrast to the general aptitude tests we have described, 
tests of the next class, those of special aptitudes, are so varied 
that it is impossible to reduce them to elements or classes. 
Hence we can do little more than enumerate and describe 
some of those in most common use. The best-known reference 
book containing material on such tests is G. M.. Whipple’s 
Manual of Mental and Physical Tests, although far from all of 
the useful tests are described therein. We have suggested that
-P-A-G-E-47
   THE NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS 37 
these tests may be crudely classified as physical, motor, sensory, 
and intellectual—mental in the narrower sense—and this order 
will serve to orient us in our discussion. 
Physical tests are not, of course, strictly speaking, the 
psychologist’s business. But anyone who has worked with tests 
knows how impossible it is to draw fine distinctions between 
physical and mental tests. A test of endurance of hand-grip 
may test will as much as muscle. Leaving aside such hair- 
splitting issues, the psychologist does often have to know a great 
deal about traits which are definitely physical in order to supple- 
ment and interpret his other tests. Height, weight, skull- 
diameter and capacity, breathing capacity, chest expansion, 
strength of grip, endurance of grip, and a dozen other body 
measurements are a necessary part of any complete series of tests, 
whether for educational, clinical, or vocational purposes, and 
every tester is likely to have to make them. To some degree 
this is also true of the more strictly medical tests. 
Tests of motor aptitudes play an important réle in many 
industries. Tests for quickness and accuracy of movement, 
and of muscular co-ordination and control, appear in the test 
literature in a variety of forms. Quickness of movement may be 
tested, for example, by tapping with a metal stylus on a metal 
plate, both arranged in an electric circuit with an electric counter 
which counts the number of taps in a given period. One kind 
of bodily control is measured by standing the blindfolded subject 
beneath a horizontal, inverted, smoked-paper surface upon 
which a vertical pointer, fastened to his head, traces his involun- 
tary movements. Other motor tests have been specially devised 
to duplicate as closely as possible the conditions under which 
specific manual work is to be done. 
Sensory tests are of many sorts, and most are well known. 
They include tests for optical defects—errors of refraction, 
convergence, etc.—as made by the optometrist with an ophthal- 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
Bol: PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
moscope or vision chart and lenses, and which are necessary 
where perfect eyesight or perfectly fitted glasses are essential; 
tests of color-blindness for occupations like railroading or naviga- 
tion; watch-tick or whisper tests for acuity of hearing; tests 
for sense of pitch with tuning forks of slightly different vibra- 
tion rates, or with special phonograph records; tests of other 
musical capacities, such as those devised by Seashore,' some of 
which are available on phonograph records, others requiring 
special apparatus. Tests for the sense of equilibrium and the 
perception of slight movements, by whirling or tilting the subject 
and observing his verbal or pointing responses, have been tried 
in aviation. 
Tests of the simpler mental functions are among the oldest 
we have. They vary from the simpler attention and perception 
tests, up through the memory, association, and imagination tests, 
to the tests of judgment and higher mental processes. Strictly 
speaking, none of these are tests of single or even of simple 
processes; their simplicity is at most relative. Probably it is 
of very little practical importance for the tester to know just 
how to classify or name them. It is more important to know 
something of their scope and nature, and to find, by experiment, 
how closely ability in each of them correlates with the abilities 
we want to measure. 
As an example of tests which have found a place in industry, 
we may mention the following: The cancellation test, in which 
the subject is required to cross out each “A” or other letter or 
letters in a page of printed capitals in the shortest possible time.

   THE NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS 39 
Sorting tests of various kinds may involve sorting cards, though 
they may use instead the special materials with which the job 
deals. Memory-span tests measure the number of letters, 
digits, or unrelated words one can remember and repeat after 
hearing them once. These have been suggested as useful for 
telephone operators and for stenographers. Substitution tests, 
in which a series of digits are to be substituted for corresponding 
letters according to a prescribed code, have been used by some 
investigators for testing typing proficiency. Many of the 
separate tests which appear as parts of various general intelli- 
gence tests may be used separately for testing more limited 
mental functions. There are literally scores of other special 
mental-ability tests which we cannot even enumerate here, 
but which get at one or another of a variety of traits of vocational 
importance." 
A number of tests have been devised by various investigators 
for some particular occupation. Such, among others, is the 
apparatus devised by Miinsterberg and described in his Psy- 
chology and Industrial Efficiency, for testing street-car motormen, 
or Link’s modification of the Bogardus fatigue apparatus for 
testing machine operators. These cannot be classified as mental 
tests in the strictest sense, since they involve sensory and motor 
as well as intellectual aptitudes. But they are special rather 
than general because each was devised to fit a single occupation. 
TESTS OF CHARACTER, TEMPERAMENT, AND 
VOLITIONAL TRAITS 
Among the newer psychological tests are those for the 
many distinguishable volitional, temperamental, emotional, and 
character traits. These have not yet passed beyond the experi- 
mental stage. One of the best known is the Downey will- 
tH. C. Link, in the appendix to his Employment Psychology (Macmillan Co., 
1919), describes a number of these tests which he found useful.  
-P-A-G-E-50
   PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
srament test, available both in individual and group form. 
s chiefly modifications in the speed and form of handwriting 
avs material. It is designed to measure several temperamental 
or volitional traits, to which the following names have been given: 
“speed of movement,” “freedom from load” (tendency to work 
continuously at maximum speed), “flexibility,” “speed of deci- 
sion,” “motor impulsion,” “reaction to contradiction,” “resist- 
ance to opposition,” “finality of judgment,” “motor inhibition,” 
“interest in detail,” “co-ordination of impulses,” and “volitional 
perseveration.” 
Recent activities of many other workers in devising tests of 
such traits indicate the interest in this inadequately analyzed 
aspect of personality. Tests of such instinctive and emotional 
traits as susceptibility to anger or fear, or of such volitional 
traits as aggressiveness and perseverance, have been described 
in psychological periodicals, but they have not been sufficiently 
standardized to warrant description. 
Several tests of “moral judgment” have been proposed, such 
as a series of hypothetical acts which the subject is required to 
rank in order of relative merit or demerit. These have been 
used to some extent among delinquents and defectives and reveal 
the frequent lack of ability on the part of these unfortunates to 
estimate correctly even the more obvious moral values. But 
“circumstances alter cases,’ and, moreover, even the ablest 
judges will not always agree on which of two sins is the more 
heinous, or on which of two acts is the more praiseworthy. 
Hence such tests on any advanced scale have very doubtful 
value. 
But what is more important, moral judgment is only one 
factor in morality. Most people know better than they do. An 
intelligent criminal could doubtless make a perfect score in a test, 
telling what should or should not be done in certain situations, 
providing he thought he had anything to gain by passing such a    
-P-A-G-E-51
THE NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS 41 
test. To know what, according to common standards, ought to 
be done, is no guaranty that one will have the habit of doing 
so or the desire to do so. The Voelker tests of habits of moral 
trustworthiness used in studying moral education among Boy 
Scouts have shown that there is a possibility of character tests. 
These tests set up critical situations to find whether the boy 
succeeds or fails in conforming his conduct to the accepted 
standards of honesty, punctuality, faithfulness, and the like. 
The success of such tests rests wholly upon the subject’s not 
knowing that he is being tested. This condition it is rarely 
possible to achieve. 
There is another phase of social personality, however, more 
easily examined, and that is the range of one’s interests. A 
common method is to provide a series of questions, each with 
alternative answers to be checked, or else statements some of 
which are true and some false, to be correctly indicated, and per- 
taining to a wide range of human interests. This method 
assumes, probably with justification, that the range and character 
of a man’s knowledge is an index of the range and character of 
his interests. If one answers correctly every question about base- 
ball, fishing, and poker, and misses most of those about religion 
and literature, it indicates at least something about him. One 
test of this type asks fifty questions about such diverse recrea- 
tional interests as popular songs, sports and games, underworld 
slang, etc., and is said to be useful for selecting salesmen for work 
where wide and ready social adaptability to men of various classes 
is necessary. 
It will be evident by now that the field of psychological 
tests is one capable of indefinite—almost infinite—expansion; 
for only a comparatively few representative samples have here 
been mentioned. Some of these have proved their worth for 
occupational selection in various lines; others may yet do so. 
One who endeavors to select tests for a given occupation finds at

hand many ready-made standard tests, and his principal task 
may be to find out whether these tests do really serve to distin- 
guish good from poor workers. If he cannot find ready-made 
tests to meet his needs, his first task is to devise and standardize 
tests which he thinks will be worth trying out. But, in any case, 
his problem is not solved until such tests have been actually 
tried out on workers of known ability and the value of the tests 
for the specific purpose in mind scientifically determined.

CHAPTER II 
SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN CONSTRUCTING 
PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS FOR 
BUSINESS 
The distinctive characteristic of science is its method. This 
is as true of science in the service of industrial selection of workers 
as of science in the physics laboratory or science in weather 
prediction. The most important single fact about a psychological 
test is that its value has been scientifically determined. Stand- 
ardized psychological tests differ from ordinary employment 
methods not so much in their form and contents as in the process 
of scientific proof to which they have been subjected. The tests 
may contain some of the same questions that a foreman asks his 
applicants. Or the test devices may look like meaningless 
puzzles or amusing parlor games. The question, however, is not 
which ‘devices look as though they ought to work best. It is 
simply: What scientific evidence is there that this test does work ? 
The insistence is upon scientifically proved methods of selection, 
regardless of whether tests are in question, or some other pro- 
cedure. 
Any of the definite items of information utilized in the 
acceptance and rejection of applicants can be subjected to pre- 
cisely the same scientific check and evaluation as can tests. It 
is not a whit less scientific, for example, to utilize a knowledge of 
the applicant’s age, years of schooling, years of experience, and 
the like, than it is to use his scores on a series of psychological 
tests, provided the former items have been subjected to the same 
painstaking statistical check as have the latter. 
To obtain the point of view of scientific research in employ- 
ment procedure is more important than to decide the pros and 
43  
-P-A-G-E-54
    
  44 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
cons of particular tests or even of tests in general. If all the 
psychological tests in existence were destroyed tomorrow, there 
would remain the valuable influence they have exerted in the 
direction of increased application of scientific method in personnel 
practice. While, then, our discussion here will deal definitely 
with the scientific method of constructing and verifying psycho- 
logical tests, it should be clear as we proceed that the methods 
as such are of general applicability. 
_/4 THE TESTING OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS 
Not all psychological tests are good. Some of them are 
worse than useless. ‘The mere fact that tests are used in a given 
situation does not mean that results of demonstrated value are 
being achieved. Anyone can make a test, and anyone can use 
tests. The process is simplicity itself. One merely asks some 
questions, or brings together some puzzles, or instructs the per- 
son tested to perform some acts—acts that are foolish or sensible, 
depending upon the temperament and ingenuity of the test- 
builder. But with the statement that it is easy to construct 
tests, and that it is easy to give tests, let us always link the even 
more significant statement that there are bad psychological tests 
as well as good psychological tests. 
Constructing tests and constructing effective tests are not 
identical. Using tests on faith is a very different process from 
using tests on the basis of their demonstrated value. Here, pre- 
cisely, is the significance of the entire technique of test building 
and test standardization. The problem is in part the devising 
or choosing of tests that appear promising, but the decidedly 
more important part of the task consists of “testing the tests,” 
that is, of ascertaining just how well each test works. If it were 
possible to tell by looking at tests which ones would prove satis- 
factory, and which would not, there would obviously be no need 
of careful methods for determining their relative merits. But 
experience has demonstrated that the description of a test reveals 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
  
SCIENTIFIC METHOD 45 
little concerning its value. The one safe method by which to 
judge the excellence of a test is to test it. A priori opinions 
regarding tests have been repeatedly contradicted by later results. 
So true is this, in fact, that scientific workers in the field fre- 
quently begin their search for a useful test by trying a rather 
large number of different tests in the confident expectation that 
many of those tried will prove unfit and be rejected. But these 
weak Jinks cannot be detected and eliminated in advance. Re- 
course must be had to experiment. 
‘ vit follows quite reasonably that if one is to form sound judg- 
ments about psychological tests, it is more important to under- 
stand the technique of evaluating tests than to be familiar with 
particular sorts of tests or to know what these are alleged to 
be measuring. The real question about a psychological test is: 
Does it work? That question implies that there is a definite 
purpose for which the test is desired, and that the success with 
which that purpose is satisfied is, in the final analysis, the only 
basis on which the value of the test can be estimated. Ordinarily, 
the purpose is clear—the test is to aid in selecting people with 
respect to their ability for some particular line of work or course 
of training. The excellence of the test in fulfilling that purpose 
is the thing to be determined. Does the test enable us to make 
predictions as to people’s fitness for the job in an appreciably better, 
cheaper, or more expeditious manner than can be made without 
the test? If it does, it is a successful test; if not, it is unsuc- 
cessful. 
The most straightforward procedure for ascertaining the 
“success” of a test can be very briefly stated: The test is given 
to a number of individuals whose ability in the job is already 
known or can later be determined. If test scores agree sufficiently 
closely with the known ability of the persons tested, the test is 
satisfactory. It can then be used to predict the ability of 
unknown persons of the same general group as those upon whom 
it has been tried. Clearly, however, this bare statement needs  
-P-A-G-E-56
  46 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
a great deal of amplifying and qualification. Whether or not a 
test “works” is to be answered only after careful experimental 
investigation along the lines just indicated. 
Before we proceed to discuss the actual steps in the construc- 
tion and standardizing of tests, it is to be noted that there are 
some few tests the value of which has already been definitely 
established through many experimental tryouts. Where an 
occupation is highly standardized, and uniform from one business 
establishment to another, it is often possible to infer that a test 
which operated successfully in the one will, without necessity 
of further proof, prove satisfactory in the other. Thus a test 
for typists, once it has been carefully prepared and verified in 
several companies, may be widely adopted by other companies, 
provided reasonable precautions are observed in administering 
it and interpreting the scores. 
There are comparatively few of these ready-to-use tests avail- 
able, however. Even with fool-proof intelligence tests, and tests 
of trade proficiency, the purposes for which these are used and 
the conditions of their administration are likely to differ so 
markedly from plant to plant that experimental tryouts are indis- 
pensable. It has been found, for example, that the level of men- 
tal alertness of office boys and clerks in one office may require 
the use of very different standards from those in use in some 
other office. It has been found that tests which were successfully 
used in selecting shell and cartridge inspectors were almost worth- 
less in selecting workers for the allied occupation of gauging shells. 
It has been found that intelligence tests which proved worthless 
when used with certain groups of factory workers were decidedly 
valuable in another factory. Trade tests which gave good results 
in the army have failed to work in certain industrial situations. 
All such results that are available point to the same conclusion. 
The same test will give the same results only in case the conditions 
and purpose governing its use are closely similar. And it is 
usually impossible to know that the situations are sufficiently   
      
 
-P-A-G-E-57
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD 47 
similar except by trying out the test anew to see whether it does 
give useful results. 
The fact remains, nevertheless, that some few tests for cer- 
tain widely standardized occupations have been tried in so many 
places and under so many different conditions that it is now pos- 
sible to use them as generally applicable tests for those occupa- 
tions. This is true, for example, of occupations such as typist 
and stenographer, and a number of the manual trades. It is also 
true of a wide variety of unstandardized occupations where “ gen- 
eral intelligence” or mental alertness and abstract thinking abil- 
ity are important requirements. Thus general intelligence tests 
have been used to indicate the alertness of clerical workers, sales- 
men, office boys, and so on, just as they were used for testing men 
in the army and are used for testing children in the schools. 
Wherever these standardized tests are put into immediate use 
without special tryout, however, it is a wise policy to keep careful 
records of results, and to check back, as soon as this can conven- 
iently be done, to ascertain precisely how valuable the results 
are in this new situation. 
FUNDAMENTALS OF TEST CONSTRUCTION AND 
STANDARDIZATION 
1. Know the requirements of the job—Some knowledge of the 
work for which people are to be selected is essential. If one is 
to devise a test for drill-press operators or typesetters or shipping 
clerks, he needs to know with considerable intimacy what is done 
by individuals in each of these occupations. The tests which are 
to be experimented with can be chosen only on the basis of some 
more or less plausible relationship between particular tests and 
the sort of duties performed in the job to be filled. 
2. Choose or devise tests to be tried out.—After the test techni- 
cian has become sufficiently acquainted with the work for which 
men are to be selected, his next task is to decide upon tests that 
appear to be promising for the specific purpose at hand. Fre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  48 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
quently there are tests already available which have been used 
elsewhere for similar occupations or which appear for some other 
reason to be promising candidates for selection as successful tests. 
At other times, the psychologist finds no tests already in use which 
are quite the sort he desires, and in that case he may devise new 
ones. In this matter of choosing and devising tests, we can 
readily appreciate the importance both of a wide knowledge of 
tests and test results, and of ingenuity in planning new devices 
or variations of old ones. As was earlier mentioned, the expert 
in seeking tests for a job is usually not able, with any assurance, 
to state in advance which test, or even which kind of test, will 
prove successful, though this is not true of certain of the occupa- 
tions where tests have been widely standardized. The typical 
procedure, accordingly, is to begin the experiment with a number 
of tests. Some will early be eliminated; others are likely to give 
results sufficiently valuable to justify their retention and use. 
Clearly the expense and the success or failure of building tests 
depends largely upon the wise initial selection of tests to be tried. 
The office manager who tried out, as a test for bookkeepers, prob- 
lems in extracting cube root and solving algebraic equations was 
pretty definitely foredoomed to failure. Even clever guesses as 
to good tests, however, are worthless unless combined with a 
thoroughgoing experimental and statistical check to prove the 
wisdom of the choice. 
3. Obtain the scores made on the selected tests by individuals 
whose ability in the job is ascertainable.—Once the tests to be 
tried are decided upon, the way to find whether they “work” 
is to try them out and see what happens. The way in which 
the tests are administered and all other conditions affecting 
test results must duplicate as nearly as possible the conditions 
under which it is proposed to use the tests. Hence, typically, 
the best procedure is to try the tests on all the applicants who 
are considered for the given job, just as they would be ased in 
regular employment procedure. A less desirable method, but
-P-A-G-E-59
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD 49 
the one which for practical reasons is most used, is to try the tests 
on workers already employed in the occupation. The important 
thing is to have the conditions of the tryout and the kind of 
people who are tested as similar as possible to the conditions and 
people that will be involved in the final use of the tests. The 
number of persons for the experimental tryout must be sufficiently 
great to insure their being truly representative of the general 
run of applicants for that occupation, or of the general run of 
workers in the occupation, if the test is being tried out on men 
already employed. 
4. Obtain some measure of the ability on the job of the indi- 
viduals who were tested.—In order to judge how well the tests 
indicate the abilities of workers, it is necessary to secure definite 
information as to the amount of ability in the given kind of 
work possessed by each of these men. There are three principal 
sources of this information which is to constitute the criterion 
against which test scores will be checked. In the first place, 
production records are available for many lines of work, which 
show the exact output of each individual worker. These may 
frequently be used directly as the measure of individual efficiency 
on the job. For very many occupations, however, individual 
production records are not obtainable, or are not an adequate 
measure of competence. In these instances, a second sort of 
criterion is used, namely, estimates of the worker’s ability at 
his job by the executive under whom he works. These personal 
opinions have many shortcomings and grave inaccuracies, but 
when properly safeguarded, and obtained from several executives 
independently, they prove at least tolerably satisfactory. 
Another criterion of an entirely different kind is sometimes 
added to production records and ratings by superior executives. 
It is the record of the length of time the individual employees 
remain on the job. Clearly, it is important to ascertain whether 
men with high or low test scores show a higher rate of turnover 
than do those with less high or low scores. This criterion is 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  50 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
almost always to be used in conjunction with the measure of 
ability supplied in supervisors’ ratings or production records. 
5. Determine the agreement existing between test scores and 
ability on the job.—The two preceding steps are significant only 
as they are utilized for purposes of careful statistical comparison. 
The logic of the situation is simple. If the men with high test 
scores prove to be the men with high production records or 
supervisors’ ratings, and the men with low test scores prove 
to be the workers who fail to make good, then to the degree that 
this agreement holds true, the test is successful. The inference 
is, of course, that if the test shows successfully the ability of the 
individuals in the group upon whom it is used experimentally, 
it will be similarly useful in predicting the ability of any unknown 
applicant. The usual statistical method for ascertaining the 
closeness of the relationship is called “correlation,” and the 
numerical index of the relationship is a “correlation coefficient.” 
If there is considerable agreement, the correlation coefficient is 
high; if very little agreement, the correlation coefficient is low. 
The excellence of a particular test may, then, roughly be said 
to be indicated by the size of the coefficient. In everyday 
language, this is nothing more than the statement that the value 
of a test is shown by seeing how well it picks out good workers 
and poor workers. Often it is possible to make such comparisons 
more effectively by simple statements such as: Of all workers 
scoring below 138 on this test, 92 per cent failed to make good 
on the job, while above that score only 20 per cent failed at the 
work. 
Correlation coefficients and percentage comparisons do not 
automatically tell whether the test is a good one to use. That 
decision must depend upon other facts as well, one of which is 
the degree of success of alternative methods of selection for this 
job. If, for example, the years of schooling of the applicants 
show the same relationship to their ability at the work as do the 
test scores, it may not be worth while using the tests. It will   
     
-P-A-G-E-61
SCIENTIFIC METHOD 51 
not be worth while, that is, unless the tests and years of schooling 
combined work appreciably better as a basis for prediction than 
does the amount of schooling taken alone. 
6. Set test standards for the acceptance, rejection, or classification 
of applicants——If some of the tests tried out experimentally 
give sufficiently good results to warrant their further use, it is 
then necessary to set standards or “critical scores.” For 
example, a score is specified at such a point that applicants 
scoring below this are not accepted for the job unless they have 
special compensating qualifications; or a score may be set at a 
point where it is possible to say that applicants scoring above 
this are to be given specially favorable consideration for employ- 
ment; or several ranges of scores may be indicated which will 
divide candidates into classes according to their ability. All 
these standards are set on the basis of the scores actually made 
by individuals of known ability. 
The foregoing account of the successive steps in scientific 
test-building needs to be greatly expanded. We turn, accord- 
ingly, to a more detailed discussion of the methods used in each 
of the six steps. 
JOB ANALYSIS AND TEST CONSTRUCTION 
The necessity for knowing something about the job for 
which tests are to be found is self-evident. But how is this 
information to be secured by the test psychologist ? How detailed 
must the knowledge be? Can the information be obtained second 
hand, or must the tester himself observe the work, or must he 
even undertake to learn the operations himself in order to have 
the “feel” of the task? Is knowledge concerning the job more 
useful for test purposes if it is systematized and formulated, or 
are general impressions and “hunches” usually satisfactory? We 
shall try to throw some light on these questions, though a 
complete answer is not possible. Some experts emphasize the 
importance of careful detailed analysis of the job before test 
   
-P-A-G-E-62
  52 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
construction is undertaken, with an attempt systematically to 
describe the elementary psychophysical requirements of the 
work; others advocate only a rough acquaintance with the nature 
of the work, such as can be obtained by relatively short periods 
of casual observation. Despite these differences of opinion, 
however, we cannot lose sight of the fact that all agree as to the 
necessity of some familiarity with the work for which tests are 
to be built. 
The insistence upon rather detailed and systematized descrip- 
tions of job requirements as a preliminary to psychological 
testing has been markedly affected by the use of such job descrip- 
tions for other purposes. Job analysis as a generally useful 
method in personnel work has been greatly emphasized in recent 
years. And among the long lists of purposes which the detailed 
analyses are said to serve is frequently included the statement 
that they constitute a basis for the development of tests. With- 
out attempting to enter into a discussion of the nature and useful- 
ness of job analysis in general, we would point out merely that 
these studies of jobs rarely contain the sort of information that 
is likely to aid the test psychologist. After all, a job analysis 
includes those things which the analyzer by training and interest 
is prepared to describe. Typically, his purpose is not to find 
information of value for test construction and hence the ordinary 
analysis contains little material which the industrial psychologist 
would find of value for test purposes. 
But is it possible and desirable to have special job analyses 
made which will methodically gather exact information about 
the job specifically for purposes of test-building? As an ideal, 
this appears entirely praiseworthy. Nothing would be so satis- 
factory as to have a psychologist make a careful inventory of 
the elementary psychophysical requirements of a job and then 
apply certain of his tests to measure each of the required abilities. 
Perhaps some day we shall use this method. While up to the 
present time only a few attempts of the sort have been recorded,
-P-A-G-E-63
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD 53 
it is nevertheless possible to point to the kind of information 
that would be sought in the special analysis of a job for test- 
building purposes. It would include a detailed study of sensory 
capacities required, muscular co-ordinations and dexterity, 
strength of various body parts, emotional and temperamental 
characteristics, physical attributes, special intellectual aptitudes, 
etc. Each of these classes includes an immense number of sub- 
divisions. Detailed analyses of this sort are not a generally 
practicable method at the present time because of the great 
difficulty in ascertaining the qualities required and the equally 
formidable task of finding tests to get at these elementary 
abilities. Perhaps the most elaborate effort in this direction has 
been the analysis of the abilities required of a musician, with an 
attempt to find tests for these abilities. While some measure of 
success has been attained, it is important to note that the task 
has engaged the time of a group of research scientists over a 
period of years. Nevertheless, attempts such as this do point 
the way to possible future developments. 
We must distinguish between a complete systematized analy- 
sis of the qualifications for a job and the detection of a few 
outstanding requirements. While elaborate studies of the kind 
just mentioned are at present not practicable in industry, it is 
possible to analyze out a few of the abilities that are clearly 
needed. It is useful, for example, to recognize that a railroad 
engineer must have normal ability to see colors, or that factory 
workers in a particular job must have a certain strength of hand 
muscles or a certain speed of reaction. Simple specifications of 
abilities of this sort are not difficult to arrive at, and they do 
serve to suggest tests to be tried out. The special job analysis 
for test-building purposes is similar but it would include a great 
many of the detailed items and would aim at making an exhaus- 
tive catalogue of the qualities required. 
We return to the original statement that the test psycholo- 
gist must, as a matter of course, have some knowledge of the job,   
      
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  54 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
adding now the opinion that at the present time it does not appear 
practicable to obtain the information by thoroughgoing, analyti- 
cal studies, however desirable these analyses may be for other 
purposes, and however justifiable they are theoretically. The 
alternative is that the expert should have sufficient familiarity. 
with the job to afford him a basis for wise predictions as to the 
sorts of tests that will work. Usually this means having a fair 
general understanding of the work and an insight into the 
essential features that determine success of workers in this job. 
This knowledge of the job is best gained in most cases by personal 
observation or even by performing the task. At times, doubtless, 
it is useful to set down methodically some outstanding require- 
ments of the work, though in most instances the necessity of even 
this is questionable. The emphasis we place upon informal 
familiarity with the work to be tested for and the “‘feel” of the 
job, as over against elaborate, long-worded descriptions, possibly 
seems a departure from scientific procedure. Further evidence 
in support of this common-sense approach, however, will appear 
in the ensuing discussion. Here we wish only to add the fact 
that in actual practice results have been obtained almost entirely 
by the non-analytic procedure. Even where investigators have 
made some effort to present careful analyses of the jobs, one 
usually comes away with the feeling that the analyses have about 
the same closeness of relationship to the actual test construction 
as the platform of a political party has to its subsequent activities. 
But this does not mean that a closer relationship would not be 
highly desirable. 
PRELIMINARY SELECTION OF TESTS 
The industrial psychologist is familiar with literally hundreds 
of different tests that have been used. In addition, he sees 
endless possibilities of new tests or modifications of old ones. 
When, now, he is confronted with the problem of deciding what 
particular tests to try experimentally as tests for a certain job,
-P-A-G-E-65
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD 55 
how is he to make the choice? Asa matter of fact, he depends 
largely on wise guesses. The ingenuity and insight manifested 
at this point will determine in no small measure his ultimate 
success in finding tests, the usefulness of which can be demon- 
strated. He may use either ready-made tests or he may feel that 
it is necessary to devise new ones. The decision as to what tests 
shall be tried out is based, of course, both upon the knowledge 
of the work for which tests are needed and upon a wide familiarity 
with tests of all sorts. The better equipped the test expert is in 
both directions, the better chance he has of getting results. 
In our present state of knowledge, an intimate and informal 
“feel” of the job is likely to be more richly suggestive of promising 
selective devices than is a formal analysis. And similarly, a close 
first-hand knowledge of testing methods and materials and the 
results obtained from these is more valuable in bringing fruitful 
guesses than is the attempt to use this test because it is called 
a test of “attention,” and that test because it is called a test of 
“foresight,” and still other tests because they are labeled 
“memory” or “reasoning” or “persistence.” Usually, in other 
words, tests to be tried out can be better chosen through clever 
“hunches” based upon wide experience and keen insight than 
they can be through what appears superficially to be a more 
finished and precise scientific analysis. 
Lest it be thought that this “loose” procedure is a sign of 
weakness in test technique, we may recall that it is part of the 
general procedure of science, and that it is possible to cite from 
other branches of science illustrations of the same method. For, 
as a matter of fact, this process of forming wise guesses (“hypoth- 
eses” science calls them), often without antecedent detailed 
analysis, is a most typical step in sciences generally. Always, 
of course, the guesses are subjected to rigorous proof or disproof 
after they have occurred to the scientist. So are the guesses as 
to tests. The initial choice is only a first step. The indis- 
pensable sequel is the thoroughgoing testing of the test—or, in 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  56 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
more general terms, the verifying of the hypothesis. This 
further consideration, however, is to be noted: As a science 
develops and becomes more exact, dependence upon impressions 
as the starting-points for applications diminishes. There always 
remains, however, a considerable area at the frontier of a science 
where the accumulation of analytical knowledge is still insufficient 
basis for the solving of new problems. Industrial psychology 
may hope gradually to remove larger and larger parts of the test 
field from the realm where guesses must be made and then 
verified—just as, for example, the chemist or physicist has done. 
But at present the test expert has little established basis of 
facts from which to reason. He must accordingly guess, and then 
test his guesses. 
Consider an example or two of scientific “guesses” in other 
fields. Darwin formed his hypothesis of organic evolution when 
still a young man; the rest of his life was spent subjecting it 
to the test of meeting actual facts. Newton is said to have 
formed his initial notion of the law of universal gravitation when 
he saw an apple fall. The proof of that hypothesis involved 
years of astronomical observation and intricate mathematical 
calculation. Perhaps the gap seems too great between laws of 
evolution and gravitation and the construction of job tests. 
But the underlying scientific method is identical. Let us take 
one other example, somewhat less remote. An _ industrial 
chemist wishes to find the best metal composition to meet certain 
specified conditions. The product must withstand a variety 
of chemical actions, it must have certain strength, certain 
appearance, etc. The chemist has no answer to the problem 
ready to hand. He forms some wise guesses as to what sort of 
metal composition is needed. Probably his guesses are more 
sagacious and better founded than are those the test psychologist 
must make, simply because chemistry is farther advanced in its 
accumulation of exact knowledge. But essentially the methods 
are the same. ‘The chemist proceeds to try out his best guess
-P-A-G-E-67
  
SCIENTIFIC METHOD 57 
just as the test expert tries out his. The results of the experiment 
determine whether or not the guess was good enough. 
To return to our discussion of the choice of tests, it is well 
that we inquire in what ways they are related to the jobs for 
which they are intended. Tests for particular occupations may 
readily be classified according to the sort of relation the test 
bears to the job itself. Thus, the tests may be: 
1. Samples of the job. 
2. Devices for measuring the separate abilities used in the job. 
3. Devices for measuring the central or outstanding ability used in 
the job. 
4. Imitative repetitions of the job. (“Replicas” or “miniature job 
tests.’’) 
5. Devices bearing no apparent or obvious relation to the job. 
Of the tests which have actually been devised there are a 
number that fall in each of these five divisions. Different 
investigators have been especially partial to one or another of 
these classes in going about the choice of tests for experimental 
tryout. Without attempting to settle the question as to the 
advantages and disadvantages of tests of the several sorts, we 
shall give an example or two of each, and indicate some of the 
outstanding characteristics to be considered in adopting one or 
another variety. : 
Tests which are samples of jobs have their principal place 
as proficiency tests—tests of trade knowledge and skill, or of 
educational attainment. The obvious way of testing an applicant 
claiming typing skill is to obtain, under standardized conditions, 
a measurable sample of his typewriting. Similarly with an 
individual’s knowledge of French, his ability to spell, or his 
proficiency in operating a lathe. Army trade tests and almost 
all educational tests fall into this division of tests which are 
samples of the work in which ability is to be judged. The 
difficulty in the sampling method of test construction is to find 
samples that are sufficiently representative of the work as a whole. 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
    58 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
Ordinarily this is reasonably practicable only where the job is 
fairly homogeneous, though trade tests have been constructed 
for rather complex trades. The sample method is apparently 
not useful in constructing aptitude tests because, in the nature 
of the case, samples or actual parts of the job performance 
cannot be a fair test for the individual who has not been trained 
in that line of work. 
The second class of tests—devices for measuring the separate 
abilities used in the job—has already been discussed in general 
terms. It has been pointed out that detailed analysis of the 
abilities required for a particular job has not thus far proved 
fruitful as a method of test-building. The theoretical desirability 
of this precise method has attracted certain test psychologists, 
however, and several tests have been worked out in this manner. 
Miinsterberg, for example, in one of the earliest vocational tests 
on record, attempted to judge the ability of telephone operators 
by testing separately “eight different psychophysical functions,” 
including memory for digits, attention as indicated by the 
speed in crossing out ‘‘a’s” on a newspaper page, intelligence 
as measured by a word-association test, exactitude of space 
perception, etc. An outstanding example of this method, 
earlier referred to, is Seashore’s work in analyzing and testing 
musical aptitude. 
In spite of the difficulties in the use of this method, there is 
a great deal to be said in its favor. This is especially true if we 
include not only the formal and elaborate attempts at complete 
analysis but also the rather simple inquiries which aim to find 
a few of the more important abilities needed for the job. An 
informal analysis of the separate abilities used in the work is 
likely to suggest a number of tests to be tried out. Tests of 
simple sensory abilities and muscular movements are particularly 
apt to be hit upon in this way, although great uncertainty 
still attaches to the more complex processes. All the tests, no 
matter how clearly they seem to be measures of special abilities
-P-A-G-E-69
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD 50 
required for the job, must of course be subjected to tryout. 
The dangers in this analytical method of test selection are, first, 
the tendency to make the analyses more elaborate and detailed 
than is justified by the use made of them and, second, the tempta- 
tion to accept the results of the analysis without submitting 
these results to experimental verification. Wisely used, however, 
analytical inquiries as to the qualities needed in a job furnish a 
valuable basis for guesses of tests to be tried. 
The same statements can be made about the third class of 
tests listed—devices for measuring the central or crucial ability 
required for a job. To the extent that we can find such a central 
capacity, we are aided in the search for tests which show promise. 
Tests built upon the central capacity theory are well illustrated 
by another of Miinsterberg’s earliest tests—that for street-car 
motormen. Miinsterberg decided the central ability required is 
“a particular complicated act of attention by which the mani- 
foldness of objects . . . . [is] continuously observed with refer- 
ence to their rapidity and direction in the quick changing pano- 
rama of the street.” Accordingly, he devised an ingenious 
apparatus aimed to test this “particular complicated act of 
attention.” His test for ship officers proceeded similarly with 
an attempt to tap the central or key mental process required. 
This method of test-building has not been much followed by later 
investigators. 
The last two varieties of tests in our list have been especially 
vigorously defended and attacked by different industrial psy- 
chologists. Imitative representations of jobs or miniature 
reproductions of the tasks have had a special appeal which is 
readily explainable. Somehow, it does seem more reasonable 
to test a prospective punch-press operator by having him push 
paper strips into a diminutive stamping apparatus than to have 
him draw pencil lines in a prescribed manner or press a telegraph

work as a file clerk by having her sort cards or alphabetize lists 
than to require her to take a mental arithmetic test. But actual 
results so frequently belie these confident anticipations that one 
begins to question how generally safe it is to rely upon apparent 
analogy between the job and the test. Too frequently the 
miniature operation only appears to be identical; the actual 
movements and, still more, the actual mental attitude may be 
very different indeed. It is probable that many tests will 
continue to be built as more or less close imitations or miniatures 
of the actual job. Doubtless not a few of these will prove 
valuable. But eternal caution is necessary lest we assume that 
because the test resembles the work, it must be a good test. 
Only by proceeding to test the test in the same rigorous experi- 
mental manner as is necessary in verifying less plausible looking 
tests can we be justified in the further use of the vocational 
miniature or replica. 
One important source of the popularity of this kind of test 
is the relative ease with which it may be “sold” to business men. 
It looks sensible. Many tests do not. And that, precisely, 
is why our warning is needed. A test cannot be accepted 
because of its plausible appearance or rejected because it seems 
remote or unrelated to the job. Only on the basis of experimental 
results can the test be judged. There is this to be said for the 
imitative test, however—that it frequently is the most promising 
sort of a test to choose for preliminary tryout, provided, of course, 
care is used to preserve the really important features of the actual 
' job. One of its advantages—at times an important practical 
advantage—is that it will likely be better received by the indi- 
viduals to be tested than would be some apparently foolish or 
unrelated task. The same is obviously true of tests which are 
samples of the job. 
The final kind of test that may be used in the preliminary 
tryout we have called “devices bearing no apparent or obvious 
relation to the job.” That is about all there is to say by way 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD 61 
of description of such tests. They may be of any and every sort. 
The test expert tries a number of them, knowing that many will 
not work, but hoping that at least one or two of the array will 
fill the bill. This procedure, unscientific as it may sound at 
first, is perhaps the most commonly used, and has on occasion 
produced good results. As a matter of fact, the method is not 
nearly as haphazard as it is usually pictured to be. The test 
expert, in actual practice, does not choose his tests for tryout 
blindly or indiscriminately. When we speak of these tests as 
“bearing no apparent or obvious relation to the job,” the words 
“apparent” and “obvious” need to be emphasized. The tests 
do bear a relationship to the job—and usually the tester can point 
out quite definitely, if he has to, what he conceives that relation- 
ship to be. Almost without exception it is possible to bring 
the test into one or another of our preceding classes. Since, 
however, this is not explicitly done, we are probably justified in 
continuing to use this fifth nondescript class. Several test 
studies are on record where the strictly empirical procedure 
implied by this sort of test has been used. An assortment of 
tests is tried out on a group of clerical employees, typists, factory 
workers, college students, or the like, and then from the results 
it is determined which tests were most successful and which ones 
least so. The method of experiment and statistical evaluation is, 
of course, identical with that necessary for any other of the 
varieties of tests we have been considering. 
We cannot too often repeat the thought that regardless of 
which of the preceding sorts of tests is chosen, experimental 
evaluation or tryout is indispensable. However good or however 
bad the test may look, the real value is to be ascertained only 
by testing the test. To the further steps in this process we 
accordingly give our attention. 
EXPERIMENTAL USE OF THE TESTS 
The distinction between the experimental tryout of the tests 
and their actual administrative use has already been emphasized. 
 
-P-A-G-E-72

62 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
During the experimental use of the tests, the purpose is solely 
to ascertain the value of the tests. The resulting scores are not 
to be utilized for making any decisions concerning the individuals 
tested. It is important that this clear differentiation in purpose 
be kept in mind. 
Three questions arise which we shall briefly deal with in the 
next few paragraphs. First, what people shall be tested for 
experimental purposes? Second, how many individuals shall 
be tested? ‘Third, under what conditions shall these tests be 
conducted? Let us take these questions one at a time. 
The tests may be tried out either with applicants for the job 
or with employees at present working at the job. The former 
is theoretically more desirable; the latter is usually more practi- 
cable. The advantage of using applicants whenever it can be 
done is that the conditions of the tryout are thus made closely 
similar to the conditions under which it is later planned to use 
the tests. The applicants constitute the actual group with whom 
the test is to be used in practice; hence, whatever relationship of 
tests to abilities is found in experiments with these applicants is 
pretty certain to be true later in the administrative use of the tests. 
There are, however, difficulties in the tryout of tests upon appli- 
cants—especially the delay involved. The number of applicants 
placed in a particular job within a relatively short period of time 
is usually not large. The tester must, therefore, wait over very 
long periods—a delay which is usually undesirable or entirely 
impracticable. There are likely, too, to be special inconveniences 
in the practical arrangements for the giving of the tests during the 
preliminary stages. The advantages of the tryout with appli- 
cants are such, however, as to make it thoroughly desirable to 
use this method as part, at least, of the test-evaluating procedure 
even where the main tryout must be with present employees. 
In the experimental stage, all applicants should be given the 
tests, but they should be interviewed and accepted or rejected 
wholly without reference to the test scores. The fests are being  
-P-A-G-E-73
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD 63 
tested, not the applicants. If this process is continued for a 
time, it will then be possible to see whether the test scores, if 
they had been used, would have made more successful selection 
possible than was accomplished without them. It would be 
desirable during this experimental period to hire all applicants 
who showed even a minimum of possibilities for the job, so that 
the agreement between their test scores and their later efficiency 
on the job could be determined, as well as that of the better appli- 
cants. In practice this is often impossible. In fact, purely for 
practical reasons, tests are ordinarily not experimentally tried out 
with applicants at all, but rather are given to present employees. 
When present employees are used for the tryout, the testing 
can usually be done quite expeditiously. The most important 
requirement is that all workers at the job be tested or, if there 
are a great many, that a representative sampling of the whole 
group be tested. If only certain selected workers are tested— 
for example, the extremely good ones and the extremely poor 
ones-—the statistical interpretation of the results obtained will 
be almost worthless. For clearly in that case we cannot infer 
that the relations found in the artificially selected group will be 
true in the entire unselected group. Usually we are most 
interested in finding how well the tests pick out the poorest 
workers from the whole group of employees in that job. This 
can be definitely determined only in case we test the whole group 
(or samples of the whole group). Otherwise, we are only dis- 
tinguishing the worst workers from the best workers; the real 
problem is to distinguish the worst ones from the mediocre and 
fairly poor ones. In general, then, with either applicants or 
present employees, tests should be tried out with a typical group 
representative of the whole range of individuals upon whom the 
test is finally to be used. 
One further point is to be mentioned regarding the experi- 
mental testing of applicants and present employees. Any test, 
success in which depends upon special training or experience
-P-A-G-E-74
  64 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
acquired in the particular job tested for, clearly cannot be tried 
out on present employees and then used on applicants. For 
example, a trade test obviously is unfair if it contains questions 
the answers to which high-class tradesmen in this particular 
plant know, but tradesmen in other plants do not know. Such 
a test might show excellent results in sorting out good and poor 
workers among the tradesmen already at work in this one shop, 
and still prove worthless and misleading if used to judge men from 
other shops. This sort of pitfall is an ever present danger which 
even competent test psychologists do not always wholly avoid. 
Sometimes the influence of the present job upon men’s ability 
to pass the test is very subtle and easily passes undetected. 
This consideration emphasizes the importance of trying out tests 
in part or wholly upon applicants. Another way of meeting 
the difficulty just discussed is to have the test tried out 
co-operatively in several different shops. That was the method 
followed in constructing army trade tests. 
Our second question asked how many individuals need to 
be tested. A dogmatic answer is not possible. It all depends. 
It depends upon the nature of the individuals tested, the nature 
of the tests, the conditions under which the tests are conducted, 
the excellence of agreement between test results and the ability 
to be predicted, etc. One safe and important generalization can 
be laid down: The number of individuals tested should be 
large enough that the statistical results would not be significantly 
changed if we were to include in our results a large number of 
additional test scores from the same general group as that from 
which the first individuals came. The test expert can, by proper 
statistical methods, determine in any given case approximately 
how many individuals must be tested to satisfy this requirement 
after a fair portion of these data are available as a guide. Actual 
test studies have used anywhere from five or ten cases, which is 
decidedly too few, up to several hundred. The usual number 
runs from twenty to one hundred. 
a
-P-A-G-E-75
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD 65 
The third question—Under what conditions shall the tests 
be conducted ?—may be passed over with a word. The out- 
standing thing to be said is: The experimental conditions 
should in all essentials be as nearly identical as possible with 
those conditions under which the tests are finally to be used. 
This means that the same directions are to be used; so far as 
possible, the same attitude is to be created in the individuals 
tested; the same scoring method is adopted; physical surround- 
ings, personality of the tester, and the like, should be not greatly 
different; and so on through the list of conditions which have 
an effect upon test scores. 
| CRITERIA WITH WHICH TO COMPARE TESTS 
In order to determine the value of tests, predictions of 
ability from the test scores must be checked against some 
criterion. The tests are trying to tell what a man’s ability is 
for a given line of work. To see how well the tests succeed, we 
must know what the man’s ability actually is in the given work. 
There are in use two or three principal measures of that ability 
which we shall consider. 
The most obvious criterion for showing a man’s working 
efficiency is the record of his output. Under favorable circum- 
stances, individual production records doubtless constitute the 
best indication of ability on the job. These records are, more- 
over, very often available in convenient form. Especially in 
repetitive factory operations, such as occur in the use of auto- 
matic machine tools, in highly specialized assembling operations, 
in pasting, sorting, folding, packing, inspecting, and the like, 
individual production records are often kept as the basis for 
piece-rate wage payments. Not a few office and miscellaneous 
occupations also afford opportunity for obtaining a measure of 
output in terms of pages typed, bills checked, orders taken, 
amount of insurance written, etc. Production records may show 
either quantity or quality of output, or both. Quantity records
-P-A-G-E-76
    66 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
are more used than are those of quality, though the two are 
frequently combined in arriving at an index of productive 
efficiency. As examples of quality records may be mentioned 
errors in typewriting, filing, computing work, and the like; and, 
in factory operations, the amount of waste material and the 
frequency with which work fails to pass inspection. Individual 
accident records have also been used as a criterion, as in the case 
of street-car motormen. 
A few of the dangers to be guarded against in the use of 
production records as measures of ability should be mentioned. 
In the first place, reasonable assurance is necessary that workers 
have sufficient incentive to produce. Otherwise the records 
show, not what the individuals can do, but what they happen to 
feel like doing. Again it is important to know whether the units 
of work turned out are equivalent. If they are not (for example, 
if a typist’s ability is measured by the number of letters written, 
including letters of various lengths), then precautions must be 
taken to make allowance for the unequal units by averaging 
output over long periods or weighting the units in some way. 
It is necessary, further, to know that individual production is not 
markedly influenced by conditions beyond the worker’s control, 
as would be true, for example, if workers are forced to wait for 
materials. Another danger is that the production records if 
taken over considerable periods, say week by week, may be thrown 
off by absences of the worker from his work. Hence hourly 
or daily averages are preferable. Precautions must also be 
taken to see that the records of workers involved are strictly 
comparable—that they are performing identical tasks under 
identical conditions, and that the effects of longer experience on 
the job are allowed for. These are a few of the more important 
difficulties that must be met. With proper care, this can 
frequently be done, and in that case the records of produc- 
tion are an excellent criterion against which to check the test 
findings.
-P-A-G-E-77
  SCIENTIFIC METHOD 67 
In many occupations, production records are out of the 
question. This is true wherever work is varied from individual 
to individual, and wherever the tasks of any one individual are 
not constant and repetitive. The most practicable measure of 
individual efficiency in these cases is the estimate of ability 
made by supervisors or superior executives. Estimates of this 
sort—‘ratings” of ability, they are usually called—have been 
widely used, and have proved fairly satisfactory where sufficient 
care has been employed in obtaining them. Several kinds of 
rating scales—devices for recording the estimates or opinions— 
have been developed, but it is not necessary for us to consider 
these in any detail. The aim in all cases is to obtain a reliable 
and quantitative indication of the abilities of the individual 
workers. Experience has demonstrated that if reliable ratings 
are to be gotten, it is usually necessary to have three or more 
raters give independent estimates of each man’s ability. All of 
the rating executives must, moreover, know intimately the indi- 
vidual rated. Many additional safeguards have been found desir- 
able in the use of rating methods, and with these the test expert 
needs to be thoroughly familiar. To describe the rating scales 
in use would, however, take us too far into technical detail. 
The simplest rating method, and probably the best, where it 
can be used, is the mere ranking of the individuals from highest 
to lowest with respect to their ability in the work they are doing. 
Then their ranking by test scores can be directly compared with 
this ranking by supervisors. 
in addition to production records and supervisors’ estimates 
of ability, a criterion with which test results are occasionally 
compared is the length of service or period of employment of 
individuals. It is almost always supplementary to one of the 
other two criteria, rather than alternative to them. The purpose 
in finding the relation of test to these turnover figures is to see 
whether individuals with low, medium, or high scores are leaving 
the job especially rapidly or in especially large numbers. If the   
     
-P-A-G-E-78
    68 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
turnover is great, for example, among individuals having low 
scores, and also those having high scores, while not great among 
those with medium scores, the conclusion might be justified that 
neither low-score nor high-score individuals should be employed 
for this narticular job. There is, of course, danger of jumping 
to an unjustified conclusion in this way. The situation would 
call for further investigation. Perhaps the thing to do is not to 
begin rejecting the high-grade applicants, but to change the 
conditions of work or pay so as to hold these people once they 
are employed. The checking of tests against turnover figures is, 
in any case, likely to be a worth-while supplement to the compari- 
son of the scores with either production records or ratings by 
supervisors. 
ASCERTAINING THE RESULTS FROM THE EXPERIMENTAL 
USE OF THE TESTS 
The test scores and the measures of individual ability on 
the job constitute the concrete experimental data upon which 
conclusions regarding the value of the tests must be based. The 
process of arriving at conclusions is primarily a matter of statisti- 
cal procedure. The problem is simply to work out quantitatively 
the relation existing between the test scores made by the indi- 
viduals in the group and the corresponding efficiency ratings of 
those individuals. In other words, it is necessary to ascertain 
what degree of agreement there is between ability in the tests 
and ability on the job. Do individuals scoring high prove to 
be better workers than those scoring lower? Do those scoring 
very low turn out to be pretty uniformly the incompetent 
workers? Precisely how close is this relationship? There are 
two principal ways of working out this problem statistically. The 
one uses the correlation method; the other makes percentage 
comparisons between groups of poorer and better workers. 
The logic of the two methods is essentially the same. Only the
-P-A-G-E-79
  
SCIENTIFIC METHOD 69 
barest indication can be given here of the nature of these statisti- 
cal procedures." 
First let us consider a simple example of the correlation of 
test scores with supervisors’ ratings. Table I gives the data

obtained from the experimental testing of nineteen office em- 
ployees with a mental alertness (general aptitude) test and the 
ranking of these nineteen individuals by two supervisors. A 
rank of “1” is highest and “19” is lowest. In case of a tie, 
tA large part of the scientific literature on tests is devoted to statistical 
analyses of test results. Among the many books on statistical method which are 
valuable for workers in the field of tests, the following may be mentioned: H. O. 
Rugg, Statistical Methods Applied to Education; W. A. McCall, How to Measure in 
Education; G. U. Yule, Introduction to the Theory of Statistics; T. L. Kelly, Statis- 
tical Method; W. Brown and G. H. Thomson, Essentials of Mental Measurement; E. 
L. Thorndike, An Introduction to the Theory of Mental and Social Measurements.
-P-A-G-E-80
    7° PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
both individuals receive the same rank. For example, employees 
G and H both scored 50 points and are tied for the seventh and 
eighth places. They are given their average rank, 7.5. The 
agreement in this table is seen to be fairly close between the 
ranking according to test scores and that made by the supervisors. 
The correlation coefficient, now, is merely a convenient number 
which can be calculated statistically to tell how close this agree- 
ment is. The coefficient is readily obtained from the rankings 
contained in the last two columns of the table. There are other 
methods of computing correlation coefficients that are especially 
valuable when we wish to use the actual test scores and actual 
measures of productive efficiency instead of the rankings of 
individuals. The correlation coefficient is zero when there: is 
no agreement at all between the two columns compared; it is 
plus 1.00 if the two columns agree perfectly; it is minus 1.00 if 
the rankings of the two columns run in precisely opposite direc- 
tions, that is, if the individual ranked “‘r” in the tests is ranked 
“19” in the ratings, and soon. The correlation coefficients are 
always decimals, falling somewhere between minus 1.00 and plus 
1.00. The coefficient actually found from the table was plus’.76. 
This is somewhat higher than coefficients usually obtained 
between test scores and ability on the job, due to special condi- 
tions which need not concern us here. 
The significance of the correlation procedure for test purposes 
will be clearer if we interpret itin terms of prediction. After 
all, the whole purpose in obtaining test scores is to use them in 
predicting the ability of the individuals tested. And the closer 
the agreement between the scores and the actual ability of 
the individuals, the more accurate and reliable our predictions. 
Correlation coefficients measure this agreement and hence 
measure, also, the accuracy and reliability with which we can 
predict individual ability on the job from the test scores. The 
higher the coefficient, the better the predictions. Clearly, if 
the correlation coefficient is 1.00, the prediction is perfectly   
      
  
      
  
     
-P-A-G-E-81
SCIENTIFIC METHOD 71 
accurate, for we know that the individual who is highest in the 
test will invariably be highest in working efficiency. (Of course, 
coefficients of 1.00 are never gotten.) If, on the other hand, the 
correlation is zero, then our predictions are no better than purely 
chance guesses. If the coefficient is between zero and 1.00, the 
predictions are better than pure guesses but are not unerring. 
The interpretation of a correlation coefficient of a given size is 
a difficult technical matter into which we need notenter. Corre- 
lation figures must be used with insight and conclusions based 
upon them must be cautiously drawn. Correlation is a con- 
venient tool for judging the predictive value of tests, but only 
when it is in the hands of an expert. 
One example only will be given to indicate the danger in an 
uncritical use of coefficients of correlation in test work. The 
size of the coefficient is tremendously influenced by the nature 
of the group involved. The same test may very well correlate 
with the ability of clerical workers in one office to the extent of 
-75, and give a correlation coefficient of perhaps .30 when used 
with a different group of clerks. The theoretical reasons for 
this need not detain us. The fact simply is that the coefficient 
is much larger where the people tested show great difference in 
ability among themselves, and is smaller where the individuals 
scatter over only a narrow range of ability. 
Our conclusion regarding the correlation procedure is this: 
It is decidedly useful in the hands of the expert who understands 
it, but it is very easy to misuse and to misinterpret. For the 
individual without statistical training, our warning is, ‘‘ Distrust 
correlation coefficients! But trust the truly expert opinion 
based on them.” 
Simple percentage comparisons frequently are more valuable 
in test evaluation than are elaborate correlations. Even where 
correlation coefficients are computed, percentage comparisons 
are likely to be decidedly valuable supplements. There is in a 
percentage statement, like the following, a direct and readily   
   
-P-A-G-E-82

92 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
understandable meaning not present in correlation figures: 
Of all the individuals scoring below 28 on this test, 85 per cent 
failed and 15 per cent succeeded, whereas among those scoring 
above 28, 74 per cent succeeded and only 26 per cent failed. 
A statement of this sort tells pretty clearly what results will be 
obtained from the use of the test. In practice, we are almost 
always concerned particularly either with the problem of how 
well we can detect the poor workers or with the problem of 
selecting the best workers, and are not so much interested in the 
excellence of differentiation at the other extreme of test scores. 
Percentage comparisons are thus especially useful in showing 
how well predictions can be made at some particular part of the 
total range of test scores.

psychological tests. Solid circles represent individuals who proved to be unsatis-

*Adapted from an article by L. L. Thurstone in the Journal of Educational Psychology, March, ror9. 
Graphic methods are especially revealing in making compari- 
sons of the sort just discussed. The results of a test tryout can 
be clearly pictured, for example, in a chart like that shown 
in the accompanying figure. This figure shows the results 
obtained in the tryout of a test group used to predict the ability 
of college students in their college work. Obviously the method 
would be identical in representing the value of tests for an

industrial occupation. Each individual is represented by a 
circle placed above the particular test score he made. ‘The test 
scores, as shown, range from 1 to 27. Students who have fallen 
below a certain standard of scholastic work are represented by 
solid black circles. All other students are represented by the 
unshaded circles. The chart shows that most of the unsatis- 
factory students are ones who made low test scores. Or, to 
use a more precise comparison, of the 15 individuals with a score 
below 9, not a single one made good; above that score 87 per 
cent made good (85 out of 98). 
DECIDING WHETHER TO USE THE TESTS TRIED OUT 
The decision regarding the choice of tests is based upon the 
statistical findings. But certain other considerations will play 
apart. Such matters as the ease with which a test can be given, 
the time it requires, the expense of giving it, the urgency of the 
need for some test, and many other incidental factors may be 
fairly important at times in reaching a practical decision, but 
it is not our intention to deal with these issues. Aside from 
such considerations, how good must the statistical results be 
to justify the adoption of a particular test? Again the answer 
is, “It all depends.” It depends on the care with which the 
tryout was conducted, the accuracy of the criterion with. which 
the test scores have been compared, the extent to which the 
experimental conditions were identical with the conditions under 
which the test is to be used, the number of people tested, and so 
on. But more important than all these, it depends upon the 
competitors this test has. How well are other devices and 
methods of selection working without this test? Does this test 
add anything useful to the information already obtained about 
an applicant as a basis for accepting or rejecting him? Are 
there any other tests that do as well as this test does? In a 
word, the decision as to the use of a test must depend upon 
the answer to the question: Is the proposed process of selecting
-P-A-G-E-84
  74 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
individuals for this job (including the use of this test) appreciably 
better, cheaper, or more expeditious than any reasonable alternative 
method that is available? The statistical evidence concerning 
the test does not settle the question. It is merely the most 
important single item of information that enters the final decision. 
But there is no automatic way of making sound judgments. 
SETTING TEST STANDARDS 
Before a test can be made part of the employment procedure, 
standards or norms must be established by which to interpret 
individual scores. The simplest method is to specify, on the 
basis of the experimental results, a “critical score” or “dead 
line,” and then refuse to hire applicants who fall below the score. - 
Provided this lower critical score or standard is wisely set, and 
provided above all that it is interpreted with good judgment, 
it has much to recommendit. An upper critical score or standard 
to denote applicants of special promise may similarly be used. 
Or, on occasion, an upper critical score may be set for the purpose 
of keeping out of a particular job those individuals who score 
too high. A man can be too good for a job as well as not good 
enough. But typically, test standards are set for the elimination 
of low-score individuals or the special selection of those making 
high scores. 
Instead of having a single critical score, it is often desirable 
to have a series of standards or “norms” specified. Thus, for 
example, the total range of scores may be divided into five 
classes in such a way that an applicant may immediately be 
classified, as far as his test score goes, as ‘Far above average,” 
“Above average,” “Average,” “Below average,” or “Far below 
average’’—or simply as in Class A, B, C, D, or E. Sometimes it 
is useful to make even finer differentiations, in which case one 
of the most effective methods is to give the individual a “per- 
centile score.” The percentile score tells simply what percentage 
of all men hired for the job (or, perhaps, what percentage of present
-P-A-G-E-85
  
err ae 
SCIENTIFIC METHOD 75 
employees in this job) make a score lower than the individual 
under consideration. Thus, his “raw” test score may be 156, 
which, taken alone, means nothing; but his percemtile score, we 
are told, is 88, and that means that 88 per cent of the men in 
this job make a score lower than 156. The individual is thus 
placed at once with respect to the general run of men in this work. 
Still other methods of expressing test scores are in use, but they | 
are of less practical significance. 
Test standards cannot be set and then left forever to take care 
of themselves. The norms should be checked from time to time, 
especially during the early stages in the use of the test, and 
whenever necessary revisions should be made. The same con- 
sideration applies to the matter of verifying the test to see if it 
is operating successfully. Even though the test was carefully 
experimented with in a preliminary tryout and found reasonably 
successful, results obtained in actual practice should be checked 
now and then to see how well the test scores are actually indicat- 
ing the ability of men hired. Only after repeated checks can 
the value of the test be accepted as conclusively demonstrated, 
and the standards viewed as finally established. 
SCIENTIFIC CONSIDERATIONS IN USING TESTS 
After the selective test has been experimentally evaluated 
and approved, it is made part of the employment routine. 
The particular manner in which testing fits into the procedure 
of a given employment office is necessarily determined largely 
by local conditions. The tests should be administered by 
properly trained individuals, and should be conducted under as 
favorable conditions as possible, free from interference and 
interruption. Whether test results are to be interpreted and 
used by the tester himself or by employment interviewers, or 
whether all testing is to be done by the employment interviewer 
—these and similar questions must be decided in terms of the 
particular situation. Throughout the testing procedure there is 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
76 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
need for extraordinary tact, understanding, and regard for the atti- 
tudes and feelings of those tested. This is, of course, no less true 
during the experimental tryout of the tests than it is of their 
final use. All these matters we shall pass over with the mere 
mention of their very great practical importance. 
The combining of test scores with the results from other 
tests given the applicant, and with the other items of information 
accumulated in the employment interview, constitutes a final 
problem to be pointed out. It is perhaps the most important, 
and at the same time the knottiest, problem in the field of judging 
men’s abilities. How are we to piece together our partial 
pictures of a man to get a view of the individual in his complete- 
ness? How are we to weight the various elements in our size-up ? 
How are all the bits of knowledge about the man interrelated ? 
There is an elaborate statistical procedure (‘partial correlation” 
and “multiple correlation’) which attempts to throw light upon 
the problem. But even these methods break down when 
confronted with the actual complexity of the task. The best 
we can say is that the.devices, tools, and methods of the expert 
help a little in the attack upon these infinitely complicated and 
stubborn problems. In practice, the best we can do is use 
whatever scientific methods are available, add to these what- 
ever of common sense and sound judgment we can muster, 
and be ready to revise our judgments whenever new evidence 
appears.

CHAPTER III 
PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS FOR OFFICE 
OCCUPATIONS 
In order to appreciate the development and the present status 
of psychological tests in business, it is necessary that we have 
in mind a picture of recent progress in employment methods 
generally. Employment tests are a product of practical indus- 
trial needs quite as definitely as they are a natural outgrowth of 
the psychological study of the abilities of individuals. These 
two sets of forces—that from within psychology and that of 
practical demands—have worked together in the stimulation and 
shaping of psychological tests for business purposes. Regarding 
the influences from within psychology, nothing more need be 
said at this point. The significant fact is that rapid historic 
developments in the study of individual differences and their 
measurement have made possible a scientific attack upon indus- 
trial selection problems. The other set of influences demands 
closer consideration. If we are to see employment tests in 
perspective and be able to place a just valuation upon them, it 
is indispensable that we view them in relation to all other employ- 
ment practices and devices. 
THE RECENT HISTORY OF VOCATIONAL SELECTION IN 
INDUSTRY 
Employment methods have been undergoing a profound 
change during the last decade, a change which is best summarized 
in the expression “functionalized and centralized employment.” 
Scientific management, with its emphasis upon specialization 
and the separation of the various managerial functions, paved 
the way for the entrance of functionalized employment. The 
77
-P-A-G-E-88
  78 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
hiring and firing activities which were formerly the prerogative 
of individual foremen have, in an increasing number of plants, 
been taken out of the hands of foremen and concentrated under 
a staff department which deals exclusively with personnel duties. 
Hiring is usually one of the most important of these duties. 
Centralized employment necessitates the development of two 
bodies of basic knowledge—a knowledge of the requirements 
of the tasks for which men are being selected and a knowledge 
of the equipment of the individual worker. In the days of 
foreman hiring, the need for written standardized job specifica- 
tions was not felt, nor was the need for technical devices for deter- 
mining men’s abilities. Each foreman knew at first hand the jobs 
for which he was selecting men. Likewise, he could crudely 
ascertain the applicant’s trade skill by ‘asking questions or, as 
was more usual, by “trying him out.” Since records of employ- 
ment costs were not kept and since labor was ordinarily plentiful, 
it mattered little how effective the selection procedure proved. 
All this changes when costs and records are kept, when one 
centralized department is responsible for efficient selection, and 
when the importance of having ‘“‘the right man in the right 
place” has once been appreciated. 
Even where employment has not been functionalized or 
placed in a separate department, the problems of labor turnover 
and inefficient production have turned the attention of manage- 
ment sharply to the matter of improved selection methods. The 
obvious possibilities of adopting more careful interviewing 
methods and of utilizing various aids for interviewers, have 
led to marked progress, wholly aside from changes in the organi- 
zation for handling employment. The fullest use of scientific 
employment devices, however, has been pretty generally limited 
to centralized hiring departments. Among the devices and 
practices that have gained wide use as aids in sizing up men may 
be mentioned the application blank, the letter of recommendation, 
rating scales, psychological tests and trade tests, interest and
-P-A-G-E-89
  
TESTS FOR OFFICE OCCUPATIONS 79 
personal-history questionnaires, and careful personal interviews 
seeking to get at a real understanding of the applicant and his 
nature. Tests are to be recognized as only one item in the list 
of devices calculated to introduce greater precision and efficiency 
into the judgment of men in vocational selection. In actual 
practice the tests are always to be thought of as useful in con- 
nection with other methods, and not in isolation. Wherever 
movement is in progress toward more adequate methods of hiring, 
tests become part of a general program and are to be evaluated 
in terms of the part they play in that general program. 
The scientific attack upon the problem of selection methods 
is scarcely more than a decade old. The pioneer book in the 
field was Miinsterberg’s Psychology and Industrial Efficiency 
which appeared in 1913. The problems of vocational selection, 
it is true, had been prominent before this time among engineers 
in the field of scientific management, among vocational guidance 
experts, and within some few industrial plants. A small group 
of employment managers had begun meeting in Boston as early 
as 1910. But in none of these quarters had an effective effort 
been made to deal with the problems of vocational selection in 
any careful and scientific manner. 
Aside from Miinsterberg’s book, one of the most important 
contributions to the development of a psychology of vocational 
selection that appeared before the war was Blackford and New- 
comb’s The Job, the Man, and ihe Boss. In spite of the thoroughly 
anscientific and misleading character analysis methods included, 
this book proved distinctly valuable in drawing attention to the 
selection problem as it appears in its entirety to the employer, 
with healthy emphasis upon the human side of scientific manage- 
ment and upon individual differences and their utilization. 
During the war remarkable progress was made in meeting 
selection problems both in the armies and in industry, principally, 
though by no means exclusively, in the United States. More and 
more emphasis has come to be placed upon the use of quantitative
-P-A-G-E-90
80 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
methods, upon the importance of the job-analysis side of the 
problem, and upon a broad consideration of employment policies 
and methods in relation to business management and labor 
problems. In the United States Army in particular, unparalleled 
advances were made (in no small measure by professional psy- 
chologists) all along the line of scientific selection—studies of 
occupational requirements, methods of interview, use of general 
intelligence tests, special vocational tests, trade proficiency tests, 
rating scales, and records of individual qualifications and progress.‘ 
In the years immediately following the war, personnel work 
continued its rapid expansion and many psychologists entered 
industry as personnel workers, as consultants, or as students in 
pursuit of special researches. In part there has been an effort 
to bear to industry the methods used in the army, and in part 
the attempt has been made to develop new tests and other 
employment devices. Much of this work has supplemented in 
a valuable way the practical procedures that had been developing 
inindustry. The net result of the combined research and applied 
activities has been a decidedly significant body of material in 
scientific employment methods. The more important features 
of these industrial selection methods, bringing together the 
experience of the army and of industry, are described in many 
of the recent books on employment and personnel and in numer- 
ous special articles.” 
«The direction of progress in the industrial use of psychological methods of 
selection may be seen by a comparison of Miinsterberg’s Psychology and Industrial 
Efficiency with Hollingworth’s Vocational Psychology and Link’s more recent 
Employment Psychology. The development of selection methods is well reported 
in the committee reports published in the annual proceedings of the National 
Association of Corporation Schools. Valuable accounts of the achievements in 
the army are to be found in two official publications: Personnel System of the 
United States Army (Adjutant General’s Department) and “Psychological Examin- 
ing in the United States Army” (Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences, 
Vol. XV). More popular accounts of parts of the army work appear in Army 
Mental Tests, by Yoakum and Yerkes, and in Trade Tests, by Chapman. 
2 Among the more significant books are the following: Tead and Metcalf, 
Personnel Administration; Shefierman, Employment Methods; Frankel and Fleisher,
-P-A-G-E-91
    TESTS FOR OFFICE OCCUPATIONS 8r 
The fortunes of the newer employment methods, and particu- 
larly of psychological tests, have shown a marked tendency to 
rise and fall with changing business conditions. There can be 
little doubt, however, that the application of psychological 
methods to the selection of industrial workers has gained a 
permanent place in the increasingly important movement to 
regard the human element in business. A certain amount of 
“overselling’’ of the possibilities of psychological selection must 
be lived down; a considerable body of unscientific work must be 
scrapped; a more vital grasp of the employment problem in its 
industrial setting must be obtained; a host of painstaking and 
thorough researches must be pushed to completion. But the 
essentials of the movement are sound. The unfortunate quack- 
ery and charlatanism that always cling about a new movement 
must not blind us to the kernel of permanent values inherent in 
the development of scientific selection methods. 
PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS AS ONE DIVISION OF SCIENTIFIC 
SELECTION METHODS 
Against this general background of employment develop- 
ments we are now to project a picture of accomplishments in 
the use of tests. Tests constitute the most distinctively psy- 
chological contribution to vocational selection. But, as we 
have emphasized, they are by no means the whole of scientific 
selection nor are they to be thought of as alternatives to such 
other methods as careful interviews and ratings, and detailed 
application blanks. Where employment tests havebeen standard- 
ized and scientifically evaluated they are decidedly valuable parts 
of the selection machinery; but they are not the whole of the 
machinery.

Personnel Relations in Industry. Along somewhat similar lines but with greater 
psychological emphasis may be mentioned: Scott and Clothier, Personnel Manage- 
ment; Link, Employment Psychology; Scott and Hayes, Science and Common 
Sense in Working with Men; Reilly, The Selection and Placement of Employees. 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  82 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
Tests as selective devices have been especially popular since 
the war. Before 1917 vocational tests were a hope, an interesting 
possibility, with, it is true, a few scattered pieces of research 
asa basis. The war gave a radically changed status to test work 
and made practicable much of what had been merely possible. 
After the Armistice (and, in a few instances, before) tests and 
testers invaded industry. Progress has been made slowly. 
Selective tests adapted to industrial needs are still few; the move- 
ment is still immature; future possibilities are still uncertain. 
This is entirely healthy and normal if we recall the recency of 
the birth of scientific vocational selection. The danger—the 
aspect that is not healthy or promising—is the overselling of 
tests, the tendency to dwell upon advantages and successes and 
gloss over defects and failures, the tendency to speak of selective 
tests as an accomplished fact and not as a valuable field for 
experiment. The way to overcome these dangers is obviously 
through the accumulation of a body of knowledge based on facts 
concerning test results. Such facts are gradually being collected 
by test psychologists and employment experts in a number of 
progressive firms where tests are being put to the test. 
Many experimental tryouts of vocational tests have been 
reported in the literature of psychology and employment manage- 
ment. We shall bring together in the following pages the more 
important of these test studies. In the present chapter we shall 
deal only with tests for office occupations, leaving for later treat- 
ment a similar survey of test studies concerned with factory and 
sales occupations and others. 
TESTS FOR OFFICE OCCUPATIONS 
Greater progress has been made in the use of selective tests 
for office occupations than for any other class of vocations. 
The tests used have in the main been those of general intelligence 
and those of special acquired proficiencies, although a few 
attempts are also on record of tests to detect special aptitudes
-P-A-G-E-93
  TESTS FOR OFFICE OCCUPATIONS 83 
  
    for particular lines of office work. We shall review some repre- 
sentative studies of office occupations and shall indicate the lines 
along which progress has been made, emerging finally with some 
conclusions as to the success attained in the selection of office 
workers by means of tests. For convenience, tests for office 
occupations will be divided into the following three classes: (1) 
tests for clerical occupations; (2) tests for typists and stenogra- 
phers; (3) tests for other office occupations.   
  
      
TESTS FOR CLERICAL WORK 
Tests for general clerical work have been used in a large 
number of business establishments, apparently with considerable 
success. In some quarters they have been used mainly in 
experimental studies, but in a number of firms they have also 
become part of the routine method of judging applicants." 
Comparatively few reports are available, however, which give 
exact figures on the results obtained. But there is enough 
evidence to warrant a very favorable opinion as to the accomplish- 
ments and possibilities of tests in this field. 
The tests for non-specialized clerical work have consisted 
principally of general intelligence tests. In some instances 
adaptations of the usual intelligence tests have been made 
through the use of words, symbols, and examples from the 
clerical field. In addition to the general intelligence tests there 
«No complete tabulation of firms using different sorts of tests in a scientific 
fashion has been made. A few of the better-known companies which have tried 
out or used tests for clerical work are: American Rolling Mills Co., American 
Tobacco Co., Armstrong Cork Co., Atlantic Refining Co., Bell Telephone Co., 
Burroughs Adding Machine Co., Cheney Bros., Continental and Commercial 
National Bank, Curtis Publishing Co., Dennison Manufacturing Co., Eastman 
Kodak Co., Equitable Life Assurance Society, Marshall Field & Co., General 
Electric Co., Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., Joseph & Feiss, R. H. Macy & 
Co., Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., National Cash Register Co., National 
Cloak and Suit Co., Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Co., Sears, Roebuck & Co., 
Strawbridge & Clothier, Swift & Co., Western Electric Co., Western Union 
Telegraph Co., Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co., Winchester Repeat- 
ing Arms Co. Many of these same firms have tried tests for non-office occupations.
-P-A-G-E-94
  84 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
has been considerable use of tests of educational achievement— 
tests of proficiency in arithmetic, spelling, handwriting, and 
grammar. 
Illustrative examples of some tests and test results in the 
selection of general clerical workers will now be presented. 
We shall find that clerical tests have been studied (a) in relation 
to the individual efficiency of the people tested, (0) in rela- 
tion to the grade of clerical work being performed by the 
individuals, and (c) in relation to the stability of the workers 
or the length of time they remain on the job. We shall call 
attention to examples of each of these three kinds of comparisons 
in the course of our consideration of the following reports on the 
tryout of clerical tests. 
1. Probably the most widely influential tests for clerical 
occupations are the “ National Business Ability Tests.’”* These 
tests are almost entirely tests of educational attainment and not 
of natural aptitude. The tests have been devised and tried 
out under the supervision of a national committee which was 
organized in 1913. In 1914, twenty simple tests were tried in 
the employment offices of six large commercial organizations 
and, according to Cody, they “‘met with the unanimous approval 
of the employment managers of the houses that co-operated in 
the experiment.” The tests were later revised and experi- 
mentally administered in a large number of business establish- 
ments and schools, making possible the establishment of standards 
for scoring and for interpreting scores. Parallel series of equiva- 
lent tests have also been prepared from time to time. While no 
statistical evidence has been published to prove definitely the 
value of the tests, business firms which have used them seem to 
have found them decidedly worth while. In other words, we

of the history and theory of the tests, is given in Commercial Tests and How to Use 
Them, by Sherwin Cody. The book and copies of the tests are published by the

-P-A-G-E-95
  
TESTS FOR OFFICE OCCUPATIONS 85 
have here some general impressions of close agreement between 
tests scores and individual efficiency. How far these impressions 
are based on facts we do not know. 
The “National Business Ability Tests” include the following 
parts: (z) The applicant must tabulate items according to 
certain somewhat complicated conditions given in the instruc- 
tions. This is an attempt to get at general intelligence or mental 
alertness. (2) The applicant must memorize and later reproduce 
some detailed instructions concerning the use of sales slips. 
The test aims to measure memory and willingness to work hard. 
(3) The applicant must fill in some sales slips in accordance with 
instructions and facts given. It is considered to be an intelli- 
gence test. (4) The individual is tested in the fundamental 
arithmetical operations. This and all the remaining tests are 
definitely ones of educational attainment. They may be 
merely indicated by name. (5) Business arithmetic (fractions 
and percentage). (6) Tests in English (spelling, grammar, and 
punctuation). (7) and (8) Tests in letter writing. (9) Steno- 
graphic tests. (10) Test on copying for the mimeograph. 
(11) Test on addressing envelopes with a pen, and on filing. 
It is not, of course, assumed that all these tests are to be given 
to each applicant. Only those that are appropriate are used. 
2. More definite evidence of the value of tests given to clerical 
workers has been presented by other investigators. One psy- 
chologist,t for example, has showed that the results from the 
clerical examination which he used gave a better prediction of 
the ability of office workers than did the age and amount of 
schooling of the individual tested. This test aims to measure 
general intelligence, though in so doing it makes use of the 
language and material of clerical work, thus gaining in its interest 
appeal and apparent reasonableness. There are eight parts: 
™L, L. Thurstone, “Standardized Test for Office Clerks,” Journal of Applied 
Psychology, III (101), 248-sx1. The test materials are handled by the World 
Book Ca.

    86 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
(x) checking errors on a page of addition and subtraction prob- 
lems; (2) locating misspelled words in a printed passage; (3) 
canceling certain specified letters on a printed page; (4) learning 
a code; (5) alphabetizing a list of names in accordance with 
special instructions; (6) classifying insurance policies in a 
specified manner; (7) solving problems in arithmetic; (8) inter- 
preting the meaning of some proverbs. 
These tests have been standardized by giving them to about 
five thousand office clerks. The value of the tests was ascertained 
both by comparing test scores with the grade of clerical work 
being done, and by finding the degree of agreement of scores 
with individual efficiency. The first comparison was made by 
giving the test to one hundred employees in the office of an 
insurance company. The employees were rated in five classes 
according to the grade of office work they were doing. The test 
scores of the five different grades of employees were then com- 
pared and a considerable degree of agreement was found between 
the test rating of an employee and the level of work in which he 
wasemployed. This agreement was closer than was that between 
the grade of work and the combined items of age and amount of 
schooling. 
The second study of the value of these tests, comparing 
scores with individual efficiency ratings, is described in a later 
report." The test has been given to approximately twelve 
thousand clerks and has been put to a definite experimental 
check among five hundred clerks in a government office. The 
test scores of this last group were compared with their efficiency 
as clerks in the following manner: The clerks in each office 
division were ranked from best to poorest by their immediate 
superior. For each clerk there were available also a civil service 
efficiency rating, a record of education, and a record of salary. 
These four indicators of ability were combined to get a final

204-95.
-P-A-G-E-97
  TESTS FOR OFFICE OCCUPATIONS 87 
measure of each employee. The clerks who were above average 
in their standing were called good; those below average were 
called poor. When test scores were compared with these 
efficiency ratings, it was found that the people who made low 
scores in the test were usually the poor clerks, and those who made 
high scores were ordinarily the good clerks. In one group of 
twenty reviewing clerks, all but two of those above average in 
the test were good clerks; all but one below average in the test 
were poor clerks. The report states that, ‘What was true of 
the twenty reviewing clerks was found to hold approximately 
for the entire clerical force.” A table showing the relation of 
test scores to success as clerks is given below. It is to be read 
TABLE II 
Test Score errata 
  thus: Of all the clerks scoring between 20 and 40, only 9 per cent 
are good clerks (“good” defined as already explained) ; 33 per cent 
of those between 4o and 60 are good clerks; and so on. 
3. The reports of three or four other series of tests given to 
clerical workers contain somewhat similar evidence bearing upon 
the relation of test scores to individual efficiency. One study* 
reports the use of a mental alertness test (general intelligence 
test) given to several small groups of office employees, where 
comparisons were made between test scores of the individuals 
tA. W. Kornhauser, “Some Business ‘Applications of a Mental Alertness 
Test,” Journal of Personnel Research, I (1922), 103-21. This work is presented 
also in Scott and Clothier, Personnel Management. The part of the study which 
compares test scores and turnover figures is reported also by A. J. Snow, ‘Labor 
Turnover and Mental Alertness Test Scores,” Journai of Applied Psychology, 
VII (1923), 285-90.
-P-A-G-E-98
  88 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
and the estimated ability of these workers by their supervisors. 
Rather close agreement was found—sufficiently close to satisfy 
the management as to the value of the tests. In one office 
group of nineteen workers only one person below average on 
the test was rated above average by the supervisors and only 
one above average on the test was considered poorer than 
average by the supervisors. In another group of fourteen 
employees, every individual below average in the test was 
rated as below average by the supervisors, and everyone above 
average in the test was ranked as above average in efficiency. 
Such results are, of course, somewhat more favorable than is 
typical. 
Scores of clerical workers on this same mental alertness 
test have been studied in relation to grade of work and in relation 
to length of service. The relation of average scores to different 
classes of office work is shown in the following table. Interesting

differences between men and women office employees are inci- 
dentally to be noted. There is clearly a tendency here for people 
in the higher-grade occupations to have higher test scores. 
The relation between test scores and labor turnover was 
studied in two groups of clerical workers. A definite relation 
was found in both instances. In one case, both low-score and 
high-score individuals were leaving in larger numbers during the
-P-A-G-E-99
  
TESTS FOR OFFICE OCCUPATIONS 89 
first six months than were the employees with medium scores. 
In the other group, individuals with low scores and those with 
medium high scores were less permanent than those with medium 
scores or very high scores. Findings of this sort obviously 
require further investigation; they are the starting-points for 
detailed inquiries into conditions of work, wages, and other 
factors which cause employees to leave. It is equally clear 
that these results show something of the value of the tests. 
After all, success in a given job implies a fair degree of permanence 
in that work as well as a certain efficiency. Tests may be as 
important in giving predictions of the permanence of workers 
as in showing their efficiency. 
4. Another tryout of tests for clerical work was conducted 
by Link" at the Winchester Repeating Arms Co. A series of 
intelligence tests and also tests of “technique” were used, includ- 
ing such tasks as moving a metal pencil along a groove without 
touching the sides (test of steadiness), sorting cards, substituting 
letters according to a code, and solving arithmetic problems. 
In a preliminary experiment the results from a group of fifty-two 
office workers were compared with the opinions of the office 
head. According to the report, “The comparison showed a 
very marked agreement between the testimony of the tests and 
the rankings of the office manager.” It was decided to give the 
test to all clerks coming into the organization and to get follow-up 
ratings on the efficiency of these newly hired workers. Nine 
hundred and thirty-five clerks were tested in this way. “The 
results of this follow-up showed very clearly that the tests were 
an aid in the selection of clerks.” Statistical results are given 
for a group of 188 of these employees. The individuals were 
clerks recommended for employment on the basis of tests and 
then reported on by their supervisors each month for three 
months. The tabulation showing the percentage of those called 
good by their superiors is given in Table IV.

The most important point here is that the office heads agreed 
more and more with the test findings as they came to know 
their workers better.

5. There is another study’ in which evidence regarding the 
relation of test scores to grade of office work, to turnover among 
office employees, and to ratings of individual efficiency stands 
out very clearly. The test used was one of general intelligence, 
very similar to the one used in the army. 
The relation between test scores and grade of work is presented 
in the three tables which follow. In each case the classification 
begins with the least difficult jobs and ends with the most

medium scores were most permanent and those with high scores 
were least so. 
A more detailed analysis was made of the relation between 
scores and turnover for one group of 133 clerical workers. At

the end of two and one-half years, 63 of these people were still 
in the employ of the company. As a result of the sifting process 
that had taken place, there proved to be a clearer relation between 
test score and grade of work among the 63 workers than among the 
original 133. People with high scores had left the lower grade 
positions, and those with low scores had become less numerous 
in the higher grade work. The results indicate that mental 
alertness was a significant factor in the success of workers in 
these clerical positions. 
In another group a comparison was made of scores and indi- 
vidual efficiency ratings. Ninety office employees were rated 
by their superiors on a percentage scale. The relation between 
these ratings and average test scores is given in Table IX. Itis 
clear that those rated high tend to have high scores in mental 
alertness and those rated low tend to have low scores.

6. We shall give one example for a somewhat more specialized 
clerical test than those we have already described—a test for 
file clerks. The test consists of six parts, requiring such per- 
formances as the alphabetizing of names, the classifying of 
numbers, the comparing of pairs of names and numbers to deter- 
mine whether they are identical, the classifying of items of 
information under topical headings, and the answering of specific 
questions based upon paragraphs that are read. The tests aim 
to reach the several classes of file clerks—sorters, numerical 
filers, alphabetical filers, and subject classifiers. One hundred 
and twelve file clerks in four companies were given the tests.

The scores were compared with ratings of the clerks, based upon 
their ability and the class of work being done. The ratings were 
considered accurate in only one of the four companies, though 
even the inadequate ratings in two of the other companies are 
said to have agreed fairly well with the test scores. Forty-three 
clerks were rated in the company where the reliable estimates 
were obtained. Here, a very close relation was found between 
the ratings of ability and the test scores. The relation is 
indicated by the figures given in Table X. The general intelli- 
gence test did not work as well with these file clerks as did the 
special file clerk test, though even the former showed fairly good 
agreement.

7. In this final section of our report of the results obtained 
with clerical tests, we shall mention several miscellaneous 
pieces of work done by different investigators. 
The Section of Psychology in the United States Army 
conducted a minor study,’ with a group of civil-service clerks. 
Seventy-three clerks were tested with the army intelligence test. 
The scores were compared with the civil-service ratings obtained 
by these clerks at the time of their examination for entrance 
into the service. A fair degree of correlation was found. 
Within the last year or two the United States Civil Service 
Commission has adopted clerical tests of a psychological sort.?

Their new clerical tests include those in spelling, arithmetic, 
and penmanship, and those requiring the candidates to arrange 
names alphabetically, to check pairs of names to see if they are 
identical, to give the opposites of words, to classify items accord- 
ing to a code, and so on. The tests were tried on ninety clerks 
and the scores were compared with their efficiency ratings. 
“The examination scores were found to differentiate very satis- 
factorily between those rated high and those rated low in effi- 
ciency.” ‘The relation of the new tests to efficiency was closer 
than was that of the old civil-service examinations, and was 
also closer than were such items as age, schooling, and amount of 
experience. 
Mental alertness tests were tried on a group of general clerical 
workers in a large rubber factory by one investigator. The 
employees were rated in efficiency by the department heads 
under whom they worked. Here, too, a fair degree of correlation 
was found. 
In another study? clerical workers in a New York depart- 
ment store were given a long series of tests. Some relation- 
ship was found between test scores and ability as estimated 
by supervisors. It also proved possible to differentiate fairly 
well on the basis of the tests between clerical workers and sales 
persons. 
A German investigator’ gave a series of clerical tests consisting 
essentially in the finding of names and words in directories and 
dictionaries. The author states that the test scores agreed well 
with the efficiency of the workers.

TESTS FOR OFFICE OCCUPATIONS 95 
A number of other studies" report results more or less similar 
to the ones we have considered. In almost all cases a fairly 
high degree of correlation is found between scores on the intelli- 
gence o; mental alertness tests and measures of the working 
efficiency of the people tested. One investigator? found no 
significant relation between scores made by a group of express 
clerks and their success at work. This study, however, stands 
alone in its negative results. 
TESTS FOR CLERICAL WORKERS—-SUMMARY 
Our ‘reason for mentioning all these studies should be clear. 
Results from any one investigation in the use of tests for voca- 
tional purposes are likely to be true only within the particular 
groups studied and under the particular set of circumstances. 
It is only when we find certain tests working successfully in 
many different groups and situations within an occupation that 
we can safely conclude that the tests are good tests for that 
occupation. In the case of tests for clerical work, results have 
rather consistently pointed to the value of general intelligence 
tests and adaptations of these. The same is true of appropriate 
tests for educational achievement. 
In addition to the actual evidence favorable to intelligence 
and educational tests as aids in selecting clerical workers, there 
is much that may be said on common-sense grounds in support 
of such tests. This is particularly true if we recall all the 
scientific evidence that is available concerning these tests in 
t Among others, there are the following studies: C. S. Carney, “‘Some Experi- 
ments with Mental Tests as Aids in the Selection and Placement of Clerical Workers 
in a Large Factory,” Conference on Educational Measurements, Indiana University, 
V (1919), 60-74; F. C. Henderschott and F. E. Weakley, The Employment Depart- 
ment and Employee Relations. Chicago: LaSalle Extension University, 1918}

non-business fields. Both intelligence tests and educational- 
achievement tests have been widely standardized and verified 
in the schools, as means for ascertaining the present advancement 
(educational tests) and potential capacities (intelligenve tests) 
of the pupils in the work of the schoolroom. If these tests are 
thus useful in determining the arithmetical and spelling ability 
of students in the schools and in predicting their ability to learn 
and progress in such studies, the inference is not unreasonable 
that the tests will prove similarly useful in diagnosing the present 
and future abilities of clerical employees whose work is made up 
largely of just such school subjects. In other words, there is 
strong presumptive evidence in support of —_— and 
educational tests as useful for diagnosing the abilities of clerical 
workers. 
If we combine all the available facts bearing upon tests for 
clerical employees, a very favorable conclusion is justified. 
We do not, of course, mean that tests are completely satisfactory 
in this field or that there is not need for a great deal of further 
research and improvement of test methods. Still less do we 
imply that tests are sufficiently accurate and reliable to warrant 
the abandonment of other methods of ascertaining the abilities of 
applicants, such as careful interviewing. What we do mean is 
that the evidence in support of intelligence and educational 
tests for clerical work is great enough to warrant the use of these 
tests as one device which, properly used, will aid in judging the 
merits of clerical workers. At the same time the use of the tests 
is to be viewed as experimental. That is to say, new standards 
must be established in each company where the tests are to into 
use and, as soon as feasible, the results from the tests must be 
checked and verified. | 
Our general conclusion, then, regarding tests for clerical 
workers is that they are of considerable value. While ie is wise 
to work out the specific degree of their value in each particular 
situation in which they are used, sufficient evidence is available 
|
-P-A-G-E-107
  TESTS FOR OFFICE OCCUPATIONS 97 
to create a strong presumption in their favor and to warrant’ 
high hopes for their further perfection. We shall find that far 
less can be said in support of all other occupational tests. 
TESTS FOR TYPISTS AND STENOGRAPHERS 
A clear distinction is to be drawn between tests of present 
proficiency in typing and stenography and tests of aptitude or 
potential ability for becoming successful in these occupations. 
The examinations in proficiency are simply short standardized 
trials on the job or samples of what the individual can do. 
They are really “trade tests.” They test the typist by asking 
her to type. Obviously, however, such a test is not useful in 
predicting which individuals can be trained to become good 
typists. To make this diagnosis of potential ability, aptitude 
tests are needed which do not depend upon any acquisitions in 
typing. 
Proficiency tests in typing and stenography may be very 
briefly dealt with. They are the most common-sense sort of 
tests. Actual trials at typing and shorthand transcribing have, 
in unstandardized form, been widely used in employment. The 
standardized tests consist simply of appropriate material to be 
copied or dictated under prescribed conditions. Scoring methods 
and standards for comparison of scores have been established so 
that an individual can be given a definite rating in proficiency 
upon completion of the test. 
Tests of achievement in typing and stenography have been 
constructed and used in a number of places. Cody" gives a 
complete description of his tests in copying and in transcribing 
from dictation, including scoring methods and averages for 
comparison. The Army Trade Division constructed and 
standardized similar proficiency tests, one for typists and one 
for stenographers. Other standardized tests of this sort have 
been made by Thurstone, The Scott Co., Link, and others. More

‘or less similar tests have been in use by many typewriting 
companies, schools for the training of typists and stenographers, 
and private business organizations. The importance of careful 
standardization and establishment of the value of the tedts has, 
however, frequently been neglected. 
In addition to these simpler tests in typewriting and stenogra- 
phy, a carefully worked out series of standardized tests for 
proficiency in shorthand has been reported by one investigator." 
There is a test for ability to read shorthand, a test for speed in 
writing shorthand, a test for shorthand penmanship, and a test 
for knowledge of the shorthand system. All these tests have 
been tried out on large numbers of students of shorthand and 
results have been obtained to show that the tests are fairly satis- 
factory in revealing differences in proficiency among individuals. 
When we turn to aptitude tests for typists and stenographers, 
evidences of successful and consistent results are not plentiful. 
Some investigators have gotten quite promising results, but 
others using similar tests have failed to secure useful predictions 
of ability. There is thus a striking lack of the consistency which 
we emphasized as important in clerical test results. On the 
whole, however, the tests for typewriting have been far from 
discouraging. Sufficient progress has been made to justify the 
belief that further experimenting will bring accomplishments of 
proved value. Some of the more promising investigations will 
be sketchily presented in the following pages. 
x. Among the earliest studies of tests for typewriting aptitude 
was that of Lahy.? Eleven experienced typists were tested with 
a series of special tests. The scores were compared with actual 
typing proficiency as demonstrated in a typewriting test. Four

Guidance.

of the aptitude tests showed a high degree of relationship to 
ability in typing. These were tests involving immediate memory 
for-concrete phrases, ability to grip equally strongly with the 
two hands, fineness of touch sensibility, and ability to judge 
slight differences in lifted weights. These four tests in combina- 
tion gave a very close prediction of typewriting efficiency among 
the eleven people tested. 
2. Another investigator’ experimented with a group of 
students in a commercial high school, correlating test results 
with the abilities shown in school subjects. The test used was 
one in which the pupils had to substitute letters for one another 
in accordance with a code, the score being dependent upon the 
ability of the individual to improve in the rate of his performance. 
Fairly high correlations were found between the test and teachers’ 
ratings of the pupils in typing, stenography, and business 
correspondence. There is some evidence, however, that the 
agreement is due to the teachers having estimated the general 
ability of the pupils rather than their specific ability in typing. 
3. Several other studies have been more convincing than the 
foregoing. One experimenter? used a series of association tests 
with a group of forty-five students of typing and stenography. 
The tests consisted of such tasks as giving the opposites of words, 
naming colors in rapid succession, following complicated direc- 
tions, substituting digits for geometrical forms according to a 
code, and so on. Measures of ability for the individuals tested 
were obtained as follows: In stenography a mid-year examination 
was given on the basis of which the students were graded as to 
their proficiency. In typewriting an achievement test was 
conducted once a month in which the individuals had to write 
from dictation under standardized conditions. Several of the

of the 
  ’ aptitude tests showed fair agreement with the attainmen’ 
students in typing and stenography. The tests which correlated 
best with typewriting were on the whole those which renee 
poor agreement with stenographic ability, and vice versa. 
Combinations of three or four tests were found which showed 
good correlations with stenographic ability and other combina- 
tions gave about equally close predictions of typing ability. 
The tests were also tried upon two groups of typists in a 
commercial establishment—one group of thirty-eight individuals 
who had worked in the same office division for at least ten months, 
and another group of sixty-five who had worked a shorter period. 
Records of output were obtained for typists in these groups in 
terms of the average number of sheets written per day. Test 
scores were then correlated with the production records. The 
agreement was a little less for these groups than for the student 
group, but results are well in accord with one another. 
4. In another investigation,’ tests were tried out on a large 
number of typists and stenographers in an industrial plant and 
found to give useful results, though the statistical evidence has 
not been published. Aside from proficiency tests in actual 
typing and transcribing, the tests used consisted of the follinatnad 
tests in spelling and grammar, a substitution or code test, and a 
test requiring the individual to supply omitted words in sentences. 
The individuals tested were twenty-two office typists, nineteen 
stenographers, and over four hundred candidates for positions 
as typists and stenographers. The author states that the tests 
have “proved themselves practical guides in the selection and 
grading of applicants.” 
5. Im still another study? an attempt was made to find tests 
which would be useful in predicting the abilities of applicants

for a training course in stenography. It was desired to eliminate 
failures and also to select individuals who would certainly be 
successful. Three tests were given to the students in the 
stenographic courses (eighty-four individuals). The tests com- 
prised one of general intelligence, one designed to show special 
aptitude in stenography and typewriting, and a “will- 
temperament test” which aims to get at certain qualities of 
character. Each of these tests is made up of several parts. 
Test scores were compared with the success of the students in 
their courses in typewriting and stenography. A person was 
considered a failure if her teachers did not recommend that she 
continue work in her course or enter an advanced course. 
Twenty-six of the eighty-four students were rated as failures. It 
was found that by combining scores on significant parts of the 
tests, failures and successes could be selected with considerable 
accuracy. To what extent the same combinations and standards 
would hold for other groups we do not know. Further experi- 
mentation is needed. 
As a matter of fact, some later work* done by the same investi- 
gator did reveal the necessity for a change in the standards 
used. In order to test the results of the earlier study, three 
groups of stenographers in commercial organizations were 
tested. One group of twenty stenographers was rated by an 
executive as to their value to the firm. A high correlation was 
found between these ratings and the intelligence test. This, 
however, may have had little to do with any specific ability in 
typing or stenography. Similar results were obtained for another 
group of seventeen stenographers and eight secretaries. Decided 
differences in intelligence test scores occur between the secre- 
taries, stenographers rated as good, and stenographers who are 
just “getting by.” On the whole, the results show a marked 
relation between mental alertness test scores and ability in 
stenographic work.

6. An English investigator’ has studied the relation of a 
series of tests to the ability of thirty typists employed in a govern- 
ment office. This series included tests of general intelligence, 
attainment in spelling and arithmetic, language ability and 
general information, and a number of proficiency tests in type- 
writing and shorthand-writing. Test scores were compared with 
} rankings of the typists by their supervisor as to (a) their general 
office efficiency, (b) typewriting efficiency, and (c) efficiency in 
shorthand. The agreements between a number of the tests and 
ratings of efficiency are very close. It is to be noted, however, 
that the tests are largely ones of proficiency and not of aptitude. 
Correlations between the aptitude tests and the tests of actual 
achievement do not appear to be especially high. The author 
concludes, however, that “the results of the tests in the final 
form appear on the whole to be highly satisfactory.” He 
doubtless refers more particularly to the proficiency tests than 
to those of aptitude. 
7. Decidedly the most elaborate and thorough study of 
typing tests that has been made is the recent work of two British 
investigators.2 Especially worthy of note is their critical 
discussion of previous research in this field. ‘The inconsistency 
of the results of different investigations is especially stressed, thus: 
The test of “attention” (cancellation), the test of acquisition of associa- 
tions (substitution), and the tests of “‘intelligence,” have all yielded diver- 
gent results; one investigator obtaining a positive correspondence between 
typewriting efficiency and a given sort of test, and one or more investigators 
finding no such correspondence. . . . . Indeed, the only tests with which a 
particular investigator obtained results so far uncontradicted are tests that 
have so far not been tried by other investigators. 
The authors aimed in their own investigation to find suitable 
groups in which the test findings would not be thrown off by 
rC. Burt, “Tests for Clerical Occupations,” Journal of the National Institute 
for Industrial Psychology, I (1922), 23-27 and 79-81.

TESTS FOR OFFICE OCCUPATIONS 103 
unusual conditions of age, experience, and the like, or by unreliable’ 
ratings of the efficiency of the individuals studied. Ten different 
groups were used consisting of typists in business offices and 
commercial schools. A great variety of tests were tried which 
are grouped as follows: 
1. Attention (rapidity of observation) 
Cancelling letters on a page, finding numbers in a table, noting the 
identity of names, etc. 
2. Memorizing (acquiring associations) 
Substituting letters for forms according to a code, etc. 
3- Immediate memory span 
Reproduction of sentences and numbers after looking at them. 
4. Speed of association 
Giving words bearing a certain relation to suggested words. 
5. Intelligence 
Several typical intelligence or mental alertness tests. 
6. Tactile sensibility 
Discriminating by touch between cards having two, three, or four 
small holes punched in them. 
7. Motor capacity 
Strength of grip in the right and {eft hands; tests of manual dexterity 
and speed of finger movement; etc. 
8. Acquired associations (knowledge) 
Spelling and vocabulary tests. 
Asa criterion of the actual typewriting efficiency of the indi- 
viduals tested, ratings by their supervisors and teachers were 
used. Special effort was made to obtain as reliable gradings as 
possible. The correlation between test scores and the gradings 
in typing efficiency are found to vary greatly. Some of the tests 
show close agreement with ability as typists, but the relation is 
not consistently shown for the different groups. We cannot do 
better than quote in this connection a paragraph from the origi- 
nal report. 
The most important feature of the results is the variation in the size 
of the correlation coefficients obtained from different groups with identical 
tests—identical not only in principle, but often also in material. This 
simply upsets the usual procedure in vocational investigations; that is,
-P-A-G-E-114
  104 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
* the drawing of conclusions as to the vocational value of particular tests for 
specified occupations from coefficients obtained from a single group of 
industrial subjects. For there can be no doubt whatever that the size of 
a coefficient of a test with occupational efficiency is partly a function of 
the group to which the test is given. 
It is suggested by the authors of the report that the chief 
cause of the inconsistent results is the varying reliability of the 
efficiency gradings given in the different groups by different 
supervisors and teachers. This condition emphasizes the impor- 
tance of obtaining objective records of efficiency wherever 
possible, in place of personal estimates. Where objective 
records are not available, ratings may be increased in reliability 
by taking the average of estimates by several independent judges. 
The desirability of testing the test in more than one group is 
also clearly indicated. 
A second cause which is mentioned as an explanation of the 
variation in results is the fact of specialization within the occupa- 
tion of typists, and the requirements of different personal abilities 
in these different divisions of the occupation. ‘This difficulty 
calls attention to the necessity of using, in the experimental 
tryout of tests, groups that are as nearly as possible identical 
with the group to whom the tests are to be applied in actual 
practice. 
The writers under consideration conclude, on the basis of 
their own investigation and all preceding work, that there are 
five tests which show some possible indication of being useful in 
diagnosing typewriting aptitude. These are: (1) a test for 
reproducing sentences immediately after they are veal (2) a 
test in carrying out certain directions; (3) a test requiring the 
finding of the products of two numbers in a table made up for 
that purpose; (4) a test in which appropriate words must be 
supplied in a sentence containing blanks; and (5) a spelling test. 
8. Two still more recent studies of tests for typewriting 
aptitude have reported very favorable results—but with tests   
 
-P-A-G-E-115
  TESTS FOR OFFICE OCCUPATIONS 105 
different from any of those recommended as promising in the ‘ 
conclusions of the foregoing report. The first of these investiga- 
tions’ made use of two specially devised tests for typing ability 
and of five well-known word association tests. One of the special 
tests was a “serial typewriting reaction test” in which the 
individual tested had to respond to a sequence of numbers by 
striking appropriate keys of the typewriter. As soon as one key 
was struck the next number was given. A continuous series of 
reactions was thus called for which required both speed and 
accuracy. The other special test was a “typewriting rhythm 
test” which measured the ability to strike series of keys with 
rhythmic regularity. All the tests were given to two classes 
in typewriting, numbering twenty and twenty-two respectively. 
The tests were used before the individuals began learning to 
typewrite. The test scores were later compared with several 
different measures of the typing proficiency attained by the 
individuals tested. 
Very close agreement was found between some of the tests 
and achievement in typewriting in the two classes tested. Two 
of the association tests gave fairly promising results and the 
serial reaction test was exceptionally successful. The two best 
association tests were “form substitution” in which numbers 
must be written below geometrical forms in accordance with a 
code that is given, and a “‘color-naming test” in which the person 
tested must call out as rapidly as possible the names of one 
hundred bits of color arranged ona sheet of paper. By combining 
these association tests with the serial reaction test, the investi- 
gator found results about as favorable as have been obtained 
for any other occupations. The rhythm test worked very well 
with one group, but not with the other. Further experimenting 
with these tests will be well worth while.

tion is contained in an unpublished thesis at the University of Chicago.

9. The one other recent investigation’ which we shall hepa 
made use of a series of six tests with twenty students. Test 
scores were compared with actual typing proficiency. Three 
of the tests showed fairly good results. These were: (1) a test 
in speed of tapping, in which a typewriter key had to be struck 
over and over again in rapid succession; (2) a test in which the 
individual had to underline certain combinations of numbers 
and letters on a page containing rows of digits and letters; 
(3) a substitution test in which numbers were to be written 
beside symbols in accordance with a certain code. 
TESTS FOR TYPISTS AND STENOGRAPHERS—SUMMARY 
The selection of typists and stenographers on the basis of 
their present accomplishments is thoroughly feasible. Brief 
standardized tests in typing and shorthand-writing are readily 
constructed and used. There are a number of them on the 
market.?, These tests are a common-sense, and at the same time 
scientific, method of getting a sample of the applicant’s actual 
efficiency. A considerable number of business offices are making 
use of such tests as a regular part of their employment procedure. 
The selection of individuals with respect to their future 
possibilities in typing and stenographic work is a problem of : scam vastly greater difficulty. We have reported the more important 
attempts to solve this problem. While these studies have made 
a certain amount of progress, we are still unable to point with 
any great confidence to any test or set of tests which may be 
recommended for practical use in determining specific aptitude 
for typewriting and shorthand. No tests have been demon- 
strated to be consistently valuable. Certain tests show some 
relation, however, and these may well be tried experimentally

in different places with a fair promise that they will prove of © 
value. Intelligence tests, moreover, are useful among typists 
and stenographers, as among other workers, for indicating general 
adaptiveness and alertness aside from special abilities peculiar 
to the occupations. As to the more specific aptitude tests, we can 
say in conclusion only this: Enough work has been done to open 
up a promising field for research. We would advocate the use 
of tests for typing and stenographic aptitude—but only in case 
the emphasis is placed upon éesting the tests and not upon using 
the results for the present as measures of the applicants’ abilities. 
TESTS FOR OTHER OFFICE OCCUPATIONS 
Only a few studies of tests have been made for office occupa- 
tions other than those we have considered. Intelligence tests 
have occasionally been tried on executives and on office boys but 
few significant results have been published. There is good reason 
for assuming that with office boys these tests are of considerable 
value, arguing from what we know of mental testing of school 
children and the success of the tests in picking out the bright 
and dull. One or two studies of office boys and messengers and 
of executives may be briefly reported. 
The mental-alertness-test scores of messengers and office boys 
have been analyzed principally in relation to labor turnover. 
In one group which was studied, turnover was found to be high 
among the individuals making neither very high nor very low 
scores. Stability was greatest, in this company, among the boys 
with the highest scores. In another company, the scores of the 
boys who were discharged were compared with the average of 
those who were promoted. The former were decidedly lower. 
A more detailed report is given of the test results of 111 office 
boys whose records were studied about two years after the test 
scores had been obtained. The average score of the boys 
remaining with the company was higher than that of the boys 
* Scott and Clothier, op. cit; A. J. Snow, op. cit.  
-P-A-G-E-118
    
  PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
who had left, but the average of those who left to accept better 
positions was higher even than that of the group still employed. 
The discharged group averaged very low. The boys with high- 
est scores were receiving considerably higher salaries than were 
those with the lowest scores. It was found possible to set a 
“passing mark” in the test, which would differentiate fairly 
well between the boys who were successful and permanent as 
contrasted with those who were unsuccessful and likely to leave. 
Some agreement was also found between the test scores of the 
boys and the ratings of their abilities by executives. 
Material bearing on the results of tests for executives is 
meager. One experiment’ reports the tryout of a mental alert- 
ness test with 28 minor executives in a clothing manufacturing 
establishment. The 28 men were rated by six superior execu- 
tives. Exceptionally close agreement was found between the 
test scores and the ratings given the men by their superiors. 
In a recent study,? 102 business executives attending a con- 
ference in financial statistics were given an intelligence test. 
Experience records containing personal information about the 
individuals were obtained from 73 of these men. These records 
were used as a criterion with which to compare the test scores. 
No agreement whatever was found. 
Regarding these test studies of executives, it is important to 
recognize that there is a great difference between distinguishing 
good executives from less successful ones, and selecting executives 
from the general run of men. Tests may be of very little value in 
diagnosing the precise degree of executive ability an individual 
possesses, and still be highly useful in differentiating between the 
whole class of men who may become executives and those who 
probably are not sufficiently intelligent. The specific results 
thus far secured offer no sound basis for assuming that tests

can do more than give this very crude indication of executive © 
ability. Some psychologists are of the opinion that there is no 
hope of developing more accurate tests in this direction.* 
The only other office occupations to be mentioned are special- 
ized operations on office machines. Several investigations of 
this sort will be sketched. 
x. In one study’ a series of tests was given to three groups of 
over 140 operators of computing machines (comptometers and 
Burroughs adding machines), to more than 120 candidates for 
positions in this work, and to 80 pupils entering a class for 
instruction in the operation of computing machines. The tests 
found most useful, aside from a proficiency test in machine com- 
puting, were a mental arithmetic test and a test requiring the 
substitution of numbers according to a code. Intelligence tests 
did not show any marked correlation with ability as operators. 
On the basis of the tryout the several tests mentioned were 
deemed of sufficient value to be adopted for use in employment. 
Definite report of results is made for only one selected group 
of twelve individuals, in which group agreement between test 
scores and executives’ opinions was close. 
2. A second investigation, also dealing with comptometer 
operators, used tests of intelligence, a series of tests for aptitude 
in typing, and a test for volitional qualities Thirty-five 
comptometer operators in an evening class were tested, of whom 
fourteen were rated by their teachers as failures. A combination 
of the tests was found which picked out ten of these fourteen 
failures. Whether the same tests and standards would show 
equal success in other groups is not, of course, known.

cussion of tests for typists and stenographers (p. 100). The same tests were used.

3. In another study* several tests were tried out with a 
group of twenty-seven Elliott-Fisher bookkeeping-machine opera- 
tors. The work is a specialized sort of operation involving simple 
typing and computing. Fair agreement was found between two 
or three of the tests and the actual ability of the individuals in 
their work. No final conclusions can be drawn, however, from 
an investigation as limited as this. One interesting point in 
this study is that the number of years of schooling of the indi- 
viduals agreed as well as did test scores with their actual 
efficiency. How true this would be of other office groups is not 
known. 
4. In one experimental investigation? the intelligence test 
used in the United States Army was given to 106 graphotype 
operators in the Treasury Department in Washington. The 
tests showed no agreement at all with either the speed or ac- 
curacy of these workers. 
5. The final piece of work we shall mention is a study? of 
selective tests for Hollerith machine-card punchers.4 About 
130 experienced operatives were tested with a series of nine 
tests—mainly ones that are usually included as parts of a 
general intelligence test. Ratings of actual efficiency on the job 
were obtained for the individuals tested. The agreement be- 
tween test scores and the efficiency ratings is slight. It is never- 
theless true that a combination of three of the tests proved 
more valuable for predicting ability than did the civil service 
examination that had been in use.

  TESTS FOR OFFICE OCCUPATIONS cre 
These last studies of office-machine operations have added 
little to our positive knowledge of tests for office occupations. 
They are of interest primarily as indications of lines along which 
further more fruitful work may be expected. 
CONCLUSIONS REGARDING TESTS FOR OFFICE WORKERS 
Our general summary of what has been accomplished in the 
field of tests for office occupations can be very briefly stated. 
Most important is the methed that has been developed for use in 
further test research. The significance of this permanent 
contribution of technique is not to be lost sight of, whatever 
be the fate of the more concrete test achievements. 
As to the specific occupational tests we have considered in 
the foregoing pages, there is especially strong evidence in support 
of (a) general intelligence tests and tests of achievement in 
spelling, arithmetic, etc., as aids in selecting clerical workers; 
and (0) proficiency tests (trade tests) in typewriting and stenogra- 
phy. Tests of aptitude in these last occupations and also in 
computing-machine work show promise, but have not progressed 
far enough to warrant a positive indorsement. On the basis of 
research in non-business fields as well as in business, a favorable 
view of intelligence tests is justified as a device for indicating 
the alertness and future possibilities of various classes of office 
workers, ranging from office boys to secretaries and perhaps to 
minor executives. As research is continued and expanded we 
may hope gradually to see these promising beginnings grow into 
tich bodies of concrete accomplishment.

  CHAPTER IV 
PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS FOR NON-OFFICE 
OCCUPATIONS 
While the most successful applications of psychological 
tests have been in the selection of office workers, valuable investi- 
gations have also been conducted in a wide variety of other 
occupations. The fields in which studies of vocational tests 
have been made range from lathe operation to life-insurance 
salesmanship and from type-setting to aviation. Some twenty- 
five to fifty different lines of work, aside from office occupations, 
have been the objects of specific pieces of test research. This 
is in addition to the occupations for which standardized trade 
tests have been constructed, numbering well over one hundred. 
The variety of vocations that have been worked with indicates 
something of the vigor and promise of the test movement. 
In the process of reaching out into many fields of work, 
however, selective tests have failed to develop to their fullest 
in any one field. It is necessary continually to remind ourselves 
that employment tests are very young and that only a few 
scientifically trained psychologists have been active in this 
work. If we consider the comparatively small amount of research 
that has been carried on, and then think of this research spread 
over several dozen occupations, we cease to expect great accom- 
plishments in specific lines. Psychological test studies have, 
on the whole, been exploring possibilities rather than intensively 
developing any one field. Many pioneer investigations have 
been made, but only in a few instances, thus far, have the promis- 
ing trails been followed farther. 
The meaning of all this is simply that vocational tests are 
still in an early experimental stage. Decidedly encouraging 
112

accomplishments are on record, but scarcely any of these can 
be called final and complete. The results have served mainly 
to show attractive possibilities in a large number of vocations 
and to develop a technique for further research. It remains 
for the future to follow up these leads and to apply the test 
methods in building actual test accomplishments that are more 
impressive than those we now have. 
Too conservative an interpretation is not to be placed upon 
the foregoing remarks. A number of test studies have reported 
actual accomplishments of considerable value. These we shall 
describe in the sections that follow. Even in these cases, 
however, results are somewhat tentative since in most instances 
only a single group of workers has been experimented with. 
Only after we have used tests on a number of different groups, 
or on one or two very large groups in an occupation, will we 
be able to say, “Here is a set of standardized tests for this occupa- 
tion,” or even, “Here is a set of standardized tests for this partic- 
ular job in this particular plant.” Nevertheless, positive 
accomplishments in a single restricted experiment are valuable. 
They merely need to be added to. But as far as they go they 
are useful and significant contributions.* 
TRADE TESTS 
In our inquiry into test accomplishments, we need to begin 
by recalling the distinction between trade tests, or proficiency

have appeared during the past two or three years. Among these are the following:

"tests, and aptitude tests. Trade tests attempt to measure the 
individual’s present knowledge and skill in some particular 
line of work; aptitude tests try to determine the individual’s 
potential ability, his capacity for achieving success in a particular 
direction, his possibilities of acquiring the requisite knowledge 
and skill. Trade tests, accordingly, proceed by asking questions 
about the job or by having the individual perform some repre- 
sentative sample piece of work. Aptitude tests must, on the 
other hand, avoid the use of items of knowledge or skill that 
are acquired in the work being tested for; they assume that 
the man tested is unacquainted with the particular occupation. 
Trade tests are evidently very simple. There is nothing 
mysterious about testing a typist by having her type a sample 
letter. Common sense would lead us to ask an applicant for 
a machinist’s job some questions about his trade. But true 
trade tests are not mere haphazard questions or chance jobs 
given the applicant to “try him out.” They are standardized. 
The questions and the sample pieces of work have been experi- 
mentally tested, verified, and refined. They are fixed and 
constant in the things they include, in the way they are adminis- 
tered, and in the way they are graded or scored. Nothing is 
left to the opinion of the person using the tests. Standards 
have been set showing precisely how well men of known ability 
do on the tests. These standardized trade tests are very different 
instruments from the usual trade interviews or trials on the job. 
Standardized trade tests were developed almost exclusively 
in connection with the work of the Committee on Classification 
of Personnel in the United States Army.t Trade tests were

-P-A-G-E-125
  TESTS FOR NON-OFFICE OCCUPATIONS 115 
used in the army to determine whether men were tradesmen in 
the lines in which they claimed skill, and approximately their 
grade of proficiency. Sixty-nine oral tests and twenty-three 
picture tests were constructed for a wide range of the common 
occupations. These tests consisted of carefully sifted and 
standardized sets of questions upon which the candidate could 
be rated. In some few trades, performance tests were used 
(twenty performance trade tests were completed), which required 
the candidate to perform some definitely specified task that was 
typical of his trade, a rating being assigned according to the 
excellence of the completed product and the time required. 
All the tests were tried out on groups of tradesmen in industry 
and were evaluated by comparison with the known ability of 
these men. These tryouts, in general, produced evidence of 
the value of the tests. No adequate studies have been made, 
however, of the actual results obtained through the use of the 
army trade tests. 
Not much has been added to the trade test work of the army. 
There has been considerable talk of the possibilities of trade 
tests in industry, but little actual progress has been reported 
in the use of standardized tests for non-office occupations. Adap- 
tations of the army trade tests were tried experimentally in 
some public employment bureaus,’ but for the practical needs 
of the situation unstandardized “selective trade interviews” 
were later adopted. A trade test in written form that could 
be used with groups was developed and tried out in one post- 
war experiment.? The statistical evidence is favorable and indi- 
cates that trade tests of this kind may be feasible. 
Probably the chief work on trade tests, since the war, is 
some unpublished research of The Scott Company. Attempts 
were made to adapt army trade tests to industrial needs in several 
trades and to build new tests in several other trades. Some

degree of success was achieved, but perhaps the most definite | 
result was the conviction that trade tests can be most success- 
fully developed only through the co-operative efforts of a number 
of companies. It also appeared that for many industrial situa- 
| tions unstandardized or partially standardized trade interviews 
may be more useful than formal tests. Adaptations of trade 
tests to the selection of department-store salespeople, according 
to their knowledge of merchandise, were also developed. These 
met with considerable success. 
All the work that has been done with trade tests, both in 
the army and in industry, has impressed investigators with the 
great possibilities of progress in this direction. Many optimistic 
discussions have appeared which emphasize the desirability 
of extending to industry the army trade test methods. It is 
pointed out that the tests are valuable not only in selection but 
also in training,’ and in the classification of tradesmen by 
employers and even by trade unions. The fact is, however, 
that actual accomplishments are still slight. The difficulties 
in constructing and standardizing trade tests are formidable, 
and in many cases unstandardized methods work sufficiently 
well. Unstandardized trade tests are, of course, widely used 
in industry. They cannot, however, be considered special 
scientific test methods as they use only ordinary common-sense 
procedure. To what extent the optimism will be justified 
regarding standardized trade tests remains at present an open 
question. 
APTITUDE TESTS 
The more important of the studies in tests of vocational 
aptitude in the several occupation fields will be summarized in 
the following pages. We shall divide the investigations into 
three classes: (x) tests for occupations in factory and workshop;   See, for example, A. W. Kornhauser, “A Plan of Apprentice Training,” 
Journal of Personnel Research, I (1922), 215-30.
-P-A-G-E-127
  TESTS FOR NON-OFFICE OCCUPATIONS 117 
(2) tests for salespeople; and (3) tests for a miscellaneous 
group of other occupations. 
TESTS FOR OCCUPATIONS IN FACTORY AND WORKSHOP 
Among the best studies of aptitude tests for factory occupa- 
tions are the researches of H. C. Link in the Winchester Repeating 
Arms Company. He conducted a series of careful, scientific 
test investigations. Special tests were constructed and stand- 
ardized for five different occupational groups in the shop. In 
each instance a thorough study was first made of the requirements 
of the work; then a series of tests was devised and tried out; 
then comparisons were made between test scores and measures 
of working efficiency—production records where these were 
available, and estimates by supervisors in other cases. These 
several test studies may be briefly viewed in turn. 
1. Shell and cartridge inspecting.—Fifty-two girls engaged 
in inspecting brass shells constituted the experimental group 
in the first study. Their work consisted in taking up handfuls 
of shells and carefully inspecting them for dents, scratches, 
stains, and other minute defects. Defective shells had to be 
extracted from the pile and thrown into one of several appropriate 
scrap boxes. 
Sixteen tests were tried out in a preliminary experiment, 
and eight of these were retained for more detailed study with 
the group of fifty-two inspectors. The test scores were compared 
with individual efficiency records showing the average hourly 
output over a period of four weeks. Results showed that three 
of the eight tests were fairly closely related to the ability of the 
inspectors. These successful tests were as follows: (a) a card- 
sorting test, in which the individual had to sort some cards into 
two piles, one pile containing cards with the letter ‘o” on them 
and the other containing the remainder; (6) a cancellation test, . 
in which every “7” had to be crossed out on a page of mixed- 
1H. C. Link, Employment Psychology. New York: The Macmillan Co., 1919.  
-P-A-G-E-128
    118 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
up numbers; (c) a number-group-checking test, which required 
the individual to mark certain sets of numbers on a page. 
These same three tests were tried on sal groups of workers 
in closely allied jobs—twenty-eight cartridge inspectors, ten 
bullet inspectors, and thirty paper shot-shell inspectors. With 
the first two of these groups the tests gave results almost as 
good as they did with the shell inspectors. ace no agreement 
was shown, however, with the efficiency records of the paper shot- 
shell inspectors. This may have been due to the fact that there 
were no individuals whose production records were distinctly 
high or low, and hence there was little possibility for the tests 
to discriminate good and poor workers. 
On the whole, the conclusion based on the experimental work 
with these tests is very favorable. The investigator reports, 
“The results in their entirety were such as to justify the use of 
the three most significant tests together with the eye-sight 
test in the employment office.” 
Further evidence regarding the tests was obtained from their 
actual use. Twenty-nine hundred applicants were tested in 
the employment office. Several small groups from this total 
number are reported on. Some indivicual case reports are 
given to show the superiority of the tests as selective devices 
as contrasted with the personal estimates by foremen. Follow- 
up reports on ninety-four inspectors are compared with their 
test standing and with their length of service. This comparison 
shows the following relation:

  TESTS FOR NON-OFFICE OCCUPATIONS 119 
Another comparison was made for a group of forty-three inspec- 
tors who had been at work two months or more. Their actual 
production records were compared with their test scores on two 
of the tests. (The card-sorting test had not been given.) The 
agreement is not quite as close as in the original experiment, 
but is still far from unsatisfactory. 
2. Shell gauging.—The same tests as those used with shell 
inspectors were tried out with a group of twenty-one girls engaged 
in gauging the head thickness of shells. The two jobs are very 
different in their requirements. The gauging is done in a very 
mechanical fashion which does not even require the use of the 
eyes. The tests, as might be expected, showed wholly dis- 
similar results with the two groups. Only one test proved useful 
in indicating the ability of the gaugers—a “tapping test” in 
which the individual had to press a telegraph key as rapidly as 
possible. The tests which gave good results with inspectors were 
of no value in this new kind of work. In both lines of work 
intelligence tests showed almost no agreement with productive 
efficiency. 
3. Assembling of gun parts.—Tests were devised and tried 
out on several groups—one group of women and three groups 
of men. The work consists of placing the gun parts in position 
and then hammering, screwing, pushing, or springing them 
together. The tests used were two “form-board tests” which 
require the individual tested to place blocks of different sizes 
and shapes into appropriate holes, and a strength of grip test. 
These tests were given to eighteen women applicants, twelve 
of whom were hired. After one or two months these girls were 
ranked in efficiency by their foreman and their section boss, 
and these ratings were then compared with the test scores. 
Estimates were obtained for only ten girls. Within this small 
group the agreement was fairly close between efficiency and test 
scores, but the number of individuals is too small to establish 
the value of the tests.
-P-A-G-E-130
         
  120 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
  The groups of men tested consisted of thirty-one action- 
assemblers, fifty-one finishing-assemblers, and another group 
of twenty-six action-assemblers. The work vas a little higher 
grade than that performed by the women assemblers. Tests 
similar to those given to the women were used. The Stenquist 
assembling test was added, a test which consists of a number of 
unassembled familiar objects to be assembled, such as a mouse 
trap, a bicycle bell, and a simple monkey wrench. As in the case 
of the women, it proved impossible to obtain objective production 
records as a criterion against which to check the tests. Accord- 
ingly each foreman ranked his men in efficiency and these esti- 
mates were compared with the test scores. The results can be 
summarized in the investigator’s own words, “On the whole, 
the results of this experiment were not such as to justify using 
any of the tests tried as a basis for choosing new assemblers. 
Nevertheless, the correlations found justify continued research 
in this field.” This same quotation might well conclude a 
score of other test investigations. | 
4. Dial-machine operating—A specially devised test was 
tried out with several groups of machine operators. The job 
studied involves feeding a machine by placing pieces of metals 
quickly in position on a rotating table. The test which was 
constructed is somewhat similar. It requires the operator 
to drop steel balls through a slot in a rotating disk. The test 
was given to ninety-six dial-machine operators in three different 
shops. Test scores were then compared with production records. 
The agreement is fairly good. The test was considered useful 
enough to be adopted in the employment office. 
5. Tool-making and machine-shop work.—Only a few men 
were tested in this final investigation. First, twelve men with 
from three to five weeks’ training were tested with five tests. 
The test scores were compared with the foreman’s ranking. 
Three tests showed exceptionally good results: a “form board” 
test similar to the ones tried with assemblers, the Stenquist
-P-A-G-E-131
  TESTS FOR NON-OFFICE OCCUPATIONS L27 
test, and a ‘“‘cube-construction test” in which one must assemble 
twenty-seven small cubes into a large cube in such a manner 
that only the painted surfaces of the small cubes show. Two 
other groups consisting of eleven and twelve individuals respec- 
tively were tested with these same tests. The results were not 
as favorable as in the first group, but were still very good. 
Investigations by a number of other industrial psychologists 
have produced results of the same sort as those just described 
for a variety of occupations. A few of the more important 
studies follow: 
6. Apprentice work in a machine-shop.—A study of tests for 
machine-shop apprentices’ has recently been reported which is 
similar to Link’s experiments with apprentices in tool-making 
and machine-shop work. The tests used were about the same 
in this later work as those described under section 5 above. 
Twenty-five apprentices were tested and the test scores were 
compared with estimates of the ability of the men by their 
foremen and instructors. Some agreement was found, though it 
is scarcely close enough to prove that the tests have great value. 
In some measure, however, the results serve to support those 
that Link obtained in his earlier work. 
7. Occupations in a rubber factory.—One series of test studies 
was carried on in the plant of a Canadian rubber company? A 
large number of tests, some thirty-two in all, were tried out in 
connection with several different jobs. Fairly successful sets of 
tests were found for tire-finishers and treaders, for workers who 
supply stock to the operatives, and for a miscellaneous group of 
moderately skilled factory workers. The tests for tire-finishers 
and treaders that were selected on the basis of the tryouts con-

' digits adjacent pairs of numbers whose sum is ten; (b) finding 
consecutive numbers scattered at random over a page; and 
(c) responding as quickly as possible to a signal shown by the 
experimenter. These tests agreed to some extent with the ratings 
of efficiency of the workers. Another set of three tests proved 
about equally diagnostic of ability among the individuals who 
hand out stock. Similar tests were tried for tire-builders, but no 
agreement was found, despite the fact that the work is very 
similar to that of the tire-finishers. A set of five tests of the sort 
usually included in general-intelligence tests proved somewhat 
useful in judging the ability of the miscellaneous group of factory 
workers. 
These experimental results are promising and worthy of 
further investigation. The work that has been described is, 
however, not at all conclusive, since the number of people tested 
is not known and since the statistical methods used are open to 
considerable question. 
8. Lathe operating—Another investigation’ of a wholly 
different character involved the tryout of tests for predicting 
ability in lathe operation. An assortment of tests was given 
to sixty engineering students in a college course in shop practice. 
Scores on the tests were correlated with the ability of the students 
as shown by the accuracy and quality of the work they produced 
in the course. Their products were carefully and objectively 
measured in order to secure a sound rating of efficiency. From 
the seventeen different test scores computed, five were retained as 
the ones of greatest value. The combined score from these five 
tests agreed fairly well with the measures of actual ability. 
Whether this would be true of other groups of lathe operators 
can be ascertained only through further research. The tests 
which proved useful are: (a) and (5) a specially devised 
co-ordination test, which represents in miniature certain elements

of lathe operation; (c) a test in which the six parts of a lock 
must be assembled; (d) a test in which a “puzzle box” must 
be opened by manipulating levers according to directions; and 
(e) a test in which the individual must quickly mark the centers 
of a number of circles of different sizes. 
9. Printing: hand-composing.—An exceptionally well con- 
ducted investigation was made in the printing industry by a 
British psychologist. The principal work was done with the job 
of hand-composing. The hand-composer or compositor assembles 
the lines of type to be used in printing. He must pick the letters 
from the appropriate compartments on a wooden tray which 
holds all the letters and other signs used in printing. The type 
must be quickly and correctly placed, the lines must be kept 
even, the pages of type must be properly locked with space for 
margins, and so on. The qualities required for the work are 
found to be: (a) good eyesight, (b) physical strength above 
average, (c) dexterity of right hand and arm, (d) rapid visual 
observation, (e) good “immediate memory” or ability to hold 
material in mind for a short interval, (f) ability to estimate size 
and form, (g) moderate degree of general intelligence. 
Six tests were tried out on groups of compositors. in four 
printing works. The groups contained twenty-five, twenty-four, 
forty, and eleven individuals, respectively. In each instance 
the workers were ranked according to their test scores and also 
according to their efficiency as rated by the managers. These 
rankings were then compared in order to see how well the tests 
succeeded in picking out the good and the poor compositors. 
Three of the tests gave very good results. These were: (a) a 
“match-stick insertion test” which requires that match sticks 
be inserted in small holes in a board; (5) a “cancellation test” 
in which every e¢ on a page has to be crossed off; (3) a “directions 
test” where the individual must carry out precisely certain

specific instructions. Combined scores on these three tests 
agreed closely with ratings of the ability of the compositors. 
Some evidence appeared that a fourth test has value—an immedi- 
ate memory test in which the individual must remember and 
write down sentences he has just read. 
10. Other occupations in the printing industry.—Two earlier 
studies in the selection of workers for the printing industry had 
been published in Germany.t These were war-time investiga- 
tions aiming to aid in the selection of women applicants to 
replace men. The first investigator used a series of five tests, 
and, on the basis of a tryout among sixty applicants, the tests 
were recommended for use and standards were set. Definite 
evidence in support of the tests was not published. The second 
investigator used substantially the same tests in the regular 
examination of applicants in a large printing industry. Follow- 
up reports indicated that there was considerable agreement 
between the test scores and the ability of the employees as rated 
by their supervisors. 
11. Occupations in a feather factory.—In another investiga- 
tion,? seventy-five women employees in a feather and fancy- 
ornament factory were tested. Some nineteen different tests 
were used, most of them well-known standardized tests of 
general intelligence and quickness of association. Seven specially 
devised tests were tried out. These consisted of several tasks 
analogous to the actual operations and of other tests which gave 
promise of tapping the abilities involved. The seventy-five 
workers tested were ranked in order according to their scores 
on each test, and these rankings were compared with an “effi-

ciency roster” compiled from ratings made independently by 
four members of the management. Remarkably high indexes 
of agreement are obtained (though the statistical methods are 
not clear) but these are of doubtful importance, due to the 
fact that the people tested composed a most heterogeneous 
group, ranging from skilled operatives in the “fancy department” 
to errand girls and routine feather-sorters. In actual practice 
the employment problem is rarely to select better and poorer 
workers from a group so varied. 
A separate study was made of twenty girls in the selecting 
department, all engaged in sorting feathers according to size 
and color. Three tests were found to work successfully with 
this group: a test in estimating the size of pieces of cardboard, 
a color discrimination test, and a test in sorting feathers (really 
a sample of the job itself). There is some question whether 
these are aptitude tests or whether they measure abilities that 
were in part acquired on the job. 
Three years after the original investigation, inquiry was 
made concerning the progress of the employees who had been 
tested. The investigator states that, “the findings of the tests 
are vindicated by a fairly close parallel between what the tests 
predicted and what actually developed in the operation of the 
factory.” The evidence, however, is not unambiguous. 
12. Operations in a camera factory.—Some test work at the 
Eastman Kodak Company’ has been reported, but the results 
are not given in a manner that makes possible any judgment 
as to their value. Some 3,000 women workers have been tested, 
with apparently very satisfactory results. Mechanical tests were 
used, consisting of boards with holes in them into which small 
metal pins were to be inserted. Experimental tryout of the tests 
is said to have demonstrated their usefulness in picking out 
good and poor operators.

13. Factory work in a silk mill.—Several other investigators 
have tested factory workers with general intelligence tests. The 
results are not in agreement. In one study* an intelligence 
test was used with four hundred workers in a silk mill. No 
agreement at all was shown between the tests and production 
records. 
14. Factory work in a clothing establishment.—An investiga- 
tion? in a large clothing factory, however, obtained very favor- 
able results from the use of a general intelligence test. Test 
scores of 290 employees were compared with accurate produc- 
tion records extending over a four-week period, and fair agree- 
ment was found. This study is especially valuable and is almost 
unique in one particular. The investigator scientifically compared 
the results gotten by means of tests with the results obtained by other 
available methods in the actual employment situation. This pro- 
cedure seems the obvious thing to do, but scarcely any studies 
have done it. In the investigation just referred to it was found 
that there was no agreement between the size-up of applicants 
by two experienced interviewers and the later efficiency of these 
applicants. The tests, then, were considered valuable not 
because they were nearly perfect but because they were better 
than any reasonable alternative. 
15. Ball-bearing inspecting—One other study should be 
mentioned by reason of the great popularity it has enjoyed. It 
was an early piece of work conducted by Thompson, a scientific 
management engineer, and reported some years later by F. W. 
Taylors A simple test was used in selecting girls engaged in 
inspecting ball bearings. It appears that the test consisted 
in timing certain elements of the work; that is, it was probably

not a standardized test at all. It is stated that thirty-five of 
the selected workers accomplished the work that 120 girls had 
previously performed. The nature of the test and the results is 
very vague and the study probably is of little significance. Other 
changes were introduced simultaneously with the new selection 
methods, thus making it impossible to say definitely what part 
of the gain was due to the test." 
TESTS FOR FACTORY OCCUPATIONS—SUMMARY 
A consideration of the foregoing studies leads to an apprecia- 
tion of the possibilities of tests for special manual jobs, and at the 
same time it emphasizes the relatively slight achievements 
that have been made. In other words, the status of psychological 
tests for factory workers can be summed up in the phrase, “a 
good beginning.” Tests of value have been found for a few 
specific occupations, but even in these cases, with two or three 
exceptions, the results have not been conclusive. Typically, 
the results have not been obtained consistently enough or 
obtained from large enough numbers to warrant any definite 
judgment that the tests are valuable. But, in almost all 
instances, the results have been encouraging and have seemed 
to justify further research. 
In the field of special aptitude tests for workshop and factory 
jobs, Link’s work, especially with shell inspectors, and Muscio’s 
study of hand-compositors may be pointed to as representative 
of the best that has been accomplished. These investigations 
have produced results which appear to be well established. A 
few other pieces of research have also obtained favorable results 
though of more doubtful validity. 
The value of general intelligence tests for factory occupations 
is not clear. A number of writers have emphasized the impor- 
tance of eliminating the feeble-minded and very dull applicants

* by means of intelligence tests, as well as the possibility of select- 
ing for promotion individuals of special alertness. Actual 
investigations demonstrating these uses of tests are lacking. 
Of the few studies that have been reported, some (Burtt, Burr, 
Wembridge) have found intelligence test scores of value, while 
others (Link, Otis, several unpublished studies) have obtained 
opposite results. These differences may well be due to the fact 
that the groups tested and the nature of the work were very 
different in the several cases. It appears reasonable to suppose 
that in certain situations intelligence tests for factory workers 
are decidedly worth while. 
As to trade tests, the possible usefulness is especially clear. 
But the actual accomplishments of standardized trade tests 
are almost nil, save, of course, in the army work. The reason 
for this lies chiefly in the fact that the standardization of tests 
is difficult and expensive, and unstandardized trade interviews 
and sample jobs work well enough. A few of the special ability 
tests that have appeared successful for factory occupations bor- 
der on being trade tests (for example, some of the tests used 
by Burr and by Patten). No one seems to doubt that trade 
tests are practicable and of value. Whether or not there is 
sufficient need to justify standardizing the tests in a given situa- 
tion is the question. So far the question has been answered 
almost everywhere in the negative. 
TESTS FOR SALESPEOPLE 
A few studies have been reported on the selection of salesmen 
by means of tests. We shall briefly summarize these results 
and then see what conclusions can be drawn. 
1. As far back as 1915, Scott’ published a little material 
on the selection of salesmen by tests. He reports the use of 
an intelligence test with ten traveling salesmen of a large tobacco 
*W. D. Scott, “The Scientific Selection of Salesmen,” Advertising and Selling 
(October-December, 1915). These articles are reprinted in Bloomfield’s Employ- 
ment Management, pp. 222-37.

company. The early sales records of these men showed no 
agreement with their test scores, but some months later the 
salesmen who remained (only five men) stood in the same order 
in their selling records as they had in the tests. Scott and his 
associates later tested a number of other groups of salesmen, 
but the results have not been published. In many of the studies 
little relation was found between test scores and sales records. 
2. Miinsterberg™ also did a little experimenting with tests 
for salespeople. In one instance he compared the test scores 
of five of the best salesmen and five of the poorest salesmen of 
a large manufacturing concern. Two tests were found to differen- 
tiate especially well. Both of the tests involved selecting or 
rearranging letters to make them spell words or names. Similar 
tests were given to ten good and ten poor salesmen in a clothing 
establishment. No agreement was found between test scores 
and sales ability in this group. In another study tests were 
used with department-store salespeople—thirty-five efficient 
sales clerks and thirty-five inefficient ones. Several tests gave 
favorable results, especially the test involving the rearrangement 
of letters to form words (probably a test of intelligence). 
3. In another investigation? of department-store salespeople 
there are reported the results of a large number of tests (principally 
intelligence tests) given to groups of especially competent and 
especially incompetent sales clerks. About fifty individuals 
were tested in the main study. Tests were found which differ- 
entiated very well between selected groups of salespeople. The 
tests are shown also to afford a basis for distinguishing between 
capable salespeople and office clerical workers, again using the 
selected groups. It is not known how successfully the tests

could be used to indicate differences in hie in the ordinary 
run of sales clerks or applicants for sales positions. 
It is a point of considerable interest that in almost all the 
tests the good salespeople made lower scores than the poor 
salespeople. That is, the agreement between test scores and 
sales ability was in the reverse direction from what might have 
been expected. This is especially remarkable since other studies, 
including an earlier investigation by this same writer,’ found the 
opposite relation. 
4. Another series of test studies? reports the use of 
intelligence tests with several groups of shoe salesmen. One 
group of retail shoe salesmen was given an intelligence test, 
and the scores were compared with the manager’s classification 
of the salesmen into a “good” and a “mediocre” group. On 
the average the good salesmen made decidedly higher scores 
than the poor salesmen. In another study, thirty-seven retail 
shoe salesmen and saleswomen were tested with an intelligence 
test. Again marked differences in average score appeared 
between the “above average” group, the “average” group, and 
the “below average” group. Similar results were obtained with 
another group of twenty-nine shoe sales people, but in this in- 
stance both an intelligence test and an “occupational shoe test” 
were used. In all these comparisons the groups overlap to a 
considerable extent, even though the averages are rather far apart. 
5. A final study? to be reported differs from the others in 
that the tests used were not intelligence tests. A set of tests 
attempting to get at character traits such as persistence and 
flexibility was given to two groups of life-insurance salesmen. 
The salesmen were classified as to selling ability on the basis

of the insurance each sold over a period of eleven weeks, in the 
same territory and at the same time. The groups contained 
forty-seven and seventy-five men, respectively. Marked differ- 
ences were obtained in the average scores of the “successful,” 
“doubtful,” and “unsuccessful” salesmen. There was, of course, 
considerable overlapping of the groups despite the clear differ- 
ences between them on the average. 
The investigator concludes that “the tests are of positive 
value in predicting success in selling life insurance.” He states 
also that “results from these tests are much more significant 
for sales work than intelligence test results.” 
TESTS FOR SALESPEOPLE—-SUMMARY 
Only a very small dent has been made in the problem of 
selecting salesmen by means of tests. Intelligence tests have 
been used in almost all investigations despite the common recogni- 
tion that selling ability is far different from abstract intelligence. 
Some studies have, however, reported favorable results from the 
use of intelligence tests. This is not surprising. The individuals 
tested had already been selected with some regard to their posses- 
sion of tact and ability to meet people, and it is to be expected 
that, these other qualities being equal, the more intelligent man 
will be the better salesman. In so far, then, as intelligence 
tests are used as supplements to other methods of choosing 
salesmen, they may prove useful. Their usefulness must be 
determined, however, in each specific situation where they are 
to be used. 
The last study we reported opens up a promising field for 
research with tests of character qualities and non-intellectual 
traits. Later work, following upon that presented, has not 
entirely agreed with these published results. Many psychologists 
are of the opinion, however, that tests of selling ability will be 
developed along these special lines rather than through the use 
of the better-known tests. The use of interest questionnaires

and items concerning the personal history and social life of 
individuals may prove even more valuable than any tests. The 
tests, however, are likely to supply useful supplementary informa- 
tion. Accomplishments at least justify that prediction. 
TESTS FOR SOME MISCELLANEOUS OCCUPATIONS 
Tests have been tried for a number of occupations other than 
those we have discussed. The more important of these studies 
we shall summarize even more briefly than the foregoing ones. 
1. Two or three test investigations have been made in teleg- 
raphy. One experimenter’ gave a series of tests to twenty-two 
boys studying telegraphy in a continuation school. A selected 
list of six tests was found, the scores on which agreed closely 
with the ranking of the boys in ability by their instructor. 
Another investigator? tried out eight tests on a group of 
165 men taking a war-time course in radio-telegraphy. Test 
scores were compared with records of the speed with which indi- 
viduals could receive messages. Fair agreement was found, 
especially for an original ‘‘rhythm test.” 
A German investigator? used a test which was a sample 
or miniature of actual telegraphic work. No results are published 
to show the success of the test. 
2. Several studies have also been made of telephone-operating. 
One of Miinsterberg’s‘ early sets of tests was for this occupation. 
He used a series of eight tests with a group of about thirty opera- 
tors in training. No statistical results are published, but the 
tests are stated to have been satisfactory.

Another investigator’ tested nine operators with two tests, 
in one of which the individual tested had to operate a miniature 
switchboard. The tests proved fairly effective in picking out 
the good and the poor operators in this small group. 
The most important work with telephone operators is some 
research done in Geneva.?_ A series of tests was given to twenty- 
seven operators and test scores were compared with the man- 
ager’s ranking of the girls. A set of eight tests was found 
which gave results in close agreement with the efficiency 
ratings. 
3. Tests for street-car motormen have been tried out in three 
or four investigations. Another of Miinsterberg’s’ early studies 
was in this field. He used an ingenious test which it was hoped 
would represent the same sort of psychological situation as is 
present in the actual running of a street car. The test was given 
to a number of motormen—good, medium, and bad ones. The 
results are said to have shown “‘a far-reaching correspondence” 
between test performance and actual efficiency. Statistics 
are not given. 
A later investigation* in Germany made use of a more or 
less similar test with six women applicants for positions as 
“motormen.” Only three applicants remained at the work. 
This number is too small to warrant any conclusion concerning 
the test. 
Another German investigator’ tested twenty motormen with 
a test involving elaborate apparatus—calculated to simulate

the complex task of running a car along a busy street. The 
results indicate that the test is of value though the agreement 
of test scores and ability as motormen is far from perfect. 
Another brief report' states that some psychological tests 
have been used for selecting motormen in Dallas. The tests 
are said to have shown good agreement with the men’s records. 
4. There are also some reports of intelligence tests applied to 
policemen. One investigator? tested thirty candidates for posi- 
tions as policemen and firemen. No direct evidence is given 
of the value of the tests. 
In another study? several hundred policemen in Detroit 
were tested with the army intelligence test and one or two other 
tests. The investigator concludes that he is “not able to find 
anything strikingly diagnostic in any of the tests.” This 
conclusion was based on a comparison of test scores with the 
detailed service records of the policemen. Police officers made 
lower test scores than the patrolmen. Moreover, the men with 
longer periods of service scored lower than those who had served 
a shorter time. The interpretation is probably that “the 
brightest men who enter the police service drop out from that 
occupation in favor of other occupations where their ability 
is better recognized.” It is pointed out that the same tendency 
is present in some other occupations and in the police force of 
another city.

unstandardized civil-service tests for policemen in Philadelphia. The men who 
received high test ratings almost all made good records in the Police Training 
School; those with low test ratings proved to include the good and the poor in 
about equal numbers. (L. L. Thurstone, “The Civil Service Tests for Patrolmen 
in Philadelphia,” Public Personnel Studies, I [1924], 1-5).

5. An intelligence test study’ has been reported in which 
the scores of a group of restaurant waitresses were compared 
with the length of service of the individuals. The waitresses 
who had served four months or less made decidedly better 
scores on the average than did those with longer periods of service. 
This is the same sort of relation as that reported of policemen 
in the preceding study. 
6. A set of ingenious tests for journalistic aptitude has been 
described by one investigator? He presents the results obtained 
with several groups of students of journalism and a few reporters. 
The group comparisons and the correlations of scores with 
instructors’ ratings indicate that the test is effective. : 
7. An attempt has been made by a British investigator’ to 
find tests for dressmaking aptitude. Tests of speed and accuracy 
in a variety of simple movements were tried, and also some tests 
for observation, ability to follow directions, judgment of dis- 
tances, memory of form and color, and so on. The tests were 
given to dressmaking classes in London trade schools, and the 
results were compared with estimates of the girls’ abilities by 
their teachers and by their companions, Scores from the com- 
bined tests agreed well with the ranking of the girls in actual 
ability, but some doubt concerning the tests is justified by the 
fact that a second set of test scores showed very poor agreement 
with the results earlier obtained for the same group of people. 
8. During the world-war there was a great deal of psycho- 
logical study of military occupations, especially of aviation. 
These investigations can merely be touched upon here. 
Far more effort has gone into the study of aviation from the 
point of view of vocational selection than into any other single

occupation, military or civil Elaborate physical examinations 
and painstaking interviewing methods had been used in selecting 
aviation candidates from the beginning, but the predictions of 
future success had proved suificiently unreliable to warrant 
intensive rescarch on the problem by psychologists as well as 
by physiologists and medical men. A certain measure of success 
was attained. General intelligence tests and personal informa- 
tion concerning the candidate were shown to be useful, and a 
number of psychophysical tests were evolved to supplement 
these and to get at the candidate’s probable ability to fly and 
to endure such special conditions as partial asphyxiation. One 
of the later reports of research? concludes that: “The tests, as 
a whole, and some of them singly, are to some extent diagnostic. 
Their precise value, however, can be known only after trial 
under more favorable conditions.” 
Careful experimental studies were made of other military 
and naval tasks, one or two examples of which may briefly be 
noted. One investigator’ developed valuable methods for

selecting gun-pointers in the United States Navy by means of 
specially constructed apparatus. Tests were also devised for 
selecting recruits for plotting-room service and for the school for 
listeners in the navy. Work along somewhat similar lines was 
conducted in the British navy for selecting candidates for training 
in hydrophone listening.” Other investigators? report some 
research on tests for men in the look-out and signal service in 
the navy.

the border-line between business uses of tests and educational 
uses. Most prominent of these are Seashore’s investigations in 
methods of determining musical ability. He has developed an 
elaborate array of tests aiming to measure the constituent 
special abilities involved in music. Evidence showing just 
how valuable these tests are has not been published. 
Tests have been used to determine the ability of professional 
engineering students* with considerable success. Tests were 
also used in connection with other devices in an investigation’ 
to determine the differential fitness of engineers for work as 
salesmen, designers, and executives.

  Some German investigators’ have also experimented with 
the use of tests among students in vocational schools, but no 
tesults are given to prove the value of the analyses made or of 
the tests used. 
A number of other test studies along similar lines have been 
made, but they would take us too far from the main line of our 
discussion. We shall leave the reports of particular investi- 
gations and proceed to an attempt to draw some conclusions 
from all the material presented. 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS FOR 
BUSINESS—SOME CONCLUSIONS 
We should be able now to reach a general statement as to 
the accomplishments of psychological tests for the different 
occupational groups. While any generalization must be pre- 
sented with some misgivings, we shall venture to summarize 
in a few short paragraphs the material we have been reviewing. 
With our conclusions we shall combine some warnings. 
Above everything else is to be emphasized the necessity 
for reaching a judgment concerning tests which recognizes both 
their possibilities and their shortcomings. It is easy to condemn 
or approve; it is difficult to suspend judgment. We are prone 
to say of new methods, such as tests, that they are good or that 
they are bad. Usually they are neither. We must avoid 
extreme and unqualified approval of tests just as we must 
avoid ungrounded criticism and disapproval. Psychological tests 
for business occupations have done something; but they have 
done far from everything. 
In this connection a second point is to be kept clearly in 
mind. Psychological tests must be judged in terms of the prac- 
tical problem to be solved and the actual alternatives available

rather than by comparison with a standard of perfection. Even 
the best of tests are a long way from the 1oo-per cent mark in 
their results. Can more be said for any other method of selecting 
men? ‘The proper question is never, Do tests enable me to 
judge men for jobs with unerring accuracy? Of course they do 
not. The real practical question is simply, Do tests aid me in 
arriving at appreciably better judgments than I can reach without 
them? The answer to this question is frequently a definite 
affirmative. Not, perhaps, that the tests are so good; rather 
that the ordinary methods are so poor. 
Definite comparisons of the results gotten by test methods 
with those obtained from non-test methods are rare. Research 
of this kind is especially needed. Only by knowing how well 
present methods of selection operate can we form sound judg- 
ments as to the usefulness of tests as a new method. In the 
absence of direct comparisons of this sort, the best we can do is 
to point to the serious mistakes and inaccuracies of the usual 
selection process and then to infer that wherever tests show even 
fairly good results they are a valuable addition to employment 
methods. 
In the case of office occupations, the chief accomplishments 
have been: (x) the development of successful tests for clerical 
workers, especially general intelligence tests and tests of achieve- 
ment in spelling, arithmetic, etc.; (2) the development of 
successful proficiency tests (trade tests) for typists and stenogra- 
phers; (3) promising pioneer work on aptitude tests for typing 
and stenography and for computing machine operating; and 
(4) collection of evidence as to the value of intelligence tests 
for indicating the alertness and future possibilities of various 
classes of office workers. 
Psychological tests for factory occupations have made less 
progress. Some good beginnings have been made, however, 
prominent among which are the following: (1) the army con- 
struction of trade tests for a large number of occupations;
-P-A-G-E-150
  140 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
(2) the tentative conclusion that intelligence tests are useful for 
selecting within some groups of factory workers but are worthless 
with other groups; (3) the development of a few successful 
aptitude tests for particular occupations (for example, Link’s 
work and Muscio’s); and (4) promising attempts at the construc- 
tion of aptitude tests for a number of other occupations. 
Little in the way of positive progress has been reported in the 
test selection of salespeople. The research that has been done 
shows that (1) intelligence tests sometimes are useful and some- 
times are not, and (2) results of possible value may be obtained 
through further investigation with tests of non-intellectual 
characteristics and interest questionnaires. Intelligence tests 
are probably valuable wherever other qualities—social and 
temperamental—can be assumed to be satisfactory. Other things 
being equal, greater intelligence is an asset for salesmanship. 
In several other occupations test research has made consider- 
able progress. Thus: (1) good pioneer work has been reported 
in special aptitude tests for telegraphers, telephone operators, 
street-car motormen, journalists, aviators and other military 
occupations, musicians, and others; (2) intelligence tests have 
been used with some measure of success among policemen, 
waitresses, professional-engineering students, and a number of 
other groups more or less definitely vocational; and (3) army 
trade tests have been constructed for a variety of occupations. 
Our survey of test accomplishments would be incomplete 
without mention once more of the method and technique that 
have been developed. All the specific test achievements are sec- 
ondary to the scientific procedure for test construction and for 
testing the tests, which have grown out of the efforts of applied 
psychologists in this field.

CHAPTER V 
THE PLACE OF TESTS IN THE PERSONNEL 
PROGRAM 
In this and the final chapter we shall consider several aspects 
of psychological tests in business which have been mentioned 
in the preceding pages, but which have not been developed. In 
particular, the following matters deserve further discussion: 
(x) problems of test administration and the place of tests in 
the actual employment procedure; (2) uses of tests for other 
purposes than hiring employees; and (3) the future of tests in 
business, and the conditions necessary for progress in industrial 
test work. 
Up to this point the major emphasis has been placed on test 
research. We have described the methods and the chief accom- 
plishments in the research development of employment tests, 
But there are many problems on the administrative side of test 
work in business, as well as on the side of research. We shall 
suggest some of the technical problems that arise in the routine 
use of tests, and shall also indicate how tests can be fitted into 
the actual administrative procedure of the employment 
department. 
Emphasis has been placed also, up to this point, on the use of 
tests for hiring and placement. It has been suggested in passing 
that this is not their only possible use, but it is the use to which 
they have principally been put. In addition, however, tests are 
useful aids in making readjustments in the working force, and 
in connection with training programs, personnel surveys, investi- 
gations into the causes of labor turnover, vocational guidance 
procedures, and so on. [Illustrations of these applications of 
tests will be given in this chapter. 
141
-P-A-G-E-152
  142 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
Finally, in the concluding chapter, we shall point out certain 
of the broader relationships of the testing movement, particularly 
with reference to the outlook for the future development of 
vocational testing. 
TEST RESEARCH AND TEST ADMINISTRATION 
Problems connected with the use of psychological tests in 
business fall into two distinct classes—those of test research 
and those of test administration. Most of what has been said in 
this book deals with test research. This is true partly because 
tests are still so young and so definitely in the experimental 
stage. In part, too, it is a recognition of the fact that the prob- 
lems of test administration are relatively much simpler and less 
technical than those of research. 
Test research includes such things as studying the particular 
requirements of the various occupations for which tests are 
desired, searching out or constructing tests which seem promis- 
ing, standardizing the technique of these, trying them out on 
workers of known efficiency, ascertaining the relative value of 
each test and combination of tests, deciding on those that are 
to be used, determining critical scores or other standards to be 
used in applying them to individuals, and, in general, settling 
the first and the basic problem—that of preparing a selective 
instrument of tried and proved value. Then, and only then, 
does the problem become one of test administration. 
Perhaps the time will come when occupational descriptions 
will be so well standardized, conditions of work so uniformly 
regulated and understood, and tests standardized for such a 
variety of tasks, that employment officers can refer to an index 
and determine at once what test methods have been found to 
be appropriate for each kind of work. But that time is far in 
the future. Indeed, so long as occupations and industries 
multiply, new or improved machines and methods are intro- 
duced, and work continues to become more and more specialized,   
     
-P-A-G-E-153
TESTS IN THE PERSONNEL PROGRAM 143 
there is no hope for a ready-made standardization of selection 
methods for every kind of occupation. Hence, test research 
may be expected to continue to be an important and a growing 
phase of scientifically managed industry, and in practice insepar- 
able from test administration. There is to be expected a 
constantly growing demand for competent, trained research 
investigators, even after testing has reached the point where the 
actual giving of tests to applicants for employment can be turned 
over to routine workers. 
But even when testing has reached the administrative stage, 
we should not make the mistake of thinking of tests as being 
standardized once for all. Research on test results is likely to 
be even more valuable after the tests have been used in inducting 
hundreds of workers into a business, and after their success in 
selecting the suitable workers has been demonstrated, than was 
the research done in originally introducing the test program. 
PROBLEMS OF TEST ADMINISTRATION 
Test administration is at least on the surface a relatively 
simple task. Once a procedure has been worked out, adequate 
for the different jobs and occupations represented in the establish- 
ment, the giving and scoring of tests and the recording of test 
results of applicants for employment is not especially compli- 
cated. Nevertheless, test administration offers problems which 
by no means solve themselves. 
1. Provision must be made for suitable quarters and appara- 
tus, and for getting and maintaining those physical and mental 
conditions which enable the applicant to do himself justice. One 
example of precaution in this direction is the practice of starting 
each test with a “shock-absorber”—some easy and amusing 
problem, such as a picture puzzle—to instil self-confidence in 
the applicant and awaken his interest. 
2. A routine procedure must be established and a daily sched- 
ule has to be prepared in order that tests can be given in the most 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
    144 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
economical and effective way, and in order that wherever possible 
tests shall be given to groups of applicants simultaneously, to 
minimize expenditure of time and effort. 
3. A thousand and one details of technique of test-giving and 
scoring, connected with timing, arrangement of materials, verbal 
instructions, encouragement or explanation properly to be given 
or withheld, economical methods of scoring large numbers of 
tests, have to be mastered and kept unchanged, to avoid the 
many possibilities of error which only training enables one to 
foresee. 
4. Where different occupations in an industry require a 
variety of groupings and weightings of the many tests used, the 
formulas which have been worked out to achieve this end have 
to be applied and adequate records made. 
5. The making and keeping of records of test results and of 
other facts that are considered in employee selection, in such form 
that they shall be readily accessible and easily interpretable, is 
an important and often a difficult problem. Unless records are 
of such form and nature as to facilitate future reference, either 
for checking up individual success or for statistical tabulation 
and analysis, half their value is lost. 
6. Test scores of individual applicants have to be interpreted 
in their relation to other personal data entered on the application 
blank or revealed in the interview or references, appropriate 
decisions made, and action taken. 
7. Test materials and supplies have to be kept in order and 
prevented from getting into unauthorized hands. It seems 
inevitable that much more attention shall be given to this detail 
as tests become more widely used and prospective applicants 
learn to prepare in advance for the tests. Every teacher makes 
it a point to keep secret his prospective examination questions, 
sometimes at the cost of elaborate care. The same is conspicu- 
ously true of state examinations for admission to practice law 
or medicine. But practically no concerted effort has been made
-P-A-G-E-155
TESTS IN THE PERSONNEL PROGRAM 145 
or even suggested among psychologists or test-publishers to 
keep psychological tests from falling into unauthorized hands. 
Already complaints are heard that the value of the army Alpha 
test has been lessened by too much publicity. 
8. Many problems of test administration arise in individual 
cases, where there is a question of what tests to use, or of the 
interpretation of the scores. Even in cases where the employ- 
ment machinery is in smooth running order, the routine of 
testing applicants and ‘‘passing”’ or “failing” them is not wholly 
mechanical. The procedure varies from case to case with cir- 
cumstances. Sometimes the candidate applies for a specific 
job. More commonly he applies for ‘‘some” job, with certain 
very general restrictions, such as that it shall be office work or 
machine work. In the former case, he may be a skilled worker 
claiming certain proficiencies. Here proficiency tests, such as 
trade tests, enable the employer to determine whether he actually 
possesses the requisite degree of knowledge and skill. But if he 
is an unskilled worker, or applies for work of a type which has 
to be learned on the job, aptitude tests of various sorts permit 
the employer to determine whether or not he has the traits, 
physical, motor, sensory, intellectual, or temperamental, which 
previous investigation has shown to be necessary to insure 
success in that particular work. In times of labor shortage the 
procedure will be to eliminate only those definitely below the 
minimum critical score, the predetermined lowest level for prob- 
able success. If, on the other hand, the supply of applicants 
exceeds the need, the one or more rating highest will be selected 
for immediate employment and the others perhaps asked to 
leave their applications on file for possible future use. 
In view of all these problems, it is not to be expected that 
even the routine work of testing applicants for employment can 
safely be done without at least the supervision of trained special- 
ists. Most tests require at least a little special training and 
experience on the tester’s part before he can administer them  
-P-A-G-E-156
  
146 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
easily and without liability to error. When an employment 
program involves a great variety of tests, this requirement is 
magnified in importance. One present tendency evident among 
test-makers is to make administration simpler and easier, as, 
for example, in the “self-administering”’ tests of Otis and Thur- 
stone. But even at its simplest, test administration is not some- 
thing which just any clerk can pick up and carry on without 
special instruction and supervision. When to the work of test 
administration we add the inseparable problems of test inter- 
pretation, test selection, and test standardization, it is evident 
that we have not only a new tool but a new technology—or 
profession. 
TESTS AND THE GENERAL EMPLOYMENT PROCEDURE 
It would be a great mistake to think of the administration of 
tests, or even of test research, as a particular kind of personnel 
work which stands apart from the other activities that confront 
the worker in this broad field. Neither in their technique, nor 
in their relations to the general employment function, are psy- 
chological tests wholly unique. Still less are they to be thought 
of as constituting the substance of the work of employment 
management. 
A course in psychological testing in a university—or a succes- 
sion of courses—will not alone equip a man or woman to become 
a competent employment specialist. While it is evident, from 
what has been said, that adequate preparation for genuinely 
scientific personnel research necessitates rigorous, systematic 
training in research methods, this kind of training is the ideal 
rather than the prevailing practice. Many more employment 
officers have come to their present position by way of some other. 
department or position in the organization they serve than have 
come by way of specialized, technical training courses for employ- 
ment work. While such actual business experience alone is not 
an ideal preparation for scientific personnel work, it does at any
-P-A-G-E-157
  
TESTS IN THE PERSONNEL PROGRAM 147 
rate furnish an indispensable element in such preparation—a 
first-hand knowledge of business in general and of that business 
in particular. And it does give one a perspective of the place 
of tests in the employment program that the university classroom 
or laboratory does not give. 
One of the things the employment manager soon learns is 
that the use of tests or other scientific devices in selecting workers 
is only one phase—and perhaps in practice a very minor phase— 
of his everyday work. He learns that he must have constant 
recourse to a great many other methods—some good, some 
poor—for helping to form judgments on the fitness of applicants 
and placing them wisely. He learns that his ideal programs are 
being constantly shattered by conditions of the labor market and 
by demands from other departments of his organization. He 
finds that a thousand and one details that fall—or are dumped 
by other departments—within his jurisdiction keep him from 
cultivating the leisurely, detached, scientific attitude which one 
associates with the term “research.” These problems have to 
be faced and worked into his daily program. If he can use tests 
and test technique to effect a more satisfactory solution for any 
of them, so much the better. But he quickly learns to value 
the tests only as means to his ends, and not as ends in themselves. 
STEPS IN THE EMPLOYMENT PROCESS 
In a large establishment where the employment functions 
have been centralized in a single department, the steps in the 
procedure of hiring and placing employees are fairly definite and 
uniform. Assuming that jobs have been analyzed and job 
specifications (or some other form of occupational descriptions) 
have been made available for the use of the employment office, 
let us outline the steps in the employment sequence in order to 
see just where and how tests fit into the process. 
1. Contacts are first made with potential sources of labor 
supply. One important source is the present working force.
-P-A-G-E-158
  
148 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
When a vacancy is to be filled, the first thought of the employ- 
ment manager should be, Is this an opportunity to promote or 
transfer some deserving present employee? Ordinarily psy- 
chological tests are less important in selecting from within the 
business than from without, but they have real possibilities of 
giving supplementary information about even well-known 
workers. The outside sources of labor supply are numerous and 
varied. Applicants may be secured by means of advertising; 
labor scouts; personal introduction by employees, customers, 
or stockholders; the influence of the firm’s presence and reputa- 
tion in the community; and contacts with outside organizations 
such as firms, fraternal and social bodies, churches, public and 
private schools, business schools, high schools and colleges. 
All these may afford a possible, though ordinarily a very hetero- 
geneous, source of supply. Little preliminary weeding-out of 
undesirable material is possible, except at the point where, as 
sometimes happens, co-operative relations are established with 
certain schools which have facilities for selecting from among 
their students those whom they recommend. 
2. Preliminary classification of applicants may be made at 
the door of the plant into such groups as office workers, sales- 
men, unskilled labor, and skilled tradesmen, in order to refer 
them, for greater convenience, to different clerks, desks, or rooms 
in the employment office. 
3. Applications are received. Usually at this point the 
applicant fills out an application blank. While application 
blanks vary widely from one establishment to another and one 
kind of business to another, they ordinarily seek to elicit such 
information as seems likely to be of importance, either in inter- 
viewing, hiring, and placing the worker, or in maintaining future 
telations with him. Personal and family history, facts about 
race, personal habits, religion, education, health, work prefer- 
ences, experience, interests, reasons for applying, and almost 
anything else may be asked about. Probably the majority of
-P-A-G-E-159
TESTS IN THE PERSONNEL PROGRAM 149 
application blanks ask questions which have no value whatever 
for ascertaining the applicant’s fitness; and probably as many 
fail to call for certain information which might prove very sig- 
nificant. There is almost as great a need for a thoroughgoing, 
scientific investigation of the values of each of the different kinds 
of personal data as there is for investigating the value of various 
selective tests. 
4. Inquiries are made from references named by the candi- 
date. These are either former employers or others who can speak 
of his character, training, and ability. Employers place no 
reliance on general letters of recommendation; but confidential 
statements from references, while usually considered an indis- 
pensable part of the procedure, are, like application blanks, also 
in need of more scientific standardization. 
5. The applicant is interviewed. With the application blank 
in hand, the interviewer endeavors by questioning the applicant, 
and observing his appearance and behavior, to ascertain the type 
of work he desires and his probable fitness for that kind of work. 
If, as is frequently the case, the applicant has no clear idea of the 
kind of position he wants, a considerable part of the interview 
may consist in the interviewer’s giving him information about 
different kinds of work to help him decide intelligently. 
As with application blanks and inquiry letters, there is a 
need for better standardization of the interviewing methods. 
There can be no doubt that many interviewers place reliance on 
home-made or ready-made systems of ‘‘character reading” which 
are utterly without scientific value. Yet this part of the employ- 
ment procedure is one of the most crucial. Hollingworth’ and 
Scott and Clothier? show by striking illustrations how completely 
at variance with one another may be the judgments on the fitness 
of applicants which are made by professional interviewers, who

-P-A-G-E-160
    
150 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
differ from one another in the sort of questions they ask, the 
phrasing of those questions, the weight they attach to different 
sorts of reply, and the details of behavior from which they 
estimate the applicant’s habits and promise. 
Some of the most important facts which interviews and 
inquiries from references seek to elicit, it should be kept in mind, 
are not ability factors, but what may be called “character” 
and “personality” factors. Ability to do work is, after all, only 
one of the conditions which determine a worker’s success in a 
position. His moral habits, his perseverance, his personal agree- 
ableness, appearance, voice, carriage, manner, tactfulness, the 
strength of his ambition, his interest in his work—any of these 
may affect adversely the efficiency of a worker who possesses the 
ability to do a piece of work; or they may go far toward com- 
pensating for an inferior degree of ability. No tests are success- 
ful as yet in getting at these traits. Hence, the utilization of any 
and all means by which these characteristics may be determined 
in advance, and the scientific determination of the actual value 
of such means, constitute indispensable parts of the personnel 
program. 
6. In order to verify the applicant’s statements about his 
qualifications, to determine with greater accuracy the extent of 
those qualifications, or to discover them if unknown, the next 
step logically is to test the applicant. This will ordinarily be 
done by a special clerk, trained in the technique of giving and 
scoring tests and recording results. What has been said about 
the diversified problems of test administration applies primarily 
to the work of this individual. The decision as to the hiring 
or rejection of the applicant, and the position to which he 
shall be assigned if employed, is, however, ordinarily referred 
to the interviewer or some other responsible individual, in whose 
hands the test scores and all other significant data are brought 
together.
-P-A-G-E-161
TESTS IN THE PERSONNEL PROGRAM I5r 
7. At this point come any remaining details of the general- 
employment procedure, such as reaching an agreement about 
compensation, physical examination, provision for giving surety 
bond if one is required, giving the new employee general informa- 
tion, instructions, or rules, and introducing him to his new foreman 
or manager. 
8. Induction into the job is accomplished by a variety of 
methods, some systematic, some very haphazard. Often the 
new employee serves a ‘“‘probationary period,” and the final 
decision as to his retention is in theory deferred until the expira- 
tion of that period, unless he proves himself unfit before that time. 
Not infrequently this preliminary period is supplemented by 
training courses designed to fit the employee for advancement 
to more responsible positions. Of the possible uses of tests in 
such training programs, more will be said later. 
9. Following up the worker in his work is an indispensable 
part of sound personnel procedure. This is important not only 
in order to ascertain whether the worker’s value is increasing or 
decreasing, but to determine the actual success of the employ- 
ment procedure by means of which he was originally selected and 
placed. Follow-up methods are of many kinds. They include 
the maintenance and utilization of production records, measure- 
ment by standardized tests, interviews, supervisory methods, 
records of errors, of demerits, of attendance, of performance in 
training courses, and of other significant items, and periodical 
efficiency ratings. In some establishments, even where workers 
are carefully selected and placed, it is the usual thing for them 
then to be lost sight of, unless through some unusually good or 
unusually bad performance they force attention to themselves. 
Consequently, many good employees’ abilities are wasted, or 
their services are lost to the concern, because they are not given 
opportunities for development commensurate with their abilities. 
Measurement of ability, whether by tests or otherwise, after  
-P-A-G-E-162
  152 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
employment is hardly less important than measurement at the 
time of hiring. 
TESTS FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN EMPLOYMENT 
We turn now to the second of the general considerations men- 
tioned at the beginning of this chapter—that of the use of tests 
for other purposes than the original selection of workers. It is 
this use—hiring and placement—to which most attention has 
been given, and which has, in actual practice, been much the 
most conspicuous. It is at this initial point that the need of tests 
is most clearly apparent, because here the question of personal 
suitability is uppermost, and there is least opportunity to use 
such other methods as will become available only after the candi- 
date is actually in the firm’s employ. Some other directions in 
which tests are actually or potentially useful are, however, well 
worth considering. 
In the first place, psychological tests have a possible value 
in effecting transfers, promotions, and lay-offs, and in selecting 
employees for special duties. This is usually done on a basis of 
informal estimates or systematic ratings of workers, but the 
difficulty of getting reliable estimates for these and other pur- 
poses has led some personnel men to look to the more objective 
tests as a possible aid. In the training program, also, tests can 
be used to advantage. The measurement of aptitude for different 
types of training, the selection of individuals who are competent 
to advance more rapidly than others in training courses, the 
measurement of individual progress in training—these are tasks 
in which psychological tests give useful assistance. Likewise, the 
analysis of labor turnover has on several occasions been facili- 
tated and illuminated by studies of the relation of test scores to 
the duration of employment of workers in particular occupations. 
Work and fatigue studies, including investigations of the effect 
of such variable conditions as the relative distribution of work and 
rest periods, of hours of labor, and the like, have frequently
-P-A-G-E-163
  TESTS IN THE PERSONNEL PROGRAM 153 
utilized standardized tests as convenient measures of working 
efficiency under varying conditions. The comparisons of differ- 
ent work groups, based on sex, race, amount of schooling, age, 
and other distinguishing characteristics, or comparisons of groups 
of workers from different shops or departments, or of the workers 
in a given shop or department from year to year, are aided by 
studies of test scores. Finally, vocational guidance offers a 
field of great potential usefulness for tests as they increase in 
number and as our understanding of them becomes more perfect. 
Let us consider a few of these uses in a little further detail. 
TESTS IN TRAINING PROGRAMS 
Business establishments have developed a wide variety of 
methods for acquainting new employees with the details of the 
work to which they have been assigned, and of guiding them until 
they are able to work without constant supervision. Apprentice- 
ship systems, understudy methods, breaking-in by experienced 
employees, and vestibule schools or company schools of many 
kinds are designed to meet this need. Closely related to these 
introductory training courses are the various types of educational 
program, general or vocational, intramural or extramural, which 
most large and progressive business houses foster for the purpose 
of fitting their employees for promotion to more advanced work, 
or for the purpose of making good the educational deficiencies 
of those employees who have left school early. 
In both these classes of situations tests have made themselves 
useful. Preliminary tests (including general intelligence tests and 
other kinds of aptitude tests) are useful for selecting those who 
can profit by certain types of training and are an aid in placing 
them in courses best fitted to their capacities. Scott and 
Clothier’ report that ‘‘mental alertness” or general intelligence 
tests have been found to be better than amount of schooling as a 
basis for classifying employees in a factory training course, into 
t Personnel Management, chap. xxi.
-P-A-G-E-164
154 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
sections based on ability to progress with the course. In schools 
and colleges this classification of students into sections or groups 
for the purpose of facilitating instructional processes is one of 
the most important uses to which tests have been put. One who 
is interested in this problem will find a wealth of educational 
literature in books, periodicals, and monographs dealing with 
this and related practices. 
Proficiency tests of various sorts, both educational tests and 
trade tests, are useful for measuring the progress made by the 
learner, and they help also to determine the relative efficacy of 
various training methods. Toops, in his Trade Tests in Educa- 
tion, points out three types of use of such tests: (1) to test 
the learner’s progress and maintain his interest in trade instruc- 
tion; (2) to enable the educational director to make proper 
allowances for individual differences in the rate of acquiring a 
trade proficiency; (3) to aid in educational and vocational 
guidance and school-placement work. 
TESTS AND THE ANALYSIS OF LABOR TURNOVER 
One of the most studied problems of personnel maintenance 
is that of labor turnover, not only because of the enormous 
expense which a high percentage of labor mobility involves, but 
because of the difficulty in discovering its causes, and thus intro- 
ducing preventive measures. While the causes for the discharge 
of unsatisfactory employees are not uncommonly a matter of 
record, the reasons stated are usually superficial, and do not get 
at the root of the difficulty. Still more difficult is it to get at 
the causes of the voluntary separations, for even in the none-too- 
frequent instances where inquiry can be made, either because of 
the employee’s unwillingness or his inability to state the real 
reasons, the answers are likely to be worth little. Studies made 
by The Scott Company’ in several firms have shown that “mental 
alertness”’ (i.e., general intelligence) is a not insignificant factor 
tScott and Clothier, of. cit., chap. xxvi; A. J. Snow, “Turnover and the 
Mental Alertness Tests,” Journal of Applied Psychology, VII (1923), 285-90.
-P-A-G-E-165
  
TESTS IN THE PERSONNEL PROGRAM 155 
in this connection. Both test scores and age-grade status at time 
of leaving school have been used by them as indexes of relative 
brightness. Frequency of resignations, expression of desire to 
leave, and length of service have been used as indexes of stability. 
Characteristically, definite relationships have been found between 
the degree of mental ability and the stability of workers in various 
kinds of occupation. In one sort of work, repetitive and mo- 
notonous in nature, the curve which indicates instability is low 
for the less intelligent groups and rises rapidly as the degree of 
intelligence increases. Here the need of determining and using 
a “maximum critical score” in assigning workers to this type of 
work is suggested. In some other position the reverse relation- 
ship may be true. The less intelligent workers find the work 
too hard, and the more intelligent remain. In one case, stability 
was found high among women workers of low intelligence, falling 
rapidly as intelligence grades advanced, but rising again with 
the highest grades of intelligence. In this case, a more active 
promotional policy affecting the middle grade of workers was 
recommended, in order to prevent their leaving in too great 
numbers. In another group of clerks the greatest instability was 
found at two points: among the least intelligent and again 
among those of moderately high intelligence. An unsatisfactory 
wage condition was found to be the cause of the undesirable loss 
among a good grade of workers. Thus, while test scores may 
not in themselves tell directly the cause of the turnover, they 
may help to reveal the presence of certain causes of dissatisfac- 
tion, perhaps not clearly recognized by the workers. 
These and a great variety of other related problems point 
to the need of reliable test scores for determining general employ- 
ment policies, as well as in hiring individual workers. In most 
large business establishments it is a safe presumption that com- 
plete records of employees’ test scores, as well as of their pro- 
ductive efficiency, special interests and abilities, and the like 
will prove of great importance both for research and for admin- 
istrative purposes.

156 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
TESTS IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
Closely related to the problems we have been discussing, and 
particularly to those of vocational selection and vocational 
training, is the matter of vocational guidance. While the pri- 
mary responsibility for advising youth as to the choice of a voca- 
tion does not often fall directly on the business man, the status 
and prospect of vocational guidance in community and nation 
are matters of direct concern to him. His future labor problems 
will be made easier, and his relations with the schools of his 
community to which he looks to supply him with youthful 
recruits will be made more satisfactory, if the rising generation 
enjoys competent vocational counsel and training, based on a 
thorough and accurate understanding of the needs of society, 
the requirements of various industries, and the potentialities of 
each boy and girl. 
Moreover, as has been pointed out, it often becomes necessary, 
in actual practice, for the one in charge of hiring to give voca- 
tional counsel to applicants who do not themselves know just 
what kind of work they want or are fitted to do. Here the 
employment officer’s problem is much the same as the vocational 
counselor’s—to give the applicant vocational information, to 
help him discover his abilities and interests, and to guide him 
into that position in which he gives greatest promise of progress 
and success. 
Professional vocational counselors, whether connected or not 
with schools, have hitherto made much less use of psychological 
tests than it seems likely they will in the future. They have 
given major attention to other phases of the problem. In part 
this is because of the lack of sufficient accurate information 
about the requirements of different occupations; in part it is 
because we have almost no tests which have proved themselves 
useful for vocational guidance. 
More use has been made of general intelligence tests than 
any other kind. They seem to afford a helpful guide in narrow-
-P-A-G-E-167
  TESTS IN THE PERSONNEL PROGRAM 157 
ing the range of occupations within which the youth should make 
his choice. It is safe to predict that a boy whose general 
intelligence ranking is in the lower part of his high-school class 
should not ordinarily look forward to a professional career. 
One who stands still lower should limit his range of choice still 
farther. But in any case, we have not reached the point where 
we can say to him, “You should choose this, and only this, 
career.” Probably we never shall. There are too many other 
determining factors which psychological tests do not as yet 
enable us to measure. Some of these may ultimately be measur- 
able by tests; others will not. 
Assuming an adequate minimum of ability, one’s vocational 
interest—provided it be an intelligently informed interest and 
not merely a transitory whim—is probably one of the most useful 
vocational guides; for interest and ability are ordinarily closely 
related. Some work has been done with interest tests and 
questionnaires, but their technique is still in the experimental 
state. One present vocational need is to assemble and make 
accessible more full, specific, and authoritative vocational infor- 
mation in order that interest may be intelligently formed. Other 
factors which must help determine one’s choice include physical 
suitability, financial ability to acquire the necessary training, 
vocational opportunities or lack of opportunities in the com- 
munity, economic and other rewards. 
Inasmuch as vocational guidance and vocational training are 
inseparable phases of the problem of vocational suitability, we 
may expect that progress in standardizing trade tests will provide 
vocational schools and courses with another instrument which 
will help to select those of superior trade fitness, and thus to 
advise and assist them wisely. Test experimentation and the 
extension of job analyses are also helping us, little by little, in 
the same general direction. Tests of temperamental and voli- 
tional traits may sometime help still further to determine voca- 
tional fitness, as in all probability will many types of aptitude 
test. 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  158 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
But we are still far from having test information of wide 
applicability for vocational guidance purposes. We must expect 
the problem of guidance tests to be solved more slowly than that 
of employment tests, for there are greater inherent difficulties. 
Much of our needed knowledge for vocational guidance will 
come, however, from experimentation in employment psychology 
in business organizations. But this knowledge will have to be   
      
based on extensive test work in 
before we shall be able to say w 
> many business establishments 
th assurance that certain tests 
do indicate, in a useful way, superior vocational ability. 
One or two of the special difficulties of vocational guidance 
tests may be indicated by contrasting them with tests for selec- 
tion purposes. In the first place, most successful employment 
tests are suitable primarily for rather specialized occupations 
and within a somewhat restricted range. Successful guidance 
tests would have to discover more general trade abilities, and 
ought also to predict probable success in the higher and less 
definite levels of occupations. Selection methods begin with a 
specific set of requirements to be satisfied. The results of selec- 
tions can be checked, and in that way poor methods are elimi- 
nated and good methods can be demonstrated to work effectively. 
In guidance, on the other hand, the individual is taken with all 
his complexity of interests and abilities, and an attempt is made 
to find the best line of work for him among all the thousands of 
occupations. The results can rarely be checked, for there is no 
way of knowing certainly whether or not the individual would 
have succeeded better in some other direction. In the face of 
these and other difficulties, it is not surprising that little has been 
accomplished in the development of special vocational guidance 
tests.   OCCUPATIONAL INTELLIGENCE LEVELS ] 
But test scores are not wholly without significance for voca- 
tional guidance. The accompanying chart (p. 160), taken from 
Volume XV of the Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences, 
|
-P-A-G-E-169
  
  TESTS IN THE PERSONNEL PROGRAM 159 
entitled “Psychological Testing in the United States Army,” is 
suggestive not only for vocational guidance, but also for the 
employer of labor. 
This chart shows the variation between the average intel- 
ligence levels revealed by representatives of many different 
occupations among the drafted men in the United States Army 
of 1917-18. The lowest degree of intelligence was found among 
the unskilled laborers and the trades requiring least skill and 
training. Above these are the semi-skilled trades. Next come 
the skilled trades and the office and commercial occupations, 
demanding, as a rule, either more general education or more 
prolonged specific training or both, than the semi-skilled and 
unskilled occupations. Highest of all are the semi-professional 
and professional occupations, requiring more of a general educa- 
tional background, more exercise of independent judgment, more 
ready adaptability to changing situations. 
The chart shows not only the average (median) intelligence 
level for each occupation listed, but also, by means of the hori- 
zontal line, the range of the middle half of the men in that occupa- 
tion. That is, the least intelligent one-quarter and the most 
intelligent one-quarter are omitted, giving us a fairly clear 
picture of the average intelligence level of several representative 
occupations. 
These represent, of course, only a few of the many occupations. 
Further testing will probably extend the list. This has already 
been underteken by certain workers."

  TESTS IN THE PERSONNEL PROGRAM 161 
cited give of course no indication of these workers’ vocational 
success, other than that they reported these as being their 
previous occupations. 
But another equally important fact is revealed by the chart, 
that of the very great degree of overlapping between different 
occupations. For most of the skilled trades, the average 
intelligence ratings, as well as the middle half of the scores, are 
almost identical. An individual’s test score tells nothing about 
which of these trades offers him the greatest likelihood of success. 
Whether his particular aptitudes indicate that his best chances 
would be as a painter, a carpenter, a plumber, or a mechanic 
must be determined wholly by other means, such as special 
aptitude tests, studies of his specific interests, his training, his 
experience, his ambitions, and other factors not measured by 
intelligence tests. The most his test score can tell us is whether 
or not he has the necessary minimum of intelligence, and whether 
or not he has more than can profitably be utilized in these trades. 
Between occupations varying considerably in intelligence 
averages there is still perceptible overlapping, as, for example, 
between two such diverse occupations as those of dental officers 
and bakers or painters. Without more information than the 
chart gives us about the relative occupational success of the least 
intelligent one-third of the dental officers and of the most intel- 
ligent one-third of the bakers, we are not in a position to predict, 
on the basis of a test score which falls within this overlapping 
range, one’s relative prospect of success in these two occupations. 
Therefore, while the chart affords definite evidence that intel- 
ligence is one important factor in the hierarchy of occupations, 
from unskilled labor up to the professions, it tells little or nothing 
more than that. Successful guidance demands the use of 
measures of other and more specific traits. 
There is one other consideration which it is important to 
bear in mind in interpreting this chart of occupational intelligence 
levels. It may be that the intelligence test scores made by the   
    
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  162 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
people in any particular occupation are in part a result of the 
specially favorable or unfavorable influences of that occupation 
in preparing individuals for the kind of performance called for 
in intelligence tests. The scores, too, may be influenced by the 
amount and kind of education required for entrance into the 
different occupations. Clerks, for example, have much higher 
test scores than plumbers or tool makers. The ordinary inter- 
pretation of this is that the one group has more inherent intel- 
lectual ability than the other. But the difference may be due, 
in part, to the advantage the clerks have in practice with paper 
and pencil performances and with the sort of semi-clerical tasks 
included in the intelligence tests. It is also possible that they 
have had more formal schooling of a sort that would influence 
test scores. Similar possibilities obtain with respect to many 
others of the occupations compared. 
How large a part these influences play in producing the results 
shown in the chart, it is difficult tosay. They do at least suggest 
the need for caution in making interpretations. It may be, for 
example, that if all the plumbers and all the clerks reported in 
the test results had been tested when they were twelve years 
old, there would have been no difference between the groups. 
The difference may have come about wholly through the later 
influence of unlike training and the development of unlike 
interests. In that case, the chart would have no usefulness for 
vocational guidance purposes. In all probability this inter- 
pretation in such extreme form is not true. But there remains 
a question whether, in less extreme form, it may not contain 
considerable truth. 
SUMMARY 
From what has been said it should be clear, now, that there 
is more involved in the use of tests in busines. than is included 
in a description of the scientific methods employed in standardiz- 
ing and evaluating tests. There is more, too, than is added by a 
consideration of the results that have been secured through the
-P-A-G-E-173
  TESTS IN THE PERSONNEL PROGRAM 163 
application of test research methods. Research and research 
accomplishments do serve as the solid basis on which progress 
in employment tests must rest. But in actually putting tests 
to use, other problems and other applications appear. 
The tasks of planning and administering test procedure, of 
recording and interpreting test results, and of co-ordinating the 
testing program with other parts of the employment process— 
these matters call for careful study and intelligent handling. 
The value of tests is determined by the way they are used as 
well as by the merits of the tests themselves. Most of these 
problems that arise in connection with the use of tests are specific 
matters which must be solved in terms of the given situation. 
Hence we have made little attempt to offer genera! principles 
for effective test administration. But these adjustments in 
each specific case are none the less important and worthy of 
most careful consideration. ; 
The use of tests, we have also emphasized, is not limited to 
the initial hiring of workers. Tests are of value in many other 
personnel activities, both administrative and research. On the 
administrative side they have been used in such ways as selecting 
men for training and in measuring their progress during training, 
in selecting men for transfer and promotion, and in helping to 
make sound vocational counsel possible. On the research side 
they have shown their possibilities by assisting in detailed 
analyses of labor turnover, in comparisons of different working 
groups, in explaining inadequate individual output, and so on. 
New and unforeseen uses appear when least expected. It would 
certainly, at the present time, be ill-advised to think of tests as 
too narrowly restricted in their scope and possibilities. Poten- 
tially they may do much. Actually, however, let us recall that 
we have only a few promising beginnings in any of the directions 
that have been mentioned.

  CHAPTER VI 
THE OUTLOOK FOR TESTS IN BUSINESS 
Any just estimate of the prospects for psychological testing 
in business must take into consideration a number of factors. 
It must consider the present extent of their use, both in this 
country and abroad. It must take account of the attitude, 
present and prospective, of the various parties interested in the 
problems which tests endeavor to solve. It must point out the 
conditions which operate to affect the future use and develop- 
ment of tests, for good or ill. To these considerations the present 
chapter will be devoted. 
PRESENT EXTENT OF USE OF TESTS 
It is easy to overestimate the present status of the psy- 
chological testing movement in business, both the extent of use 
of tests and the degree of their perfection. So much has been 
said and written about their possibilities that the uninformed 
enthusiast is likely to think of testing as a well-established part 
of the employment practice in most large business establishments. 
The truth is quite the opposite. However many concerns there 
may be which have more or less seriously considered the adoption 
of such methods, certainly only a small percentage have made 
any attempts at all to use them, and only a fraction of these 
have undertaken test research in any really serious, persistent, 
scientific fashion. Attempts to enumerate those American 
concerns which are known (by published reference or personal 
inquiry) to have used tests to any considerable degree reveal not 
more than two score. The actual number is probably larger 
than this, but at most amounts to only a handful. It should, 
furthermore, be borne in mind that even in the majority of these 
164
-P-A-G-E-175
  THE OUTLOOK FOR TESTS IN BUSINESS 165 
the use is confined to a few tests for only a part of the positions 
and does not often amount to an organized and comprehensive 
test program.* 
Before the war little more had been done than to talk about 
using tests. The experience of the American army with psycho- 
logical tests on a wholesale scale brought them into prominence, 
but most of the enthusiasm over employment tests immediately 
following the war subsided during the business contraction of 
1920. A few concerns which had hastily and uncritically adopted 
tests of the intelligence-test type abandoned them on finding that 
they failed to prove valuable for uses to which they should never 
have been put. 
INDUSTRIAL TESTS IN EUROPE? 
Nevertheless, testing has been taken up more extensively in 
American industry than it has in Great Britain and France, 
where hardly more than a half-dozen large firms have adopted 
any extensive testing program. In the main, British practices 
have followed those in this country. Their literature is full of 
citations of American test literature, although numerous British 
psychologists, including Burt, Spearman, Muscio, Watts, and 
others should be named among the more significant contributors 
to vocational psychology. But, as a rule, British industrial 
psychologists have concerned themselves chiefly with problems 
of optimal work conditions and methods, fatigue studies, and 
motion studies. The content of the phrase, “business psychol- 
ogy,” is quite different there from here. 
The 1921 report of the National Association of Corporation Training listed 
thirty-two firms which reported using tests, in more or less—usually less—thorough- 
going fashion. 
? Brief discussions of European progress with tests in business may be found 
in the following: M. S. Viteles, “Psychology in Business—in England, France, and 
Germany,” Annals of the American Academy (November, 1923), pp. 207-20; 
H. D. Kitson, “Industrial Psychology in Europe,” Journal of Applied Psychology, 
V (2921), 287-90.
-P-A-G-E-176
    166 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
In France, tests have gained no foothold in the business world, 
owing to the conservatism, even skepticism, of the French busi- 
ness man toward scientific improvement of business methods. 
Nevertheless, one or two experimentalists (Lahy being the best 
known) have undertaken research problems in this direction. 
In Germany, on the other hand, vocational selection by tests 
has received much attention from both psychologists and busi- 
ness men. Post-war Germany has been alert to the necessity 
of using all available scientific methods for reducing waste and 
increasing efficiency in production if industrial prestige is to be 
regained. Street railways and state railways have used tests 
both for selecting workers and in connection with apprentice- 
ship training; and several lines of manufacturing—the metal 
trades and printing trades, especially—have been reported as 
adopting similar practices on quite an extensive scale. In the 
present political and economic crisis in Germany it is difficult 
to state facts or make predictions which will be true a few months 
later. We know that German industrial psychologists have 
been very active in devising and trying out tests in large numbers; 
but their published reports are very deficient in the statistical 
data necessary to enable us to evaluate their success. It is for 
this reason that earlier chapters have made comparatively little 
reference tothem. ‘There are indications,’ however, of a growing 
recognition of the need for a more scientific checking up of the 
actual results of tests which are in use. There is also evidence 
that some of the tests, such as are used in the post-office and in 
various workshops, have demonstrated their real value in 
selecting better workers. ‘That the test idea has gained definite 
standing in Germany seems beyond dispute. 
Nor, while we are considering the present status of tests in 
business, must we overestimate the finality and perfection of 
what has been done even where based upon sound research

THE OUTLOOK FOR TESTS IN BUSINESS 167 
methods. Establishments which have done the most with 
tests are cautious, although in general optimistic, in expressing 
their conclusions on the subject. The truth about the present 
status of psychological testing may be summarized somewhat as 
follows. 
Industrial tests are still in the experimental stage. But they 
have proved worth experimenting with. A scientific technique 
has been well established. A few definite general principles and 
a considerable number of facts of more restricted scope about the 
selective value of tests have been proved. What we need now 
is to accumulate, with the aid of this technique, a much larger 
body of facts. We need negative as well as positive facts. We 
need to know also the relative value of selective methods other 
than tests. We need to know what tests and methods fail to 
select, as well as what ones succeed; and we need to know the 
relative degree of their success. We know something about 
selecting suitable employees for a considerable number of occupa- 
tions, and a great deal concerning a few. But about most occupa- 
tions we know little or nothing of scientific worth. 
UNDEVELOPED FIELDS 
We do not know, for example, what tests will select competent 
executives, although there is evidence that general intelligence 
has something to do with it. But many highly intelligent men 
are failures as executives, and some executives who would make 
mediocre intelligence test scores do get things done effectively. 
There are dynamic factors in personality, not describable in 
intelligence terms, and not yet adequately measurable by tests 
or any other device, which go far to determine success as an 
executive. We use such ill-defined and unanalyzed terms as 
“initiative,” “aggressiveness,” “leadership,” “courage,” and 
the like, to describe them. There are also important social 
factors—interests, “social intelligence” and the like—which are 
likely to affect success in this as in other occupations. Just what
-P-A-G-E-178
168 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
these ‘‘non-intellectual” determining factors are, and how to 
detect and measure them, is a task for the future. : 
The selection of salesmen is in a somewhat similar state. We 
do know that the term “‘salesman” is only a blanket term for a 
very wide range of occupations, dealing with a vast diversity 
of commodities, calling for very different types of personal 
qualifications, and having, in short, only one common feature— 
that they all sell something. Here again, intelligence, or any 
single mental aptitude which can at present be tested, is usually 
less of a determining factor in success than are interests and 
social adaptability. 
None of the learned professions have been adequately 
surveyed from the vocational test angle. In engineering educa- 
tion and the profession of teaching, a start has been made, 
enough to reveal the complexities and difficulty of the problem. 
As in the case of executives, we know that intelligent teachers 
are often poor teachers, and rather unintelligent teachers often 
do well. 
When we turn to the fine arts and many of the practical arts, 
the extent of our knowledge is equally limited. The tests we 
have for these occupations merely scratch the surface. The able 
and scientific work done by the numerous competent workers 
mentioned in earlier chapters touches only a small fraction of 
the thousands of trades and occupations, and can be regarded 
as conclusive, even provisionally, in only a few of these. But 
trails have been blazed and we may hope that coming years will 
bring richer contributions to our understanding of these fields. 
FACTORS DETERMINING TEST PROGRESS 
The, outlook for psychological tests in business cannot be 
predicted categorically. Their future depends on the attitude 
and actions of at least four groups of people, who have, potenti- 
ally, a direct interest in the problem of the scientific determina- 
tion of vocational fitness. These four are:
-P-A-G-E-179
  
THE OUTLOOK FOR TESTS IN BUSINESS 169 
1. The psychologists and others interested in the technical 
side of test research and test administration. 
2. The workers who are to be selected or guided by the aid 
of tests. 
3. The public, who will be affected, directly and indirectly, by 
any method which promotes or hinders the more efficient utiliza- 
tion of human resources in social and industrial organization. 
4. The employers, who are responsible for determining policies, 
initiating research programs, appointing technical experts, and 
adopting or rejecting programs and methods which the experts 
may propose for their consideration. 
Of the interest of the technical workers, nothing further need 
be said. They have proved that the problem is one which they 
can and are willing to attack. They are active and productive. 
Their numbers, while not in the aggregate large, are growing 
about as fast as the demand increases. Every university and 
most colleges offer one or more courses in psychological tests 
or personnel methods, and a great many men and women each 
year receive advanced degrees representing training in research 
methods which bear directly or indirectly on this kind of work. 
Some go into other business pursuits; some into college or uni- 
versity teaching; many with training in test research are to be 
found in educational administration. It can safely be assumed 
that as the demand becomes intensified, workers trained in 
applied psychology will come from the laboratories or from other 
pursuits to meet that demand. 
ATTITUDE OF LABOR TOWARD TESTS 
About the attitude of the second party—the worker—it is 
not so easy to speak definitely. It is clear that a favorable, 
co-operative attitude on the part of those tested is one of the 
pre-conditions of success with this method. But when we look 
for an answer, we are struck with the paucity of evidence, one 
way or another. There has been no such definite, conscious  
-P-A-G-E-180
  170 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
formulation and expression of favor or hostility to tests as there 
has been with reference to certain other attempts to apply scien- 
tific methods to labor problems, such as “Scientific Manage- 
ment.’* Indeed, there is no single attitude. Those who have 
worked with tests know that individuals in a group vary greatly in 
their reactions. Most, probably, take it as a matter of course. 
Like filling out application blanks, giving references, and submit- 
ting to interview, it is something to be gone through with, and that 
is all. Others are frankly curious and interested. Still others 
express scorn or disgust, if not indignation. Link? describes the 
favorable, often genuinely intelligent, comments of workers to 
whom he had explained the general purpose of the selective 
tests he was introducing: ‘‘That’s not physicology,” said one, 
“that’s common sense.” 
It need not be surprising that labor, particularly class- 
conscious, organized labor, sometimes views with a little suspicion 
the introduction of selective methods of this type. We can 
always expect the attitude of hostility and suspicion with which 
men who distrust the motives of their employers greet any innova- 
tion which seems to them to have for its purpose increasing profits 
at their expense, whether or not their suspicions have any real 
grounds. A part of this is, of course, the general attitude of 
hostility toward anything new and little understood. But 
occasionally this attitude of suspicion toward scientific innova- 
tion receives more definite expression. Hoxie, in this country, 
and others elsewhere have shown the prevailing attitude of 
hostility to scientific management to be due not to the principle 
involved, but to abuses in its practice. Workers have seen it 
used in diverse ways as devices for getting more work out of 
them without equivalent recompense. 
While there has been little conspicuous expression of such an 
attitude with reference to tests, it is not impossible that organ-

  THE OUTLOOK FOR TESTS IN BUSINESS 17I 
izations of skilled labor might be led to think of selective tests as 
an infringement on their peculiar prerogatives to say who should 
or should not enter certain lines of employment. They can, how- 
ever, easily be led to see tests as a useful instrument in recruiting 
their ranks, classifying their members, and raising their standards 
of competency. Unorganized and unskilled labor might con- 
ceivably be led to think of tests as an instrument for discriminat- 
ing against them, putting them out of their jobs, or making mere 
machines of them. They should, on the contrary, be helped to 
think of tests as a way of discovering and utilizing their own 
resources more adequately. To know that these suspicions are 
short-sighted and baseless is not enough. It is the obligation of 
every employer who introduces tests, and of every psychologist 
who works with them, to use care and tact, to regard them him- 
self, and to describe them to others, in terms of their larger social 
perspective. — 
SIGNIFICANCE OF VOCATIONAL TESTING TO LABOR 
AND THE PUBLIC 
Viewed from the standpoint of their broadest social utility, 
selective tests are not only profitable to the employer, but they 
are also of vital importance to the worker and of real significance 
to society at large. This is equally true of other selective devices 
besides tests. Indeed, there are those who assert that the justi- 
fication for all improved personnel methods in industry is not 
the economic gain, but the enhancement of human welfare, and, 
specifically, the welfare of the worker. 
It should be recognized clearly that neither psychology nor 
any other science is inherently partisan. Pure science seeks to 
discover truth; applied science seeks to put that truth to 
the service of human ends. Whose ends it is used to further 
depends not on the science itself, but on who it is that cares to 
utilize the science. That tests and other selective devices have 
been utilized more commonly by employers than by labor does 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  172 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
not mean that they are of value only to the former; still less, 
that they are in any degree antagonistic to the interests of the 
latter. A worker-owned plant would find psychological tests as 
useful as do plants in the management of which workers have no 
voice. Whatever makes for the more adequate discovery of a 
worker’s resources and their more effective utilization is of the 
utmost significance to him. 
Suppose that every man could know just that life-work in 
which his personal endowment would bring him the maximum 
of success and the minimum of failure and disappointment. His 
increased efficiency and higher productivity would mean increased 
earnings. But this would be the least of his gains. It would 
mean increased likelihood of advancement to higher levels in his 
occupation, with better remuneration, greater opportunities, 
and more certain tenure. It would mean more leisure, strength, 
and means for recreations. It would mean less of the discontent 
that economic maladjustment always brings. It would mean 
more of the happiness that comes from the sense of achievement, 
and more of that absorbing interest which is called forth only 
by those activities one can do best. 
But not alone do employer and employee profit by the advan- 
tages of successful programs of occupational selection and 
guidance. Society at large has as direct an interest in the utili- 
zation of human resources to their maximal efficiency. One of 
the major causes of high living costs is wastefulness in production. 
And there is no wastefulness so far-reaching as that of misdirected 
human activity. When we read repeatedly of the reduction of 
labor costs from 5 per cent to 50 per cent through the introduc- 
tion of improved working methods and the better selection and 
placement of workers, the possibilities of saving to society are 
seen to be enormous. Not only the monetary saving, moreover, 
but the higher standards of living and the consequent enrich- 
ment of life would be shared by a society organized on the prin- 
ciple of every man in the best possible place.
-P-A-G-E-183
  THE OUTLOOK FOR TESTS IN BUSINESS 173 
A democratic social organization, we know, does not mean 
equality in the sense of equality of ability and responsibility, 
for there is no such thing. Individual differences do exist and 
must be taken into account. So also must racial differences. 
Tests have helped to make clear the nature and extent of these 
differences. But a critical survey of all the facts seems to 
support neither of two extreme positions which we find vigor- 
ously debated today, with reference to the significance of tests 
for democracy. Such a survey hardly warrants the pessimistic 
claims of those who quote test results to prove the impending 
decline of American civilization. But no more does it support 
those who, opposing what they term an “undemocratic, educa- 
tional determinism,” condemn testers for recognizing and mak- 
ing educational provision for individual differences. 
A genuinely democratic society is not one where everyone is 
leveled down to a mediocre plane, but one in which everyone has 
equal opportunity—that is, the utmost possible opportunity— 
to discover, develop, and utilize his own particular abilities to 
the best advantage, consistent with equal opportunities to others. 
Such an ideal can be realized only when society has both the 
disposition and the means by which to enable each one to dis- 
cover his own capacities and weaknesses, and to be guided into 
an occupation suitable thereto. 
Such considerations as these bear directly on the employee’s 
attitude toward tests. The clear recognition of these facts will 
go far to facilitate the introduction of scientific selection methods 
on a large scale and with a minimum of friction. The methods 
by which one can insure that potential opposition from employees 
will be turned into cordial co-operation will vary with circum- 
stances. In many establishments, shop committees or other 
representatives of labor share in determining working conditions. 
In such places the logical procedure, it would seem, is for the 
administration of any program of vocational selection to be 
carried out under joint control. In other establishments, where 
Be.
-P-A-G-E-184
  174 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
no such joint control is practiced, the employer can doubt- 
less do much to decrease potential opposition by a straight- 
forward, judicious presentation of the whole plan. He should 
lay all his cards on the table, and make it clear that the employees 
have as much to gain by it as the employer. 
THE FUTURE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING IN BUSINESS 
It is clear that the testing movement is not an enterprise 
that can safely be left to advance by its own momentum. It 
may have a future that is scientifically sound and economically 
profitable. Or it may bring itself into disrepute. Which of 
these it shall be depends less, perhaps, on the psychologists than 
on the attitude of those who are ultimately responsible for busi- 
ness policies—business men themselves. If employers are con- 
tent to turn over their employment problems to any irresponsible, 
self-styled psychologist or character-analyst who happens along, 
or to minor executives or clerks, without adequate scientific train- 
ing, scientific personnel research will be set back indefinitely. 
If, on the other hand, employers realize that continued test 
research is absolutely essential, and that only intelligent and 
technically competent specialists can be safely intrusted to do 
that research and to oversee the introduction and administra- 
tion of scientific employment programs, the testing movement 
may be expected to go on steadily to greater success and profit. 
Furthermore, the business man can do a great deal to effect the 
success or failure of even the best-trained investigator’s 
researches. Test research, to be successful, has to be carried out 
under the most favorable conditions, and only the business man 
himself can say whether these conditions shall be provided. 
CONDITIONS OF SUCCESS IN BUSINESS RESEARCH 
Important among these conditions may be mentioned the 
following. To be successful, test research must be conducted: 
1. Under laboratory conditions in business establishments 
2. Continuously
-P-A-G-E-185
  
THE OUTLOOK FOR TESTS IN BUSINESS 175 
3. Co-operatively 
4. With adequate resources in the way of personnel and 
production records 
5. With intelligent and hearty co-operation of executives and 
employers 
6. As an integral part of the personnel selection and main- 
tenance program. 
Let us consider these six conditions of success in a little more 
detail. 
1. Test research to be successful must be conducted under 
actual laboratory conditions in business establishments. This 
may seem contradictory, but it is both possible and necessary. 
It has been found indispensable in other lines of industrial 
research. Some of the finest and best-conducted chemical, 
electrical, and mechanical laboratories are today to be found in 
manufacturing plants. Similar facilities must be provided for 
personnel research. On the technical side there must be 
competent research workers, with adequate physical facilities 
and equipment, which in psychological testing work are ordinarily 
much simpler than in chemical or electrical research. There 
must be freedom from external, economic pressure to “show 
results.” Valuable discoveries cannot be made to order. Often 
weeks or months may be spent in the fruitless search for an 
elusive device or fact which may turn up at a time and place 
when least expected. Such conditions, facilities, and opportuni- 
ties are provided by university research laboratories, and this 
has made the modern university so prolific a center of discovery 
and advancement. In practical fields, business enterprises which 
seek to profit by scientific methods must provide similar 
opportunities. 
Effective research on practical personnel problems can be 
done only in close contact with the actual work situation, and 
under working conditions. The university laboratory, with all 
its resources, still lacks the essential materials for personnel 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  176 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
study—-employees at their work. Tests are of real value only 
when they measure abilities as they are actually exercised on 
the job. This means that the investigator must have constant 
access to the men he needs for his purposes, and that he must 
have the cordial co-operation of foremen and executives—-in 
practice by no means an easy condition to realize. The intelli- 
gent and tactful psychologist will, needless to say, make an effort 
to fit his own plans, so far as it is at all possible, into those of 
the executives with whom he deals. But just in so far as he is 
limited by their failure to co-operate, just in so far will his find- 
ings fail to represent accurately the real working conditions. 
2. Test research, to be successful, must be continuous. The 
problem of finding the best selective methods cannot be settled 
once for all. Work conditions and distribution of duties are 
constantly changing in every large establishment. Job titles 
are not accurately indicative of the character of the work done. 
So it is necessary constantly to check up and revise the methods 
of selection, not only to improve them but to keep them workable 
under changing conditions. 
It has been pointed out, moreover, that while a set of tests 
may be standardized on a group of old employees and then used 
for selecting new employees, those tests are much more likely to 
be of maximum usefulness if the test scores made by new 
employees are checked against their own later records. This, of 
course, means a continuous, and not sporadic, research program. 
CO-OPERATIVE RESEARCH 
3. The varied and intricate problems of personnel research 
which concern any business organization can never be solved 
completely by any one individual, no matter how competent 
he may be. They demand the combined efforts, experiences, and 
judgment of many investigators, each working in his own corner 
of the field, but sharing his findings and views with others. It 
has been repeatedly pointed out that selective methods which
-P-A-G-E-187
THE OUTLOOK FOR TESTS IN BUSINESS 177 
have proved successful in one establishment may or may not 
prove successful in another. Prolonged, co-operative inquiry 
into the exact effect upon these methods of varying environ- 
mental, administrative, technical, and social conditions is indis- 
pensable if we are ever to formulate them as general principles 
of practice. 
The rapid and successful development of the army psy- 
chological testing program in 1917 and 1918 illustrated strikingly 
what co-operative effort can accomplish. ‘There is every reason 
to believe that co-operative research can become a normal basis 
of procedure in industrial psychology as it is coming to be in 
other lines. Men trained in our universities—the largest source, 
by far, of trained personnel workers—are almost wholly free from 
the traditional petty jealousies and short-sighted self-interest 
which have hampered progress in competitive society, but which 
are now rapidly decreasing. Scientists do not hesitate to make 
public their findings and to share in the results of others’ work. 
In one form or another, co-operative research in the scientific 
world is an accepted principle. As the business world sees more 
clearly the mutual advantages of co-operative research, and 
that effective personnel administration is more than a mere 
matter of increased profits and decreased costs, the extension 
of the principle into business research may be expected to follow. 
Co-operative research can be carried on in many ways. 
A first way, which is co-operative in effect if not in form, is 
the wide sharing of research findings in individual investigations 
through the medium of various journals and their further trial, 
criticism, revision, and improvement in other situations. Among 
the many fruitful sources of suggestion in this field are the 
Journal of Personnel Research, the Journal of Applied Psychology, 
Industrial Management, Management and Administration (and 
its two predecessors, Administration and Management Engineer- 
ing), the Annals of the American Academy, the Journal of the 
National Institute for Industrial Psychology (British), Praktische 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  
  178 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS ~ 
Psychologie (German), and many others, to which footnote 
references have been made in earlier chapters. Reports of pro- 
ceedings of the Personnel Research Federation, and of other 
conferences of psychologists, personnel workers, labor leaders, 
employment managers, and others serve a like function. 
Another type of semi-co-operative research utilizes the 
research facilities and skill provided by departments of psy- 
chology in our universities. Although very few doctors of 
philosophy in psychology are devoting their major attention to 
industrial research, a much larger number have a secondary 
interest in it, frequently supplemented by practical experience. 
The Psychological Corporation,’ organized in 1921, has as one 
of its major objects the bringing about of a closer relationship 
between the competent psychologists of the nation and business 
firms with psychological problems. While this is, of course, 
co-operative research only in a limited sense, it is a definite step 
in that direction. 
The private, independent research organization, of which 
there are a number in the field of personnel, affords another 
type of medium for sharing and testing findings. One example 
of such organizations is The Scott Company. The men in this 
group undertook numerous important research investigations 
in various cities in the years following the war and added measur- 
ably to our understanding of methods and devices for dealing 
more effectively with workers as individuals. It is significant, 
however, that their experiences sharply brought out the necessity 
of having, inside each business organization, as a permanent 
part of its executive staff, one or more trained personnel workers 
to facilitate and to carry on the work initiated by outside investi- 
gators. No personnel program can be carried on wholly from 
the outside, nor can it ever be self-operative. 
An example of what co-operative research can do is afforded 
by the Division of Applied Psychology and the Bureau of 
tJ. McK. Cattell, “The Psychological Corporation,” Anmals of the American 
Academy (November, 1923), pp. 165-71.

Personnel Research at the Carnegie Institute of Technology,’ 
active for several years in carrying on research with business 
organizations in Pittsburgh and other cities, in inspiring the 
establishment of like enterprises elsewhere, and in training pro- 
fessional personnel research workers. Other institutes and 
bureaus with similar aims are to be found in this and other 
countries. Sometimes these are affiliated with universities and 
sometimes they are independent. Under various forms of 
organization they afford an arrangement whereby business 
houses having similar problems unite to maintain a co-operative 
bureau employing trained workers. 
Such a program involves many difficult and delicate problems 
of maintenance, but it has definitely proved its worth, both by 
way of actual achievement and in promise of larger usefulness. 
Other extensive co-operative organizations and enterprises, in 
a variety of forms, have found their inspiration, their methods, 
and their workers in the Carnegie Institute, the National 
Research Council,? or other research organizations. Among 
them may be mentioned the Life Insurance Sales Research 
Bureau,3 and the Bureau of Public Personnel Administration,‘ 
which are carrying on investigations of mutual interest and far- 
reaching significance.   
      
THE NEED FOR BETTER PERSONNEL RECORDS 
4. Test research, to be successful, must have at its command 
better criteria for ascertaining scientifically the comparative 
value of different tests and other selective devices. While this

is, of course, primarily a matter of technical procedure, it does 
concern the employer. It demands that he shall provide more 
extensive, more accurate, and better-kept records than most 
establishments keep, not only of many details of the personal 
history of each worker and his employment, but also of his pro- 
motions, transfers, and salary increases, his errors, his output, his 
efficiency ratings, and any other possible measure of his personal 
value to the organization. A selective test can be no more valid 
than the standard against which its validity is checked. 
5. Test research, to be successful, must have the intelligent 
and hearty co-operation of employers, minor executives, and 
employees. To this end, the investigator should be a recognized 
part of the regular staff of the organization, with opportunities 
for wide contacts and far-reaching observation. If he is an 
outsider, he can produce results only if he has the constant 
assistance of a competent, technically trained man who is a 
permanent part of the organization, endowed with authority 
to command the facilities and resources that have been described. 
He should have the support of the administration in his efforts 
to allay the suspicious attitude on the part of workers and fore- 
men, so frequently noticed when an ill-understood innovation is 
introduced into the routine of work. 
EMPLOYERS MUST HAVE A SCIENTIFIC ATTITUDE 
But perhaps of still greater importance is an intelligent and 
sympathetic attitude on the part of his superiors, and particu- 
larly those who are responsible for policies. A program of per- 
sonnel research can be successfully undertaken and carried 
through only when the responsible official has a genuinely 
scientific attitude toward the project. This does not, however, 
mean that he must be technically trained. Perhaps it is better . 
if he has not even a smattering of psychological jargon. But 
it is essential that he shall display certain qualities which are 
indispensable in the successful pursuit of scientific research.
-P-A-G-E-191
THE OUTLOOK FOR TESTS IN BUSINESS 181 
a) He must have a real appreciation of the meaning of special- 
ized technical training. The sound judgment of a successful 
business man is often revealed in his recognition of his own 
limitations, his willingness to refer technical matters to competent 
specialists and abide by their recommendations, and his ability 
to find and retain such competent technologists. 
b) He must be scientifically impartial. Whatever his own 
opinions may be, he must be willing to submit them to the test 
of experiment, and abide by the results. He must have mastered 
the fine art of maintaining an attitude of suspended judgment 
about questions on which there is not yet sufficient evidence to 
make a decision. 
c) He must be critical yet open-minded; critical enough to 
demand adequate proof, but sufficiently intelligent to recognize 
proof when he sees it, and open-minded enough to accept 
it, even at the expense of discarding his own preformed 
opinions. 
d) Finally, he must be patient. As has been mentioned, 
scientific research is often a long-drawn-out game, one that 
taxes the patience not only of the investigator but even more 
the patience of the employer who is eager for practical results. 
Probably nothing has hampered scientific research in business 
so much as the impatience of employers. Too often they under- 
take a research project in much the spirit that a child seizes a 
new toy which promises him much pleasure, but of which he 
quickly tires as the novelty wears off. Such an attitude is fatal 
to successful research. No executive has any right to undertake 
a scientific research project in his establishment if he is not willing 
to wait a long time, if need be, for results, and to give the investi- 
gator carte-blanche to whatever time and whatever facilities he 
needs to make it a success. To undertake it with any other 
spirit is to waste his own money and the scientist’s time, and to 
bring scientific research into disrepute. With the administra- 
tion of devices which research has provided, the case is different. 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  182 PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS IN BUSINESS 
Here he has a right, within the bounds of reason, to demand 
results and set dates. But research can never be forced. 
TESTS ONLY A PART OF PERSONNEL RESEARCH 
6. Finally, test research, to be successful, must be made and 
treated as a part of the entire program of personnel selection and 
maintenance. On the one hand it ties up intimately with job 
analyses and job specifications. Tests can be made of the widest 
usefulness only when occupations are more thoroughly stand- 
ardized, the country through, than is now the case. A few 
attempts have been made in this direction, but the task is a 
staggering one under present conditions. But within the indi- 
vidual business establishment, the two undertakings are insepar- 
able. On the other hand, testing is, as has been repeatedly 
pointed out, only one method of vocational selection, one part 
of a wide series of closely interrelated investigations that need 
to be made if a vocational selection program is to be thoroughly 
intelligent and successful. Test research must be supplemented 
by research into the prognostic value of such personal data as 
age, sex, marital status, amount of schooling, previous experience, 
references and recommendations, methods of character judgment 
and of interviewing, value of photographs and of personal appear- 
ance as criteria of character, and a host of other possible indexes 
of character and ability. While none of these may be as valu- 
able, in some occupations, as well-chosen tests, there is always 
the possibility that they may have some value, and that as 
supplementary to tests they may serve to make selection and 
placement even more successful. 
In still another direction, testing relates itself to the vexing 
problem of measuring the efficiency of workers already in service, 
by means of records of production, success records, error records, 
and, very commonly, rating-scale systems. No one of these 
See, for example, the Descriptions of Occupations, prepared for the United 
States Employment Service by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1919. 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
  THE OUTLOOK FOR TESTS IN BUSINESS 183 
related problems can be settled independently of the test problem, 
and tests themselves cannot be selected successfully without 
due regard to the accuracy of alternative or supplementary 
methods of judging personal fitness. 
But enthusiasm for research, whether with tests or other 
personnel methods, should never be permitted to obscure the fact 
that coefficients of correlation and tables of averages are not 
ends in themselves. They are only means to the one all- 
important end, that of arriving at a better understanding of the 
individual worker. The reason that scientific personnel methods 
are less commonly used in small than in large establishments is 
because they are less needed. In the small shop the worker is 
known to his employer as an actual human being. In the large 
establishment he is only.a unit; as a person he is lost in the 
crowd. The function of scientific personnel devices is to find 
him again, to come to understand him, his abilities and his 
motives; and to make his personality, so far as possible, a matter 
of record, in order that he shall not be lost sight of again. 
THE BROAD MOVEMENT TO STUDY MEN 
Psychological tests, then, are seen to be only one small part 
of the broad problem of understanding the human factor. As the 
nineteenth century was the era of unprecedented progress in 
the natural sciences and the technologies they made possible, so 
the indications are that the twentieth century is to be marked 
by great advances in our understanding of men and our control 
of human energies. Some far-sighted thinkers are proclaiming 
their conviction that our increasing mastery of physical forces 
is a potential source of disaster to civilization, unless man’s 
increasing control of gigantic agencies of power and of destruc- 
tion is paralleled by an equally great development of his under- 
standing and control of himself. It is not only the business 
world that is interested in finding better methods of under- 
standing people. The same interest is reflected in the publishers’

catalogues, the library call-lists, the columns of newspapers and 
magazines, on the stage, the screen, and the pages of the popular 
novel, as well as in the growth of the university departments of 
physiology, psychology, anthropology, and sociology. It is in 
the air about us. 
The business world is increasingly awake to the various prob- 
lems which the human factor presents—the problems of analyz- 
ing, measuring, and understanding men, both workers and con- 
sumers, their character, their motives, and their abilities; the 
problems of changing men, of modifying their motives and inter- 
ests, and training their abilities; the problems of providing such 
conditions, physical, psychological, and social, as shall enable 
them to accomplish their ends with the greatest success and the 
least pains. Any devices and methods will be valued which 
can prove helpful in this drive to substitute intelligent under- 
standing and control for guesswork and prejudice in the realm of 
human action. So far as tests can aid, we may be optimistic as 
to their future.

  APPENDIX 
SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER READING 
The following list is not intended to serve as a complete bibliography. 
Its purpose is merely to suggest to the interested reader some of the books 
which will give him further information about psychological tests and their 
use in business. Footnotes throughout this book offer additional sugges- 
tions along the same line. 
A still more extensive body of literature deals with the uses that have 
been made of psychological tests in schools. Although no detailed refer-

directly relevant to the use of tests in business.

  PREFACE 
Little material has heretofore been presented 
in the field of extra-curricular activities. This 
volume is the result of the writer’s efforts to 
gather practical material to present to summer 
school classes in secondary administration and 
to high school teachers of a large city school 
system. After giving these courses for the past 
three years in the summer sessions of Colorado 
State Teachers College and in Extra-mural 
‘Classes of the University of Pittsburgh and 
Pennsylvania State College, the author decided 
to present in book form the substance of the 
material used in these classes for the benefit of 
teachers of education, high school teachers, and 
principals elsewhere. 
The writer believes that there is an intense 
interest in this phase of the secondary program 
at the present time and expresses the hope that 
this interest may grow so rapidly that educators 
everywhere will realize the importance of giving 
our boys and girls that fourfold development 
which they are entitled to have, namely, intel- 
lectual, physical, spiritual, and social develop- 
ment. There can be no doubt that the extra- 
curricular activities contribute more to the 
spiritual and social development of the high

school student than any other phase of the high 
school program. 
The purpose of this volume is to place before 
the reader some underlying principles involved, 
with a few illustrations suggestive of possibili- 
ties in the extra-curricular field, rather than to 
give detailed practices obtaining throughout the 
country. 
High school principals and teachers will find 
the book practical and workable because the 
suggestions have arisen out of actual school 
situations. 
Grateful acknowledgment is due to teachers and 
principals who have provided concrete material 
covering actual school practices and to Dr. 
William M. Davidson, Superintendent of the 
Pittsburgh Schools, for inspiration given to the 
author in his experimental efforts as a high school 
principal. 
The writer wishes to make special acknowledg- 
ment to the Bureau of Education for bulletin 
material quoted and to Dr. Thomas Briggs and 
Dr. E. K. Fretwell, of Columbia University, for 
suggestions which have been used. It is im- 
possible to express appreciation to many others 
who have contributed indirectly to the content 
of this book.

    INTRODUCTORY NOTE 
Extra-curricular activities have come to have a 
prominent place in the development of a complete 
secondary program. 
The author of this volume, Mr. Charles R. 
Foster, Associate Superintendent of the Pitts- 
burgh Public Schools, has tried out, as a high 
school principal, many of the ideas suggested in 
the book under actual school situations. In the 
last two years he has had opportunity to observe 
a still larger field as Associate Superintendent 
of Schools in charge of Junior and Junior-Senior 
High Schools of Pittsburgh, and also as Director 
of the Professional Reading and Study Work for 
all of the teaching staff of the city. 
The author does not claim the last word in the 
suggestions which he offers in his book, but hopes 
' that the volume will stimulate further experimen- 
tation in this field. 
I commend this volume to the consideration of 
High School Principals and Teachers and to Pro- 
fessors of Secondary Administration in Schools 
of Education, Teachers Colleges, and Normal 
Schools.

CHAPTER I 
EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
History of the Movement. Hxtra-curricular_ac- 
tivities are those legitimate activities not pro- 
vided for in that part of the school program 
which is usually designated as the curriculum. 
They are sometimes referred to as semi-curric- 
ular or intra-curricular activities. 
They have gained recognition among educa- 
tors as a vital part of every high school pro- 
gram intended to train our boys and girls to 
take their places in the democracy of the world. 
Their place in that program is the result of 
a changed viewnoini/as to what the aim of the 
school should be. YTheré was a time not far 
distant when the entire aim of the school was 
to develop the intellect to tts highest powers, 
regardless of the social or évén~thepiysical 
needs of the individual. There might have 
been some justification for this situation in the 
fact thatthe population of our country was so 
scattered during the early years of public 
school growth that many of the social attrac- 
1

tions of our time were unknown. Secondary 
schools were attended only by the select few 
  who were he learned pro- 
fess ons. As in practically every field of human 
activity, so chan; incident_ to ing 
of the industrial era wrought their transforma- 
tiofisin the classroom, The greater opportunity 
of the period extended the select group until it 
lifted to a 1c oo in the day of orgai = sa 
one 
The physical needs of the children were once 
cared for by thé work of the farm and the 
essentially outdoor life of a rural and pioneer 
means of insuring health and vigor took the place 
of natural advantages. 
All of these evolutionary changes in ete 
ar, 
    were V! reat World 
And with the war came a realization, as never 
before, of the great importance of education in 
attention of the world as the light of hapa. to which civilization must look if hard-earned ad- 
vances_in democracy are to endure. cen ettnarannaceeRenenS 
The American. high school appeared as the 
outstandiig agen agent of this new and vital educa-

tion. Its growth was phenomenal. In the short 
span of thirty years its enrollment increased five- 
fold, with the American people building-new high 
school buildings at the rate of one-a-day-every” 
day in the thirty years. Since 1890 the high school 
enrollment has increased 710 per cent; the popu- 
lation, 68 per cent. The number of high school 
graduates jumped from 22,000 in 1890 to 250,000 
in 1924. At the present time there are approxi- 
mately 2,000,000 students in the secondary schools 
of the United States. 
With this phenomenal growth came a broaden- 
ing. f purpose-a-“more varied curriculum. a 
more eoemopoltan body ot students, and a mani- 
fest tendency on the part of the students to 
imitate the To of the eomaianity Ti Wwhtch yin they 
found themselves. One of the marked expres- 
sions of the new spirit was the coming of athtetics 
inte-prominence. 
-—Phese changes brought school people every- 
where slowly but surely to a realization of the 
social needs of our high school program. 
Underlying Principles. It is well to keepin mind 
in connection with a discussion of this subject 
some of the underlying principles of thought 
which have influenced the development of the 
extra-curricular program. The_first of. these 
principles is a recognition of individual differ- nance ee A 
         
 
-P-A-G-E-22
    4 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
ences in children and of the need of a program 
to meet their needs. Children differ in ability, 
aptitude, sex, probable career (educational and 
vocational), social status, environment, tradi- 
tions, habits of work, race, nationality, age, 
health, intellectual development, economic status, 
moral atmosphere, and in numerous other ways 
such as to make it imperative that our secondary 
schools provide not only a differentiated curricu- 
lum, departmentalization, homogeneous group- 
ing, promotion by subject, and vocational and 
educational guidance; but also such forms of. 
extra-curricular activities as may utilize the 
social instinct and the socializing, integrating 
factors important in establishing a common basis 
of feelings, aspirations, and ideals essential in 
a democracy. 
A second underlying principle is found in that 
simple statement of fact which is almost axio- 
matic, namely, the best preparation for life is 
living, and the best training for citizenship in 
a democracy is citizenship in a democracy. If 
this be true, both curricular and extra-curricular 
activities should be such that they approach and 
possibly reach life situations. The school ought 
to be organized as a social community working 
on a body of facts as a basis for social action, 
training the members in desirable attitudes and  
-P-A-G-E-23
  EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 5 
dispositions. All of its resources should be 
utilized to realize the social mission of education. 
The school cannot be a preparation for social 
life unless it reproduces within itself the condi- 
tions of social life. Education progressing in a 
school organized as a social laboratory is not 
merely a preparation for citizenship; it is train- 
ing in citizenship. 
Equalization of opportunity, a democratic ideal, 
is the third underlying principle. Dr. Briggs 
tells us that “the one place where democratic 
i tives may function in a natural. 
matrix is in theconduct_of the extra-curricular 
activities. Whether a student is notably dull, 
studious, clever, rich, poor, handsome, or ugly 
he should have an equal opportunity to be a 
member of a school organization which ought 
under all circumstances to be organized upon a 
basis_ of democratic society.”’ : 
A fourth underlying principle recognizes that 
extra-curricular activities are educative only 
when they develop qualities that make for a com- 
plete citizenship, notably leadership, initiative, 
codperation and intelligent obedience to author- 
ity. A broad program of extra-curricular activi— 
ties affords a splendid opportunity to develop a 
diversified and balanced leadership, as well as 
these other qualities. Every good citizen pos-

sesses them to some degree, and it is of primary 
importance that all educational agencies enable 
students to practice them with satisfaction. It 
may be done through the content of the curricu- 
lum, the method of teaching, and especially by 
the participation of the student in the extra- 
eurricular life of the school. 
Instead of frowning, as in older days, upon the 
desire of the young to act upon their own initia- 
tive, we have learned that only upon these varied 
interests can be laid the surest basis for healthy 
growth. Self-reliance, honesty, perseverance, 
and respect for the rights of others are needed. 
The school democracy must be animated by the 
spirit of codperation, the spirit of freely work- 
ing together for the positive good of the whole. 
Initiative is encouraged in order that better 
contributions may be made to the common task. 
Students will be trained to give intelligent obedi- 
ence to authority when they learn from experi- 
ence that their best. interest is sought by the 
law of the school, and when their social con- 
sciousness is enlisted to help frame and enforce 
the regulations under which they are to live. In 
a democracy rules must be obeyed, but the rules 
are not decreed by an autocrat; they are willed 
by the group itself. Responsibility for success 
or failure in the execution of orders rests not
-P-A-G-E-25
  EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES a 
only with those who obey, but also with those 
who help to make them. 
The fifth underlying principle is the one given 
by Dr. Briggs in his work The Junior High 
School: 
It is the business of the teacher to teach the pupil to do 
better the desirable things he will do anyway; to reveal 
higher types of activity; to make these desired and to 
an extent possible. 
These simply stated principles are far reach: 
ing in their effects. Their acceptance obliges 
one to make an inventory of the desirable ac- 
tivities pursued by boys sand girls i in. school, with 
reference to the charac characters they are most likely 
to develop as s_men_and women. These activities 
apply to the entire secondary school program, 
both curricular and extra-curricular. 
Extra-curricular activities are found to_ offer 
the “school 1 its best. opportunity to to_help students 
do certain desirable things they are going to do 
anyway as ‘they t: take their places as members of 
social units, and to exercise those qualities of 
citizenship _ which are_ fundamental to society. 
Tn these activities, too, there is a ready channel 
through which the school may utilize the spon- 
taneous interests and activities of the adolescent, 
and through these lead to higher types of activi- 
ties both desired and possible of attainment.   
  
 
-P-A-G-E-26
8 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
In the sixth underlying principle there is 
almost general agreement. Hxtra-curricular ac- 
tivities should have their foundations, in most 
instances, in the curricular activities and should 
help to motivate them. In a recent report to 
the National Education Association, a  sub- 
committee of which the writer was a member 
laid emphasis on this principle. In addition, the 
committee reported as follows: 
The final objective of the Junior High School program 
of studies must be to provide socialization on a scale so 
extensive that adolescent youth may find in the school it- 
self the special field for their activities as [junior] citi- 
zens. It is vital to recognize that the organized activities 
of school socialization should be and are motivated by ac- 
cepted educational objectives to an extent equal to the 
motivation of the subjects of study by such objectives. 
When this recognition is once given, school activities will 
be dignified by a place in the program of studies and by 
a definite time allotment consistent with their rich educa- 
tional possibilities. They must be as definitely planned as 
any other administrative or instructional facilities for the 
attainment of the objectives of secondary education. They 
should become integral parts of the program of studies. 
They deserve a higher recognition than that accorded by 
the designation extra-curricular. They are intra-curricu- 
lar activities. 
The seventh underlying principle, that extra- 
curricular activities have a distinct moral value, 
is suggested in The Journal of the National 
Education Association for 1922:
-P-A-G-E-27
  EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 9 
Our standards are not something remote from experi- 
ence but are engendered by experience itself. Moral 
training cannot be inculeated by giving children a set of 
maxims; it must be gained by the give and take of social 
life itself. To provide a child with a set of maxims is 
to bind him an unthinking slave to the past; to give him 
the power to realize the moral implications of his own 
conduct and to evolve a code of ethics for evaluating social 
experience, from the experience in which he is himself en- 
gaging, is to make him an active agent of civilization. 
It is for this reason that activities in school are a funda- 
mental necessity in guiding conduct. They give oppor- 
tunity for situations that bring about moral training 
through experience itself. A school régime that encourages 
the passive absorption of knowledge for its own sake, that 
isolates pupils into individual units and emphasizes com- 
petition, that makes communication among pupils a sin, 
is training its pupils in a code of ethics which is not in 
accordance with what is advocated in life outside of school, 
and it fails to take advantage of the two great oppor- 
tunities for moral training of life in a social group—the 
training in codperation and social sympathy. 
The experience of a pupil in the company of his fellows 
is the best moral training he can have. Social disapproval 
has a quick and direct way of reforming conduct that is 
worth a dozen homilies or moral lessons. Moral character 
is developed through formation of habits, through ex- 
perience. Moral preference is exercised only in making a 
choice. It is only when there is a freedom to act, to act 
wrongly or rightly, that any moral issue is involved. Other- 
wise the intelligence has no opportunity to discern right 
from wrong; the disposition to do right has no chance to 
function positively. We cannot develop in children a sense 
of responsibility to act rightly when we deny them free- 
dom of choiee as to their actions.
-P-A-G-E-28
  10 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
In Bulletin No. 51 (1917) ‘‘Moral Values in 
Education,’’ published by the Bureau of Educa- 
tion, we have the following statement which sums 
up the whole argument for activities as moral 
agencies: 
First in importance as a moral agency should be placed 
the actual performance of the pupils themselves. It is 
one thing to hear right conduct praised or see it exem- 
plified; it is quite another and more necessary thing for 
the boys and girls themselves to do the acts. 
Character is essentially a matter of action, the habitual 
performance of certain kinds of deeds rather than others; 
and the only genuine way of learning how to do these 
deeds is to do them, just as tennis is learned only by play- 
ing it. 
The better schools of our time have seized upon the 
fact that pupils take to activity so much more readily 
than they do to the relatively passive business of listen- 
ing or reading. They are eager to engage in athletics, 
to run a school paper, to dance, to act plays, to build, to 
do dozens of things that merely sitting at a desk studying 
and reciting will never permit. 
Other underlying principles briefly stated are 
as follows: Where the pupils are free to organ- 
ize and carry on their own activities, everything 
is done under the urge of strong motives. By 
means of common interests, group experiences, 
ified feeling, both individual development 
and democratic ai be achieved. The 
organization of the secondary school must pro- 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
  EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 11 
vide its adolescents with so much good to be done 
that the bad will have no place. 
Extra-curricular activities must be suited to 
the age of the students. Many of the activities 
that are well suited to the students of the early 
adolescent years will not appeal to them later on. 
Opportunities must be provided for conscious 
choice, in accordance with intensive interest. 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  CHAPTER II 
ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION OF 
EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
Extra-curricular Director or Teacher. The suc- 
.cess_of the extra-curricular program depends 
largely upon the wisdom, foresight, sympathy, 
and enthusiasm of the the principal and those dele- 
gated by him to carry it out. High school prin- 
cipals, except in very small schools, need the 
    nea 
catrying out an extra-curricular program as 
outlined in this book, In the city of Pittsburgh, 
each junior, ; junior-senior, and senior high school 
is assigned an extra teacher designated by the 
title ‘‘Extra-curricular Teacher.’’ 
She may be assigned to full-time supervision 
of the extra-curricular work, or the time 
allotted to this extra teacher may be so dis- 
tributed that several teachers may have free 
time for this purpose. Under this plan sev- 
eral activities may receive the attention of 
one teacher for one half of every day: club 
activities, school assemblies, social programs. 
12 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  
ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 13 
Another teacher devotes one half of her time 
to student government in all its phases. 
In another high school this time is divided 
among four faculty members. 
Teachers or administrators who have charge 
of this work should be selected with great care. 
They need to have a clear-cut conception of the 
place of extra-curricular activities in a modern 
school program. The importance of the position 
is such that one to occupy it should possess tact, 
ability, vision, engaging personality, and en- 
thusiasm. Every high school ought to have an 
activities, committee appointed by the principal 
to handle all problems connected with the activi- 
ties of the school. The recommendations of this 
committee should be subject to the principal’s 
approval. 
Activities Period. The extra-curricular pro- 
gram is so important that a regular period each 
day should be set aside to promote it. Such a 
period is usually designated the ‘‘activities 
period.’’ It always results in a much better spirit 
of codperation on the part of both pupils and 
teachers. It gives dignity and recognition to the 
extra-curricular program in a manner impos- 
sible when this work is attempted after school 
hours. Moreover, it prevents the program from 
interfering with the after-school plans of parents,
-P-A-G-E-32
  14 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
employers, and others, leaving free the time 
which should be used for athletic events or 
various features which might more profitably 
take place after regular school hours. Teachers 
are more likely to be interested if this plan is 
followed, and it encourages them to volunteer 
sponsorship relations. 
The activities period must be a real activities 
period, with a rich extra-curricular program, 
or it develops into a mere loafing period. The 
following program is carried out in the activities 
periods of a week in the high schools of Pitts- 
burgh and is suggestive of what may be done in 
this field:

and guidance period permits the home-room or 
report-class teacher to come into intimate con- 
tact with the individual members of her report 
class. It affords her an opportunity for check- 
ing their scholarship, attendance, and interests, 
especially valuable in following through a good 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 15 
guidance program. This guidance program is 
accomplished through regular guidance instruc- 
tion and the organization of Life Career Clubs, 
especially for students in the junior high school 
grades. 
Life Career Clubs, where organized, have been 
conducted as a part of the guidance program of 
the school and have been unusually successful. 
Instructional material for them has been care- 
fully worked out and forms the basis for real 
work for these Monday activities periods.* 
Home-Room Meetings. The home-room meet- 
ing is held each Tuesday during the activities 
period. The meeting is the heart of the entire 
program, for it reaches all students in the school. 
It is the time when every vital question dealing 
with the welfare of the institution is democrati- 
cally discussed. The home-room representative 
on the student council brings back for discussion 
the recommendations of that organization, fol- 
lowed by rejection or adoption. The home-room 
organization can initiate school policies and rec- 
ommendations which may be sent through repre- 
sentatives to the student council for consideration 
by that body. There is an almost inexhaustible 
supply of topics affording profitable discussion 
by the students in the home-room period. The

of every student. Committees of teachers and 
students worked out these outlines together. 
The following program is an example of what 
was done in this connection:

d. Defacement of building; care of books and other

e. Conduct in assembly: politeness to speaker; courtesy

The home room is organized with its own 
officers. These students preside at all meetings. 
The teacher, although in the background, func- 
tions as the guiding spirit and inspiration of the 
group. Parliamentary procedure should be used 
invariably in order that the students may have 
that practice and experience likely to prove in- 
valuable later on in life. 
Club Activities. The Wednesday activities pe- 
riod is set aside for the meetings of the numer- 
ous clubs. The ultimate ideal of each school 
should be the enlistment of its entire enrollment 
from conscious choice, based on interest in some 
club activity of the school. The difficulty of 
doing this must not be underestimated. Club 
motives, club sponsorship, and club organiza- 
tion are problems not always simple of solution. 
But the ideal of every student in a worth-while 
club is an ideal which is worthy and which 
is possible of attainment. It has already been 
accomplished in some junior high schools in 
America.

Sponsorship. Hach club should be sponsored 
properly by a member of the faculty. Sponsors 
should be appointed by the principal, who should 
take into account their qualifications for the 
assignment. It is not good policy for the prin- 
cipal to appoint sponsors indiscriminately. As 
a rule, teachers who volunteer for sponsorship 
of clubs are more likely to be successful. Stu- 
dents frequently make good suggestions for 
sponsors of clubs, but it is not always safe to 
follow their suggestions. Popular teachers do 
not always make good sponsors. 
Teachers are rapidly dispelling the old-time 
idea that they should confine their interests to 
mathematics, science, English, or whatever hap- 
pens to be their field. They are finding out that 
their sphere of influence is not confined to the 
four walls of their individual classrooms.
-P-A-G-E-40
    22 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
The writer was gratified beyond measure in 
developing an extra-curricular program through 
four years of experience as a high school prin- 
cipal to find how gladly teachers would volunteer 
their services for these activities as soon as they 
actually caught the vision of the enlarged oppor- 
tunity thus opened to the boys and girls. The 
sponsors should, of course, attend all club meet- 
ings and hold themselves constantly in readi- 
ness to serve. 
Guidance. Provision must be made for wise 
guidance. Students ought not to be permitted 
to enter upon any activity unless they display 
an evident enthusiasm for the activity and an 
interest in the organization. There should be 
particular requirements (democratic, of course) 
for admission to any club. The educational 
guidance program falls short of its purpose 
unless it leads students into activities suited to 
their tastes, interests, and needs. It should be 
a stimulating influence to the pupil who appears 
to lack interest in school activities. Round pegs 
in round holes are necessary if any activity is 
to succeed. 
Club Membership Requirements. Every club 
should have its own constitution and by-laws. 
Requirements for admission are determined by 
the purpose of the club and the nature of its
-P-A-G-E-41
  
  ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 23 
work. Under no circumstances should members 
be admitted to a club by a vote of the students 
through a process of blackballing or balloting. 
In such organizations as orchestras, glee clubs, 
dramatic organizations, and debating clubs it is 
necessary to admit members through a try-out 
process. After the students have become mem- 
bers of clubs, they should be checked to deter- 
mine whether or not they are being useful to 
the organization. If they have no interest and 
fail to meet the requirements of the club, they 
should be dropped from membership. 
How Organized. Clubs are organized upon the 
request of students or upon the suggestion of 
a teacher who volunteers sponsorship. The 
objectives of the club should be clearly stated, 
and it should be evident that they spring from 
a real, live interest on the part of those asking 
for the organization. Experience has shown 
that some of the best high school clubs ever 
organized came about as the result of requests 
on the part of the students themselves. Before 
clubs are accepted as a part of the approved 
activity program, they should be considered 
carefully by the extra-curricular directors, the 
faculty committee, and the principal. Before 
and after the organization, the principal or his 
Assistant should keep in close touch with these
-P-A-G-E-42
  24 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
club organizations in order that he may be sure 
they have worthy objectives, conform to school 
policy, and do not duplicate efforts of a similar 
nature elsewhere in the school. With this in- 
formation, the principal may diplomatically dis- 
courage undesirable activities and point the way 
to better ones. 
General Principles. Students should be aided in 
keeping a proper balance between their extra- 
curricular activities and their curricular activi- 
ties. The number of clubs to which they are 
permitted to belong ought to be limited. In 
Pittsburgh high schools, two extra-curricular 
activities only are allowed. That students who 
sever their relationship with the school should 
be automatically dropped from membership in 
all regular school activities is understood. 
All money handled by extra-curricular organ- 
izations should pass through a centralized 
treasury or a centralized auditing and account- 
ing committee. Business-like methods only 
should be considered. The following plan in use 
in one high school is simple and meets the re- 
quirements of good business sense: 
All money from the high school organizations 
is deposited with the school treasurer (in this 
case a member of the commercial department 
of the faculty) as soon as it is acquired by any
-P-A-G-E-43
ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 25 
class, club, organization treasurer, or financial 
agent. The treasurer pays all bills incurred by 
these organizations when ordered on signature 
of the president and sponsor. Day by day he 
deposits his receipts in a local bank. 
The school treasurer keeps the funds of each 
organization in a separate account and can give 
information in a moment’s time with regard to 
the balance any organization may have in its 
treasury. There is no overlapping of funds, no 
misappropriation. The funds of each organiza- 
tion may be expended only by order of and in 
the interests of that organization. For example, 
funds held for the athletic association are never 
devoted to any other interest, such as the library 
or school paper, unless such diversion of money 
is distinctly authorized. 
The treasurer submits a complete report to 
the principal at the close of each semester, in 
addition to a report rendered by the auditing 
committee on the condition of the books. The 
treasurer is an officer under bond. In view of 
the fact that sums ranging in amount from a few 
cents to more than ten thousand dollars pass 
through the treasurer’s hands, the necessity for 
a business-like system is perfectly obvious. 
The School Assembly. One activities period each 
week is devoted to the school assembly. In some
-P-A-G-E-44
  26 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
schools two periods a week are used for this 
purpose. When the student body is divided for 
purposes of assembly, the group not partici- 
pating therein is afforded another chance for 
club activities or other student endeavors. A 
more detailed discussion of the assembly will be 
given in a later chapter.

CHAPTER III 
DESCRIPTION OF TYPICAL CLUBS 
In this chapter a number of clubs are de- 
scribed in detail as examples of the possibilities 
in the field of extra-curricular activities. There 
are, of course, other clubs equally worthy of 
a place in the program. The ones mentioned 
- are all functioning in high schools at the present 
time. 
The Senior History Club. The Senior History 
Club takes charge of all special day programs 
in the senior assembly. This club functions more 
widely than any other organized club in the 
school. Its program for a part of the school 
year is here shown:

The Athletic Club. This club is open to senior 
high school boys only. Its membership com- 
prises the teams or squads in the current 
athletic sports participated in by the senior boys 
of the school. In the fall it is the football squad, 
in the winter the basket-ball and gymnastic 
teams, and in the spring the baseball and track 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
30 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
teams. There are usually about forty-five boys 
in the club. It is sponsored by the senior coach 
who gives the members talks on games, sport, 
and sportmanship; gives blackboard drills; 
analyzes the games just played and points for- 
ward to the games yet to be played; gives talks 
on clean living; and brings in prominent athletes 
from local colleges and universities to talk to 
the boys on all phases of the sport which is 
their interest. In Pittsburgh some of the speakers 
have been members of the University of Pitts- 
burgh football team, the sporting editor of one of 
the papers, Honus Wagner, famous baseball 
player, and Dr. Homer Flint, basket-ball specialist. 
High ideals of sportsmanship are always stressed 
in the meetings of the Athletic Club. 
The Puzzle Club. This club is open to any in- 
terested student. The ‘‘puzzle instinct’’ is very 
strong in many young people. They derive much 
pleasure and much good from puzzle solving. 
The aim of the club is in direct line with the 
‘‘worthy use of leisure.’’ The history or stories 
of the world’s most celebrated puzzles are re- 
lated in its meetings, and the time is devoted to 
the solution of puzzles brought in by the club 
members or gleaned from the pages of magazines 
and newspapers. If the puzzles are not solved  
-P-A-G-E-49
DESCRIPTION OF TYPICAL CLUBS 31 
in the meeting periods, they are taken home, 
worked out, and reported on by the members. 
On account of the current interest in cross-word 
puzzles, they have been added. Contests are a 
feature of the work of this club. Its purpose is 
wholesome mental recreation. That there was 
a genuine interest in its activities was shown by 
the fact that during the past year seventy-six 
students in a certain school placed this club as 
their first choice of the school activities. The 
Puzzle Club is included in the chapter to illus- 
trate the fact that there is a place in the well- 
rounded extra-curricular program not only for 
educational clubs, but also for recreational clubs. 
The Travel Club. This club is open to junior 
high school students, and serves as a supplement 
to the regular geography classes. Imaginary 
trips by land and water are taken during the 
meetings, with frequent use of the stereoptican 
and motion-picture machine, as well as of pictures 
brought in by the students. The students tell about 
their own trips. The field of activity for such a 
club is wide, as wide as the earth itself, and par- 
ticipation may be made very profitable to the 
younger students of the junior high school group. 
The ‘‘ Travelers Club’’ of one high school has out- 
lined a trip around the world for its year’s work.
-P-A-G-E-50
  32 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
With Pittsburgh as a starting point, the club 
members have already reached Chicago, Yellow- 
stone Park, the Canadian Rockies, and the 
Pacific Northwest. Thence the route calls for a 
visit to Alaska. This traveling is done by means 
of slides, motion pictures, and photographs. 
Each week seven or eight members are assigned 
topics dealing with the place to be visited. These 
reports are then read and discussed in class. 
The club is extremely popular. 
The National Honor Society. The National Hon- 
or Society of Secondary Schools is a national 
society with local chapters in the senior high 
schools of the country. Its purpose, according 
to its constitution, is ‘‘to create an enthusiasm 
for scholarship, to stimulate a desire to render 
service, to promote leadership, and to develop 
character in the students of the American 
secondary schools.’’ The general control of the 
organization is vested in a National Council. 
A chapter, before its admission to the National 
Honor Society, must have its organization ap- 
proved by the National Council. An appropri- 
ate emblem, uniform throughout the country, is 
used by each chapter. Besides possessing quali- 
ties of scholarship, service, leadership, and char- 
acter, a candidate for membership must rank
-P-A-G-E-51
a aa a tina: 
DESCRIPTION OF TYPICAL CLUBS 33 
in the upper fourth of his class, and must have 
been a member of the school for at least one 
| year. Selection of members is made by the 
faculty or by the principal with the aid of a 
committee of faculty members. There should 
be a place for this organization or its parallel 
in every senior high school.* 
The Health Club. The Health Club, sponsored 
by two physical training teachers, one man and 
one woman, meets in the regular activities period. 
Its membership is composed of the associate 
representatives of each report room. The presi- 
dent is the vice president of the student council. 
Through its form of organization, it closely 
touches the entire student body. The objectives 
of the club are to improve the general health of 
the student body, to keep the school building 
sanitary and clean, and to awaken students to 
the value of regular personal health habits and 
clean living. 
Its activities consist of the discussion of health 
topics and suggestions as to the improvement of 
health conditions in the school and outside of the 
school. The subjects of proper ventilation, tem- 
perature, correct lighting, and sanitation of class 
and wash rooms are discussed, together with such 
1Complete information may be obtained from the national secretary, Mr. 
H. V. Church, Cicero, Illinois.  
-P-A-G-E-52
  34 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
topics as proper food, clothing, bathing, personal 
habits, safety, and first aid. The club keeps in 
close touch with organizations like the American 
Child Health Association, Modern Health Cru- 
saders, the Junior Red Cross, the American 
Child Hygiene Association, and the National 
Dairy Council. Its work is of such extent that it 
may be carried on into the senior high school 
grades. 
The Girl Reserves Club. This club, under the 
auspices of the Young Women’s Christian Asso- 
ciation, is to the girls of the school what the 
‘“‘Hi-Y’’ Club is to the boys. In the local high 
school it is sponsored by faculty members who 
have a vital interest in girls of the ‘‘teen’’ age 
It meets regularly in the activities period. “€irls 
of the eighth and ninth grades are eligible. The 
purpose of the organization is to unite the mem- 
bers in a spirit of friendliness and service, to 
win other girls to membership, and to stand 
for the best things at home, at school, at work, 
in the church, and in the community. Meetings 
are in charge of committees of girls who work 
under the direction of sponsors. The activities 
consist of discussions; social functions, such as 
music, games and parties; business meetings; 
and social service. The following program was

The “Hi-Y” Club. The ‘‘Hi-Y’’ Club is a func- 
tioning organization in many American junior 
and senior high schools, backed by the Young 
Men’s Christian Association. In Pennsylvania 
it has become a state-wide activity, and annual 
conferences of large subdivisions of the state are 
held in various cities, with the local clubs send- 
ing delegations to these meetings. The ‘‘Hi-Y’’
-P-A-G-E-56

Club is an organization formed to promote the 
ideals of the Young’s Men’s Christian Associa- 
tion among the boys of high school age. Its mem- 
bership is open to every boy who displays an 
interest in its purpose. 
As expressed in most of the declarations of 
purpose of ‘‘Hi-Y’’ Clubs in Pennsylvania, the 
aims of the movement are primarily to introduce 
and maintain ideals of clean speech, clean sports- 
manship, clean scholarship, and clean living in 
the high school. This purpose is accomplished 
through an active program mapped out to cover 
the school year. Weekly meetings are held, 
usually at the supper hour, the boys gathering 
after school for social recreation until 5:30 
or 6 o’clock, and then taking dinner together, 
usually in the Young Men’s Christian Associa- 
tion. In most cases, this dinner is served at a 
very low rate, in the hope that no boys need feel 
any necessity for remaining outside the club on 
account of the cost. Following the dinner, the 
club, under the direction of its president, enjoys 
a number of songs or cheers for a few minutes. 
This part of the program bears a distinct flavor 
of ‘school spirit.’’ In fact, it is one of the aims 
of the organization to develop the right kind of 
‘“‘school spirit,’’? diffusing a wholesome en- 
thusiasm throughout the entire student body.
-P-A-G-E-57
  DESCRIPTION OF TYPICAL CLUBS 39 
After the songs, an outside speaker who knows 
how to talk to boys, be he business man, ‘‘Y’’ 
leader, college athlete, or preacher, is allowed 
fifteen or twenty minutes for the talk of the 
evening. Following this address, the boys ad- 
journ. Numerous Bible Study classes are 
organized, and the students are urged to take 
part in these groups, which meet after the regu- 
lar program. The entire meeting is closed in 
ample time for the boys to return to their homes 
before the evening is far advanced. 
The motives of the ‘‘Hi-Y’’ Club are well 
illustrated by the following ‘‘Declaration of 
Purpose’’: 
As a “Hi-Y” Club member, I declare it to be my 
purpose: 
1. To be faithful in attendance at club meetings. 
2. To uphold the four planks of the “Hi-Y” platform: 
Clean Speech, Clean Sportsmanship, Clean Scholarship, 
Clean Living. 
3. To carry the Torch of Service wherever I go. 
4. In all ways and at all times to seek by my inward 
life and outward conduct—and through codperative efforts 
with others—to create, maintain, and extend high stand- 
ards of Christian character throughout the high school 
and the community in which I live. 
The application for membership in a certain 
high school ‘‘Hi-Y’’ Club states its purpose as 
follows:  
-P-A-G-E-58
  40 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
I hereby declare that if accepted as a member, I will 
be faithful in attendance at the club meetings and will 
seek by my inward life and outward conduct (and 
through codperative efforts with others) to ereate, main- 
tain, and extend high standards of Christian character 
throughout our high school and the community in ‘which 
I live. 
Each year the ‘‘Hi-Y’’ Club is instrumental 
in conducting a ‘‘Mur’’ week in the high school or 
junior high school. This week is dedicated to 
‘““Mour,’’ or, ‘‘Move Up Forward.’’ Its aim is to 
give each boy in the school who will signify his 
willingness to codperate a fifteen-minute (or 
longer) conference with some local business man 
of recognized standing, on any problem, moral 
or social, which the boy would like to discuss con- 
fidentially with such a person. The interview is 
designed to help the boy to determine his own 
duties, obligations, and conduct. Men are chosen 
for the interviews who may be depended upon 
to say something during the interview which 
will help the boy in some department of his own 
life. The ‘‘Mur’’ program has been successful in 
reaching hundreds of boys in every high school 
in which it has been tried. The students are 
‘‘signed up’’ for conferences largely through the 
efforts of the members of the ‘‘Hi-Y’’ Club. It 
is probably the one outstanding contribution of 
the club to the school each year.

  DESCRIPTION OF TYPICAL CLUBS 41 
The Boy Leaders Club. This club is sponsored 
by the physical training teacher. Its membership 
is limited to boys with a ranking of A in physical 
education. Meetings are held once each week in 
the activity period. Its objective is to develop 
leadership, to create true ‘‘school spirit,’? and 
to serve others. The activities consist of special 
instruction designed to enable the members to 
assist in the direction of gymnasium classes, in 
the refereeing of games, in such special gym- 
nasium work as tumbling and pyramid forming, 
and in the distribution and care of lockers and 
baskets during the games. The aim of the club 
members is to be active as leaders and ‘‘boosters’’ 
in connection with all athletic activities. 
The Science Club. The Science Club is spon- 
sored by science teachers. It is open to students 
in the ninth grade and has the following 
objectives: 
1. To encourage general scientific knowledge. 
2. To have every member take part in the 
meetings. 
3. To encourage students to present scientific 
ideas or information in which they are 
especially interested. 
4. To stimulate keener interest in the work 
of the regular science classes.  
-P-A-G-E-60
    42 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
5. To help the students do better the things 
they will do anyway. 
6. To create an enthusiasm for scientific learn- 
ing among students and by students. 
7. To develop initiative, self-reliance, and 
leadership in this field. 
8. To appreciate the importance of science in 
the everyday life of every citizen. 
The club activities consist mainly in discus- 
sions of scientific topics; reviews of current 
science; announcements of inventions, discover- 
ies, and practices; and the use of scientific infor- 
mation found in magazines, newspapers, and 
scientific literature. Stereoptican slides and 
motion pictures giving interesting educational 
scientific information are widely used in the work 
of this club. 
In addition to the usual club officers, this club 
has an officer known as a magazine buyer, whose 
duty it is to purchase, with money obtained for 
the purpose through a small assessment upon 
each member, the latest magazines on science 
as soon as they are published. <A sergeant at 
arms sees that the magazines are kept in order, 
operates the stereoptican machine, attends to 
the window shades, and preserves order. A club

club and its activities in the school paper, and 
criticizes the English of the speakers. It is a 
successful club and usually attracts large num- 
bers of students in the ninth grade. 
The Valet Club. The Valet Club is sponsored 
by the teacher of household economy, and also 
meets weekly in the activities period. Member- 
ship is limited to twenty-five boys. The club 
objectives are as follows: 
1. To encourage boys to take pride in per- 
sonal neatness and appearance.

The Pen and Ink Club. This club is organized 
as an aid to the publication of the school paper. 
Its purpose is to give elementary instruction in 
journalism and to create and maintain school 
interest and enthusiasm for the school paper. 
Its membership is composed of the staff of the 
paper, editors, reporters, copy readers, and any 
students who manifest a particular interest in 
this form of activity. The club maintains a 
high scholarship requirement for membership. 
Only those who maintain a grade of B (or bet- 
ter) are permitted to belong to the club. 
It meets regularly each week in the activities 
period. Its activities consist mainly in support- 
ing and planning the school paper; review- 
ing, correcting, censoring, and writing articles; 
discussing the policy and needs of the paper; 
preparing and planning the copy; and in taking 
eare of details of every kind connected with its 
publication. Exchange papers from other insti- 
tutions are studied, discussed, and read in the 
meetings. 
The Journalistic Club. The purpose of the 
Journalistic Club is to encourage students who 
possess latent talent in the various phases of 
journalism to develop such talent. Reporters 
are appointed to cover all the activities of the 
school. A reporter is given a reporter’s card
-P-A-G-E-63
  DESCRIPTION OF TYPICAL CLUBS 45 
which admits him to the meeting to which he 
has been assigned. The reports are discussed 
in club meetings and, when corrected, are used 
for newspaper columns publishing the activities 
of the schools. The reporters eagerly watch 
these columns to see how much space has been 
given to their assignments. 
Some members of the club write special ar- 
ticles for the monthly school paper or for the 
school annual. Others write poetry, draw car- 
toons, or make posters and illustrations for the 
club. Meetings are held weekly during the ac- 
tivity period. There is a short business meet- 
ing which gives practice in parliamentary law. 
Writers on local newspapers and others are in- 
vited to address the club. 
A grade of B (or higher) in English is re- 
quired of those elected to hold office in the club. 
The grade is required not only for the excel- 
lence it indicates in the field of English but also 
for the general ability it indicates on the part 
of the student as one qualified to carry on the 
duties of a club officer in addition to his class- 
room work. Membership in the club includes 
students above the grade of 9B. Dues amount- 
ing to twenty-five cents each semester are 
charged for the purpose of paying the transpor-

tation of outside speakers and subscribing to 
magazines on journalism. 
Foreign Language Clubs. Students who are 
studying any of three languages, French, Span- 
ish, or German, are eligible to membership in 
these clubs. Language teachers serve as spon- 
sors. The clubs meet once each week in the 
regular activities period. 
The purpose of these clubs is to create in- 
terest in a particular language and to afford an 
opportunity to use the language under the urge 
of a strong motive. The activities consist of a 
study of the life, characteristics, and customs 
of the people of the foreign country; informal 
conversation in the foreign language; prepara- 
tion and execution of songs, games, and play- 
lets; telling stories; and in living, writing, and 
speaking in terms of the language the students 
of the club are trying to learn. Such clubs 
should be required to direct part of their efforts 
toward preparing programs for the assemblies. 
Programs of this kind are invariably enjoyed 
by the student body. 
Boys’ and Girls’ Glee Clubs. When the school is 
large enough to maintain two separate organiza- 
tions, it should have a Boys’ Glee Club and a 
Girls’ Glee Club. There is an individuality of 
organization in separate: glee clubs which is not
-P-A-G-E-65
  DESCRIPTION OF TYPICAL CLUBS 47 
possible in a mixed glee club. Furthermore, the 
separation affords a chance for healthy rivalry. 
Membership in these organizations may range 
from twenty or thirty to more than one hundred. 
It should be determined by the student’s ability 
to sing and his natural interest in such an or- 
ganization. Music teachers usually sponsor 
these clubs, which meet each week in the regu- 
lar activities period. 
It is often advisable to substitute this activity 
for the usually required chorus work and allow 
the students one fourth of a credit for each se- 
mester’s work. The principal activity of these 
clubs is directed toward a study of songs suited 
to male or female voices, with attention to 
tone quality, tempo, phrasing, and every detail 
tending to produce a finished production. Con- 
siderable attention is given to music apprecia- 
tion and to celebrated song writers and their 
songs. Such organizations codperate in the an- 
nual musical entertainment of the school. They 
also constitute dependable sources of entertain- 
ment at times when something is needed for the 
assembly program. 
The Vocational Club. The Vocational Club is 
intended primarily for boys who are not read- 
ily interested in the usual academic, musical, 
cultural, and literary clubs. Membership is by 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
    48 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
invitation of the sponsor, acting on the advice 
of the home-room adviser or the student coun- 
selor. The club meets once each week in the 
regular activities period. Its activities are 
mainly athletic and industrial in character. The 
boys are encouraged to supplement their usual 
shop projects with other things that may be 
made. 
The members are given special assignments to 
the gymnasium and support their own athletic 
teams, competing with the other organizations 
and classes in the school. Anything considered 
a legitimate means of arousing interest and en- 
thusiasm is undertaken by this club. Many 
lethargic, uninterested, time-killing boys have 
developed into good, industrious, loyal students 
through the instrumentality of this club. The 
sponsor should be an industrial teacher with 
some athletic proclivity, possessing, above all, a 
vast amount of sympathy. 
Know Your City Clubs. These clubs were or- 
ganized in the early days of the development of 
the junior high school as a sort of ‘‘filler in.’’ 
They proved useful as activities for seventh- 
grade pupils, in particular. On the suggestion 
that each seventh-grade home room be organ- 
ized as a ‘‘Know Your City Club,’’ with the

home-room teacher as sponsor, the director of 
activities planned a program and the plan was 
placed in effect. As a result of the success at- 
tending the experiment, ‘‘Know Your City 
Clubs’’ have taken their place as a regular part 
of the extra-curricular activities in some high 
schools. The clubs meet, as do the others, in the 
activities period, once each week. 
The purpose of the clubs is to familiarize the 
students with their own city, acquainting them 
with its streets, parks, recreational centers, 
buildings, art galleries, museums, zodlogical and 
botanical gardens, industrial plants, historical 
landmarks, public buildings, church edifices, 
educational institutions, and plans for the fu- 
ture. This purpose is achieved through the 
medium of discussions, talks, excursions, and 
pictures. These clubs are especially adapted to 
the early years of the junior high school, and 
have a high educational value if properly spon- 
sored and directed. 
The Girls’ Athletic Leaders Club. The objectives 
of this club are as follows: 
1. To assist the instructor in physical educa- 
tion in the conduct of the practical phases 
of the physical education program. 
2. To promote among the students the proper
-P-A-G-E-70
50 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
mental attitude toward health and physi- 
eal education. 
3. To teach its members the fundamental im- 
portance of a rich physical foundation in 
any field of human endeavor. 
Membership in the club is confined to girl stu- 
dents in the last three years of the senior high 
school. Any girl who receives the unanimous 
recommendation of her teachers, the approval of 
the membership committee, and who maintains 
a grade of B (or better) in physical education 
and D (or better) in other subjects (only one 
D permitted) throughout the previous semester, 
may be admitted to membership. She must 
maintain this scholarship standing as long as 
she holds membership in the club. 
Meetings are held once each week in the ac- 
tivities period. The members are known by the 
general term ‘‘leader.’’ <A ‘‘leader’’ may be 
suspended or dropped from membership for un- 
becoming conduct or misdemeanors, or for fail- 
ing to meet the scholarship requirements. The 
standard colors for this club may be the city’s 
colors. The department off hygiene furnishes 
insignia for each member according to a stand- 
ard design. One club is organized in each 
school.  
-P-A-G-E-71
  DESCRIPTION OF TYPICAL CLUBS 51 
Each year the members of the club elect three 
outstanding leaders wha are recommended for 
a special medal awarded by the department of 
hygiene. For determining the ‘‘three superior 
leaders’’ a ballot is used on which various qual- 
ities are listed with a maximum number of points 
each, and the student checks the number of 
points to which he believes each candidate is 
entitled. These qualities, for example, may be 
listed as follows: Scholarship, 15 points; Good 
Spirit, 15 points; Executive Ability, 15 points; 
Initiative, 15 points; Neatness, 10 points; Exact- 
ness, 10 points; Responsibility, 10 points; Ath- 
letic Ability, 10 points; Total, 100. With this 
as a scale the student grades his own candidate 
on the ballot. 
The activities of the club are mainly athletic, 
with some social functions. It aims to maintain 
high ideals and qualities of leadership for its 
leaders on the gymnasium floor, throughout the 
school, and even beyond the school. 
The Girls’ Athletic Leaders Clubs of the 
high schools are organized on a city-wide basis 
in an organization which functions ‘through a 
Leaders Club Council composed of five members 
from each club. The council conducts a fall 
rally and a spring rally of all the Leaders Club 
members of the city, and in various ways pro-
-P-A-G-E-72
    52 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
vides for a definite band of union for the indi- 
vidual clubs of the city. These rallies afford an 
opportunity to present honor awards to superior 
leaders. As a wholesome influence in creating 
and maintaining the most desirable kind of school 
spirit, organizations of this kind ought to be 
found in every high school in the country. 
The Boy Scout Club. The objectives of the Boy 
Scout Club are found in the statement of the 
Scout Oath and Scout Law and are as follows: 
1. To do my duty to God and my country and 
obey the Scout Law. 
2. To help each other at all times. 
3. To keep myself physically strong, men- 
tally awake, and morally straight. 
4. To be trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, 
courteous, obedient, thrifty, brave, clean, 
reverent, kind, and cheerful. 
The club is a regularly organized Boy Scout 
Troop composed of boys who are regular mem- 
bers of the school organization. It meets every 
week in the activities period. New members are 
taught the Scout Law and the Scout Craft. 
Games of Scout type are played. The usual 
features of Scout activity, including week-end 
camping and participation in all Scout meets 
for which the boys are eligible, are carried out.
-P-A-G-E-73
  DESCRIPTION OF TYPICAL CLUBS 53 
The members take part in such public functions 
as the Memorial Day parade, the Armistice 
Day parade, assemblies, and parents’ meetings. 
Once each year the Scout ideals are presented 
before the school assembly, and once each se- 
’ mester a meeting of the parents is held. Contests 
are conducted with other Scout organizations in 
which prizes for special attainment are awarded, 
the fields of competition including first aid, sig- 
naling, making fire from friction, tent setting, 
swimming, and ‘‘good turn’’ records. The or- 
ganization has a special appeal to boys of jun- 
ior high school age. It is beyond the experi- 
mental stage and has proved itself worthy of a 
place in the extra-curricular program of every 
junior high school where proper sponsorship 
may be had. In addition to being a regular club 
activity of the school, it is recognized as a reg- 
ular Boy Scout Troop and as such is affiliated 
with the regular Boy Scout organization of the 
city, town, or county. 
The Senior Nature Study Club. Membership in 
the Senior Nature Study Club is confined to 
students in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth 
grades. The club operates under its own consti- 
tution, providing for the usual officers, presi- 
dent, vice president, secretary, and treasurer. 
Committees are appointed by the president with
-P-A-G-E-74
    54 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
the approval of the sponsor to have charge of 
(a) program, (b) members, (c) transportation, 
and (d) special committees. The objectives of 
the club are as followsé 
1. To study the lives of plants and animals. 
2. To get out in the open and observe nature. 
3. To secure a better understanding of life 
functions. 
4. To inspire a love for nature: taking care 
of trees, birds, plants, and lawns. 
The activities of the club take the following 
form: 
. Lectures by authorities on nature study. 
. Programs prepared by the members. 
. Field study of definite problems. 
. Trips to museums, observatories, and con- 
servatories. 
. Trips to zodlogical gardens. 
6. Book reports from members on certain 
phases of nature study.

The Senior Dramatic Club. This club is organ- 
ized and officered by the students, as are the 
other clubs, with two faculty sponsors. Mem- 
bership is limited to students of the tenth, elev- 
enth, and twelfth grades. Fifty members (of 
both sexes) is established as the limit. Member-

ship is determined by oral testing. The organ- 
ization includes a stage manager, stage crew, 
electrician, business manager, and reporter. The 
objectives of the club are as follows: 
1. To encourage the dramatic interest which 
many students have and to give them an 
opportunity for self-expression. 
2. To promote an appreciation of dramatic 
literature. 
3. To study the drama as a means of inter- 
preting life. 
4. To play for the pure joy of playing. 
These objectives are gained through weekly 
meetings; the presentation of plays and stunts; 
reviews of plays; and lessons in make-up, stage 
eraft, and the fundamentals of public entertain- 
ments. 
The Life Saving Club. This club meets during 
the activities period once each week either in the 
swimming pool for demonstration and practice, 
or in a regular classroom for theory. <A defi- 
nite course in life saving is given. The Ameri- 
can Red Cross codperates in giving the course 
and at its conclusion an opportunity is given 
the members to take the standard Red Cross 
test. The award to those successfully passing 
the test is a membership certificate in the Red

ing careful while swimming or boating. 
2. To learn methods by which those in peril 
of drowning may be rescued with the least 
possible risk to the rescuer. 
3. To learn methods of inducing artificial 
respiration to persons overcome in the 
water. 
The activities of the club in theory and prac- 
tice are: 
1. To be able to disrobe and swim one hun- 
dred yards in deep water. 
2. Surface dive, recovering objects three 
times, and a ten-pound weight once. 
8. Standard methods of carrying a drowning 
person in the water, also methods of 
breaking holds secured by the drowning 
person. 
4. Knowledge of the Schaeffer method of re- 
suscitation; a 200-word essay on the sub-

subjects into boat, out of pool, on to floats. 
7. Oral quizzes on life saving. 
The Live Wire Club. This club is organized in 
connection with the electrical shop of the school. 
It meets once each week in the activities period 
and aims to meet the needs of boys who have a 
special interest in electricity, giving them an op- 
portunity to develop their initiative and, to a 
certain extent, to carry out their own ideas as 
to the design and construction of projects. 
The work is carried on in a competitive way, 
with special attention to neatness and accuracy. 
Such a club may choose, for example, bell-ring- 
ing transformers for its semester project. Hach 
boy makes his own working sketch from a model 
and procures his own material. Wireless ap- 
paratus, radios, and various other interesting 
electrical studies make suitable subjects for this 
club to work on.

CHAPTER IV 
STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN HIGH 
SCHOOL CONTROL 
This part of the extra-curricular program 
has been variously referred to as ‘‘Student Self- 
Government,’’ the ‘‘Junior Civic League,”’’ 
udent Welfare League,’’ ‘‘School Service 
Club,” “School Senate,’’ ete. None of these — 
‘terms fully describe the idea behind this part 
of the extra-curricular program. ‘‘Student Self- 
Government Organization’’ as a name has never 
been satisfactory. The term applied in the 
heading of this chapter seems most nearly to 
fit the idea schools are seeking to put into prac- 
tice at the present time. 
Underlying Principles. The following educa- 
tional principles have been more or less gen- 
erally accepted and are particularly apropos in 
connection with a discussion of this subject:

favorable to the development of self-gov- 
ernment because of the prominence of the 
characteristics of gregariousness, altruism, 
and restiveness under restraint. 
4. Since the nature of man is fundamentally 
social, his highest development can only 
be obtained through codperative activities. 
5. To train for democracy, the school must be 
a democracy. 
Just as children learn to write by writing and 
learn to read by reading, so they learn the prin- 
ciples of government by assuming responsibility 
and actually practicing citizenship in codpera- 
tive activities within the school. One of the 
richest veins in all education has been tapped 
in recent years by the recognition of these prin- 
ciples. If students are later to live the lives 
membership in the American democracy expects, 
provision must be made for them to live such 
lives within the school. 
The High School and Democracy. The first and 
perhaps the most important activity in the whole 
school program is student participation in the 
government of the school. In the final analysis, 
it is citizenship which is the first aim of the high 
school. 
In a circular recently sent out by the State
-P-A-G-E-81
  STUDENT PARTICIPATION 61 
Department of Education of the state of Penn- 
sylvania dealing with the subject of student and 
faculty activities the following statement ap- 
peared: 
The success of our democratic government and social 
order depends upon the intelligence, the conscience, and 
the skill with which the great mass of our people at- 
tack our political, social, and economical problems. The 
public high school is the one institution through which 
society can most directly and purposefully attack the 
problems of developing the intelligence, the conscience, 
and the skill essential to successful democracy. It is 
owned and run by society; it is open on equal terms 
to all the children of all the people; it has under its 
daily influence the group from which will come nearly 
all the leaders of thought and sentiment in the coming 
generations; and perhaps most important of all it has 
them at the time when they are more responsive to 
social appeals than at any other period of their lives. 
Clearly the first duty of the high school is to make 
its charges intelligent concerning the history, the phi- 
losophy, and the problems of democracy. It must en- 
list the personal devotion of our young people to the 
welfare of democracy at once, by showing them how inex- 
tricably their own happiness is involved in this welfare, 
and by appealing to their idealism, dominant in adoles- 
cence as in no other period. 
As the enacting clause of its instruction and of its 
emotional and ethical appeals, it must train in those 
skills that shall make the knowledge and devotion dy- 
namic in producing a better democratic social order. 
The high school has an unparalleled opportunity to de- 
velop these skills. Its problems are real, not make- 
believe; the welfare of the group depends upon codper-
-P-A-G-E-82
  62 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
ation and demands the subordination of individual to 
group interests; the responsibility and authority of the 
groups must be delegated to leaders; indeed, the success 
of the school depends upon a high standard of intelli- 
gence, conscience, and skill in solving the problems of 
the school community. 
If good citizenship is the product of proper knowl- 
edge, right ideals, and correct habits, and if it consists 
of being able and desirous of playing one’s full part 
in the codperative activities of one’s community, state 
and nation, then it is obvious that education for such 
citizenship must aim at creating social intelligence in 
citizens, on the one hand, and at increasing codperation 
to a maximum, on the other hand. 
Immediate Aims. One of the immediate aims of 
student participation in the government of the 
school is the teaching and practi 
control. The Latimer Junior High School of 
Pittsburgh, appreciating this truth, keeps this 
motto prominently before its students at all 
times: ‘‘Do it because it is right.’’ As the basis 
of achievement, self-control is the very begin- 
ning of right discipline. 
Closely related is the aim of self-reliance. 
Every student must be led to see that he is an 
important and integral part of the school com- 
munity, and that the school community will be 
just as good as he helps to make it. He must 
learn that to do the right thing he must rely on 
himself.
-P-A-G-E-83
STUDENT PARTICIPATION 63 
In former years the teacher sought to control 
his pupils. The modern aim is to have the pupils 
control themselves. But this can happen only 
when the teacher gives abundant opportunity 
for free choice. Now is the time of life in which 
the students are peculiarly affected by a craving 
for freedom, self-reliance, and the chance to 
show what they can do by themselves. 
A third aim is the recognition and_encourage- 
ment which student participation gives to initia- 
tive. A” student-government organization af- 
fords every opportunity for such encourage- 
ment. Every chance is given for the boy or 
girl actually to participate in the management 
of the school. An attitude which welcomes sug- 
gestions from the students ought to be a part 
of the plan and, whenever possible, the students 
should be given an opportunity to try out their 
own methods to see whether or not they will 
function in practice. They should see for them- 
selves. Such activity is perhaps the best de- 
veloper there is of initiative. There are plenty 
of school experiences, exigencies, and difficulties 
to test this ability fully. 
A fourth aim is the discovery and develop- ment of leadership. In student participation 
lies a Chance that this much-sought and rare 
human quality may be discovered, detected, and
-P-A-G-E-84
  64 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
developed. Consideration of this as an aim sug- 
gests several questions: 
1. Do we need leaders? : 
2. What should the schools do about develop- 
ing leaders? 
8. Should they select the superior minds and 
train them for leadership? 
4, What studies contribute most to developing 
leadership? 
5. What experiences contribute most? 
6. Are leaders born, or can.leadership be de- 
veloped? 
7. What are the essentials of leadership? 
Surely there is no greater need in the Ameri- 
can democracy today than a diversified and bal- 
anced leadership. The best thing the schools 
can do about developing leaders is to furnish 
the opportunity. If fundamentals are well es- 
tablished in the mind of a boy or girl, if the 
pupils have good character and are given the 
opportunity to do things, if they can be encour- 
aged to broaden their school work so as to in- 
clude participation in the different school ac- 
tivities, there is no doubt but that qualities of 
leadership will be developed. 
The surest way to develop leadership in stu- 
dents is to place responsibility upon them and
-P-A-G-E-85

-P-A-G-E-86
  
      
    
Junior Hicu Scuoot Boy Scour Troop
-P-A-G-E-87
STUDENT PARTICIPATION 65 
then guide and direct their efforts. Qualities of 
leadership are adaptability; quick, clear think- 
ing; initiative; integrity; self-confidence; broad 
vision; tact; good judgment; willingness to work; 
unselfishness; imagination; faith; courage; and 
enthusiasm. 
Teachers should be on the lookout for these 
qualities. Embryo leaders may thus be discov- 
ered, and the opportunity offered for develop- 
ing them. Leaders do not necessarily come 
from among those with the highest ‘‘I. Q.’s.’? They 
sometimes come from the most unsuspected 
sources. They are not necessarily born leaders. 
They must, of course, be endowed with a certain 
mental equipment, but education and practice 
will contribute more than a small share in train- 
ing leaders. The question of leadership is a big 
one, and in this connection more than a brief 
consideration cannot be attempted. 
The fifth aim is the establishment of oppor- 
tunity for codperation. One of the primary 
necessities in preparation for democratic life 
is worthy codperation. There is something woe- 
fully lacking in a citizenship which does no more 
than obey the law and refrain from infringe- 
ment upon the rights of others. 
In too many schools the aim encouraged by 
the actual conduct of the work is of a type which
-P-A-G-E-88
66 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
lays major stress upon ‘‘looking out all the time 
for number one.’’ Right thinking can no longer 
conceive of democracy as mainly a matter of 
everyone for himself within the limits of the 
law. That conception is altogether too common. 
Dr. Dewey has pointed out that this conception 
is symbolized by the very equipment of the or- 
dinary classroom: 
Each pupil sits by himself at a desk, which is fastened 
immovably to its place. Each occupies his own little island, 
from which as a general rule communication with all other 
islands is forbidden. This rigid separation typifies the im- 
portance attached to the virtues of non-interference. The 
class acts as a group only in obedience to orders from 
headquarters. This method overlooks the fact that while 
even in a democracy orders must be obeyed, the rules are 
not decreed by an autocrat but are willed by the group itself. 
Responsibility for the success or failure in the exe- 
eution rests with those who not only obey the orders 
but make them. 
A school of any reasonable size furnishes 
ample opportunity for codperative effort. The 
writer visited a high school in another city re- 
cently, and the first thing to attract his attention 
upon entering the door of the building was a 
motto reading as follows: ‘‘We work in codpera- 
tion.’’ Within a very few minutes it was appar- 
ent that this motto was a functioning, vital 
force in that school among all: administrators, 
faculty, and student body.
-P-A-G-E-89
STUDENT PARTICIPATION 67 
A sixth aim is the establishment of high ideals 
of citizenship. Participation of students in their 
school government does more than train for 
citizenship in the narrow sense. It is an effec- 
tive solution of many of the student problems 
arising in every school. The opportunity for 
active participation in social and local political 
problems thus afforded furnishes an outlet for 
that exuberant activity of youth so likely to ex- 
press itself in unworthy forms when no legiti- 
mate outlets are provided. Propensity for se- 
cret socities, social cliques, and such undesir- 
able by-products of the usual system of school 
control is simply the self-directed expression of 
the student’s social proclivities. 
Student participation develops the student 
personally. It fosters democracy, fair play, un- 
selfish service, consideration for the rights of 
others, and respect for the law of the social 
group. It cannot be too strongly emphasized 
that the purpose of democratic student codpera- 
tion in school control is neither merely disci- 
pline nor better management of details. In this 
there is scant evidence that democracy is more 
efficient than is despotism at its best. The ad- 
vantages of democracy are largely spiritual, and 
the beneficent results of democratic school ad- 
ministration are to be found in habits of thought, 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
    68 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
feeling, and action, rather than in mere con- 
formity to rules. However efficient its organiza- 
tion and its instruction in mere subject matter, 
the American high school fails in its most im- 
portant function if it fails to develop the qual- 
ities of good democratic citizenship. High 
ideals of citizenship should be kept prominently 
before the students all the time. In one junior 
high school the following poster is found in a 
prominent place in every classroom:

1. Qualities that make for true citizenship: 
High sense of honor. 
Fairness. 
Helpfulness. 
Politeness. 
Tact. 
Doing of right because it is right. 
2. Initiative, that is, resourcefulness, enthusiasm, and 
leadership shown in voluntary service for the school. 
3. Passing grades in all subjects, resulting from 
earnest effort. 
4. Growth in self-control, consideration for the rights 
of others, and a sense of civic responsibility. 
The seventh aim is a little more general in 
character. It is that more or less indefinite 
something popularly called school spirit. School 
spirit is essentially a disposition of mind on the
-P-A-G-E-91
  STUDENT PARTICIPATION 69 
part of students which holds dear the ideals of 
the school. 
As a vital means of developing school spirit, 
student government holds a rare place. There 
should be no mistake about the value of school 
spirit as a moving force. It may be developed 
to such an extent that its force is felt through- 
out the school and even beyond the school—in 
the community. This is of real value to the 
community as well as the school, because in the 
final analysis there is only the difference of 
contact between school spirit and community 
spirit. School-spirit activity is simply practice 
training for a virile and efficient citizenship. 
Other aims which might be developed in this 
discussion are: 
Ercutu: Ability to see the other side of a 
question. 
Ninto: Sense of personal and group respon- 
sibility. 
TzentH: Respect for law and order, or sense 
of distinction between liberty and license.

CHAPTER V 
STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN HIGH 
SCHOOL CONTROL (Continued) 
Elements of Success. Student-government or- 
ganizations are not new. Many plans have been 
tried throughout the country with varying de- 
grees of success. Many efforts along this line 
have been complete failures. The reason for 
such failures may often be traced to the fact that 
the organizations were adopted as disciplinary 
measures. Better discipline undoubtedly comes 
as a by-product of student participation in 
school control but it ought not to be the primary 
purpose of the organization. Let it be kept con- 
stantly in mind that the primary purpose of 
such an organization is training in junior citi- 
zenship. If student participation in high school 
control is to be successful, certain fundamental 
points must be kept in mind. 
In the first place there must be a realization 
of the need for such an organization by both 
faculty members and pupils. Before putting a 
student-government organization into effect in 
70
-P-A-G-E-93
STUDENT PARTICIPATION 71 
a certain high school, the writer appointed a 
committee of faculty members, with an enthu- 
siastic chairman, to make a complete study of 
the whole question. The committee was in- 
structed to make a complete and formal report 
to the entire faculty by the close of the first 
semester. The members had almost five months 
to study the question and make the report. 
When it was finally ready, it was submitted to 
the faculty and an opportunity for discussion 
allowed. The discussion was thorough and dem- 
ocratic, and several changes were suggested. 
Then it was put to a vote and adopted unani- 
mously by the faculty of seventy-two members. 
It was understood that the plan should be given 
a fair trial and that during the trial the group 
should give it undivided support. When the 
matter was submitted to the students in their 
home rooms, it easily gained adoption. It has 
been the experience of many, more than once, 
that faculty members have often stood in the 
way of progress, not the students. Faculty sup- 
port, enthusiastic and hearty, must be given to 
any plan for student participation, or it will be 
doomed to failure. Secondly, teachers and stu- 
dents must be thoroughly familiar with the 
plan before it is put into effect. The way for 
its adoption and operation must be prepared. 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
72 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
It is possible to accomplish this largely in the 
activities period, through class or home-room 
discussion. 
In the third place, student participation in 
government should be introduced gradually. It 
is not wise to try to put all of such a plan as 
is described in this volume into effect at once. 
A fourth point to be borne in mind is that a 
plan to be successful must be a simple one, 
adapted to local needs. No one has a patent on 
any one plan. One suited to the needs of a jun- 
ior high school ought perhaps to be considerably 
altered to suit a senior high school or a junior- 
senior high school. Similarly, the best plan ever 
devised for a large high school might have to be 
modified to meet the needs of a small high school. 
In the fifth place, there must be constant, in- 
visible supervision. It is because of a lack of 
this element that many plans fail to accom- 
plish results. Every member of the teaching 
staff must be alert to see that things run 
smoothly. It is the business of faculty members 
to act in this connection as guidance directors. 
They should be careful, however, not to inter- 
fere with or destroy initiative. Students should 
never be allowed to get the idea that the prin- 
cipal and faculty are not the final authority in 
the school. Legally constituted authority must
-P-A-G-E-95
  STUDENT PARTICIPATION 73 
be clearly understood to reside in them under 
all circumstances. 
Since the author may be misunderstood in re- 
lation to this fifth point, it might be well to call 
the attention of the reader to the fact that in- 
visible supervision means that these junior citi- 
zens are likely to need sympathy and help all 
along the line. It does not mean a constant in- 
terference with the freedom of the students in 
the matter of working out their plans, but it does 
mean an alertness to detect weakness and fail- 
ure and a ready response in giving suggestions 
and helpful direction. Too many high school 
principals in former days were too ready to 
turn the control and discipline of the school 
over entirely to the student body with inevitable 
failure as the result. 
This attitude is in no way contrary to the 
spirit of democracy and freedom of action advo- 
cated by the author. Junior citizens in either a 
junior or senior high school are not ready for 
self-government any more than the inhabitants 
of the Philippine Islands were ready for self- 
government when the United States assumed 
control. They need guidance and direction in 
their activities but should be given plenty of op- 
portunity to practice citizenship with the mini- 
mum of help needed to assure success.
-P-A-G-E-96
  74 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
In pursuance of this thought it might be stated 
that when absolute veto power is advocated for 
the principal it does not mean that he is going 
to stand in the way of suggestions from the stu- 
dent body but it does mean that his approval 
must be secured before new policies can become 
effective. No one would assume that these jun- 
ior citizens could pass measures over the veto 
of the principal. 
As a sixth point the necessity of avoiding any 
conception of student participation in govern- 
ment as a disciplinary device might be men- 
tioned. This has already been noted, but it 
needs to be emphasized. 
In the seventh place, there must be direct re- 
sponsibility in the supervision and direction of 
the Student-Government Organization. An or- 
ganization such as this will not run itself. Un- 
less the school is small, it is necessary that the 
principal appoint a faculty member to supervise 
the work of the organization. In a school with 
an enrollment of eighteen hundred, the writer 
found it advisable to place the supervision of 
the organization in the hands of a person devot- 
ing half time to the task. This meant that the 
teacher appointed gave one half of every day 
to supervision. 
The size of the school, the nature of the Stu-
-P-A-G-E-97
  STUDENT PARTICIPATION 75 
dent-Government Organization adopted, and the 
resourcefulness of the principal in the matter of 
getting the school board to supply an adequate 
teaching force are the determining factors in 
this point. The main thing to keep in mind is 
that some one will have to be constantly direct- 
ing the organization if it is to succeed.

In the past four years this constitution has 
been a functioning plan, and has become one of 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  84 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
the distinctive features of the institution. The 
students have learned lessons about the selec- 
tion of their officers which should, within a few 
years, prove valuable to them as they go about 
the selection of their officers in local, state, and 
national elections. The pupils are given prac- 
tically a free hand in the election of their offi- 
cers, since it is recognized that this is a part of 
their education. Qualifications for office are 
freely discussed before the nominations are 
made. In most instances, it may be said, the 
students make wise and acceptable choices. 
One notable exception to this in the writer’s 
experience is worth mentioning as illustrating 
the point that this type of activity is training 
in citizenship. A boy had been nominated for 
vice president of the Student Council because 
of his athletic prowess and not because he had 
real qualifications for the office. Some of the 
members of the faculty thought that his name 
should be withdrawn, but the principal took the 
position that the situation presented a fine op- 
portunity for training in junior citizenship. 
The boy’s name was permitted to go on the 
ballot and he was elected. It was customary 
to have the officers preside at all assembly meet- 
ings. The principal arranged to have the newly 
elected vice president ‘preside at the next as-
-P-A-G-E-107
  
STUDENT PARTICIPATION 85 
sembly. His duties were to read the morning 
lesson from the Holy Writ, lead his fellow stu- 
dents in the Lord’s Prayer, make all announce- 
ments, and have charge of the assembly pro- 
gram. It is needless to say that the operation 
was so painful to both the new vice president 
and his fellow students that through his own 
initiative his resignation was forthcoming and 
a new vice president replaced him. The inci- 
dent served as one of the most forceful lessons 
in democracy the writer has ever observed. The 
students are permitted to conduct a two- or 
three-day election campaign preliminary to the 
election. This is another opportunity to train 
in citizenship. Speech making, poster advertis- 
ing, and even personal solicitation are included 
in the program. This gives an opportunity to 
train students in fair dealing through correct 
representation of the facts. That there is plenty 
of need for such, training is only too clearly seen 
outside of the walls of school buildings. If all 
high schools in America were training in jun- 
ior citizenship, it would not be too much to pre- 
dict that it would not be long before there would 
be a changed situation in a great deal of politics 
outside of the schools. 
The Student Council. The Student Council, as 
outlined in the foregoing constitution, is a worth- 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
86 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
while organization. It is conducted on a basis 
of high standards. In its meetings, which are 
held during the activities period, questions of all 
kinds dealing with the welfare of the school are 
discussed and acted upon. The writer has found 
this part of the student organization most help- 
ful, and has received from it many suggestions 
for the welfare of the school which proved to 
be practical in every way. It has a marked in- 
fluence in the school, doing just what the word- 
ing of the constitution suggests. It sets before 
the student body the ideals of good citizenship 
in deeds as well as words. ‘The officers are 
leaders in fact as well as in name and are given 
prominent recognition on many occasions. 
Through their work in presiding at assemblies, 
and through personal contacts with every part 
of the organization, they become helpful and 
useful individuals in the school. The director of 
the Student-Government Organization is a mem- 
ber of the Student Council, and acts as its ad- 
viser. The principal is an ex-officio member. 
Report-Class or Home-Room Organization. Ag 
stated before, this is the heart of the extra-cur- 
ricular program and the Student-Government 
Organization. It is this unit of organization 
through which the Student Council largely func- 
tions. The home room is represented in council,
-P-A-G-E-109
  
STUDENT PARTICIPATION 87 
and receives a complete report of the activities 
of that body through this representative. It ef- 
fects a community spirit among its members. 
Through the home room the individual student 
is reached most easily, a feature which has 
been described along with others in a previous 
chapter. 
The Assembly Squad. The members of the As- 
sembly Squad have charge of the seating of the 
classes and guests. They attend to the ventila- 
tion of the assembly room. They darken the 
room when the stereopticon or motion-picture 
machine is to be used and are the ‘‘stage hands.’’ 
When evening meetings or entertainments are 
held, the sale or distribution of tickets, ushering, 
and other arrangements are taken care of by this 
squad. 
The Patrol Squad. The Patrol Squad has charge 
of traffic in the halls during the change of 
classes. Stationed at strategic points through- 
out the halls of the entire building, they con- 
trol the movements of the students and have 
the authority to report cases of traffic disobe- 
dience or bad conduct to the principal or di- 
rector of the Student-Government Organization. 
The respect shown these traffic officers by their 
fellow students has on more than one occasion 
been a source of amazement to the writer. Obe-  
-P-A-G-E-110
  88 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
dience to these officers has been rendered with 
much greater willingness than was ever experi- 
enced under the old plan of faculty supervision 
of room changes. Members of the squad are ap- 
pointed by the president of the Student Council, 
with the consent of the principal or director of 
the Student-Government Organization. In order 
to give a larger number of students an oppor- 
tunity to serve, the officers are changed fre- 
quently. As students are always anxious to 
serve on the Patrol Squad, there is a constant 
waiting list of those personally applying for the 
service. This plan is particularly adapted to the 
junior high school age. As a mark of distinc- 
tion, the members of the squad wear a blue band 
on their arms, with the letter ‘‘P’’ inscribed 
thereon. 
The Sanitation Squad. The members of the San- 
itation Squad are appointed by the vice presi- 
dent with the consent of the Student-Giovern- 
ment Organization and work under his direction. 
It is their business to see that the halls are 
clean, that toilets are in proper condition, that 
the pavements around the building are free from 
paper and refuse, and that the school building 
generally is kept clean in every feature about 
which there is any student responsibility. 
Through the efforts of this squad it becomes a
-P-A-G-E-111
  STUDENT PARTICIPATION 89 
matter of school pride that no waste paper or 
litter can ever be found on any floor in the 
building. 
The Lunch Room Squad. The members of the 
Lunch Room Squad are known as monitors. 
Each room has at least one monitor. It is the 
duty of the monitor to conduct his class each 
day at the lunch period to an assigned table, 
attend to the seating and conduct of his group, 
and be responsible for the neatness and clean- 
liness of the table and the floor underneath and 
near it. His responsibility includes the return 
of all dishes and the placing of refuse in the 
receptacles provided for this purpose. 
In addition to these monitors, two or three 
older students are appointed to act as supervi- 
sors in the lunch room. The only member of the 
faculty who has any duties in connection with 
the plan is the director of the Student-Govern- 
ment Organization. After the first ten minutes 
of the period, the students are allowed perfect 
freedom on the lunch-room floor of the building. 
Some dance, some study, some stand about in 
conversational groups, and others go outdoors 
for the remainder of the period. Order under 
the plan is better than it had been before when, 
under the faculty system, three or four faculty 
members were charged with the responsibility
-P-A-G-E-112
  90 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
of maintaining order in the lunch room. It be- 
comes a student lunch: room, and the students 
take pride in keeping it orderly and clean. On 
more than one occasion the writer has been grat- 
ified in conducting visitors through the lunch 
room at the close of the third lunch period, after 
more than eighteen hundred students had eaten, 
to illustrate the cleanliness insisted upon by the 
students themselves. Refuse, paper, or litter 
of any kind is rarely found on the floor even 
at the close of this period. 
The Ushers Squad. The members of this squad 
are appointed by the president of the Student 
Council with the approval of the principal. Com- 
posed of selected students this squad renders 
service in various ways, subject to the call of the 
principal’s office. The squad members conduct 
visitors around the school, introducing them to 
the teachers and explaining the work of the de- 
partments. They are familiar with the school’s 
aims and are able to answer intelligently the 
questions of visitors. They respond, as children 
always do when given responsibility, with a full 
measure of efficiency. 
A careful analysis of the constitution de- 
scribed will show that every officer of every unit 
in the plan is given a definite assignment. The
-P-A-G-E-113
STUDENT PARTICIPATION 91 
associate representatives, for example, who are 
to act in the capacity of representatives when 
the regular representatives are absent, act as the 
health officials of the home rooms. They are 
members of the Health Club, one of the active 
organizations in the school. The secretary-treas- 
urer of the home room serves also as a member 
of the Student Social Committee, in charge of 
school-wide social activities. It must be borne 
in mind, of course, that the constitution under 
which this organization operates was designed 
for a large junior high school with a large and 
varied student body. It may be easily simpli- 
fied, however, to meet the needs of the smaller 
school. 
The writer has gone into detailed explanation 
of the above plan because of a close familiarity 
with its operation. The following plans are 
offered to show the variations possible in work- 
ing out student-government forms of organiza- 
tion. The La Junta Junior High School, La 
Junta, Colorado, drew up the following consti- 
tution for its student codperative organization. 
The constitution, which was submitted to the 
writer in his class at Colorado State Teachers 
College, is presented without comment to show 
other possible features:

Section 5 
At the time of class elections the General Council shall 
furnish the student body the names of the nominees for 
members at large in the General Council. There shall be 
at least two nominees from each class, the 12-A and the 
12-B, one to be elected from each class and voted on by 
all members of the Codperative Organization. 
Section 6 
Each of the twelve classes shall have a Class Guardian, 
a member of the faculty, designated by the principal. The 
principal, may, if he sees fit, permit the class to elect its 
own Guardian, a member of the faculty. It shall be the 
duty of the Class Guardian to attend all meetings of the 
class, or appoint some one in his place upon occasions, to 
advise with the class in its deliberations and activities, and 
to see that all meetings are conducted in an orderly and 
parliamentary manner. 
Section 7 
Each of the four highest classes is permitted to hold 
one evening social function each semester, and not more 
than one; provided that the 12th grade classes may be 
permitted an additional one by the faculty supervisor, 
(such as the Junior Prom); and provided further that 
upon occasions two groups may be permitted to join in 
one evening social, which shall be considered as one for 
each of the groups represented. 
At evening socials at least a part of the program must 
be given over to other forms of amusement than dancing, 
excepting at the Junior Prom. 
Only members of the class itself shall be permitted to 
attend its social functions, and members of the faculty or 
other invited adult guests. 
The date of any social meeting shall be scheduled on the 
high school calendar at least one week before the event.

  CHAPTER VI 
THE SCHOOL ASSEMBLY 
Underlying Principles. The principles which 
underlie the organization and conduct of the 
school assembly are discussed in this chapter. 
I. Develops School Unity 
The school assembly will develop a higher de- 
gree of group consciousness within the school 
and a better realization of the power of group 
action for achieving desirable ends for the 
school, community, state, and nation. Its chief 
contribution to the student body is that spirit 
which may be called ‘‘school unity.’’ 
Students are divided into classes according to 
their academic advancement, further divided by 
their curricula, and still further divided by their 
recitation groups. The same breaking-up proc- 
ess is carried on in the diversity of extra-cur- 
ricular activities and is encouraged by the differ- 
ences in the locations and social positions of 
the homes from which the students come. Block- 
ing the pathway to unity is an almost infinite 
variety of individual differences. The assembly 
108  
-P-A-G-E-131
  THE SCHOOL ASSEMBLY 109 
is the one agency at hand capable of checking 
these tendencies. It is the contact point which 
should aim to stress those factors and interests 
common to all. This may be done through teach- 
ing the students to sing together, by programs 
that explore for the students and teacher the 
interests and activities of each subject-matter 
department, by the development of public opin- 
ion in the school, by the engendering of support 
for those representing the school in inter-school 
contests, by programs in which representatives 
of the entire school take part, and by efforts in- 
tended to show the student body that worth- 
while and interesting work is being done by the 
other grades and groups. 
II. Encourages School Spirit 
The school assembly affords the greatest op- 
portunity to develop school spirit. School spirit 
is like the term personality; it is hard to de- 
fine, but it is something felt and recognized. It 
is that composite of school experiences which 
makes codperation and enthusiasm for the 
school’s welfare a joy and a pleasure. It is a 
spiritual atmosphere which pervades the whole 
student body, affecting custodians, teachers, ad- 
ministrators, and students alike. 
A real school assembly can help to create
-P-A-G-E-132
  110 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
this spirit. ‘It is a matter of regret that there 
are many high schools in America which have 
failed to get the vision of school spirit as a vital, 
moving, energizing influence in the school. 
Ill. Provides Motivation for Curricular 
Activities 
An attitude of respect for knowledge is cul- 
tivated, especially when representative groups 
are given an assembly period in which to share 
with the entire school knowledge they have 
gained in their individual classes and groups. 
Assembly programs to a large extent should 
grow out of regular class and extra-curricular 
activities. This sharing of knowledge gives a 
social value to information. It stimulates those 
to whom the program is assigned because in 
working up their material they are enabled to 
see the value it possesses for others. A science 
demonstration given in assembly cannot fail to 
arouse interest in science. Conducting an elec- 
tion in assembly on primary or election day 
ought to arouse interest in civics. 
IV. Stimulates Interest in Extra-curricular 
Activities 
Assembly programs serve in many ways to 
widen and deepen the interests of the students.
-P-A-G-E-133
  THE SCHOOL ASSEMBLY 111 
Science clubs may give a demonstration of 
‘‘wireless’’; the students interested in the school 
newspaper may give a demonstration of the proc- 
ess of getting it out from day to day or from 
week to week. Accounts may be given of class 
or club excursions. The program presents a 
splendid opportunity for the development of ap- 
preciation of literature. By means of original 
short stories, poems, or readings given in as- 
sembly, other students may be brought to realize 
that at least the beginning of literary work is 
not surrounded by magic. 
One-act plays, or scenes from longer ones, pre- 
pared in class or in the Dramatic Club, may 
be presented with simplified stage settings and 
costuming. Thus the members of the group are 
given a chance to express themselves, and the 
student onlookers may themselves become inter- 
ested in dramatics. Clubs of all kinds may find 
an outlet for some of their activities in prepar- 
ing a program for assembly. 
V. Stimulates Expression and Overcomes 
Self-consciousness 
Every student who appears before his fellows 
in assembly naturally wants to make a good im- 
pression. If he is properly coached, he will use 
simple language and will pitch his voice so that 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  a 112 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
he can be heard by all. The trait of self-con- 
sciousness is universal in those appearing for 
the first time before large audiences. The only 
way to overcome this handicap is to pratice. 
The school assembly affords the opportunity. 
If the emphasis is placed on presenting ideas 
clearly and intelligibly, so that hearers under- 
stand and get the point, the value of training 
in expression may be great. 
VI. Builds Up Proper Habits and Attitudes 
in Audiences 
What should the student body do while the 
orchestra is playing, when a speaker is speak- 
ing, in the matter of applause? The writer was 
visiting a high school recently and was invited 
to the school assembly. Taking a seat in the 
rear of the hall, he noticed that the announce- 
ment that the orchestra would give a selection 
was the signal for a general talk-fest among the 
whole group. This was an example of what 
ought not to be allowed, if students are to be 
trained in the right kind of attitude. Unfor- 
tunately, grown people indulge in this same bad 
habit, but perhaps they would not display this 
tendency to such an extent had they been trained 
in the right attitude while they were members 
of student audiences in school. In his own ex-

  THE SCHOOL ASSEMBLY 113 
perience, the writer has insisted, as principal of 
a junior high school, upon full attention on the 
part of the student body during selections by the 
orchestra. This can be accomplished with prac- 
tically one hundred per cent efficiency if the 
high school principal avails himself of the aid 
of the Student-Government Organization. 
Students must be trained in the matter of 
applause as well. There should be perfect 
freedom in this respect. Applause ought not 
to be suppressed, but very often needs to be 
directed, so that it will be done sanely and 
with a certain amount of intelligence. Drastic 
action may be necessary in the case of cer- 
tain individual students at first, but they will 
soon learn that order is the thing to be de- 
sired and will obey the unwritten law of the 
school. The question of attitude in audiences 
is really a part of (or should be a part of) the 
education of every student and merits the at- 
tention of any high school. 
Vil. Affords Opportunity to Share Information 
When the participation in assembly programs 
is wisely distributed, there is training for a large 
percentage of the school in the expression of 
worth-while ideas to an interested group. In 
so far as the actual presentation is concerned,
-P-A-G-E-138
  114 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
it might be as well or better done by members 
of the faculty, but the educational value that 
lies in organizing, preparing, and presenting 
the material would be lost to the students. The 
teacher does not rob the student of his educa- 
tional opportunity by solving his mathematical 
problems for him: rather he aids him by advis- 
ing and guiding him in their solution. In the 
same manner the teacher aids the students in 
the presentation of assembly programs. Stu- 
dents manifest intense interest in information 
given when it comes from one of their own 
number. They are willing to work hard in 
gathering material, in making charts, in antici- 
pating possible questions, and in getting a com- 
mand of the subject that will enable them to 
present it in assembly in a finished and scholarly 
way. 
VIII. Creates Intelligent Public Opinion in 
the School 
Since all people, particularly young people, 
are greatly influenced by the approval or dis- 
approval of their fellows, the participation of 
teachers and students in a conscious effort to 
form intelligent public opinion is of great im- 
portance in training citizens. 
The assembly is one place to form public 
opinion. Many high school problems that de-
-P-A-G-E-139
  THE SCHOOL ASSEMBLY 115 
pend largely on public opinion demand the 
united effort of the whole group for their solu- 
tion. What shall be the attitude of the school in 
the matter of scholarship? What responsibili- 
ties shall the students, with their advisers, assume 
in the direction of extra-curricular activities? 
What has the school done in the past .to merit 
the estimation in which it has been regarded in 
the community? What should be the school’s 
attitude toward its athletic teams, visiting 
teams, iits ‘‘rooters,’’ and visiting ‘‘rooters’’? 
What should be its attitude toward the build- 
ing? Toward punctuality and regularity in at- 
tendance? How shall the students treat visitors 
in the building; in classes? What should be the 
student’s attitude toward individual property? 
These are a few of the problems that the whole 
school, student body, and faculty must decide. 
The principal could solve all these problems 
himself and announce the solution to the school, 
but even if he could solve them and put them 
into effect, an opportunity would be lost, be- 
cause he would have robbed the students of the 
educative thinking and acting before them. By 
discussing problems of this type in home rooms, 
in class organizations, in student senates, and in 
assemblies, the students are educating themselves 
for citizenship. The democratic solution of these 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
    116 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
problems may be slower than an order from the 
principal’s office, but the principal who works 
through this process will get more lasting and 
more satisfactory results. The function of the 
school assembly in forming public opinion and in 
developing a sense of unity in the school may be 
carried further if some of the assemblies are 
devoted to the transaction of certain extra- 
curricular business. 
In the assembly the campaigns for school elec- 
tions, the installation of student officers, the 
awarding of insignia or recognition of excellence 
in any form may occur. The assembly may take 
the form of a town meeting to consider the needs 
of the school, the improvement of its internal 
life, or its relations with outside groups. The 
combative spirit developed in the assembly to 
‘back up the team’’ may be used to eliminate 
abuses or promote school virtues. The assem- 
bly may aid in tuning up the whole institution. 
Singing the best songs, producing the best plays 
and watching them, staging debates, spreading 
the news of what the various departments in the 
school are doing, listening to the presentation 
of ideas by those who understand and believe in 
them, and acting jointly in the interest of what 
is best—all this is a tuning-up process which is
-P-A-G-E-141
ee ee ee he ee 
THE SCHOOL ASSEMBLY 117 
of immense benefit. to the hearers and of still 
greater value to the participants. 
The mental attitude and mood of a school at 
the close of an assembly period is not an acci- 
dent when an assembly committee composed of 
teachers and students in active codperation has 
planned and directed the presentation of a school 
program. Students, faculty members, adminis- 
trative officers, and visitors have left the assem- 
bly hall on more than one occasion inspired to 
do a better day’s work because of the enthusiasm 
and spirit engendered there. 
IX. Develops the Aesthetic Senses 
There is no better place to develop the aes- : 
thetic senses than in the assembly program. 
Through its promotion of art, music, literature, 
and the drama, interest in these matters is fos- 
tered and oftentimes talent is discovered and 
encouraged. 
Administration of the School Assembly. School 
assemblies should hold a definite place in the 
school program. They should be held once each 
week, during a period one hour in length. A 
short period of fifteen or twenty minutes each 
day with a program which consists of morning 
exercises and a few announcements is not very 
valuable except to give tone to the day. It can-
-P-A-G-E-142
    118 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
not in any sense take the place of the school 
assembly. The activities period is the logical 
time in which to hold the school assembly. 
Auditorium limitations and the character of 
the school have much to do with determining the 
size of an assembly. Generally it is advanta- 
geous to have the entire student body and faculty 
in assembly at one time. It is not wise to do 
this, however, if the student body exceeds fifteen 
hundred in enrollment. Then it is better to di- 
vide the school into two assembly sections. The 
same program, in most instances, can be given 
in both assemblies. When more than fifteen 
hundred students gather in an assembly hall, it 
is probable that the youthful speakers will en- 
counter difficulty in making themselves heard. 
In a junior-senior high school of a thousand 
students, it would seem advisable to conduct a 
junior and a senior assembly, a policy which has 
been followed in the junior-senior high schools 
of Pittsburgh. With this in mind the board of 
public education in this city has adopted as a 
standard for several high schools in its building 
program an auditorium which will accommodate 
one half of the student enrollment. Economic 
interests as well as those mentioned have been 
found to lie in favor of this plan.
-P-A-G-E-143
  THE SCHOOL ASSEMBLY 119 
Supervision of the School Assembly. The school 
assembly should be under the direct supervision 
of the principal, the director of activities, or 
some individual delegated by the principal to 
have charge of the assembly. Except in a small 
high school, the principal could not assume the 
responsibility. The natural person to do this is 
the director of the club activities. This officer 
has charge of the club program in the school 
and, since a major part of the assembly program 
comes from the clubs under her direction, it is 
fitting that she should have general charge. 
The director should have the support of a 
faculty committee or a joint student-faculty 
committee. It is essential that the programs for 
assembly be prepared with care and thoughtful- 
ness, and the work should be planned several 
weeks in advance. 
On most occasions, student officers should pre- 
side at the assemblies, although the principal 
should do so from time to time in order to main- 
tain the dignity and prominence of the assembly 
in the school program. He-should always be 
present, remaining in the background, but ready 
to assume charge when it is evident that student 
direction is weakening. The students should be 
assigned to regular seats so that responsibility
-P-A-G-E-144
120 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
for conduct and attendance can be easily fixed. 
The teachers should sit with the students. 
The Assembly Squad of the Student-Govern- 
ment Organization, described in a previous chap- 
ter, performs useful services for the assembly. 
No program should be permitted to run for more 
than an hour, and all assemblies should begin 
promptly. In the ideal type of student-managed 
assembly, announcements and introductions of 
speakers should be made by the student officers. 
Student officers and other speakers should be 
introduced to each other and to outside speakers. 
A spirit of full codperation should at all times 
be sought for and maintained. 
While student participation should be the 
main characteristic of the assembly, every pos- 
sible effort should be made to bring the public, 
especially the parents of students, into the 
audience. Special invitations should be sent 
each week to the parents of students taking part 
in the program. Experience has shown that this 
feature pays big dividends in bringing together 
school and community and in cementing the 
loyalty of both students and parents to the policy 
of the school. The principal should keep a record 
of all assembly programs and should take steps 
to see that there is general participation at all 
times.
-P-A-G-E-145
  THE SCHOOL ASSEMBLY 121 
Nature of Assembly Programs. Many demands 
come from without the school for time and place 
on the assembly program. The public has not 
been slow to learn the advertising value of the 
school. It is safe to say that most of these 
requests ought to be refused, but certain of them 
deserve and demand the support of the institu- 
tion. Requests made by the National Safety 
Council, the Tuberculosis League, and such 
municipal organizations as a City-planning Com- 
mission ought to receive consideration by the 
principal in approving the assembly program. 
Only the very best outside speakers should 
ever be invited to address the students. It is 
good policy to limit outside speakers to those 
whose platform ability is tested and tried. No 
matter how distinguished a guest may be, unless 
he possesses the elemental qualifications of a 
good public speaker his effect on the student 
audience is likely to prove disastrous. 
Outside speakers may be used to advantage 
during the first part of the semester, while clubs 
and other organizations are getting under way 
and working on their first programs. 
The writer would recommend that the first 
assembly be devoted to what is called in modern 
parlance a ‘‘pep’’ meeting. The purpose of such 
an assembly is to introduce the new students to
-P-A-G-E-146
  122 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
the spirit of the school. Students themselves 
have charge of this program. They sing the 
school songs and give the school yells; the school 
orchestra plays. In a series of short, snappy 
talks, student speakers tell about the different 
features of the school: its government, customs, 
and regulations, such as lunch-room procedure, 
traffic rules, and conduct at games. The ‘‘pep’’ 
assembly is and ought to be an occasion for in- 
jecting every possible ounce of enthusiasm into 
the beginning life of the new school year. 
The following outline is suggestive of the rich- 
ness of material available for school assemblies: 
I. Programs whose chief purpose is the revealing and 
widening of experiences, the sharing of experiences, 
the imparting of knowledge, the reporting of activities 
and excursions, demonstrations of class and elub work, 
and visual instruction. 
II. Celebration of special days, such as Columbus Day, 
Armistice Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas, Par- 
ents’ Day, May Day, Lincoln’s Birthday, Washing- 
ton’s Birthday, Arbor Day, Memorial Day, Class 
Day, and Flag Day. 
III. Important Anniversaries (local). 
IV. Art Assembly.

  CHAPTER VII 
SOCIAL FUNCTIONS IN THE HIGH 
SCHOOL 
Educational Values. Gregariousness is one of 
the primal characteristics of adolescence. This 
is the gang, club, set, clique age, especially in 
the earlier years. It is a normal desire for boys 
and girls to want to have regular and pleasant 
associations with other boys and girls. Adoles- 
cents are social animals. It is very difficult for 
a high school boy or girl to refuse an invitation 
to join a fraternity, a club, or an organization. 
The following extract is from Clark’s The 
High School Boy:* 
The social activities of the young almost always seem ex- 
cessive to the middle-aged. There are few things which we 
forget so easily as the es¢apades of youth. A middle- 
aged father was advising his young son against the evils 
of dancing. 
“But you danced, father, when you were a boy,” the 
boy protested. 
“True,” the father replied, “but I have seen the folly 
of it.”

“Well,” the boy replied, “I want to see the folly of it, 
too.” 
When we are tempted to be too critical of the 
social customs of the young today, it might be 
well to remember that customs change. The 
pleasures in which the writer indulged as a boy 
are very different from those in which his son 
takes delight. He is inclined to think that his 
son’s social life in school has been much saner 
and more restrained than his own. 
In the ‘‘good old days,’’ the entire aim of the 
school was to develop the intellect to its highest 
powers, regardless of the social or even the 
physical needs of the individual. High school 
principals and teachers considered it their duty 
to crush or to restrain these social impulses of 
the students. Because of this attitude high 
schools everywhere had real social problems and 
even to this day these problems exist in many 
places. Laws have been made by state legisla- 
tures and drastic rules have been passed by 
school boards to curb high school fraternities, 
sororities, dancing, and other ‘‘evils.’’ This 
attempt to restrict the social impulses and ad- 
vantages of pupils of high-school age has fre- 
quently met with failure because it was unnatural, 
illogical, and unsympathetic. The problem was 
attacked from the wrong direction.
-P-A-G-E-156
130 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
Fortunately, high school people today realize 
the importance and the opportunity of guiding 
and training these immature boys and girls in 
the proper conduct of their social activities. 
Progressive secondary schools are organizing 
all manner of social activities among the students 
so that the benefits of the social training to be 
obtained will be open to the largest possible 
number. If students who show initiative, quali- 
ties of leadership, and executive ability are given 
opportunity to develop these traits along with 
their scholastic attainments, it will redound to 
the social life of the school, to the support of the 
administration, and to their own social improve- 
ment. Fortunately, this point of view is develop- 
ing very rapidly. There is a social problem, but 
it is a problem of administration, guidance, di- 
rection, time schedule, and management, rather 
than a problem of restriction, enforcement of 
Jaw, and detection. 
There are certain definite educational values 
connected with school social functions which 
must be kept in mind: 
1. Students need social training. 
The social training many students get in the 
school is the only social training they do get. 
Boys and girls ought to know to some extent 
how to carry on a conversation, how to please
-P-A-G-E-157
SOCIAL FUNCTIONS 131 
people, how to come and go without awkward- 
ness and embarrassment. Nothing causes self- 
consciousness more than a lack.of acquaintance 
with social usage and social forms, and nothing 
remedies this deficiency more than a little prac- 
tice and experience coupled with wise counsel. 
There is also a value to the growing boy and 
girl in learning how to meet men and women 
older than themselves, as well as those of their 
own age, and it should be a necessary part of 
their education that they do so. 
2. Students need to know about conventional 
customs. 
Another educational value to be kept in mind 
is the necessity of students learning many im- 
portant things about conventional social customs 
and to have a respect for them. In themselves 
these customs may mean little, but observance 
of them marks one as experienced and thought- 
ful, whereas neglect of them is evidence that one 
is either crude or careless. It is a little thing to 
call after one has been invited to dinner, to rise 
when a lady comes into the room, to speak to the 
hostess or the chaperons at a party, to remove 
one’s hat when talking to a woman on the street, 
to eliminate such terms as ‘‘say’’ and “‘listen’’ 
when beginning a conversation; but these are the  
-P-A-G-E-158
  132 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
things distinguishing a trained from an un- 
trained individual. 
8. Students should be trained to make worthy 
use of leisure. 
Another value worthy of consideration is the 
contribution of school social life to the happiness 
of the individual. The boy or girl who does not 
have any social life is usually unhappy—and is 
sometimes driven to unfortunate habits of 
thought and conduct. No one can attend the 
social functions of the students without noticing 
the interest, enthusiasm, and satisfaction they 
display. We have committed ourselves to 
‘‘worthy use of leisure’’ as one of the seven pri- 
mary objectives of secondary education. In 
“Cardinal Principles’? we have the following 
statement : 
Edueation should equip the individual to secure from his 
leisure recreation of body, mind, and spirit, and the en- 
richment and enlargement of his personality. 
This objective calls for the ability to utilize the com- 
mon means of enjoyment, such as music, art, literature, 
the drama, and social intercourse. One of the surest ways 
in which to prepare students worthily to utilize leisure 
in adult life is by guiding and directing their use of leisure 
in youth. The school should see that adequate social rec- 
reation is provided within the school and should encour- 
age proper agencies in the community. 
The school has a unique opportunity in this field be- 
cause it includes in its membership representatives from
-P-A-G-E-159
SOCIAL FUNCTIONS 133 
all classes of society, and consequently is able through 
social relationships to establish bonds of friendship and 
common understanding that cannot be furnished by other 
agencies. 
It is evident from the foregoing discussion that 
there is a real place in the program of the sec- 
ondary school for a well-planned, thoroughly ad- 
ministered social entertainment program, if the 
extra-curricular movement is to meet the needs 
of the students fully. 
Supervision of Social Functions. This part of 
the school’s program of activities will need close 
and constant supervision. The high school prin- 
cipal, except in a small institution, will not be 
able to give the matter the attention it needs to 
be successful. He will delegate the responsi- 
bility to a faculty member, in large high schools 
known as the director of social functions. In 
large schools it is important that this director 
be given adequate free time to do the work well. 
There can be no over-emphasis of this point. If 
any part of the extra-curricular program advo- 
cated in these pages is to succeed, there must be 
adequate supervision. It may and undoubtedly 
will cost more, but the end is worth the cost. 
The director of social functions should be sup- 
ported by a faculty committee known as the 
Social Committee. This committee considers
-P-A-G-E-160
134 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
general policies, rules and regulations, directing, 
through the director, the whole social program 
of the school. In junior high schools it is advis- 
able to have a student social committee codper- 
ate with the director in carrying out the social 
program. In the Latimer Junior High School, 
Pittsburgh, the student social committee is 
known as the Social Secretaries Club. Hach 
home room sends its secretary as its representa- 
tive to this organization. The result is that every 
room in the school is represented on the school 
social committee. 
The Social Secretaries Club meets regularly 
in the activities period, under the sponsorship of 
the director of social functions. The club initi- 
ates social features, helps to plan for all social 
functions, and aids in carrying out the details 
of these functions. Its plans must be approved 
by the faculty social committee. For the senior 
high school it may be better to have the regular 
social committee composed of members of both 
faculty and student body, as shown by the ex- 
perience of some schools where this method has 
been successfully tried. 
Time and Place for Social Functions. Many 
social functions, especially for small groups such 
as the home rooms and clubs, may be held in the 
regular activities period. Most of the social func- 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
  
SOCIAL FUNCTIONS 135 
tions, however, ought to be held after the regular 
school hours—at the close of school in the after- 
noon. 
The writer does not advocate social functions 
for junior high school students for evening 
hours. Both kinds of functions, afternoon and 
evening, have been tried, and the results have 
established the conclusion that junior high school 
students enjoy their social functions after school, 
if properly planned, just as much as they would 
in the evening hours, and the school is saved the 
added responsibility imposed by evening social 
activity. 
On the other hand many senior high school 
functions can and perhaps should be held during 
the evening hours. All social functions should 
be held in the school building. It is not advisable 
to permit school social functions in the name of 
the school to be held outside of the school build- 
ing. School banquets may be the exception to this 
rule, but even they should be held in the school 
building when the institution operates a cafeteria 
or lunch room. 
Nature of Social Programs. Home rooms and 
clubs are encouraged to have one or two parties 
each semester. Written requests for these par- 
ties must be submitted to the social director, 
together with the plans and program of enter-
-P-A-G-E-162
  136 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
tainment. The home-room teacher or club 
sponsors are then held responsible for the proper 
supervision of these affairs. The smaller units 
of the school are thus easily cared for. 
Class parties in both junior and senior high 
schools are organized on a larger basis. In the 
case of the junior high school the students work 
out their plans through the student social com- 
mittee, submitting them to the social committee 
of the faculty for approval. In the case of the 
joint student and faculty social committee, that 
body works out the plans in its own organiza- 
tion. 
Under any plan it is well to encourage stu- 
dents to take the initiative. When they are led 
to do so and given sufficient responsibility, the 
results are practically assured. Social affairs 
must be given plenty of publicity. This may be 
done through the art and printing departments. 
Students in the art classes, or in painting, deco- 
rating, and designing classes, produce better work 
when it is motivated by real purposes of this 
kind. Similarly, the boys in the printing depart- 
ments find satisfaction in preparing the pro- 
grams, invitations, and menu cards for these 
events. 
Every high school should have a social activi-
-P-A-G-E-163
SOCIAL FUNCTIONS 137 
ties orchestra prepared to play suitable music 
for all social affairs. It should be under the 
supervision of the regular school orchestra, in 
order that the right kind of music for dancing 
and entertainment may be secured. Students 
should be held responsible for the decorative 
effects desired for social events. Given the nec- 
essary incentive, they invariably produce origi- 
nal and appropriate results. 
The following social events are suggestive of 
the possibilities in this connection. Some are 
entirely suited to junior high school organiza- 
tions, others are adapted to the needs of both 
junior and senior high school student groups: 
1. The circus (for the junior high school). 
This is an event in connection with the annual 
Hallowe’en celebration. Every student in the 
school is encouraged to dress in costume. Prizes 
are awarded for the most distinctive, original, 
and humorous designs, as determined by an 
awarding committee before which the students 
parade in the assembly hall or gymnasium. A 
circus program is then put on by the students 
themselves. A typical program follows: 
Indoor Cireus (8B—7A—7B) 
1. Band (all instruments made in the tin shop). 
2. Tillie the Toiler’s Vacation.

2. Plays by the Dramatic Club of the school. 
If the school is a junior high school, it is a 
good plan to have the dramatic department of 
the senior high school visit the junior high 
school and entertain the students. 
8. Informal social hour after school—once 
weekly. 
This hour, adapted to either a junior or a 
senior high school, has become a popular source 
of pleasure to the students. It is an event which 
needs close supervision by a faculty and student 
committee, and should be strictly confined to the
-P-A-G-E-165
  
SOCIAL FUNCTIONS 139 
one hour, with attendance voluntary. Space for 
the meeting may usually be found in a gymna- 
sium, the lunch room, or available large rooms 
of other types. 
Entertainment for the social hour should. be 
varied to meet the interests of different groups. 
When sanctioned by the committees in charge, 
dancing may be included as an enjoyable feature 
of the program. The informal social hour has 
been most successful where properly introduced, 
and is a part of the extra-curricular program 
which may be recommended to practically any 
senior or junior high school. 
4. Motion-picture entertainments. 
Farewell parties to outgoing students. 
Picnics for all groups.

honor students, etc.

Entertainments may be built around such ac-

solo dancing, humorous readings, dialogues, min- 
strel shows, and vaudeville acts. The sponsor 
will be surprised at the originality and genius 
appearing in students actually given an oppor- 
tunity of developing themselves.  
-P-A-G-E-166
  140 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
Unquestionably many other forms of enter- 
tainment for these social functions may be sug- 
gested. The principal thing to be kept in mind 
is the ideal of wholesome recreation, plenty of 
it, under close supervision, coupled with enough 
freedom to stimulate initiative and responsi- 
bility. 
Rules Governing Social Functions. The follow- 
ing rules are suggestive of the type which may 
be used in junior high schools: 
1. All classes or clubs desiring to hold a func- 
tion in the school shall present to the 
director or chairman of the social commit- 
tee at least two weeks before the date of 
such function the time, the place, and the 
names of two teachers who have consented 
to act as sponsors. 
2. No function shall be held without the consent 
of the social director. 
3. Each club, society, class, or home room, is 
allowed two functions a year. 
4. All guests must be affiliated either with the 
faculty or the student body of the school. 
5. The amusements of the function must be of 
such a character as will entertain the en- 
tire group and assure interest for all.
-P-A-G-E-167
  
SOCIAL FUNCTIONS 141 
6. If the function is held after school, the clos- 
ing hours shall be not later than 6 o’clock; 
if held in the evening, the event should, if 
possible, be arranged for a Friday evening 
or the evening before a holiday, and the 
closing hour shall be 10 o’clock. 
7. A report of the function shall be made on a 
blank form provided for the purpose. It 
shall be presented to the social director or 
to the social committee chairman on the 
the school day immediately following 
the function. 
8. All functions held under the auspices of the 
school must be held in the school building. 
9. All social functions shall be under the direct 
supervision of the social director or the 
chairman of the social committee. 
For the senior high schools, the following rules 
are suggested: 
1. All social functions shall be under the direct 
supervision of the social director or the 
chairman of the social committee. 
2. All classes, clubs, or school organizations 
desiring to hold a function in the school 
shall present to the social director or so- 
cial chairman at least two weeks before 
the date of such function the time, place,
-P-A-G-E-168
  
142 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
and the names of faculty and parent 
sponsors. 
No more than two evening functions each 
semester, in addition to daytime functions, 
shall be permitted. 
All organization functions shall be chaper- 
oned by at least two faculty sponsors and 
two parents, except that class functions 
shall have at least four faculty sponsors 
and at least four parent sponsors. 
If functions are held at night, they shall, so 
far as possible, be held on Friday nights, 
or on evenings preceding holidays or vaca- 
tions, and shall begin not later than 8 
o’clock and close at 10:30. 
No one shall be admitted to any party, 
picnic, hike, or social function who is not 
at the time of such function a member of 
the present student body and a member of 
the organization giving the function. 
No students shall be admitted to evening 
functions after 8:15 o’clock. 
No students shall be permitted to leave a 
function before the closing time unless by 
special excuse from the class sponsor. 
The amusements of the function shall be 
such as will include the entire group and 
insure entertainment for all.

If dancing is permitted, correct positions, 
censored by the sponsors and parents, 
teachers, and students, are absolutely 
required, the aim being to develop grace 
and beauty. 
All music shall have the approval of the 
music department of the high school. 
Refreshments are to be simple and inexpen- 
sive. Stress is to be placed on the enter- 
tainment, decorations, and activities of the 
evening, rather than on the refreshments. 
Democratic participation on the part of all 
is expected and is to be encouraged. 
Failure to comply with the spirit of these 
regulations shall, at the option of the 
sponsors or principal, result in temporary 
or permanent suspension from all social 
functions.

    CHAPTER VIII 
HIGH SCHOOL PUBLICATIONS 
The Value of High School Publications. There 
are few activities in the high school affording so 
many opportunities for large numbers of stn- 
dents to participate as those centering about high 
school publications. Publications in themselves 
vary as to frequency of edition, character of 
material used, and purpose for which they are 
planned. In a large high school in which the 
students have many interests and in which the 
activities are varied and diversified, school pub- 
lications may become no small part of the extra- 
curricular program. Even in the smaller schools 
and junior high schools there are almost as 
many fields for school publications as there are 
fields of interest. Not only do the publications 
themselves vary in kind, but the methods of 
publication are different, so that, taking into 
consideration both the editorial, financial, and 
mechanical sides of the work, there are possibili- 
ties for participation by many students. In the 
production of one high school publication, it is 
144
-P-A-G-E-171
  HIGH SCHOOL PUBLICATIONS 145 
probable and desirable that the services of a 
large number of students will be required. This 
is especially true in the case of the editing of the 
high school newspaper, whether daily or weekly, 
for if such a publication is to be complete it must 
receive the contributions not only of editors, 
copy readers, and headline writers, but also of 
reporters representing every class, activity, and 
subdivision of the school. The more complete 
the news gathering force behind the publication, 
the more effective will be its contribution to the 
institution. In any high school there should be 
just as much opportunity for student participa- 
tion in the publications as there is a demand on 
the part of the students. The broadness of the 
field is such that students interested in writing, 
in newspaper work, in fiction, in athletics, in 
criticism, in social activities, and in art may 
readily find an outlet for their efforts on the 
editorial side, while those interested in business 
and methods of advertising may find a similar 
outlet on the financial side and, in cases where 
the high school possesses a printing department, 
those interested in the mechanical details of 
printing are amply cared for in the actual pub- 
lication of the journals themselves. 
The school publication is to the school com- 
munity what the daily newspaper or magazine
-P-A-G-E-172
  146 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
is to the larger community of life. Just as the 
daily newspaper or magazine serves a me- 
dium for the exchange of ideas and for the 
distribution of news, so the high school publica- 
tion performs a like service for the students in 
the high school. The value of a high school 
publication as a news medium is in direct propor- 
tion to the frequency in which it appears. A 
monthly journal has, of course, less value as a 
distributing agent for news than a weekly paper 
and even a weekly paper falls short of the daily 
paper in this field of service. A high school with 
a large student body may find great opportuni- 
ties in the field of publications for acquainting 
its students with the events, activities, and prob- 
lems of its life from day to day. Through the 
medium of high school publications, the admin- 
istrative department of the school may keep the 
student informed as to the mechanical details 
of everyday school life. The departments of in- 
struction may reach the student in a similar way, 
and the faculty or supervisors are afforded a 
better chance of conveying whatever informa- 
tion they have to offer the student body to every 
student in the school. There are always students 
who read the publications from cover to cover, 
but who are negligent in their reference to bulle- 
tin boards or the announcements made from time
-P-A-G-E-173
  HIGH SCHOOL PUBLICATIONS 147 
to time in class. While it is not intended to 
over-emphasize the news value of high school 
publications, it should be recognized at the same 
time that such a value does exist, and that a high 
school which is failing to make use of this op- 
portunity is neglecting one of the most valuable 
points of student contact. 
Of equal importance to the school is the oppor- 
tunity afforded by school publications for the 
interchange of ideas and the expression of stu- 
dent opinion in their columns. During the high 
school age students are doing a great deal of 
thinking and as a rule they yearn for some means 
of expressing those thoughts. Where a system 
of high school publication is well organized, they 
have their chance to accomplish this aim in some 
measure. It is surprising how much instructive 
criticism may be done in the columns of high 
school publications by the students themselves 
who feel that when they are writing for these 
journals they are actually doing something 
worth while. Pupils will express themselves on 
all phases of student conduct, of school manage- 
ment, of athletic relations, and of every type of 
activity in which they play a part. They will 
not confine themselves only to the immediate 
field of the school world in which they are liv- 
ing. They will go beyond that field and will
-P-A-G-E-174
    148 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
contribute discussions dealing with political and 
social life in the community around them. The 
value of these discussions and the thing they 
represent to the school and to the community 
and to the students themselves cannot be over- 
estimated. 
School publications, rightly conducted, tend 
to interest the student in the production of lit- 
erary work. There should be in every school 
opportunity for the recognition of literary ac- 
tivity on the part of the student and when this 
recognition is provided, and an opportunity is 
given for the better class of literary work to 
appear in printed form, an incentive is supplied 
which usually results in more and better writ- 
ing. Another beneficial result of well conducted 
school publications not to be overlooked is the 
impression they make upon the community out- 
side the school, upon the parents of the students, 
upon other high schools, and other institutions. 
High schools have come to know each other very 
largely through the exchange of publications, 
and the spirit of a school is often truthfully re- 
flected in the publications it sends out. Good 
publications stimulate an interest on the part of 
the community and the high school and often 
come to the attention of those who would other- 
wise give no notice to the efforts and activities
-P-A-G-E-175
  HIGH SCHOOL PUBLICATIONS 149 
of the school. Moreover, the alumni of the in- 
stitution are always interested in the activities 
““back in school,’’ and publications are useful 
in informing them of the progress that has 
been made since their graduation. An effort 
should be made by those in charge of high school 
publications to build up a_ subscription list 
among the alumni, for school people ought to 
recognize the value of good will on the part of 
the alumni who have gone from the school walls. 
A school should regard as one of its first duties 
the training of the student in the use of Eng- 
lish. Graduates of high school ought to be able 
to write good clear English, fully explaining 
whatever thoughts they may have, yet concise, 
to the point, and unburdened by any ornate style. 
Nothing produces this result so much as train- 
ing in the writing of news stories, hence it is true 
that the more students who are encouraged to 
act as reporters to high school publications, the 
more widespread will be the use of effective 
English. Writing for high school publications 
gives the student practical outlet for the theories 
he is taught in the classroom. When the pub- 
lications are conducted and supervised by per- 
sons capable of doing that kind of work, much 
good can be accomplished in training to write. 
Usually there is a close relationship between the  
-P-A-G-E-176
    150 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
English department and publications. This re- 
lationship should be fostered because of the 
direct value it represents to the student. Once 
again it is important to note that a limited 
policy in the field of high school publications af- 
fords but a limited opportunity for development, 
whereas a broad use of publications presents a 
wide opportunity for growth in the right di- 
rection in so far as English is concerned. 
With the growth of newspapers and journal- 
ism generally in the United States has come 
a new appreciation of writing as a profession. 
It is gradually being recognized as one of the 
most influential professions in modern life. 
Newspapers go into every home. They have a 
pronounced effect on the thinking and activity 
of every citizen. This influence begins to op- 
erate just as early as the individual begins to 
read. There is more power in the press to sway 
public opinion than there is in perhaps any other 
one agency of modern civilization. If the educa- 
tional system recognizes this influence, it will 
make it its business to train the right kind of 
persons in whose hands the future of journalism 
is to rest. At the present time there are few 
means for accomplishing this outside of the 
fields of amateur journalism in our high schools 
and colleges. Guided by right-minded super-
-P-A-G-E-177
HIGH SCHOOL PUBLICATIONS 151 
vision, high school publications may be the 
means of inducing capable, earnest, and con- 
scientious young people to enter the field of 
journalism with all of the opportunities and ad- 
vantages it has to offer. 
The usefulness of high school publications as 
training for this type of work is not confined to 
the editorial side, but may be felt as well in the 
field of advertising. Student editors and as- 
sistants of publications may learn the rudiments 
of advertising and may learn the elements of fair 
play in business just as effectively through the 
work they do in an amateur way as through the 
theoretical instruction of a classroom. The fu- 
ture will find many high school graduates in the 
field of journalism on the business side. Equally 
true is it that the boys working on the printing 
end of high school publications will find valuable 
aid in their preparation for their chosen trades. 
And then there is the joy which comes from the 
production of something worth while—something 
that is more than a mere laboratory problem— 
something that goes beyond the walls of the shop 
in which such effort is expended. 
Kinds of High School Publications. High school 
publications in newspaper form possess a value 
not found in those in magazine form. The high 
school newspaper whether published weekly or 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  152 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
daily is bound to attract a greater interest on the 
part of the students because its very nature re- 
quires a greater amount of work on the part of 
each. If a publication appears monthly the stu- 
dents in charge of the work are not required to 
devote so much time to the task as they would 
be were they actively engaged in the publica- 
tion of something appearing daily, or even 
weekly. The high school publication should not 
be in the form of a newspaper unless it possess 
the characteristics of a newspaper, and the 
newspaper is not published monthly. It is pub- 
lished daily, as a rule, or at least weekly. When 
the high school newspaper does have the char- 
acteristics of a real newspaper, it gives the stu- 
dents opportunities such as no other form of 
publication would provide. Whether or not it 
should appear daily or weekly depends largely 
on the size of the school, on the amount of talent 
available, on the amount of time provided for its 
publication, and on the amount of financial sup- 
port it may reasonably expect to enjoy. It is 
obvious that any daily paper in the high school 
will require the constant attention of capable 
supervisors both on the editorial and mechanical 
sides. The high school which is equipped to take 
eare of the printing of its own publications is
-P-A-G-E-179
  HIGH SCHOOL PUBLICATIONS 153 
much better prepared for a daily paper than is 
the high school relying upon outside assistance, 
both in the matter of speed in production and 
in the matter of expense. 
The daily newspaper in the high school should 
be no larger than is necessary to set forth the 
news and events of the day adequately. Its size 
can quickly be decided by a conference between 
those who are to handle the editorial side and 
those in charge of the printing shop. The print- 
ing shop should bear in mind its own limitations 
and the amount of time necessary to set up and 
print a paper of sufficient size and circulation to 
meet the needs of the school, and those interested 
editorially should carefully determine what the 
news needs of the school are likely to be from day 
to day. The correct size of such a paper can be 
more properly determined after one or two 
trials than by consideration of any set rules. 
There must be a basis for the production of such 
a paper, however, and this basis must take into 
consideration ample provision for the division of 
responsibility among those interested in produc- 
ing the paper. A daily activities period is al- 
most indispensable if a school is to publish a 
daily paper. This activities period should come 
in the morning and at that time the staff of the
-P-A-G-E-180
  154 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
paper should meet. Under an organization 
similar to that of the daily newspaper and di- 
rected by the efforts of a supervisor, all news 
of the day and all of the material intended for 
publication should be carefully gone over, type- 
written, and edited by the close of the period, 
at which time it should be delivered to the print- 
ing department. Usually the printing depart- 
ment may have its schedule of work so arranged 
that it can take prompt hold of the material 
sent to it and set up the newspaper with the 
least possible loss of time. When the activities 
period comes in the morning, certain students 
may be delegated to read the proof of the paper 
during the lunch hour. Following the lunch pe- 
riod the boys in the printing shop may make the 
necessary changes indicated by the proof read- 
ers and then the paper is ready to be set on the 
press. The circulation division of the students 
interested in publications may so arrange its 
program each day as to care for the distribu- 
tion of the papers to home rooms as soon as it 
is printed or at the close of school. It may 
readily be seen that unless the daily program of 
the students interested in publications has some 
flexibility it is difficult to care for a daily paper. 
It may also be seen that to throw the same bur- 
den of work on each student day after day is to
-P-A-G-E-181
  
HIGH SCHOOL PUBLICATIONS 155 
place an unwise emphasis on one form of ac- 
tivity to the neglect of other activities or even 
of school work. Therefore it is advisable that 
as many students as possible be interested in 
the publication of such a daily paper and that 
the responsibility for its appearance each day 
be divided among these students. The organi- 
zation for producing the daily paper will be dis- 
cussed later. 
For the high school of average size, and for 
the junior high school, the publication of a 
weekly newspaper is more advantageous. Al- 
though it does not afford the same opportuni- 
ties for intensive training in journalism, it pos- 
sesses many advantages on the side of accuracy 
and care in the collection and preparation of 
material. The weekly newspaper may have the 
same staff organization as the daily paper and 
may also utilize the activities period. The prin- 
cipal difference lies in the fact that the students 
working on the weekly paper have more time 
at their disposal, consequently, a higher and 
more selective grade of writing should be ex- 
pected in such a paper, and the supervisor has 
more time in which to check up and encourage 
the efforts of the students. The limitations of 
size which must be rigidly respected in the case 
of daily newspapers do not affect the weekly  
-P-A-G-E-182
  156 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
paper to the same extent. There is, and should 
be, more room for contributions by students, for 
editorials, for criticism, and for literary ability 
in the pages of the weekly than there is in the 
daily. When there is doubt as to the advisabil- 
ity of publishing a daily paper, it is advisable 
to decide in favor of a well-rounded and well- 
edited weekly newspaper rather than an uncer- 
tain and poorly edited daily paper. 
The monthly journal should be the principal 
medium in the high school for the expression 
of student opinion and for the development of 
literary ability. It should leave the field of news 
to the weekly or daily newspaper and should 
concern itself primarily with the more literary 
side of life in the high school. It is the oppor- 
tunity for students to practice writing their 
opinions of various subjects in which they are 
interested, and it is the opportunity for stu- 
dents with literary tastes to learn to express 
themselves in a way acceptable for publication. 
The supervisor of the monthly paper should ex- 
pect and demand a high type of workmanship on 
the part of the students taking part in its pro- 
duction. This means that the monthly journal 
should be a matter of pride on the part of the 
students and should reflect the best of their 
capabilities. The monthly journal affords an
-P-A-G-E-183
HIGH SCHOOL PUBLICATIONS 157 
opportunity for contacts with the alumni of 
the school and for the expression of student 
policy, of student spirit, and of school contacts 
in the community. The monthly journal should 
also be considered as an outlet for humor on 
the part of the students. This is a feature which 
may be depended upon to liven it up and add to 
its interest. It should also be remembered that 
there is room in the field of publications for 
competition in the art departments. The 
monthly journal ought to have attractive covers, 
cuts, and designs. These should be prepared 
in the art department or by the art clubs of 
the school. It is just as true that the ambitions 
of students in art will be supported by an oppor- 
tunity for real expression as it is that the in- 
terests of those of literary inclinations will be 
stimulated by this means. 
The high school annual has become almost a 
standard form of publication in the high schools 
of the United States. In this form of publica- 
tion, there is more opportunity for real artistic 
expression on the part of the student body than 
there is in the other forms. High school annuals 
are getting better from year to year. The most 
helpful advice that may be given to those inter- 
ested in producing the annual is that they begin 
their work with a good organization and that 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  158 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
they obtain as many copies of these annuals as 
possible and select from them what in their opin- 
ion are the most desirable features. 
For the students who are not interested pri- 
marily in regular journalism or high school 
daily, weekly, or monthly publications, there is 
another form of activity in the production of 
special publications. This field includes pro- 
grams for special events, folders designed for 
particular occasions, propaganda of various 
kinds in the interest of school activities, souvenir 
editions proposed as part of special events, and 
all publications planned with a particular rather 
than a general purpose in mind. The high- 
school handbook is taking a prominent place in 
this field.t 
Organization of High School Publications. In 
putting into effect a publications program as a 
part of the extra-curricular activity of the high 
school, it is important to bear in mind the neces- 
sity for adequate working space. Those in 
charge should provide a room equipped for edi- 
torial purposes. In the case of a daily high 
school newspaper, such a room is almost indis- 
pensable. The room should contain plenty of 
tables or desks at which the students may work 
so that there is the least possible loss of time.

  HIGH SCHOOL PUBLICATIONS 159 
Pupils should be able to go during free moments 
directly to the place provided for them for the 
purpose of working on the publications with 
which they are connected. 
In arranging for the plan of such a room, it 
would not be inadvisable to pay a visit to a 
newspaper office. There the best arrangement 
of editorial desks and tables may be observed. 
Essential to the equipment of such a room is one 
table or desk at which the news editor and his 
assistants may sit. Preferably this table should 
be in the form of a semicircle with the editor’s 
chair directly in the middle, facing the seats of 
his assistants or copy readers. In addition to 
this there should be a number of small tables 
equipped with typewriters. 
Supervisors of high school publications will 
find that work may be more effectively done 
when typewritten copy is demanded. From the 
very beginning, high school publications should 
insist upon typewritten copy. It is almost fun- 
damental to accuracy, which is one of the pri- 
mary rules of good journalism. 
In the publications room there should also be 
a bookcase or set of files in which letters, clip- 
pings from newspapers and journals, and ma- 
terial reserved for future use may be kept. It is 
also advisable to have the room equipped with
-P-A-G-E-186
    160 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
a telephone. The more nearly this room is made 
to resemble an actual newspaper office, the more 
likely is it that the publications will reflect the 
true newspaper spirit. 
The staff organization suggested here is, with 
slight variations, applicable to a daily and 
weekly newspaper. It will seem at first that too 
many offices are listed in this organization, but 
for comprehensive, careful and worth-while edit- 
ing, it is necessary that a far-reaching and 
thorough staff be provided. 
The two chief figures in this staff are the man- 
aging editor and the news editor. The news 
editor is perhaps the more important of the two 
figures, because upon his initiative and daily con- 
tact with the student body depends the energy 
and enthusiasm of the paper as a news medium. 
The news editor is in direct charge of a staff 
consisting of associate editors, assistant editors, 
copy readers, and reporters. The news editor 
acts personally as the head of this staff. Hach 
day, in the activities period, he takes charge 
of the office and directs his associates as to 
their duties. He makes assignments to the re- 
porters, instructing them where to go for news, 
what events to cover, and what stories to write 
up. He determines the length of the story and 
the prominence of its position in the paper.
-P-A-G-E-187
  HIGH SCHOOL PUBLICATIONS 161 
The reporters look to him each day for their 
assignments and report to him when they have 
finished the work. The news editor should be a 
student who is selected primarily for his ability 
as a keen observer of events as well as for his 
ability in the use of English. In addition to 
making the assignments and looking over the 
work done, he should keep well informed in all 
the events of the school, so that nothing of im- 
portance is overlooked. 
In a school possessing a daily newspaper, it 
may readily be seen that the news editor is an 
important figure and, so great is the work to be 
done from day to day, it is important that the 
news editor have assistance. It is advisable to 
entrust each assistant editor with a certain field 
of activity. For example, one assistant editor 
may be in charge of covering social activities of 
the school; another should devote his attention 
to the jokes and humor of the newspaper; a 
third should be responsible for the activities of 
the various school clubs, while the fourth as- 
sistant news editor should be responsible for 
publicity on school assemblies. Reporters work- 
ing in either of these fields should hand in their 
stories to the news editor, who should then turn 
them over to the proper assistant. The assistant 
will read the story, make any corrections neces- 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  162 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
sary, and decide whether or not the event has 
been adequately covered. After the news edi- 
tor and his assistants have looked at the news 
story, they should pass it on to the copy reader, 
whose business it is to examine the story for 
any possible defects in English or in construc- 
tion. He writes a suitable head line and the ar- 
ticle is then ready for the printer. Much de- 
pends upon the ability of the assistant news edi- 
tors. The editor in charge of assembly should 
make it his business to see that the student body 
is well informed as to all assemblies, both past 
and future. He should look up information on 
programs, on speakers expecting to visit the 
school, and upon all of the side lights and char- 
acteristics of the school assembly. Such a stu- 
dent developed properly may become a useful as- 
set in making assembly programs pleasing and 
worth while. 
While the foregoing arrangement is satis- 
factory for covering the activities indicated, 
reporting of events of general school interest 
must not be overlooked. When the students have 
shown ability as reporters, they should be en- 
trusted with the writing up of more important 
school events. They should be directly respon- 
sible to the news editor rather than to any of 
the assistant editors.
-P-A-G-E-189
  HIGH SCHOOL PUBLICATIONS 163 
Working side by side with the news editor 
should be the managing editor, in whose hands 
lies the responsibility for the editorials appear- 
ing in the paper and for the relations of the 
paper with other school activities and with the 
supervisory members of the faculty. 
The managing editor should direct the edito- 
rial policy of the paper. He should have as his 
assistants two or three editorial writers, stu- 
dents who devote their time to consideration of 
those things of interest to the entire student body 
and who endeavor to interpret those things, as 
well as the news of the school, on the editorial 
pages. They should write their editorials during 
the activities period, passing them on to the man- 
aging editor for any possible correction and for 
approval. The managing editor should also be 
in close contact with the business side, repre- 
senting the editorial side in all relations of a 
business nature. The circulation manager and 
his assistants should be responsible to him. 
Another important member of the high school 
publication staff is the sporting editor, who per- 
forms the duties usually pertaining to the holder 
of this title. The sporting editor as a rule has 
his own reporters and assistants, reads and cor- 
rects his own stories, and writes his own head- 
lines. The sporting editor and his assistants 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  164 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
may be drawn from that class of students dis- 
playing a special interest in athletics. 
An office that should not be overlooked in the 
organization of a high school publication is that 
of librarian or files editor, the person to whom 
the keeping of all records and memorandums 
is entrusted. He should spend all his time 
not used in caring for this material in preparing 
information such as is used in any newspaper 
morgue. If he displays an enthusiasm in his 
work this department may perform a valuable 
service to the publication. 
Working with the librarian should be an ex- 
change editor, whose business it is to receive the 
publications of other high schools and to exam- 
ine them for suggestions of possible value to his 
own publication. If he is observing, this student 
may find material always welcome to the editor. 
Representing a different form of activity is 
the circulation manager and those helping him. 
It is the duty of this student to devise and main- 
tain a system for the distribution of the news- 
paper as it appears to the student body and 
faculty. In the case of a daily newspaper, the 
circulation system must be so organized that de- 
livery may be made with facility to all parts of 
the school as soon as the sheet comes from the 
press.
-P-A-G-E-191
  
HIGH SCHOOL PUBLICATIONS 165 
The faculty members who have been appointed 
by the principal to supervise the high school pub- 
lications should be constantly codperating and 
working with this staff. They will find constant 
problems with which to help the members of the 
staff, and ample opportunity to make sugges- 
tions of value to the publications of the school. 
It is especially important that a certain amount 
of censorship be exercised for the purpose of 
safeguarding the interests both of the school 
and the students. There is always the possi- 
bility that unwelcome material of some sort may 
find its way into print. 
Selection of the Staff. Supervisors will find as 
a rule a large number of boys and girls in the 
student body eager to be used in the publication 
of a daily or weekly newspaper. Usually the 
most satisfactory results may be obtained from 
a system which is more or less competitive. 
During the years which the student spends in 
high school, he should be given an opportunity 
to work his way upward from the reporting busi- 
ness of the staff to that of editor. Certainly 
the leading positions should be filled on the basis 
of ability and character if the paper is to be a 
success. Students may profitably spend a year 
or two as reporters before being promoted to 
any position of greater responsibility. It will
-P-A-G-E-192
    166 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
be found that a student who serves a year or 
more as a reporter may acquire a wide amount 
of information concerning the school as a whole, 
as well as considerable ability as a writer. It 
should be borne in mind at all times that one of 
the real aims in this form of activity is to train 
the students in expression and in the use of Eng- 
lish, and the supervisor should realize that he 
enjoys a rare opportunity to help those in his 
charge. 
It has already been pointed out that the or- 
ganization described above applies as well to a 
weekly high school paper as to a daily. The 
added size of the weekly paper gives the students 
plenty of opportunity to utilize all their free ac- 
tivity periods for this work. For a monthly 
high school journal, however, such an extensive 
organization is not necessary. As pointed out 
before, a monthly school journal should be more 
literary and editorial in character. 
To a great extent the size of the staff depends 
upon the broadness of the field covered by the 
monthly journal. It is not necessary to have 
a large group of reporters and copy readers. As 
a rule the editor and the managing editor are 
able to take care of the details of publication 
with, of course, the help of several assistants. 
The managing editor should have charge of the
-P-A-G-E-193
  HIGH SCHOOL PUBLICATIONS 167 
editorial policy of the paper, should represent 
it in dealings with outside interests, and should 
serve as an agent between the business and edi- 
torial staffs. He should work with the super- 
visor of the journal at all times. The editor and 
his assistants should devote their time to the 
selection and preparation of material for each 
edition. If they are properly coached in this 
work and are interested in the journal, there is a 
large field for activity on their part. Persons 
not in any way officially connected with the 
journal may be encouraged to write for it, and 
all students ‘should be made to feel that they 
have in the journal a medium of expression and 
that what they contribute to it will be welcome. 
While the managing editor, the editor, and his 
assistants take care of the greater part of the 
material going into the editorial end of the 
journal, it is advisable to have special editors 
devoting their time to such fields as jokes and 
humor, exchanges, and alumni news. As pointed 
out before, much of the responsibility for keep- 
ing the monthly journal ‘‘alive’’ rests on the 
shoulders of the ‘‘jokes and humor’’ editor. 
As indicated by his title, the alumni editor 
has the responsibility of maintaining contacts 
with those who have graduated. Properly de- 
veloped, this would be a feature of great inter-
-P-A-G-E-194
  168 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
est to the alumni and their support would aid in 
making the monthly journal profitable. As in 
the case of the weekly paper, there is a great 
need for proper preservation of records and ex- 
changes, and members of the staff should take 
care of this subject through the direction of the 
exchange editor. 
The artistic side of journalism ought not to 
be overlooked in the monthly journal. An art 
editor with assistants should devote his time to 
procuring the best kind of illustrations, car- 
toons, and drawings for publication in the jour- 
nal. By making use of the talent in the art 
club and in the regular art department of the 
school, this editor can contribute a great deal 
to the journal. If possible, the staff of the 
monthly journal should be provided with a room 
in which to work. They should use their free 
activities periods so as not to conflict with the 
activities of the staff publishing the weekly or 
daily journal. What has been said regarding 
the selection of the staff of the daily or weekly 
paper applies equally well in the case of the 
monthly journal. 
It has been found advisable to make use of the 
staff of the monthly journal, as far as possible, 
in preparing the high school annual. Because 
of their experience in taking care of the needs

of the monthly and because of their acquaintance 
with the school, these students are better quali- 
fied than any others for the work. The high 
school annual, from the editorial side, is some- 
thing which may be worked on throughout the 
entire year; and those directing the policies of 
the monthly journal ought to bear in mind the 
annual’s needs at all times, reserving for it that 
material which seems better fitted for the annual 
than for monthly use. Of course, certain stu- 
dents should be designated as the editors and 
managers of the various departments involved 
in the annual. It is especially important that 
an editor in chief be appointed or selected: this 
individual to devote most of his attention to the 
work. At the beginning of the year the annual 
staff should be organized, mapping out its pro- 
gram so that any undue accumulation of work 
at any one time may be avoided. 
The problems connected with the high school 
annual are more specific than general. The high 
school annual is not a publication in a journal- 
istic sense. It is rather a special compilation 
of historic and current material of particular in- 
terest to a particular group. The editor in chief, 
of whom we have spoken, ought to get a bird’s- 
eye view of the entire field to be covered in the 
publication and then take whatever steps are
-P-A-G-E-196
  
  170 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
necessary to assign individual parts of the work 
to those on his staff. He will have to take care- 
ful consideration of the personals to be included 
in the annual, the class sketches, general his- 
torical material dealing with the entire school, 
records of athletic events, and all of the varied 
write-ups dealing with clubs, organizations, and 
societies wishing to be recognized in the publica- 
tion. 
Working with the editor in chief, a managing 
editor should be appointed whose duties relate 
more particularly to the accumulation of such 
material as individual pictures of the students 
in the class publishing the annual, photographs 
of all groups to be included, and the various 
cuts and illustrations making up the artistic side 
of the book. He should generally supervise the 
relation of the publication to outside interests 
and should be in constant touch with the busi- 
ness side. 
Financing High School Publications. In connec- 
tion with the subject of financing high school 
publications, we wish to say a few words dealing 
with subscriptions and advertising. Experience 
seems to show that in almost every case the 
high school publication finds itself forced to 
rely, at least in part, on advertising for financial 
support. In the average high school there is
-P-A-G-E-197
  HIGH SCHOOL PUBLICATIONS 171 
no reason why the student should not seek, and 
deserve, the support of local merchants in this 
field. The advertising, however, should be 
closely supervised by some responsible member 
of the faculty who is able to direct the students 
in their solicitation and take whatever steps are 
necessary to prevent any commercialism from 
creeping in. In most communities the high school 
student body is a fairly respectable portion of 
the buying public and, in return for the good 
will of this group, merchants should be willing to 
assist students in their journalistic enterprises. 
To say, however, that all high school advertising 
pays is to ignore the real facts. In many in- 
stances the merchant cannot expect a positive 
financial return for the money he invests in high 
school advertising and this is a fact which those 
in charge of high school publications should al- 
ways bear in mind. 
Whenever possible, the business managers of 
high school publications should put into effect a 
plan which makes every student in the school a 
subscriber and contributor to the expense of 
publication. In some institutions this is ar- 
ranged by having the student pay, at the begin- 
ning of the year, a sum sufficient to cover his 
subscription to all of the publications. When 
this is made obligatory on the student body, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
172 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
result is that each publication has a complete 
subscription list to start with and is assured of 
a certain financial background upon which to 
plan its year’s program. Under such an ar- 
rangement the students receive their publica- 
tions free through a system of free distribution. 
It will be found that where this is adopted there 
is much less need for relying upon advertising 
than there is in schools struggling along with 
subscription drives. 
The fee usually charged to include such pub- 
lications as the daily, weekly or monthly jour- 
nals, and the annual is ordinarily referred to as 
the ‘‘student activities fee.’’ It should be de- 
termined upon in accordance with the amount to 
be allotted per student to each publication. As 
a rule the ‘‘student activities fee’’ includes other 
activities in need of financing. A certain amount 
of the budget made up from this source should, 
for example, go to the school dramatics. If 
enough is allotted to meet approximately the 
cost of the senior play, for instance, each stu- 
dent should be entitled to two tickets, which he 
would receive free as a contributor to the ‘‘stu- 
dent activities fee.’’ When this is worked out, 
those in charge ought to bear in mind the needs 
of all activities. 
In high schools which recognize the value of
-P-A-G-E-199
  HIGH SCHOOL PUBLICATIONS 173 
maintaining contacts with the alumni, school 
publications establish an alumni rate and an ef- 
fort is made to secure their subscriptions. The 
publications should have a subscription rate, of 
course, whether financed on the ‘‘student activ- 
ities fee’’ basis or not, so as to care for those 
not contributing to this income. 
Some high schools find it possible to support 
weekly or monthly journals through the sub- 
scriptions of students alone, without any neces- 
sity of hunting for advertising. In schools pos- 
sessing their own printing plants, excellent pub- 
lications may be issued, entirely free from de- 
pendence upon outside support. This form of 
school paper publication is highly commendable, 
and the school which has a printing plant with 
facilities for doing the work should certainly 
not fail to capitalize such an opportunity.

CHAPTER IX 
GUIDANCE 
Guidance as an extra-curricular activity has 
become so important in the last few years that 
it would be quite impossible to treat the subject 
adequately in one chapter of a book. It will be 
the purpose of the author to point out just a 
few of the main features of a guidance program 
in the secondary schools. 
Guidance a Necessity in Secondary Schools. The 
very nature of a modern junior or senior high 
school makes it imperative to adopt some sys- 
tem of guidance. We are committed to differen- 
tiated curricula, promotion by subject, homo- 
geneous grouping or at least a recognition of in- 
dividual differences, exploratory opportunity, 
an extra-curricular program, pre-vocational and 
vocational choice, and other features which make 
guidance one of the most important undertak- 
ings in the school. 
Administration of Guidance. The guidance pro- 
gram has grown so rapidly that it has been 
found necessary to create the office of guidance 
175
-P-A-G-E-202
  176 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
director or vocational and educational counselor 
in the high school, so that the work may be prop- 
erly administered and supervised. 
These counselors are given free time for this 
work, the amount depending on the size of the 
school. Some of them give all of their time 
to supervision of the guidance program. In 
recognition of the value and importance of their 
work, such counselors (there is one in every 
junior, junior-senior, and senior high school in 
some cities) are paid more than classroom teach- 
ers. Some of the large high schools in the United 
States employ separate counselors for the boys 
and girls. Every home-room teacher, by the very 
nature of the work, becomes an assistant in the 
guidance program of the school. 
Guidance in the Junior High School 
Instructional Guidance. In some junior high 
schools instructional guidance is carried on by 
the aid of Life Career Clubs in the seventh 
grades and in connection with the general school 
social science course in the ninth grade. In other 
junior high schools a regular guidance period 
is set aside once each week for instructional pur- 
poses. This arrangement makes it possible to 
interpret to the pupil the experiences of school 
life in terms of their vocational value from the

point of view of life outside of the school. It 
furnishes, before courses are selected, the oppor- 
tunity to study the various curricula of the 
school, the contents of each, the educational out- 
lets of each, and the vocational fields toward 
which each course points. In the upper grades 
of the junior high school, further study of occu- 
pations is made in occupational civics. A study 
is also made of the opportunities afforded by 
further training in the senior high school, in 
colleges and universities, and in trade schools. 
Life Career Clubs have been a distinctive fea- 
ture of the guidance program in some of the 
junior high schools. 
These clubs were organized and directed by 
the vocational counselor. They met once each 
week in the activities period, illustrating in an- 
other way the value of this period as a part of 
the daily program. 
Junior high school students are afforded a 
most excellent opportunity for instructional 
guidance in the general social science course of 
the ninth year. One entire semester, four or five 
periods per week, is devoted to regular instruc- 
tion and intensified study in vocational and edu- 
cational guidance. This work is preceded in the 
first semester of the ninth year general social 
science course by a study of economic civics. A 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
  178 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
distinct value inherent in these courses lies in 
the fact that they give the students an apprecia- 
tion of the elementary economic and social prin- 
ciples affecting and controlling the life of the 
individual. They develop an appreciation of the 
dignity of work. They point out the possibili- 
ties of service, the advantages and rewards of 
vocations of every kind, as well as the opportuni- 
ties involved in the higher fields of learning. 
From the standpoint of guidance, the service 
thus rendered to the student is invaluable. 
Advisory Guidance. No one should underesti- 
mate the difficulty of establishing and maintain- 
ing a successful advisory guidance program. In- 
dividual differences in children, classification of 
students, try-out opportunities, and choice of 
courses are some of the elements entering into 
this phase of the work. Advisory guidance 
means individual contact. In large junior high 
schools this may be accomplished only through 
the codperation and interest of the whole faculty. 
If the counselor is to proceed wisely and effec- 
tively in each case, he must have assistance from 
the home-room teacher as well as from the class- 
room teachers, the club directors, the student- 
government director, the social director, the 
school visitor, and others who see the student in 
different relations and aspects.
-P-A-G-E-207
  GUIDANCE 179 
In addition to the information gleaned from 
these sources, the counselor should be familiar 
to a certain extent with the history of the child. 
This he must accomplish through visits, confer- 
ences with the parents, talks with the child, intel- 
ligence and achievement tests, teachers’ esti- 
mates, and other direct and indirect processes. 
Classification of Students. Homogeneous group- 
ing of junior high school pupils is receiving 
marked attention all over the country. We do 
not care to enter into a discussion of this ques- 
tion here except to say that through five years of 
experience with homogeneous grouping we have 
become enthusiastic about its advantages. The 
advantages of homogeneous grouping, briefly 
stated, are: 
1. Each student is given the opportunity to 
develop as far as the school can aid in his 
development. 
2. Teaching effort is economized. 
3. Larger opportunity is given to the bright 
student. 
4. The slower student is aided in a fuller ex- 
pression of his intellectual life. 
5. The percentage of failures in each grade 
is reduced. 
6. Mutual stimulation is given. 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  180 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
7. The progress of the group is made regular 
and constant. 
8. Individual differences in children are recog- 
nized. 
The system is naturally closely associated with 
the guidance program. The counselor or his as- 
sistants must give the tests, be responsible for 
the follow-up work, and otherwise assist in the 
administration of the system. 
Try-out Opportunities. One of the distinctive 
features of junior high school work is its avowed 
purpose to discover the aptitudes, abilities, and 
interests of children. This means that try-out 
courses and try-out opportunities ought to be 
established in every phase of the work, espe- 
cially during the first two years. The general 
and industrial shops of the school afford an op- 
portunity to discover latent interests and capac- 
ities in industrial lines. 
In the extra-curricular activities there is a 
chance to discover genius, leadership, and partic- 
ular interests on the part of the students. In 
the regular school program there must be try- 
out opportunity in courses, in subjects, and in 
general tendencies. In this try-out process 
guidance in some of its finest aspects may be 
used to great advantage.
-P-A-G-E-209
GUIDANCE 181 
Report- or Home-Room Teachers’ Conferences. 
These conferences form an invaluable part of 
the program and are of great assistance to the 
counselor. As stated before, one activities period 
each week is set apart for individual or group 
conferences with the class. It is a time when the 
teacher may come into close personal contact 
with the individual student, possibly finding out 
something about his home influence, personal 
habits, ambitions, difficulties, and problems. A 
discussion of educational and vocational plans 
takes place which, in the school where the student 
body is so large that it handicaps the counselor 
in his efforts to give individual attention to all 
student needs, gives an opportunity for personal 
guidance work not otherwise obtained. 
Counselors’ Visits to Contributing Elementary 
Schools. The counselor should visit the contrib- 
uting elementary schools to meet the students in 
their natural environment before they enter the 
junior high school. He will tell them about the 
main features of the junior high school, give 
them intelligence tests used for classification 
purposes, and take what steps are necessary to 
prepare them for a happy and enthusiastic en- 
trance into the junior high school. 
Counselors’ Conferences. The counselor should 
hold many group conferences with the students
-P-A-G-E-210
a ee a ee ee ee ee 
182 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
on the subject of future educational or voca- 
tional plans. As differentiation of courses be- 
gins at the opening of the eighth grade in a 
junior high school, he should meet the second 
semester seventh-grade students in group con- 
ferences in order to explain the courses and give 
them complete information on the subject. His 
work involves the holding of numerous personal 
conferences with the student, bringing up such 
subjects as future careers, truancy, delinquency, 
failure, quitting school, and matters of attitude 
and behavior. He should allow himself time to 
arrange conferences with parents. 
These few remarks about guidance in the jun- 
ior high school present the merest sketch of its 
possibilities. So big is the field that an entire 
book might well be devoted to this subject alone. 
Guidance in the Senior High School 
  Guidance Program. The guidance program 
started in the junior high school may be contin- 
ued with some variations in the senior high 
school. Counselors are provided for the senior 
high school on the same basis; there is exactly 
the same need for hearty codperation between 
faculty members and counselors if the plan is 
to succeed. 
Students in the senior high school are, as a
-P-A-G-E-211
  
GUIDANCE 183 
rule, older and more settled as to their future 
educational and vocational careers. There is 
nevertheless plenty of need for careful and sym- 
pathetic guidance and direction. 
Classification of Students. Homogeneous group- 
ing cannot be carried on as completely in the 
senior high school as it is in the junior high 
school, nor is there necessity for so doing. From 
the standpoint of administration there are many 
more difficulties in the senior high school. 
The senior high school is a more homogeneous 
group to start with, although there are undoubt- 
edly differences in ability, interests, and apti- 
tudes. 
Instructional Guidance. If the senior high school 
is a four-year school, it is necessary to provide 
the same courses as outlined for the ninth grade 
in the discussion under junior high school 
guidance. In addition to this, however, it is nec- 
essary in the four-year school for the counselors 
to give further instructional and vocational and 
educational information in various group and 
class conferences. In Pittsburgh part of this ef- 
fort takes the form of tenth-grade group con- 
ferences held for the purpose of discussing 
Pittsburgh industrial life and the opportunities 
it affords to young people, trained and un-
-P-A-G-E-212

trained. An attempt is made to show the stu- 
dents the value of the last two years in high 
school. Educational agencies such as evening 
high schools, correspondence schools, and pri- 
vate business schools are discussed by way of 
comparison as to the opportunities offered. 
Report-Teachers’ Conferences. The report-room 
conference in the activities period is as necessary 
in the senior high school as in the junior high 
school, with some variations in the nature of the 
problems which are likely to be discussed. There 
is quite the same need also for information 
concerning home conditions, outside influences, 
failures, delinquencies, and absences. 
Counselors’ Visits to Contributing Elementary 
Schools. In the case of a four-year senior high 
school receiving its students from the eighth 
grade of elementary schools, the counselor should 
visit the eighth-grade classes of such schools and 
discuss, with students and parents, the following 
subjects: 
1. The need of training beyond the eighth 
grade. 
2. What the high school has to offer beyond 
the elementary school. 
3. Explanation of the courses of the high 
school and their aims. 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
  
GUIDANCE 185 
4. How the home and school can codperate for 
the best interests of the community. 
Counselors’ Conferences. In addition to the 
holding of conferences for the discussion of 
problems already mentioned on these pages, the 
counselor should meet his students in order to 
discuss such questions as the best use of elec- 
tives, and the local placement offices and their 
services. Individual conferences, in the senior 
high school, constitute a large part of the work. 
All students should be met individually during 
their eleventh year by the counselor to make 
certain that their program is complete to date 
and that they are meeting the college entrance 
requirements of the institution they expect to 
enter, or, in the case of those who are not going 
on to college, that they are following a program 
enabling them to meet their vocational require- 
ments. With a proper guidance system, there is 
no excuse for a student’s coming to the end of 
his high school career lacking college entrance 
requirements or other essentials. 
The forms suggested on the following pages 
have been used by the counselor of the Fifth 
Avenue High School, Pittsburgh. They are sug- 
gestive of possibilities in the field of educational 
and vocational guidance and are only given as

much the better. 
LIBRARIAN 
Are you planning to be a librarian? 
Civilization and culture may be measured very largely by 
books and libraries. These are unknown in the land of the 
savage and in the less enlightened countries of the earth, but 
in company with schools and colleges great developments in 
education and influence have been attained. Books are the
-P-A-G-E-218
  190 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
tools many people use to make their lives larger, more in- 
teresting, more efficient, and more successful. 
Our libraries are provided and supported by the people for 
the benefit of their respective communities. 
Library work is particularly suited to women, especially 
to those who are interested in the educational, industrial, 
civic, and recreative betterment of society. Special train- 
ing for library work will be necessary before a high position 
ean be reached. This profession is calling for well- 
qualified men and women. With the introduction of libra- 
ries into elementary, high, and normal schools; colleges; 
commercial, and industrial institutions; state and govern- 
ment departments, library work offers exceptional oppor- 
tunities to those who feel adapted to this type of work. 
A high school education is essential as a minimum prepara- 
tion, while a college course and special training are desir- 
able. 
Essential Qualities for the Librarian 
1. Are you fond of reading books? 
2. Are you neat and clean in your dress and general 
appearance? 
3. Are you polite, courteous, and patient? 
4. Can you systemize your work? 
5. Can you credit yourself with any amount of specific 
reading for information or culture? 
6. Is it natural for you to read the financial, political, and 
educational news items in your paper or are you through 
after reading the sport page and the “funnies”? 
7. Have you a memory capable of carrying a large amount 
of detail, especially of systems and methods? 
8. About your powers of attention—do you notice the 
many opportunities for courteous social acts or do you have 
occasion to regret frequent oversight? 
9. Have you good self-control and some ability to “size 
up” others?
-P-A-G-E-219
  GUIDANCE 191 
10. Have you executive qualities and personal initiative? 
Can you plan, supervise, and direct other people courteously? 
LAW 
Are you planning to be a lawyer? 
Young men and women preparing to enter the law as a 
profession, should study very carefully its requirements 
and possibilities. Law cases involve subject matter of the 
greatest variety; therefore, the young man or woman en- 
tering this profession can scarcely cover too wide a course 
in preparation. 
The following high school subjects offer excellent prepar- 
ation for entrance to pre-law collegiate courses:

Every institution issues a catalogue which furnishes com- 
plete information in regard to tuition rates and living ex- 
penses. Every student contemplating a college course should 
secure this information for himself. Many of our leading 
law schools require one or more years of college preparation 
for entrance. The number of stars preceding the following

STENOGRAPHY 
Are you planning to be a stenographer? 
The term stenography is often vaguely applied to many 
elerical positions. Frequently young men and women en- 
tering this vocation are unsuccessful because they lack the 
necessary foundation and qualifications. 
If you are planning to take up stenography, by all 
means use every opportunity to insure your mastery of 
the English language. A high school education is most de- 
sirable. Learn a new word every day; have a dictionary 
easily accessible and use it. 
Guess work is of little value in stenography. Accuracy 
is more valuable than speed. 
Can You Say Yes to Such Questions as These? 
1. Is good spelling one of my strong points? 
2. Am I rapid and skilful at handwork? 
3. Do I possess an abundance of common sense, loyalty, 
tact, diplomacy, initiative, and energy? 
4. Is it easy for me to remember names, faces, facts, 
dates, and events? 
5. Have I tact and skill in adapting myself to others? 
6. Am I well equipped grammatically to correct a sen- 
tence or supply a word if a mistake were made in dictating 
to me? 
7. Can I become so absorbed in my work or in a book 
so as not to be annoyed or disturbed by others in the room? 
8. Can I be trusted with business confidences?
-P-A-G-E-221
GUIDANCE 193 
9. Am I a close observer of details? 
10. Have I persistence enough to continue by practice 
and experience to develop speed and accuracy after the 
fundamentals have been acquired? 
11. Am I neat in dress and general appearance? 
You would be interested in reading some of the vocational 
themes prepared by pupils of the Fifth Avenue High School 
on “Stenography as a Vocation.” 
PRINTER 
Are you planning to be a printer? 
It is difficult to find a vocation with a history as interest- 
ing as that of printing. For long ages processes of making 
impressions or leaving marks upon a surface were known 
and practiced. There are still many clay tablets, waxed 
surfaces, engraved stones, and blocks that record the be- 
ginnings and indicate the progress of this art. 
The opportunities offered in printing compare favorably 
with other commercial or manufacturing lines. Many 
printers will go through life as journeymen; others will 
start small shops of their own and will develop a business 
of large proportions. This vocation offers excellent oppor- 
tunities for the young man who some day wishes to have a 
business of his own. 
An individual who wishes to become expert as a printer 
should have a good general education and knowledge of 
grammar, spelling, punctuation, and all phases of English. 
It is necessary that one possess good eyesight and an ex- 
ceptionally quick finger. Other essentials are conception 
of form, dexterity, memory, and attention. 
Other Points for Consideration 
1. Do you prefer an indoor occupation? 
2. Are your eyes strong and capable of continuous appli- 
cation to close work?
-P-A-G-E-222

3. Is it natural for you to get absorbed in what you are 
doing? To pay close attention? To concentrate? 
4. Is it your habit to find pleasure in reading advertis- 
ing pages? 
5, Are your fingers quick-motioned and accurate? 
6. Have you a good breathing apparatus—good lungs, 
large nostrils, full chest? 
7. Are correct spelling and punctuation among your good 
qualities? 
8. Do you know just where your personal effects are lo- 
cated in your home—your books, collars, tools? 
9. Have you original ideas on printing? Can you suggest 
changes or improvements in much of the printing you see? 
MEDICINE 
Are you planning to practice medicine? 
The expense and long period of preparation for this 
profession suggest that careful consideration be given by 
young people who are about to choose it as a life work. 
The Counsel on Medical Education of the American Med- 
ical Association and the Bureau of Professional Education 
of the state of Pennsylvania require the following sub- 
jects for entrance to an approved medical school: 
English 
Latin, German or French .. 
(in the same language) .. 
History me 
Mathematics (Algebra, Geometry) ........ Bite: 37? 
Recommended subjects: 
Latin* 
Zoology 
Botany ..

Other electives should consist of cultural rather than 
specific pre-medical courses. 
It is advisable that those preparing to enter this profes- 
sion should read some of our best books on the subject. A 
book written by Daniel W. Weaver on “Medicine as a Pro- 
fession” will be very helpful. 
PLUMBER 
Are you planning to be a plumber? 
The ancient city of Pompeii, whose ruins have been slowly 
uncovered, reveals examples of high-class work in this line. 
Here as in other ancient cities traces of plumbing have 
been found almost equal to the work of today. Ordinarily 
the plumber seems to have worked in lead only, but now 
iron, zine, brass, copper, and various other metals are used. 
Plumbing is usually understood to be the installment of 
pipes to supply water, the erecting of fixtures for the use 
of this supply, and the installment of other pipes to dis- 
pose of waste. 
Young people should not look upon this vocation as one 
lacking in possibilities for future success. It commands 
good wages and leads quite naturally, if there is business 
as well as mechanical ability, to store ownership and con- 
tracting. It demands expert workmanship and careful at- 
tention to every detail. The trade is strongly unionized 
and the wages received compare well with those of other 
vocations. 
The plumber must be a man of character and judgment 
and able to command confidence. He must be fully informed 
as to modern appliances and methods. He must be able 
to read plans and make estimates. He must understand 
general building well enough to work in harmony with car- 
penters and masons. He must not be afraid of hard work 
and at times dirty work. The individual who plans to be- 
come more than a mere workman should secure a high

school education. Mechanical drawing, plan reading, and 
shop work will prove exceedingly valuable. 
Can I Qualify? 
1. Have I read books and magazines on plumbing and 
sanitation? 
2. Do I notice plumbing and pipe work, and could I 
suggest improvements and changes? 
3. Do I like to fix things about the home—pack a faucet, 
clean and repair waste pipes? 
4. Do I like problems that I have to figure and study out? 
5. Am I interested in watching a plumber at work? 
6. Am I energetic, active, and quick of motion? 
7. Am I willing to do strenuous, not always clean, though 
always important work? 
8. Would I rather work with pipe, wrench, taps, and 
dies than with a hammer, saw, or plane? 
Have you talked with some of your friends or neighbors 
who are doing this type of work? Any suggestions that 
you may get from some one already in this field will be 
very helpful in the direction of your preparation. The 
counselor has several articles on plumbing that you should 
read. They are intended for your use—use them.

Tue VALUE or ALGEBRA TO Mr* 
Various academic and technical students have expressed 
wonder that I, a commercial student, should take algebra 
when it is not a required commercial study. They seem 
incapable of comprehending why a person should volun- 
tarily take a subject which seems to be the very epitome of 
difficulty. Perhaps if I were of the same opinion as they 
I never would have taken algebra; but as I had hitherto had 
no difficulty with commercial arithmetic and had enjoyed 
that subject more than any other, I decided to explore 
further into the realms of mathematics. And I can truth- 
fully say that I have never regretted my decision. 
To begin with, the valuable training of the reasoning 
powers should itself be sufficient recompense for any time 
or energy that may be expended in the study of algebra. 
Indeed, few subjects rank higher in strengthening the in- 
tellectual power of young students. Algebra, unlike many 
other studies, deals with practical and logical reasoning. 
And then again we only realize the importance of alge- 
bra when we consider that the various sciences are founded 
upon algebraic principles. These principles never change. 
They are the same as when discovered by Archimides and 
other pioneers in the wide and comprehensive field of math- 
ematics. All the principles of physics and chemistry have 
been discovered by eminent logicians and mathematicians. 
Therefore, in summary, the usefulness of algebra, the val- 
uable training the mind receives, and the fact that it is 
the basis of all the sciences have proven to me that it is 
one of the best subjects taught in the high schools of today.

Srupent* 
When the realization comes home to us that in order to 
appreciate the fine, the beautiful, and the good we must 
actually know what constitutes these things, then we have 
discovered wherein lies the value of English classics to a 
high school student. 
Classics enable the student to appreciate and derive un- 
equaled pleasure from what he reads outside of school, to 
become acquainted with the worthy principles of the great 
men, and to perceive new and beautiful meanings that were 
hitherto unknown to him. We have a selection of classics 
that are unrivaled in their value to the student—a selection 
any student can proudly boast of having studied. Among 
the best, we find Ivanhoe, Tennyson’s Idylls of the King, 
Silas Marner, various speeches of Washington and Lincoln, 
King Henry VIII, and Macbeth. 
Perhaps the greatest value of classics to the student lies 
in the desire to continue to read other classics when he 
leaves school. We find the principle involved here, that 
what we sow we shall reap. And so the student is sowing 
his desire in school to continue to read about and be in- 
fluenced by all that is beautiful and good. Of course, for 
this attainment he must apply, himself diligently to the 
study of these classics, and make an effort to derive much 
benefit from them. 
Classics enable the student to become acquainted with 
the worthy principles of great men. Where indeed could 
be found greater and truer principles than those laid down 
in the speeches of Washington and Lincoln? The student 
is inspired by these principles, and these inspirations in 
turn tend to make him a better citizen of the country and 
of humanity. 
Moreover, classics enable the student to perceive new 
and beautiful meanings that were hitherto unknown to him. 
1 Written by a student. 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
  GUIDANCE 201 
When the student first reads a classic he “observes” what 
he reads: then he “remembers” what he has observed, and 
then he “compares,” thus enabling him to perceive new 
meanings and to think out his own conclusions. 
If the student would only realize these facts and take 
advantage of the wonderful opportunity offered, to him, 
then one of the greatest hopes of the English teacher and 
of the faculty would be realized. 
Tue Vauur or TyYPEWRITING FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A 
Srupent* 
Although I am not taking typewriting for the purpose of 
a profession, yet I class it as one of my favorite subjects. 
You may often hear people say that typewriting does not 
require thought and that it is simply finger work. If you 
were to experience a typewriting test you would soon be 
convinced that this is not the truth. 
Typewriting has helped me to advance in my other sub- 
jects on account of the many ways in which it has profited 
me. First, and above all, it has given me the power of 
concentration. Many people say that Latin, English, and 
Geometry require concentration, but what subject requires 
more concentration than typewriting? In fact, none is the 
answer. 
Another advantage of typewriting is accuracy. We not 
only learn to be accurate in typewriting, but we soon per- 
ceive that we are avoiding many errors in our other sub- 
jects. 
Many of my friends think it very strange when I tell 
them that I am taking the academic course and have elected 
typewriting; but they do not realize its value. I have a 
very poor handwriting and very seldom do I hand in a neat 
paper written with ink. Now, since I am further advanced 
in typewriting, I can typewrite my themes and essays. 
Every teacher likes neat work and what is better than to

CHAPTER X 
HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETICS 
Physical Training Program. In the discussion of 
this subject the writer recognizes some digres- 
sion into the curricular field, since the physical 
training program is both curricular and extra- 
curricular. 
The whole physical training program in the 
high school is receiving more attention at the 
present time than it has ever received before in 
the history of secondary education. The writer 
prefers to call it the health program of the 
school. We have committed ourselves to health 
as the first primary objective of secondary edu- 
cation, and in support of our views we quote 
from ‘‘Cardinal Principles of Secondary Educa- 
tion:’’+ 
Health needs cannot be neglected during the period of 
secondary education without serious danger to the individ- 
ual and the race. The secondary school should therefore 
provide health instruction, inculcate health habits, organize 
an effective program of physical activities, regard health 
needs in planning work and play, and codperate with 
home and community in safe-guarding and promoting health

interests. To carry out such a program it is necessary 
to arouse the public to recognize that the health needs of 
young people are of vital importance to society, to secure 
teachers competent to ascertain and meet the needs of in- 
dividual pupils and able to inculeate in the entire student 
body a love for clean sport, to furnish adequate equip- 
ment for physical activities, and to make the school build- 
ing, its rooms and surroundings, conform to the best stand- 
ards of hygiene and sanitation. 
This simple statement from ‘‘Cardinal Prin- 
ciples’’ gives us a platform upon which to build. 
The health program in most of the high schools 
of the country is limited to competitive athletics, 
formal gymnastics, and some play activities con- 
nected with the ‘‘gym’’ period. An investiga- 
tion undertaken recently by John F. Landis, 
physical director of the Latimer Junior High 
School, Pittsburgh, revealed the fact that in more 
than five hundred junior high schools of the coun- 
try physical training was scheduled not more 
than once or twice per week and that health in- 
struction as a part of the regular physical train- 
ing work was practically unknown. It is undoubt- 
edly true that health instruction in the high 
schools of this country has been neglected, and the 
primary cause of this neglect has been the short- 
age of physical training instructors capable of 
giving health instruction. Teacher-training in- 
stitutions are beginning to recognize that this
-P-A-G-E-233
HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETICS 205 
should be a part of the equipment of every well- 
trained physical instructor. 
Every high school student ought to be sched- 
uled for health instruction for one period every 
day of the week, using the term health instruc- 
tion in its full meaning as covering every phase 
of physical activities. Some school systems are 
rapidly approaching this ideal. Pittsburgh high 
schools, in part, have done this, and some are 
scheduling health instruction four periods each 
week. This instruction is in addition to the time 
given to competitive sports and games outside 
of school hours. 
The Health Program. The health program 
should include physical examinations, regular 
health instruction, correctives, formal gymnas- 
tics, plays and games, competitive intra-school 
contests, and competitive inter-school athletic 
contests. 
Physical Examinations. The physical examina- 
tions should take place at least annually, and 
semiannually if possible. They should be 
thorough, and the work should be done under 
the supervision of the medical inspector of the 
schools. 
Corrective Measures. Corrective measures 
should be undertaken by the physical depart- 
ment immediately following the physical exam-
-P-A-G-E-234
    
206 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
inations. This means that the staff ought to 
be large enough to take care of such corrective 
work, either as a part of the regular physical 
training period or in periods assigned for this 
type of work. 
Health Instruction. Health instruction should 
be a regular part of the week’s work and should 
have a definite time allotment. Physical training 
teachers ought to train and prepare themselves 
for this type of work. The day ought to come 
speedily when they will not be considered com- 
petent or even eligible for appointment if they 
are not prepared to give health instruction. 
Formal Gymnastics. Formal gymnastics should 
be included in the day’s program, but should not 
get nearly so much time as has customarily been 
allotted to the subject. The over-stress that has 
been laid upon this part of the work in past 
years has resulted in the ‘‘gym’’ period becom- 
ing positively repugnant to the student body. A 
short, snappy ten-minute period devoted to it will 
be adequate to promote the desired symmetrical 
physical growth and development and aid in 
bringing to maturity those desirable moral qual- 
ities coming from systematic and regular work. 
Plays and Games. Dr. Hall is correct in saying 
that ‘‘play is always and everywhere the syno- 
nym of youth.’? Boys and girls of high school
-P-A-G-E-235
  HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETICS 207 
age particularly love social games. They are 
enthusiastic over the competitive games, such 
as football and basket ball, perhaps even more 
than those of the social type, but the writer 
is not referring to this class in the present con- 
nection. There is an infinite variety of social 
games today, and the physical directors who fail 
to make use of them are making a mistake. Boys 
and girls are distinctly social animals. They 
like to be in the presence of each other. Why 
would it not be a good thing to bring them to- 
gether in the ‘‘gym”’ period occasionally to play 
games together? 
Intra-school Competitive Games. Competitive 
games within groups and between classes within 
the school afford the school its greatest oppor- 
tunity to give the moral and social training which 
comes from health competition in athletics to all 
the students. This is a phase of the physical 
training program which ought to receive more 
and more attention. It is the prototype of mass 
athletics now being developed in the colleges and 
universities. Inter-school athletics have received 
more than a proportionate share of attention, 
with due allowances to their value and place in 
the program. The usual criticism of inter-school 
contests is that the teams furnish training to but 
eleven football players, five basket-ball players,
-P-A-G-E-236
  208 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
nine baseball players, ete. There can be no 
ground for this criticism in a school which has a 
lively competitive program of athletic activities 
within its own organization. Some of the high 
schools have already proved that great interest 
and enthusiasm can be aroused among the stu- 
dents participating in competitive athletics with- 
in the school itself, and that most of the moral 
and social value attributed to inter-school ath- 
letics may be obtained to the same degree in 
intra-school athletics. 
The English system of athletic sports recog- 
nizes the importance of active participation on 
the part of each individual and trains the boy 
or girl with this in mind from common school 
through university days. 
There is no intention of decrying inter-school 
athletics, but an effort should be made to stress 
the importance and the possibilities in the field 
of intra-school athletic activities. 
Advantages to the Students of Intra- and Inter- 
school Athletics. Competitive athletics, under 
proper conditions, have long been recognized as 
affording excellent opportunity for the develop- 
ment of mental alertness, keenness of discern- 
ment, promptness of decision, and general intel- 
lectual initiative. By their very nature they 
have a tendency to develop these intellectual

-P-A-G-E-239
HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETICS 209 
qualities in those participating. But it is equally 
true that the chief advantages of competitive 
athletics within or without the school are moral 
and social. 
We have been claiming for the entire extra- 
curricular program that it develops such virtues 
as self-control, initiative, self-reliance, courage, 
codperation, vitality, respect for the rights of 
others, loyalty, courtesy, fair play, purpose, de- 
votion to duty, and self-sacrifice. Certainly ath- 
letic games take no less prominent a place in 
developing these than student-government or- 
ganization, school assemblies, clubs, and the rest. 
Athletics also have a value similar to that of 
a safety valve, in that they furnish the occasion 
to get rid of excess exuberance on the part of 
the student body. ‘‘Pep’’ meetings, organized 
rooting, and the ‘‘atmosphere’’ of the games 
themselves furnish just the right conditions for 
getting rid of this excess spirit, which might very 
easily be turned into avenues not quite so whole- 
some. 
C. W. Whitten, state manager of inter-scholas- 
tic athletics in Illinois, stated in a recent address 
that ‘‘when we permit our inter-scholastic con- 
tests to become the avenue of escape for all the 
neurotic jazz hysteria of the entire community, 
of the sensational newspapers that usually have
-P-A-G-E-240
210 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
no ideals above advertising and income, of com- 
mercial clubs and ‘boosters’ clubs whose highest 
conception of ethics are all comprehended in the 
ambition to ‘put the town on the map,’ of that 
class of respectable materialists who loudly pro- 
claim that ‘nothing succeeds like success,’ of 
the town sports and gamblers, of the hangers-on 
of pool rooms and smoke shops, why, we over- 
load our safety valve, and our educational en- 
gine, instead of blowing off, blows up with tre- 
mendous mortality to educational ideals and out- 
comes. And that is exactly what happens when 
the clamorous, anti-educational sporting ele- 
ments of the community undertake to direct or 
to exert any appreciable influence upon high 
school athletics.’’ 
There is a spirit of commercialism in inter- 
scholastic contests which must be guarded 
against; it is one of the evils confronting school 
people everywhere in connection with athletic 
contests without the school. Last season the 
writer attended a basket-ball game between two 
prominent high school teams in an armory in a 
certain city. A great crowd, representing stu- 
dents and community, had turned out for the 
game, and was there to win by hook or crook. 
Sportsmanship apparently was an unfamiliar 
word to them. As a result the entire game—its 
   
-P-A-G-E-241
  HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETICS 211 
setting, progress, and outcome—was anything 
but creditable to the high schools concerned. 
‘When schools and communities become im- 
bued with ideals leading to such immoral and 
discourteous conduct, it is high time for school 
officials to take a courageous and determined 
stand to educate the school and community to 
better things. 
Another advantage of competitive athletics is 
the real joy and pleasure the participants derive 
from them. This is a worth-while end in itself. 
If boys and girls are to learn how to use their 
leisure time worthily, it is well that they learn 
how to play. This will help them to spend many 
leisure hours worthily not only during their high 
school life but throughout all life as well. 
Nothing is gained by attempting to deny that 
high school students like athletics. Much is to 
be gained, on the other hand, by taking advan- 
tage of the situation and using it to its fullest 
extent in developing character in all of its va- 
rious aspects. 
Another advantage of competitive athletics is 
the opportunity they afford for the formation 
of correct habits of living, temperance, modera- 
tion, and bodily care. There is a compelling mo- 
tive in refraining from any kind of conduct or 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
  212 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
bodily abuse likely to lessen the chances of suc- 
cess. 
Nature of the Athletic Program. The games se- 
lected for competitive sports will be determined 
to some extent by the age and physical condition 
of the students. Of course only those games 
which may be expected to develop through prac- 
tice the virtues mentioned in the preceding pages 
ought to be given a place on the athletic pro- 
gram. Football, basket ball, baseball, tennis, 
swimming and track and field events seem to 
have a very firm hold on the American high 
schools today. Soccer has not won its way 
among high schools in the rapid way its charac- 
teristics as a good game would seem to promise. 
It has been substituted for the boys of junior high 
school age in Pittsburgh for Rugby football, in 
the belief that it is a more suitable game for 
boys of adolescent years. Although the boys 
have not accepted it enthusiastically, it is hoped 
that eventually it will win its way into their 
hearts and lives. Volley ball, basket ball, base- 
ball, tennis, and swimming are common to both 
junior and senior high schools. 
Perhaps the most strenuous of these games is 
basket ball. The number of games played each 
week in basket ball ought to be limited and reg- 
ulated. Because of its strain on the heart, phys-
-P-A-G-E-243
HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETICS 213 
ical training instructors should be sure about 
the heart action of the students before they are 
permitted to take part. Football is strenuous, 
and, at times, somewhat dangerous because of 
the personal contact and mass plays in the game. 
It is a game, however, that calls for decision, 
alertness, physical judgment, courage, self-con- 
trol, and quick thinking as few games do. The 
physical training instructor in charge of foot- 
ball has a great responsibility in the matter of 
allowing only those boys who are physically fit 
to play. It is not intended, though, to discuss 
the relative merits of all of the common games 
in this volume. As compared to the rest of the 
extra-curricular program, athletics have been in 
the high schools for a long period. They have 
become an established part of the program. In- 
deed, athletics have become so prominent in most 
schools as to be considered of equal importance 
with the curricular program and have been rec- 
ognized and placed on a regular footing with 
English, the social studies, and mathematics, in 
so far as time schedule and importance are con- 
cerned. 
Athletic Program for Girls. Girls as well as boys 
are engaged today in competitive athletic games. 
They are playing basket ball, indoor baseball, 
volley ball, tennis, swimming, and are indulging, 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  
  214 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
as a matter of fact, in practically every game 
played by boys, except football and soccer. 
While true that the rules have been modified 
somewhat to meet their particular needs, the girls 
have their track events just as the boys do and 
are enjoying the privilege of a rich program of 
athletic activity. 
Athletic Coaches. Coaching athletic teams ought 
to be considered as a feature of the work of a 
physical training or health instructor. No doubt 
it is an important feature, but it should not be 
given more consideration than ability to give 
regular health instruction or perform any of the 
other customary duties of a good instructor in 
this field. The main difficulty in the past and to 
a large extent in the present, is that we have 
had athletic coaches and nothing else. Wide- 
spread instances may be found of coaches who 
are paid more than high school principals. This 
is merely emphasizing the importance of the 
position beyond all proportion and usually re- 
sults from a false community ideal which de- 
mands that the town be ‘‘put on the map”’ with 
a winning team. Such a basis of athletics often 
makes the team a mere machine and the coach 
everything—an unwelcome situation for the 
boys and girls at best. 
/ Physical training teachers have a grave re-
-P-A-G-E-245
  
HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETICS 215 
sponsibility to the boys and girls under their 
care. Their influence with the students is usu- 
ally far greater than that of any other mem- 
ber of the teaching staff. It is because of this 
that the physical training instructors should be 
men and women of sterling worth, using their 
influence with the boys and girls always in the 
interest of loyalty to the school and true, clean 
living. 
Athletic Council. It is well to have an athletic 
council in every high school of considerable 
size. Such an organization becomes a valuable 
aid in athletic control and management; in giv- 
ing financial organization and support; and in 
helping to mold school opinion in favor of high 
ideals of sportsmanship, fair play, courtesy to 
visiting teams, and the other standards of sound 
athletic activity. 
The membership of this council should con- 
sist of one or two representatives from each re- 
port class or home room. It should organize 
with its own officers. As the directing force 
back of the organization, the principal or some 
one delegated by him should be a member of 
the council, working, of course, through the stu- 
dents. The council should meet once each week 
in the activities period. Through its members, 
it will come into contact with the entire student
-P-A-G-E-246
216 EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES 
body which, in home-room meetings, will ap- 
prove or disapprove its actions as reported by 
the delegates. The home room can also initiate 
policies through its representatives on the coun- 
cil. The council should function for athletics 
in practically the same way as the student-gov- 
ernment organization functions for other stu- 
dent problems. In small schools, where the 
duties of the student-government organization 
are not of great weight or extent, that body 
might well take over the functions of an athletic 
council. 
It is apparent that the athletic council should 
replace the old ‘‘athletic association’? as an 
agency for controlling athletics in the high 
school. The old organization was too unwieldy 
in large schools for purposes of discussion and 
action.

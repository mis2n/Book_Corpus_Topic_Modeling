SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
To THe GENARAL ASSEMBLY oF THE Stare oF TENNESSE: 
As the subject of amending the Common School Laws of the State 
is included among matters to be considered during the present extra 
session; and as a Report by my Assistant, as Superintendent of Pub- 
lic Instruction, contains facts and statistics showing the present con- 
dition of Common Schools throughout the State, I herewith transmit 
it for your consideration, hoping that it may aid you in arriving at 
a just conclusion on this important subject. 
The facts therein presented, showing the effects of a general diffu- 
sion of education among the masses, upon the productive capacity 
of the country, the prevention of crime, &c., and the apathy jof the 
counties, present the question squarely as to whether it is not the 
_ imperative duty of your honorable body at this session to impose a 
specific tax for School purposes. I earnestly recommend that five 
thousand copies be printed and distributed throughout the State. 
Respectfully, 
W. MORROW, 
Treas. and Supt. Pub. Inst., ex officio.

REPORT 
OF THE 
ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
Nasuvi.iz, March 14, 1872. © 
Siz :—Immediately upon my appointment as Assistant Superin- 
tendent of Public Instruction, on the 22d of January last, a circular 
letter was addressed to the County Court Clerks of the ninety-two 
organized counties in the State, propounding certain inquiries, and 
requesting that answers be returned within ten days. Between fifty 
and sixty counties have responded, and the information so procured 
has been collated, condensed and arranged in the alphabetical order 
of the counties, all of which has been appended and madeva part of 
this preliminary Report. It will be seen that less than thirty coun- 
ties have levied a tax for schvol purposes, and in the remainder no 
action whatever has been taken by the County Courts. The infor- 
mation obtained is very meager, and some system should be devised 
by which more reliable statistics may be procured. A very few 
counties have schools at present in operation, and a degree of lan- 
guor and inaction prevails throughout the State that bodes anything 
else but good to our educational interests. 
The law requiring the County Court, in case a majority of the 
Justices shall refuse to levy a tax, to order an election to ascertain 
. the wishes of a majority of the voters in the county has in many 
counties remained a dead letter upon the statute book. The Magis- 
trates have, in many cases, assumed the responsibility of deciding 
the question themselves. Unless some measure can be devised to 
compel the Magistrates to discharge the obligations resting upon
-P-A-G-E-7
6 
them in this particular, it will be far better for the interests of 
education that the whole law be repealed. Executed but par- 
tially and feebly, as it is at present, and dependent for its 
efficiency upon the personal feelings of the Magistrates of each 
county, there can be no permanency in the schools, and but little 
profit. No system requiring a series of years to perfect and 
carry out, can be established. Indeed, while thegcounty system, 
if adopted, and faithfully administered in the spirit of the law, 
would be promotive of good results, still the want of unity of 
aim and of action throughout the State, which can only be 
secured by having a competent head, will always be a drawback 
to the highest efficiency and usefulness of our public schools. In 
many of the counties where a school-tax has been levied, Commis- 
sioners have been elected who are opposed to any system of public 
instruction, and feel a greater desire to make public schools unpopu- 
lar by making them inefficient and of but little value, than to see 
them gaining ground and winning their way to public favor by edu- 
cating, elevating and refining the public heart and mind. In neigh- 
borhoods where a high order of intelligence prevails, and where a 
decided interest has been manifested by the best citizeris, good 
schools exist under the county system. On the other hand, where 
these conditions do not exist, free schools of the most worthless char- 
acter are kept up a few weeks in the year, and taught by men whose 
chief distinction and fitness for the position lies in the severity and 
cruelty of their discipline, and their adhesion to text-books used 
half a century ago. In many cases these men have been employed 
by the Commissioners without examination ; for men who are quali- 
fied to conduct such examinations are unwilling to act as Commis- 
sioners, and devote their time and energies to schools so ephemeral 
in their character and so unproductive of benefits to the commu- 
nity. 
My observations and the information I have been ‘able to gather 
since entering upon my present duties have convinced me of the 
necessity of having some éentral head in the State, whose whole 
time shall be devoted to the supervision of schools already in opera- 
tion and to the creation of a sentiment in favor of public education 
throughout the State. In this manner there can be collected and 
published that statistical information which the experience of every 
State, where a system of public instruction has been successfully 
inaugurated, shows to be a necessity in order to ensure the greatest 
improvement in the system and a harmonious working of the whole.
-P-A-G-E-8

Some public record should be made in order that the schools in one 
county may be compared and contrasted with those of another, and 
so beget a healthy spirit of emulation which contributes so much to 
elevate the standard of excellence in every vocation of life. 
Tt is a painful distinction to a State whose sons heretofore have 
been distinguished for their valor‘and whose daughters have been 
noted for their accomplishments, to be classed second in illiteracy. 
Tt suggests retrenchment in a manner that we are least able to afford. 
Ignorance since the world begun is the parent of crime. Darkness 
of intellect and moral turpitude usually go hand in hand. It is surely 
bad policy to destroy the means that lead to social elevation, if by so 
doing crime and vice are multiplied and encouraged. Vice is conta- 
gious. It infects the atmosphere of the ignorant; it lies in the 
haunts of the untutored ; it lingers by the side of stupidity ; it mates 
with prejudice; it consorts with passion, error and superstition, and 
finds its safest lurking place in the dens of the illiterate. Thrift, 
peace, plenty, hongsty, and good morals are to be found usually in 
the abodes of intelligence. They keep pace with it. In Iceland, 
Norway, Sweeden, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, and most of the 
German States where good schools are maintained, pauperism and 
crime have rapidly decreased, while in England where the common 
people are less educated than those of any Protestant country, 
pauperism has become an evil so monstrous that her wisest statesmen 
stand appalled at it. The statistics of crime in that country are so 
enormous and alarming that Mr. Forster, a: member of Parliament, 
introduced and carried through a bill, in the year 1870, to secure 
school districts all over the country. Provision is now made for the 
education of every child in England and Wales. Jt was insisted by 
the friends of the bill that the extension of the franchise demanded 
increasad facilities for education in order to insure the country 
against the corrupting influences of ignorant voters. — 
I have referred to this because our State is in the same condition. 
During the last decade the franchise has been extended to 50,000 
ignorant voters, whose obligations to society cannot be known unless 
society provides for their instruction. It is better to make them 
intelligent voters and laborers than to support them in our jails and 
penitentiaries. It is better to educate them than to give insecurity 
to property by suffering them to remain in ignorance and vice 
They are ductile material in the hands of designing men. 
There are occasions in the history of every State when its adver- 
sity or prosperity depends upon the direction given by the ruling
-P-A-G-E-9
8 
power. If that power is ignorance or superstition, there will be no 
abilty to improve its fortunes or to preserve its excellenco, A dema- 
gogue prefers ignorance because it guarantees his advance ; he de- 
spises intelligence because it destroys his occupation and influence. ° 
From such a class of politicians nothing can be expected to advance 
the cause of education and improvement. They are the owls of 
society who work in darkness and obscurity, feast upon error and 
ignorance, and take their flight when the sunlight of knowledge and 
intelligence bursts upon them. “The greatest despotism on earth,’ 
says DeTocqueville, ‘is an excited untaught public sentiment, and 
we should hate not only despots, but despotism.” What has Tennes- 
see lost already by her ignorant voters and corrupt politicians? She 
bas contracted debts, without any corresponding benefit, amounting 
to millions. The old method, of robbery has ceased. It is not now 
* Your money or your life!” but ‘Place me in power.” “Supply me 
with opportunities by giving me your vote, and I will make the rich 
_ men howl!” All the evil passions are appealed.to. The untutored 
mind having an imperfect conception of right is worked upon antil 
erime is committed, and society must pay for the punishment of the- 
criminal. Public opinion must be enlightened where the structure 
of government gives power to public opinion, or else the State is 
constantly in danger. It slumbers, as it were, upon a volcano. There 
is no security in such State for property but in bolts and bars; there 
is no security for life but in the hangman’s gallows. 
It would seem, without argument, to be a self-evident proposition 
that as the punishment of crime belongs to society as a whole, so 
the restraint and prevention of crime belong also to. society, and 
that whatever the experience of mankind shows 1o be effective in 
restraining crime and securing property and life should be adopted 
by society to effect that end. Precisely the same course of reason- 
ing would lead to the establishment of a system of public schools, 
that would lead to the erection of jails and penitentiaries. In trath 
the reason is greater for the establishment of schools, for the sta- 
tistics of ever} State show that “the ratio of uneducated criminals to 
the whole number of uneducated persons is twenty times as great as 
the ratio of educated criminals to the whole number of educated 
inhabitants.” In the State of New York in the year 1841, it was 
twenty-eight times as great. The average per cent. of the State 
prison population in 1864 that could not read was 32, There were 
2400 belonging to that population, and they showed eleven times 
amore ignoyance than the population outside, because it was ascer-
-P-A-G-E-10
9 
tained that only three per cent. of the non-prison population could 
not read. . 
In the Auburn prison out of 244 inmates only 39 could read and 
- write. In the Sing Sing prison not five per cent. could write a legible 
hand, and not two per cent. could write a correct English sentence. 
Out of 700 in prison at one time only 3 were liberally educated. 
Tn 1840, in twenty counties in England and Wales with a popula- 
tion of 8,724,338, only 59 educated persons were convicted of crime. 
In thirty-two other counties, with a population of 7,182,491, not one 
educated person was convicted. On the other hand, out of a popu- 
lation of 59,123 apprehended by the officers of the law in 1845, 
5,263 could neither read ner write, and 39,659 could barely read. 
In the four best-taught counties in England there was one convic- 
tien for every 1,108 persons. In the four worst-taught, there was 
one for every 550 inhabitants. In the four best-taught counties 
there was one school to every 700 inhabitants. In the four worst- 
taught, there was one school for every 1,501 inhabitants ; from which 
it is seen that crime was in almost exactly the reverse ratio to the 
amount of instruction received. 
Out of 252,544 persons convicted in England and Wales for a 
‘series of years, 229,300, or more than 90 per cent. were uneducated, 
and only 1,085 less than one-half of one per cent. were well edu- 
cated. 
_ It is asserted by a writer in thé Princeton Review for January, 
1871, that 97 per cent. of the non-prison population in New York 
jn 1864, eould read; in the same year only 68 per eent. of the 
prison-population could read. Knowing how to read is two- 
thirds as favorable to honesty as not knowing. The same writer 
says that 67 per cent. out of 2,120 criminals in the Ohio Peni- 
tentiary were uneducated, that is, men who could barely read, or 
who could merely scratch their names: 14 per cent. did not know 
their letters, and 74 per cent. had never learned «trade. Here were 
81 per cent. ignorant of books. Mr. Kay, an English statesman, 
places the rate among the convicts of England as high as 95 per 
cent., and not one criminal in two hundred, deserves. to be called 
educated. The Hon. John Eaton, Commissioner of Education, in 
his report for the year 1871, advanced sheets of which he furnished 
me says there were 17,000 persons reported in the prisons of the 
United States in 1866. Of the erime committed in New England, 
at least 80 per cent. is done by those who have no elementary instruc- 
tion. All the erime committed in the United States is done by from
-P-A-G-E-11
10 
3 to 7 per cent. of the population, and less than one-fifth of one per 
cent. is committed by persons of education. 
But why multiply examples? If any truth can “be deduced from 
an accumulation of facts, surely enough have’ becn gathered to jus- 
tify the conclusion that education diminishes crime, improves the 
public morals, elevates the public sentiment, and adds to the public 
prosperity. The amount paid for education is so much saved from 
the amount that would be, without education, necessary to suppress 
crime, or punish a criminal. In an economical point of view it is 
cheaper to educate a man than punish him. Is it more in conso- 
nance with’ the feelings of the people of Tennessee to do the last 
than to provide for the first? It is known as well as any fact that 
education and crime are antagonistic. Why encourage the last and 
discourage the first? Why build penitentiaries and jails, and not 
school-houses? It is known that education dimishes crime. . It is 
not known that penitentiaries reform criminals. Where is the profit 
to a State or county to lose a good citizen and support a villain? 
But a few words about our own State prison. There are now 
undergoing punishment 768 persons convicted of crimes ranging 
from petty larceny to cold blooded murder. 
In reply to my inquiry as to the relative number of educated and 
uneducated now in the prison, the present efficient Superintendent 
Bays:

Respectfully, &c., : 
JOEL A. BATTLE, 
Supt. of Prison. 
It has taxed the best intellect in the State to devise a plan by 
which these criminals may-be rendered scif-supporting. They are
-P-A-G-E-12
i 
said now to be so. ‘Grant that it is so; and that they make an 
amount sufficient over and-above their support, to pay the interest 
on the money invested in buildings, &e., necessary to secure their 
confinement. Still the question arises, How much does the State 
lose by 768 productive laborers being rendered unproductive? Tt 
loses according to the estimation of the best publicists $40 for each 
man annually. This sum would educate in public schools six times 
the number of inmates. Suppose one-half could by education have 
been prevented from committing crime (and the statistics from every 
country renders such a conjecture prdbable) then the State has 
thrown away enough to educate just three times as many as are in 
confinement. ‘“It‘has done more. It has exchanged ‘for each one of 
those that might have been made a-good citizen, with all the wealth 
and knowledge which such an one might ‘havo accumulated, an ig- 
norant, vicious villain, a ‘blight on the State and a disgrace to its 
civilization. 
The Board of Inspectors, in their report to the Governor, em- 
bracing a period from March 1, 1870, to September 1, 1871, say. that 
the increase in crime and in the number of convicts in our State 
is very perceptible; and thatthe subject of how to apply prison 
labor is one for the most serious consideration. They ascribe this 
inerease of crime to “want of knowledge, want of trade, want of 
-work, want of assistance, want of parents, want of friends, want of 
intellect, want of moral training, combined with evil associations 
and influence.” ‘Upon none,” they continue, “do these erime-pro- 
ducing wants fall with moro certainty of evil effect than upon the 
young and inexperienced.” T desire especially to direct your atten- 
tion to the causes of crime enumerated above, nearly every one of 
which could be removed by a judicious system of public schools and 
these young, neglected, ignorant children made useful citizens. 
The punishment of crime is a costly luxury. The amount paid - 
for the prosecution and conviction of criminals out of the State 
Treasury for the year ending October 1, 1871, as shown by the Comp- 
troller’s report, was $171,542 76. In this is not included damages 
done to property, nor the loss of life, nor the county expenses nor, 
the extra police force demanded for the protection of life and prop- 
erty; nor the depreciation of morals in the community. Society is 
lowered by the pestilential presence of so many criminals; the seeds 
of vice are scattered; the public conscience is hardened, and evils 
from which there is no refuge sown broadcast over the State. No 
One can estimate the injury done to a community by the encourage.
-P-A-G-E-13
12 
ment of pauperism and crime. It unsettles the very foundation of 
society, and transforms into curses what were designed as blessings. 
The members of the General Assembly, in their legislative capacity, 
should look seriously and earnestly to this question. In its magni- 
tude and infiuence it overshadows all others, for the object of all law 
is to benefit and protect the members of society both in their persons 
and property. Let them assume the responsibility and meet this 
question in a manner its importance deserves. Let this “flood of 
crime,” that is rising and raging against the very battlements of 
the State be arrested.. It is a great responsibility to levy a tax to 
make useful men and women from this harvest of ignorant children 
in our State; it is a still greater responsibility not to do it. Great 
actions imply and demand great responsibilities. 
There is another reason why our people should be aroused to the 
necesity of establishing a good system of public schools. It is always 
a matter of paramount importance to the prosperity of a State that 
its surplus lands should be occupied by an industrious, onergetic, 
and intelligent population. We have in the State of Tennessee over 
29,000,000 acres of land, and only a little over 6,000,000 in cultiva- 
tion The remaining 23,000,000 are lying idle and contributing 
nothing to the State. It will hang a dead weight upon the pros- 
perity of the State, until it can be tilled or occupied by industrious 
citizens. Now, such men and women will not settle in a State that 
offers no facilities for education. “Like.seeks like. Woscitur ex sociis 
is a law as old humanity. Intelligent men and women will seek 
locations that supply food to the mind, as well as aliment to the 
body. We may have an abundance of cheap lands; we may have 
inexhaustible stores of mincral wealth; we may have a delightful 
climate, rich soil, and all the advantages that nature can give and 
still all these will never tempt the best class of immigrants—the 
class that will make good citizens and help by their intelligence and 
energy to dovelop the. resources of the State, unless we give them 
the means of educating their children. We may inveigh against the 
principle of taxing one man to educate the children of another; we 
may declaim against the interference of the State in matters that 
concern direetly the parents of children; we may use all the thou- 
sand and one flimsy excuses that are made by men whose habits of 
thought have not led them to the investigation of this subject in its 
relation to.the prosperity of a State, and yet this question will recur: 
how can we develop our great resources without an increase in the 
amount of skilled and intelligent labor, and how can we procure
-P-A-G-E-14
13 
such labor without showing our appreciation of intelligence by sup- 
plying our people with the means of becoming so? There is no way 
in which we can so soon be relieved of our taxes as by increasing 
our tax-payers. There is no way in which we can increase our tax- 
payers so surely as by offering inducements to intelligent men and 
women to come amongst us. One intelligent laborer will add, on an 
average at least twenty-five per cent more, annually, to the wealth 
of the State than an ignorant one. The per capita productive capa- 
city of each man, woman and child in the State of Massachusetts for 
the year 1856 is said to have been $166.60. For the same year in 
the State of Tennessee it was $63.10. That is, one person in the 
rigorous climate and poor soil of Massachusetts makes nearly three 
times as much as one in the rich fields and genial climate of our own 
State. There are 1,258,520 persona in the State of Tennessee. The 
annual aggregate per capita production of all this number falls 
short of what it would be in the State of Massachusetts, if the above 
statement is true, by $130,255,820—a sum equal in value to one 
half of the improved farms in the State. And this because the 
labor of our State cannot utilize the powers of nature. No wonder 
that the gigantic intellect of Mr. Adams should have discerned the 
truth that the public schools of New England are more important 
even to the rich themselves than all their-riches. The same senti- 
ment was reiterated by Mr. Webster, who also regarded public 
instruction as a wise and liberal System of police, by which Prop- 
erty and life, and the peace of society are secured. 
‘the greatest obstacle to be overcome in the establishment of a 
system of public instruction in our State is the inherited idea that 
education should be left to private enterprise, and that property 
should not be taxed to educate those without means; that it is 
neither consonent with justice nor demanded by charity; that the 
father of a child should be compelled to educate him, and that it is 
an encouragement to idleness, and has a tendency to impair or de- 
stroy the sense of obligation in the minds of parents as.to the duty 
of educating their children. 
The argument that it should be left to private enterprise goes too 
- far. It would apply to matters of police; to the establishment of 
courts of justice; to the erection of jails and penitentiaries; and to 
the workings of the highways. All these are established for the. 
protection or convenience of property. Society calls upon the poor 
man to contribute as much to keep the highways in order, though 
he may own nothing, as him who runs long wagon trains. The poor
-P-A-G-E-15
14 
man contributes: bis money to. support courts of justice, though he 
may have no property to protest. He is-the man who is first drafted 
into the army to protect property. He has no money to pay to re- 
lieve him from the burdens and hardships of protecting money. 
Upon him and upon his valor rest, in the main, the fame and glory 
' of the nation. Education will make him a better soldier. This was 
well shown in the recent war between France and Germany, in 
which the discipline of the German troops, acquired through a long 
course of training in the public schools, was. more than a match for 
tho French. 
Dr. L. P. Brockett, author of a History of the Franco-German 
war of 1870-71, in-reviewing the condition of the two countries en- 
gaged, at the outset says: : 
“In Germany, and especially in Prussia education is well-nigh 
universal. The population.of the North German Confederation, in 
1867, was 29,653,038, and that of South Germany. 8,869,328: making 
a total of 38,522,366. Of this-population only an infinitesimal pro- 
portion are unable to read and write, while the greater part have a 
good public school education. 
“The great advantages of this thorough education have made 
themselves visible in the improved social condition and greater in- 
‘ telligence of the masses; and have made them vastly better soldicrs 
in a cause where their patriotic fegkings are enlisted. It has resulted 
too, in.a larger measure of thri nd. business enterprise throughout 
the whole of Germany. Nearly evory. town has its thriving manu- 
factory. 
“The social condition of France-is-not so good. The wealth, in- 
telligence, and business activity of the country, and to a large extent 
its poverty and crime, also, have been concentrated in Paris, and 
two or three other large cities. Education is very much neglected. 
Thirty per cent. of the conscripts (who represent very. fully the 
male adult population.of France) cannot read or. write. The school 
age of children is only from.seven to-thirteen, and. nearly a million, 
or about one-fifth of the entire number of children between these 
ages, do not attend school.: Morals; as is well known, are at a very 
low ebb. One-eighth.of the births (taking city and country together,) 
are known to be illegitimate, and a still larger proportion are con- 
cealed by infanticide, whichis so. prevalent as to make the per cent- 
age of increase of population in France smaller than that of any 
other European state.” 
‘As an instrument, then, for the protection of property, property
-P-A-G-E-16
15 
should look to-it that itis made as-effective as-possible.Nearly all the: 
machinery of government is for the protection.of property, and if the 
subject of education is to-be left to private enterprise, why not leave 
the protection of property to private enterprise also? Besides, the 
poor boy who derives an education from public schools is not bene- 
fitted more than property. Wherever good public schools prevail prop- 
erty increases in value; rents go up ;..labor can be procured at cheaper 
rates by reason of other inducements offered-to the laborers. This 
was strikingly illustrated in the county of Montgomery while her pub- 
lic schools were in operation. Laborers for farm work, men, hired for 
$150 per annum in. that county, while the adjoining counties in 
Kentucky. had to pay $175.. The farmers of Montgomery saved on 
each man $25 per annum, because they offered educational facilities 
for the children of the laborer, which«more than repaid all the taxes 
assessed for school purposes. But.the benefits.are greater than these. 
Fhe amount paid for education may, as a general rule, be deducted 
from. the amount paid for crime, at the same time the improvement 
in-society adds vastly to the value of property. It is entirely just, 
therefore; that property should be taxed to educate the ignorant, 
because this education gives security to it, and increases its value 
much more than property is required to pay in behalf of education. 
As to the question of lessening the sense of obligation in the mind 
of the parent of educating his qi © agree with the Princeton 
Review for 1866. The fact is ex: e contrary, Those commu- 
nities in which there are no common schools, and in which the people 
generally are in a state of deplorable ignorance, are precisely those 
in which the sense of parental obligation on this.point is at its low- 
est ebb. Go to a region of country, in which not one man. in ten 
can read and write, and you will find that not. one man in ten will 
care whether his children-are taught to read and write. Those com- 
munities, on the contrary, which have the best and most complete 
system of common schools, and in which this system has prevailed 
longest, and has taken most complete hold of the public mind, are 
the very ones.in which individuals will be found most keenly alive 
to the importance of the subject, and in which a parent will be re- 
garded as a. monster if his children dre allowed to grow up uneda- 
cated. _ 
s, The truth is, the duties of the parent and of. society in this respect 
lie in coincident lines, and each should, as far as possible, provide 
for the intellectual development and moral training, of the child. 
Assuredly, however, should the parent not be able -to provide for
-P-A-G-E-17
16 
these wants, the society which is to be cursed or blessed by it should 
look to it. Its highest interests demand it. A community is as 
much to blame, and has as mach to suffer. as the parent, by allow- 
ing a child to grow up in.ignorance, stupidity and. vice, and should 
therefore, provide against such a calamity by seeing that all children 
are instructed in the elements of “learning, virtue and science.” 
' It is nothing to the discredit of education that some men triumph 
in life without it. Their success depends in such a case on their in_ 
domitable will, their caculating sagacity, and their superior natura] 
abilities. Had such men been educated, they might have reached 
much higher positions, or reached the positions they attained ina 
much shorter time. Education does not supply brain; it only makes 
the greatest possible use of it. . 
But as a matter of economy to the aggregated people of the State 
the law should provide a system of public iastruction. It is demon- 
etrable that three times as many children may be instructed in pub- 
lic schools for the same money as in private schools. The whole 
outlay by the State of Tennessee for public instruction, in 1868, was 
$573,785.74. During the same year 185,845 children attended schools 
for the space of five months, which gives the cost for the tuition of each 
child, $3.08. In private schools it was at least three times as high, so 
that had these children been compelled to go to private schools they 
could only have gone one an irds months. The same thing 
js witnessed to-day in Nash I am informed by the Hon. S, 
Y. Caldwell, the Superintendent of City Schools. The cost of send- 
ing a child to the high schools being just one-third the amount re- 
quired to send him to a private school of the same grade. If this 
be so, of which there is no doubt, it will be seen that the commu- 
nity in the aggregate, by establishing public schools, can save two- 
_ thirds of the’:mount required to be expended in private schools, and 
enjoy the same amount of intellectual cultivation for the children. 
. This results from a more complete systematizing of all the operations 
of the schools, having all the scholars properly classified, so that one 
teacher may instruct 8 much larger.number, and do it more effi- 
ciently. : 
From advance sheets of the ninth census, it appears that the num- 
per of illiterate persons in the State of Tennessee, adult and minor, 
ten years old and over, (Chinese and Indians excluded) is 364,668, of 
whom 138,955 are between the ages of ten and twenty-one years 
old; the remainder 225,713 twenty-one -years old and over. Of 
the adulis, there are of white males, 37,713; colored, 55,927 j
-P-A-G-E-18
, 17 
aggregating 93,640 male adults, who are unable to read and write, 
and yet whose votes are as potential for good or evil as those 
of the wisest men in the State. The total vote cast at the last 
Gubernatorial election was $120,479, and yet ignorance had the 
power of casting 93,640 of those. The bare statement of these facts 
is alarming. It shows upon what a precarious and unstable founda- 
tion the highest interests of our State rest. 
There are 68,825 white women in the State who can neither read 
nor write, and 63,248 colored, making in ail of illiterate women, 
132,073. . 
Bat it is for the children that we feel the deepest solicitude. There 
are 72,189 white children between the ages of 10 and 21, who can 
neither read nor write, and 66,766 colored. 1t may safely be assumed 
that a large proportion of the white children have been made or- 
phans by the results of the war. Their natural protectors have 
laid down their lives in the defence, as they honestly believed and 
felt, of the rights of property. Shall property now hesitate to edu- 
cate these children and make them useful members of that society 
which the valor of their fathers illustrated and defended? What- 
ever may be said of others, these orphans, at least, should be liberally 
educated by the property of the State. ‘ 
There is another lamentable fact dedycible from the census of 
1870. It is that while the white én has increased but 13 per 
cent., the increase in the number ite illiterates has been 50 per 
cent. The white population has 1 ased from 826,722 to 936,119. 
The number of illiterates among the adults has increased from 
71,114 to 106,538. And this illiteracy 1s to-day increasing in a 
greater ratio. Ten years without schools, and the necessity which 
has compelled many of the white people to perform manual labor, 
have not served to intensify their desire for educatjg: = There have 
      
  been fewer good schools in the rural districts during fl last decade ° 
than was ever known in the State in proportion to the population. 
The discouragements to every branch of industry which the war 
occasionod, fell heaviest upon the teachers’ vocation. And the pol- 
icy pursued by the State has been, in the main, detrimental to the 
cause of education. Publieschools are unpopular because they have 
been, with few exceptions, totally inefficient The constant changes 
which have. been wrought in our school systems by nearly every 
legislative body that has met, have created in the public mind a 
sense of their inconstancy, instability and inefficiency. They have 
not only failed to supply a much felt necessity in every community ! 
2 .
-P-A-G-E-19

but the parsimonious appropriations have just been sufficient to in- 
terfere with, and, in a measure, break down all private enterprises. 
‘The amounts distributed to each county have been totally inade- 
quate to accomplish any good. The commissioners, in many cases, 
to relieve themselves of any responsibility, would employ a few 
peripatetic teachers wholly unfit, ofteritimes, for the duties devolv- 
ing upon them, and suffer them to teach until the funds were ex- 
hausted, when the announcement would be made that the schools 
“would be suspended until the following year, when they would be 
resumed for one or two months more. 
And these have been the facilities offered by the great State of 
Tennessee for the education of her children, The question arises 
whether these facilities are to be improved, or whether Tennessee 
js to remain stationary while the sea of thought and intelligence is 
whirling around her. To do so will be to attract within her borders 
all the slime, and draff, and offal that fester and float upon the sur- 
face of society. Our working men have less interest in the matter 
than our men of property. They are not anchored to the soil. It 
j8 an easy matter for them to fiy to other States that promise educa- 
‘tional advantages. And there they will go with their muscle and 
their energy, seeking a home of fresher activities and brighter pros- 
pects, unless equal indugements are offered here. The report of the 
Commissioner of Educatiéy year 1871, will show that all the 
States surrounding Tennet the exception of North Carolina 
are making energetic and w irected efforts to build up good sys- 
tems of public instruction. All those States have able, energetic 
‘and thoroughly competent State Superintendents, who are working 
with a will to infuse now vitality in their educational systems. The 
fact is clearly recognized “that education must underlie every per- 
te 1       
manent im ment in the State, whether material, social or civil.” 
It may belyell, perhaps, in this connection, 1o mention the Hdn- 
eatiogal Bill that has just passed the House of Representatives of 
“the Congress of the United States. Whatever opinions may be en- 
tertained as to the abstract merits of the bill, should it become a law, 
“as it is almost certain to do, Tennessee must take steps to secure her 
share of the distribution, or be taxed for the benefit of others. If, 
as has been argued, the Bill is only an artfully devised scheme for 
imposing @ new tax upon the country in the name of education, we 
‘certainly must accept the situation, and provide for securing our 
prorata. This bill provides that the net proceeds of the public 
lauds shall forever be consecrated and set apart for the education of
-P-A-G-E-20
19 
the people. It requires, however, before the States or Territories 
shall receive any portion of the fund that shall arise from the sale 
of public lands, that each one shall, by its legislature, provide by 
law for the free education of all its children between the ages of 
six and sixteen, and shall apply all moneys which it shall receive, 
under the act, in accordance with its conditions. 1t-also requires 
that an annual report be made. The law further provides that the 
‘distribution for the first ten years shall be among the several States 
‘and Territories, including the District of Columbia, in the ratio of 
the illiteracy of their respective populations. It also makes condi- 
tion that no moneys belonging to any State or Territory, under this 
Act, shall be withheld from any State or Territory for the reason 
that the laws thereof provide for separate schools for white children 
‘dr black children, or refuse to organize a system of mixed schools. 
Under this Act, should it become a law by the action of the Senate, 
the State of Tennessee will receive about $130,000. This added to 
the sum at present realized from the tax on polls, all escheated prop- 
erty, and all gifts of property to the State, the personal effects of 
intestates having no kindred, and the interest on the school fund 
of $1,500,000, will give a sum which, if supplemented by a small 
tax, will enable the people of the State to maintain a very respect- 
able school system. 
It is my deliberate judgment, hoggeger, that this additional tax 
will have to be levied ultimately by the Legislature, if a sufficiency 
of money is ever raised to establish schools of a high character and 
real merit. It has been shown that while the white population for. 
the last decade has increased but 13 per cent., ignorance has been 
increasing among that population at the rate of 50 per cent. It is 
hardly probable, therefore, that the great mass of voters in the 
State will, without.schools, become any more intelligent than at 
present; and the exertion of a community to secure schools dimin- 
ishes just as the intelligence of the community decreases. In other 
words, the tendency of ignorance is to perpetuate itself, while intel- 
ligence seeks for new fields of thought and new means of diffusing 
itself. 
‘Lregret to have to report that there is yet, in some localities. a 
strong feeling against levying a school tax, because the negroes will 
be made partakers of its benefits. It is not well for a community, 
or an individual to suffer prejudice to drive them in opposition to © 
their best interest, and highest duties. The problem presented is 
one of the gravest natufe, and should command our most serious
-P-A-G-E-21
20 
and careful consideration. By a decree of Providence the negro is 
here with us, subject to the same laws, and entitled to the same 
privileges by law. That he can be made a useful laborer and a 
quiet, peaceable citizen, no one who is acquainted with his character 
can doubt. His attachment to the place of his birth is marvellous, 
and the most powerful influences bronght to bear upon him by cor- 
rupt and designing politicians wero not able, with but few excep- 
tions, to destroy the confidence he had in the honesty and uprightness 
’ of his former owner. If his labor can be improved ; if it can be made 
more profitable to himself, his employer, and the State, the highest 
considerations of duty, charity, benevolence and patriotism demand 
that it be done. Intelligence multiplies results even in the brute. A 
horse, for example, trained to walk straight forward to. stakes in lay- 
ing off rows for the planting of corn can do a third more work in a 
day, and do it better, than one not so trained er educated. A team 
that has been disciplined can draw a far heavier load than one un- 
trained. Every farmer knows that the value of his laborer depends, 
other things being equal, upon the degree of his intelligence. Up to 
a certain point there can be no question as to the advantages to the 
employer to be derived from the education of the laborer. An edu- 
cated man can achieve greater material results than an ignorant one. 
Says the Princeton Review, in discussing this question, “some curious 
and instructive facts were cqllegted a few years ago by Horace Mann 
in regard to this matter. Hf® Inquiries were directed to the efficiency 
of operatives if factories, 4 class of men who would seem to require 
as little general intelligence as any kind of laborers. It was found that, 
_as a general rule, these operatives who could siga their names to their 
weekly receipts, were able to do one-third more work, and do it bet- 
ter than those who made their mark. Nor is this at all to be won- 
dered at. There is no kind of work done by the aid of human 
inuscle that is purely mechanical. Mind is partner in all that the 
pody does. Mind directs and controls muscle, and even in emer- 
gency gives it additional energy and power. No matter how simple 
-the process in which an operative may be engaged, some cultivation 
of hig mental power is needed. Without it he misdirects his own 
movements, and mistakes continually the orders of his superintend- 
ing workman. A boy, who has been to a good common. school, and 
> has had his mental activities quickened, and when mind has been 
_.stimulated and roused by worthy motives, not only will be more in- 
dustrious for it, when he becomes a man, but his industry will be 
more effective. He will accomplish more even as a day laborer than
-P-A-G-E-22
21 
the, mere ignorant boor. When we como to any kind of skilled 
labor, the differonce between the educated and the ignorant is still | 
more apparent. An intelligent mechanic is worth twice as much as 
one ignorant and stupid.” 
These observations of Mr. Mann is confirmed by the experienco 
of the Superintendent of the cotton factory which has recently gone 
into.operation in Nashville. Col. Sam. D. Morgan says the opera- 
tives which he has gathered from the population of Nashville, are 
pronounced by his subordinate superintendents the most efficient 
that they have ever known after a long experience, and to the com- 
mon schools of Nashville, which these persons had the benefit of, he 
ascribes their superiority as operatives. : 
Education, by diffusing kaowledge and stimulating thought, mul- 
tiplies invention, and so increases the producing power of a people, 
Any invention that doubles the product of labor is a benéfit to the 
whole community.’ Many labor-saving inventions are so simple that 
they are never patented, and yet they are valuable. 
A very instructivé case, where intelligence was applied to the 
ordinary operations on the farm came under my own observation. 
A young. sprightly negro man, who had received the rudiments of 
an education, was required to clear the leaves from a piece of wood- 
land preparatory to the sowing of grass. He ingeniously constructed) 
in a-few minutes, an apparatus resembling somewhat a hay rake, 
with which he performed the labor of two or three hands in clearing 
away the leaves, and at the same time scratched the land for the 
better reception of the seed. When asked where he had seen such 
an apparatus, he replied, ‘“I-never saw one before—I just thought it 
out.’” . 
The Hon, Wm.-H. Ruffner, the able Superintendent of Public In- 
struction for the State of Virginia, in his First Annual Report dis- 
cusses this question in its economical light with great power and 
ability, and I cannot do better than to appropriate his argument, 
and make it applicable to the State of Tennessee, 
Every person in his normal condition has a certain intrinsic value 
to the State, and publicists have long been trying to determine what 
that average value is. The public value of a common laborer has 
been commonly placed at $1,000. Mr. Young, the Chief of the Bu- 
reau of Statistics, shows by conclusive reasoning that $800 is nearer 
the true value. This supposes the man to be worth that sum over 
and above the support of a wife and two children. The value of a 
man, says Mr. Ruffner, being his productive power, minus his run- r
-P-A-G-E-23
22 
ning expenses, of course the average is affected by his dogree of 
skill and power, and by every thing that enters into his physical, 
moral and mental character. If a man, with a wife and two chil- 
dren, can earn $400 a year, and pay expenses, and then leaves a 
profit of $40, he will be worth $800, for $40 capitalized at 5 per cent. 
gives $800. Our negro men do not earn so much, but take the num- 
ber to be 50,000, at that rate they are worth $40,000,000. Whatever 
amount be assumed as the value, 4 very slight change in their aver- 
age character produces a largo result in the increase or diminution 
in the wealth of the State. Ifthe average value be reduced to $600, 
the wealth of the State is reduced by $10,000,000. If the average 
could be raised to $1,000, $10,000,000 would be added to the wealth 
of the State. Now take the annual income. If each laborer adds 
$40 to the wealth of the State, 50,000 will add $2,000,000. Now, 
suppose he could be made to eain $10 additional, a sum would be 
realized nearly equal in amount to the largest expenditure ever 
made in one year in this State for school purposes. By increasing 
or.diminishing the productive capacity of the laboring population, 
the annual growth or wealth of the State is powerfully affected. 
Collecting the testimonies as to the addition made to the efficiency 
of labor by education, it is found that 25 per cent. at least is sup- 
posed to be added by that means, and this without taking into 
account the constantly increasing value of that class that rises above 
the existing condition. If the negro is not an exception to this rule, 
$8,000,000 would be added directly to the State, and $500,000 to their 
gross annual product by education, to say nothing of what would 
be added indirectly. As the laborers increase in value, every thing 
that depends on labor rises in proportion—lands, mines, water 
power, &c., &c. 
Another view: If there are no schools in the country, while 
schools are kept up in towns, farm labor will become scarce and dear, 
and the profits of the farming community will be proportionately 
decreased. The most worthless, those who do not value edu- 
cation will constitute the only available labor for the farm. Let 
school houses be erected in every part of the country, and the amount 
saved in the price of labor will pay a large school tax every year. 
to say nothing of the increased contentment and efficiency of the 
laborer. Admit, for the sake of argument, that the negro is imbe- 
cile, and cannot be improved intellectually, still it will be a profit- 
able investment to gratify his inclinations and laudable ambition to 
seo his children enjoying the privileges of attending schools, To
-P-A-G-E-24
23 
show that these views are not altogether theoretical, reference is 
made to the statements, in another part of this report, in relation to 
the prices paid by the farmers in Montgomery county, and those 
paid by the farmers in tho adjoining counties in Kentucky. There 
are about 2,000 of these laborers in the county of Montgomery. A 
saving of twenty-five dollars on each would give the sum of $50,000, 
a sum four times as great as the amount collected in that county for 
school purposes. Here, by the investment of $12,500, a clear gain 
of $37,500 is made. This only applies to the saving in farm labor, 
but there is a corresponding reduction in the. prices for house 
servants, cooks, carriage drivers, &c. So that it will be seen that as. 
an investment the levying of a school tax, and the keeping up of 
schools for that class of our population pays a very large dividend. 
Education has become absolutely indispensable to the material 
prosperity of any community. The machines which are now in 
common use on the farm, in the workshop, by the fireside, on the 
streams, on the ocean, presuppose some knowledge of methanics in 
order to operate them. More cultivation of intellect is required to 
manage a reaper, or a thresher than to use the sickle, or to beat out 
grain with a flail. And as.the introduction of machinery into the 
operations of the farm is becoming more general each year, so @ 
larger degree of intelligence is constantly demanded there. The 
senseless exercise of muscle cannot compete with the precision and 
intelligent action of machinery. Hach succeeding year will show a 
diminished demand for ignorant labor and an increased inquiry for 
skilled labor. The highest interest of the State, then, demands a 
recognition of this fact, and the adoption of some measures by 
which tho laborer may be instructed in the higher requirements of 
the farm, for all the experience of this country goes to prove that it 
is-more economical to employ intelligent labor and use machinery 
than dispense with machinery and use ignorant labor. The pro- 
duction of cotton since the invention of the cotton gin, the in- 
ereased production of wheat since the invention of the reaper, 
are cases in point; and so far from machinery reducing-the average 
price of labor, the producing power of a day’s labor is greater 
now than it ever has been; employment is more constant; sales 
of agri€altural products more certain; and a gradual elevation 
of the laborer in the scale of dignity and intelligence more decided 
where machinery is used and the laborer is educated. Indeed it 
may be affirmed that sailors, mechanics, seamstresses, and all classes 
who live by manual labor, as well as farmers, are compelled to have .__ 
i

-P-A-G-E-25
24 
more knowledge now than a half century ago. An ignorant people 
in this age are compelled by an inexorablé law to be poor. No rich- 
ness of soil, no radiance of the sky, no commercial facilities, no 
mineral wealth, can confer greatness and honor on a people inca- 
pacited by ignorance. It has been well said that whatever wealth 
is showered upon such a people will run to waste. “The ignorant — 
pearl divers do not wear the pearls they win. The diamond hunters 
are not ornamented by the gems they find. The miners for silver 
and: gold are not enriched by the precious metals they dig. Those 
who till the most luxuriant soils are not filled with the harvests 
they gather. All the choicest productiens of the earth, whether 
mineral or vegetable, wherever found, or wherever gathered, willin 
a short time, as by some secret and resistless attraction, make their 
way into the hands of the more intelligent. Let whoever will sow 
the seed, or gather the fruit, intelligence will consume the banquet.” 
Give education, and you give the keys to unlock. the treasures of 
the world. Nothing desirable in the depths of the ocean, or in the 
bowels of the earth, or in the atmosphere above, but can be obtained 
by its aid. New agencies and new powers of nature are harnessed, 
and made to do the biddings of man. Refuse education and you 
refuse every thing—social elevation, moral grandeur, civil and reli- 
gious liberty, virtue, integrity and power, and good government. 
Deny it, and there is no other “open sesame.” under heaven to open 
the doors of the varied wealth of the universe. Man becomes but 
an instinctive brute, toiling to live, and living only to die. His in- 
tellect is darkened with a cloud more threatening than that, rifted 
by the thunderbolt; more terrible than that which surrounds the 
apex of a burning volcano, and more disastrous than the whirlwind; 
for it is the cloud of ignorance that shuts out all the lights of civili- 
zation, of the treasures of science, and the blessings of rational ex- 
istence. : 
To sum up, then: A large amount necessary to educate the chil- 
dren of the State could be deducted from the amount now expended 
for crime. A large amount, if not all, could be gained by increasing 
the average productive capacity of the population. A large amount 
eould be saved by the increased security given to property. An 
equivalent could be added by the benefits rendered society in itPeleva- 
tion, and in the increased rational enjoy ments which a judicious sys- 
tem of education would insure. Tothis might be added the worth to 
the community of every intelligent man and woman that would be 
attracted to the State; the enhancement of the price of property
-P-A-G-E-26
25 
consequent thereupon; the utilization of the forces of nature through’ 
the agency of such a population; the cultivation of those qualities 
of honesty, honor, courage and gallantry that distinguish the civil- 
ized from the savage, the boor fromthe gentleman, the Christian from 
the heathen. Such a system of public instruction will make our 
State attractive. It will revive patriotism by enlisting the affecticns 
and sympathies and pride of the eitizen. “To make us love our 
country,” says Burke, “we must make our country lovely.” And 
to epitomize and appropriate another sentiment of this great English 
statesman and scholar, good education subdues the fierceness of 
pride and power; it obliges rulers to submit to the soft collar of 
social esteem; it compels stern authority to submit to clegance; it 
ennobles whatever it touches, and strips vice of half its evil by de- 
* stroying all its groseness. 
y 
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. 
The short time that I have held my present position, and the hur- 
ried manner in which this report has been prepared, make it mani- 
festly improper that I should suggest any sweeping changes in the 
present system. It must be evident, however, to any one who will 
examine the reports from the various counties, hereto appended, 
that the system as it at present exists is utterly devoid of vitality, 
and is wholly unsuited for. the accomplishment of the great pur- 
poses of education. The objections to it are the want of suitable 
provisions to secure : . 
First. Unity of action throughout the State ; 
Second. The creation of a livelier interest among the people of 
the State in educational matters ; 
Third. A larger amount of energy in the systom; 
Fourth. More frequent and more reliable statistics from each 
county. 
As to the best methods of securing these desirable ends, it would 
perhaps be better to refer the whole subject to the wisdom of our 
present Legislature, but I will venture to suggest two recommenda- 
tions which the friends of education throughout the State agree to 
be necessary. 
1, The appointment of a competent State Superintendent, with a 
salary sufficient to enable him to devote his whole time and ability to 
the following: 
First. The creation of a sentiment in the State favorable to public 
education ; and
-P-A-G-E-27
26 
Second. To the building up, as that feeling i increases, of an effect- 
_ ive school system. 
Without such an officer the whole county system will prove a stu- 
pendous failure, to the lasting injury and deep disgrace. of the 
present generation. 
2. Provision tor the appointment of a Superintendent in each 
county as schools are organized. The dutics of such an officer should 
be precisely for the school districts what the duties of the State 
officer should be for the counties. He should travel from district to 
district, encouraging the friends of schools by keeping them in- 
formed as to the progress of schools in other counties, by supplying . 
them with facts in reference to school management and school laws. 
He should stimulate the people to build good school-houses, to send 
their children to the schools. He should also endeavor to creato a 
feeling of pride and emulation among the School Commissioners in 
the various districts, and, indeed, do everytning necessary to carry 
out the purposes of the law. And in order that he may do this, he 
should be paid a liberal salary, and elothed with sufficient powers. 
Much of this power is now vested in the County Board of Educa- 
tion, This for celerity of action is too unwieldy. As the law 
makes no provision for the payment of the Commissioners for their 
services, it is difficult to get a sufficient number together in the 
Board to form a quorum. It requires too long a timo to act, 
and when it does act, it is generally with a divided senti- - 
ment among the members. Its decrees are therefore but feebly 
executed. The sense of responsibilty is divided and destroyed on 
such a body, and the voice of praise or censure is alike unheeded. 
No scope is given to individual ambition. The work demanded to 
be done is great, but the remuneration is small. Far better would 
it be to concentrate the responsibility and power into the hands of 
a competent Superintendent, and demand of him certain specific 
duties to be promptly and faithfully discharged. 
Until a better feeling in regard to public schools is established, it” 
would perhaps be well to permit the County Superintendents to 
appoint the Commissioners in each district. There are some good 
reasons for suggesting this course: first, the people are so apathetic 
and indifferent about. schools that it is difficult to get them to hold 
an election for Commissioners; and second when Commissioners are 
elected, they are usually satisfied with the honor bestowed, and if 
they serve at all, serve but poorly. Sometimes, however, they are
-P-A-G-E-28
on. 
in antagonism to the school interest, and work to defeat it at the 
next election. Either apathy or ill-will is generally the result of 
such an election. If the Superintendent had the power to appoint 
them, the whole county could be more rapidly organized; the best 
men could be selected for the position, and if one refused to serve, 
another could be appointed without going through the expense and 
farce of an election, and a more harmonious working and develop- 
ment of the system could be secured. The Superintendent should 
be elected by the people, because his position is, or should be one of 
honor and profit. Not so with the Commissioners. Their work is 
laborious They must or should feel a deep interest upon the sub- 
ject of schools, and the best men should be selected for that position 
—men who will work for the good of the cause, and who will feel 
the heavy responsibility resting upon them. These Commissioners 
“should visit every family and present to their consideration the im- 
portance of the subject to their individual prosperity. In short, the 
whole labor of building up publie schools should be sytematized by 
regarding the county as the unit in the work of the State Superin- 
tendent; and the school district as the unit in the work of the 
County Superintendent; and the family as the unit in the work of 
the Commissioners. 
The meagerness of the reports given is sufficient toc convince any 
one that some other method should be devised to collect the scho- 
lastic statisties of the counties. The Clerks of the County Courts 
have duties enough to perform, and no one could do the work as- 
signed them so well as a County Superintendent, who in going from 
_ district to district, encouraging the schools and stimulating the citi- 
zens, could perform this duty more effectually. ‘The business of 
education must be stimulated. It must not be left as other things 
to the laws of trade. Those who most need its benefits and civili- 
zing influences are precisely those who take the least interest 
in, and feel the least need of .it, Unlike hunger or cold, it 
dpes not force itself upon the attention, but is none the less needful 
for all that. Casper Hauser, who spent his life in darkness and 
silence, could conceive of no higher pleasures than he enjoyed until 
the glories of the external world were revealed to his gaze. These 
glories existed, notwithstanding his ignorance. Man must be lifted 
up to the higher enjoyments of life. His own debased nature will 
never direct him upward. <A fearful responsibility rests upon every 
community that fails to apply those means for the removal of igno- 
rance, with its concomitant vices, stupidity and superstition and

vagabondism, that experience proves to be best and shows to be 
necessary. Let us hope, sir, that ere long Tennessee will take a 
step in this matter that will reveal to the world the transcendent 
, brightness of the intellects of her sons and daughters. Let us hope 
that her action in the matter may be such as to command the re- 
spect, and awaken the gratitude; and secure the admiration of pos- 
terity.

‘An election was held in this county on the first Saturday in March 
to take the sense of the voters as to levying a tax for school pur- 
poses. The proposition. to levy such a tax was voted down. Very

BLEDSOE. 
This county voted a tax in 1871 of 3 cents on the hundred dollars 
worth of property, and 25 cents on the poll. The whole amount 
realized is only $707 00, a sum too smail to effect much good. At the 
January Term, 1872, the Court voted a tax of 5 cents on the $100, 
and 25 cents on polls. Commissioners have been elected, but no 
schools are in operation, the amount of money being sufficient only 
to keep the schools open fiom one to two months in the year. 
The scholastic population amounted at the last report to 1 524, of 
whom 212 were colored, and 1,312 white. 
: BLOUNT. 
The question of taxation for schools was submitted to the people 
on the first Saturday in March. and lost by 87 majority. 
BRADLEY. 
The schools were organized in this county on the last of March, 
1871, and reports from private sources inform us that the schools are 
doing well in every part of the county. Aid has been procured 
from the Peabody Fund for many of the schools. There is a graded 
school at Cleveland, which is represented as being in a healthy con- 
dition. It was érganized four years ago, and in discipline, classifi- 
cation and arrangement, is rapidly reaching a high standard. 
A tax of twenty cents on the $100 was levied for the year 1871, 
and commissioners have been elected in every district. There are 
forty schools in operation. Hight of those schools are kept open for 
ten months, and the remaining ones from three to five months. 
The scholastic population is reported by commissioners to be 
3,479, of whom 582 are colored. Ht is thought, however, that.an 
error was made in taking the population, and that it will amount 
fully to 5,000. 
It is thought that with a little ericouragement the county can be 
made to take a very high stand in the great work.

CARROLL. 
The proposition to levy a tax for common schools was overwhelm- 
ingly defeated at the election on Saturday, the 2d of March. The 
reasons for this result are found mainly in the fact that our school 
laws are generally regarded there as being fatally defective, insomuch 
that the school tax, if collected and consumed under our present 
system, could be productive of but little benefit.

Nasuvittz, March 8, 1872. 
Dr. W. Morrow: : 
Dear Sir: In reply to your inquiries with reference to the 
Public Schools of Davidson county, I have to report, that our County 
Court levies a tax of two mills on property, and one-half mill on 
privileges, for school purposes, which aggregates annually « ‘fund of 
about $90,000; that the Commissioners are regularly elected from 
every civil district, constituting Board of Education for the county 
and that I am at present the County Superintendent. 
There are 91 white and 28 colored, total 119 schools in operation. 
They are open in the country districts nine months in the year, and 
in the first and seventeenth districts ten months. The total number 
enrolled is 6,640, and the scholastic population of the county is 
17,725. : 
The first and seventeenth districts levy a tax in addition to the 
above, and have control of their educational interests under a sepa- 
rate organization—Boards of Education and Superintendents. I 
have not the report from the latter at hand, but append below a 
condensed statement from the Superintendent of First District. 
Respectfully, . SAM’L DONELSON, 
County Superintendent. 
Dr. W. Morrow: 
Dear Sir: Nashville established a system of public schools 
in 1852, and supported them by a municipal tax, almost entirely, until 
the present school law took effect. We now receive from the County 
Trustee about $25,000 annually, and by a levy of two mills on prop- 
erty, and one-fourth mill on privileges, and from polls, raise about 
$30,000 more; making our yearly expenditures about $55,000. Our Board of Education consists of nine members, three of whom are

elected yearly, and the Superintendent, as their executive officer, 
directs and controls the schools.

DECATUR. 
A tax of 20 cents on the $100 has recently been voted by a large 
majority. Ten or twelve schools for the white children were in 
operation for three or four months during the year 1871, but none 
for the colored children. About 300 pupils attended the white 
achools. 
The scholastic population amounts 2,453, of whom 229 are colored

The Magistrates voted a tax of 15. cents on the $100, and half the

Fifteen out of the seventeen districts elected Commissioners. 
No schools were in operation on the 20th of February. There are 
‘in the county 40 public school-houses. The schools can be carried . 
on about three months in the year with the funds derived from the 
present rate of taxation. 
There are 2,008 white, and 178 colored children in the county, 
which compose the scholastic population.

. This county refused to vote a school tax. Commissioners have 
been elected, but there are no schools in operation. The poll tax for 
1870 amounted to $1,700, which when prorated among the scholars 
between six and eighteen years, shows about 40 cents per scholar, 
and there being no other fund there have been no schools. When

This county has done nobly, levying a tax for the year 1872 of 40 
Genta on the $100 of taxable property, and fifty cents on the poll for 
school purposes. Commissioners have been elected and the schools 
will be put in operation just as soon as collections begin. They will 
be kept up at least three months. ‘The scholastic population for the 
year 1871 was 1669, Complaint is made that the Commissioners do 
not meet the requirements of the law in forwarding their reports to 
the County Court Clerk.

This county has voted a. tax of 25 cents on the $100. But few’ 
Commissioners were elected up to the first of February. No other 
information is given. The Magistrates have not been furnished with

GIBSON. 
This county is laying a broad and solid foundation for her school 
system. The County Court; at its January term levied a tax of 25 
cents on the $100, arid increased the poll tax to $2 00, which is by 
law set apart for school purposes. Commissioners have been elected 
in every district. It is thought that the County Court will levy a 
tax next January so as to keep up the schools ten months in the 
year. The schools have been opened only partially. But prepara- 
tions are being made to open them all in August next. 
The scholastic population which was reported on the 30th of June,
-P-A-G-E-36

2,153. Grand total, 8,026. 
On the 5th of February, the Board of Hducation met, Col. L, P. 
McMurray, President, and A. 8. Currey, Secretary and Suaperin- 
tendent, 
The Superintendent submitted the following report, which, on 
motion of M. Whitten, was received and referred to a committee of 
five, to report at the next meeting: 
To rue Scoot ComMissionEers or Grason County: 
On the last Thursday in December a meeting of the Board of Ed- 
ucation was attempted to be held, as required by law, but for want 
of a quorum—only eight districts being represented—the Commis- 
sioners were unable to transact any business; but by a unanimous 
vote requested the President and Secretary to urge the County Court 
to levy a tax of not less than 25 cents for common school purposes. 
The County Court at its January term very generously and with 
almost entire unanimity acceded to this request, and levied a tax of 
25 cents on the $100, upon all taxables, and increased the poll tax 
to $2, which by law is to be set apart for public schools. The Com. 
missioners, at the rame meeting, deemed it advisable to call another 
meeting of the Board of Education on the first Monday in February 
and accordingly you have been notified and requested to meet to-day, 
for the purpose of perfecting your organization as a Board and 
preparing to commence operations as early as practicable under the 
present public school system. Although the school fund to be raised 
during the present year is not as much as the friends of Public Edu- 
cation would deem necessary to kéep in operation our Public Schools, 
yet in view of the onerous taxes upon the people, it was thought 
thata half loaf would be better than none, and that the amount 
realized from all sources would be sufficient for at least five months 
during the year. The taxable property of Gibson county last year 
was valued. by your assessors at $6,475,536. With a similar valua- 
_ tion for 1872, the tax al 25c will yield a school fund of $16,188.84, 
and the poll tax ($2) an additional sum of $7,478.00, amountiug. in 
all to $22,666.84. We may very safely estimate that the School Fund 
to be collected for the present year, from all sources, including the 
ad valorem tax and the tax upon privileges, yet to be levied, will 
. not be less than $25,000. But under the present law the collection 
of this tax, except upon privileges, will not commence until the first 
of October next, and we cannot possibly depend upon one half ot
-P-A-G-E-37
36 
the amount being collected before the first of January. These facts 
should be considered by the Commissioners, in connection with the 
proper time to commence the public schools. There is much anxiety 
on the part of the people to begin now, in fact some of the Commis-" 
sioners have already opened their “free schools” with the small 
means on hand. Is not this premature, and can it give satisfaction 
unless it igs generally applied in the district? ‘Others again have 
very judiciously reserved their funds until a sufficient amount can 
be accumulated to put the public schools of their districts in success- 
ful operation. These districts, we may reasonably expect, will have 
flourishing schools while the former will languish and droop for want 
of the means which they have prematurely expended upon particu- 
lar localities. It is a matter of great importance to our public 
school system that some unanimity should be observed as to the time 
of. commencing our schools, and in the mode of instruction, which 
embraces not only the discipline but the series of text-books to be 
used throughout the county. Let us then perfect all our arrange- 
ments with a view to commencing all our public schools upon some 
day agreed upon throughout the whole county, not sooner, however, 
than the first day of July next. Harlier than this, I think would be 
impracticable. In the meantime we can select a suitable series of 
school-books to be used in all the schools, prescribe the limit of in- 
struction adapted to the means at our command, adopt the necessary 
rules for the government of the schools, construct good and commo- 
dious school-houses convenient to the people of your districts, elect 
and employ competent teachers, and the duties of your Superin- 
tendent should be defined, so as to instruct and co-operate with the 
School Commi-sioners of each district, and he should be required to 
visit and inspect the management of each of the schools. If we 
wish to accomplish any good with our public schools, we must begin 
right, and let the whole system be carried on simultaneously. If 
our public school system is a success or failure, the credit or blame 
is due to the School Commissioners themselves, and with the system 
itself. Our aim should be to make our public schools better than 
any we have heretofore had. If they are inferior to other schools, 
they will fail to give satisfaction to the people and accomplish the 
purposes for which they were designed.

The Board then adjourned until the last Thursday in March, 
owing to the County Court being in session. 
The interest manifested by the people of Gibson in her public 
schools is very great, and contrasts favorably with the apathy and 
indifference shown by other counties, whofe degree of ignorance is 
tenfold greater than in Gibson. «Her action, however, upon this 
subject only insures, what was before highly probable, that it will 
in afew years become the wealthiost county in West Tennessee, 
Shelby only excepted. Her example is heartily commended to those 
counties that are still lingering in the gall of bitterness and bonds of 
ignorance. , 
GILES. 
No report, though we understand from a private source that the 
school tax has recently been rejected. The greatest objection to the 
levying of a school tax isthe number of negroes in this county, who 
will, it is thought, reap the greatest advantages from such a tax. 
Other citizens are of opinion that schools will make them still more 
inefficient and unreliable as laborers. Time alone will dissipate this 
error. : 
GRAINGER, 
Has voted no school tax, but Commissioners have been elected, 
and three schools are in operation in the county. 
' There are 3,200 children reported in the county between six and 
eightcen years of age, of whom 24 are colored. 
No other information given. The Clerk expresses the belief that 
the people are kindly disposed to public schools, but need instruction 
in the matter. A specific plan of organization is wanted, which he 
will find in the publication of the school laws sent him for distribu- 
tiom among the magistrates.

HANCOCK.’ 
This county has levied a small tax for school purposes—10 cents 
onthe $100, As might be expected with so small an amount, no 
Commissioners have been elected, and no statistics have been col- 
lected. _ 
The step, however, is in the right direction, as the Court last year 
refused to levy any tax. “Let it be known, once for all, that to make 
public schools popular, a sufficient tax should be levied to make 
them capable of accomplishing the ends for which they are intended, 
the instruction and elevation of the children of the country. 
HARDEMAN. 
Commissioners have been elected in this county, but with little to 
do, as the county has voted no school tax. The scholastic popula-

subject of public instruction.

It is thought these schools can be kept up with the present levy five 
or six months a year. 
Scholastic population, 8,292. 
LOUDON. 
This county has done nothing but elect a few Commissioners. 
MACON. 
No tax levied. No schools, Commissioners elected in eight out of 
the twelve districts in the county. Eight districts report a scholastic 
population—whites, 1,015; colored 154. Total 1,162. 
MADISON. 
Nothing done. Magistrates have failed or refused to recognize 
the existence of the school law.. It is thought, however, that some 
action will be taken in a short time. 
McMINN. 
An election was ordered to take the sense of the people as to 
voting a tax for school purposes. It takes place sometime in March. 
The Clerk of the County Court expresses the opinion that it will be 
voted down. Nothing done—not even an enumeration made of the 
scholastic population.

the longest time schools have been kept up. The amount which 
will be realized from the school tax for 1872 will reach $4, 900. 
Scholastic population in 1871, 7,386. 
The Clerk of the County Court manifests quite an interest in 
school matters, and asks who is to control the schools? The 'Com- 
missioners of common schools of cach civil district controls all mat- 
ters pertaining to schools in their district, subject, of course, to the 
action of the Board of Education, which is composed of the Com- 
missioners from every district in the county. 
MARION. 
Thirty conte on the $100 was levied for public instruction in 1871 
also ali the poll tax. From this the amount of $4,497.04 was col- 
ected. A few of the districts have failed to elect Commissioners. 
The scholastic population from ‘only the 3d, 4th, 6th and 8th dis- 
tricts has been reported, which amounts in these. districts to 855- 
A county that has levied such a liberal tax should surely. be able to 
find persons who will act as Commissioners. 
MARSHALL. 
The Magistrates have-virtually ignored the existence of the achool 
laws—neither levying a tax nor submitting the same to a vote of the 
people. 
MAURY. 
This county has levied.a tax sufficient to raise about five thousand 
dollars, which, added to the amount now on hand, some seven thou- 
sand dollars, will give about twelve thousand dollars for eemmon 
school purposes for the present year. Commissioners have been 
elected in all the districts, and schools will probably be opened in 
every district.in a short time. 
MEIGS, 
No school tax voted, But few schools of any kind in operation, 
1,691 were reported as belonging to the scholastic population. 
MONROE. 
Nothing done. A private letter says: 
“Tt is folly to organize, or even to attempt to organize a system 
of schools, while the County Court controls the matter. I have not 
the most distant idea that they will ever assess a tax for that pur- 
pose.
-P-A-G-E-45

If the State would inaugurate a system, and Iovy a tax, we pos- 
sibly might take a start in the right direction. Our citizens never 
complained of the school tax. We had flourishing schools until the 
money was all squandered, and those who had been employed as 
veachers were forced to sacrifice their claims, became disgusted with 
the management, and retired from the occupation. I can offer you 
no encouragement for the future, without you can infuse some ener- 
gy and life in our Coust.” 
MONTGOMERY. 
This county voted for common schools for the year 1870, $12,076.30, 
and for 1871, $13,946.79. 
Commissioners have been elected in all the school districts i in the 
county. 
There are ne schools now in operation. It was thought best to 
wait antil collections were made. 
There were taught in 1870 about sixty schools in the county five 
months, and for the year 1871 about the same number, sixty, for two 
and a half months, which exhausted the funds on hand, and the 
Commissioners have discontinued the schools. 
The delay in the collection of taxes was the sole cause of the sus- 
penpension of the schools. It was found impossible to meet the just 
demands of the teachers with the amount of taxes collected. These 
schools gave satisfaction in every part,of the county, and the only 
drawback to them has been the tardiness with which collections 
were made. The susponsion after teaching only two and a half 
months gave rise to a good many complaints, but no plan could be 
devised to keep up the schools, and pay tho teachers, except to col- 
lect the tax.

OBION. 
A vote was taken in this county on the first Saturday in March 
to ascertain the wishes of the people as to levying a school tax, 
which resulted in its defeat. 40 white schools and 4 colored were 
kept open five months in the year. 
The Clerk of the County Court writes: 
“The report of the scholastic population, ending 1st October, 1871, 
has not been handed in fully as it was for 1870, therefore I have 
been waiting for same, and will not be able to get it from the fact 
that quite a number of Commissioners in different districts have 
‘resigned, and it is avery hard matter to get othors to accept or to 
take hold of the matter, as they say there is a penalty for non-per- 
formance of duties, and no pay in the same; do not understand the 
Jaw, and a hundred other things and objections. Scholastic popula- 
tion 6,000; and that is all I can report, save there is but very little 
interest taken in the cause of public instruction, as a great many 
think it a failure, or a system incomplete.” 
OVERTON. 
The vote was submitted by the Court on the 10th of February 
last. The result.106 for it, and 500 against it. There was a Rail- 
road tax submitted the same day, one cause why the vote for the 
schogl tax was so small. Also the people do not like the present 
system of laws regulating common schools ; believe it a waste of their 
money. The hardness of the times and great scarcity of money 
also proved a great barrior to the voting of the tax. 
- PERRY. 
The Clerk of the County Court in response to inquiries writes : 
In regard to Common Schools in Perry county, I am sorry to in- 
form you that they are almost entirely neglected. There has been 
no organization since the war. We have a few schools carried on 
by subscription, and one academic school. Our county has not 
voted a tax for support of schools, and the scholastic population of 
this county has not been reported to me for 1872. 
POLK. 
Voted a school tax of 20 cents on the $100, realizing therefrom 
$2,352.18. Commissioners have been elected in eight districts out of 
ten. Several schools taught since July, 1871, but no report of the 
number made.

Scholastic population reported, 1,201.’ The Clerk says in the con- 
clusion of his report: 
It might be proper for me to state that the sheriff has advertised, 
time and again, in some of the districts, and no one to be found who 
would have the Commissioner’s place. 
On the first Monday in January the County Court voted down a 
a school tax, but ordered an election for the people to decide whether 
they would have a tax assessed for school purposes or not. 
PUTNAM. 
No report. 
RHEA. 
Nothing has heen done except to elect Commissioners in three 
districts. The Trustee for the County holds $400 in State warrants, 
and $265 arising from poll tax for school purposes. . 
ROANES. 
Levied a tax in January, 1871, of ten cents on the $100 for schools. 
A much larger tax would have been levied but for the fact that the 
county had to meet its obligation fora Poor house farm, It isthoyght 
that 20 cents will be levied for school purposes in April, 1872. Com- 
missioners were elected in every part of the county, and an increased 
and growing interest is felt on the subject. Very few schools were 
in operation during the past year because it was thought best to 
collect the money before expending it. , 
ROBERTSON. 
The proposition to levy a tax was voted down on the fourth Sat- 
urday in March. Nothing done. There is, however, a growing 
feeling in favor of public schools, especially in the towns. The friends 
of education feel confident that the action of the people in rejecting 
a schoo! tax will be revorsed when the subject is more thoroughly 
studied and canvassed.

SEQUATCHIE 
Has levied a tax of 30 cents on the $100 worth of taxable property, 
and 50 cents on each poll for public instruction for the year 1872 
Commissioners were elected in August, 1871. The fall schools hav- 
ing closed about ‘Christmas, there are no schools in operation at 
present. They will be resumed about the first of July. 
The amount raised by local taxation will enable the schools to con- 
tinue in operation about five months annually, in each of the 14 
‘school districts in the county. 
The scholastic population as reported on the 30th of June, 1871, 
numbered 779; 
The Commissioners have not organized themselves in a County 
Board of Education, but it is thought they will do so at an early day. 
No tax was levied last’ year and of course but little interest taken 
in public schools..

The magistrates have taken no action. Majority of citizens are

The public school system of Memphis has been in operation nine- 
teen years. The eighteenth annual report showed an average en- 
rollment of 3,409, with an average attendance of 1,850. The school 
department of the city government is managed by a Board of School 
Visitors, two from each ward, who are elected annually. A regu- 
lar course of graded study is prescribed. Ancient and modern 
languages and the higher mathematics are taught in the High 
Schools. The salaries of Superintendent, Teachers, etc., have aver- 
aged about as follows: Superintendent, $175 per month; Secretary, 
$100 per month; Principal of Male High School, $150 per month; 
Principal of Female High School, $125 per month; Male Principals 
of other schools, $100 per month; Male Teachers, from $100 to

The Clerk is of opinion that it would be better if the county does 
‘not levy a-school tax, to have no money at al], as the amount dis- 
tributed by the State is so small as to serve no good purpose and 
operates.only as a discouragement to private enterprises. 
  SULLIVAN. 
The County Court of this county refused to levy a tax, but subs 
mitted to the public the question of levying an ad valorem tax of 20 
cents on the $100 worth of property, which was lost.

Commissioners have been elected in a mdjority of the districts, but 
take but little interest in the matter. The Clerk in reply to the in- 
terrogatories says: 
«The system in our eounty is in a disorganized condition in 
consequence of the constant.changes in the school laws, the 
effects of the war, &«, &e. Our Court-hotse has been destroyed 
by fire, with all the records pertaining to the school system, and 
notwithstanding efforts to organize have been made, no organization 
has as yet been effected. 
“Tam unable to state how many schools are in actual operation 
at thistime. Our county is divided into about 60 scholastic districts, 
in each of which school-houses have been erected, and I would sup- 
pose that at this time schools are in operation in about half of these * 
districts, all of which are white—no colored schools in the county.. 
“The schools by a general estimate are not kept open more than 
five months in the year. 
“T am unable to say how many pupils are enrolled. 
“The scholastic population has been partially reported, and tho : 
same was reported to the Comptroller accordingly within the time 
prescribed by law. 
“Tho aggregate amount of which, as will be scen by reference to 
said report, is 3,972 
“T find by an ‘interview with the Secretary of Board of Education 
for this county, that the Commissioners of Civil District No. 3, sub- 
district No. 2, had filed a report of the scholastic population of said 
district with the Board, but not in my office, which, if you éan, I 
would be glad if you will insert same in report on file. Number of 
population in said district, whites, 99; colored, 7; aggregate, 106; 
which added to amount heretofore reported of 3,972, makes the sum 
of 4,078, as number of scholastic population reported by Commia- — 
sioners,”

of pupils enrolled about 60 to each school. Scholastic population 
about 3,500.

gaged in building up a good system of schools.

No tax. Commissioners clected. About fifty schools are reported 
as being in operation, but private ones are probably intended. Scho- 
lastic population about 5,000. 
WAYNE. 
The County Court has neither levied a tax nor submitted the ques- 
tion of a levy to the people. Commissioners have been elected, but 
take no interest in public instruction, the surest way in the world 
to deprive the people of these educational facilities to which they 
are entitled. It is precisely the case of Judges who will hold no 
Courts, or of legislators who will never mect. No information is 
given, except that thirteon districts report a scholastic population 
of 3,014, 
The Clerk thinks the only way in which public publie schools can 
succeed in Wayne is to have the whole matter compulsory, both as to 
raising funds and laying off school districts. He thinks parents and 
guardians would also have to be compelled to send their children to 
achool.. A County Superintendent is especially needed.

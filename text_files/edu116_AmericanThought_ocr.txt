FOREWORD 
We, as a country, have been told that we have no 
philosophy, that we do but reflect the speculations of 
other lands. This is not wholly true. We have had phi- 
losophers, original thinkers who, though their influence 
may not have reached abroad, were makers of history 
at home. So a study of the speculative movements in 
America leads to a clearer understanding of our national 
character, for these very movements are so closely allied 
to our history and our literature that they may be said 
to form a background for both. 
The colonial background I have presented in a pre- 
vious volume—American Philosophy: The Early Schools. 
This described the most important forms of thought as 
they crossed from the Old to the New World, developed 
during two centuries, and slowly prepared the way for 
the native philosophy of Emerson. The present work 
condenses the previous account and continues the de- 
velopment of national thought until it emerges tri- 
umphantly in pragmatism—a typical American phi- 
losophy.

   AMERICAN THOUGHT 
CHAPTER I 
PURITANISM 
1. PHmosopHy AND POoLiTics, FROM ABSOLUTIS 
Democracy 
Tur influence of philosophy upon politics in Ame 
is easily seen in the evolution of such a familiar phré 
as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Th 
declaration of independence was derived indirectly, by 
way of reaction, from a declaration of dependence. / The 
belief of the Puritans was a belief in passivity, determin- 
ism, and pessimism. They considered that man was a 
mere worm, a dull instrument in the hands of Deity; 
that his acts were predestined, Deity foreordaining 
whatsoever comes to pass; that his life was a vain show, 
and nature a vale of tears. “Over against these lugu- 
brious doctrines of the Puritans we may put those of 
their successors. It was the deists who believed in 
activity, freedom, and optimism. They held that man 
was a real agent; that he was free to do what he chose; 
that his goal was perfection itself, and they even went 
so far as to say that whatever is, is right. These beliefs 
slowly spread among the people and were gradually trans- 
lated into the plain language of the day. Instead of 
passivity the deists believed in activity,—that is, life; 
instead of determinism they believed in freedom,—that

    PURITANISM 
berty; instead of pessimism they believed in opti- 
—that is, the pursuit of happiness. In short, be- 
the Boston Platform of 1680 and the Declaration 
ependence of 1776 a marked change had come 
The deistic sun had arisen, dispelling the winter 
an discontent. Humanity was considered per- 
and this world the best of all possible worlds. 
e striking instance of the influence of philosophy 
lities is seen in the problem of political sov- 
Popular government in this country was 
only after a long struggle in which philosophical 
S played a large part. Developing side by side, the 
influencing the other, the philosophical and political 
vements passed through the same changes. In the 
enteenth century we find men’s interest chiefly cen- 
red about God. In the eighteenth century that interest 
is twofold: it concerns itself with nature, as well as with 
God. In the nineteenth century the interest has trans- 
ferred itself mainly to nature. The same transfer of 
thought takes place in politics. In the seventeenth 
century the interest centers in the king; in the eight- 
eenth century in both king and people; in the nine- 
teenth century the people fill the foreground. 
‘We may go back and express this great movement in 
«terms of metaphysics, and say that the conception of 
the absolute in America is, in the seventeenth century, 
monistic; in the eighteenth century, dualistic; in the 
nineteenth century, pantheistic. Under) Puritanism 
there is a belief in one, supreme, self-sufficient being, 
the sole ruler and disposer of all things. Under deism 
there is a belief in a deity whose powers and functions 
are limited by a law outside himself,—the law of nature, 
inviolable and immutable. Under transcendentalism, 
the deity, becoming immanent, is submerged in nature, 
 
-P-A-G-E-11
PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS 3 
ean scarcely be distinguished from the cosmic proc- 
esses. 
We have here three philosophical conceptions. It is 
not hard to show that they were influenced in their 
growth by the current theories of government. At the 
time of Puritanism there is a belief in absolute monarchy, 
when sovereignty is conceived to be given by God to 
the king, who thus rules by divine right. Then, at 
the time of deism there is a belief in limited monarchy, 
when sovereignty is conceived to be shared between 
ruler and subject, under a dual control. Finally, along 
with transcendentalism there arises a true conception 
of representative democracy, when sovereignty is con- ‘ 
ceived as vested in the people through the inalienable 
right of the law of nature. Between these two move- 
ments there is a striking parallel. In philosophy, the 
predominant interests are first: deity; then deity and 
nature; and lastly nature. In politics the kindred in- 
terests are: king, then king and people, and finally the 
people alone. That these sets of conceptions are really 
kindred is shown by the fact that one may be expressed 
in terms of the other. Under Puritanism the deity is 
represented as a dread monarch and sovereign ruler. 
This is the Calvinistic description of the immortal God. 
The same terms are used in reference to the temporal 
king. In the Articles of the Plymouth Church occurs 
the phrase: ‘‘ The King’s majesty we acknowledge for 
supreme governour,’’ while the subscribers to the May- 
flower compact sign themselves ‘‘ loyal subjects of our 
dread sovereign Lord King James.’’ 
These two conceptions sound so much alike because 
they are derived from common principles. Both English 
monarchy and New England theocracy are based upon 
the underlying tenet of transcendence and determinism. 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
4 PURITANISM 
  In religion this meant, briefly, that God was far off 
from his world and that he foreordained all its events. 
In politics, as Tom Paine bluntly expresses it in his 
Common Sense, this meant that the state of a king shuts 
him off from the world, yet the business of a king re- 
quires him to know it thoroughly. To carry out the 
parallel. The state advocates of divine right made the 
king high above his people and, at the same time, an auto- 
crat who decided the smallest affairs in the utmost bounds 
of his kingdom. The church advocates of divine sover- 
eignty were of the same temper and held that the Most 
High doth direct, dispose, and govern all creatures, 
actions, and things from the greatest even to the least. 
Here are two sets of belief similar in sense and leading 
to similar results. Yet neither king nor Calvin was to 
reign forever. A reaction followed which, in the case 
of the state, led to political revolt, and in the affairs 
of the church to a philosophical revolt. The former is 
a commonplace of history, the latter has not been made 
sufficiently prominent. The Puritan divinity was too 
much like the Stuart dynasty to be long acceptable 
to Anglo-American Independents. Special providences 
exerted in behalf of the elect bore too striking a resem- 
blance to his Majesty’s partiality to a favored few. 
And then, too, the doctrine of the sovereignty of God— 
absolute and unchallenged in will, power, and decree—led 
to the political equivalents coming under fire. Thus it 
was that William Livingston treated of the political 
correlatives and wrote picturesquely on ‘‘ Passive Obe- 
dience and Non-Resistance ’’: ‘‘ The tyrant used to club 
with the clergy and set them a-roaring for the divine 
rights of royal roguery. ’T'was a damnable sin to resist 
the cutting of throats and no virtue more Christian and 
refulgent than of a passive submission to butchery and
-P-A-G-E-13
  PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS 5 
slaughter. To propagate such fustian in America argues 
a disposition prone to senility. And yet ’tis not above 
four years ago, that in this very province I heard a 
dapper young gentleman, attired in his canonicals, con- 
tend as strenuously for non-resistance as if he had been 
animated with the very soul of Sacheverell.’’ 
Writing such as this marks the change from the Cal- 
vinistic or Puritan to the deistic or rational point of 
view. What has been said of this change in England 
holds true of the colonies. The theological conception 
of politics gave way before what may be termed the 
naturalistic. Instead of the constructive theory of the 
divine rights there was a transition to the theory of 
natural rights vested not only in the king but in the 
people. The latter, as propounded by Locke, was merely 
the former in disguise, for the doctrine of divine rights 
not only was transformed by imperceptible degrees into 
the theory of natural rights, but left behind it a legacy, 
in the sense that, because it is natural, government in 
general is divine. 
This process was destined to be carried further. 
Under the constant appeals to an absolute law and 
absolute right, there was a tendency to substitute lex 
for legislator, the principle for the person, and thus to 
run from the dualistic to the pantheistic stage. Conse- 
quently, that law of nature which under Puritanism was 
a subordinate source of authority, and under deism a 
co-ordinate, under transcendentalism became in itself 
an ultimate source of authority—a veritable absolute. 
Or, put in terms of political history: That sovereignty 
which first appertained to the king by divine right, 
and was then shared by the people by natural right, was 
at last lodged inalienably in the democracy. With this 
supersession of the vox dei by the vox populi, there
-P-A-G-E-14
  6 PURITANISM 
vesulted a curious analogy between the pantheism of 
Emerson and the doctrine of popular sovereignty. With 
the belief that the universe governs itself, is sufficient 
to itself and is itself its own end, came the declaration 
that the federal government is a government of the 
people, by the people, and for the people. 
2. Tue New Eneuanp Faruers 
  Puritanism in America enjoyed a metaphysical mo- 
nopoly for almost two centuries. From the landing of 
the Pilgrims to the appearance of Emerson the prevalent 
faith of the colonists and their descendants was Cal- 
vinism. This faith has been summed up in five points; 
it can be even more briefly put under two. These are 
transcendence and determinism, or the conception of a 
deity who lives apart from the world, and still guides 
and governs that world in the smallest details. This 
belief in ‘‘ one supreme self-sufficient Being, sole ruler 
‘and disposer of all ’’ obtained along the Atlantic coast 
for even more miles than it did years. It was adhered 
to by the Puritans in Massachusetts and Connecticut, 
by the Dutch Reformed in New York and New Jersey, 
by the orthodox German sects in Pennsylvania, and in 
the South, on the seaboard by the Huguenots, and in 
the mountains by the Scotch-Irish Presbyterians, the 
so-called Puritans of the South. 
Thus wide was the influence of Calvinism both as to 
duration of time and extent of space, for even the 
Church of England in America contained a large in- 
filtration of Genevan doctrine. 
With such a monopoly it is not surprising that Puri- 
tanism has been violently attacked, and that its history. 
has suffered at the hands of the expositor who delights
-P-A-G-E-15
  THE NEW ENGLAND FATHERS 7 
in presenting its sulphurous side. Thus a New England 
poem like the ‘‘ Day of Doom ”’ is taken as a fair example 
of the distressing illusions once inflicted upon them- 
selves in the name of religion by the best of men, and 
its author is declared to have attributed to the Divine 
Being the most execrable and loathsome character to 
be met with in any literature, Christian or pagan. This 
is said to be his narrow and ferocious creed: All men are 
totally depraved, all of them caught from the farthest 
eternity in the adamantine meshes of God’s decrees; 
the most of them also being doomed in advance by those 
decrees to an endless existence of ineffable torment, 
and the whole world, when the Judge of all the earth 
appears, to an universal conflagration. 
In this sketch too black a pencil has been used. If 
there is a dark side of Puritanism there is also a bright 
one. Later we shall examine the mystical portrait of 
Jonathan Edwards with its sweetness and light. But 
now we may look at Calvinism as if it were a larger 
canvas painted in the grand manner. As such it in- 
cluded the belief in the divine Sovereignty which left 
men free from care. To the elect no final ill could fall 
because they were cared for by a Spirit, ‘‘ infinite, 
eternal, and unchangeable.’’ Theirs was a sublime trust 
and theirs a sublime fatalism. But this was carried to 
extremes. As the historian of colonial literature has 
described it: the belief in a present, watchful, and 
benign Providence turned to abject superstition,—the 
belief in a microscopic and picayune providence con- 
cerning every falling tower, capsized sail-boat, or lost 
cow. It is almost incredible that the sublime and the 
ridiculous could be drawn from the same source. But 
such is the fact. The tone of Puritanism is a matter 
of interpretation. At the first there was about it the 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
8 PURITANISM 
lingering luster of the Elizabethan age; at the last it 
became mean and petty in the narrow routine of provin- 
cial life. 
We turn now to the American system of high Calvin- 
ism as it was expressed in official standards, like the 
Boston Platform of 1680, and in the utterances of its 
expositors from the Mathers to Jonathan Edwards. 
Calvinism as a system stands four-square. It may be 
‘viewed from the philosophic standpoints of ontology, 
/ the theory of being; of cosmology, the theory of the 
|world; of epistemology, the theory of knowledge ; and 
finally of psychology, the theory of personality. First, as 
a theory of being, Calvinism teaches that the deity lives 
outside the framework of the universe; that he interferes 
as he sees fit according to an absolute and arbitrary 
will; that he works through inscrutable decrees; that he 
foreordains whatever comes to pass. Second, as a theory 
of the cosmos, Calvinism teaches that the world is under 
the curse of the divine displeasure; that it conceals 
rather than displays its creator; that it is created from 
nothing and is destined to return to nothing; that the 
evil in it is a permissive act of God. Third, as a theory 
of knowing, Calvinism teaches that true knowledge comes 
more through revelation than through reason, being a 
gift of the divine pleasure rather than a result of human 
endeavor; that the decretive will of God is involved in 
deep mystery, whieh is for us little better than learned 
ignorance; that man has only a dim revelation of a 
hidden God communicated from without; that the 
human mind has no natural capacity for understanding 
the divine nature. Fourth, as a theory of personality, 
Calvinism teaches that God is alien in essence from 
man; that human progress comes through arbitrary 
grace, man being by nature corrupt; that our liberty is
-P-A-G-E-17
THE NEW ENGLAND FATHERS 9 
not self-determined, but works only within the limita- 
tions of our foreordained nature; that the last dictate 
of the understanding determines the will,—and yet, that 
within the will are included the inclinations. 
Such, in brief compass, was the system of official 
Calvinism. In its extreme form it obtained chiefly in 
New England, for like an Arctic current of thought, 
it grew slowly warmer and was gradually dissipated 
as it flowed south into the more genial regions of 
Anglican belief. We have now to consider some of 
the general causes which, in the course of time, have 
modified this frigid system. The first rival of Calvin- 
ism was Arminianism, which has been defined as an 
appeal to consciousness against a system of abstract 
logic. Calvinism had emphasized the God-ward side 
of theology and turned the divine government into an 
inexorable fate. Arminianism, on the contrary, em- 
phasized the man-ward side of theology and regarded 
human activity as a necessary condition of moral re- 
sponsibility. This contrast was rather in the way of 
professional theological rivalry; it remained for ordi- 
nary human nature to exhibit the full psychological 
revulsion: the head might believe in determinism and 
depravity, but the heart revolted against such dreadful 
doctrines. 
The second rival of Calvinism was deism,—the com- 
ing system of free-thought. This questioned the arbi- 
trary fiat of the Creator, and succeeded in bringing back 
liberty of human action. Between an absolute creator 
and an abject creation there was brought in a third 
factor, the law of nature in whose benefits man par- 
ticipated. However, in emphasizing the importance of 
that law, in making its bounds more and more exten- 
sive, deism tended to push the creator entirely away 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  10 PURITANISM 
from his world. Hence by the time the law of nature 
was made universal, the deity was brought to a far 
remove, and while counted the maker, was no longer 
considered the ruler of the universe. Here was the 
absentee landlord theory carried to extreme; for with 
this banishment of the master the servant grew boldly 
arrogant. Man, looking within himself, was becoming 
a law unto himself; hence that air of moral conceit and 
self-sufficiency assumed in increasing measure towards 
the end of the eighteenth century. 
We have anticipated and must therefore go back and 
study the more exact processes that brought about the 
disintegration of Calvinism. ‘First, there was a gradual 
degradation or lowering of the doctrine of transcen- 
dence, through the belief in miraculous intervention ; here 
the deity is brought into the world, not by immanence, 
but by interference, and general providence is turned 
into special providences. In place of the noble defini- 
tion of “thé living and true God, infinite in being and 
perfection, a most pure spirit, immutable, immense, 
eternal, incomprehensible,’’ there comes a conception of 
a being who manifests himself in ‘‘ remarkable sea- 
deliverances, remarkables about thunder and lightning, 
remarkable judgments upon Quakers, drunkards, and 
enemies of the church.’’? There followed also a gradual 
integration or hardening of the doctrine of determin- 
ism; the freedom of the will which was verbally allowed 
in the Westminster standards being practically denied 
by the later consistent Calvinists. Instead of the pro- 
vision whereby ‘‘ no violence is offered unto the will of 
the creature, nor is the liberty or contingency of second 
causes taken away,’’ there comes Samuel Willard’s 
avowal that there is in man a ‘‘ miserable impotency 
and malignity of will with respect to holy choices.’’  
-P-A-G-E-19
THE NEW ENGLAND FATHERS i 
Nevertheless there was a gradual elimination or soften- 
ing of the doctrine of the necessary depravity of human 
nature; here the new world being perforce a better 
world than the corrupt society Calvin had in view, men 
began somewhat egotistically to plume themselves on 
their virtues. Thus, in place of the ancient saying that 
‘* all noisome lusts abound in the soul like snakes in an 
old hedge,’’ we find Cotton Mather rejoicing that the 
Puritan by flying from the depravity of Europe to the 
American strand doth improve his manners“ Finally, 
there came a more lenient conception of the character 
of the Absolute. There was no longer a sovereign will 
at an immeasurable distance from man, but a more 
kindly leader, commander, and ruler of nature. In 
place of the outpourings of the divine fury, there comes 
the infiltration of the quality of mercy due to the essen- 
tial benevolence of the deity. 
In tracing the processes at work in the amelioration 
of Calvinism we notice that the positive factors were 
more_ powerful than-the negative, the best minds pre- 
ferring the progressive to the reactionary tenets. The 
process of elevation, in short, was stronger than degra- 
dation. It therefore came about that Calvinism found 
itself insensibly-drifting into ‘the deistic current,—away 
from the pessimisti¢ towards the optimistic, away from 
the misanthropic towards the philanthropic. How strong 
that current was may be seen fully only after we have 
explored the contributing streams. These.were.three : 
The political, which reached from a. state: supported 
chureh to perfect liberty of philosophizing; the he natu- 
ralistic, which reached from the supernatural to the 
scientific ; the rationalistic, which reached from revela-. 
tion to reason. These Hie streams or tendencies were 
represented by_ three men: olitical by Thomas Jef-

\ferson; the scientific by Benjamin Franklin; the ra- 
/tionalistic by Ethan Allen. 
8. Tue Revott Against Puritanism: EtHaN ALLEN 
Ethan Allen of Vermont has been previously known 
for his military exploits, but quite ignored for his 
speculative ventures. In the preface to his Oracles of 
Reason, 1784, the captor of Ticonderoga confesses that 
he has been denominated a deist; whether he is he does 
not know, but this he does know, that he is no Calvin- 
ist. In a pungent letter to one who inquired concern- 
ing his philosophy, he writes that he expects that the 
clergy, and their devotees, will proclaim war upon him 
in the name of the Lord, having put on the armor of 
faith, the sword of the Spirit, and the artillery of hell 
fire. ‘‘ But,’’ he concludes, ‘‘I am a hardy Moun- 
taineer and have been accustomed to the ravages and 
horrors of War and Captivity, and scorn to be intimi- 
dated by threats; if they fright me they must abso- 
lutely produce some of their tremendous fire, and give 
me a sensative scorching.’ 
For Allen’s roughness of manners and coarseness of 
speech Jared Sparks gives as mitigating circumstances 
the rude and uncultivated society in which the author 
lived. It might be added that the ‘‘ Green Mountain 
Boy ’’ was one of those backwoods thinkers who claim 
to be largely independent of outside ideas. Some rival 
asserted that he stole his title from Blount’s Oracles of 
Reason, but the author of this ‘‘ Compenduous System 
of Natural Religion ’’ throws no direct light on its 
sources. He maintained that the Bible and the diction- 
ary were his only authorities, but while he might have 
made a better use of both, it is hard to learn of what 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE REVOLT AGAINST PURITANISM 13 
other means of information he availed himself. He 
tells how in his youth, being educated in what were 
commonly called ‘‘ Armenian ”’ principles, he was much 
disposed to contemplation, and at his commencement 
in manhood, being in the habit of committing to manu- 
script such sentiments or arguments as appeared most, 
consonant to reason, he practiced this method of scrib- 
bling for many years. So claiming to have something 
of a smattering of philosophy, he recounts that while in 
an English prison-ship in 1775 and meeting two clergy- 
men,—‘‘ We discoursed on several parts of moral phi- 
losophy and Christianity, and they seemed to be sur- 
prised that I should be acquainted with such topics, or 
that I should understand a syllogism or regular mode 
of argumentation.’ 
Whatever the impulses that affected Ethan Allen, 
whatever the value of his claims as a self-made thinker, 
his work furnishes a good example of the popular recoil 
from Puritanism on the part of-one-who wished to pur-- 
sue the ‘‘ natural road of ratiocination.’’ This negative 
side of the Oracles is couched in a lively and aggressive 
style, for the writer is appealing to readers who despise 
the wearisome reasonings of philosophers and are pre- 
possessed with principles opposed to the religion of 
reason. In these parts of America, he explains, men are 
most generally taught that they are born into the world 
in a state of enmity to God and moral good and are 
under his wrath and curse; that the way to heaven and 
future blessedness is out of their power to pursue, and 
that it is encumbered with mysteries which none but the 
priests can unfold; that we must ‘‘ be born again,’’ have 
a special kind of faith, and be regenerated. 
Upon the priests and their so-called scheme of mys- 
teries, Allen now proceeds to make his onslaught. This 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  14 PURITANISM 
is the substance of his tirade: the spiritualists, who 
pretend to be as familiar with the supernatural world 
as with their own home-lot, talk as if the creator and 
governor of the universe had erected a particular acad- 
emy of arts and sciences in which they, the tutors, were 
alone intellectually qualified to carry on the business of 
teaching. With their special revelations they talk as 
if they only were rational creatures, and the rest of 
mankind a pack of clodhoppers, as ignorant as a stable 
of horses; but that is no revelation to me which is above 
my comprehension, or which from any natural sagacity 
I knew before. They may keep their alleged manuscript 
copy of God’s eternal law, it is sufficient for me to 
possess the deistical Bible, reason, by which I judge 
that even the commandments of the Decalogue would not 
be binding upon any rational being unless they coincided 
with the law of nature. 
Allen next proceeds to attack the Calvinistical system 
with all the homely wit of which he is master. Against 
the cardinal belief in magical interferences in the course 
of nature he argues that such intervention would turn 
nature into a supernatural whirligig, an inconstant and 
erring piece of mechanism; would reduce all nature to 
the level of fanaticism; would lead men to abandon the 
great discoveries of Newton for awful apprehensions 
of God’s providence, whereby world would crash upon 
world, or the tail of the next comet would set this world 
on fire. But such apprehensions are unwarranted and 
lead to a logical fallacy; either the great architect of 
nature has so constructed its machinery that it never 
needs to be altered, or, admitting miracles, we must 
admit this syllogism: the laws of nature have been al- 
tered, the alteration has been for the better, therefore, 
the eternal establishment thereof was imperfect. In
-P-A-G-E-23
  THE REVOLT AGAINST PURITANISM 15 
fine, to demonstrate such a scarecrow belief, one need 
but quote the anecdote attributed to his Most Christian 
Majesty, the King of France: ‘‘ By command of the 
King, God is forbidden to work any more miracles in 
this place.’’ 
These are fair examples of Allen’s anti-Calvinistic 
bias. Against other connected doctrines of the old 
systems he argues in a like short and easy manner, 
asserting, for example, that original sin had as little to 
do with the premised Adam as with the man in the 
moon; that the doctrine of imputation, or the transfer 
of the personal demerit of sin, is contradicted by the 
old proverb that every tub stands upon its own bottom; 
and that instead of insisting upon the gloomy doctrine 
of predestination, the teachers of this doctrine should 
spend their salaries in good wine to make the heart 
glad. 
With this vigorous but coarse attack upon the five 
points of Calvinism, there is little wonder that Allen’s 
miscalled theology should have been cordially detested 
by the orthodox, and that it should have been con- 
sidered an evidence of the workings of a watchful provi- 
dence that most of the edition was accidentally burned. 
Nevertheless the Vermont free-thinker had something 
else to do but startle the natives with his rustic wit. 
Besides the negative part of his work, in which he 
attempted to lop off the excrescences, there was the 
positive, in which he feels confident that he has struck 
the outlines of a consistent system. Briefly, in the 
place of the conception of a transcendent being, occa- 
sionally active in the affairs of the world, quite incom- 
prehensible within the mere limits of reason, he would 
substitute the conception of an immanent power, con- 
tinually active in the world, knowable in his nature from
-P-A-G-E-24
  16 PURITANISM 
a man’s own rational nature. Here, as the matter has 
been previously summarized, the origin of the concep- 
tion of a superintending power is traced to the sense 
of dependence on the laws of nature; from studies of 
those laws reason discovers the perfections of that 
power; order implies an orderer, harmony a regulator, 
motion a mover, and benefits goodness; chaos would 
prove a creator, but order and beneficent design are 
necessary to prove providence. 
Allen has now taken the first forward.step in his 
system, and that step is optimism. As he expressed the 
matter in a line obviously drawn from the Essay on 
Man: of all possible systems, infinite wisdom must have 
eternally discerned the best. This, it is explained, im- 
plies the essential benevolence of the deity and thereby 
we discover the prime requisite of moral perfection. 
But great difficulties arise in attempting to discover 
God’s natural attributes, especially his eternity and 
infinity: Because of these difficulties the writer is now 
forced to postulate two absolutes: God, the efficient 
cause, eternal and infinite, and nature the eternal and 
infinite effect; eternal here being defined as without 
end or duration, infinite as without degree or measure; 
hence, on the one side, is a cause uncaused and eternally 
self-existent who gave being and order to nature coeval 
with his own existence; on the other is nature coex- 
tensive and coexistent with the divine nature, eternal 
because of an eternal and immense fullness, infinite 
because infinitely complete and independent of any 
particular form. 
With two absolutes on his hands Allen is now in 
dire trouble. He sees the break between creator and 
creation and tries to mend it by expanding his previous 
notions of nature as being in a constant state of flux.
-P-A-G-E-25
  THE REVOLT AGAINST PURITANISM 17 
He explains that all forms are indebted to creation for 
their existence. The dissolution of forms animate or 
inanimate neither adds to nor diminishes from crea- 
tion; reduced to their original elements they are 
changed into new and diverse forms in never-ceasing 
rounds. The particles of matter which compose my 
body may have existed in more millions of different 
forms than I am able to enumerate, and be still liable 
to fluctuations equally numerous. This elementary 
fluxility of matter, which is mere creation, is as eternal 
as God, yet the particular productions, arising from 
natural causes, have a beginning and an end. 
With this reference to the ancient doctrine of nature 
as a plastic principle one may leave the Oracles of 
Reason. This work the elder President Dwight of Yale 
called the first formal publication in the United States 
openly directed against the Christian religion; Presi- 
dent Jared Sparks of Harvard described it as a crude 
and worthless performance, in which truth and error, 
reason and sophistry, know:edge and ignorance, in- 
genuity aba presumption are mingled together in a 
chaos which the author denominates a system. These 
academic strictures were perhaps deserved from the 
standpoint of the orthodox, yet the author received 
some praise, for as his friend George Washington said: 
“« There is an original something about Allen that com- 
mands attention.’’ 
The ‘‘ original something’’ which Allen contributed 
was this: a clear recognition of the difficulties of 
dualism, the old theological separation between God 
and the world. Allen suggested but did not effect a 
compromise. He spoke of the immense creation that 
we denominate by the name nature, and of its being 
necessarily coextensive and coexistent with the divine  
-P-A-G-E-26
18 PURITANISM 
nature. But how to identify creator and creation, how 
to make the two one, that final step he never took. — 
Nevertheless, in this very failure to identify the two 
conceptions, to make creator and creation the same One 
and All, permanent and infinite, the Vermont. philoso- 
pher did but leave a speculative task to be undertaken 
by a greater mind in a neighboring State, for it was 
Emerson who, struggling with the apparent dualism 
between God and nature, had the boldness to announce 
that the Absolute is one with the ordering and creative 
power of the universe.

  CHAPTER II 
EARLY IDEALISM 
1. Samuet Jounson: Discrete or BERKELEY 
In Samuel Johnson of Connecticut we meet a colonial 
idealist of an unusual type, not a mystic and recluse, 
but a publicist and traveler. After graduation at Yale Col- 
ege, Johnson voyaged across the Atlantic, met such nota- 
bles as Alexander Pope and the English Samuel John- 
son, and visited Oxford and Cambridge Universities, from 
which in due course he was to receive honorary degrees. 
Returning to the narrow bigotry of the British 
provinces, Johnson was not able to renew his larger 
interests until the visit of the Reverend George Berke- 
ley, the Irish idealist, who in 1729 took up his residence 
in Newport, Rhode Island. It was there that Johnson 
became a convert to the ‘‘ New Principle,’’ against 
which he had been warned in college, but which now 
seemed to him more apt than any other to be the true 
philosophical support of faith, to harmonize with our 
individual dependence on the Supreme Mind or Will, 
perpetually present and perpetually active. Moreover, 
the new system offered a satisfactory substitute for cer- 
tain old notions of matter. In place of the scholastic 
notion of an occult substance, and of the Cartesian‘ 
notion of a dead, inert somewhat, Berkeley substituted 
spiritual causality. In place of a phantom world lying 
behind the visible and tangible universe, and in place of 
masses of matter moved by mechanical forces he would 
19
-P-A-G-E-28
20 EARLY IDEALISM 
put as ‘‘ proper, active, efficient causes none but Spirit; 
nor any action, strictly speaking, but where there is 
Will.” 
Such is Berkeley’s explanation of the universal im- 
materialism in reply to a question of his ardent 
American disciple. The latter’s first letter contained 
some doubts as to the propriety of denying the absolute 
existence of matter, though he strove to understand how 
that meant nothing more than a denial of an incon- 
ceivable substratum of sensible phenomena. From 
Johnson’s letter of inquiry, which lay unpublished for 
over a century and three-quarters, we may now give 
these extracts: 
Reyv.d Sr. 
The Kind Invitation you gave me in Reading those ex- 
cellent Books which you was pleased to order into my Hands, 
is all the Apology I shall offer for the Trouble I now presume 
to give you: But nothing could encourage me to expose to 
your views my low and mean way of Thinking & writing, but 
my hopes of an Interest in that Candor and Tenderness which 
are so conspicuous both in your writings & Conversation. 
These Books, (for which I stand humbly obliged to you) 
contain Speculations the most surprisingly ingenious I have 
ever met with: & I must: confess that the Reading of them has 
almost convinced me, That Matter as it has been commonly 
defined for an unknown Quiddity is but a meer non-Entity. 
That it is a strong presumption against the Existence of it, that 
there never could be conceived any manner of connection be- 
tween it & our Ideas: That the esse of Things is only their 
percipi: & that the Rescuing us from the Absurdities of Ab- 
stract Ideas & the Gross Notion of Matter that have so much 
obtained, deserves well of the Learned World, in that it clears 
away very many difficulties & Perplexities in the Sciences. . . . 
That all the Phenomena of Nature must ultimately be re- 
ferred to the Will of the Infinite Spirit, is what must be al- 
lowed; But to suppose his immediate Energy in the production 
of every Effect, does not seem to impress so lively & great a 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
  SAMUEL JOHNSON: DISCIPLE OF BERKELEY 21 
Sense of his Power & wisdom upon our Minds, as to Suppose 
a Subordination of Causes & Effects among the Archtypes of 
our Ideas as he that should mak» a watch or clock of ever so 
beautiful an appearance & that should measure the Time ever 
so exactly, yet if he should be obliged to stand by it & influ- 
ence & direct all its motions, he would seem but very deficient 
in both his ability & skill, in comparison with him who should 
be able to make one that would regularly keep on its motion 
and measure the time for a considerable time, without the 
Intervention of any immediate force of its Author or any one 
else, impressed upon it. ... 
It is after all that has been said on that Head, Still some- 
thing shocking to many to think that there should be nothing 
but a meer show in all the art & contrivance appearing in the 
Structure, (for Instance) of a Human Body, particularly of 
the Organs of Sense: The Curious Structure of the Eye, what 
can it be more then meerly a fine show, if there be no con- 
nexion more than you Admit of, between that & vision? It 
Seems from the make of it to be designed for an Instrument 
or means of conveying the Images of External Things to the 
perceptive Faculty within; & if it be not so if it be really of 
no use in conveying visible objects to our minds, & if our 
visible Ideas are immediately created in them by the Will of 
the Almighty, why should it be mave to seem to be an Instru- 
ment or medium as much as if indeed it really were so? ... 
To these and similar queries Berkeley wrote a series 
, of letters, most of which are lost. But from those to 
be found in his published works we learn that the master 
went to great pains in forming the opinions of his 
pupil. How ably the latter expounded the doctrines 
of universal immaterialism and the divine visual lan- 
guage we shall seein the works of his maturity. .Mean- 
while’ Johnson had visited Berkeley at Whitehall, the 
latter’s country place near Newport, and within another 
year Berkeley had finished his Alctphron; or, the Minute 
Philosopher, which formed a most pleasing set of ideal- 
istic dialogues, wherein, from their many allusions and
-P-A-G-E-30
  22 EARLY IDEALISM 
touches of local color, Berkeley may be said to stand for 
Euphranor, the philosophic farmer, and Johnson for 
his friend Crito. So it was about this time that the 
neophyte expressed his conversion to the ideal theory, 
since, as he himself acknowledges, he found the Dean’s 
way of thinking and explaining things utterly precluded 
skepticism, and left no room for endless doubts and 
uncertainties. His denying matter at first seemed 
shocking ; but it was only for want of giving a thorough 
attention to his meaning. It was only the unintelligible 
scholastic notion of matter he disputed and not any- 
thing either sensible, imaginable, or intelligible; and 
it was attended with this vast advantage, that it not 
only gave new incontestable proofs of a deity, but 
moreover, the most striking apprehensions of his con- 
stant presence with us and inspection over us, and 
of our entire dependence upon him and infinite obli- 
gations to his most wise and almighty benevolence. 
On quitting the American strand, Berkeley has been 
most vividly described as leaving behind him a meta- 
physical double, another self, sharing his faith, speak- 
ing his language; viewing all things from the same 
angle; reasoning, discussing, concluding as he himself 
had done or would have done. In dedicating his prin- 
cipal work, from the deepest sense of gratitude, to 
George, Lord Bishop of Cloyne, Johnson admitted the 
truth of this description, for he confessed that he was 
in a particular manner beholden to that excellent phi- 
losopher for several thoughts that occur in the follow- 
ing tract. This was the Elementa Philosophica: Con- 
vtaining chiefly, Noetica, or Things Relating to the Mind 
or Understanding; and Ethica, or Things Relating to 
the Moral Behavior. 
From the Elements we may take two passages. The
-P-A-G-E-31
  
SAMUEL JOHNSON: DISCIPLE OF BERKELEY 23 
first of these, like the Irish idealism, emphasizes the 
vision of all things in God; the second, with a certain 
colonial independence, gives to the individual some_ 
share_in..the-acquirement, of knowledge: 
The notices which the mind has, derive originally from (or 
rather by means of) the two fountains of sense and conscious- 
ness. By means of the senses we receive simple ideas. These 
are sorted out into a vast variety of fixed combinations or 
compound ideas distinct from each other, in which the simple 
ideas are always found to co-exist; of these compound ideas 
consist every individual body in nature, such as we call horse, 
tree, &e. These various distinct combinations, connected to- 
gether in such a manner as to constitute one most beautiful 
and harmonious whole, make up what we call universal nature 
or the entire sensible or natural world. In the perception of 
these ideas or objects of sense we find our minds are merely 
passive, it not being in our power (supposing our organs 
rightly disposed and situated) whether we will see light and 
colours, hear sounds, &e. We are not causes to ourselves of 
these perceptions nor can they be produced in our minds with- 
out a cause, or (which is the same thing) by any imagined, un- 
intelligent, inert or inactive cause. / Hence they must be de- 
rived from an almighty, intelli t, active~cause,¢ exhibiting 
them_to US, impressing our minds with them, or produc- 
ing them in us.\ Consequently it must be by a perpetual 
intercourse of our minds with the deity, the great author of 
our beings, or by his perpetual influence or activity upon them, 
that they are possessed of all these objects of sense and the 
light by which we perceive them. {No sooner does any object 
strike the senses or is received in Our imagination, or appre- 
hended by our understanding, but we are immediately con- 
scious of a kind of intellectual light within us (if I may so 
call it), whereby we not only know that we perceive the object 
but directly apply ourselves to the consideration of it both in 
itself, its properties and powers and as it stands related to all 
other things, and we find that we are enabled by this intel- 
lectual light to perceive these objects and their relations in 
like manner as by sensible light we are enabled to perceive 
         
-P-A-G-E-32
24 EARLY IDEALISM 
  the objects of sense and their various situations; so our minds 
are passive in this intellectual light as they are sensible to 
light 2 ‘and can _no more withstand.the..evidence of it than they 
can withstand the ence..of sense... Thus I am ‘under the 
same necessity {0 assent to this—that I am or have a being and 
that I perceive and freely exert myself, as I am of assenting 
to this—that I see colours or hear sounds. I am perfectly 
sure that 2-+ 2=4, or that the whole is equal to all its parts 
as that I feel heat or cold, or that I see the sun. I am 
intuitively certain of both. This intellectual light I conceive 
of, as if it were a medium of knowledge just as sensible light 
is of sight. In both these is the power of perceiving and the 
object perceived; and this is the medium by which I am 
enabled to know it. This light is also one, and common to all 
intelligent beings, a Chinese or Japanese, as well as an Euro- 
pean or American. By it, all at once see things to be true or 
right, in all places at the same time, and alike invariably at 
all time, past, present and to come... . 
  Interesting as were Johnson’s philosophical writings 
they were not entirely original. There is, however, a 
chapter in the Elements which anticipated by many 
years the psychological study of the development of the 
child mind. At a time when another New England 
idealist could publicly assert that children were ‘‘ like 
little vipers,’? and almost an half-century before the 
first hints of the kindergarten had reached the country, 
Johnson gave this delightful presentation of the early 
stages of infancy: 
The first notices of the mind are doubtless those of sense, 
but directly joined with a consciousness of its perception. 
Warmth and hunger, and probably some pains, are, perhaps, 
all the sensations the infant hath before its birth; and when 
it comes into the light of this world, it is directly impressed 
with the sense of light and colours, as well as sounds, tastes, 
odours, and frequent uneasy and painful sensations, all of 
which still more and more awaken its consciousness; and
-P-A-G-E-33
  SAMUEL JOHNSON: DISCIPLE OF BERKELEY 25 
every fresh notice of sense and consciousness still goes on to 
excite its admiration and engage its attention. And being a 
perfect stranger to everything about it, it hath everything 
to learn; to which it diligently | ap lies itself, as its conscious: 
ness more aid more awakens upon the repetition every mo-) 
ment, of fresh impressions of sense, until by degrees, having 
\a-preat™ number of feelings, tastes, odours, sounds and visible 
objects, frequently repeating their several impressions, its 
conscious memory still enlarging, it begins, by means of the 
intellectual light with which it finds its consciousness attended, 
gradually to collect and recollect the several relations and 
connections it observes to obtain among its various ideas. And 
at length, when it is in ease, it discovereth a wonderful curi- 
osity and delight in observing these connections, as well as 
being impressed with new ideas. Now it hath been made very 
evident, both by reasoning and experiment, that, as Bishop 
Berkeley shows in his Theory of Vision, the objects of sight 
and touch are entirely different and distinct things, and that 
there is no necessary connection between them. It must, there- 
fore, be a matter of great exercise of thought in an infant 
mind to learn this connection, and particularly, to learn the 
notion of the various distances and situations of things tan- 
gible, by its observations on the various degrees of strength 
and weakness, of vividness or faintness of the light reflected 
from them, in the things visible constantly connected with 
them. And at the same time that it hath these things to learn, 
which must be a laborious work, as being the same thing with 
learning a language, it is also learning the names of things, 
and the connection and use of words, which is another lan- 
guage. And, as if all these were not task enough, it hath all 
this while to be learning how to use its limbs, its hand in 
handling, its tongue, and other organs of speech, in making 
and imitating sounds, and its whole body in all its exertions, 
and particularly, at length, the poise of its centre of gravity 
and the use of its feet in walking. All these things require a 
great deal of application, and the exercise of much thought 
and exertion. So that it seems evident that these little crea- 
tures from the beginning, do consider, reflect and think a 
prodigious deal more than we are commonly apt to imagine. 
The reason why so many little, low, weak and childish   
-P-A-G-E-34
  26 EARLY IDEALISM 
things appear in them, which we are apt to despise and think 
beneath our notice, is not for want of good sense and capacity, 
but merely for want of experience and opportunity for in- 
tellectual improvement. Hence also it appears that we ought 
to think little children to be persons of much more importance 
than we usually apprehend them to be; and how indulgent 
we should be to their inquisitive curiosity, as being strangers; 
with how much candour, patience and care we ought to bear 
with them and instruct them; with how much decency, honour 
and integrity we ought to treat them; and how careful it con- 
cerns us to be, not to say or do anything to them or before 
them that savours of falsehood and deceit, or that is in any 
kind indecent or vicious. Pueris maxima debetur reverentia 
is a good trite old saying. 
This remarkable sketch of the progress of the mind 
concludes the Noetica. This, together with the Ethica, 
made up the Elementa Philosophica, which was used in 
both King’s College during Johnson’s presidency and 
also in the philosophy school of the Academy of Phila- 
delphia. And yet the use of this idealistic text-book 
was without palpable effect upon either institution, and 
that because of an unfavorable environment; in the one 
case there was such a spirit of commercialism as to 
stifle mere speculation, in the other such a tendency 
towards materialism that, as Franklin wrote to John- 
son,—‘‘ Those parts of the Elements of Philosophy that 
savor of what is called Berkeleism are not well under- 
stood here.’’ 
But while Johnson was much disappointed that his 
work was not more generally appreciated, he received 
some crumbs of comfort. Benjamin Franklin gener- 
ously assumed the expense of printing the American 
edition of the Elements; William Smith, provost of the 
College of Philadelphia, wrote a laudatory introduc- 
tion to the London edition, and Cadwallader Colden,
-P-A-G-E-35
SAMUEL JOHNSON: DISCIPLE OF BERKELEY 27 
  lieutenant-governor of New York, was so stimulated by 
the perusal of the latter, that he renewed his amicable 
controversy with Johnson regarding the material uni- 
verse as a dynamic whole. Although there were these 
gratifying results for the Connecticut idealist in Penn- 
sylvania and New York, in other provinces there was a 
different condition of affairs. During Berkeley’s so- 
journ in Rhode Island, Edwards was living in Massa- 
chusetts, yet here there were no sure signs of the 
Irish idealism to be found. Even the college at Cam- 
bridge was so satisfied with its own speculations, so 
wrapped up in its peculiar ecclesiasticism, that it paid 
no attention to the distinguished foreign visitor of 
another faith. The same result obtained in New Jersey, 
but for somewhat different causes. Harvard was ration- 
alistic to a degree, but Princeton was so imbued with 
the common sense philosophy that the Berkeleian ideal- 
ism, which had somehow stolen into that abode of 
orthodoxy, was denominated a mere philosophical day- 
dream. 
Besides these special causes there were general causes 
for the American indifference to Berkeleism. It has 
been declared the fault of circumstances that Johnson’s 
book fell on a time when the New World was engaged 
in conquests in the material rather than in the spiritual 
sphere. A Gallic critic finds this a polite but shrewd 
way of saying that Anglo-Americans of the late eight- 
eenth century were unfit to receive or to develop a true 
idealism, for what was true in the British colonies was 
also true in the mother country. The indifference with 
which Johnson’s work was received in England was 
owing to its appearance at a moment the most in- 
opportune; the spiritualistic philosophy was then losing 
ground, a crass sensualism or a radical skepticism was
-P-A-G-E-36
  28 EARLY IDEALISM 
taking its place. If Johnson could have presented his 
immaterialism to an entirely new age, he might™have- 
arrested general attention. The most that can now 
be said of his endeavors was that he was the meta- 
physical double, the ideal image of the good Bishop of 
Cloyne, but withal unsuccessful in spreading, to any 
great extent, that form of idealism for which the latter 
stood. 
2. JonaTHAN Epwarps, Mystic 
Tradition has marked Jonathan Edwards as the 
greatest of our Puritan divines, the relentless logician 
who left the print of his iron heel upon the New Eng- 
land conscience. It is true that Edwards delivered the 
dreadful Enfield sermon ‘‘ Sinners in the Hands of an 
Angry God,’’ and that he composed that rigid treatise, 
concerning the Freedom of the Will, which belied its 
title and doomed the bulk of mankind to the workings 
of an inexorable fate. But this is only one side of the 
picture. In public Edwards was the pitiless profes- 
sional theologian. In private he was poet, mystic, phi-, 
losopher of the feelings. As a boy he reached the , 
thought that ‘‘ this world exists nowhere but in they 
mind.’’ As a young man he used frequently to ‘‘ retire 
into a solitary place on the banks of the Hudson’s River 
for contemplation on divine things.’’ In maturity he ) 
wrote his treatise concerning Religious Affections in/ 
which he described the true believers’ soul as receiving / 
light from the sun of righteousness in such a manner | 
that their nature is changed, that they become little \ 
suns partaking of the nature of the fountain of her } 
light. 
This inward and intimate side of the ‘‘ saint of New 
England ’’ is that which makes him pre-eminently a «c
-P-A-G-E-37
  JONATHAN EDWARDS, MYSTIC 29 
mystic é and seeker after the interior or hidden life, At 
a very early age he built himselfa hut in a swamp. 
There he communed with his.God, became enamored 
of nature, and reached the conclusion that the “one was 
but the-expression of the other. As he put it in one of 
his later writings: ‘‘We have shown that the Son of 
God created the world for this very end—to communi- 
cate Himself an image of His own excellency.... 
When we behold the light and brightness of the sun, 
the golden edges of an evening cloud, or the beauteous 
bow, we behold the adumbrations of His glory and good- 
ness; and in the blue sky, of His mildness and gentle- 
ness. There are also many things wherein we may 
behold His awful majesty: in the sun in his strength, 
in comets, in thunder, with the lowering thunder-clouds, 
in ragged rocks and the brows of mountains.’’ 
We are then to count Edwards a mystic because of 
his wonderful sense of the immediateness of the divine 
presence and agency. But in addition to his youthful 
ecstasy he had a philosophical basis for his convictions. 
Shortly after entering Yale College at the age of twelve, 
he wrote a little essay which had this as its corollary,— 
‘it follows from hence that those beings which have 
knowledge and Consciousness are the Only Proper and 
Real And substantial beings, inasmuch as the being of 
other things is Only by these. from hence we may see 
the Gross mistake of those who think material things 
the most substantial beings and spirits more like a 
shadow, whereas spirits Only Are Properly Substance.’’ 
This is the famous undergraduate paper entitled Of 
Being, which has been declared as precocious as the 
Thoughts of Paseal and also remarkable as the counter- 
part of Berkeley’s theory of the divine visual language. 
As to its originality there are many reasons for thinking 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
30 EARLY IDEALISM 
  that the young Puritan did not borrow from the Church 
of England divine. There is the negative reason that 
the given corollary follows from a supposition to the 
contrary. . . . Let us suppose for illustration this im- 
possibility that all the Spirits in the Universe to be for 
a time to be Deprived of their Consciousness, and Gods 
Consciousness at the same time to be intermitted. I 
say the Universe for that time would cease to be of it self 
and not only as we speak because the almighty Could 
not attend to Uphold the world but because God knew 
nothing of it... . 
There is also the positive reason that Edwards gives 
a definition of the divine language of signs which has 
been declared truly marvelous as emanating from a 
mere boy. . . . Indeed, reasons Edwards, the secret lies 
here: That, which truly is the Substance of all bodies, 
is the infinitely exact, and precise, and perfectly stable 
Idea, in God’s mind, together with His stable Will, that 
the same shall gradually be communicated to us, and 
to other minds, according to certain fixed and exact 
established Methods and Laws; or in somewhat different 
language, the infinitely exact and precise Divine Idea, 
together with an answerable, perfectly exact, precise, 
and stable Will, with respect to correspondent com- 
munications to Created Minds, and effects on their 
minds. 
'The logical side of Edwards’s mind is not that which 
we would dwell on. It is the poetical and the mystical 
which give a truer insight into his nature. The first hint 
of his quietistic experience is given in the phrase that 
“* nothing ’’ is ‘‘ the same that the sleeping rocks dream 
of.’? The next is in his definition of inspiration as 
an absolute sense of certainty, a knowledge in a sense 
intuitive, wherein such bright ideas are raised, and such
-P-A-G-E-39
  
JONATHAN EDWARDS, MYSTIC 31 
a clear view of a perfect agreement with the excellencies 
of the Divine Nature, that it is known to be a communi- 
cation from Him; all the Deity appears in the thing, and 
in everything pertaining to it. 
Edwards is convinced of the verity of mystical intui- 
tion. At the same time he is wise enough to state that 
while this may be immediate, it does not come all at 
once nor arise without painful preparation. There are 
three stages in the process: first, comes by great and 
violent inward struggles the gaining of a spirit to part 
with all things in the world; then, a kind of vision or 
certain fixed ideas and images of being alone in the 
mountains or some solitary wilderness far from all 
mankind; finally, a thought of being wrapt up in God 
in heaven, being, as it were, swallowed up in Him for- 
ever. In these few words Edwards has summed up the 
mystic progression presented in the ancient manuals, 
those three stages in the ladder of perfection,—first, 
the purgative, brought about by contrition and amend- 
ment; then, the illuminative, produced by concentration 
of all the faculties upon God; lastly, the intuitive 
or unitive, wherein man beholds God face to face and is 
joined to Him in perfect union. In a passage of ex- 
quisite beauty, which may well be called a classic of 
the inner life, the saint of New England thus proceeds 
to unfold the record of his youthful ecstasy :— 
After this my sense of divine things gradually increased, 
and became more and more lively, and had more of that inward 
sweetness. The appearance of everything was altered; there 
seemed to be, as it were, a calm, sweet cast, or appearance of 
divine glory, in almost everything. God’s excellency, his wis- 
dom, his purity and love, seemed to appear in every thing; in 
the sun, moon, and stars; in the clouds, and the blue sky; in 
the grass, flowers, trees; in the water, and all nature; which 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  32 EARLY IDEALISM 
used greatly to fix my mind. I often used to sit and view the 
moon for continuance; and in the day, spent much time view- 
ing the clouds and sky, to behold the sweet glory of God in 
these things: in the mean time, singing forth, with a low voice, 
my contemplations of the Creator and Redeemer. And scarce 
any thing, among all the works of nature was so sweet to me 
as thunder and lightning; formerly, nothing had been so terrible 
to me. Before, I used to be uncommonly terrified with thunder 
and to be struck with terror when I saw a thunder-storm 
rising; but now, on the contrary, it rejoiced me. I felt God, 
so to speak, at the first appearance of a thunder-storm; and 
used to take the opportunity, at such times, to fix myself in 
order to view the clouds, and see the lightnings play, and hear 
the majestic and awful voice of God’s thunder which often- 
times was exceedingly entertaining, leading me to sweet con- 
templations of my sweet and glorious God. While thus 
engaged, it always seemed natural to me to sing, or chant forth 
my meditations; or, to speak my thoughts in soliloquies with a 
singing voice. Holiness, as I then wrote down some of my con- 
templations on it, appeared to me to be of a sweet, pleasant, 
charming, serene calm nature; which brought an inexpressible 
purity, brightness, peacefulness, and ravishment to the soul. 
In other words, that it made the soul like a field or garden of 
God, with all manner of pleasant flowers; all pleasant, de- 
lightful, and undisturbed; enjoying a sweet calm, and the 
gently vivifying beams of the sun. The soul of a true Chris- 
tian, as I then wrote my meditations, appeared like such a 
little white flower as we see in the spring of the year; low, 
and humble on the ground, opening its bosom, to receive the 
pleasant beams of the sun’s glory; rejoicing, as it were, in a 
calm rapture; diffusing around a sweet fragrancy; standing 
peacefully and lovingly, in the midst of other flowers round 
about; all in like manner opening their bosoms, to drink in 
the light of the sun. There was no part of creature-holiness, 
that I had so great a sense of its loveliness as humility, broken- 
ness of heart, and poverty of spirit; and there was nothing 
that I so earnestly longed for. My heart panted after this,— 
to lie low before God, as in the dust; that I might be nothing; 
and that God might be ALL.

  JONATHAN EDWARDS, MYSTIC 33 
In the concluding passage of this exquisite rhap- 
sody there appear what have been called the un- 
mistakable marks of the mystic in every age,—the 
desire to be united with the divine, the longing to be 
absorbed into the inmost essence of the Absolute. But in 
Edwards’s full narrative there are also to be found the 
marks of mysticism from the modern point of view. Let 
us now submit the matter to the test of the psychology 
of religion. William James has given the proper marks 
of mysticism as four in number: Ineffability—the sub- 
ject of it immediately says that it defies expression, that 
no adequate report of its contents can be given in words, 
—in this peculiarity mental states are more like states 
of feeling than like states of intellect. The noetic qual- 
ity,—although so similar to states of feeling, mystical 
states seem to those who experience them to be states of 
knowledge; they are states of insight, illuminations, 
revelations, full of significance and importance, all in- 
articulate though they remain. Transiency,—mystical 
states cannot be sustained for long, their quality can 
be but imperfectly reproduced in memory, yet this is 
susceptible of continuous development in what is felt as 
inner richness and importance. Passivity,—the oncom- 
ing of mystical states can be facilitated by preliminary 
voluntary operations, yet when the characteristic sort 
of consciousness has once set in, the mystic feels as if 
his own will were in abeyance. 
We may apply these tests to the records of Edwards’s 
inner life in order to gain a further insight into his 
mental processes. The mark of transiency may be neg- 
lected. The brief duration, the constant intermittence, 
is an accident, not an essential of the mystic state. Ed- 
wards complained that his earlier affections were lively 
and easily moved, and that it was only after he had spent
-P-A-G-E-42
34 EARLY IDEALISM 
  most of his time, year after year, in meditation and 
soliloquy that his sense of divine things seemed gradually 
to increase. Leaving aside, then, the mark of transiency, 
one reaches the more important mark of passivity. Here 
Edwards says in his early notes on the Mind: Our 
perceptions or ideas that we passively receive through 
our bodies are communicated to us immediately by 
God. There never can be any idea, thought, or action 
of the mind unless the mind first received some ideas 
from sensation, or some other way equivalent, wherein 
the mind is wholly passive in receiving them. 
We should note, in passing, that there is here given 
a clew to Edwards’s precocious idealism. The passive 
or quietistie state readily lends itself to a sense of the 
unreality of the external world. In Edwards’s lan- 
guage this takes the form of a belief that corporeal 
things could exist no otherwise than mentally, and that 
other bodies have no existence of their own. In modern 
psychological terms the recognition of the unreal sense 
of things may be laid to a temporary absence of con- 
zsthesia, a transient loss of the sense of the compact 
reality of the bodily organism. Furthermore, this in- 
direct phenomenalism, this extreme subjectivism, being 
earried to its logical extreme, might well lead to the 
conclusion embodied in Edwards’s first fragment, the 
corollary of the essay on Being, which protested 
against the view that material things are the most 
substantial, and affirmed that spirits only are properly 
substances. 
Vivid, intense, personal impressions furnish in largest 
measure the substance of Edwards’s idealism. But that 
idealism was only suppplementary, only an afterthought 
to his mysticism. We return therefore to that most 
positive mark of mysticism—the noetic quality. In his
-P-A-G-E-43
  JONATHAN EDWARDS, MYSTIC 35 
maturer essays on the Spiritual Light and the Religious 
Affections Edwards attempts to express the manner and 
means of his conviction of that ‘‘ new sense of things ”’ 
quite different from anything he ever expressed before. 
As a sign of the thoroughness of his thinking he takes 
pains to present the negative side. What is this divine 
and supernatural light immediately imparted to the 
soul by the Spirit of God? . . . It does not consist in 
any impression made upon the imagination, as when one 
may be entertained by a romantic description of the 
pleasantness of fairy-land, or be affected by what one 
reads in a romance, or sees acted in a stage-play. No, 
rather as he that beholds objects on the face of the 
earth, when the light of the sun is cast upon them, is 
under greater advantage to discern them in their true 
forms and natural relations, than he that sees them in 
a dim twilight, so God, in letting light into the soul, 
deals with man according to his nature and makes use 
of his rational faculties. 
So far as Edwards was concerned, the objects of the 
mystical knowledge were as substantial realities as his 
Berkshire mountains, yet he felt obliged to bring home 
to others the proper rationality of that knowledge. 
Then, too, the treatise on the Religious Affections being 
called forth by the revival which had meanwhile swept 
over his parish, the Puritan divine was in a further diffi- 
cult position, for he stood midway between the skeptics 
of his age and those persons who were of abnormal 
emotional sensibility. On the one side, he explains, are. 
many in these days who condemn the affections which 
are excited in a way that seems not to be the natural 
consequence of the faculties and principles of human 
nature; on the other side are those of a weak and 
vapory habit of body and of brain easily susceptive of
-P-A-G-E-44
  36 EARLY IDEALISM 
impressions; as a person asleep has dreams of a he 
is not the voluntary author, so may such persons, in 
like manner, be the subjects of involuntary impressions, 
when they are awake. But the true saint belongs to 
neither of these. In him the divine spirit may co- 
operate in a silent, secret, and undiscernible way, with 
the use of means, and his own endeavors, and yet that 
is not all. Spiritual light may be let into the soul in 
one way, when it is not in another; in a dead carnal 
frame, it is as impossible that it should be kept alive in 
its clearness and strength as it is to keep the light in 
the room when the candle that gives it is put out, or 
to maintain the bright sunshine in the air when the 
sun is gone down. 
By this final figure of speech Edwards has expressed 
more than the inadequacy of reason to explain the 
mystery of the inner life. The figure is itself a reason 
which explains why Puritan mysticism failed to spread 
in the land. Edwards himself was the chief luminary in 
that system, and with his eclipse came irreparable loss. 
He was not only the chief of New England divines, but 
the chief native exponent of the scholastic of the heart, 
the dialectic of the feelings. But those teachings of 
his had now a lessening audience. In the mid-year of the 
century he was forced by an unhappy estrangement 
from his pastorship at Northampton and driven from 
the haunts of scholarship to the edge of the Western 
wilderness and into actual peril from the inroads of 
the savages. And so his arduous missionary labors 
among the Indians at Stockbridge had much to do in 
preventing the elaboration of his mystical doctrine.

  MYSTICISM 37 
3. Mysticism: From QUAKERISM TO CHRISTIAN SCIENCE 
The spreading of Edwards’s mystical beliefs was 
thwarted by local conditions. But there were other 
and more general causes at work to prevent the ac- 
ceptance of such tenets. For one thing, orthodox 
Puritanism was opposed to the belief in a ‘‘ divine and 
supernatural light immediately imparted to the soul.’’ 
As Increase Mather declared: Here on earth we have 
but a dark and very imperfect knowledge of God; only 
in heaven do the glorified saints have the beatific vision. 
The reason for this restriction is not hard to find. The 
notion of self-illumination was abhorrent to those be- 
lievers in historic revelations and oracles, who consid- 
ered that they already possessed sufficient sources of 
inspiration in the Bible, the church, and reason. Of 
these three the first was counted chiefest. ‘‘ The word 
of God as contained in the Scriptures ’’ was the final 
record of the divine message to men. So, as Edward 
Channing has said in the ease of Mistress Anne Hutch- 
inson, the conception that any man—much less any 
woman—should pretend to be inspired by the Almighty 
was not to be held for one instant. 
Orthodox Puritanism was therefore out of all sym- 
pathy with mysticism. Only contempt met the ‘‘ famil- 
ist,’? who depended upon rare revelations and forsook 
the revealed word. This explains not only the neglect 
of Edwards as mystic, but the Puritan persecution of 
the Quakers in Massachusetts, and Puritan hatred of 
the colony of Rhode Island, where all quietistic brethren 
were welcome. This colony was to its neighbors ‘‘ the 
drain or sink of opinionists.’? To Friends it was a 
“true port and quiet habitat.’? Nevertheless Roger 
Williams and his adherents were enabled to make but 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  38 EARLY IDEALISM 
little impression on the times, for the reason that New 
England was too narrow in its views. So it remained 
for the broader acres to the South to take in those who 
cared for the contemplative life. Foremost of these 
were William Penn and the Pennsylvania Quakers. The 
latter term, as is well known, is derisive not descriptive. 
Not Quakers, but Friends is the proper designation. As 
one of their own number has said: ‘‘ There is a principle 
which is pure, placed in the human mind, which in 
different places and ages has had different names; it is, 
however, pure and proceeds from God. It is deep and 
inward, confined to no forms of religion, nor excluded 
from any, when the heart stands in perfect sincerity. 
In whomsoever this takes root and grows they become 
brethren.’’ 
This is the statement of John Woolman, the humble 
tailor of New Jersey. It may be supplemented by that 
of the royal proprietary of Pennsylvania. William 
Penn had sent to his friends a Key opening the Way 
to every Capacity. The key is to be found in personal 
illumination; not the light of mere reason, but some- 
thing higher. This light, it is explained, is some- 
thing else than the bare understanding man hath as a 
rational creature; since, as such, man cannot be a light 
to himself... . For we can no more be a mental or 
intellectual light to ourselves, than we are an external 
corporeal light to ourselves. What Penn expressed 
negatively another of the primitive Friends expressed 
positively: That which God hath given us the experi- 
ence of, is the mystery, the hidden life, the inward 
spiritual appearance of our Lord. 
We have reached the second stage in the search for 
the sources of mystic illumination. As to divine truth, 
the Puritans had taught that the Bible gives, the church
-P-A-G-E-47
  MYSTICISM 39 
expounds, the reason accepts. The Quakers now pro- 
ceed to drop the second channel of communication. To 
them there is no need of other men as intermediaries, 
since it is Christ’s light communicated to the soul that 
makes manifest the things that belong to the soul’s 
peace. Such a sentiment as this makes a priesthood 
and even a ministry unnecessary. In their stead, then, 
arise the Friends’ meeting-houses,—places for ‘‘ silence 
and heavenly frames.’’ Here the congregation awaits 
the moving of the Spirit, since it is held that resigna- 
tion and quietness are the safest way to attain the clear 
discerning of the motions of truth. 
The process of elimination did not stop even here. 
While the orthodox Friends appealed both to the Bible 
and reason, the unorthodox or Hicksite Friends ap- 
pealed to reason, so far as possible unfettered by Scrip- 
ture. They argued that if reason alone is competent 
to reach divine truth, revelation is superfluous. Thus 
Elias Hicks took the traditional Quaker inspiration for 
the union of self with a larger whole and tried to turn 
the feeling regarding ‘‘ the universal divine principle ’’ 
into a conclusion concerning the ‘‘ fullness of God in us 
and in every blade of grass.’’? An opponent called this 
a wandering off into the dreary wastes of pantheism. 
We dissent from the description except in so far as there 
was a real tendency towards a philosophical monism. 
At this point we have apparently reached the conclu- 
sion of the whole matter. All three channels of mystical 
communication seem exhausted, yet the process of elimi- 
nation was carried even further. That inward fellow- 
ship, received immediately from the divine fountain, 
was now sought by a group of mystics who cared less 
for the Bible, the church, and reason, than for reason 
transcended. It was the so-called Pennsylvania Pietists,  
-P-A-G-E-48
  40 EARLY IDEALISM | 
orld who sought by direct intuition to get at ‘‘ the 
behind this world.’’ Their quest was for ‘‘ the real 
above all reason, beyond all thought.’? Such was the 
actual aim of Conrad Beissel, head of the monastic com- 
munity at Ephrata near Philadelphia. Unfortunately 
these speculations in the ‘‘ camp of the solitary ’’ were 
hidden behind a veil of theosophic lore,—the esoteric 
doctrine of the Sophia or principle of wisdom. Penn- 
sylvania Pietists, like the European brotherhood of 
which they were a branch, sought to be tasters of su- 
preme experience, but their quest of the truly transcen- 
dental, of knowledge above knowledge, was only laughed 
at by their neighbors and contemporaries. As a writer 
of the day expressed it: ‘‘ Cabbalists and Quietists all 
affect a mystical language, a dark kind of canting; 
they talk much of a light within them, instead of com- 
mon sense,—whoever shall reconcile all these must be 
an Cidipus indeed.’’ 
Because of this essentially Anglo-Saxon way of re- 
garding mysticism and nonsense as convertible terms, it 
is not surprising that early mysticism in America rap- 
idly evaporated. One reason for its comparative failure 
has already been given: It opposed the standards set by 
church and by Scripture. But there were other reasons. 
Beside being unorthodox, it was inarticulate or without 
a vehicle of self-expression: There was, of course, Ed- 
wards’s quietistic tractate on the Affections, but that 
was counteracted by the excesses of the religious re- 
vivals. Outside of this there was no native book which 
could serve as a mystic manual. John Woolman’s 
Journal was only rescued from oblivion by the Quaker 
poet Whittier. William Penn’s No Cross, No Crown, 
written in the Tower of London, went through several 
American editions, but it was too didactic to attract wide
-P-A-G-E-49
    
MYSTICISM 41 
attention. ‘‘ Think not thine own thoughts,’’ ‘‘ Wait 
to feel something divine,’’—directions such as these 
lacked the poetic and imaginative touch necessary to 
mystie enthusiasm. So without living native sources 
the stream ran dry. Recourse was had to foreign parts. 
During the century of Quaker Quictism translations of 
Fénelon and even of Juan de Valdés were circulated 
among American Friends, but the imagery of France 
and of Spain was hardly in keeping with that of the New 
World. 
Besides being inarticulate, native mysticism was in- 
opportune. At the end of its century Quakerism should 
have borne the fruit of literary:expression. But cir- 
cumstances were against that fruition. The Revolu- 
tionary War arose and the results to mystical men of 
peace were disastrous, militarism being by nature op- 
posed to mysticism; pomp, and outward show to the 
quiet concentration of all the inner forces of the soul 
upon supernatural objects. And this quest of a world 
beyond this world was hindered by another circum- 
stance,—the cessation of immigration from the home 
country. For the Society of Friends this meant that 
there was no one to take the place of such men as 
Robert Barclay, and for the Pennsylvania Pietists of 
such men as Conrad Beissel. While both English and 
German suffered from the lack of fresh blood, new rivals 
arose in the coming of the Scotch-Irish. In place of the 
men of feeling and sentiment came the men of cold 
intellect and plain common sense. With Philadelphia as 
their chief point of entry these dogmatists spread over 
the very regions, West and South, into which pietists 
and Quakers had made their timid advances. This 
matter is one of the psychology of race and the survival 
of the fittest. As regards number and influence the 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
42 EARLY IDEALISM 
  soft-hearted were supplanted by the hard-headed. And 
the latter were also helped by their spiritual kin, the 
deists. It was a characteristic of the rationalist to look 
at ‘‘ enthusiasts ’’ with a coldly critical eye. The fol- 
lowers of Penn were not openly derided because their 
commercial standing was secure and their social posi- 
tion assured. But the followers of Jacob Boehme were 
ealled fantastic, and Franklin, who printed some of the 
““ Dutch ’’ books, had only contempt for those Quietists 
who removed hither from Germany. 
We must now attempt to estimate the value and 
results of early American mysticism. It was unortho- 
dox, it was inarticulate, it was inopportune. Was it 
ineffective? There are some who hold that mysticism 
is by nature passive and theoretical, not active and 
practical. They claim that the mystical life is a life of 
contemplation, not of ethical energy ; that the individual, 
being lost in the excess of divine light, loses -his sense 
of personality. To such critics we offer these facts: 
William Penn’s treaty with the Indians, John Wool- 
man’s protest against slavery, and the continued agita- 
tion of the Society of Friends against militarism, from 
the time of the Revolution to this year’s Mohonk Con- 
ference. To those who would scornfully say that mys- 
ticism is by nature theoretical and never practical, we 
point not only to this list of emancipators, abolitionists, 
pacificists, but to the causes which underlay their ac- 
tivities. That cause has been suggested by Whittier. 
It was that they were men who sincerely applied their 
minds to true virtue and found an inward support from 
above. Nevertheless a compromise must be made be- 
tween critic and defender. Our early American mys- 
ticism was in a sense ineffective. Privately the practice 
of quietism engendered a state of tender sensibility and 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
MYSTICISM 43 
  an appreciation of the higher morality. But publicly 
the movement did not spread because it was not a truly 
social movement. Quietists were in one sense separatists. 
Beside their matrimonial segregation they had their own 
meeting-houses and brotherhoods, and communities like 
that started by Count Zinzendorf, near Sharon, Con- 
necticut. Such segregation put them out of joint with 
the times. The country needed public participation by 
all in the era of political reconstruction, and the sub- 
sequent era of commercial expansion. But after the 
adoption of the Constitution, and after the winning of 
the West, there arose again a felt need for private con- 
templation. This need was supplied in part by the 
transcendentalists of New England. Emerson found 
in nature the ‘‘ dial plate of the invisible ’’; Upham 
saw in Christianity a field for the cultivation of the 
interior or hidden life. But this second mystical 
movement, like the first, was disturbed by a similar set 
of events,—another war, another period of reconstruc- 
tion, another territorial expansion. So it was not until 
the present generation that there was either leisure or 
occasion for the cultivation of quietism. 
Some have called the present phase New Thought. It 
should rather be called the oldest of thought in a new set- 
ting. As will be shown subsequently it is in large measure 
a revival of pagan mysticism and of medieval magic. 
The magical side we shall take up in another chapter, 
in treating of mental healing as it degenerated into the 
American form of mesmerism. The mystical side it is 
almost impossible to portray, except as we study by the 
outward comparative methods the spread of such a 
symptomatic movement as that called Christian Science. 
The sources of this system are inextricably confused. 
I have elsewhere pointed out that it contains a portion  
-P-A-G-E-52
44 EARLY IDEALISM 
  of the doctrine of the Yankee mesmeric ‘‘ healer,’’ 
Quimby of Maine; a portion of the doctrines of the 
Shaker prophetess, Mother Ann Lee of New Hampshire ; 
a portion of the orphic sayings of the transcendental 
rhapsodist, Bronson Alcott. But such dissection does 
not explain the vitality of the movement. For an ex- 
planation we must have recourse to the comparison of 
the statistics of the sect with conditions in various parts 
of the country. The statistics are to be found in the 
last federal census; the conditions are suggested by an 
interesting, but as yet unpublished map designating 
the absolute number of Christian Scientists in the land. 
A first glance at the map shows this threefold dis- 
tribution of the sect: the East, the Middle West, the 
Far West. By States this means Massachusetts and 
New York; Illinois and Missouri; Colorado and Cali- 
fornia. This confirms the official statement that the 
influence is strong over comparatively limited areas in 
the United States. In this threefold distribution the 
pathological factor is primarily in evidence, for the 
centers of influence are large cities, with their concomi- 
tant nervous disorders, and the health resorts of the 
mountains and coast, where it is natural that groups of 
invalids and semi-invalids should weleome any new 
therapeutic agency. But besides the physical there is 
a mental factor at work, besides ‘‘ Health,’’ there is 
“* Science,’’ and for the acceptance of the proffered 
metaphysics there are deeper and more subtle influences 
to be considered. The new gospel of mental medicine 
is also a system of philosophy. ‘‘ Hopelessly original,”’ 
as Mrs. Eddy calls it, the system appeals to those who 
are inclined to novelties. Tired of the dry doctrines 
of the churches, to most beginners in speculation, un- 
acquainted with the history of the schools, Christian
-P-A-G-E-53
  
MYSTICISM 45 
Science has all the air of discovery. Now such persons, 
who have, at the least, the merit of thinking for them- 
selves, are found chiefly in cities, and the acknowledged 
preponderance of urban over rural adherents is ex- 
plained by a third factor, that of free-thinking or a 
liberal attitude toward the unconventional. In the 
little town it is notoriously difficult to break from the 
dogma of local churches; it does not approve of changes 
in ecclesiastical caste. Free-thinking is, therefore, a 
second potent factor in the spread of Christian Science. 
The map of distribution by States discloses this. Con- 
necticut and New Jersey, with conservative colleges like 
Yale and Princeton, are far below the average of their 
more liberal neighbors. It is not so in Massachusetts, 
that hotbed of heresies; nor in Illinois, with its mixture 
of foreign faiths; nor in Colorado, early home of woman 
suffrage; nor lastly in California, pervaded with 
esoteric Buddhism and the doctrine of Maya,—of the 
world of sense as shadow and illusion. 
A third factor is financial. Christian Science has 
spread largely along the fortieth degree of latitude,— 
the richest pay-streak in our civilization. From their 
personal appearance and from the showiness of their 
churches the followers of ‘‘ scientific mental thera- 
peutics ’’ are manifestly prosperous. Yet with this very 
physical prosperity there goes a spiritual change. As 
in the case of those primitive Christian Scientists, the 
followers of Plotinus who centered in rich cities like 
Alexandria and Rome, so these modern Neo-Platonists 
tend to revolt against over-prosperity. With a plethora 
of wealth they incline toward asceticism, and long for a 
breath of the upper airs of mysticism. In a word, too 
much of the material has brought a desire for the 
immaterial.
-P-A-G-E-54
  46 EARLY IDEALISM 
This introduces a fourth factor in the distribution of 
the sect, for Christian Science as immaterialism has 
had, as a prepared soil, the previous American idealisms. 
If a mental isothermal line could be drawn for such a 
phenomenon, it would begin in Massachusetts, stretch 
to that historic projection of New England—the West- 
ern Reserve—and continue on with the latter’s pro- 
longation into Illinois. This, it should likewise be noted, 
was the path of Puritanism; westward the course of 
Calvinism took its way, and on this same path, seeking 
his audiences among those of New England stock, 
Emerson brought to the winners of the West the message 
that ‘‘ the spiritual principle should be suffered to 
demonstrate itself to the end.’’ 
Still another form of transcendentalism, not native 
but foreign, came into this region. The St. Louis school 
of German idealism, brought in by the refugees of the 
revolution of 48, worked its way up the Missouri and 
Mississippi and found a congenial soil in such Teuton- 
ized towns as Cincinnati and Chicago. Consequently, 
if one were to compare our given map with a philosophic 
map designating the areas of the early speculative 
movements in the country, this comparison would show 
that the preparation for the spreading of Christian 
Science was both positive and negative. Thus, where 
immaterialism was rife, it has followed; where ma- 
terialism flourished, it has gained little ground. The 
former fact has already been pointed out. Christian 
Science has run along the old grooves of New England 
transcendentalism, just as the latter ran along those of 
the older English Puritanism. Now, that the North 
has been continuously idealistic we know; but we are 
not so familiar with the fact that the South has been 
the opposite in its speculative spirit. Indeed, in the
-P-A-G-E-55
  
MYSTICISM 47 
generation before Emerson, there was a flourishing 
school of materialists down the Atlantic coast. Radiat- 
ing from the Philadelphia Medical School that influence 
spread chiefly below Mason and Dixon’s line. This 
would go to explain the peculiarity that Christian 
Science has found its line of least resistance north of 
that parallel and its line of greatest resistance south 
of it. 
How far there are deeper underlying causes for this 
complex result it would be hard to say. Lacking as yet 
an adequate map of the distribution of races in our 
land, we cannot state, with precision, to what extent 
idealism and materialism follow the paths of racial dis- 
tribution. But this, at least, is of significance,—that 
our Northern idealism has been Anglo-American, our 
Southern materialism Franco-American. In the North 
the philosophic succession has been through Emerson 
and Edwards back to the English Platonists like Cud- 
worth, Norris, and More. In the South that succession 
has been through Jefferson and Franklin back to the 
Gallic materialists like the authors of the System of 
Nature and Man a Machine. 
That these four factors are valid may be corroborated 
in a specific way. Take the case of the founder of the 
““ Church of Christ, Scientist.’’ First, as to the patho- 
logical factor. Mary Baker Glover’s prime search was 
for health; after her first marriage in 1848 she tried in 
turn allopathy, homeopathy, hydropathy, electricity, 
spiritualism, and mesmerism. Next, free-thinking af- 
fected her; like the more prominent New England re- 
ligionists she revolted against current Calvinism; ‘‘ the 
horrible decree of predestination,’’ she says, was ap- 
proached only to be abhorred. The third factor applies 
in only an indirect way. The invalid was of necessity
-P-A-G-E-56
48 EARLY IDEALISM 
  forced into painful ascetic practices. But the fourth 
factor, the search for an immaterial first principle, was 
one which has worked with especial strength on the 
discoverer of ‘‘ divine science.’’ The story of the inner 
life of Mary Baker is the story of a typical reaction to 
current philosophies. Negatively, there was a revolt 
against materialism; materia medica was rejected for 
“the higher attenuations of homeopathy ’’ and these 
prepared the imagination for a sheer immaterialism, 
where mind was everything and matter nothing. Posi- 
tively, there was an acceptance of contemporary ideal- 
ism, for the terms, though not the exactitudes, of Emer- 
sonianism are to be found scattered through Eddyism. 
The faithful will, of course, deny that the penumbra 
of Concord, Massachusetts, reached to Concord, New 
Hampshire, just as they have denied that Science and 
Health is an adumbration of the doctrines of the mag- 
netic healer Quimby. Nevertheless in both these cases 
the denial is not final. The author has pointed out 
elsewhere how the quarrel between Eddyites and 
Quimbyites can be settled by recourse to the solution 
of common sources,—the teachings of itinerant animal 
magnetizers who, like their master Mesmer, had inad- 
‘ vertently hit on the principle of suggestive therapeutics. 
In like manner, the affiliations between Eddyigm and 
transcendentalism tend to throw new light on tile prob- 
lem of distribution. Although it is difficult to discover 
any personal contact between the frequenters of Brook 
Farm and Mrs. Eddy when at Lynn, except for a flying 
visit paid her by the visionary Bronson Alcott; yet the 
appeal to both the academic transcendentalist and the 
New Hampshire seeress was the same. The earlier 
movement has been described by Frothingham as having 
its data secluded in the recesses of consciousness, out
-P-A-G-E-57
  MYSTICISM 49 
of the reach of scientific investigation, remote from the 
gaze of vulgar skepticism; esoteric, having about them 
the charm of a sacred privacy, on which common sense 
and the critical understanding might not intrude. Its 
oracles proceeded from a shrine, and were delivered by a 
priest or priestess, who came forth from an interior 
holy of holies to utter them, and thus were invested with 
an air of authority which belongs to exclusive and 
privileged truths, that revealed themselves to minds of 
a contemplative cast. To the pure transcendentalist the 
soul, when ‘awakened, utters oracles of wisdom, proph- 
esies, discourses grandly of God and divine things, per- 
forms wonders of healing on sick bodies and wandering 
minds. This form of transcendentalism was decried by 
Emerson as the Saturnalia or excess of faith, lacking 
the restraining grace of common sense. In the case of 
Mrs. Eddy this extreme mysticism took the following 
form. As she wrote to one of the directors of her 
church: ‘‘ I possess a spiritual sense. ...I can dis- 
cern in the human mind, thoughts, motives, and pur- 
pose; and neither mental arguments nor psychic power 
can affect this spiritual insight. . . . This mind reading 
is first sight; it is the gift of God... . It has enabled 
me to heal in a marvelous manner, to be just in judg- 
ment, to learn the divine Mind.”’ 
It would be interesting to hunt for the sources of 
these claims, for, if Eddyism be considered an after- 
clap of transcendentalism, a common ancestry can be 
traced through a series of intermediate links back to 
Neo-Platonism. At the least we can make a brief com- 
parison between the old and new ways of thinking. The 
old made the possibility of knowledge dependent on 
divine communications, the new claims that ‘‘ science is 
an emanation of eternal mind, and is alone able to in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
50 EARLY IDEALISM 
  terpret truth aright.’’ The old denied sensible existence 
and strained for something behind reality; the new 
“* reverses the testimony of the physical senses and by 
this reversal mortals arrive at the fundamental facts 
of Being.’’ The old had a contempt for reason and 
physical science; the new ‘‘ eschews what is called phys- 
ical science, inasmuch as all true science proceeds from 
divine Intelligence.’’ The old destroyed the distinction 
between sensible and intelligible, the new says, ‘‘ matter 
is but a subjective state of what is here termed mortal 
mind.’’ 
This recrudescence of Neo-Platonism in the New 
World is not surprising. Like causes have produced 
like effects, materialism, has been followed by imma- 
terialism, one mood being a natural recoil from the 
other. One outburst of mystic idealism occurred in 
New England a generation ago, for as Margaret Fuller 
explains of her contemporaries, it is ‘‘ because Ameri- 
cans are disgusted with the materialistic workings of 
rational religion that they become mystics; they quarrel 
with all that is, because it is not spiritual enough, since 
they acknowledge in the nature of man an arbiter for 
his deeds, a standard transcending sense and time.’’ At 
the present day, after the struggles of the Civil War and 
after the commercial expansion of the country, the same 
phenomenon is recurring under the form of the so-called 
New Thought. It would be going too far afield to at- 
tempt to explain the significance of the latter move- 
ment,—its occultism or love of the mysterious, its 
gnosticism or claim to peculiar knowledge, its affiliations 
with previous mystical systems,—but we can at least 
point out that Christian Science is but a single phase of 
a larger interest which ranges from the teachings of 
William James to the allegories of Maeterlinck.
-P-A-G-E-59
  MYSTICISM 51 
‘We may here examine, in conclusion, a final factor in 
the spread of the sect, namely the type of mind to which 
it appeals. In general that type is practical and yet 
uncritical, non-academic and yet speculative. Although 
the great mass of Christian Scientists consists of women 
who stand for the unrest of the new feminism, yet 
that given type is well represented by imaginative 
business men without a college training, such as are 
to be found in large cities, and such as predominate in 
the present directorate of the church. To carry out the 
analysis of the individual: in the first place such a man 
is practical, he wants results. When he sees benefits 
conferred upon his immediate circle he is led to specu- 
late as to the cause. Here, he says to himself, is the 
movement, and here is the result, therefore the ‘‘ demon- 
stration ’’ or the ‘‘ absent treatment ’’ must be the con- 
necting link. Now, this is the non-academic way of 
thinking. It belongs to that class of persons who are 
capable of framing a syllogism, but not capable of dis- 
covering its fallacious forms. To the academic or 
college-bred type ‘‘ demonstration,’’ ‘‘ absent treat- 
ment ’’ are as much matters of dubiety as ‘‘ mental 
telepathy ’’ or ‘‘ wireless mental messages.’’ Now the 
veriest undergraduate is taught the distinction between 
mind and matter, and is taught to keep the two spheres 
apart. Not so the business man. To draw such dis- 
tinctions is not in his line. Consequently, although he 
is a ‘‘ practical ’’ man, he will occasionally take a 
“« flier’? in a scheme that savors of alchemy, where 
secret formule are claimed to transmute metals, and, 
although a ‘‘ self-made ’’ man, he is often in fear of 
being overreached by some rival with more ‘‘ magnet- 
ism,’’ as if the latter possessed some sort of irresistible 
psychic effluence.
-P-A-G-E-60
52 EARLY IDEALISM 
And thus arises the failure to perceive the funda- 
mental fallacy of Christian Science; that, while it dis- 
claims materialism, it still reeks with materialistic 
terms. Even a recent edition of Science and Health, 
in spite of its countless recensions from the original 
Eddyite edition, contains such rubrics as ‘‘ Mental 
Offshoots ’’ and ‘‘ Gravitation Godward.’’ It also 
contains phrases of this sort: ‘‘ Astronomical order 
imitates the action of Divine Principle ’’; ‘‘ Mind, God, 
sends forth the aroma of Spirit, the atmosphere of In- 
telligence ’’; ‘‘ If the individuals have passed away, 
their aroma of thought is left which is mentally scented 
and described. Mind has senses sharper than the body ’’; 
“* Mental chemicalization, which has brought conjugal 
infidelity to the surface, will assuredly throw off this 
evil, and marriage will become purer when the scum is 
gone.”’ 
This fatal flaw, this failure to distinguish between 
mental and physical, is not recognized by the ordinary 
“* Scientist,’’ hence the ease with which strange doc- 
trines can be accepted. Christian Scientists deny the 
existence of the material, yet are reinforced in their 
beliefs by the latest physical discoveries. Just as Mes-— 
merism was helped by ‘‘ Franklinism,’’ the theory of 
psychic emanations by the fluid theory of electricity, so 
“absent treatment ’’ and silent ‘‘ demonstration ’’ are 
bolstered up by appeals to Hertzian waves, X-rays, and 
the like. 
In fine, Christian Science is liable to spread wherever 
fundamental distinctions fail to be made. Ignorant, 
then, of the real procedure of suggestive therapeutics, a 
procedure which has been confessedly neglected in our 
medical profession; ignorant also of such historic ap- 
proaches to Science and Health as have been made by
-P-A-G-E-61
  
MYSTICISM 53 
the classic mystic manuals from those of the Neo- 
Platonists to those of the Quakers, it is no wonder 
that, in the present state of American culture, Chris- 
tian Science spreads where there is a ‘‘ struggle for the 
recovery of invalids,’’ and where there is a ‘‘ yearning 
of the human race for spirituality.”’

CHAPTER III 
DEISM 
1, Tue Eneuiso INFLUENCES 
In deism as a movement toward free-thought we have 
a typical example of English influence upon the Ameri- 
can mind. It was a case of make haste slowly, for it was 
only by gradual degrees that British subjects emerged 
from the apologetic to the constructive, and from the 
constructive to the destructive type of free-thinking. 
The term free-thinker, as it first appeared in English 
philosophical literature, meant simply one whose thought 
is freed from the trammels of authority, who sought a 
characteristic Anglo-Saxon compromise between the 
Bible and the church on one side, and reason on the 
other. This was reflected in such works as Christian- 
ity Not Mysterious and Christianity as Old as the Crea- 
tion. 
Such an attitude was too vague, too apologetic. So it 
was succeeded by one more positive, more constructive. 
This attitude was reflected in a search for a natural or 
universal religion, a platform of belief on which all good 
men could unite. Such were the so-called five points 
common to all religions, which began with the existence 
of a Supreme Being and ended with future rewards and 
punishments. But constructive deism was, in turn, suc- 
ceeded by destructive. This began when natural religion 
was made to supplant revealed, when prophecies were 
eliminated, when miracles were considered not as props 
54 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
  THE ENGLISH INFLUENCES 55 
to belief but as mere myths. These three phases of 
English deism were exhibited in the colonies. The 
apologetic is represented by Cotton Mather in his 
Christian Philosopher, or A Collection of the Best 
Discoveries in Nature With Religious Improvements. 
The moderate is represented by Benjamin Franklin, 
who, with judicious vagueness, offered as his creed those 
old points common to all religions. The destructive is 
represented by Thomas Paine, who, in his Age of 
Reason, argues boldly against mystery and miracle. 
Deism, according to him, declares to intelligent man the 
existence of one Perfect God, Creator and Preserver 
of the Universe; that the laws by which he governs the 
world are like himself immutable; and that violation of 
these laws, or miraculous interference in the movements 
of nature must be necessarily excluded from the grand 
system of universal existence. 
American deism began in a reaction against Puritan 
determinism. The belief in a deity separate from the 
world, an idle spectator, an absentee landlord, was a 
logical rebound from the belief in a deity constantly 
interfering with the world, a magical intervener, a 
local busybody. Thomas Paine’s Age of Reason, with 
its notion of a creator whose ‘‘ arm wound up the 
vast machine ’’ and then left it to run by itself, formed 
a kind of counterpoise to Cotton Mather’s Magnalia 
Christi Americana, with its faithful record of many 
illustrious, wonderful providences, both of mercies and 
judgments, on divers persons in New England. In a 
way, also, these two books marked the transition between 
two different political points of view, one standing for 
class favoritism, the other for the natural rights of 
man. The Calvinistic doctrines of sovereign grace and 
an elect people savored too much of the claims of British
-P-A-G-E-64
  56 DEISM 
supremacy to be long acceptable. Hence the five points 
of Calvinism became so many points of irritation. 
Total depravity might apply to effete monarchies, 
but not to the New World; absolute predestination to the 
land of passive obedience, but not to the land where men 
sought to be free. 
Calvinism as a doctrine of necessity was, then, the 
proximate cause of deism as a doctrine of freedom. 
The notion of a partial and arbitrary deity prepared 
for the religion of humanity; the system of inscrutable 
decrees for a religion of reason. The change was strik- 
ing. Talk about creatures infinitely sinful and abom- 
inable, wallowing like swine in the mire of their sins, 
brought about a reaction, and the next generation went 
from the extreme of Puritanic pessimism to the ex- 
treme of deistic optimism, the belief in the perfectibility 
of the human race. This change in sentiment is recorded 
in the attacks on the old divinity. When the consistent 
Calvinist merely filed smooth the rough edges of a cast- 
iron system, the forerunners of the Unitarian movement 
boldly threw the dead weight overboard. To speak in 
reproachful language of the moral virtues, comparing 
them to filthy rags, was held absurd; while the Calvin- 
istic doctrine of the tendency of man’s nature to sin, 
as implying his utter and eternal ruin and the tor- 
ments of hell fire, was declared shocking to the human 
mind and contradictory to all the natural notions both 
of justice and benevolence. 
These protests against determinism were character- 
istic of early American deism; but behind these acute 
personal reactions there were larger and quieter forces 
at work. In a word the dogmas of an unnatural re- 
ligion were giving way to the principles of natural 
religion, and rationalism had at last a chance to assert  
-P-A-G-E-65
  COLONIAL COLLEGES AND FREE-THOUGHT 57 
itself. Here deism constituted the moving cause and the 
colonial college the vehicle in the transaction. 
2. THE CoLONIAL COLLEGES AND FREE-THOUGHT 
Deism, as a form of rationalism, had been hanging 
on the skirts of Puritanism during the last quarter of 
- the seventeenth century, but it was not until the 
eighteenth that it took to an independent growth and 
hastened the intellectual emancipation of New England. 
The old Boston Platform had recognized the light of 
nature, but more in the way of a forlorn negation 
than a hopeful affirmation. It spoke of natural reason 
as greatly impaired, saying that man retained no more 
of the light of reason than would conduce to torment- 
ing reflections. From these timid limitations there arose 
the desire for a change from a gloomy theology to a 
cheering theodicy, from the doctrine of inscrutable 
decrees to the belief in rational purpose and benevolent 
design in the universe. This change is marked by two 
such representative works as Mather’s Reasonable 
Religion and Chauncy’s Benevolence of the Deity. 
Cotton Mather did not attain his rationalistic results 
without some mental perturbation. At first his attitude 
was that of one opposed to the use of reason. Thus he 
uttered the warning: ‘‘ Hearken ye of Harvard and 
Yale College to old Eubulus, exhorting you with his 
counsel. In most academies of this world nothing is 
acquired but worldly wisdom; the philosophy taught in 
them is nothing but foolosophy.’’ After such strictures 
as these it is rather strange that Mather can avail him- 
self of rational arguments. But this he does in his 
Christian Philosophy, where he quotes with approval 
the statement of an English writer that the divine reason
-P-A-G-E-66
  58 DEISM 
runs like a golden thread through the whole leaden mine 
of brutal nature. Applying this principle to whatever 
he saw about him, he exclaims: 
How charming the proportion and pulehritude of the leaves, 
the flowers, the fruits. How peculiar the care which the great 
God of nature has taken for the safety of the seed and fruit! 
When the vegetable race comes abroad, what strange methods 
of nature are there to guard them from inconveniences. How 
nice the provision of nature for their support in standing and 
growing, that they may keep their heads above ground and 
administer to our intentions; some stand by their own strength, 
others are of an elastic nature, that they may dodge the violence 
of the winds: a visible argument that the plastic capacities of 
matter are governed by an all-wise infinite agent. Oh! the 
glorious goodness of our deity in all these things! 
There was a note in this little book that did not die. 
While its scientific arguments for design fell flat, its 
zsthetie elements lived on; it anticipated by a century 
the transcendentalist’s love of nature for its own sake. 
Mather might have said with Emerson ‘‘ Come into the 
azure and love the day.’’ Belonging to the same school 
of apologetic deists as Mather but of far higher rank 
was Charles Chauncy. In his Benevolence of the 
Deity, in place of a being cruel, inscrutable, acting by 
particular providences, we find a being benevolent, ra- 
tional, acting in harmony with wise goodness and accu- 
rate justice. The deity does not communicate being 
or happiness to his creatures by an immediate act of 
power, but by concurring with an established course 
of nature. He makes them happy by the intervention of 
second causes, operating in a stated, regular, uniform 
manner. 
Chauney’s work combines sound matter with a noble 
style; it marked a notable advance in the progress of
-P-A-G-E-67
  
COLONIAL COLLEGES AND FREE-THOUGHT 59 
rationalism. To teach that man is free and not deter- 
mined; active and not passive; perfectible and not de- 
praved, was to sum up the three great tenets of deism 
gained by way of painful reaction against the harsher 
doctrines of Calvinism. The way in which this reaction 
came about may be traced more closely in the later 
writings of the Harvard worthies, who possessed one 
notable means for the public expression of their views. 
This was the Dudleian lectureship founded for ‘‘ the 
proving, explaining, and proper use and improvement 
of the principles of natural religion.’’ The significance 
of this lectureship is that it furnishes an historical cross- 
section of the American mind. In it may be observed 
not only the rise and progress of deism, but also its 
destruction through a number of powerful solvents. The 
first of the Dudleian discourses furnishes an appropri- 
ate introduction to the whole course by giving an his- 
torical summary of the problems of dualism as con- 
nected with cosmology. Here President Edward Hol- 
yoke was the initial speaker: 
There were three opinions as to the existence of the world. 
One was that it was from Eternity, & Plato it seems, was the 
Father of it, and thought it flowed from God as Raies do from 
the Sun, where, by the way, we may note, That tho’ they tho’t 
the world to be eternal, yet that it proceeded from God; his 
Scholar also, Aristotle, propagated the same Notion & asserted 
that the world, was not generated so as to begin to be a 
world, which before was none. He supposes preexistent & 
eternal Matter as a Principle and thence argu’d the world to 
be eternal. . . . Another Opinion as to the Existence of the 
world, was that it came into this beautiful Form, by Chance, 
or a fortuitous concourse & jumble of Atoms, This is by all 
known to be the Philosophy of Epicurus, & his Notion was, 
that the Universe consisted of Atoms or Corpuscles of various 
Forms & Weights, which having been dispers’d at Random thro’ 
   
-P-A-G-E-68
60 DEISM 
the immense Space, fortuitously concur’d, into innumerable 
Systems or Worlds, which were thus formed, & afterward from 
time to time inereased, changing & dissolving again without 
any certain, Cause or Design, without the Intervention of any 
Deity, or the intention of any Providence. And yet this Phi- 
losopher did not deny the Existence of a God, but on the Con- 
trary asserted it, but tho’t it beneath the Majesty of the Deity 
to concern himself with humane affairs. ... But the most 
prevailing Opinion . . . was, That the world had a beginning, 
& was form’d by some great and excellent Being whom they 
called God. And this indeed is a tho’t that is perfectly agree- 
able to Reason. 
The first Dudleian lecturer granted that natural re- 
ligion was not unreasonable. A certain successor twenty 
years after argued for what he calls a coincidence of 
natural and revealed religion. He presents his argu- 
ments in a sort of imaginary conversation: 
  Reason would say: “ Surely this stupendous universe is the 
work of some invisible agent, beyond all comparison & con- 
ception superiour to man; for such a erand complete System 
so infinitely complicate, & yet so exactly adjusted in all its 
parts, the most minute as well as the grandest, that all kinds 
of symmetry and perfection concur to complete the whole, 
could never be the effect of chance or the product of endless 
essays & mutations of matter. This Agent must have an un- 
limited mind, to comprehend these vast innumerable works in 
one perfect Idea, before they were made. His power also 
must be equal to his unlimited understanding. And he is 
evidently as good as he is wise and powerful; otherwise 
malignity against his creatures would appear in universal 
discords through nature, perpetually generating all manners 
of evil. . . . In some such manner as this Reason in its perfect 
state might be supposed capable of arriving at the knowledge 
of the One True God, & deducing from thence a compleat 
system of natural religion. Yet it can hardly be conceived, 
according to our experience of the labour of searching out 
truth, that the human mind, in its utmost strength, could by
-P-A-G-E-69
  COLONIAL COLLEGES AND FREE-THOUGHT 61 
one glance of thought discover all the essential characteristics 
of the Deity, or the proper acts of worship & obedience which 
he requires. We might as well affirm, that unimpaired reason 
must naturally, at the first view of the heavenly bodies, have 
a clear knowledge of their magnitudes, distances and revolu- 
tions: or by looking round on the earth, immediately be 
acquainted with the innumerable gradations of animal life, & 
vegetable productions & fossils of all forms & kinds.... 
Therefore it may be justly questioned whether it would not 
have cost the labour of Ages to demonstrate a true System 
of religion, as it has taken nearly six thousand years to search 
out the laws of the material system & bring natural philosophy 
to its present perfection.” 
The arguments just presented were delivered in the 
year before the Declaration of Independence. It was 
not until after the second war with England that the 
Dudleian lectures show the weakening of the old con- 
servative scheme under the assaults of the destructive 
deists. But it remained for a lecturer of the year be- 
fore the publication of Emerson’s Nature to recog- 
nize the drift of a priori arguments for natural 
religion as leading to the self-sufficiency of nature. 
Abstract arguments, reasons John Brazer in 1835, are 
objectionable because they virtually assume the point to 
be proved. Thus, the axiom that every effect has a 
cause avails little with those who deny that the universe 
is an effect; the axiom that whatever begins to exist 
must have had a cause of its existence, will have no 
pertinency with those who, like the ancient and modern 
Epicureans, assert that the universe is eternal and the 
creative power, whatever it be, only plastic. Again, the 
statement that every contrivance must have a contriver 
is no argument to him who denies that there is any proof 
of contrivance further than the particular instance in 
question is concerned, as did Hume, Finally, the prin-
-P-A-G-E-70
  62 DEISM 
ciple that nothing can be a cause of its own existence 
will conclude little against him who asserts that the 
world is an exception to this general rule,—it being self- 
existent, as Spinoza maintained. 
‘We have here at Harvard an hypothetical approach 
to pantheism. In this free-thought had achieved a vic- 
tory over the old dualism. Instead of a creator and 
creation separated by a gap which could not be bridged, 
instead of 7 old doctrine of transcendence with which 
the apologet: ¢ deist had begun, we have now the doctrine

through some thirty-odd deistic works left to the col- 
lege library by Bishop Berkeley. These books did much 
to open the eyes of their reader; at the same time they 
did not lead him into the most radical skepticism. He 
recounts how he read Clarke’s Demonstration of the 
Being and Attributes of God, but did not find entire 
satisfaction; how he read Shaftesbury’s Character- 
istics and admired them as sublime views of nature 
and of the moral government of the Most High. But 
he could not go beyond this the Deist’s Bible and ac- 
cept the conclusions of the arch-skeptic Hume. Against 
the latter’s strictures upon the evidences of Christianity 
he exclaims, ‘‘ Shall a King be able by a Seal and other 
infallible Signatures to evince his Proclamations to 
his Subjects so that they shall have no doubt of his 
Majesty’s Will: and shall the Great Omnipotent King 
of the Universe be unable to evince & ascertain his Will 
to such a handfull of Intelligences the small System of 
Man? ”’ 
Having described the moral jaundice of the leader 
of skepticism in old England, Stiles as Anglus-Ameri- 
eanus turns to the movement in New England and 
gives a vivid account of the agitations of local thought 
during the French and Indian War:

Officers of the Army you entertain an Expectation favorable to 
Virtue. Far from this I imagine the American Morals & 
Religion were never in so much danger as from our Concern 
with the Europeans in the present War. They put on indeed 
in their public Conduct the Mark of public Virtue—and the 
Officers endeavor to restrain the vices of the private Soldiery 
while on Duty. But I take it the Religion of the Army is 
Infidelity & Gratification of the appetites... . They propa-

they ridicule the notion of moral accountableness, Rewards & 
Punishments in another life....I look upon it that our 
Officers are in danger of being corrupted with vicious prin- 
ciples, & many of them I doubt not will in the End of the 
War come home minute philosophers initiated in the polite 
Mysteries & vitiated morals of Deism. And this will have an 
unhappy Effect on a sudden to spread Deism or at least Scepti- 
cism thro’ these Colonies. And I make no doubt, instead of 
the Controversies of Orthodoxy & Heresy, we shall soon be 
called to the defence of the Gospel itself. At Home the 
general grand Dispute is on the Evidences of Revelation— 
some few of your small Folks indeed keep warming up the old 
Pye, & crying Calvinism, Orthodoxy &c—these are your 
Whitefields, Romaines, &¢ that make a pother: but the greater 
Geniuses among the Ministers are ranging the Evidences of 
Revelation to the public View, expunging the Augustine In- 
terpretations of Scripture with the other Corruptions of the 
Latin Chh, yet retained among protestants—and endeavoring 
a just & unexceptionable, rational Explication of the great 
Doctrines of the Gospel. The Bellamys &e of New England 
will stand no Chance with the Corruptions of Deism which, I 
take it, are spreading apace in this Comtry. I prophesy 
your Two Witnesses will avail more towards curing the Con- 
tagion than thousands of Volumes filled with cant orthodox 
phrases & the unintelligible Metaphysics of Scholastic Divinity, 
which is a Corruption of Christianity with arabian philosophy. 
Yet Stiles | was no such reactionary as some of his 
correspondents thought. He did not hold that the 
overvaluing of reason tends to promote atheism. When 
he was informed that Rector Clap would not suffer 
a donation of certain books from the free-thinking 
colony of Rhode Island, he wrote to the rigid Rector and 
made a notable appeal for unrestrained thought: 
. . . Different men indeed object from different motives, 
some from the Love of Orthodoxy & some from the Hatred
-P-A-G-E-73
  COLONIAL COLLEGES AND FREE-THOUGHT 65 
of it, & some from the generous Sentiments of that generous 
& equal Liberty for which Protestants & Dissenters have made 
so noble a Stand. It is true with this Liberty Error may be 
introduced; but turn the Tables the propagation of Truth 
may be extinguished. Deism has got such Head in this Age 
of Licentious Liberty, that it would be in vain to try to stop it 
by hiding the Deistical Writings: and the only Way left to 
conquer & demolish it, is to come forth into the open Field 
& Dispute this matter on even Footing—the Evidences of 
Revelation in my opinion are nearly as demonstrative as 
Newton’s Principia, & these are the Weapons to be used. 
Deism propagates itself in America very fast, & on this 
Foundation, strange as it may seem, is the Chh of Engld built 
up in polite Life. A man may be an excellent Chhman & yet 
a profound Deist. While public popular Delusion is kept up 
by Deistical Priests, sensible Laymen despise the whole, & 
yet, strange Contradiction! joyn it, and entice others to joyn 
it also—and they say all priests are alike, we all try to 
deceive Mankind, there is no Trust to be put in us. Truth 
& this alone being our Aim in fact, open, frank & generous 
we shall avoid the very appearance of Evil. 
The protest of Stiles was unavailing. Measures were 
now taken to stop the infiltration of any form of deism. 
By a vote of the president and fellows, students were 
to be established in the principles of religion according 
to the Assembly’s Catechism, Dr. Ames’s Medulla, and 
Cases of Conscience. Yale was now outwardly a strong- 
hold of orthodoxy ; how it came to be called a hotbed of 
infidelity is a matter of later times. It was not until 
after the Revolutionary War that the satirist could 
describe undergraduate skepticism, could tell how the 
clockwork gentleman was made ‘‘ twixt the Tailor and 
the Player, and Hume, and Tristram and Voltaire.”’ 
All this might have been expected. Action and re- 
action were equal. As at Harvard opposition had 
brought electicism, so at Yale the policy of sup-
-P-A-G-E-74
    66 DEISM 
pression brought an explosion of free-thinking upon 
the advent of the Franco-American deism of Citizen 
Paine and President Jefferson. 
Meanwhile it is in order to follow the fortunes of 
deism outside of New England, and to see how the other 
colonial colleges of the first rank were laid open to the 
advances of rationalism. 
The first head of King’s College, New York, destined 
to become the future Columbia University, was that 
Samuel Johnson who had been forced out of Yale be- 
cause of his liberal tendencies, which were early shown 
even in the reputed land of the blue laws. The very 
title of his most juvenile work, Raphael, or the Genius of 
English America, was a protest against colonial con- 
servatism. But Johnson’s actions spoke louder than his 
words. As an undergraduate he was warned against 
reading Descartes, Locke, and Newton; becoming a tutor, 
he introduced these works into the college library. As a 
theological student he was cautioned against a certain 
new philosophy, that of Berkeley, which was attracting 
attention in England, being told that it would corrupt 
the pure religion of the country and bring in another 
system of divinity. The warning was ineffective, for 
Johnson became a clergyman in the Church of England 
and sought to spread that very philosophy against which 
he had been warned. What trials met the students in 
the provincial seats of learning is suggested in a recently 
recovered manuscript entitled: The Travails of the In- 
tellect in the Mycrocosm and Macrocosm. In this ju- 
venile work Johnson leaves the little world of Puritan 
thought and emerges into the larger world of construct- 
ive deism. His scheme has as its beginning benevolence, 
and as its end evidences of cosmic design. This scheme 
was conceived by the author at the age of eighteen, but,
-P-A-G-E-75
  COLONIAL COLLEGES AND FREE-THOUGHT 67 
being obliged to conceal his opinions with caution, it 
was not for half a generation and through an English 
magazine that the young American was enabled fully to 
express his views. 
To show how judicious was the rationalism of this 
Introduction to Philosophy we may explain that the 
purpose of this small tract, ‘‘ by a gentleman educated 
at Yale College,’’ ‘was declared to be: the setting be- 
fore young gentlemen a general view of the whole sys- 
tem of learning in miniature, as geography exhibits a 
general map of the whole terraqueous globe. As in the 
natural so in the intellectual world, young students 
must have a prospect of the whole compass of their busi- 
ness and the general end pursued through the whole. 
We may here cite the case of another graduate of 
Yale, at King’s College, whose effusions, though light 
like straws, showed how the wind was blowing in the 
deistic direction. William Livingston, in his Remarks 
upon Our Intended College, wished to have the rules 
free to all, offensive to no sect. Fighting the efforts 
of the Episcopalians to obtain control of the institution, 
he was charged with deism and atheism. He thereupon 
retorted upon his opponents with a travesty of the 
Thirty-Nine Articles, whose tenor may be judged by the 
following: 
I. I believe the Scriptures of the Old and New Testa- 
ments, without any foreign comments or human explications 
but my own: for which I should doubtless be honoured with 
Martyrdom, did I not live in a government which restrains 
. that fiery zeal, which would reduce a man’s body to ashes for 
the illumination of his soul. . . . XXXIX. I believe that this 
ereed is more intelligible than that of St. Athanasius and 
that there will be no necessity for any to write an exposition 
of the Thirty-Nine Articles of my faith.
-P-A-G-E-76
  68 DEISM 
The position of King’s College in colonial free-think- 
ing was significant. It was a sort. of half-way house 
between the extreme puritanism of the North and the 
extreme deism of the South. The former had made God 
everything: the latter made man everything. Samuel 
Johnson was a mediator between these two views: his 
first book made the happiness of mankind to be God’s 
chief end; his last made the glory of God not incon- 
sistent with our pursuing our own happiness. 
To trace the further development of deism in the 
colonies, we pass over the College of New Jersey, de- 
fender of the faith, opponent of rationalism, and go on 
to Philadelphia and Franklin. 
3. PHILADELPHIA AND FRANKLIN 
‘I was scarce fifteen,’’ narrates Benjamin Franklin, 
“‘ when, after doubting by turns of several points, as I 
found them disputed in the different books I read, I 
began to doubt of Revelation itself. Some books against 
Deism fell into my hands; they were said to be the 
substance of sermons preached at Boyle’s Lectures. It 
happened that they wrought an effect on me quite con- 
trary to what was intended by them; for the arguments 
of the Deists, which were quoted to be refuted, ap- 
peared to me much stronger than the refutation; in 
short, I soon became a thorough Deist.’’ 
We have here the confession of the most precocious of 
the American skeptics. There is added to it an ex- 
planation which takes in, with characteristic inclusive- 
ness, the two factors of heredity and environment. 
Franklin explains that he was a free-thinker because of 
a free-thinking ancestor, and a deist because of a youth- 
ful overdose of Calvinism. Thus he relates how his
-P-A-G-E-77
  PHILADELPHIA AND FRANKLIN 69 
maternal grandfather had written some homespun 
verse in favor of liberty of conscience, and that his 
father’s little collection of books consisted mostly of 
polemical works of divinity. Although Franklin con- 
sidered that some of the dogmas of the Presbyterian per- 
suasion, such as the eternal decrees of God, election, 
reprobation, appeared very unintelligible and others 
doubtful, yet he never doubted that deity exists; that 
he made the world and governed it by his providence; 
that the most acceptable service of God was the doing 
good to man; that our souls are immortal; and that all 
erimes will be punished, and virtue rewarded, either 
here or hereafter. 
This creed was nothing but Herbert of Cherbury’s 
five points common to all religions, the veritable creed 
of a moderate deist, and yet Franklin tells how he was 
obliged to leave Boston when his indiscreet disputations 
about religion began to make him pointed at with horror 
by good people as an infidel and atheist. He next re- 
counts how, being employed in London, at the age of nine- 
teen, in composing as printer for Wollaston’s Religion of 
Nature Delineated, and some of the author’s reasonings 
not appearing well founded, he wrote a little metaphysi- 
cal piece entitled A Dissertation on Liberty and Neces- 
sity, Pleasure and Pain. The purport of this essay 
was to prove the doctrine of fate from the supposed 
attributes of God, reasoning in some such manner as 
this: That in erecting and governing the world, as he was 
infinitely wise, he knew what would be best; infinitely 
good he must be disposed, and infinitely powerful, he 
must be able to execute it; consequently all is right. 
Franklin stated that the printing of this ‘‘ wicked 
tract ’’ of 1725 was an ‘‘ erratum ”’ in the book of his 
life. That confession was probably meant to disarm
-P-A-G-E-78
  70 DEISM 
criticism. The deistic fatalism of this pamphlet was as 
nothing compared with the strange views set forth three 
years later in his Articles of Belief and Acts of Re- 
ligion. Drawn up among the regulations of the Phila- 
delphia Junto or club for mental improvement, this 
document formed a kind of shopkeeper’s litany, or home- 
service for young mechanics. Among its parts were the 
First Principles, Adoration and Petition, of which the 
last begged that the petitioner might be preserved from 
atheism and infidelity; the second urged the reading 
of deistic authors like Ray, Blackmore, and the Arch- 
bishop of Cambray; while the first, as if in conscious 
opposition to the Anglican creed, taught the doctrine, 
not of one God without parts and passions, but of many 
gods endowed with human passions. 
Here, then, follow Franklin’s peculiar 
FIRST PRINCIPLES 
I believe there is one supreme, most perfect Being, Author 
and Father of the Gods themselves. For I believe that Man 
is not the most perfect Being but one, rather that as there 
are many Degrees of Beings his Inferiors, so there are many 
Degrees of Beings superior to him. 
Also, when I stretch my imagination thro’ and beyond our 
System of Planets, beyond the visible fixed Stars themselves, 
into that space that is every Way infinite, and conceive it fill’d 
with Suns like ours, each with a Chorus of Worlds forever 
moving round him, then this little Ball on which we move, 
seems, even in my narrow Imagination, to be almost Nothing, 
and myself less than nothing, and of no sort of Consequence. 
When I think thus, I image it great Vanity in me to sup- 
pose, that the Supremely Perfect does in the least regard such 
an inconsiderable Nothing as Man. More especially, since it is 
impossible for me to have any positive clear idea of that 
which is infinite and incomprehensible, I cannot conceive
-P-A-G-E-79
  PHILADELPHIA AND FRANKLIN 71 
otherwise than that he the Infinite Father expects or requires 
no Worship or Praise from us, but that he is even infinitely 
above it. 
But, since there is in all Men something like a natural prin- 
ciple, which inclines them to pEvorion, or the Worship of 
some unseen Power; 
And since Men are endued with Reason superior to all other 
Animals, that we are in our World acquainted with; 
Therefore I think it seems required of me, and my Duty as 
a Man to pay Divine Regards to SomETHING. 
I conceive then, that the Inrinrre has created many beings 
or Gods, vastly superior to Man, who can better conceive his 
Perfections than we, and return him a more rational and 
glorious Praise. 
As, among Men, the Praise of the Ignorant or of Children 
is not regarded by the ingenious Painter or Architect, who is 
rather honour’d and pleas’d with the approbation of Wise 
Men & Artists. 
It may be that these created Gods are immortal; or it may 
be that after many Ages, they are changed, and others Supply 
their Places. 
Howbeit, I conceive that each of these is exceeding wise 
and good, and very powerful; and that Each has made for 
himself one glorious Sun, attended with a beautiful and 
admirable System of Planets. 
It is that particular Wise and good God, who is the author 
and owner of our system, that I propose for the object of 
my praise and adoration. 
For I conceive that he has in himself some of those Pas- 
sions he has planted in us, and that, since he has given us 
Reason whereby we are capable of observing his Wisdom in 
the Creation, he is not above caring for us, being pleas’d with 
our Praise, and offended when we slight Him, or neglect 
his Glory. 
I conceive for many Reasons, that he is a good Being; and 
as I should be happy to have so wise, good, and powerful a 
Being my Friend, let me consider in what manner I shall 
make myself most acceptable to him. 
Next to the Praise resulting from and due to his Wisdom, 
I believe he is pleas’d and delights in the Happiness of those  
-P-A-G-E-80
  72 DEISM 
he has created; and since without Virtue Man can have no 
Happiness in this World, I firmly believe he delights to see 
me Virtuous, because he is pleas’d when he sees Me Happy. 
And since he has created many Things, which seem purely 
design’d for the Delight of Man, I believe he is not offended, 
when he sees his Children solace themselves in any manner of 
pleasant exercises and Innocent Delights; and I think no 
Pleasure innocent that is to Man hurtful. 
I love him therefore for his Goodness, and I adore him for 
his Wisdom. 
Let me then not fail to praise my God continually, for it is 
his Due; and it is all I can return for his many Favours and 
great Goodness to me; and let me resolve to be virtuous, that 
I may be happy, that I may please Him, who is delighted to 
see me happy. Amen! 
Franklin’s First Principles form an astonishing docu- 
ment; they teach a veritable polytheism in a land 
monotonously monotheistic. We may postpone for a 
moment the search for the precise sources of this doc- 
trine and give a general reason for its rise. It was 
Franklin’s penetrating gaze that saw the essential weak- 
ness of the deistic tenet of transcendence. As the God 
of the deist was removed farther and farther from the 
world he became less and less an object of worship. This 
removal occurred in both time and space. On the one 
hand the conventional date of the creation was dis- 
counted; geology lengthened Genesis, and the coming 
into being of the world was thrust into the dark back- 
ward and abysm of time. The same thing happened in 
regard to space. The deity was dogmatically placed 
outside the framework of the visible universe, but as that 
universe was enlarged. its maker was necessarily put be- 
yond the uttermost bounds. So by a double process the 
deity became less an object of worship than a vague 
first cause at an infinite remove.
-P-A-G-E-81
  PHILADELPHIA AND FRANKLIN 73 
Franklin’s strange intermediate God was perfectly 
logical. More than that, his pluralism of divinities had 
a reputable literary source. There was the prevalent 
belief in a graded scale of reasoning life, as when Pope 
sought to discover ‘‘ what varied being peoples ev’ry 
star.’’? More particularly, there was the familiar scheme 
of Wollaston, who spoke of ‘‘the fixed stars as so many 
suns with their several sets of planets about them.”’ 
Finally, inserted in the midst of Franklin’s document, 
there was the ‘‘ Hymn to the Creator,’’ wherein Milton 
sang of ‘‘ Sons of light, angels, fixed stars.’’ But we 
have still more exact knowledge as to what was at 
the very bottom of these peculiar Articles of Belief. 
It is known that the original manuscript was Frank- 
lin’s daily companion to the end of his life, but it seems 
to have escaped notice, for a full century after his 
birth, how far he was indebted to Plato. Nevertheless 
it has been shown how Franklin’s writings give evidence 
that in his youth he fell under the spell of the ancient 
charmer. He tells how in his sixteenth or seventeenth 
year he procured the Memorabilia. From this he 
adopted the Socratic method of dispute, dropping abrupt 
contradiction and positive argumentation and putting 
on the humble inquirer and doubter. To Plato, then, 
we may trace the polytheism of the Philadelphian. For 
instance, the description, in the First Principles, of the 
Father of the gods themselves embodies the doctrines of 
the Timeus concerning the Father who begat the world 
and made the eternal gods, who formed the universe 
and assigned each soul to a star, who was good, and being 
free from jealousy, desired that all things should be as 
like himself as possible. 
Space is lacking in which to reproduce one of Frank- 
lin’s delightful dialogues in the classic style, nothing to
-P-A-G-E-82
  74 DEISM 
equal which for charm and fancy had so far appeared in 
the colonies. Space also is lacking in which to tell 
about his ethical schemes: his practical pocket-book for 
eradicating the vices; his Society of the Free and 
Easy, ‘‘ a sect that should be begun and spread at 
first among young and single men, each one of whom 
should exercise himself with the thirteen weeks’ examina- 
tion of the thirteen virtues, and only then should the 
existence of the Society be made a matter of public 
knowledge.’’ : 
We pass, therefore, from Franklin as the virtuous 
Poor Richard to Franklin as the advocate of free- 
thought. Here we should distinguish between his pri- 
vate and his public views. The best portraits of Frank- 
lin present as their mark of authenticity a secretive 
smile playing about his lips. This is characteristic. It 
suggests that what he expressed outwardly did not 
always obtain within. After his early speculative ‘‘ er- 
rata ’’ he assumed a cautious attitude toward religion 
as a public institution. Thus he writes to an anonymous 
correspondent, presumably Thomas Paine, that he has 
read his manuscript with some attention, but that the 
arguments it contains against the doctrine of a particu- 
lar providence strike at the foundation of all religion. 
He therefore gives as his opinion, that though the 
author’s reasonings are subtle, and may prevail with 
some readers, yet he will not succeed so as to change 
the general sentiments of mankind on the subject, and 
the consequence of the printing of the piece will be a 
great deal of odium drawn upon himself, and no benefit 
to others. He that spits against the wind spits in his 
own face. 
Of the same nature as this homely piece of advice 
was Franklin’s Information to Those Who would Re-
-P-A-G-E-83
  
PHILADELPHIA AND FRANKLIN 75 
move to America. Here he writes that, in the New 
World, religion under its various denominations is not 
only tolerated, but respected and practiced. Atheism 
is unknown there ; infidelity rare and secret ; so that per- 
sons may live to a great age in that country without hav- 
ing their piety shocked by meeting with either an atheist 
or an infidel. This is a jesuitical generalization, its 
truth being contradicted by the single fact that when 
Franklin made a motion for the holding of prayers in 
the Constitutional Convention, as a means of correcting 
the melancholy imperfections of the human understand- 
ing, he added in a satirical note, that the convention, 
except for three or four persons, held prayers to be 
unnecessary. 
These are contradictory statements, but there was a 
reason why Franklin’s writings and private beliefs did 
not hang together. The reason was his utilitarian point 
of view: he might consider free-thinking as a thing 
good in itself, but like his electric fluid, it was to be 
guided and conducted into safe channels. In spite of 
his general attitude of caution there were certain times 
when he took a firm stand against intellectual and re- 
ligious coercion. This was shown in the aid he extended 
to the radical Joseph Priestley, author of the Corrup- 
tions of Christianity; also in his request to Cadwallader 
Colden to stop prosecution of the editor of the New York 
Gazette, for publishing a defense of deism; and finally 
in his letter to Ezra Stiles of Connecticut, wherein he 
reiterates the deistic creed of his youth, confesses that 
he believes that primitive Christianity has received cor- 
rupting changes, and concludes with the observation that 
he does not perceive that the Supreme takes it amiss 
by distinguishing the unbelievers in his government 
of the world with any peculiar marks of displeasure.
-P-A-G-E-84
76 DEISM 
  The result of Franklin’s liberal policy was that Phila- 
delphia in his day was in the van of intellectual prog- 
ress. When John Adams sarcastically observed that the 
place considered itself the pineal gland of the United 
States, one might have retorted that that was true since 
Franklin was the seat of its intellect. It was due to his 
influence as founder that the University of Pennsylvania 
became noteworthy for requiring no religious test 
of its instructors, and for being so unprejudiced 
as to bestow an honorary degree even upon Thomas 
Paine. 
Forced to be cautious at home it was in France that 
Franklin came out in his true colors. On his mission to 
Paris in 1776 he showed a remarkable liveliness of 
spirits for a man of seventy. A kind of Socrates in small- 
clothes, he preserved to the last the ancient irony, the 
mastery of dialogue he had shown in his youthful es- 
says. Upon his arrival, being publicly introduced to 
Voltaire, he was hailed as the Solon embracing the 
Sophocles of the age. And Condorcet made the remark- 
able eulogy which contains the parallel between these 
two men as representatives of philosophy rescuing the 
race of man from the tyrant fanaticism. What the old 
diplomat was thought to believe at this time is told in 
a conversation which John Adams recounts having had 
with De Marbois, later secretary of the French legation 
in the United States: ‘‘ All religions are tolerated in 
America,’’ said M. Marbois, ‘‘ and the ambassadors have 
in all courts a right to a chapel in their own way; but 
Mr. Franklin never had any.’’ ‘‘ No,’’ said I, laughing, 
““ because Mr. Franklin had no——’”’ I was going to 
say what I did not say, and will not say here. I stopped 
short and laughed. ‘‘ No,’’? said M. Marbois, ‘‘ Mr. 
Franklin adores only great Nature, which has interested
-P-A-G-E-85
VIRGINIA AND JEFFERSON 77 
a great many people of both sexes in his favor.’’ 
“« Yes,’’ said I, laughing, ‘‘ all the atheists, deists, and 
libertines, as well as the philosophers and ladies, are in 
his train,—another Voltaire, and thenee——”’ ‘‘ Yes,’’ 
said M. Marbois, ‘‘ he is celebrated as the great philoso- 
pher and the great legislator of America.’’ 
4, VIRGINIA AND JEFFERSON 
As Philadelphia was intellectually dominated by Ben- 
jamin Franklin, so was Virginia by Thomas Jefferson. 
How firmly the latter stood for liberty of thinking is 
manifest in the President’s express desire to have in- 
scribed on his tomb: ‘‘ Author of the Declaration of 
American Independence, of the Statute of Virginia for 
Religious Freedom, and the Father of the University of 
Virginia.’’ As the advocate of free-thought in the Old 
Dominion, Jefferson was but the embodiment of his class. 
In contrast to the heresy-hunting Calvinists of the North, 
he typified the fox-hunting Arminians of the South. His 
earliest intellectual impressions were gained from that 
local species of Anglican clergy who, from reading the 
fashionable, skeptical literature of the mother country, 
came to be considered as lax in thought as they were 
reputed to be loose in living. 
Besides the Cavalier clergy, the College of William 
and Mary had marked influence on Jefferson’s mind. 
In addition to the liberty of philosophizing advocated 
in its charter the scientific spirit prevailed in the place. 
William Small, friend of Watt, the inventor of the 
steam engine, and of Erasmus Darwin, the grandfather 
of the evolutionist, came to the Virginia institution in 
1758, and Jefferson, who attended his lectures in natural 
philosophy, declared that he fixed the destinies of his
-P-A-G-E-86
  78 DEISM 
life. Adding to these liberalizing forces the elective 
system of studies, and the naturally volatile temper of 
the Southerner, it was inevitable that Jefferson should 
develop that receptive spirit which made him the typical 
progressive of his times. As he wrote in regard to the 
proposed University of Virginia: the Gothic idea that 
we are to look backwards instead of forwards for the 
improvement of the human mind, is not an idea which 
this country will endure. 
These were glittering generalities in education, but 
Jefferson backed them up by specific details. For the 
education of the young there was offered a scheme of 
Jeffersonian simplicity,—it was to start the inquiring 
student with books of a harmless sort and gradually 
and insidiously to wean him away from orthodoxy. He 
might begin with Hutcheson’s Moral Philosophy and con- 
tinue with Lord Kames’s Natural Religion, but he was to 
end with the Corruptions of Christianity by Dr. Samuel 
Priestley, the Anglo-American free-thinker. It was un- 
der the influence of the latter that the great deist in 
the White House, during the strenuous year of the 
Louisiana Purchase, took time to write what he called 
a Syllabus of an Estimate of the Merit of the Doc- 
trines of Jesus, compared with those of others. In this 
short work the author proposed to take first a gen- 
eral view of the moral doctrines of the most remarkable 
of the ancient philosophers; next, a view of the deism 
of the Jews, to show in what a degraded state it was; 
finally, to proceed to a view of the life, character, and 
doctrines of Jesus, who, sensible of the incorrectness of 
their ideas of the deity and of morality, endeavored to 
bring them to the principles of a pure deism. 
This Syllabus remained a mere sketch; knowledge of 
it leaked ” and public charges of atheism were brought
-P-A-G-E-87
VIRGINIA AND JEFFERSON 79 
against the President. Hence in the political agitations 
of the times Jefferson declared he had had no idea of 
publishing a book on religion, and that he should as 
soon think of writing for the reformation of Bedlam as 
the world of religious sects. So the former ambitious 
project for a study of comparative religions dwindled 
to a home-made harmony of the Gospels. As to the har- 
mony, Jefferson’s object was merely to take the four 
Evangelists and cut out from them every text they had 
recorded of the moral precepts of Jesus. There will be 
found remaining, he avers, the most sublime and benevo- 
lent code of morals which has ever been offered to man. 
‘*T have performed this operation for my own use,’’ he 
continues, ‘‘ by cutting verse by verse out of the printed 
book, and arranging the matter which is evidently his, 
and which is as easily distinguishable as diamonds in 
a dunghill.. The result is an octavo of forty-six pages 
of pure and unsophisticated doctrine.’’ 
This production, issued by Congress in its four- 
fold polyglot form—Greek, Latin, French, English—a 
full century after its inception, is the so-called Jefferson 
Bible. Bearing the title The Life and Morals of Jesus 
of Nazareth, the compiler acknowledges that it was at- 
tempted too hastily, being the work of two or three 
nights only at Washington, after getting through the 
evening task of reading the letters and papers of the day. 
To the larger undertaking Jefferson never went back, 
perhaps, because he realized that the réle of a philosoph- 
ical higher critic was an impossible one, that to dis- 
tinguish between primitive Christianity and later accre- 
tions was a task beyond the scholar of that age. Jef- 
ferson’s partial comparative studies remain as the most 
formal, but not as the sole expression of his beliefs. In 
addition to the Syllabus and the Bible there is a volu-
-P-A-G-E-88
80 DEISM 
minous correspondence, from which the Virginian’s 
somewhat motley philosophy may be reconstructed. In 
general, that philosophy was an eclecticism of a pro- 
nounced deistic type, since it was the very peculiarity 
of the deist to wear a patchwork philosopher’s cloak, 
yet to wear it in the fashion of the day. Thus, when on 
different occasions Jefferson exclaimed: ‘‘ I am an Epi- 
curean,’’? ‘‘I am a Materialist,’ ‘‘I am a sect by 
myself,’’ there was discoverable beneath these vari- 
ous disguises the strut and swagger of the age of 
reason. 
Of the different phases of thought through which Jef- 
ferson passed the most interesting was the materialistic. 
It was his five years’ residence in France, before the 
outbreak of the Revolution, that gave the free-thinking 
Southerner an insight into the possibilities of material- 
ism when earried to a logical outcome. As American 
minister Jefferson had the fortune to enjoy the society 
of the same lively set of spirits as did his predecessor, 
Franklin. Thus he could recall to Cabanis the pleasant 
hours he passed with him at the house of Madame 
Helvétius; confess that the French literati are half a 
dozen years ahead of the American, and yet make no 
effort to catch up with them. 
Here Jefferson’s fundamental deism held him back. 
Like the more moderate exponents of the Enlighten- 
ment, while disbelieving in a revealed, he was at the 
same time convinced of the advantages of a natural 
theology. So it was that ‘‘ the savage from the moun- 
tains of America,’’ living in the midst of the intellectual 
seductions of Paris, could still remain a believer in the 
Etre Supréme. The system of Diderot, D’Alembert, 
and D’Holbach was designated by his friend, Baron 
Grimm, an exposition of atheism for chambermaids and   
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  VIRGINIA AND JEFFERSON 81 
barbers. Jefferson, not so witty but more wise, criticised 
this extreme presentation more broadly and more 
soberly. Remarking that the atheistic was a more nu- 
merous school in the Catholic countries, while the in- 
fidelity of the Protestant took generally the form of 
deism, he puts the arguments of both sides thus: When 
the atheist descanted on the unceasing motion and cir- 
culation of matter through the animal, vegetable, and 
mineral kingdoms, never resting, never annihilated, al- 
ways changing form, and under all forms gifted with 
the power of reproduction; the theist, pointing ‘‘ to the 
heavens above and to the earth beneath and to the waters 
under the earth,’’ asked if these things did not pro- 
claim a first cause, possessing intelligence and power. 
Thus far Jefferson’s view of the universe was that 
of a moderate deist. The same attitude is taken in his 
characteristic compromise between the Epicurean doc- 
trine of the eternity of the world and the Puritanic 
doctrine of interference with the ordered course of na- 
ture. Calling himself a skeptical reader, he neverthe- 
less reasons on the supposition that the earth has had a 
beginning. However, he does not agree with those 
biblical theorists who suppose that the Creator made 
two jobs of his creation, that he first made a chaotic 
lump and set it in motion and then, waiting the ages 
necessary to form itself, stepped in a second time to 
create the animals and plants which were to in- 
habit it. 
The last phase through which the Southern thinker 
passed was that of natural realism, or that form of 
thought which emphasizes intuition and common sense. 
When he was young Jefferson recalls that he was fond 
of speculations which seemed to promise some insight 
into the hidden country. After his retirement from 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  82 | DEISM | 
active life he rests content in the belief that there is a 
reality which we directly recognize in beings, and that 
we are guided unconsciously by the unerring hand of 
instinct. In defense of his final faith in the common 
sense of moral sense the reminiscent statesman puts this 
patriotic question: If our country, when pressed with 
wrongs at the point of the bayonet, had been governed 
by its heads instead of its hearts, where should we have 
been now? Hanging on a gallows as high as Haman’s. 
The heads began to calculate and compare numbers; 
the hearts threw up a few pulsations of their warmest 
blood; they supplied enthusiasm against wealth and 
numbers; they put their existence to the hazard when 
the hazard seemed against us, and they saved the coun- 
try. 
To bring Jefferson’s philosophy into bolder relief it 
may be compared with that of John Adams, the cautious 
speculator and taster of systems, who, even in the days 
of their political rivalry, Jefferson considered ‘‘ as dis- 
interested as the being who made him.’’ Now, it was 
after their reconciliation through Benjamin Rush that 
the correspondence between the Whig and the Federal 
ex-presidents discloses two gentlemen of the old school, 
both omnivorous readers, both averse to Calvinism and 
clerical obscurantism, both interested in the rising 
study of comparative religion, both tinged with the 
eurrent deistic thought. Of the two the Southerner 
was more prone to generalizations, more impatient of 
other men’s beliefs; the Northerner more tolerant, not 
inclined to g0 beyond ‘‘ New England guesses.’’ ‘‘ The 
=a Chief of Monticello is such a heterodox   and hungry fellow,’’ so runs a doggerel couplet of the 
day; Adams appears equally versatile but far less ar- 
dent. rn afflicted with a kind of Pyrrhonism,
-P-A-G-E-91
  
VIRGINIA AND JEFFERSON 83 
he numbers himself among those Protestants qui ne 
croyent rien. 
Adams’s ironical deprecation of his own knowledge was 
doubtless one reason for Jefferson’s drifting away from 
the Gallic speculation. Adams is sensible of the services 
of the French philosophers to Liberty and Fraternity, 
yet he cannot but think that they are all destitute of 
common sense: 
They all seemed to think that all Christendom was convinced 
as they were, that all religion was “visions Judaicques” and 
that their effulgent lights had illuminated all the world. They 
had not considered the force of early education on the millions 
of minds who had never heard of their philosophy. And what 
was their philosophy? The universe was matter only, and 
eternal; spirit was a word without a meaning. All beings 
and attributes were of eternal necessity; conscience, morality, 
were all nothing but fate. Who, and what is fate? He must 
be a sensible fellow. He must be a master of science. He 
must calculate eclipses in his head by intuition, and what is 
more comfortable than all the rest, he must be good natured, 
for this is upon the whole a good world. 
In these jocular criticisms there was a sly dig at 
Jefferson’s deism. The French fate bore a striking 
resemblance to his benevolent deity, trust in whom would 
bring the philosophic millennium. And so Adams writes 
again: ‘‘ Let me now ask you very seriously, my friend, 
where are now in 1813, the perfection and the per- 
fectibility of human nature? Where is now the progress 
of the human mind? Where is the amelioration of so- 
ciety? . . . I leave those profound philosophers to enjoy 
their transporting hopes, provided always that they will 
not engage us in French Revolutions. . . .’’ And so 
throughout the correspondence,—the impartial Novan- 
glian meets the strenuous Virginian with whimsical 
advice. When as Epicurean he becomes too stoical, he
-P-A-G-E-92
  84 DEISM 
urges him to eat his canvas-back duck; when as deist he 
becomes too dogmatical, he remarks: ‘‘ It has been long, 
very long, a settled opinion in my mind, that there is 
now, never will be, and never was but one being who 
can understand the universe. And that it is not only 
vain, but wicked, for insects to pretend to compre- 
hend it.”’ — 
It was easy for Adams to write in this way; an ag- 
nostic’s apology was tolerated in the case of one who 
would leave ‘‘ metaphysics in the clouds.’? But with 
Jefferson things were different; politics complicated the 
situation and faction spoiled philosophy. The Federal- 
ists linked together Jeffersonianism, atheism, and the 
excesses of the French Revolution. They called the 
President a Jacobin, an infidel, and a republican villain. 
They spoke of a dangerous, deistical, and Utopian 
school of which a great personage from Virginia was 
a favored pupil. They said his principles relished so 
strongly of Paris, and were seasoned in such a pro- 
fusion of French garlic, that he offended the whole na- 
tion. In these attacks the Federal clergy of New Eng- 
land were implicated. When Jefferson had brought 
over from France the arch-infidel Thomas Paine in a 
government ship, they spoke of him as an Ephraim who 
had become entangled with the heathen. Jefferson’s 
defenders were unable to mend matters. The author of 
the Hamiltoniad, or an Extinguisher of the Royal Fac- 
tion of New England dismisses the worn-out tale of the 
President’s irreligion by retorting that ‘‘ he has thrown 
into the lap of Morality the purest apothegms of the 
Apostles and Fathers; he confounds the politicians by 
calling them Tory bloodhounds, yelping upon the dan- 
gers that may arise from the Virginian or Southern in- 
fluence.’’? These mixed metaphors betray a political 
|
-P-A-G-E-93
VIRGINIA AND JEFFERSON 85 
  confusion in which Jefferson found it hard to pre- 
serve a philosophic calm. He asserted that the priests, 
to soothe their resentments against the act of Virginia 
for establishing religious freedom, wished him to be 
thought atheist, deist, or devil, who could advocate free- 
dom from their religious dictations. Having opposed 
the scheme of a state-supported church—‘‘ Christianity 
for pence and power ’’—he pronounced Massachusetts 
and Connecticut the last retreat of monkish darkness 
and bigotry. 
And so against the narrowness of the North and as 
a bulwark against the ‘‘ pious young monks of Harvard 
and Yale,’’ Jefferson proposed to erect his Southern 
University. In the plan for this institution which he 
proposed to the Virginia legislature, he intended to 
place the entire responsibility for religious training 
upon an ethical basis, where all sects could agree. As he 
explained the matter: ‘‘ The proofs of the being of a God, 
the creator, preserver and supreme ruler of the uni- 
verse, the author of all the relations of morality, and 
the laws and obligations these infer, will be within the 
province of the professor of Ethics; to which adding 
the development of these moral obligations in which all 
sects agree . . . a basis will be found common to all 
sects.’’? Because of his plan of having no professorship 
of divinity and allowing independent schools of the- 
ology to be established in the neighborhood of the Uni- 
versity, Jefferson complained that a handle had been 
made to disseminate an idea that this is an institution, 
not only of no religion, but against all religion. But in 
spite of his opponents’ fulminations ‘‘ the liberality of 
this State,’’ concludes the Virginia humanist, ‘‘ will 
support this institution and give fair play to the cultiva- 
tion of reason.’’

5, THomas PAINE AND PopuLar DEISM 
In examining the books of the early colleges and the 
thoughts of their representative men, there have been 
found numberless signs of colonial free-thinking, of 
mental independency before political independence. In 
addition to these academic studies there must now be 
made a search for the more elusive traces of the spread- 
ing of infidelity, before the actual outburst of revolu- 
tionary thought. As has been already intimated, this 
movement, beginning as a popular reaction, was more 
felt than avowed, more a matter of subtle distrust than 
of precise knowledge. It was the faint smoke in the 
air, presaging the coming forest fire. It was a time 
when the clergy might warn against ‘‘ the insidious 
encroachments of innovation,’’ but when the laity pre- 
ferred the Indian summer of indifference. Toleration 
was pervasive. It has been described as gradually dif- 
fused over the land by such fostering circumstances as 
colonial impatience with prescription and custom, and 
that original adventurous spirit which, combined with 
dissatisfaction with home conditions and voluntary 
exile, insensibly fitted the mind for the propositions of 
liberty. 
Of these propositions, the liberty to think and feel 
as one liked was the most conducive to the coming of 
free-thought. Paine’s Age of Reason was especially op- 
portune because it was in agreement with that liberty 
of conscience granted or implied in so many of the Revo- 
lutionary documents. Among these documents we may 
refer to Patrick Henry’s Bill of Rights, in which he 
held that religion can be directed only by reason. To 
this Madison added that all men are equally entitled to 
the full and free exercise of religion according to the
-P-A-G-E-95
  THOMAS PAINE AND POPULAR DEISM 87 
dictates of conscience. This was followed in 1785 by 
Jefferson’s Declaratory Act, establishing religious free- 
dom in Virginia, and by the Pennsylvania constitution, 
advocated by Franklin, which contained the clause as to 
the natural and inalienable right to worship according to 
the dictates of the understanding. In brief, twelve out 
of the thirteen original States allowed an increased 
measure of mental freedom. It was only in Massa- 
chusetts that a dread of liberty was expressed. There 
we find the question debated as to whether public offices 
might not be held ‘‘ even among those who have no 
other guide to the way of virtue and heaven, than the 
dictates of natural religion.’’ 
The political expressions of rationalism in the Revo- 
lutionary period are many, the philosophical few. Be- 
tween the Stamp Act and the adoption of the Constitu- 
tion, there was but one native work worth mentioning 
in the deistic connection. But Ethan Allen’s Reason 
the Only Oracle of Man did not arrest the popular at- 
tention. So it remained for a naturalized American to 
turn the tide of thought. It was the Age of Reason of 
Thomas Paine which marked high water in the deistic 
movement, for it was carried upon the wave of enthusi- 
asm caused by the author’s Revolutionary pamphlets 
Common Sense and the Rights of Man. The radical 
writer affirms that, as his motive in his political works 
had been to rescue man from tyranny and false sys- 
tems and false principles of government, so in his re- 
ligious publications it was to bring man to the right 
reason God had given him, unshackled by fable and the 
fiction of books. 
The Age of Reason is a perfect example of the popu- 
larizing of current deistic opinions. It has the same 
method of so-called mathematical proof, the same me-
-P-A-G-E-96
  chanical view of nature, the same disregard of the 
problem of evil, the same aversion to mystery, the same 
iridescent dream as to mankind’s perfectibility, the 
same delusion as to monotheism being a primitive be- 
lief,—‘‘ Adam was created a deist’’ says this prehis- 
toric critic. In a word, the book is anything but origi- 
nal. With the exception of a phrase or two like the 
“* religion of humanity,’’ there is not an idea in it which 
cannot be matched in the writings of the English free- 
thinkers of the Georgian era. Paine simply repeats, in 
the language of the street, the arguments of Collins 
against prophecy, of Woolston against miracles, of 
Tindal against revelation, of Morgan against the Old 
Testament, of Chubb against Christian morality. 
This is the negative side of the book. More effective 
is the positive. In place of the false ‘‘ bases of Chris- 
tianity ’’ Paine would put what he calls a true theology. 
He cannot see how man can hold to a system where 
Satan is deified and given power equal to that of the 
Almighty; where man is called an outcast, a beggar, a 
mumper, calling himself a worm and the fertile earth a 
dunghill, and all the blessings of life but the thankless 
name of. vanities. But there is a substitute for all 
these corruptions ‘‘ from Moloch to modern predesti- 
narianism,’’—it is eighteenth-century optimism, thus 
grandiloquently set forth: If objects for gratitude and 
admiration are our desire, do they not present them- 
selves every hour to our eyes? Do we not see a fair 
creation prepared to receive us the instant we are born 
—a world furnished to our hands, that costs us noth- 
ing? Is it we that light up the sun; that pour down 
the rain; and fill the earth with abundance? Whether 
we sleep or wake, the vast machinery of the universe 
still goes on.  
-P-A-G-E-97
    
  THOMAS PAINE AND POPULAR DEISM 89 
The effect of the Age of Reason on the community 
may be easily imagined. The clergy attacked it, the 
colleges criticised it, but the populace read it. Dedi- 
cated to the author’s fellow-citizens of the United States 
of America, it was sold for a few pence the copy or 
given away gratis. The first edition, printed in France, 
was spread broadcast through the free-thinking so- 
cieties affiliated with the Jacobin Club of Philadelphia. 
Within two decades the pamphlet was to be found on the 
banks of the Genesee and Ohio; within two more it was 
circulated among the readers of Volney and Voltaire 
and in those places in Tennessee and Kentucky whose 
names still attest the French sympathies of the first 
settlers. It is astonishing how far the light of nature 
threw its beams. The president of Transylvania Uni- 
versity was suspected of teaching an unrestrained natu- 
ralism, and a friend of Abraham Lincoln reported that 
in Indiana the Age of Reason passed from hand to hand, 
furnishing food for the evening’s discussion in tavern 
and village store. 
The book, moreover, met with that sincerest form of 
flattery—imitation. An example of this was Elihu Palm- 
er’s Prospect, or View of the Moral World for the Year 
1804. According to the allegorical thunder and light- 
ning frontispiece, the Book of Saints and Ten Command- 
ments are being dashed to the ground from the Altar of 
Truth and Justice to be supplanted by the Age of Rea- 
son and the Rights of Man. Of an equally destructive 
aspect was George Houston’s New York Correspondent 
of 1829, containing lectures delivered before the Free 
Press Association on the inconsistencies, absurdities, and 
contradictions of the Bible. This journal also presented 
the advanced views of Fanny Wright, a sort of Wilhelm 
Meister in petticoats, who wandered over the country
-P-A-G-E-98
  90 DEISM 
from Woodstock, Vermont, to Cincinnati, Ohio. The 
opponents of popular deism now raised their heads. 
The free-thinking societies, spread through New Eng- 
land and the Middle States, were designated the 
banded Goths and Vandals of political atheism. The 
author of the Sceptic’s Manual retailed petty and ma- 
licious gossip concerning the last days of Hobbes and 
Hume, Voltaire and Paine. In the Antidote to Deism, 
Ethan Allen is called an ignorant and profane deist, 
Paine a drunkard, to reason with whom would be like 
casting pearls before swine. 
Such were the attacks of the minor clergy. In the 
colleges the battle was waged more in accordance with 
the rules of war. The most prolific of the writers against 
deism, and the materialism which happened to be asso- 
ciated with it, was President Timothy Dwight of Yale. 
As one of the Hartford wits, he had composed a sort of 
American Dunciad, the Triumph of Infidelity, which 
was ironically dedicated to Voltaire. How that poem 
confined the deist in the pillory of his own terms, and 
flung into his teeth his own arguments, is to be seen 
from these lines: 
“His soul not cloath’d in attributes divine; 
But a nice watch-spring to the grand machine. i 
Enough, the Bible is by wits arraigned, 
Genteel men doubt it, smart men say it’s feigned.” 
| 
In contrast to this effusion were the earlier poems of 
Dwight’s salad days which showed a decided leaning to 
the philosophy of the French Encyclopedists. In the 
Columbia and the Conquest of Canaan, French 
phrases are curiously wrought into a sort of biblical 
epic on the New World. The sons of this ‘‘ blissful Eden
-P-A-G-E-99
ee 
THOMAS PAINE AND POPULAR DEISM 91 
bright ’’ are urged to ‘‘ teach laws to reign and save the 
Rights of Man.’’ The author subsequently explained 
that these were the mock heroics of a time when the 
strong sympathy towards the leaders of the French 
Revolution prepared to make us the miserable dupes of 
their principles and declarations. But the doctrines of 
the 14th of July were not to be confused with those of 
the 4th of July. As the head of Yale College, Dr. 
Dwight became the leader of the forces against deism. 
His Century Discourse gives a trenchant account of the 
progress of infidelity,—its descent from the lofty philo- 
sophical discourse to the newspaper paragraph, its 
spread among the masses, and the ultimate return to 
more sober thought. ‘‘ Infidelity,’’ the discourse pro- 
ceeds, ‘‘ was first theism, or natural religion, then mere 
unbelief, then animalism, then skepticism, then partial, 
and finally, total atheism. The infidel writers have used 
terms so abstract, and a phraseology so mysterious as to 
attract readers fond of novelty, but the common people, 
never honored by Voltaire with any higher title than the 
rabble or the mob, have been caught by these writers, 
who volunteered to vindicate their wrongs and assert 
their rights. Happily it was soon discovered that the 
liberty of infidels was not the liberty of New England; 
that France instead of being free, merely changed 
through a series of tyrannies; and that man, unre- 
strained by law and religion, is a mere beast of prey. 
Even sober infidels began to be alarmed for their own 
peace, safety, and enjoyments.’’ 
The air of gravity and severity about this passage is 
explained by what men remembered of the events fol- 
lowing the peace of 1783, the intrigues of Genet, the 
terrorism incited by Freneau, when Market Street, 
Philadelphia, was filled with a mob, the distrust of
-P-A-G-E-100
92 DEISM 
    Napoleon implied in President Adams’s proclamation. 
This passage is also explained by the wild and vague 
cxpecieHits everywhere entertained, especially among 
the young, of a new order of things about to commence, 
in which Christianity would be laid aside as obsolete. 
In the exultation of political emancipation, infidel 
philosophers found ready listeners when they repre- 
sented the restraints of religion as fetters of the con- 
science, and moral obligations as shackles imposed by 
bigotry and priestcraft. 
At Harvard College, the academic attitude toward 
deism wee somewhat complicated. Federal in politics 
and Unitarian in religion, it was doubly averse to the 
enthusiasms and raptures of Franco-American rational- 
ism; it deplored the ‘‘ foul spirit of innovation,’’ and 
sought some check to the ‘‘ infuriated steeds of in- 
fidelity.”’ At Princeton the Age of Reason was opposed 
by the philosophy of common sense. Where Berkeleian 
idealism had been driven out, the Bridgewater Treatises 
came in. According to its catalogue, the library 
abounded in volumes like Dick’s Celestial Scenery Illus- 
trating the Perfections of the Deity, and Prout’s Chemis- 
try, Meteorology and the Functions of Digestion consid- 
ered with reference to Natural Theology. The favorite 
text-book, as in the majority of conservative colleges, 
was mat Stewart, and Stewart’s aim was declared 
to be to stem the inundation of the skeptical, or rather 
atheistical publications which were imported from Eu- 
rope. But a conservative literature does not alone ex- 
plain the stringent policy of Princeton; behind the 
books were such facts as that, after the revolutionary 
war when the students had been ‘‘ freed from all sanc- 
tuary ay Sabbath restraint,’’ there was left only a 
handful of students who professed themselves Christians 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  THOMAS PAINE AND POPULAR DEISM 93 
and that, in 1802, the trustees in their ‘‘ Address to the 
Inhabitants of the United States,’’ declared that their 
purpose was to make this institution an asylum for pious 
youth, in this day of general and lamentable depravity. 
Popular deism was rejected by the clergy and thrust 
out by the colleges. It remains to be seen how the pub- 
lie first accepted, then grew tired of it. Chancellor 
Kent said that in his younger days there were very few 
professional men who were not infidels; Ezra Ripley, 
that a large portion of the learning not possessed by the 
clergy leaned to deism. A few specific events will illus- 
trate how this rapid growth of the army of free-thinkers 
was followed by an equally rapid defection from the 
ranks. In 1801, James Dana of Connecticut said that 
infidelity appeared to be gaining ground; by 1810, it 
was reported that infidelity abounded to an alarming 
degree and in various shapes in the district west of the 
Military Tract in New York. In 1822 an anonymous 
“letter to a deist in Baltimore ’’ stated that deism is 
taking root rapidly and soon will grow up surprisingly 
and become the only fashionable religion. In Virginia 
about the same time Bishop Meade asserted that in every 
young man he met he expected to find a skeptic, if not an 
avowed unbeliever. 
This was the advance of the movement. A reaction 
followed which started in protests from the church, the 
state, and the professions, and ended in a series of re- 
ligious revivals. In 1798, the Presbyterian General 
Assembly uttered a warning against the abounding in- 
fidelity which tends to atheism itself; in 1800, the Presi- 
dent referred to the dissemination of principles sub- 
versive of the foundations of all religious, moral, and 
social obligations, that have produced incalculable mis- 
chiefs in other countries; in 1824, Dr. Charles Caldwell
-P-A-G-E-102
thought fit to write a Defence of the Medical Profession 
against the charge of Infidelity and Irreligion. The 
unpopularity of deism is likewise exhibited in the light 
cn of the day. Fenimore Cooper describes one 
of his heroines as being properly impressed with the 
horrors of a deist’s doctrines, and another as shrinking 
from his company. Harriet Martineau wrote back to 
England how she was told of one and another with an 
air of mystery, like that with which one is informed of 
any penn being insane, or intemperate or insolvent, 
that so and so was thought to be an unbeliever. 
The results of deism in America may now be briefly 
summed up. Among the people the majority were 
drawn off by an emotional substitute for thought, the 
revivals that swept over the country. At bottom the 
deistic system was too cold and formal; it externalized 
deity, lacked a continuing enthusiasm, and so failed to 
satisfy the eravings of emotional excitement. The 
philosophy of a Franklin might appeal to the business, 
it did not appeal to the bosoms of men. In the colleges 
those who were not affected by revivalism were held 
in check by circumscribed courses presenting the simi- 
larities between natural and revealed religion. Finally, 
among the clergy, the great part stood for orthodoxy. 
As expressed by one of the numerous century sermon- 
izers, there was no neutral ground to be taken between 
evangelical doctrines and infidelity. 
Such were the results of the hundred years’ war for 
free-thinking,—apparently fruitless unless judged by 
later events. One such event was New England tran- 
scendentalism, whose programme on its negative side was 
almost precisely what the deists had been denying; on 
its positive, an assertion of what they had been lacking. 
Transcendentalism denied the need of miracle, revela-

-P-A-G-E-103
THOMAS PAINE AND POPULAR DEISM 95 
tion, dependence on an outward standard of faith; it 
affirmed the need of intuition, mystic ecstasy, inward 
dependence upon an immanent life. As the philosopher 
of Concord exclaimed: ‘‘ Here is now a perfect religion, 
which can be set in an intelligible and convincing man- 
ner before all men by their reason.’’ 
   
-P-A-G-E-104
CHAPTER IV 
MATERIALISM 
1, Tue Frencu INFLUENCES 
  Tue story of materialism in America is the story of 
a struggle for existence but not of the survival of the 
fittest,—so at least thought its opponents. The move- 
ment was at first chiefly described by those who were 
hostile to its spirit and its aim. As a form of genial 
naturalism it was in marked contrast to the austere 
supernaturalism of the North. And yet it is to its 
Northern adversaries that we must go for our earliest 
accounts. One of the founders of the Harvard Medical 
School explains that modern philosophers say matter is 
inert, yet that there are certain powers which the par- 
ticles of matter have of acting on one another, as 
gravitation, cohesion, the attraction of crystallization, 
of magnetism, of electricity, of chemical attraction. But 
none of these merit the name of vitality, nor in them 
is the origin of intelligent ideas to be looked for. Sen- 
sible objects may be the destined medium to awaken the 
dormant energies of man’s understanding, yet these 
energies are no more contained in sense than the ex- 
plosion of the cannon in the spark which gives it fire. 
Again Noah Webster, the lexicographer, has ‘‘ some 
doubts ’’ concerning Erasmus Darwin and his ‘‘ laws of 
organic life.’’ The author of such ‘‘ laws ’’ by merely 
observing the phenomena of animal motion might trace 
them to fibrous contractions, and fibrous contractions to 
96
-P-A-G-E-105
  THE FRENCH INFLUENCES 97 
irritation of external objects, to pleasure, pain, voli- 
tion, or association; but at last he is compelled to in- 
quire why and how the fibers become obedient to the 
impulses of stimulus. Mounting a step higher in the 
eatenation of causes, he is compelled to create or imagine 
a certain something to reside in the medullary sub- 
stance of the brain to which he gives the denomination 
of the spirit of animation. What this principle is he 
makes no attempt to explain; and the very existence of 
it is rather assumed than proved. 
These opinions represent the jealous attitude of the 
North toward the prevalent system of the South. A 
fairer and indeed a mediating attitude was taken by a 
writer of the Middle States. Reviewing the opinions of 
the principal materialists of the eighteenth century 
Samuel Miller of Princeton shows how they resemble 
those of the ancients. Just as when Epicurus supposed 
the soul of man to be a material substance, but a very 
refined and attenuated kind of matter, so Dr. Priestley 
denies that there is any ground for making a distinction 
between the soul of man and the body, supposing the 
whole human constitution to be made up of one homo- 
geneous substance. 
In turning from the English to the French material- 
ists such as Condillac and Helvétius, the Princetonian 
touches on the heart of the matter. The real agents for 
the naturalizing of French materialism in the South 
were Franklin and Jefferson. It was Franklin as a 
philosopher, in the eighteenth-century use of the word 
as a natural philosopher, who chiefly stimulated the in- 
terchange of ideas between France and the western 
world. Had it not been for the Philadelphian’s elec- 
trical experiments, there would have been fewer points 
of contact between the two republics. The modern
-P-A-G-E-106
  98 | MATERIALISM 
Prometheus drew lightning from the clouds, as Turgot’s 
famous lines expressed it; he also drew ideas from men, 
and despite that non-conducting medium, the Anglo- 
American mind, succeeded in introducing into the 
colonies many of the stimulating notions of his French 
acquaintances. Among those of a philosophic turn who 
had a transatlantic influence were Buffon, whose View 
of Nature fortified the American deists; Cabanis, whose 
materialism influenced Jefferson; Chastellux, who an- 
ticipated the philosophic travels of De Tocqueville ; Con- 
doreet, whose Progress of the Human Mind received an 
early printing in Maryland; Crévecceur, whose letters 
on America fascinated and misled Europeans; du Pont 
de Nemours, who projected a settlement of philosophers 
on the Mississippi; Lavoisier, whose pneumatic theory 
was used to explode the phlogistie view of Priestley in 
Pennsylvania; Quesnay, a follower of Lafayette, whose 
grandson sought to found a kind of French academy in 
Virginia; Rochefoucauld due d’Enville, who translated 
the Constitutions of the thirteen original States; Volney, 
whose Ruins, or Revolutions of Empires stirred up great 
popular interest. 
In this impressive list of those who threw in their lot 
with the struggling republic there is one that stands 
out. When Jefferson exclaimed: ‘‘ I am a materialist,’’ 
it was not so much because he had read Epicurus as be- 
cause he had heard Cabanis. While the Virginian 
was in Paris, Cabanis had delivered before the Academy 
the series of lectures on the relations between mind and 
body which contained the famous apothegms: ‘‘ the 
brain seeretes thought,”’ ‘‘ the nerves make the man.’’ 
So, on hearing the lectures of the distinguished sensa- 
tionalist, J efferson asks: Why may not the mode of action 
called thought have been given to a material organ of 
|
-P-A-G-E-107
THE FRENCH INFLUENCES 99 
  a peculiar structure, as that of magnetism is to the 
needle, or of elasticity to the spring by a particular 
manipulation of the steel? They observe that on igni- 
tion of the needle or spring, their magnetism or elas- 
ticity ceases. So on dissolution of the material organ 
by death, its action of thought may cease also, for nobody 
supposes that the magnetism or elasticity retires to 
hold a substantive and distinct existence. 
Jefferson’s sympathy with the Gallic culture was im- 
portant; indeed his mission to France was a vital im- 
pulse in his life and equally vital in the life of Southern 
thought. That sympathy was, of course, fostered by the 
political situation. The regard felt by the French for 
this country led to an intellectual entente cordiale. In 
spite of this good feeling there were some who deplored 
the presence of such effective advocates of the new natu- 
ralism as were the followers of Lafayette. These ad- 
vocates were described by the elder President Dwight of 
Yale as men of polished manners, improved minds, and 
superior address, who knew how to insinuate the gross- 
est sentiments in a delicate and inoffensive manner, 
and were at the same time friends and aids of the Ameri- 
can cause—nos trés chers et trés grands Amis, et Alliés. 
As a mirror of the Gallic mind Jefferson became a tar- 
get for the orthodox. Whenever he tried to introduce 
French literature he was invariably criticised. When 
he thought Bécourt’s Sur la Création du Monde to be 
merely an innocent attack on the Newtonian philosophy, 
he was mortified to find that certain persons contem- 
plated its censorship by the government as an offense 
against religion. In these affairs, Jefferson’s country- 
men showed themselves in a bad light; once they had 
been willing enough to receive French gold, now they 
seemed to fear the Gauls even when they were bearing
-P-A-G-E-108
  100 MATERIALISM 
gifts. What this narrow attitude led to, and how the 
Gallic invasion was checked has been pointed out. If 
French ideas had really penetrated Virginia society 
they would have become as dominant in the South as 
German ideas later became in the North; it was one of 
the difficult tasks in Southern educational history to 
dislodge French philosophy from its academic strong- 
holds in North and South Carolina; it was done by 
a strong eink of Scotch Presbyterianism proceeding 
from Princeton College southwards. And so it was that 
after all his endeavors to introduce the philosophical cul- 
ture of France, the President’s plans seem to have met 
with defeat. 
2. JosEPH PRIESTLEY, AND THE HomogENEITy or Man 
In 1794 there came to America Joseph Priestley, 
metaphysician and materialist. In the words of Jeffer- 
son, he fled from the fires and mobs of Birmingham in 
order to im a refuge in the land of free thought. His 
reputation, based on his discovery of oxygen, preceded 
him and gh his welcome. Also his particular praise 
of Franklin in his history of electricity, prejudiced 
Americans in his favor. In this history Franklinism 
was used to explain the constitution of matter. Instead 
of that coarse and impenetrable substance which it is 
generally represented to be, Priestley utilizes the con- 
ception of the American’s electrical fluid as consisting 
of particles extremely subtle, since it can permeate 
common matter. 
We have here Franklinism combined with a dynamism 
much like that of Colden’s. It is interesting to know 
how the distinguished English chemist unites these doc- 
trines in order to explain the relations of mind and 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
  JOSEPH PRIESTLEY 101 
body. His aim is to show that these apparently contra- 
dictory substances are really homogeneous. He renders 
them of like substance by performing a contrary process 
upon each. Mind he coarsens to a certain degree; matter 
he attenuates to a like degree. There is now a common 
area upon which the two substances overlap. This is 
human nature, for in man there is a meeting-point where 
the two substances are harmoniously joined. No longer 
is body that coarse and impenetrable substance which 
it is generally represented to be. No longer is mind 
that indefinite and aérated substance to which tradition 
has held. No, the two are practically consubstantial 
and one can be put in terms of the other. Indeed, the 
learned author has no objection, if his critics choose to 
call this matter by the name of spirit. Nor does he ob- 
ject if they say that he is materializing mind. His ulti- 
mate object, he contends, is to show that there is no 
real conflict between mind and matter, since one sub- 
stance may admit of the properties of both, if that 
substance be characterized by active powers and impene- 
trability. 
Such is the doctrine of anthropological materialism. 
It appeared so novel to most Americans that it was little 
appreciated and less understood. In spite of the author’s 
friendship with Franklin and with Jefferson, and in 
spite of his seeking in America a refuge for free thought, 
this Priestleyanism, as it was called, was violently at- 
tacked. For example, these three inferences were drawn 
from the supposition that the whole human constitution 
was made up of one homogeneous substance; first, that 
there is no distinction between the soul of man and the 
body; second, that the idea of the natural immortality 
of the soul is wholly fallacious; and third, that the 
properties of sensation and thought must be extinguished  
-P-A-G-E-110
102 | MATERIALISM 
  by the dissolution of the organized mass in which they 
exist. To explain the unpopularity of Priestleyanism 
we need only point out how these inferences ran counter 
to current beliefs. The first was against the dualism of 
the day. The second was against the prevalent hope 
that the soul is by nature indestructible. The third im- 
plied a belief in pantheism. Now, of these three doc- 
trines it is clear that the first two were opposed to the 
past, and tte third was an anticipation of the future. 
For their doctrine of dualism, the men of the eighteenth 
century looked back to the authority of Descartes. For 
the doctrine of natural immortality, they relied upon the 
Christian tradition. These were positive factors against 
which Priestley had to contend. Finally, the coming na- 
tive form of pantheism, the doctrine of an immanent 
world-soul, had not yet received clear expression. It 
remained for Emerson to brush away the difficulties 
that were offered by a world of apparently passive 
matter. 
Priestley’s system was carried from Pennsylvania 
into the South by his son-in-law, Thomas Cooper. In 
spite of his ingenuity, this companion of the great 
chemist had a personality which antagonized the public. 
He was attacked by the clergy when proposed by Jeffer- 
son as first professor of natural science and law in the 
University of Virginia. He was indicted in Pennsyl- 
vania for his violent writings against the Federal party. 
Finally he engaged in the nullification agitation in South 
Carolina. In short, he was a living example of his own 
doctrine of nervous irritability. He had, however, one 
advantage over Priestley in his wider knowledge of the 
literature of materialism from Blount to Broussais. 
Thereby he is able to show that Priestley’s historic 
method was as diffused and porous as that homogeneous  
-P-A-G-E-111
  
JOSEPH PRIESTLEY 103 
matter for which he contended. So, too, in his View 
of the Metaphysical and Physiological Arguments in 
Favor of Materialism he is able to state the arguments 
on both sides in a way that his older colleague could not. 
Thus, he shows that the prime argument for immaterial- 
ism is, that from matter and motion nothing but matter 
and motion can result. Hence life and the properties 
connected with it must have been originally impressed 
by that being to whom all creation is to be ascribed. 
But this statement, which favors creationism, Cooper 
cannot accept. He therefore takes up another line of 
reasoning in favor of his doctrine: The chief meta- 
physical argument is that one thing is the property 
of another because of the universality in which they 
accompany each other. Such is the necessary connection 
between the nervous system of animals and the proper- 
ties of sensation and of perception. These properties 
are inseparable, for no one can explain how the im- 
material soul can act on a material body, without hav- 
ing one property in common with it. But let the 
soul have no property in common with matter, then 
neither can act upon the other, else one might conceive 
of erecting the Coliseum of Rome by playing Haydn’s 
Rondeau. 
Cooper next turns from metaphysics to physiology. 
We need not resort, he continues, to the doctrine of 
some distinct and superadded being, such as the in- 
tellectual, sensitive, or vital soul of the ancients, since 
that would give an immortal soul to an opossum or an 
oyster. Nor need we resort to some being of analogous 
existence to the immaterial soul of the orthodox, for, if 
the seat of the soul be in the medullary substance, then 
has it all the properties of matter. On the contrary, 
all the mental phenomena are explicable as phenomena
-P-A-G-E-112
  
  104 | MATERIALISM 
of the body, or attributable to the nature of the society 
in which we are thrown. For example, a man born and 
educated in Constantinople will have one set of im- 
pressions and associations, and a man with a similar 
erent of nervous apparatus, born among the 
Quakers of Philadelphia, will have another. All this 
is the result of generating causes extraneous to the 
system. 
In this eltiinais on the external or environmental, 
Cooper strikes a fresh note, for when he says that the 
intellectual faculties vary with education and with 
habitual difference in the stimuli applied, he is approach- 
ing the coming doctrine of plasticity. This is a valuable 
addition to the doctrine of homogeneity. It brings in 
the principle of differentiation. Granted that man is of 
one substance and that there is a like nature among men, 
how are we to account for the varieties among races? 
Cooper was on the verge of the new evolutionary theories. 
What Lamarck was doing in France, he had a chance to 
do in America, but it remained for another thinker of 
South Carolina to carry out the principles of environ- 
ment to a logical conclusion. It was not Thomas Cooper 
but Joseph Leidy whom Charles Darwin acknowledged 
to have anticipated, in a measure, the principle of natu- 
ral selection. That principle, as a partial resultant of 
materialism, we shall recur to later. 
8. Bensamin Rusu, snp Menta, HeEarine 
In Dr. Benjamin Rush of Philadelphia we have the 
most notable of the American medical materialists of 
the eighteenth century. His reputation was due not so 
much to the high offices he held, such as that of physician- 
general of the Continental Army and professor of the
-P-A-G-E-113
  BENJAMIN RUSH, AND MENTAL HEALING 105 
institutes of medicine in the new University of Penn- 
sylvania, as to his anticipations of modern thought. 
As a metaphysician he is at times weak, but as a physi- 
cian he shows himself cognizant of such difficult dis- 
coveries as the cure of mental disorders by suggestion. 
He has been called the father of psychiatry in America. 
That is a true description, for his whole life was filled 
with speculations as to the practical application of 
mental medicine. These speculations began with his 
early work, the Influence of Physical Causes upon the 
Moral Faculty. At that time the mental faculty was 
considered something apart from the physical. It was 
a faculty which had a high office, as it never mingled 
with the material. Indeed, the moral sense was so 
sublimated that it was made almost unreal. It was an 
intuition, an instinct, mysterious in its movements. 
Rush changed all this. He showed that the moral 
faculty could be treated in a scientific way. It was not 
like a sensitive plant, acting without reflection; it was 
rather something subject to physical influences. This 
conception, of course, ran counter to current beliefs. It 
seemed to be a base materializing of a lofty spiritual 
principle. To meet this prejudice Rush attacks the 
problem in the form of an indirect question: Do we 
observe a connection between the intellectual faculties 
and the degrees of consistency and firmness of the brain 
in infancy and childhood? The same connection has 
been observed between the strength and the prog- 
ress of the moral faculty in children. Do we observe 
instances of a total want of memory, imagination, and 
judgment, either from an original defect in the stamina 
of the brain, or from the influence of physical causes? 
The same unnatural defect has been observed, and prob- 
ably from the same causes, of a moral faculty. A nerv- 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
106 MATERIALISM 
  ous fever may cause the loss not only of memory but 
of the habit of veracity. The former is called amnesia, 
the latter unnamed malady will compel a woman, be she 
even in easy circumstances, to fill her pocket secretly 
with bread at the table of a friend. 
In this judicious parallel drawn between the physical 
and the psychical, we see Rush’s method of approach 
upon the dark things of the mind. That these things 
were dark; that the mental operations are mysterious, 
the physician grants when he confesses that, in ventur- 
ing on this untrodden ground, he feels like ASneas when 
he was about to enter the gates of Avernus, but without 
the Sibyl to instruct him in the mysteries before him. 
In order to clear up these winding subterranean ways, 
he throws the clear light of definition on his pages. In 
the case of mental derangements he begins by making a 
definite list of the aberrations of the mind. Thus a 
weakened action of the moral faculty is called micro- 
nomia, its total absence anomia. These are technical 
terms. They are mere names. But, beside them, Rush 
offers real explanations. These aberrations, he says, 
may be caused not only by madness and hysteria, but 
also by all those states of the body which are accom- 
panied by preternatural irritability, sensibility, torpor, 
stupor, or mobility of the nervous system. It is vain, he 
continues, to attack these accompanying vices, whether of 
the body or of the mind, with lectures upon morality. 
They are only to be cured by medicine and proper treat- 
ment. Thus the young woman that lost her habit of 
veracity by a nervous fever, recovered this virtue as soon 
as her system recovered its natural tone. Furthermore, 
it makes no difference whether the physical causes that 
are to be enumerated act upon the moral faculty through 
the medium of the senses, the passions and memory, or
-P-A-G-E-115
BENJAMIN RUSH, AND MENTAL HEALING 107 
  the imagination. Their action is equally certain whether 
they act as remote, predisposing, or occasional causes. 
For instance, the state of the weather has an unfriendly 
effect upon the moral sensibility, as seen in the gloomy 
November fogs of England; so does extreme hunger, as 
in the case of the Indians of this country, who thus whet 
their appetite for that savage species of warfare pecu- 
liar to them. Again, the influence of association upon 
morals is strong. Suicide is often propagated by the 
newspapers and monstrous crimes by the publication 
of court proceedings. And as physical causes influ- 
ence moral, so do they influence religious principles. 
Religious melancholy and madness will yield more readily 
to medicine than simply to polemical discourses or casu- 
istical advice. 
A treatment such as this for moral lapses must have 
shocked the community. Discourses upon morality had 
hitherto been the cure for those lapses. So it seemed to 
degrade these advices to say that a chief influence was 
that of physical causes. Rush realized that an objection 
would be raised from his being supposed to favor the 
materiality of the soul. He meets the objection by say- 
ing that he does not see that his doctrine obliges us to 
decide upon the question of the nature of the soul. 
Still he cannot help giving his own opinion as a ma- 
terialist, and boldly states that matter is in its own 
nature as immortal as spirit. 
Rush’s well-known essay on the Influence of Physical 
Causes upon the Moral Faculty was followed in the last 
year of the century by another upon the same influ- 
ences in promoting an increase of strength and activity 
of the intellectual faculties of man. This treatise, which 
was delivered as an introductory lecture to Rush’s stu- 
dents in medicine, is a model of its kind. It is clear 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
108 MATERIALISM 
  and intelligible ; it is scientific and practical. In a happy 
analogy he helps out the undergraduate in grasping the 
mysteries of the mind. The faculties, he says, may be 
compared to a well-organized government: the memory 
and imagination to the House of Representatives, the 
understanding to the Senate, in which the transactions 
of the House of Representatives are examined, the moral 
faculties to the Courts of Justice, the conscience to the 
Court of Appeals. 
At this point the Philadelphian begins his fruitful 
study of abnormal mentality. This study is based on the 
safe doctrine of the co-ordinate value of the physical 
and psychical. Those dreams and phantasms and sup- 
posed voices which have been superstitiously ascribed 
to supernatural influences, the physician now explains 
in a natural way. For instance, unfavorable changes 
discovered in diseases in the morning are often the effect 
occasioned by the disturbing dreams of the night before, 
while the pain of a surgical operation is often lessened 
by telling the patient that the worst part of it has been 
performed. A reference like the last is remarkable 
for that day and generation. It was the principle of 
suggestive anesthesia stated some forty years before 
the application of material anesthetics in America. The 
former principle Rush had not as yet developed, for it 
was now his purpose to render the general science of 
mind a more exact science. He disparages metaphysics 
as consisting only of words without ideas, of definitions 
of nonentities. In its place he would put the stress 
upon the physical science of the mind, for which he asks 
to be allowed to coin the word phrenology. This was 
another anticipation. A decade before the word was 
used by Europeans—the American applied it to ex- 
plain dreams. For example, he stated that whatever
-P-A-G-E-117
    
BENJAMIN RUSH, AND MENTAL HEALING 109 
part of the brain is affected, the dream that takes place 
is of that nature; different parts of the brain being 
allotted to the different faculties and operations of the 
mind. Thus, if the moral part is affected, we dream of 
committing crime, at the very thought of which we 
shudder when awake. 
We shall see later how phrenology was rendered ridic- 
ulous by misuse. At this point we may only note that 
Rush used it in the sensible way of brain localization. 
His suggestions of this period were supplemented by 
more exact descriptions of mental derangements in 
some remarkable little papers on the ‘‘ Different 
Species of Phobia and Mania.’’ Among the former are 
instanced the cat-phobia, and the solo-phobia, the phobia 
being well defined as a fear of an imaginary evil, or an 
undue fear of a real one. Troubles like these may be 
cured, asserts the doctor. To compose and regulate 
the passion, there are to be found means ranging from 
the physical influence of music to the removal of painful 
associations of ideas, as when a fever, got while out 
gunning, was cured by removing the gun from the ill 
man’s room. So much for the psychical side; the physi- 
cal is now expanded in the statement that all operations 
in the mind are the effects of motions previously ex- 
cited in the brain, and every idea and thought appears 
to depend upon a motion peculiar to itself. A state- 
ment like this might almost be counted a rough formula- 
tion of the modern theory of psycho-physical parallel- 
ism. At the least, it is a practical working hypothesis, 
or, as Rush puts it, a system of principles that shall 
lead to general success in the treatment of the diseases 
of the mind. : 
This last phrase is the title of the work which gives 
to Rush his chief claim to fame. In it the American
-P-A-G-E-118
  110 MATERIALISM 
alienist seeks to discover the various causes of intel- 
lectual derangements. Briefly put, these are of two 
classes: first, those that act directly upon the body, as 
malconformations and lesions of the brain; second, those 
that act indirectly upon the body through the medium 
of the mind, as intense study over the means of dis- 
covering perpetual motion, or even researches into the 
meaning of certain biblical prophecies. Rush next takes 
up the difficult subject of the derangement of the will, 
in which subject he is declared to have led his genera- 
tion and forecasted the later work of the French school. 
At this time he was in touch with the Gallic specula- 
tions for the treatment of such a negative affection of 
the will as aboulia, or what he would call a debility or 
torpor, or loss of all sensibility to the stimulus of mo- 
tives. This disorder may be cured in two ways: From 
the physical side he has been informed by his friend 
Brissot that animal magnetism will cure like cases; 
for himself he prefers the psychical remedy, what we 
would now call mental suggestion. In fact, he actually 
anticipates the modern formula of the will to believe 
when he states, that a palsy of the limbs has been cured 
by the ery of fire, and a dread of being burned. Why, 
he asks, should not a palsy of the will be cured in a 
similar manner? There is a more subtle mental dis- 
order connected with that of the will, it is a palsy of 
the believing faculty. For this form of a weak mental di- 
gestion, Rush’s treatment is to go back to a plain in- 
tellectual diet. If the will to believe is deficient, the 
remedy should consist in putting propositions of the 
most simple nature to the mind, and after gaining assent 
to them, to rise to propositions of a more difficult nature. 
That the mind is capable of re-education is now seen 
in a negative way. Just as there are various forms of a
-P-A-G-E-119
  
BENJAMIN RUSH, AND MENTAL HEALING 111 
weak will, so are there of a weak memory. There may 
be an oblivion of names and vocables, or of the sounds 
of words, but not of the letters which compose them, of 
the qualities or numbers of the most familiar objects, 
of events, time, and place. These different varieties 
of forgetfulness are summed up in the remarkable 
case of an Italian victim of yellow fever, who, in the 
beginning of his malady spoke only English, in the 
middle only French, and on the day of his death only 
the language of his native country. And just as there is 
a discontinuous memory in fevers, so there may be a 
continuous memory in trances. Here was a hint of the 
later French discoveries that by means of subconscious 
states it is possible to patch up the lost recollections of 
the normal conscience into an unbroken secondary series. 
To Rush the best instance of this so-called dual personal- 
ity is somnambulism. Somnambulists, he asserts, recol- 
lect in each fit what they did in the preceding one. 
They appear to have two distinct minds, but he in- 
quires, may this not be owing to impressions made on 
the other parts of the brain and excited by the same 
stimulus ? 
It is unfortunate that the Philadelphia physician did 
not have an opportunity to work on such interesting 
cases as these. He complains that such abnormal experi- 
ences are commonly considered to be supernatural and 
that people are averse to having them treated in a sci- 
entific way. At that time there was little field for the 
application of Rush’s theories outside of his own private . 
patients, with a single exception. That exception re- 
ferred to what he calls his system of Christian juris- 
prudence, in which he tried to apply to public institu- 
tions like the Philadelphia jail the principles of a 
merciful mental healing. In a final passage, which
-P-A-G-E-120
  112 MATERIALISM 
anticipates by a full century the modern treatment of 
the criminal insane, Rush speaks thus feelingly : 
It would be as absurd to inflict the punishment of death upon 
a fellow creature for taking away a life under a deranged 
state of the will, as for a surgeon to cut off an arm or a 
leg because in its convulsive motions it injured a toilet or 
overset a tea table. Now, while these morbid operations of 
the will may include in their consequences even theft and 
murder, yet they are to be considered, not as vices, but as 
symptoms of a disease. Therefore, for persons thus afflicted 
legislators should abolish the punishment of death, cropping, 
branding, and public whipping, and substitute for them con- 
finement, labour, simple diet, cleanliness, and affectionate 
treatment. As is shown by the moral effects thus produced in 
the jail of Philadelphia, the reformation of criminals and the 
prevention of crimes can be better effected by living than by 
dead examples! 
It is somewhat of a problem to find out why with such 
a good foundation for mental healing in America, the 
subject was not properly developed. To obtain a solu- 
tion we shall have to make a drag-net of generaliza- 
tion. There were two schools in the country which 
were destined to have different opinions about the rela- 
tions of mind and body. Following Rush’s example, we 
find the Philadelphia school emphasizing the reciprocal 
influences of the physical and psychical. Thus, Provost 
Beasley of the University of Pennsylvania asserted that 
in every case in which there is performed an operation 
of the mind, there takes place, at the same time, a cor- 
respondent, correlative, and consentient operation of the 
body. Here was a good alliterative anticipation of the 
formula of psycho-physical parallelism, in which the 
material side of human nature is given its due. Now 
we can say that this just balance was owing to the 
influence of the English materialists Hobbes and Hart-
-P-A-G-E-121
  BENJAMIN RUSH, AND MENTAL HEALING 113 
ley, Darwin and Priestley, and the French materialists 
from Holbach to Cabanis. 
Over against the Southern followers of these material- 
ists we may put the immaterialists of New England and 
the North. These were the followers of Cudworth and 
Norris, of Berkeley and Edwards. They emphasized the 
principles of pure reason at the expense of the principles 
of physiology. They were descendants of ascetic Puri- 
tans and so attempted to live on supersensible realities. 
Moreover, Plato being their spiritual father, they sought 
to disparage the body and to cure the ills of the flesh 
by denying their real existence. They were so bent on 
cultivating the inner self, that they neglected the bodily 
self. Emerson himself said of this kind of transcen- 
dentalism, that it was the Saturnalia or excess of faith, 
wanting the restraining grace of common sense. 
From this point there stretch before us two diverging 
lines of possible development. For reasons to be ex- 
plained later, Americans did not try to strike a balance 
between these lines, but flew off on two tangents. One 
group leaned toward the materialistic side, another to the 
idealistic. Among the former were the mesmerists, the 
phrenologists, the electro-biologists. Among the latter 
were the spiritualists and so-called new thoughters. A 
rational development in the materialistic direction was 
blocked by an unfortunate revival of some crude theories 
of the olden time and the exaggerations of these theories 
in the form of animal magnetism. It will be recalled 
that old-fashioned English corporealists, like Thomas 
Hobbes, believed that the gap between mind and matter 
could be passed over by means of the animal spirits 
which were thought of as so many volatile gases in a 
retort,—subtle and invisible fluids similar to the prod- 
ucts of the alchemist’s distillation. These good old-
-P-A-G-E-122
114 | MATERIALISM 
  fashioned spirits were united with the late eighteenth- 
century notions regarding the electric fluid, and thus 
was obtained a composite elastic and electric fluid. This 
had a twofold function. As an elastic fluid it was the 
medium of communication between the individual’s 
brain and his body. As an electric fluid it could be pro- 
jected beyond the limits of the individual; thus arose 
thought-transference, clairvoyance, and mental healing, 
both local and long-distance. 
So far, we have merely an Anglo-American combina- 
tion of Hobbism and Franklinism. This was made more 
potent by being rendered occult. The French came in 
and mesmerism aided the medical theory by means of 
physical affluxes and the magnetic-sympathetic system 
of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It is strange 
how theories from different countries were united in the 
notorious movement called animal magnetism. The ball 
was started rolling in America by Franklin himself, al- 
though he came later to stop it. The invention of the 
lightning conductor stimulated the popular imagination 
by rendering the marvelous probable. Now there was 
palpable proof of the electric fluid as subtle and uni- 
versally diffused and this seemed to corroborate the 
theory of Mesmer that there was a radiation from all 
things, but especially from the stars, magnets, and hu- 
man bodies, of a force which could act in all things 
else and which was in each case directed by the indwell- 
ing spirit. This was Mesmer’s theoretical postulate. 
His practical achievement consisted in application of 
these occult doctrines in the way of psycho-therapeutics. 
He took hold of the so-called universal radiating fluid 
and applied it to the sick by means of contacts and 
passes. When he claimed that he could effect cures irre- 
spective of age, temperament, and sex, it can be seen
-P-A-G-E-123
BENJAMIN RUSH, AND MENTAL HEALING 115 
  how his practice became a scandal. At last Franklin had 
his revenge for the misuse of his scientific views. When 
the French king appointed royal commissioners to in- 
vestigate mesmerism, the name of the American am- 
bassador headed the list. That Franklin’s common sense 
was outraged by the claims of the mesmerists appears 
from the severe language of the royal report. It con- 
cluded as follows: ‘‘ The commissioners have ascertained 
that the animal magnetic fluid is not perceptible by 
any of the senses; that it has no action, either on them- 
selves or on the patients subjected to it. They are con- 
vineed that pressure and contact effect changes which 
are rarely favorable to the animal system, and which 
injuriously affect the imagination. Finally, they have 
demonstrated by decisive experiments that imagination 
apart from magnetism produces convulsions, and that 
magnetism without imagination produces nothing.’’ 
The effect of these strictures upon the fate of imma- 
terialism in America can be imagined. Franklin’s name 
carried great weight and his countrymen so trusted him 
that they did not question his criticism. In a way, it 
is an historical calamity that in this famous report the 
kernel of truth was lost in the heap of rubbish. Under- 
neath Mesmer’s talk about passes and contacts and com- 
plicated apparatus of tractors there lay the true prin- 
ciple of suggestion, namely, that through suggestion the 
subject may regain his nervous stability, relieve him- 
self of mental overtension, and so tone up the system as 
to hasten the process of cure. 
Animal magnetism, with its good and its evil, was kept 
out of the country for a full generation. It came in 
again, not by means of legitimate practitioners, but by 
means of quacks and extremists. The first of these was 
Charles Poyen, who had been ‘‘ cured mesmerically’’ of
-P-A-G-E-124
  116 MATERIALISM 
a nervous disorder, and in 1837 published his Progress 
of Animal Magnetism in New England. In the same 
year came Durant’s Exposition, or a New Theory of 
Animal Magnetism with a Key to the Mysteries. In this 
animal magnetism is declared to be a branch of elec- 
tricity, a science which gives a new life to the religious 
principle, creates a new method of pathological investi- 
gation, and settles therapeutics on a basis hitherto un- 
known to the medical world. 
Finally, there came a localized form of mesmerism, 
Dr. Grimes’s electro-biology, which started the whole 
tribe of Yankee magnetic healers. This is not the place 
to show how this exaggerated materialism was turned 
into a propaganda among the pious. It would lead toa 
long digression to explain that incredible American mix- 
ture of religion and medicine which has been noted by 
foreign observers. It is enough to say that we did not 
have the good fortune of France, where certain physi- 
cians took up the subject scientifically and developed 
out of the magical beliefs of Mesmer the real phenomena 
of hypnotism, hysteria, and suggestion. Nor have we 
time to more than suggest the direction of the other 
line of development of mental medicine. In that diverg- 
ing wedge of early tendencies the immaterialistic side, 
the line of emphasis upon the spiritual was apparently 
lost. The fact was, it was only latent, for the idealistic 
emphasis upon the primacy of mind lay dormant in 
American thought. It was last seen in the works of 
Johnson and Edwards. It did not reappear during the 
course of deism, nor that of materialism. It only came 
to life again when the warmth of the transcendental 
movement reached it. In Emerson we find a constant 
appeal to self-reliance, to the ability of the mind to 
comfort itself against the adversities of life. 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
BENJAMIN RUSH, AND MENTAL HEALING 117 
  Self-reliance and the supremacy of the spiritual— 
these two tenets of Emerson suffice to explain the re- 
vival of immaterialistic mental healing in our day. 
Just as the earlier idealism of colonial times was 
thwarted in its growth by such events as the war of in- 
dependence and the conquests of the English colonies, so 
the idealism of the nineteenth century was thwarted by 
another war, and a further conquest of the continent. 
But the longing of the native mind for the super- 
sensible; the true mystic conviction that spirit can con- 
quer matter—if that be considered as dull, dead, inert— 
that conviction never died. It has again come to life 
and we have an immaterialism of the present day with 
works which range in value from Hudson’s Laws of 
Psychic Phenomena to William James’s Energies of 
Men and the Will to Believe. 
We have left the two lines of mental healing in 
America at their widest point of divergence. On the 
one hand there was the extreme materialistic view which 
emphasized the bodily function. On the other hand, 
there is the current emphasis on the psychical. At pres- 
ent the prevailing tendency is to appeal to supernumer- 
ary powers of the mind such as the subconscious. This 
is the side taken up by the laity and one in which the 
regular medical profession takes comparatively slight 
interest. For a just development of the two sides, the 
lines must be drawn nearer together. It is desirable 
that in our medical schools we should return to the prac- 
tice of Dr. Rush of a century and a half ago, which 
means that a student should be required to study psy- 
chology in connection with physiology. This would seem 
to promise a correction of extravagances and to lead back 
to the old principle of the Philadelphia school, that there 
js a co-ordinate value in the study of mind and body.

CHAPTER V 
REALISM 
1. Tue Scortisn INFLUENCES 
/ Naruran realism, according to an early American 
exponent, consists in the doctrine that the mind per- 
ceives not merely the ideas or images of external ob- 
jects but the external objects themselves. ) In short, 
the distinguishing mark of such metaphysics is an 
appeal from the delusive principles of the idealism 
of Berkeley and the skepticism of Hume to the com- 
mon sense of mankind as a tribunal paramount to 
all the subtleties of philosophy. This is the defini- 
tion of Samuel Miller, the Princeton historian of the 
eighteenth century, in his exposition of the system of 
Reid. It may be supplemented by a defense of Presi- 
dent MeCosh, the pupil of Hamilton, two genera- 
tions later. Realism, says the latter, is that system 
which holds that there are real things and that man 
    \ can know them; that we have no need to resort to 
/ \such theories as those of internal ideas or occasional 
causes coming between the perceiving mind and the per- 
ceived objects; but that the mind knows directly and 
intuitively three kinds of reality: first, matter, whether 
the body or out of the body as external, ex- 
tended, and resisting; second, the perceiving self as 
thinking or willing, a reality as certain and definite as 
matter, but perceived by self-consciousness and not the 
external senses; third, the objects perceived by our con- 
118 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  THE SCOTTISH INFLUENCES 119 
science or moral perception, the higher knowledge of 
voluntary acts as being morally good or evil. 
Such is that natural realism which has been claimed 
to be the American philosophy. This claim is true if one 
considers realism’s rapid growth, its wide spread, and 
its tenacious hold upon the popular mind. Brought in 
as a transatlantic offshoot of the Scotch school, it over- 
ran the country, and had an exclusive and preponderant 
influence well beyond the centennial of the country’s in- 
dependence. ‘For this astonishing success several rea- 
sons have been given: not only was the common sense 
philosophy of Reid, Stewart, Brown, and Hamilton in 
harmony with the practical note of the country, but it 
was also an aid to faith, a safeguard to morality as 
against the skepticism of Hume and the atheism of the 
Voltairians. 
But there are further reasons, which may be con- 
sidered from two points of view: internally as intrinsic 
excellences; externally as adventitious aids. Looked at 
from within, natural realism is claimed to possess a 
unity not only in the circumstances that its expounders 
have been Scotchmen but also in its method, its doctrine, 
and its spirit. Its method is that of observation a and 
induction, and _not | ‘of a analysis _and_ deduction, which 
explains _ phenomena by mere » assumed _ principles. “Tts 
doctrine is that of sélf-consciousness as the instrument of 
observation, and not the mere observation of the brain 
or nerves which tends to neglect our inward experience. 
Its spirit is that_of common sense, which, by direct   
         ciples wh which - natural, original, and necessary. “We 
shall have to consider later if these points are really 
excellences. 
At first sight natural realism makes a false simplifica- 
   
-P-A-G-E-128
  120 REALISM 
tion like a child’s picture of a man, and the adult 
realist’s mind seems to work more easily than that of the 
child once portrayed by the idealist. Without looking 
further from within we must now consider the matter 
from without. Besides intrinsic excellences there were 
adventitious;aids which contributed to the success of the 
movement. | First, it happened to fit the needs of educa- 
tional and éeclesiastical orthodoxy. It was not, as in 
Scotland, favored by the union of church and state, 
but by the peculiar Am American combination of church 
and collége. “Here not only was the philosophy o: of 
) reality convenient, “compact, | “and ted hable, appealing 
amon sense of which every 
spark, but it was also an eminently safe philosophy which _ kept undergraduates locked _ in so many intel-     
  ester had some 
    
   
        Or, as the details have been given by another, Hobbes, 
because of his atomism, was considered a guide to athe- 
ism; Hume, because of his skepticism, the arch-enemy of 
orthodoxy, while Berkeley was always suspected to be a 
leader in the same direction. Therefore, to prevent the 
undermining of the faith, college professors took philos- 
ophy seriously and not speculatively, and a religious 
bias helped to determine the hold of realism in educa- 
tion. 
A second cause for the success of realism lay in the 
organizations upon | which it chanced to fasten. In its 
propaganda it. | it used most of the denominational ‘colleges 
on the Atlantic seaboard, and was also backed by the 
denominations themselves. Here the churches, like well- 
constructed machines, s, turned-out uniform sets of opin- 
ions all all fitting the same mold of ¢ ‘of common sense; to ob- 
tain_many men of one mind, the Protestant clergy of 
  he beguiling alluren ents of idealism.
-P-A-G-E-129
    
THE SCOTTISH INFLUENCES 121 
these times were practically all formed from the Scotch 
pattern, the text-books of Reid and Stewart, Beattie 
and Hamilton coming from the native press in an almost 
unbroken series of editions. A third cause of the suc- 
cess of realism was the character of the immigration 
into the country. Between the New Englanders and 
their modified Calvinism, andthe Southerners with 
their diluted Arminianism, there   
  
  here came a wave of new 
settlers, which on Touching the J American shore spread 
itself more widely than any other. The Scotch-Irish, 
entering chiefly by way of the ports of the Middle 
States, carried along with their Presbyterian connec- 
tions their philosophy of common sense. To trace this 
movement into the Alleghany Mountains and down the 
valleys of Virginia and of the Cumberland, is to trace a 
kind of intellectual glacier, an overwhelming mass of 
cold dogma which moved slowly southwards and ground 
out all opposition. This glacial age in American thought 
was of the greatest significance. Because of it deism dis- 
appeared, save in the tide-water counties where planters 
of English blood still remained, and materialism was 
wiped out, save in the Gallicized portions of the country, 
such as the Carolinas, and the Bourbon sections of Ken- 
tucky. 
That the union of church and college was a fortuitous 
aid to the spread of realism is clear from the fate of its 
rivals. Deism lacked new blood because English pioneers 
of the cultured class had ceased coming to the country. 
Idealism languished because its special means of com- 
munication, the Anglican church, was practically a chan- 
nel cut off; few scholars of Oxford and Cambridge, no 
ecclesiastic of the type of Berkeley came into the coun- 
try after the second war with England. But it was 
materialism that suffered most for want of those auxili- 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  122 REALISM 
aries under which realism flourished. As compared with 
realism the contrast is striking. Immigration did not 
help it, and sparks struck out by men like Priestley and 
Cooper were a mere flash in the pan. Nor were the 
colleges of much avail; the University of Pennsylvania 
by political mismanagement, Transylvania by its poverty 
and remoteness, and the University of Virginia by politi- 
cal complications, were together rendered inoperative as 
aids to materialism. Even if Jefferson’s late conversion 
from materialism to realism had been known, his political 
affiliations would have damaged him in the sight of the 
orthodox. Thus, by way of contrast, the elder Presi- 
dent Dwight of Yale had more weight in the scales of 
orthodox philosophy than the President of the United 
States himself; the one standing for respectable federal- 
ism, the other for infidel democracy. But the lack of 
efficient organization was the great drawback to the 
materialistic cause. Had Jefferson succeeded in found- 
ing his central society after the model of the French 
Academy, had there been anything approaching the 
Royal Society of England in the whole land, scientific 
investigations like those of Colden and of Rush might 
have received the stamp of institutional approval. 
If these are mere conjectures as to what might have 
happened, what did really happen was that materialism, 
left to itself as a mere speculative movement, practically 
disappeared from the field of thought, and that a rival 
movement which was backed up by a strong organiza- 
tion, a rigid faith, and well-trained agents, with all its 
faults, inconsistencies, contradictions, and superficiali- 
“ ties, remained as the dominant force in the field. Such 
a force was Scottish realism, which held the Atlantic 
States as a private preserve and Princeton College as 
its hunting lodge.  
-P-A-G-E-131
THE PRINCETON SCHOOL 123 
2. Tue Princeton ScHoou 
Traditionally Princeton is committed to a realistic 
metaphysics as opposed to agnosticism, materialism, or 
idealism. This is the opinion of one of its historians at 
the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the found- 
ing of the institution. The opinion is that of one who 
takes pride in an air-tight system; yet it has the advan- 
tage of summing up the early history of the college as 
it passed through successive reactions to the current 
phases of speculation. First, it was opposed to the ag- 
nosticism of extreme deism, considering the age of rea- 
son as little else but the age of infidelity; next, it was 
opposed to materialism, whether that meant a no-soul 
psychology as with Buchanan, or a reduction of psy- 
chology to a psychology of the nerves as with Cooper, 
or an identification of body and mind as with Priestley. 
Lastly, it was opposed to idealism in all its forms. In 
place of the mediate perception of Berkeley, Hume, and 
Kant, the Scotch intuition puts immediate perception, 
a direct knowledge of real qualities in things. In brief, 
the Princeton system was a-complete dualism: in its 
cosmology, between the world and deity; in its psy- 
chology, between soul and body; in its epistemology, 
between subject and object. 
The advantage of such a dualism was the avoidance 
of the difficulty of trying to think things together. Now 
this accommodation of its teaching to the general in- 
telligence led realists like McCosh to claim that such 
a natural realism as was taught at Princeton was what 
an American philosophy should be. The claim may be 
disputed, yet it has in its favor the fact that the College 
of New Jersey, from its very foundation, had impressed 
upon it a national character, inasmuch as it was not the
-P-A-G-E-132
    124 REALISM 
college of an established church, nor of a single colony, 
nor of a people sprung from a single nationality, but 
had for its charter an undenominational document, for 
its heads graduates of Harvard and Yale, Glasgow 
and Edinburgh, and for its students the sons of Eng- 
lish Friends, New England Puritans, and Presbyterians 
from Scotland and Ireland. But although in this con- 
nection it be granted that Princeton was the freest col- 
lege in the country in its beginnings, it was hardly so 
in its development. <A fatal polemic spirit seized hold 
of it, and as the institution passed through three external 
stages, corresponding to the three speculative movements 
of the age, it grew more and more restricted and unre- 
ceptive. 
During the Revolutionary War Nassau Hall was a 
refuge for the military, but not for the intellectuals; 
it received Washington and his forces, but shut out 
the stray followers of Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Hartley, 
and Darwin. In a word, the college which had been a 
defense of the faith against the attacks of the deists 
became what one of the defenders of natural realism 
has called a bulwark of impregnable truth before which 
all forms of error and irreligion must give way. To 
explain this state of affairs a parallel may be drawn. 
As Princeton, situated on the highway between New 
York and Philadelphia, was a critical battleground be- 
tween the British and the Americans, so it became a 
position of strategic importance between the idealists 
of the North and the materialists of the South. But 
in the latter case, the victory over the opposing forces 
was gained only at considerable expense, the loss of a 
certain spirit of liberality, due to the replacement of 
speculation by dogma, of philosophy by theology. Start- 
ing as a non-ecclesiastical body, formed by the broader
-P-A-G-E-133
  THE PRINCETON SCHOOL 125 
men of the synod of New York, a Presbyterian form 
of belief came in with Witherspoon, increased with 
Stanhope Smith, until with the appearance of Ashbel 
Green in 1812, the theological seminary so dominated the 
college, that the two were persistently identified up 
to the very sesquicentennial of the University. 
All this may serve to explain the Princetonian claim 
that it was the Scottish-American realism, and not New 
England transcendentalism, that was to be considered, 
in largest measure, the peculiar philosophy of the coun- 
try. Nevertheless, for the settling of these alternatives, 
one might ask which of the two systems better fulfilled 
the criteria of native origin, of progressiveness, of lib- 
erality of spirit, and of toleration of other forms of 
thought. The question is a large one and answerable only 
after one has gained the proper historical data, data 
which are in turn furnished only by a consideration of 
the personal representatives of natural realism. 
In its early days Nassau Hall went through a period 
of unthinking placidity. But with the advent of Presi- 
dent Witherspoon in 1768, the philosophical situation 
became as agitated as was the political, for now Eng- 
lish deism vanished, an American form of idealism was 
driven forth, and Scotch realism became the official sys- 
tem of the place. In short, the era of deduction and 
design was succeeded by the era of induction and com- 
mon sense, or as the new college head phrased the matter 
—it is safer in our reasonings to trace facts upwards than 
to reason downwards. 
The accounts of the personality of Witherspoon vary. 
A recent biographer describes him as a man of extraor- 
dinary force, versatility, and charm; eminent as a 
teacher, preacher, politician, law-maker, and philosopher, 
and with the exception of Washington, as having more
-P-A-G-E-134
  126 REALISM | 
of the quality called presence than, perhaps, any other 
man of his time in America. On the other hand, 
Thomas Carlyle said that he was of a disagreeable 
temper; Jonathan Odell satirized him as ‘‘ fierce as the 
fiercest, foremost of the first ’’; John Adams declared 
him clear but a little heavy in his speech; and President 
Stiles of Yale shrewdly remarked that while the doc- 
tor was of a reasoning make, his philosophical learning 
was not great. In truth Witherspoon was a man of 
action rather than reflection. As a further hindrance to 
free speculation he had entered the country with his 
mind somewhat rigidly made up, and at the age of five- 
and-forty possessed ideas more conservative than those of 
his predecessors. The former heads of the college, 
graduates of Harvard and Yale, had been open to the 
influences of the earlier optimistic deism; they had 
argued in favor of this being the best possible world; 
they had looked on the workings of nature with such 
admiring eyes as to be well-nigh ready to grant it self- 
sufficiency. ( But to the lineal descendant of John Knox 
the external world bore a different aspect; in itself it 
was far from being perfect or self-sufficient; rather it 
was a created thing, a limited thing, a thing full of 
defects. 
Moreover, for those who have great charity for athe- 
ists and deists, Witherspoon draws up, in obvious parody 
of the Anglicans, what he denominates his Athenian 
Creed: 
I believe in the beauty and comely proportions of Dame 
Nature, and in almighty Fate, her parent and guardian... . 
I believe that the universe is a huge machine, wound up from 
everlasting by necessity, and consisting of an infinite number 
of links and chains, each in a progressive motion towards the 
zenith of perfection and meridian of glory; that I myself am
-P-A-G-E-135
  THE PRINCETON SCHOOL 127 
a little glorious piece of clockwork, a wheel within a wheel, 
or rather a pendulum in this grand machine swinging hither 
and thither by the different impulses of fate and destiny; that 
my soul (if I have any) is an imperceptible bundle of exceed- 
ing minute corpuscles, much smaller than the smallest Hol- 
land sand. . . . I believe that there is no ill in the universe, 
nor any such thing as virtue, absolutely considered; that these 
things, vulgarly called sins, are only errors in judgment, and 
foils to set off the beauty of nature, or patches to adorn her 
face. 
Harassed by the host of enemies raised by this 
anonymous satire of his, Witherspoon accepted the re- 
peated offer of the presidency of the New Jersey Col- 
lege, which was pressed upon him by Benjamin Rush, 
then a student of medicine at Edinburgh, and journeyed 
to America, where he was received as if he were the very 
prince after whom the college was named. But his 
duties at Princeton were not easy. In teaching alone, in 
addition to a course in moral philosophy, he included 
lectures to the juniors and seniors upon chronology and 
history, composition and criticism, Hebrew and French. 
Then, too, speculative troubles stared him in the face; 
on his arrival he found that the Irish idealism had 
obtained a footing in the locality. According to the 
later account of President Ashbel Green, the Berkeleian 
system of metaphysics was in repute in the college when 
Witherspoon entered. The tutors were zealous believers 
in it and waited for the president with some expectation 
of either confounding him or making him a proselyte. 
They had mistaken their man. He first reasoned against 
the system, and then ridiculed it till he drove it out of 
the college. The writer has heard him state that before 
Reid or any other author of their views had published 
any theory on the ideal system, he wrote against it, and 
suggested the same trains of thought which they adopted, 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
128 REALISM 
  and that he published his essay in a Scotch \ cage. 
This essay has at last been discovered, yet an extract 
from it will show that it was but a dubious refutation 
of Berkeleianism. According to Witherspoon we never 
hear of a deceitful sound, a deceitful smell, or a de- 
ceitful taste; but only, that the objects we see are not 
in all respects the same as we may imagine them upon 
the first inspection. A square tower at a distance ap- 
pears to be round; the body of the sun seems to have 
but two feet diameter; objects in the same line, though 
at different distances, appear to be contiguous; what does 
this imply, more than that an accurate discovery of the 
bulk, figure, and distance of bodies, cannot, and was 
never intended to be made from sight alone? It is very 
probable, from the manner in which children view ob- 
jects at first, that they appear to them all in a plain, or 
rather that the image makes a sensible impression on 
the retina of the eye, that it is by experience they learn 
to place them at different distances, and by the connec- 
tion of ideas that they have an immediate perception of 
the distance when the image strikes them. Perhaps it 
may be objected, that color, which is allowed to be the 
proper object of sight, and of sight alone, is not in the 
object, and yet is supposed in it. I answer, it is as 
much in the object as other secondary qualities are. The 
object hath not our sensation, but a power to produce it; 
and there is a real difference in the object to make it of 
a different color, viz., a peculiar disposition of its parts 
to reflect only rays of such or such a kind. Upon the 
whole, it is nothing else, but the very excellence of the 
sense of sight, or its great serviceableness to us in 
more respects than its immediate office, that gives oc- 
casion or any plausibility to its being charged with 
delusion,
-P-A-G-E-137
THE PRINCETON SCHOOL 129 
‘All that the critic offers in support of this strange 
compound opinion, is an argument from analogy, that 
there are delusive or deceitful perceptions conveyed to 
us by our senses in the natural world, that the representa- 
tions of objects and their qualities differ from what 
philosophy discovers them to be. Of this he gives one 
particular instance, from the objects of sight, that a sur- 
face appears smooth and uniform, whereas it is rough 
and uneven when examined with a microscope. He then 
observes in general, that it is now universally admitted, 
that the qualities called secondary which we by natural 
instinct attribute to matter, belong not to matter, nor 
exist really without us; that color is not in the object, 
etc. Now, an analogical argument cannot be more ef- 
fectually destroyed than by showing the falsehood of the 
fact upon which it is founded. ‘‘ I affirm, therefore,’’ 
concludes Witherspoon, ‘‘ that the observation he makes, 
and takes for granted, is not just; but that the ideas we 
receive by our senses, and the persuasions we derive im- 
mediately from them, are exactly according to truth, to 
real truth, which certainly ought to be the same with 
philosophic truth.’’ 
We shall return to Witherspoon’s fight against the 
American form of idealism. Meanwhile in his Lectures 
on Moral Philosophy he had the distinction of being the 
first college head in the country to set forth in his class- 
room a definite system of ethics. \ This system, as Lansing 
Collins, the editor of the recent reprint of the Lectures, 
has said, was the realism of Thomas Reid and the Scot- 
tish common-sense school, a philosophy not unknown in 
Princeton before Witherspoon came, and one which by 
the labors of the next twenty-five years he was to firmly 
intrench in the congenial soil of the New World. To 
prove the Scotch school right Witherspoon would prove
-P-A-G-E-138
  130 REALISM 
that the other schools are wrong. He explains that in 
opposition to such infidel writers as David Hume, who 
sought to shake the certainty of our belief upon cause 
and effect, upon personal identity, and the idea of 
power, some writers have advanced, with great apparent 
reason, that there are certain first principles or dictates 
of common sense, which are either first principles, or 
principles seen with intuitive evidence. These are the 
foundations of all reasoning, and without them to reason 
is a word without a meaning. They can no more be 
proved than you can prove an axiom in mathematical 
science. These authors of Scotland have lately pro- 
duced and supported this opinion, to resolve at once all 
the refinements and metaphysical objections of some in- 
fidel writers. 
¥ Witherspoon’s method of attack sheds light on the 
most interesting philosophical event of his administra- 
tion at the College of New Jersey. That event was his 
successful attack on idealism.) A single tutor, Joseph 
Periam, had been the unhappy vehicle for the Berkeleian 
metaphysics, and Stanhope Smith, the president’s own 
son-in-law and successor in office, had become infected 
with the taint of what was described as that impious 
skepticism which wholly denies the existence of matter. 
According to one version, Periam, soon after his gradua- 
tion in 1762, embraced the bishop’s theory denying the 
existence of the material universe, and Smith, who was 
intimate with him, was thereby in great danger of mak- 
ing shipwreck of his religious principles. Of the precise 
manner in which immaterialism was introduced into 
Nassau Hall we have no record. It is very unlikely that 
Samuel Johnson’s Berkeleian Elements of Philosophy 
was used there, as it was in the Philadelphia Academy, 
for Johnson, as head of the Episcopalian King’s College
-P-A-G-E-139
THE PRINCETON SCHOOL 131 
in New York, had called the rival Presbyterian College 
of New Jersey a fountain of nonsense. 
Nor did the other colonial idealist leave behind him 
any trace of his peculiar mystical theory of knowledge. 
Jonathan Edwards lived too short a time as president 
of Princeton to affect the college directly. So we are 
forced to seek a roundabout way by which idealism may 
have filtered in. There is record of one Ebenezer Brad- 
ford, a Connecticut student and a subsequent advocate of 
the Northern immaterialism, who wrote to Dr. Bellamy, 
one of the later Edwardeans, the following ingenuous 
tale: ‘‘ Dr. Witherspoon was a great enemy to what they 
call the Eastward or New Divinity, which was so much 
exploded by all in college that when I came here I 
was advised by a particular friend not to let my senti- 
ments be known by any means, alleging it would be of 
great disservice to me. I found two or three, however, 
who dared to think for themselves, and we agreed to 
promote what we judged to be truth in as private and 
hidden manner as possible. We ventured to read some 
of your books with the title pages cut out, which were 
much admired by those who professed themselves ene- 
mies to the New Divinity.’’ 
By whatever devious path idealism worked its way into 
Princeton, it is tolerably clear, from this naive account, 
that Witherspoon was a high conservative, preferring 
above all things what the narrator terms ‘‘ notions which 
appear greatly confined.’’ The result of this bias was 
practically seen in the career of Periam, who, from 
being a ‘‘ very ingenious young man,’’ became ‘‘ a very 
serious man.’’ But before this change of mind had 
occurred, Princeton’s earliest idealist had infiuenced a 
person of much greater importance than himself. 
Samuel Stanhope Smith, the son of an Irish Presby-

terian divine, and in turn student, tutor, professor of 
moral philosophy, and president, coming to the college 
at the age of sixteen, before President-Elect Wither- 
spoon had arrived from Scotland, was consigned more 
especially to the care of tutor Periam. Now, Periam, 
continues Smith’s biographer, had not confined himself 
to the study of mathematics, but had extended his in- 
quiries to metaphysics also, and become infected with 
the fanciful doctrine of Bishop Berkeley, which con- 
sists, as is generally known, in denying the existence of 
a material universe, and converting every object of the 
senses into a train of fugitive perceptions. How this 
professor, who had been habituated to the hardy pur- 
suits of mathematical science and the inductive philos- 
ophy, could ever have brought himself to embrace such 
a visionary theory, a theory so repugnant to common 
sense, and rather an object of ridicule than of serious 
consideration, it is difficult to explain, unless it be upon 
the principle that, having been accustomed to require 
the most conclusive proof of everything before he as- 
sented to its truth, he so far misconceived the subject as 
to imagine that he must have arguments drawn from 
reason, to convince him of the existence of an exterior 
world, before he would admit the reality of it; and this 
surely is an evidence which Nature would. deny him, 
as she rests the proof of it solely and entirely upon 
the simple testimony of the senses. However this may 
have been, Periam had address and ingenuity enough to 
infuse the principles of the Bishop of Cloyne into the 
mind of Smith, and he began seriously to doubt whether 
there were in the world such real existences as the sun, 
moon, and stars; rivers, mountains, and human beings. 
In this ponderous account we catch the unsympathetic 
tone of realism toward idealism. To convert the pervert 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
  
THE PRINCETON SCHOOL 133 
back to the true faith the method of vilification is now 
used. The account runs how, upon the arrival of Dr. 
Witherspoon, the poor undergraduate, captivated by the 
specious fallacies of the Bishop of Cloyne, held in 
bondage by the silken chains of a fantastic theory, was 
conducted out of the dark labyrinth into which he had 
been betrayed, and from the cloudy speculations of im- 
materialism brought back to the clear light of common 
sense. 
Stanhope Smith being the first graduate of the college 
to become its head, Princeton was now subject to a sort 
of intellectual inbreeding. By this the strain of realism 
tended to become fixed. This is discovered in the writ- 
ings of the next representative of the Princeton school. 
In his Retrospect of the Eighteenth Century, Samuel 
Miller informs his readers that the writers of the 
common-sense school have contributed the most impor- 
tant accessions which the philosophy of mind has re- 
ceived since the time of Locke. Their first service was 
to cease the senseless prattling about occult terms; their 
next in observing the skeptical conclusions which Berke- 
ley had drawn from the old theory of perception when 
he contended that all the varied beauties of creation 
which we behold are nothing more than fancy or 
images impressed on the mind. 
V Here is a triple misinterpretation. It was not the 
realists but the immaterialists who earliest attacked oc- 
cult terms such as material ‘‘ substance.’’ Again, 
Berkeley did not use the old theory of perception, but 
put in its place a new theory of vision. Finally, the 
good bishop did not draw skeptical conclusions in mak- 
ing what are usually called material objects ‘‘ mere 
fancies, and not in accordance with the lawful language 
of signs ’’; rather did he teach a spiritual realism, in  
-P-A-G-E-142
134 REALISM 
which the objects of sense are so many alluring words 
of a divine visual language. 
Miller’s Retrospect was called in irony the funeral 
discourse of the eighteenth century. From this it might 
easily be inferred what system he would next consign 
to the philosophic potter’s field. It was materialism. 
Its principles he supposes many superficial thinkers 
have been seduced into adopting by the plausible aspect 
which it wears. Its object is to reduce all the energies 
of intellectual and animal life to the operation of an in- 
visible fluid secreted by the brain, and existing in every 
part of the body. But does this fluid exist? If so, it 
explains nothing; the whole business of causation is as 
much in the dark as ever, even after all the parade of 
development through contractions, fibrous motions, and 
appetencies. Indeed, the sensorial power, as applied to 
explain the phenomena of mind, too much resembles the 
occult qualities, the phantasms, and the essential forms 
of the schoolmen; for when using the word idea some- 
times to signify the fibrous motion and sometimes the 
sensorial, it signifies both the cause and the effect. 
This is unjust. Most of the materialists in the land 
did not pretend to explain the nature of causation, but 
only to describe things caused. All they claimed was that 
nervous contractions and fibrous motions were not the 
efficients but merely the occasions of the accompanying 
mental phenomena. They only stated that the physical 
and the psychical occurred side by side and thus an- 
ticipated, in large measure, the modern doctrine of 
parallelism. But Miller cannot see the new trail which 
was destined to open the way for the future experimental 
psychology. Instead he concludes his work with the 
pessimistic remark that if the physical sciences have 
received great improvement during the century under   
 
-P-A-G-E-143
    
THE LESSER REALISTS 135 
consideration, it is feared that the same cannot with 
truth be said respecting the science of the human mind; 
in this wide field, new experiences and discoveries, in 
the proper sense of the word, can have no place. By 
such a denial the Princeton historian went far to im- 
pair the claim that realism was to be the coming philos- 
ophy of America, for such a denial ran counter to the 
inventive genius of his countrymen, cast reflections on 
such psychological experiments as were framed by Rush, 
and perhaps thereby prevented the rise of a school of 
experimentalists among such Princetonians, for example, 
as the electrician Joseph Henry. But fancies aside, the 
facts are that the spirit of common sense left little to 
the imagination, desired no novel inventions, but pre- 
ferred to keep its adherents revolving in the treadmill 
of traditional thought. In fine, the policy of the New 
Jersey College was to turn out safe minds content to 
mark time in the old way. 
3. Tue Lesser REALISts 
With the lesser realists we foresee the breaking up 
of the old system. Thus Frederick Beasley recalled 
how in the College of Princeton the fanciful theory of 
Bishop Berkeley, as a kind of philosophical day-dream, 
was superseded by the Scottish school, but that these 
men had done their predecessors very great injustice. 
Against these misinterpreters Beasley now proceeds 
to raise against his adversaries what he calls the literary 
tomahawk. He does this with such cruel effect as to 
lay bare the skulls of his enemies and to discover to 
the world brain capacities not so large as had been pre- 
sumed. The propensity of the Scots, he exclaims, is to 
eavil at the doctrines of preceding philosophers, espe-
-P-A-G-E-144
  136 REALISM 
cially Berkeley’s new theory of vision and his theory 
of the visual language. Yet these two theories may be 
upheld by two conerete cases. There is the case of a 
woman in Pennsylvania who, having cataracts removed 
from both her eyes, declared that her sensations were 
indescribably delightful, but, at the same time, her newly 
recovered power of vision was for some time of very 
little use to her; she was perpetually stretching out her 
hands for fear of running against objects, being unable 
to distinguish their distances or magnitudes. Again he 
illustrates the justness of the observation, that in all 
our acquired perceptions we proceed according to the 
interpretation of signs, and whenever the sign of any- 
thing is presented, the mind naturally concludes that 
the thing signified is present. A gentleman passing 
along the streets of Philadelphia imagines that he per- 
ceives a steamboat in the Delaware at a distance, but 
upon approaching it, finds that he was deceived, for 
that the object he saw was a sign-post before an inn, 
upon which the representation of a steamboat was rudely 
painted. 
We have here the subjective principle of interpre- 
tation brought against the Scottish common sense with 
its absolute and universal principles. Another instance 
of a similar sort is found in the doctrine of relativity, 
of a personal as against a public standard, as pro- 
pounded by another of the lesser realists, Charles Nis- 
bet. He explains that the old saying of Heracleitus— 
that a man cannot go into the same river twice—applies 
to the mental life. Every person may be said to have a 
certain relative measure of that which is peculiar to him- 
self and suited to his own feelings, so that a lecture in 
philosophy may seem as long as a game of cards, though 
the latter be actually three times longer. Nevertheless,
-P-A-G-E-145
  THE LESSER REALISTS 137 
when we are attentive to our own thoughts we discover 
a sort of pomp or procession of ideas which succeed one 
another in our minds with a regular pace or march, and 
this regularity could not exist unless we had a common 
measure without ourselves, a means whereby mankind 
can agree with each other with respect to the length of 
determinate things. 
We could multiply instances of the lesser lights who 
discovered breaks in the system of common sense, but 
such men were not wanted and remained ignored. So 
it is that in reviewing the triumphant course of natural 
realism we get the illusion of unbroken ranks of be- 
lievers, from the early Princeton leaders to the later 
Northern representatives. Throughout there was ap- 
parent agreement, from the official heads in the colleges 
to the popular exponents who held that Reid had said 
the last safe word in philosophy and that Kant opened 
up the abysses of skepticism. 
With the rise of New England transcendentalism there 
came a life and death struggle between the old and the 
new. We have previously raised the question which 
system was destined to be the American philosophy. We 
can now suggest an answer. Which of the two forms of 
thought best fulfilled the requisite of native origin, of 
progressiveness, of liberality of spirit, and of toleration 
of other forms of thought? In regard to natural real- 
ism, it may be said that as it was foreign in its origin, so 
it remained an exotic in its characteristics, lacking those 
qualities on which the men of the New World prided 
themselves. First, it was unprogressive, being rightly 
accused of failure to advance; thus the two principal 
definitions of the movement, although seventy years 
apart, were in substance essentially the same. Again, it 
was illiberal towards unrestrained inquiry; being op- 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
    138 REALISM 
posed to the speculative ferment of Hume and the free 
critical methods of Kant, it was rationalistic, but only 
within the limits fixed by respectability. Lastly, it was 
intolerant of other systems; as it fought the European 
forms of deism, idealism, and naturalism of the eight- 
eenth century, so it came to look askance upon the French 
positivism, the German idealism, and the British evolu- 
tionary doctrines of the nineteenth. These are the 
shortcomings of realism, but, inasmuch as its aim was to 
be a safe and sound philosophy, they are to be con- 
sidered not as fundamental deficiencies but only as the 
defects of its qualities. In marked contrast, however, 
to the Scottish realism was the New England tran- 
scendentalism, whose characteristics were the direct op- 
posite of its chief rival. Instead of being a foreign 
importation brought over in the original form, it was 
essentially a native growth deeply rooted in its age and 
surroundings. Historie forces were visible in it, but 
these had been so assimilated that they appeared not so 
much initial impulses as remote resultants. Hence 
transcendentalism possessed the typical marks of the 
receptive American mind. First it was progressive; 
starting with the Platonism latent in Puritanism, it 
drew nourishment in turn from the Berkeleian, Kantian, 
and Hegelian idealism. Again it was liberal; instead 
of opposing the spirit of free inquiry, it exhibited a 
generous interest in regard to other systems, translat- 
ing not merely the philosophical classics of France and 
Germany but, as in the case of Emerson, seeking in- 
spiration from the sacred books of the East. This 
lenient attitude towards an unrestricted immigration of 
foreign thought brought about the last and most obvious 
characteristic of transcendentalism, its utter tolerance 
of other systems. Thus it took from the Puritans their
-P-A-G-E-147
THE LESSER REALISTS 139 
individualism, from the deists their arguments for 
design, from the idealists their phenomenalism, from the 
materialists their dynamic conception of the universe, 
from the realists themselves their doctrine of immediate 
intuition. This may be considered such an extreme 
eclecticism as not to deserve the name of a system; it may 
nevertheless be said in conclusion that whether or not 
transcendentalism was the coming philosophy of Amer- 
ica, it at least furnished a native epitome of American 
philosophy as it was developed in its early schools.

  CHAPTER VI 
TRANSCENDENTALISM 
1. Emerson, INTERPRETER OF NATURE 
THERE is an inscription on an old wall of Revolution- 
ary days, that, ruined by the war, it was rebuilt mere 
strongly out of the old materials. This, in a figure, ex- 
plains the beginnings of transcendentalism in America. 
After the dark and sterile period in our philosophy, the 
movement in New England suddenly gathered up the 
forces of the previous times. Transcendentalism summed 
up in itself the marks of all three centuries,—the faith 
of the seventeenth, the reason of the eighteenth, the 
feeling of the nineteenth. As we may recall, the age of 
unreason, or dependency on inscrutable decrees, had been 
succeeded by that of reason, or the power of man fully 
to understand nature, and that in turn by the age of 
sentiment,—the outpouring of the romantic spirit. It 
remained for one man to fuse these three factors into a 
system. Emerson believed in faith in self, or self- 
reliance; he believed in reason in nature, for nature 
was the present expositor of the divine mind; he be- 
lieved in feeling toward his fellow-men, for he looked 
on man as a ae of a temple, ‘‘ wherein all wisdom 
and all good abide.’ 
This fusion of the spirit of three centuries brought 
a new note into philosophy. No longer was man alone 
worshiped as admirable; no longer was nature consid- 
ered as self-sufficient, but the two were counted com- 
140
-P-A-G-E-149
EMERSON, INTERPRETER OF NATURE 141 
plementary. Therefore transcendentalism may be looked 
at from a double aspect; practically, as an assertion of 
the inalienable worth of man; theoretically, as an asser- 
tion of the immanence of the divinity, not only in nature, 
but in human nature: ‘‘ There is one mind, and all the 
powers and privileges which lie in any lie in all.’’ 
‘Whence arose this more ardent interpretation? How 
were the old ideas transfused by emotion? How was 
it that the worship of nature and of human nature 
were thus intimately conjoined? The answer may be put 
in a word. These changes are due to a reaction, a re- 
vulsion against intellect as the sole source of truth. 
Sensibility and will now demanded their share. Men 
wanted to be warmed, to be inspired to do something. 
For these positive needs there had been a long negative 
preparation. That the Northern transcendentalism was 
such a close union of thought and feeling was due to 
the fact that for two centuries New England had been 
emotionally starved. The echoes of the Elizabethan age 
had long since died away. The fervor and color of a 
richer civilization had disappeared. In philosophy, no 
system between 1600 and 1800-had offered a satisfac- 
tory blending. There were three alternatives, no one 
of which was adequate: Calvinism had degenerated 
into superstition; deism, with the cold, dry light of 
reason, had killed enthusiasm; realism had brought all 
down to the common level of common sense. 
At the beginning of the new century, then, there was 
a felt need for a larger life; the most thoughtful had 
been so long frozen in their feelings that they waited 
eagerly for warmer currents of thought. The younger 
generation in college had to find emotional stimulus out- 
side of the curriculum. The change that came about 
was, briefly, a return to nature, The rationalism of that 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  142 TRANSCENDENTALISM 
day was like a formal English garden with its straight 
walks and clipped hedges. “Lranscendentalism was 
like the American. fields. and-forests with their broad 
acres and their tangled wildernesses. A new race of 
thinkers thus arises. \The closet philosopher is suc- 
ceeded by the transcendental traveler, ever in the air 
and face to face with the sun. He is willing to wander 
far in search of spiritual nourishment; he seeks for 
the fruits of nature by his own efforts and thereby en- 
genders an appetite for those fruits.“ Thus comes the 
keenness of the younger spirits in the new movement. 
They are eager to transcend the trammels of society, to 
go apart by themselves, to live in the woods, in order to 
penetrate the secrets of nature, to learn the mind of 
outdoors. 
Having considered the negative preparation of previ- 
ous movements and the positive incitements of the coun- 
try that lay about them, we may take up the funda- 
mental beliefs of New England transcendentalists. The 
first of their beliefs was-monism, which meant not only 
the unity of the world in’ God, but the immanence of 
God in the world. On the one hand, nature is the ex- 
positor of the divine mind; on the other, man is the soul 
of the whole, of the Eternal One. <A second belief is 
that of the microcosm,—because of the indwelling of 
divinity, every part of the world, however small, is held 
to contain within itself all the laws and meaning of the 
universe :—Man is conscious of a universal soul within 
his individual life, he is an analogist and studies rela- 
tions in all objects; placed in the center of beings, a ray 
of relation passes from every other being to him. A third 
belief is that of the macrocosm, which holds that the soul 
of each individual is identical with the soul of the world 
and contains latently all which it contains:—Man is a
-P-A-G-E-151
EMERSON, INTERPRETER OF NATURE 143 
universal mirror; every rational creature is entitled to 
partake of the soul of the world by his constitution. A 
final belief is that of symbolism. The transcendentalist 
holds that, nature is the embodiment of spirit in the 
world of sense; nature is a great picture to be appre- 
ciated, a great book to be read) As Emerson expresses 
it, there is radical correspondence between visible things 
and human thoughts. ... What was it that nature 
would say? Was there no meaning in the live repose 
of the valley behind the mill? The leafless trees and 
every withered stem and stubble, rimed with frost, con- 
tributed something to the mute music. . . . This is the 
symbolism through which the poetic pantheist finds a 
higher use in the study of nature. Nature, he ever in- 
sists, is the incarnation, not only of the true and beauti- 
ful, but of the good. Through it, the individual comes 
in contact with the very spirit and being of God... . 
Taking the old figure, that the visible world and the 
relation of its parts is the dial plate of the invisible, he 
adds that the universe becomes transparent and the light 
of higher laws than its own shines through it. 
It is in his love of nature and in his ability to read 
the meaning of its symbols that Emerson showed him- 
self a native representative of the romantic movement. 
Fond of the fields and a wanderer in the woods, he had 
known nature in all its moods, and had learned the feel- 
ing of kinship between man and the world in which he 
lives. Indeed his first written confession was that in 
the wilderness there is something dear and connate. 
Words such as these furnish the prime bond of connec- 
tion between native thought and that of Europe. In 
holding that nature and human nature are akin, Emer- 
son is in harmony with the English romantic movement 
of his day. In reading Wordsworth he declares that
-P-A-G-E-152
  144 TRANSCENDENTALISM 
The Excursion awakens in every lover of nature the right 
feeling. We saw stars shine, we felt the awe of moun- 
tains, we heard the rustle of wind in the grass, and 
knew again the ineffable secret of solitude. . . . Does 
a declaration of this sort mean that the American was 
unoriginal? Such a conclusion can hardly be drawn 
from the passage, for Emerson speaks as one who al- 
ready had experienced the feelings of a lover of nature, 
already known its ineffable secret. We may, therefore, 
hold that the early New England transcendentalists 
were of like spirit with Wordsworth and Coleridge, but 
did not use them so much for authorities, as for corrobo- 
rators of their kindred beliefs. They did not borrow, 
they sympathized, and that because they had already 
been under common influences. 
Of these influences the earliest had been the French. 
In America as in England the turmoil of the great 
revolution had stirred men’s minds, for the mental un- 
rest which followed was an outgrowth of the old liberty 
of philosophizing. Upon the ancient stock of English 
independency there was grafted the vigorous branch 
of French liberty. In New England there had been 
an unbroken expression of the rights of individual judg- 
ment. Those Independents who came from the eastern 
counties of England, once settled by the roving Danes, 
held that every man had a full right to his own beliefs. 
But more fervent expressions of these beliefs and their 
junction with the emotions of the heart now took a 
French form. The spirit of liberty was English, but 
warmth and ardor were brought to the cool Anglo- 
American by his Gallic brothers. The rights of man 
were no longer to be expressed merely in public docu- 
ments, in measured terms, but each man was to follow 
his own private inclinations, to break down the trammels
-P-A-G-E-153
  EMERSON, INTERPRETER OF NATURE 145 
of society, to rely upon himself. Seldom before had in- 
dividualism reached such heights. Indeed by a sort of 
paradox it led to a degree of detachment that was at 
times indifference. The transcendentalist had so freed 
himself from tradition that he at once broke from sec- 
tarianism. 
In the case of Emerson, the break came first in re- 
ligion. As an individualist, he felt a lack of interest 
in the dogma of his denomination. He publicly ex- 
pressed his opinion, that the Christian scheme no longer 
interested him. In the words of aw English critic, he 
left his church with a yawn. 
The refusal to be tied by tradition may also be laid 
to the influence of developed deism. Non-sectarianism 
was an heritage of the old belief that all religions are 
but parts of one great religion, the religion of nature. 
It made no difference to the transcendentalist whence 
he drew his inspiration, provided there was inspiration. 
A marked aspect of our day, observed Bronson Alcott, 
is its recovery and recognition of past times and great 
names. The same thought was expressed by Emerson, 
in an early number of the Dial, when he asserted: 
‘We have every day occasion to remark transcendental- 
ism’s perfect identity, under whatever new phraseology 
or application to new facts, with the liberal thought of 
all men of a religious and contemplative habit in other 
times and countries. 
The transcendentalist as a cosmopolite is a strange 
figure. He has been commonly represented as priding 
himself on being a point around which all thought re- 
volves, and has led the scornful to infer from this, that 
he was a vanishing point. But his conceit was really 
not based upon mere egotism, but upon a broad knowl- 
edge and a remarkable range of reading. It is seldom
-P-A-G-E-154
  146 TRANSCENDENTALISM 
remembered that by the time Emerson published his 
first volume, Nature, in 1836, he had traveled in Eu- 
rope; had known many cities and many men, and had 
read widely of other days and other climes. He had 
been considered an eclectic philosopher; he should rather 
be called an ethnic philosopher. He casually puts Jesus 
and Socrates on the same level and then goes on to quote 
Coleridge and Spinoza, Plato and Plotinus, Zoroaster 
and the Hindoos, and ends with the quiet assertion: 
** All goes back to the East.’’ 
There are already sufficient factors noted to account 
for the philosophy of Emerson, not only in its matter, 
but in its form. The matter was got from his inner ex- 
perience and from his own countryside, that fair appari- 
tion that shone so peacefully about him. The form was 
gained from much reading in the old English poets, the 
Cambridge philosophers, and the ancient classical 
writers. 
We are now in a position to explain three principles at 
the bottom of Emerson’s philosophy. They are imma- 
nence in respect to nature; benevolence in respect to 
God ; self-reliance in respect to man. Immanence implies 
the unity of the intelligent principle in the world, in the 
creation itself. Here man calls the universal soul, rea- 
son; it is not mine or thine, or his, but we are its. And 
the blue sky in which the private earth is buried, the 
sky with its eternal calm, is the type of reason... . 
Again, immanence implies that all that exists, exists in 
God, and that there is no difference in substance between 
the universe and God. Man as a part of nature is akin 
to the divine spirit. . . . When I behold the sunrise 
. . . 1 seem to partake of its rapid transformations. . . . 
Thus does nature deify us. 
In these broken words Emerson hints at that funda-
-P-A-G-E-155
  EMERSON, INTERPRETER OF NATURE 147 
mental coalescence between the circles of his system. 
Man partakes of nature, nature partakes of deity, and, 
through the enshrouding universal spirit, each partakes 
of all. These beliefs came as a revulsion from the old 
Calvinistie transcendence. The doctrine of a deity 
separate from his world, absolute, arbitrary, inscrutable 
in his ways, is now supplanted by the doctrine of the 
deification of the world, and the rendering of it rea- 
sonable by the indwelling of an intelligent principle. 
There is also a revulsion from another sort of transcend- 
ence, that of deism. Instead of the mechanical separa- 
tion between deity and humanity that was held almost 
up to Emerson’s day, there comes a joining of the two 
by means of a mediating principle, great nature itself. 
Because God is in his world and man is part of that 
world, it comes to pass that man feels within himself 
the divine currents, is conscious of a universal soul 
within his individual life. 
There is next the principle of benevolence in respect 
to the deity. It is a good God that has made this goodly 
world. With this conviction there arises the splendid 
optimism in the pages of the transcendentalist. After 
Emerson had laid down the fundamental principles of 
immanence, he takes up as the first use of nature that 
of commodity. Under this general name he ranks those 
advantages which our senses owe to nature. By it we 
may explore that steady and prodigal provision that has 
been made for man’s support and delight on this green 
ball which floats him through the heaven. . . . In all 
this there is a close resemblance to the old deistic delight 
in nature as an embodiment of the divine goodness. 
But a glamor is put upon it by the poetic New Eng- 
lander. The argument for deistic design had degenerated 
into such forms as the Bridgewater Treatises, which af- 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
148 TRANSCENDENTALISM 
  forded a combination of special providences with the 
shallow sciences of the day. Now, the purpose or the 
utility, or the commodity which Emerson found in na- 
ture was not special but general; not mechanical, but 
esthetic. Hence arises his poetic apostrophe: What 
angels invented these splendid ornaments, these rich 
conveniences, this ocean of air above, this ocean of 
water beneath, this firmament of earth between; this 
zodiac of lights, this tent of dropping clouds, this striped 
coat of climates, this fourfold year? 
Immanence and benevolence have been combined in an 
optimistic form of pantheism. This is in decided con- 
trast to the pantheism of Europe, which had so often 
tended towards the pessimistic. On this side of the 
water there was no world-weariness, but a joy of living 
and a true love of the soil. This was a new land for 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. There was 
no pressure on population, but a chance for all men to 
make their way. The fact that the ardent spirit might 
plant his foot on the ladder of fortune had much to do 
with the bright outlook. When the younger generation 
left New England, men were heartened by the reports 
of their success on the frontier. Indeed, the winning 
of the West was a highly exciting and vivifying process. 
And, finally, while much of the pessimism of the cold 
world may be laid to the gray skies of the northern 
climes, here, the clear skies, the cold waves, the rapid 
changes in temperature, stirred up the blood and stimu- 
lated the animal spirits. So we find Emerson an op- 
timist, pointing to those ‘‘ admirable stars of possibility 
and the yet untouched continent of hope glittering with 
all its mountains in the vast west.’’? It is for these rea- 
sons also that we find not a single prophet of woe among 
the transcendentalists. Alcott’s optimism was carried
-P-A-G-E-157
EMERSON, INTERPRETER OF NATURE 149 
  almost to excess; he seldom saw anything except in the 
fervid hue of rosy hope. Thoreau, though a Diogenes, 
was not a Cynic: he lived by himself, but he lived joy- 
ously ; his withdrawal from society, his return to nature, 
were made not because he was a fatalist, but because in 
nature he found a field where man was free to hunt for 
happiness. 
The optimism of this philosophic era of good feeling 
was extended from nature as a whole to human nature. 
Taking over the high deistic praises of human goodness, 
that complacency over man and his achievements which 
marked the eighteenth century, the younger generation 
joined this to an incipient doctrine of development. If 
nature is growing perfect, man as a serial part of nature 
is perfectible. All this explains the sudden outburst of 
egotistic optimism which took place in New England. 
In the Unitarian Manifesto of 1815, in the diaries of the 
radical transcendentalists, we find a revulsion against 
Puritanie pessimism, and a reviling of the doctrine of 
human depravity. In one way all these phases of 
thought do not obtain in Emerson’s case. It was a 
sign of his precocity that he very early decided that this 
was a good world, and the men in it good; that deity 
was kindly disposed towards all, and that all men were 
open to the solicitations of the spirit. And yet Emer- 
son’s life was not without adversity. He had fought 
against poverty, ill health, and family losses; and it was 
through his own courage that, after a period of mor- 
bidity and doubt, he came out with that serenity of faith 
that characterized the essay on Nature and all he wrote 
thereafter. 
/ To the last principle of Emerson’s thought we need 
devote but a few words. That self-reliance on which he 
dwelt is to be derived from the doctrine of the per-  
-P-A-G-E-158
  150 TRANSCENDENTALISM 
fectibility of man. It is a result of the deistic com- 
placency, and not, as has often been held, a corollary 
of Calvinism. Puritans have been called self-reliant; 
they were, but not through the principles of their creed. 
Amongst the best of them, their self-reliance was naught 
but God-reliance. <A logical Calvinist could not depend 
on himself, but had to lean on Providence. Amongst 
the weak brethren was this especially true. The Cal- 
vinist who believed in particular providences was al- 
ways begging for favors from his God. We need but 
note Cotton Mather’s agonies of soul over his impotence 
to save himself and the sniffling spirit with which he 
sought for special privileges. Neither one way nor the 
other can self-reliance be derived from the doctrines of 
Puritanism. There were other factors at work; British 
blood and American achievements were the real causes 
for the new spirit. The whining attitude, which at times 
possessed New England’s religionists, passed rapidly 
away after the second war with England. With their 
eyes on the naval victories of that day, the commonalty 
became so excessively self-reliant that, in a cant phrase 
of the times, they could whip the universe. Yet the 
country was better represented by those of more quiet 
minds, who came to rely on themselves and not on a 
reputation. Descendants of the Puritans, they longed 
for spiritual improvement and sought it in the oneness 
of the individual with nature. 
It is here that there arises a contradiction between the 
reliance on self and the reliance on the not-self. Emer- 
son resolved this contradiction by making the two, one. 
Because man is a part of nature, because nature par- 
takes of deity, there is an unbreakable bond between 
these elements. Man may rely on his reason because this 
reason is not to be distinguished from the divine essence.
-P-A-G-E-159
  
  EMERSON, INTERPRETER OF NATURE 151 
This is the paradox of pantheism at which Emerson ulti- 
mately arrived. But in order that there may be no 
abrupt identification between human and divine, he 
brings in a third factor, the external world, which gives 
to man the perpetual presence of the sublime. 
The inference may still be made that if Emerson was a 
pantheist, he must be a determinist and a fatalist. We 
nevertheless find him reiterating his belief in the dig- 
nity of human nature and the excellence of self-reliance. 
How may this be reconciled with his statement that 
nature is an embodied law whose divine order is in- 
violable to us? In reply we may point out that this is 
not the Puritanic fatalism where nature is arbitrary, 
full of strange and overwhelming mischances. No, 
Emerson is opposed to arbitrary decrees; to him nature 
is inviolable, but never inscrutable. Provided man is 
open to the solicitations of the spirit, nature is essen- 
tially comprehensible and rational. 
In this Emerson shows his Americanism. His deter- 
minism is modified in a novel way. It does not resem- 
ble the European fatalism derived from a philosophy 
of the unconscious, based upon a blind will working in 
us, we know not how. As a true son of the soil Emerson 
is willing to be ruled, but not as a puppet worked from 
behind the scenes. If he obeys the law like a good citi- 
zen, he wants to know how he is ruled. As in the proper 
form of the American government, from the town meet- 
ing to the administration of Washington, he expects to 
find things run in an open and above-board fashion. 
And thus he comes to put this political interpretation 
upon nature: It is something to be scrutinized in its 
actions; it also stands as a representative of the will 
of man. 
Nature is open to scrutiny first by symbolism; it al-
-P-A-G-E-160
  152 TRANSCENDENTALISM 
ways has a meaning; it can be interpreted. The use of 
natural history, says the transcendentalist, is to give 
us aid in supernatural history. Thus arises that radi- 
calism in Emerson’s philosophy which did so much to 
soften its apparent determinism. In its first aspects 
nature seems a discipline; its function that of a task- 
master, and a mere obedient subject to that law which is 
king of kings. But Emerson, as a representative of a 
self-ruling people, will not allow that this is a final end 
of nature. Law as law is not paramount. Mere sci- 
entific formule are not enough. He declares that we 
must seek for a higher end and purpose, a spiritual prin- 
ciple running through all phenomena. So idealism is 
an hypothesis to account for nature on other principles 
than those of carpentry and chemistry, and the spiritual 
principle should demonstrate itself to the end. In the 
mastery of nature, man has first to learn its ways... . 
By discipline is the unspeakable but intelligible and prac- 
ticable meaning of the world conveyed to man, the mor- 
tal pupil in every object of sense. But, adds the idealist, 
man as part of the universe has an immediate and in- 
tuitive knowledge of its innermost essence, and thus may 
he transcend those very objects of sense. Therefore, he 
continues, if the reason be stimulated to more earnest 
vision, outlines and surfaces become transparent, and 
are no longer seen; causes and spirits are seen through 
them. 
This is the turning point in the resolution of deter- 
minism. Knowledge is power and by this power man is 
able to pierce through the veil and to find that nature, 
which before this seemed all-powerful, has a secondary 
place. Emerson carries out his reasoning in the follow- 
ing remarkable passage: But whilst we acquiesce en- 
tirely in the permanence of natural laws, the question of
-P-A-G-E-161
EMERSON, INTERPRETER OF NATURE 153 
  the absolute existence of nature remains open. It is the 
uniform effect of culture on the human mind, not to 
shake our faith in the stability of particular phenomena, 
as of heat, water, azote; but to lead us to regard nature 
as a phenomenon, not a substance; to attribute necessary 
existence to spirit; to esteem nature as an accident and 
an effect. . . . With this assertion of the primacy of 
reason a strict determinism vanishes. The great prin- 
ciple is not fatality, but regularity; nature is no longer 
dominant over man but man learns to manipulate na- 
ture. The sensual man, continues Emerson, conforms 
thoughts to things; but the poet conforms things to his 
thoughts. The one esteems nature as rooted and fast, 
the other as fluid; he impresses his being thereon; to him 
the refractory world is ductile and flexible. 
Emerson had stated that nature’s divine order was 
inviolable to us; he now goes so far as to make that 
nature a mere appendix to the soul. This reversal of 
a former judgment needs to be explained. How may we 
reconcile the discrepancy as to the over-lordship of man? 
It is by recalling the kinship that exists between man 
and the world. Both are imbued with reason, in each is 
a common essence. The solid-seeming block of matter 
has been pervaded and dissolved by a thought; this feeble 
human being has penetrated the vast masses of nature 
with an informing soul, and recognized itself in their 
harmony, that is, seized their law. 
In offering this solution Emerson has united two sides 
of his nature, his law-abiding disposition and his strain 
of Puritanism. The one side acknowledges conscious 
law as king of kings; the other contemns the unsubstan- 
tial shows of the world. But again, it may be asked, does 
not the latter belief preclude the former? If all is an 
illusion, is not nature’s law an illusion? Emerson, with
-P-A-G-E-162
  154 TRANSCENDENTALISM 
his inherent common sense, cannot so answer. He re- 
marks that while the devotee flouts nature, he loves it, 
for the advantage of the ideal theory over the popular 
faith is that it transcends the world in precisely that 
view which is most desirable to the mind,—a ‘‘ vast pic- 
ture which God paints on the instant eternity for the 
contemplation of the soul.’’ In this theorizing some 
may say there is shallowness; that it is merely the artist’s 
way of working; that it attempts to wipe out all nature 
as an unsubstantial pageant. This is a misinterpreta- 
tion. Emerson is no illusionist, but an ideal realist. 
Nature is not an accident, in the sense of being a mere 
chance happening, but rather in the sense of being the 
manifestation of a substance most profound and real. So 
he clings to this brave lodging, wherein man is harbored, 
and holds that this is the use of nature, that it is faith- 
ful to the cause whence it had its origin. It always 
speaks of spirit. It suggests the absolute. It is a per- 
petual effect. It is a great shadow pointing always to 
the sun behind us. 
& 
e) Tue Sources oF TRANSCENDENTALISM 
In his definitive address on the Transcendentalist 
Emerson remarks that the first thing we have to say re- 
specting what are called the new views here in New 
England at the present time, is that they are not new, 
but the very oldest thoughts cast into the mold of these 
new times. Upon this disavowal there follows a defini- 
tion of the movement in which the author was enmeshed. 
What is properly called transcendentalism among us, 
he continues, is idealism, idealism as it appears in 1842. 
As such it is a protest against materialism. In place of 
experience, of the data of the senses, of the force of cir-
-P-A-G-E-163
    
THE SOURCES OF TRANSCENDENTALISM = 155 
cumstances, ot the animal wants of man, it insists on 
consciousness, on the power of thought and of will, on 
inspiration, on individual culture. Again, while the 
materialist respects sensible masses, the idealist has an- 
other measure which is metaphysical, namely the rank 
which things themselves take in his consciousness; not 
at all the size or appearance. He does not respect labor, 
or the products of labor, namely property, otherwise than 
as a manifold symbol, illustrating with wonderful fidelity 
of details the law of being. His experience inclines him 
to behold the procession of facts you call the world, as 
flowing perpetually outward from an invisible un- 
sounded center in himself. Finally, he believes in 
miracle, in the perpetual openness of the human mind to 
new influx of light and power; he believes in inspiration 
and in ecstasy. 
It is obvious from this confession of philosophic faith 
(that New England transcendentalism was, in many \ 
\ \_ Points, only a new name for old ways of thinking. , AA 
Clearly did it re-echo the voice of the past: that of 
Plato in its doctrines of the scale of being and of the 
symbolism of nature, that of Plotinus in its insistence on 
emanation and on ecstasy. And as Emerson was not un- 
mindful of his debt to antiquity, so also was he conscious 
of more recent influences. Many, he recalls, have been 
the prophets and heralds of the transcendental philos- 
ophy, for this way of thinking, falling on prelatical 
times, made Puritans and Quakers; and falling on Uni- 
tarian and commercial times makes the peculiar shades 
of idealism which we know. 
Thus far Emerson has suggested many sources of his 
thought,—from Platonism to Puritanism, from Neo- 
Platonism to Unitarianism. But not until this point 
does he mention that name above all names which
-P-A-G-E-164
    156 TRANSCENDENTALISM 
popular opinion has held to be the fouat and origin 
of the New England transcendentalism. It is well 
known to most of my audience, he explains, that the 
idealism of the present day acquired the name of 
Transcendentalism from the use of that term by Im- 
manuel Kant of Kénigsberg, who replied to the skep- 
tical philosophy of Locke, which insisted that there 
was nothing in the intellect which was not previ- 
ously in the experience of the senses, by showing that 
there was a very important class of ideas or imperative 
forms, which did not come by experience, but through 
which experience was acquired ; that these were intuitions 
of the mind itself; and he denominated them Tran- 
scendental forms. The extraordinary profoundness and 
precision of that man’s thinking have given vogue to his 
nomenclature in Europe and America, to that extent 
that whatever belongs to the class of intuitive thought 
is popularly called at the present day transcendental. 
Emerson has suggested three sources of his philosophy 
—Hellenic, American, and Germanic. As the Germanic 
is considered the most important it may be left to the last; 
only after other possible alternatives have been weighed 
can we decide upon the alleged preponderance of the 
Teutonic influences. So, too, of the nearer native influ- 
ences there must be taken into account the reactions 
from the movements current in the stream of Emerson’s 
own life. Thus, in the way of revulsion, he developed 
from the Hobbite materialism a preference for the in- 
stinctive and intuitive; from the Lockean negation of 
innate ideas the assertion of subjective principles of 
reason; from the Humean skepticism the avowal of a 
faculty transcending the senses and the understanding. 
In addition, there were other forms of thought, actually 
naturalized in the land, containing the very elements of  
-P-A-G-E-165
THE SOURCES OF TRANSCENDENTALISM 157 
  transcendentalism which Emerson was destined to ae- 
quire. Thus, Unitarianism furnished him with its lib- 
erality, Quakerism with its mystic spirit, and Puritanism 
with its individualism. This was the trinity of powers 
that energized his growing mind. Born eighth in a line 
of Puritan divines, he received as his heritage discipline 
without dogma; inclined by this heritage toward the 
interior or hidden life, he was prepared to welcome the 
habit of introspection and solitude. But, above all, liv- 
ing in the transitional era of Unitarianism, he was sub- 
ject to all the varying forces of which that movement was 
the resultant. 
The resolution of these forces has been attempted, 
but not from the philosophic point of view. It has been 
pointed out how the old Calvinistic stock split.into two 
branches—orthodox and Unitarian, and the Unitarian 
\ again into conservative and transcendental. Such is the 
family tree of the New England mind in black and white. 
But obviously we need a greater variety of hues to give 
its natural appearance, to explain the transition from 
the mere light and shade of Calvinism to the highly 
colored emotionalism of radical transcendentalism. That 
transition forms a veritable speculative spectrum of the 
times. In New England men had passed through various 
phases: Puritanism had sought the purity of faith; in 
the worship of a transcendent Absolute the ascription of 
any feeling was deemed to stain the white radiance of 
eternity. Next, Calvinism was succeeded by deism, the 
worship of deity by the worship of humanity, and with 
the succession there came a change towards the warmer 
tones of emotion. Lastly, arose a true philosophy of 
_ feeling, for romanticism discovered a division between 
those Unitarians who were content with the cold light of 
reason and those who preferred the rosier hues of en- Vi 
K
-P-A-G-E-166
158 TRANSCENDENTALISM 
  thusiasm and ecstasy. Romanticism has been properly 
given as the cause of the transition from coldness to 
warmth, from sense to sensibility. Before this there was 
little to satisfy the heart. Just as the Most High God 
of the Puritans had degenerated into a mere dispenser of 
special providences, so the light of reason of the deistic 
rationalists had faded out into the twilight of Humean 
skepticism—‘‘ the frigid and empty theism ’’ against 
which Emerson rebelled. Unitarianism had suffered 
from a heart-withering philosophy. As Channing put 
it, men must look to other schools for the thoughts to 
thrill them, to touch the most inward springs, and dis- 
close the depths of their own souls. 
Whence were to come these new thoughts, half desired, 
half feared? It was the romantic movement as it took 
the several forms of French naturalism, English pan- 
theism, and German idealism that was to furnish the 
influences. Of these three forms the first had least 
weight. Rousseau’s return to nature came to be inter- 
preted as a return to natural passion, and the Gallic 
materialism to be confused with the excesses of the mob; 
indeed the New England Federalists turned a cold 
shoulder upon the rights of man as exemplified in the 
French Revolution. Thus, at the age of nineteen, Emer- 
son himself confesses his belief that nobody now regards 
the maxim ‘‘ all men are born equal,’’ as anything more 
than a convenient hypothesis or an extravagant declama- 
tion. Of the English romantic influences it was the 
poetic pantheism of the Lake School that so warmed the 
heart of Emerson. The old Puritanic aloofness from the 
world, the conviction that matter and spirit are essen- 
tially alien, was now giving way to a feeling of kinship 
between human nature and the world of nature. 
Te come to the crucial point. It has been commonly 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
  THE SOURCES OF TRANSCENDENTALISM = 159 
thought that the transcendentalists early partook of the 
German idealism; that from across the Rhine came the 
fresh breezes that drove away the ‘‘ pale negations of 
Boston Unitarianism.’’ It was in 1820 that Edward 
Everett, George Bancroft, and George Ticknor returned 
to America from Goettingen. Yet of these men Emerson, 
in this connection, mentions but one, and gives no hint 
that he imported a knowledge of technical transcendental- 
ism. Germany, Emerson recalled later, had created criti- 
cism in vain for us until Edward Everett returned from 
his five years in Europe and brought to Cambridge his 
rich results . . . he made us for the first time acquainted 
with Wolft’s theory of the Homeric writings and with 
the criticism of Heine. 
This is the fullest statement, before his first published 
book Nature, that the author makes as to the influence of 
Germany upon his mind. Previous to 1836 we find in 
his Journals only these nominal references: to Kant 
once; to Fichte thrice ; to Schelling twice ; to Hegel twice. 
Indeed the American’s knowledge of German meta- 
physics was slight and secondary. He made a few ex- 
tracts in his blotter from a translation of Fichte, not 
knowing as yet the tongue of the original. Later, at the 
solicitation of Carlyle, he learned to read the works of 
Goethe, yet even here he found but a confirmation of his 
own beliefs and his sense of originality did not forsake 
him. Five months before the proof-sheets of Nature 
reached him he made this complacent note: Only last 
evening I find the following sentence in Goethe, a com- 
ment and consent to my speculations on the All in Each 
in Nature this last week. 
In truth it may be repeated that Emerson’s knowledge 
of the German schools was not only slight, but second- 
ary, when he could declare that the love of the vast came  
-P-A-G-E-168
  160 TRANSCENDENTALISM 
from Germany to America through Coleridge. How the 
latter became the medium through the American edition 
of his Aids to Reflection we shall consider subsequently ; 
meanwhile we must seek for other and earlier tendencies 
that brought the Massachusetts leader into the tran- 
scendental drift. Of these tendencies he was more or less 
unconscious, for the name of transcendentalism, he as- 
serts, was given nobody knows by whom, or when it was 
first applied. 
Yet for us, looking back on those times, it is not im- 
possible to point out certain definite factors that led to 
the Emersonian type of mind. The prime factor was 
British. It was an Anglo-American environment that 
was furnished by the Boston of that day. Here two 
forms of thought led to the transcendental strain: the 
Irish idealism of George Berkeley, the English idealism 
of the Cambridge and Oxford Platonists. Of the former 
there were few general traces, for though the good bishop 
had lived for three years in Rhode Island his views, as 
those of an Anglican churchman, were not acceptable to 
Massachusetts Congregationalists. And yet we have a 
record of the great immaterialist’s power over Emerson 
when he said: ‘‘ I know but one solution to my nature 
and relations, which I find in remembering the joy with 
which in my boyhood I caught the first hint of the Ber- 
keleian philosophy, and which I certainly never lost 
sight of afterwards.’? To what extent Berkeley held 
sway over Emerson it would be hard to say, for the kin- 
dred beliefs in sense symbolism and the divine visual 
language the latter might have drawn from the Platoniz- 
ing poets. Such were Quarles and Vaughan and espe- 
cially George Herbert, from whom Emerson was so fond 
of quoting lines that taught the congruity between things 
and thoughts, between forms and mind.
-P-A-G-E-169
THE SOURCES OF TRANSCENDENTALISM 161 
Such were certain of the earlier idealistic influences 
upon the young New Englander. Yet more important 
than the Irish idealist, and the poetic symbolists, was 
the influence of the older English lines. That influence 
was of double significance, since through men like Cud- 
worth and More, Norris and Collier, Emerson was led to 
manifest his spiritual affinity with both Kant and Plato. 
How far the Koenigsberger was anticipated by the Cam- 
bridge and Oxford Platonists has been suggested by 
William James and carried out by Arthur Lovejoy. For 
example, in Cudworth’s True Intellectual System of the 
Universe are to be discovered not only a general em- 
phasis on nativism, and preference for the innate and 
intuitive over the empirical and sensualistic, but also 
an anticipation of the Kantian a priori concepts of ob- 
jects and the wisdom of pure speculative reason. It 
was in Cudworth that Emerson had read from time to 
time for years, and through him, in his college days, had 
obtained his first glimpse into Plato. Again it was Cud- 
worth who prepared the way for Coleridge, and Coleridge 
who furnished the easiest way to Kant for English read- 
ers. That the Aids to Reflection should have been issued 
as early as 1829 in New England is not surprising, 
when we remember that Emerson declared that the feel- 
ing of the Infinite finds a most genial climate in the 
American mind. So the Cambridge Platonist opened the 
way back to his ancient master. Of Plato Emerson ex- 
claims: ‘‘ I hesitate to speak lest there should be no end. 
He contains the future, as he came out of the past.’’ 
Statements like these call for a reversal of the ordinary 
judgment as to the inspiration of our foremost tran- 
scendentalist. In truth it was the philosopher of the 
Academy and not of Koenigsberg who, by his own early 
confession, was Hmerson’s master. As is shown by that 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
162 TRANSCENDENTALISM 
  essay in Representative Men he was almost convinced 
that ‘‘ transcendental truths have a kind of filial retro- 
spect to Plato and the Greeks.’’ 
We have examined the three suggested sources for 
the Emersonian philosophy, namely the Germanic, Brit- 
ish, and Hellenic. The first, in the prevalent opinion, 
is held to be paramount, but that opinion cannot be ad- 
hered to if the two others will account for the facts. The 
acquisition of the Kantian system was a well-nigh im- 
possible task in a land where German literature was, as 
yet, known only by name. For instance, the first refer- 
ence to Immanuel Kant in the country was given in a 
Philadelphia magazine of 1798, and that reference was 
only at second hand, while the first decent exposition of 
the Critique of Pure Reason was published by a Yale 
graduate in 1842. Meanwhile in Massachusetts, in the 
period half-way between these dates, there was a piti- 
able dearth of literature on the subject. George Ticknor, 
before he set sail for Goettingen in 1815, was obliged 
to send to New Hampshire, ‘‘ where he learned there was 
a German dictionary.’’ It is true that in the same year 
there was for sale by a Boston bookseller a London trans- 
lation of the Elements of the Critical Philosophy, but 
it was not for some years later that the little band of 
enthusiasts from Goettingen returned to Harvard. This 
was the band, headed by Edward Everett, that Emerson 
mentions as arousing an interest in German modes of 
criticism. Now that criticism, it will be recalled, was 
more literary than philosophical. 
In the meantime Emerson’s drift towards idealism had 
been hastened more by a revulsion against the current 
metaphysic than by a knowledge of the new. Shortly 
before he came of age, he protested against the college 
curriculum with its emphasis on ‘‘ reasoning machines,’’
-P-A-G-E-171
  
THE SOURCES OF TRANSCENDENTALISM — 163 
such as Locke, and Clarke, and David Hume. In his 
required studies he had received such an overdose of the 
Essay on Human Understanding that he wrote that 
‘* while the inspired poets will be Platonists, the dull 
men will be Lockeists.’’ It is this dislike of the sensa- 
tionalistie denial of innate ideas that brought out Emer- 
son’s latent transcendentalism. Against empiricism he 
protested that there were truths higher than those given 
by experience; against sensationalism that there were 
intuitions higher than those given by the senses. So, 
from a temperamental reaction Emerson went back to 
the English Platonists and through them back to the 
ancients. Immediately after the issuance of his first work 
he writes: Any history of philosophy fortifies my faith 
by showing me that what high dogmas I had supposed 
were the rare and late fruit of a cumulative culture, 
and only now possible to some recent Kant or Fichte,— 
were the prompt improvisations of the earliest in- 
quirers. 
Such confessions show how lastingly Hellenism was 
impressed upon the mind of Emerson. As a boy in col- 
lege, through Cudworth’s citations, he had come upon 
Plato; later he added that ‘‘ it was a great day in a 
man’s life when he first read the Symposium.’’ Lastly 
there was the notable essay in Representative Men show- 
ing that Plato forms the most continuously powerful in- 
fluence in Emerson’s thinking. Moreover, we know from 
new sources that the ancients were Emerson’s chief teach- 
ers in transcendentalism. The Journals tell us how as 
an undergraduate, having no faculty for mathematics, he 
was wont to console himself with Plutarch and Plato 
at night; how, again, he considered himself, and not his 
instructors, the true philosopher in college, because he 
read for ‘‘ lustres’’ in Plato; how, finally, he sought

  Coleridge in England and from him learned that the 
problem of philosophy, according to Plato, is for all that 
exists conditionally, to find a ground unconditioned and 
absolute. 
Three years after the visit to Coleridge, Emerson 
utilized this opinion as his definition of idealism in his 
first book, entitled Nature. How largely that work was 
woven out of the shining fabric of antiquity can be seen 
from an analysis of its contents. The original edition 
has for its motto a sentence of Plotinus: ‘‘ Nature is 
but an image or imitation of wisdom, the last thing of the 
soul.’? The same author furnishes the grounds for that 
baffling dualism which Emerson ever sought to resolve 
into its spiritual elements. Plotinus declares: ‘‘ What 
the world ends in, therefore, is matter and reason, but 
that from which it arose, and by which it is good, is 
soul.’’? In like manner Emerson, giving as his postulate, 
“* philosophically considered, the universe is composed of 
nature and the soul,’’ goes on to sublimate nature in 
those sections which begin with Commodity, pass through 
Symbolism, and end in the doctrine of Universal Spirit, 
or Over-Soul. 
How kindred to his own mind was the ancient way of 
thinking is clearly seen in the successive sections of this 
little book with all its transport and radiancy of thought. 
Given as our task to interrogate the great apparition that 
shines so peacefully around us, the lover of nature is 
defined as he whose mind and outward senses are still 
truly adjusted to each other; who has retained the spirit 
-of infancy even in the era of manhood. Here is the 
Platonic doctrine of reminiscence which, as originally 
suggested to Emerson by Wordsworth’s Ode on the In- 
timations of Immortality, was carried out in his own 
boyish poem, ‘‘ Man in the bush with God may meet.’  
-P-A-G-E-173
  THE SOURCES OF TRANSCENDENTALISM 165 
Again in the section on Commodity we have as the first of 
the fourfold root of the final cause of nature, the doctrine 
of compensation,—that all parts of nature incessantly 
work into each other’s hands for the profit of man. Fol- 
lowing the lines of the Platonizing Herbert’s poem on 
Man, this is but the expression of Emerson’s youthful 
experience when he lay on his bed pleasing himself with 
the beauty of the Lord’s equilibrium of the universe, in- 
stead of shuddering at the terrors of his judgments. . . . 
Also is a nobler want of man served by nature, namely 
the love of beauty; for such is the meaning of the word 
cosmos; as understood by the Greeks the world demands, 
as essential to its perfection, the presence of a higher, 
spiritual element. While Emerson designates this want 
of man as Hellenic he would add to it that esthetic 
interest of his own people,—the love of the beauty of 
holiness. So, he adds, the problem of restoring to the 
world original and eternal beauty is solved by the re- 
demption of the soul. 
Now Emerson approaches a cherished belief—that 
of nature as a great symbol. As if following the apoca- 
lypse of loveliness unfolded by Berkeley in his divine 
visual language, he explicitly states that language is the 
third use which nature subserves to man and has a three- 
fold degree: first, words are the signs of natural facts; 
again, particular natural facts are symbols of particu- 
lar spiritual facts: every appearance in nature corre- 
sponds to some state of the mind, for man is conscious of 
a universal soul within or behind his individual life; 
lastly, nature is the symbol of spirit; because it is em- 
blematic the universe becomes transparent, for the light 
of higher laws than its own shines through it; this is the 
standing problem which has exercised the wonder and 
study of every fine genius since the world began, from  
-P-A-G-E-174
166 TRANSCENDENTALISM 
  Pythagoras and Plato to Bacon, Leibniz, and Sweden- 
borg. 
That nature is the symbol of spirit lies at the bottom of 
the Timeus. But the next contention concerning the 
ethical import of natural law, or what Emerson calls dis- 
cipline, is not strictly Platonic. In other words, that the 
axioms of physics apply to morals is not of the Acad- 
emy but of a later school, being rather of Plotinus than 
of Plato. For this confusion two reasons have been 
given,—Emerson’s use of Thomas Taylor’s translation 
of Plato which was edited from the Neo-Platonic point 
of view, and Coleridge’s attempt to harmonize Plato’s 
philosophy of the good with Lord Bacon’s search of 
truth. But this is going too far afield. There is a more 
natural and more native source for this inversion of 
Platonism. If Plato found the idea of the good giving 
unity to the ideas in the intelligible world, Emerson 
found the laws of the world leading up to the universal 
good, and this because he was in the deistic drift. Cosmic 
benevolence was a favorite theme of the Harvard worth- 
ies. Even the austere Cotton Mather, as we recall, had 
composed a cheerful little book entitled, The Christian 
Philosopher. A Collection of the Best Discoveries in 
Nature with Religious Improvements. And his more 
genial successor, Charles Chauncy, issued his Benevo- 
lence of the Deity, which was in harmony with that series 
of Dudleian lectures which were a familiar feature of 
college in Emerson’s undergraduate days. It was the 
philosophic age of optimism in his own land that left 
their mild marks on Emerson’s doctrine of discipline. 
At the opening of his literary career, he feels noble emo- 
tions dilating him as his mind apprehends, one after an- 
other, the laws of physics. Later he found the survey 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  THE SOURCES OF TRANSCENDENTALISM 167 
of cosmical powers a means of consolation in the dark 
hours of private misfortune. 
The transcendentalist here discloses himself more than 
a Platonizer; he is a modernizer. Cudworth opened to 
him the Platonic symbolism; ‘‘ analogy-loving souls ’’ 
like Bruno and Donne, Herbert, Crashaw, and Vaughan 
gave him its poetic form; he himself now attempts, as an 
higher synthesis, the harmony of religion and science. 
How wide was his reading in the. latter subject may be 
inferred from his book lists, where are to be found 
mention of such masters of science as Newton, Laplace 
and Hunter, Linneeus, Lamarck and Herschel, Owen, 
Lyell, and Faraday. An earlier reference shows for 
what end he had been gathering these stores. As he 
had already declared: the religion that is afraid of sci- 
ence dishonors God and commits suicide; it acknowledges 
that it is not equal to the whole of truth, that it legis- 
lates, tyrannizes, over a village of God’s empire, but it is 
not the immutable, universal law. But because all things 
are moral, and in their boundless changes have an un- 
ceasing reference to spiritual nature, herein is appre- 
hended the unity of nature,—all the endless variety of 
things make an identical impression. 
Substantiating his belief in the essential unity of na- 
ture by a reference to Xenophanes, Emerson now passes 
to that most central and vital of his doctrines. For his 
first lesson in idealism he recalls when as a child he 
amused himself in saying over such common words as 
“* black,’’ ‘‘ white,’’ ‘‘ board,’’ twenty or thirty times 
until the words lost all meaning and fixedness, and he 
began to doubt which was the right name for the thing. 
Now, a nobler doubt perpetually suggests itself . . . to 
give a sufficient account of that Appearance we call the 
World; in my utter impotence to test the authenticity
-P-A-G-E-176
  168 TRANSCENDENTALISM 
of the report of my senses, to know whether the im- 
pressions they make on me correspond with outlying 
objects, what difference does it make, whether Orion is 
up there in heaven, or some god paints the image in the 
firmament of the soul? How is the doubt resolved? 
By the end for which nature exists; whether it enjoys 
a substantial existence without or is only in the apoca- 
lypse of the mind, it is alike useful and alike venerable 
to me. 
As the section on Discipline suggested that the ethical 
character so penetrates the bone and marrow of nature 
as to seem the end for which it was made, so that on 
Idealism, bears this notion out. Religion, in teaching 
that the things that are unseen are eternal, does for 
the unschooled what philosophy does for Berkeley. It 
discloses the whole circle of persons and things, of actions 
and events, as one vast picture which God paints on the 
instant eternity for the contemplation of the soul... . 
In this ardent exposition of the divine visual language, 
the Irish idealist of the eighteenth century has found 
an American disciple in the nineteenth. That westward 
strand, whither Berkeley came with such high hopes, at 
last brought forth a follower who could sympathetically 
interpret the uses of nature. Behind nature, throughout 
nature, says Emerson, spirit is present; one, and not com- 
pound, it does not act upon us from without, that is in 
space and time, but spiritually, or through ourselves; 
therefore, that spirit, that is, the Supreme Being, does 
not build up nature around us, but puts it forth through 
us, as the life of the tree puts forth new branches and 
leaves through the pores of the old. . . . Nature is thus 
an incarnation of God, a projection of God; its serene 
‘ate is inviolable to us; it is, therefore, to us, the pres-   t expositor of the divine mind. 
\ 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
    
THE SOURCES OF TRANSCENDENTALISM 169 
With this rhapsody over spirit—the dread universal 
essence—Emerson concludes his great essay on Nature 
with a section entitled Prospects. To what end is this 
apparition that shines about us? A little poem by 
George Herbert on Man gives him the clew. When the 
English Platonist affirms, ‘‘ nothing we see but means 
our good,’’ the American, in a like strain, exclaims, 
“* When I behold a rich landscape, it is to know why all 
thought of multitude is lost in a tranquil sense of unity.’’ 
Here is a final note of mysticism, of the absorption of 
the self in the All, and with this Emerson rounds out 
that Platonism which was his by heritage, by tempera- 
ment, and by training. By heritage he was familiar with 
the latent idealistic teachings of the Puritans concern- 
ing ‘‘ the unsubstantial shows of the world as vanities, 
dreams, shadows, unrealities.’? Nevertheless he did not 
accept the Puritan’s morbid and distorted use of such 
teachings. I have, he adds, no hostility to nature, but a 
child’s love for it. I do not wish to fling stones at my 
beautiful mother. . . . If Emerson’s temperament swect- 
ened the strain of idealism handed down from Puritan 
days, his training strengthened it. And that training, 
it must be insisted, was largely self-training. It was not 
Plato and Berkeley, but Locke and Reid who were im- 
pressed upon the boy in college, and least of all had the 
Germans any effect upon his thought. As he informed a 
friend, in this connection, he need not consult the Ger- 
mans, but if he wished at any time to know what the 
transcendentalists believed, he might simply omit what 
in his own mind he added (to his simple perception) from 
the tradition, and the rest would be transcendentalism. 
That Emerson was not of the Germanic type, but 
rather a legitimate successor of the British Platonizers is 
further borne out by the direct testimony of Coleridge,
-P-A-G-E-178
  170 TRANSCENDENTALISM 
who contends that the Concord philosopher was one 
of those few Americans who, in opposition to the 
current empiricism, which made all human knowledge 
derived from sensations, took up with Berkeley’s ideal- 
ism, which made immediate divine agency the sole cause 
of all the phenomena of the material world. In regard to 
Coleridge, Emerson had visited the sage of Highgate in 
1833, but the visit he pronounced rather a spectacle 
than a conversation, of no use beyond the satisfaction of 
one’s curiosity. Meanwhile in an adjoining State there 
had been issued an American edition of the Aids to Re- 
flection with a competent introduction by President 
Marsh, and it was this work which did most to introduce 
the modified German philosophy into our country. 
If Emerson has any strain of the foreign transcenden- 
talism, it is in this modified and mediate form. He 
possessed no such direct knowledge of Kant as did Marsh 
or Murdock; in fact, his reading of the German text was 
begun at Carlyle’s solicitation only after the publica- 
tion of Nature, and was confined largely to Goethe, of 
whom he ‘‘contrived to read almost every volume.’’ 
Now, although these men may have first brought Emer- 
son into direct contact with the Germans, he expressly 
refutes the implication that he was more of an inter- 
preter of Coleridge than an original thinker. And al- 
though he had gained some knowledge of the Germans, 
he lets it be known that it was not merely in an imitative 
way. While Murdock utilized Tenneman to compile his 
own historical narrative of the progress of speculative 
philosophy in modern times, Emerson exclaims that 
“the whole value of opinions like Tenneman’s is to in- 
erease my self-trust by demonstrating what man can be 
and do.’’ And, lastly, although in the crucial essay on 
Nature he had apostrophized the Germany of mystic
-P-A-G-E-179
  THE SOURCES OF TRANSCENDENTALISM 171 
philosophy, he now exclaims: ‘‘ Leave me alone; do not 
teach me out of Leibniz or Schelling, and I shall find it 
all out myself.’’ 
Emerson’s son also bears testimony of him, that 
in his eighteenth year he was delighted with the 
saying that all goes back to the ancient Hast, yet 
for modern systematic metaphysics he cared little and 
seldom read. That characteristic American attitude 
of independence (despite the initial admission that 
none escapes the debt to past thought), is borne out by 
this supplementary statement from the essay on Quota- 
tion and Originality: ‘‘ To all that can be said of the 
preponderance of the Past, the single word Genius is a 
sufficient answer. The Divine resides in the new; and 
the Divine never quotes, but is, and creates. . . . Origi- 
nality is being one’s self; genius is sensibility and 
capacity of receiving just impressions from the external 
world, and the power of codrdinating these after the 
laws of thought. If the thinker recognizes the perpetual 
suggestion of the Supreme Intellect, the oldest thoughts 
become new and fertile whilst he speaks them.’’

CHAPTER VII 
EVOLUTIONISM 
  1. Tue ForERUNNERS OF EVOLUTIONISM 
Tue three centuries of American thought present three 
phases of the doctrine of evolution. To summarize these 
phases we may conveniently use the Comtean formula of 
the law of the three stages. In the seventeenth century 
the interest was theological: evolution—if such it may be 
ealled—was an unfolding of the divine plan according 
to the mere good pleasure of the Most High. In the 
eighteenth the interest was metaphysical: the divine 
plan became rationalized, evidences of design were dili- 
gently sought after, man’s task was to discover God’s 
ways of working in the world. In the nineteenth the 
interest became positive: only after theology and tele- 
ology had been left behind was it possible to fasten atten- 
tion on evolution in the stricter modern sense of epi- 
genesis, of the origin of species, of the descent of man. 
In brief, the history of evolution in America, as in Eu- 
rope, has been from the cosmic to the organic, has 
passed through the logical phases from supernatural 
election to natural selection. 
As in other speculative movements the development 
of the doctrine of evolution exhibits a parallel growth 
with that abroad. This does not imply a slavish adher- 
ence to foreign opinion, but a common pedigree and a 
common logical sequence. There is a continuity of 
thought in one case as in the other, but that continuity, 
‘ 172
-P-A-G-E-181
THE FORERUNNERS OF EVOLUTIONISM 173 
on this side of the water, has not yet been traced in 
its entirety. 
In the beginning there is, of course, great indebted- 
ness to former suggestors. Here the Greeks lead. Aris- 
totle, though confounded with the Scholastics, and ranted 
against by such pious worthies as Cotton Mather, traced 
the first faint lines which subsequent speculation was 
to follow. Edwards and Emerson were especially influ- 
enced by the Stagirite, and the later theologians, like 
the earlier Christian fathers, depended upon Hellenic 
speculation to reconcile the Mosaic account of creation 
with the growing naturalistic explanations. Some time 
before the appearance of Darwinism men like President 
Hitchcock and Tayler Lewis and Arnold Guyot did 
much in the attempt to reconcile Genesis and geology, to 
show the harmony between the revealed and the rational. 
The outburst of controversy upon the appearance of the 
Origin of Species in 1859 was, therefore, no unexpected 
thing. An earlier generation had been storing the pow- 
der to be exploded in the battles of the 60s. Here the 
scientists were the chief sappers, and ran long galleries 
of.anticipated objections. So when the theory of natural 
selection had gained its adherents, the supernaturalists 
were ready for them. The battle was extended and furi- 
ous. Southward from Harvard to William and Mary 
College, westward from New York to St. Louis, there 
was a continuous campaign of scientific controversy 
which lasted even longer than the civil strife which rent 
the country. The echoes of that conflict still reverberate, 
and in the remoter fortresses of tradition like the Pres- 
byterian Review and the Bibliotheca Sacra the garrisons 
have not yet pulled down the flag. In brief, from the 
day of Puritanism to the day of pragmatism there have 
been so many skirmishes, battles, and general engage- 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  
  174 EVOLUTIONISM 
ments as almost to merit the name of the warfare be- 
tween evolution and revelation in America. 
In the history of this warfare there are two main 
periods. Adopting the distinction of Lord Bacon, the 
period before 1859 may be called that of anticipation; 
after that crucial date, that of interpretation. In the 
first men sought for evidences of design, and design was 
an assumed general principle, and facts were, in large 
measure, made to fit the theory. In the second period 
induction was increasingly used; facts were sought for 
their own sake, and theory, or the framing of an hy- 
pothesis out of the bits furnished by the sciences, was a 
more cautious and hesitating procedure. It is no cause 
for astonishment that an inevitable conflict was to be 
expected. Between the men of deduction and the men 
of induction there was a clash of temperaments which 
was bound to throw out sparks. The men of the first 
period, who followed the high a priori road, were men of 
imagination; they beheld visions of cosmic order and 
divine purpose. The men of the second period, who 
kept to the narrow paths of careful experimentation, 
were not particularly interested in absolute order and 
supreme purpose. They were empiricists, not tran- 
scendentalists, and gloried as much in the humility of 
their tasks as their opponents did in the grandeur of 
their speculations. The transcendentalists and super- 
naturalists looked with scorn upon the grubbers after 
detail, and charged them with not seeing the beauty 
of the forest for the study of the trees. The empiricists 
and naturalists, in turn, felt it no disparagement that 
they should ‘‘ creep by timid steps and slow, on plain 
experience lay foundation low.’’ 
Let us take up the first period, that of deduction, of 
pure speculation, of high imagination, From Edwards
-P-A-G-E-183
  THE FORERUNNERS OF EVOLUTIONISM 175 
to Emerson there is a line of Platonizers who looked 
at the natural through the bright lens of the super- 
natural; who could meet with never a fact without gloss- 
ing it in the colors of eternity. These were the 
‘* analogy-loving souls ’’ who saw a double meaning in 
all events. When the Puritan divine ‘‘ viewed the moon 
for continuance ’’ it was the glory of the Lord shining 
before him; when the Concord sage crossed ‘‘ a bare 
common in snow puddles at twilight under a clouded 
sky ’’ it was to enjoy a perfect exhilaration. This poetic 
spirit of interpretation impregnated the New England 
mind for two hundred years. Besides the masters we 
find it in Cotton Mather’s Christian Philosopher, in 
Charles Chauncy and his Benevolence of the Deity; 
and in the Alvord professorship at Harvard, whose 
avowed purpose was to show the coincidence between 
the doctrines of revelation and the dictates of reason. 
Bred in the bone, this Platonizing instinct came out 
in all the acts of life. Its holders sought to hitch their 
wagons to stars, to drive them according to divine design. 
But their aims were so high that as men they became, at 
times, unpractical, and fell an easy prey to those who 
merely followed their own noses and were guided by 
common sense. It might be shown how they floundered 
in the seven seas of new facts furnished by the scientists, 
but this is a sight upon which it is not fair to dwell. In 
the change from a pessimistic theology to an optimistic 
theodicy we can sympathize with Cotton Mather’s en- 
thusiasm over the ‘‘ nice provisions of nature in the 
vegetable race,’’ based, as it was, in the plastic capacities 
of nature as governed by an all-wise agent. This belief, 
in fact, furnished the way out of the maze of determin- 
ism. Indeed it was but a step from the old Puritanic 
faith in arbitrary interferences to the deistic conviction 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
176 EVOLUTIONISM 
  that God does not act by interposition continually re- 
peated, but by concurring in an established course of 
nature. It was this distinction between interference 
and concurrence that later allowed Asa Gray to meet 
the storm of opposition raised by the doctrine of natural 
selection. By utilizing the concourse of second causes 
he claimed that morphology and teleology—things as 
they were formed and things as they were foreordained 
—were to be harmonized, since the doctrine of specific 
creation was to give way to the larger principle of 
design. 
This distinction was unfortunately forgotten. Gray 
complains of the absurdity of associating design only 
with miracle, for this association was one which did much 
to hinder the acceptance of Darwinism. At this point 
the Harvard botanist might well have appealed to those 
Dudleian lecturers who, in his own college, had been 
aiming to prove that ‘‘ the structure and constitution of 
the world and the accurate adjustment of its various 
parts prove an intelligent, wise, and good Cause.’? But 
the argument for design became confused with the doc- 
trine of special creation, and the latter was one of those 
presuppositions which hindered the acceptance of a 
naturalistic view of evolution. The confusion was worse 
confounded by the attempts to harmonize Genesis and 
geology. In this the American exegetes were not such 
literalists as the English. The Hutchinsonian school, 
which held that the Scriptures contain a complete sys- 
tem of natural philosophy, had little vogue in the land. 
Benjamin Franklin, for example, complained that such 
a manner of philosophizing was much out of his way. 
But the psycho-theological school had some followers. 
As early as 1811 Thomas Dobson declared that the geo- 
logical discoveries, which seem to indicate a much longer
-P-A-G-E-185
  THE FORERUNNERS OF EVOLUTIONISM 177 
duration of the earth than six thousand years, are not 
inconsistent with the Mosaic history because the word 
creation means not creating out of nothing, but putting 
the chaotic world with its furniture in the beautiful 
order in which it is arranged. Again, as late as 1852, 
we find in President Hitchcock’s Religion and Geology 
the acceptance of the theory that the six days of creation 
were but six continuous pictures that were made to 
pass before the vision of Moses. This kinetoscopic cos- 
mology has its absurd side, but along with the ludicrous 
there was a certain logical framework discoverable in the 
scheme. It had these three factors: special creation, 
permanence of species, cataclysmic destruction. In other 
words, that which the Almighty had been pleased to 
create, remained fixed, until it was again his good pleas- 
ure to destroy. As if after the analogy of man who was 
created perfect, then fell, and was lastly punished by 
death as the universal law, so each organic species is 
created by special dispensation of the deity, then allowed 
to develop up to certain limits, and finally swept away 
in a vast catastrophe, the “ platforms of death” por- 
trayed by Hugh Miller in his Footsteps of the Creator. 
Now this scheme of supernaturalism had, as its counter- 
part, the scheme of naturalism which had sprung up in 
the century preceding Darwin. Against special creation 
there was put spontaneous generation; against perma- 
nence of species, mutability; against cataclysmic de- 
struction, degradation through disuse. 
To trace the differences between these two schemes 
and the gradual displacement of the former by the latter, 
is to trace a sort of philosophic ‘‘ fault,’’ a metaphysical 
cleavage which occurs where the pressure is greatest. 
The last of these factors we may dispose of at once be- 
cause it destroyed itself by its very exaggeration.
-P-A-G-E-186
178 EVOLUTIONISM 
  Cataclysmiec destruction was a sort of a French Revolu- 
tion in nature, a transfer of political disasters to the 
realm of the different natural kingdoms. As one of its 
advocates declared: earth has its tempests as well as the 
ocean; there are reserved without doubt in the destinies 
of nature fearful epochs for the ravage of human races, 
and there are times marked on the divine calendar for 
the ruin of empires and for the periodic renewal of the 
mundane features. 
We return to the first factor, the first point of pres- 
sure in the new line of cleavage. This was spontaneous 
generation. That meant briefly that life is inherent in 
matter and under certain favorable conditions will 
burst forth into active being. This point was contro- 
verted by the cautious Hitchcock, who declares that not 
many years since the equivocal or casual production 
of ‘‘ animalculi,’’ without any other parentage than 
“law,’’ was thought to be made out by a multitude 
of facts; but now the advocates of this ‘‘ law ’’ hypoth- 
esis have been fairly driven from this stronghold of 
their argument. This theory, he continues, was first 
drawn out by the French zodlogists, who endeavored to 
show by the inherent vitality of some parts of matter, 
how the first or lowest classes of animals and plants may 
have been produced; and how from these, by the theory 
of development and the force of circumstances, all the 
higher animals, with their instincts and intellects, may 
have been evolved. 
The second point of pressure was mutability, or the 
gradual transmutation of species into one another 
through natural causes. This doctrine came very near 
being reached by an early Princetonian. In his notable 
Essay on the Causes of the Variety of Complexion and 
Figure in the Human Species, Stanhope Smith, as early 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  THE FORERUNNERS OF EVOLUTIONISM 179 
as 1787, virtually accepted the Lamarckian principle of 
the origin of variations from the factors of use and dis- 
use, food, climate, or the effort of the individual. The 
varieties of human nature, he contends, are to be ex- 
plained by the known operations of natural causes and 
the necessary laws of the material world, such as climate, 
the state of society, and the manner of living. Particu- 
lar differences are small. It is the example of the whole 
that surprises us by its magnitude. The combined effect 
of many minute varieties, like the product arising from 
the multiplication of many small numbers, appears great 
and unaccountable. . . . Human nature being much 
more pliant than animal, and affected by the greater 
variety of causes from food, clothing, lodging, and 
manners, is still more easily susceptible to change, ac- 
cording to any general standard, or idea, of the human 
form. To this principle, as well as to the manner of 
living, it may be in great part attributed that the Ger- 
mans, the Swedes, and the French, in different parts of 
the United States, who live chiefly among themselves, 
and cultivate the habits and ideas of the countries from 
which they emigrated, retain, even in our climate, a 
strong resemblance to their primitive stock. Those, on 
the other hand, who have not confined themselves to the 
contracted circle of their countrymen, but have mingled 
freely with the Anglo-Americans, entered into their 
manners, and adopted their ideas, have assumed such a 
likeness to them, that it is not easy now to distinguish 
from one another people who sprung from such different 
origins. . . . So, in proportion as the citizens of the 
States approach the vicinity of the Indian tribes, simi- 
larity of situation produces also a great approximation 
of manners; they decline the labors of agriculture as a 
toil and prefer the fatigues of hunting to all other pleas-
-P-A-G-E-188
180 EVOLUTIONISM 
ures, and the charms of indolence and independence to 
the refinements and attractions of civil society. 
In Stanhope Smith there was a certain advance over 
the old way of thinking: the old held that species were 
adapted by the Creator, the new that they were created 
adaptable. But while this adaptability is a step toward 
a naturalistic view, unfortunately for the purely scien- 
tifie aspect of his acute observations the Princetonian 
gives a supernaturalistic turn to his arguments. The 
flexibility which he concedes is but fractional compared 
with the fixity of the species; it is only a principle of 
pliancy given to divinely endowed primitive man, in 
order that he may be capable of accommodation to every 
situation in the globe. 
As an early American ethnologist Stanhope Smith 
had great opportunities, but an unfettered doctrine of 
mutability was impossible because of his prior belief in 
special creation. Hence for a full quarter of a century 
the doctrine of mutability lay undeveloped in native 
thought. But in 1813 William Charles Wells wrote a 
paper on the Formation of Races, which had the dis- 
tinction of being favorably spoken of by Charles Dar- 
win in his Historical Sketch of his forerunners. Refer- 
ring to man’s selective action regarding domesticated 
animals Wells gives this pregnant passage: ‘‘ But what 
is here done by art seems to be done with equal efficacy 
though more slowly by nature, in the formation of 
varieties of mankind fitted for the country which they 
inhabit.’? The paper of Wells was so little known that 
Morton, the Philadelphia craniologist, could declare that 
nothing was done in ethnology in the United States be- 
tween Stanhope Smith and himself. So Morton re- 
counts how, at the commencement of his study in 1824, 
he was taught that all mankind were derived from a 
   
-P-A-G-E-189
THE FORERUNNERS OF EVOLUTIONISM 181 
  single pair, and that diversity, now so remarkable, origi- 
nated solely from the operations of climate, locality, 
food, and other physical agents. Yet Morton is satisfied 
with neither of these views—the old or the new—neither 
the special creation of the literalist, nor the mutability 
of the transformationist. The ordinary exposition of 
Genesis is declared impossible: that all human races are 
of some one species and one family is contradicted by 
their present variations. Again that all mankind were 
derived from a single pair, and that the diversities now 
so remarkable originated solely from physical operations, 
would demand indefinite periods,—those chiliads of 
years which Prichard came to advocate. . . . It cannot 
be that chance, alone, has caused all the physical dis- 
parity among men from the noblest Caucasian form to 
the most degraded Australian and Hottentot. There- 
fore one must conclude that these diversities are not 
acquired, but have existed ab origine. 
In attempting to avoid the difficulties both of uniform 
creation and purely natural transmutation Morton takes 
a mediating view. He favors a doctrine of primeval 
diversities among men,—an original adaptation of the 
several races to those varied circumstances of climate 
and locality which, while congenial to the one, are de- 
structive to the other. On the surface, this use of the 
word adaptation might lead to the inference that Mor- 
ton advocates natural selection. Such is not the case. 
His adaptation is supernatural, not natural. It affirms 
that diversity among animals is a fact determined by 
the will of the Creator. It denies the competency of 
physical causes to produce the effect alleged. It is, 
therefore, not to be interpreted as approaching a theory 
of mutation. It may be pointed out how close were these 
views to those of Agassiz. In fact Morton’s definition
-P-A-G-E-190
  182 EVOLUTIONISM 
of species as primordial forms, prepared the way for 
the promulgation of the kindred theory of the Swiss 
naturalist, as he expressed it later in his introduc- 
tion to Morton’s own Types of Mankind. Morton’s 
views were spread in the South through his pupil, 
Knott of Mobile. They came to a curious use at the 
hands of the politician, John C. Calhoun, who argues 
that if all men had a common origin, whites and blacks 
would be equal; but there has been a plurality of origins, 
and one of these primordial varieties was the negro, who 
was originally created the inferior of the Caucasian; 
therefore, between whites and blacks there is no real 
equality. 
In contrast with such special pleading and in logical 
connection with the paper of Wells, are the conjectures 
of Haldeman and Leidy on the possibilities of natural 
variation. It was the former who declared: Although we 
may not be able artificially to produce a change beyond 
a given point, it would be a hasty inference to suppose 
that a physical agent, acting gradually for ages, would 
not carry the variation a step or two farther, so that 
instead of the original (we will say) four varieties, they 
might amount to six, the sixth being sufficiently unlike 
the earlier ones to induce a naturalist to consider it 
distinct. This interesting conjecture was published in 
Boston in 1843. One similar to it appeared in Phila- 
delphia in 1850. Joseph Leidy, the paleontologist, as- 
serted: The essential conditions of life are five in num- 
ber, namely: a germ, nutritive matter, air, water, heat, 
the four latter undoubtedly existing in the interior of 
all animals. The result is that very slight modifica- 
tions of these essential conditions of life are sufficient 
to produce the vast variety of living beings upon the 
globe.  
-P-A-G-E-191
  THE FORERUNNERS OF EVOLUTIONISM 183 
There are none so blind as those who will not see. 
Here were two fruitful suggestions which lay prac- 
tically forgotten until the appearance of the Origin of 
Species. This neglect was calamitous, yet the inability to 
grasp the significance of these naturalistic arguments 
was not without reason. The preformationists were in 
the majority and were still thinking in terms of the 
Platonic archetypes. There still lingered in their mind 
the Leibnizian conception of a great chain of being 
which binds together into a single system the past and 
present epochs of organic life. This doctrine of descent 
according to the analogy of the chain, precluded that 
of growth according to the analogy of the tree, the true 
tree of evolution with its many collateral branches 
springing from some single internal principle. And so 
until the appearance of Asa Gray, defender of Darwin, 
there was this great hindrance to the doctrine of organic 
evolutionism,—a preference for transcendence over im- 
manence. Just as the Aristotelian scale of being had 
fallen in with the Puritanic doctrine of predestination, 
so now, among the descendants of Puritans, there was a 
difficulty in passing from the conception of special 
creation of species, fixed by fiat, to that of the continu- 
ous manifestation of the divine activities as shown in an 
orderly unfolding of the universe. In fine, tradition’s 
rigid programme, an intellectual imposition upon matter 
of what should evolve from it, was opposed to nature’s 
having any part in initiating variations, in originating 
novelties. In a word, the fiat of the Creator is set over 
against any conception of creative evolution, in the 
sense of the self-sufficiency of the universe, and this 
rendered difficult the reception of Darwinism. That 
reception was now rendered doubly difficult by the in- 
trusion of a foreign force.

2. THe ANTAGONISM OF AGASSIZ 
The coming of Louis Agassiz in 1846 was hailed with 
delight in the camp of the preformationists and super- 
naturalists, because the revival of Lamarck’s naturalism 
threatened the old guard with defeat. But now as at 
Waterloo help came from the East, and Agassiz, like an- 
other Bliicher, turned the tide of battle. The reénforce- 
ment consisted in the Swiss naturalist’s importation of 
his master’s views, for it was from Cuvier that he had 
derived the fixed ideas of immutability of species, 
special creation, and cataclysmic destruction. And so 
because he brought in these reénforcements from the 
flank Agassiz received a warm welcome at the hands of 
the reactionary scientists and likewise at the hands of 
the populace. It was not only because of his sanguine 
personality, that, to use his own phrase, he became ‘‘ the 
spoilt child of the country,’’ but because his convictions 
fell in with those of an essentially conservative democ- 
racy. Evolution in the sense of physical derivation was 
identified with materialism, and materialism to the 
groundlings meant atheism. To all this Agassiz fur- 
nished an antidote. Believing that the order in the 
cosmos depends upon intellectual coherence, not ma- 
terial connections, he asked if the divisions of the animal 
kingdom have not been instituted by the Divine Intelli- 
gence as the categories of his mode of thinking, and, if 
this be so, whether we do not find in this adaptability 
of the human intellect to the facts of creation the most 
conclusive proof of an affinity with the Divine Mind? 
That which was put as a query became so fixed a 
dogma that Agassiz could assure a committee of the 
Massachusetts Legislature visiting his museum, that in 
the future generations there would not be a child who
-P-A-G-E-193
  THE ANTAGONISM OF AGASSIZ 185 
would not have the opportunity of understanding the 
scheme of creation as thoroughly as he understood his 
multiplication table. Now, the public liked such an as- 
sertion. It pointed out an easy road to learning. It also 
fell in with their views of a benevolent Providence, who 
from the very dawn of creation saw to it that this world 
should be arranged for the benefit of man. Thus the 
tenets of intelligibility and benevolence were two strings 
with which Agassiz worked the public. The same tenets 
were not without influence upon the conservative sci- 
entists. These he utilized in that famous Essay on 
Classification in his widely sold Natural History of the 
United States. He also utilized them in his persistent 
attacks on Darwin. In his review of the Origin of 
Species he repeats his favorite formula that order in the 
organic world consists in intellectual coherence, not 
material connection. Otherwise it would be impossible 
to show that branches in the animal kingdom are founded 
upon different plans of structure, patterns of form, 
categories of thought existing in the divine mind and, 
therefore, intelligently and methodically combined in 
all parts. 
At this point it may be interesting to inquire why the 
arguments presented by Darwin in favor of a universal 
derivation from one primary form, made, as Agassiz con- 
fessed, not the slightest impression on his mind. The 
reason may be discovered earlier in his life than his 
biographers suggest. For many years back, he declared, 
he lost no opportunity of urging the idea that while 
species have no material existence, they yet exist as 
categories of thought in the mind of the Creator. Now 
what is the ultimate source of this belief? It is found 
in Agassiz’s defense of his old teacher Oken and the 
physio-philosophical systems based on Schelling. So
-P-A-G-E-194
  186 EVOLUTIONISM 
when it is recalled that in his youth Agassiz listened to 
Schelling and that Schelling was a Platonizer, much of 
the type of Emerson, one can understand the popularity 
of such views when they were freshly imported into 
America. It was not so much that Emerson knew some- 
thing of the speculations of Schelling and Oken from 
Coleridge, but that he was a constitutional Platonizer 
who believed in the intelligibility of the world as due to 
the essential identity of the operations of the human 
and divine intellect. This transcendental opinion was 
one of the medley held by Agassiz. From it he inferred 
that the world is not due to the working of blind forces, 
but is the creation of a reflective mind establishing de- 
liberately all the categories we recognize in nature, and 
combining them in that wonderful harmony which 
unites all things into such a perfect system. In defense 
of what he acknowledges to be a priori conceptions relat- 
ing to nature, Agassiz falls back upon One Supreme 
Intelligence, Author of all things, by whose almighty fiat 
all animals, with all their peculiarities, were created upon 
the general plan of structure of the great type to which 
they belong. Here the Swiss zodlogist talks like a Platon- 
izing Puritan. He goes even further in his reaction 
against naturalism. As to the origin of existing animals 
and plants he presents for consideration three theories: 
spontaneous generation; the action of the established 
laws of matter; the immediate intervention of an in- 
telligent Creator. Of these three Agassiz boldly advo- 
cates the last because the first is not proven, and the 
second would stultify his postulate and preclude design. 
Granted that the four different plans of structure ex- 
hibited in the animal kingdom illustrate four great 
primordial ideas, then, unless the physical agents at 
work in the early days of the existence of our globe 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
  
THE ANTAGONISM OF AGASSIZ 187 
could have devised such plans, and impressed them upon 
the material world as the pattern upon which nature was 
to build forever afterwards, no such general relations 
as exist among all animals could ever have existed. 
In his recoil from naturalism Agassiz has gone to such 
an extreme of supernaturalism as to have lost those 
very arguments for design in the constituted laws of na- 
ture, so skillfully employed by the deists. At the hands 
of such a reactionary the earlier arguments, therefore, 
fall to the ground. Intelligibility and intervention are 
mutually exclusive. One makes the world comprehen- 
sible, the other incomprehensible. When the rational 
conceptions fail, it is necessary to call in the help of the 
deity. The argument is again put in the form of a 
query: There are certain extraordinary changes which 
one and the same animal may undergo during different 
periods of its life;—does not this prove directly the 
immediate intervention of a power capable of control- 
ling all these external conditions, as well as regulating 
the course of life of every being? To attack such a posi- 
tion those who would deny the intervention in nature of 
a creative mind must show that the cause to which they 
refer the origin of finite beings is by its nature a pos- 
sible cause, which cannot be denied of a being endowed 
with the attributes which we recognize in God. 
With such an outward creed Agassiz came into a 
country where the deists had won the day in behalf of 
the rationality of the constituted laws of nature. It is 
little wonder that, when the master repudiated his 
primary principles, his followers should go over to the 
new views. This explains why Agassiz’s pupils sur- 
rendered in a body to Darwinism. In the first place, they 
found their leader’s immutable classifications constantly 
changing; then they discovered that he did not under-  
-P-A-G-E-196
188 EVOLUTIONISM 
  stand the bearing of his own laws; and lastly they found 
that these laws fitted into the new scheme better than 
into the old. Agassiz’s great idea of the identity of 
the three series—structural, individual, racial—really 
favored naturalism at the expense of supernaturalism. 
To neglect second causes and refer organic changes di- 
rectly to a first cause—the plans of the Creator—made 
this triple identity unnatural, unreasonable, dependent 
on the mere whim of the Almighty. It was an impossible 
position that Agassiz took that, since species exist as 
thoughts, and individuals as facts, there was no material 
connection between the latter. To base common descent 
on formal grounds and at the same time to exclude a 
physical differentiation of the objects themselves, was 
merely to make a plan of a picture and never to use the 
actual pigments. Indeed Agassiz seemed incapable of 
filling in the figures, of blending the whole into a con- 
tinuous canvas. He postulates his four plans of struc- 
ture, but denies that they are transmutable the one into 
the other. In a word, his was a static, not a dynamic 
conception; his cosmos a prearranged programme, not 
a spontaneous growth. So he inveighs against natural 
selection as a misnomer, since selection implies design 
and the powers to which Darwin refers the orders of 
species can design nothing. 
It was this insistence on the ancient form of the argu- 
ment for design that enabled Asa Gray to turn some of 
Agassiz’s own guns against him. Those natural divisions 
which to the latter existed only as categories of thought 
in the supreme intelligence, and were of an independent 
existence and unvarying as thought itself, Gray put into 
the ordering processes of the universe. In other words, 
that which had been a static, transcendent postulate now 
becomes a dynamic, immanent principle. To Gray this
-P-A-G-E-197
  THE ANTAGONISM OF AGASSIZ 189 
was not the exclusion of the supernatural, but its inclu- 
sion in the natural. No longer do species endure in a 
subjective and ideal sense, but they are interrelated by 
an objective inheritance from a common stock. In short, 
the adamantine chain of foreordination is replaced by 
the living tree of genetic descent. In this way the ma- 
terial, against which Agassiz inveighed, is turned inside 
out and shown to be interwoven with purpose. Thus 
Gray criticises Agassiz’s review of Darwin and contends 
that the Origin of Species is not atheistic, since a ma- 
terial connection between the members of a series of 
organized beings is not inconsistent with the idea of their 
being intellectually connected with one another through 
the deity. Agassiz is theistic to excess because the 
Creator is put so supremely above his creation. The way 
out of the apparent difficulty of lack of design is, there- 
fore, to regard the intervention of the deity ‘‘ not so 
much as done for all time, as doing through all time.”’ 
Whether such an interpretation was a proper imma- 
nent theism, or a perilous approach to pantheism, may 
be judged better when we take up other of Darwin’s 
reviewers. Meanwhile it remains to be shown how the 
appearance of the Origin of Species, instead of modify- 
ing Agassiz’s beliefs, tended to fix them. A favorite 
disciple acknowledged that it was a special characteristic 
of Agassiz’s mind, intensified by the teaching of his 
great master Cuvier, seldom to acknowledge an error, 
but, on the contrary, to try by all means to maintain his 
position. That characteristic now became prominent. 
At the meetings of the American Academy of Science and 
of the Natural History Society of Boston in 1860, he 
raised the sharpest objections against the acceptance of 
Darwin’s theory, which he considered a ‘‘ mania to be 
outlived.’’ This was before the scientists. Before the  
-P-A-G-E-198
  190 EVOLUTIONISM 
public he again brought his views in his Methods of Study 
in Natural History, declaring that there was a repulsive 
poverty in this material explanation that is contradicted 
by the intellectual grandeur of the universe. Finally, in 
a posthumous article appearing in the Atlantic Monthly, 
he left a scientific last will and testament in which he 
reiterated the convictions which he had brought into the 
country. In this document there are three salient sec- 
tions: First, that the law of evolution keeps types within 
appointed cycles of growth which revolve forever upon 
themselves; second, that the argument of Darwin is 
purely negative, resting upon the assumption that transi- 
tion types have dropped out from the geological record; 
and lastly, that Darwinians are reluctant to grant inter- 
vention of an intellectual power in the diversity which 
obtains in nature, under the plea that such an admission 
implies distinct creative acts for every species. 
In the first of these tenets Agassiz goes back to the 
nature-philosophy of his youth, takes evolution in the 
literal sense of an unrolling of an absolute, and sug- 
gests, if he does not borrow, the cyclic processes of Vico. 
This is historically consistent, for the doctrine of a recur- 
ring cosmic process has often been bound up with the 
scheme of preformation. That the argument of Darwin 
is negative is not so well taken. Agassiz indeed insisted 
on the interrelations of the three series—structural, em- 
bryonic, geologic—for the sake of the light that each 
sheds on the other. Now, the first of these series presumes 
the existence of the third, for embryonic growth was a 
positive suggestion that the geologic succession was not 
discontinuous, and this Agassiz’s immediate successors 
discovered. In the last objection there was more weight. 
The young and ardent spirits of the day were reluctant 
to grant intervention, as it seemed to carry the doctrine 
 
-P-A-G-E-199
  THE RECEPTION OF DARWINISM 191 
of design to an extreme. Thus Agassiz’s colleague, Asa 
Gray, reported the Lowell Lectures as being planned 
upon high ground and yet with a certain animus against 
Lamarck and the Vestiges. Likewise Agassiz’s pupil, 
Joseph Le Conte, interpreted the master’s writings as 
aimed to uphold a designed development, and yet one not 
by organic forces within, but according to an intelligent 
plan without,—an evolution not by transmutation of 
species, but by substitution of one species by another. 
We leave Agassiz with his last will and testament,— 
a stumbling-block in the path of philosophical progress. 
We turn to his colleague and counterpart, Asa Gray, who 
did more than any single native writer to hasten the re- 
ception of Darwinism. 
3. THE RecEPTion or DARWINISM 
In Asa Gray we have the New World’s most efficient 
defender of Darwinism after the appearance of the 
Origin of Species in 1859. The Harvard botanist con- 
fesses himself a convinced theist with no prepossession in 
favor of naturalistic theories. Nevertheless he says that 
within half a generation it can be affirmed that the gen- 
eral doctrine of the derivation of species has prevailed 
over that of specific creation, and this in spite of the 
fact that so many of the reviewers attack the Origin as 
pantheistic, if not atheistic. In his first review of 
March, 1860, he writes that ‘‘ this book is exciting much 
attention ’’ and that already two American editions are 
announced. He foresees a spirited conflict among opin- 
ions of every grade,—a struggle for existence in which 
natural selection itself will destroy the weaker and allow 
the stronger to survive. Such conflicting opinions are 
those of Dana of Yale, whose idealistic Thoughts upon
-P-A-G-E-200
192 EVOLUTIONISM 
  Species will not readily harmonize with the naturalistic 
scheme, and those of Agassiz, who widely diverges from 
Darwinism. 
Gray now draws an instructive parallel between the 
views of the Swiss-American and those of the English- 
man in order to bring out the main features of the theory 
of the origination of species by means of natural selec- 
tion. While Agassiz discards the idea of common de- 
scent as the real bond of union among the individuals 
and holds that each species originated at the same time 
over the whole geographical area it occupies, Darwin 
holds the orthodox view of the descent of all the indi- 
viduals of a species not only from a local birthplace, but 
from a single ancestor or pair. He adds that each species 
has extended and established itself, through natural 
agencies, wherever it could; so that the actual geo- 
graphical distribution of any species is by no means a 
primordial arrangement, but a natural result. 
By the ‘‘ orthodox ’’ rule of descent, Gray evidently 
meant the Bible view, since the theory of a plurality of 
centers of origin lent itself to the common American be- 
lief in the possibility of special creation in order to 
repair the ravages of cataclysms. If, now, we substitute 
for the word orthodox the word current, we see that 
Agassiz had the people on his side. His theory, con- 
tinues Gray, referring the phenomena both of origin 
and distribution directly to the divine will, both being 
equally primordial, equally supernatural, and also up- 
holding that every adaptation of species to climate and 
of species to species, is as aboriginal and, therefore, inex- 
plicable as are the organic forms themselves,—this theory 
is theistic to excess. The opposite theory is not open 
to this objection. The question of primordial origin may 
be left in abeyance, but geographical distribution is not  
-P-A-G-E-201
  
THE RECEPTION OF DARWINISM 193 
a primordial arrangement but a natural result. More- 
over, adaptation is a phenomenon according to which 
plants and animals are subject from their birth to phys- 
ical influences, to which they have to accommodate them- 
selves as they can. Is it not possible to harmonize these 
two theories, if the former makes the unity of plan only 
intellectual, and the latter makes inheritance material? 
In other words, is it not most presumable that an intel- 
lectual conception realized in nature would be realized 
through physical agencies? To Gray the compromise 
between theological views and physical causation seems 
not impossible. When Agassiz refers the whole to the 
agency of intellect as its first cause and when Darwin 
does not deny an intellectual connection between species 
—as related to a supreme intelligence—Gray dimly ap- 
prehends a probable combination of these divergent 
theories, and in that combination the ground for a strong 
stand against ‘‘ mere naturalism.’’ 
In this last phrase the compromiser is really not one- 
sided. The proof that he does not take a stand against 
the natural is that he is opposed to the exclusively super- 
natural. Thus he adds that substantive proof of specific 
creation is not attainable, but that of derivation or trans- 
mutation of species may be. The propounders of the 
latter view are bound to do one of two things: either to 
assign real and adequate causes, the natural or necessary 
‘esult of which must be to produce the present diversity 
of species and their actual relations; or, to show the 
general conformity of the whole body of facts to such 
assumption through its competency to harmonize all the 
facts. Lamarck mainly undertook the first line, but his 
doctrine of appetencies and habits of animals reacting 
upon their structure met with a somewhat undeserved 
ridicule. The shadowy author of the Vestiges of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
  
  194 EVOLUTIONISM 
Natural History of Creation can hardly be said to have 
undertaken either line, in a scientific way. He would 
explain the whole progressive evolution of nature by 
virtue of an inherent tendency to develop, thus giving 
us an idea or a word in place of a natural cause, a 
restatement of the proposition instead of an explana- 
tion. Darwin attempts both lines of proof and in a 
strictly scientific spirit. 
Nothing could have been more fortunate than this 
presentation of the case. It disarmed criticism of the 
naturalistic hypothesis by throwing the burden of proof 
upon the propounder. It allowed for a sufficient margin 
of deistic interpretation to satisfy the supernaturalists. 
Darwin, in proposing a theory which suggests a method 
that harmonizes these facts, into a system we may trust, 
implies that all was done wisely, in the largest sense 
designedly, and by an intelligent First Cause. Gray 
expressed trust in Darwin’s deistic drift through the lat- 
ter’s allowing Paley’s argument a further extension, and 
through his changing the meaning of the intervention of 
the Creator as done for all time, to an intervention as 
doing through all time. 
It is possible that Gray strains a point in trying to ac- 
commodate Darwinism to the traditional Anglo-American 
philosophy. Yet he makes full allowance for the diffi- 
culties in the way of the acceptance of the new theory. 
The first difficulty is the imperfection of the geological 
records. Of the records of fossil lithography all but the 
last volume is out of print, and of its pages only local 
glimpses have been obtained. But for these gaps, we 
need not ‘‘ invoke cataclysm to involve the world,’’ for 
the theory of uniformity will account for all geological 
changes in a quiet and easy way. The second difficulty 
is that of the ‘‘ missing link.’’ Wide is the gap between
-P-A-G-E-203
  THE RECEPTION OF DARWINISM 195 
the highest quadrumana and man; but where is there the 
slightest evidence of a common progenitor? In evolution 
the prospect of the future is encouraging; but the back- 
ward glance alarming. There may be a closer associa- 
tion of our ancestors of the olden time with ‘‘ our poor 
relations ’’ of the quadrumanous family than we like to 
acknowledge. But the whole argument in natural theol- 
ogy for a final cause, say in the structure of the hand, is 
just as good on the supposition of the descent of men 
from chimpanzees and gorillas as it would have been in 
the case of the first man supernaturally created. Mean- 
while intermediate links between the two-handed and the 
four-handed are lacking altogether, so we must needs 
believe in the separate and special creation of man. 
A third difficulty is that of sterility. Darwin labors 
to show that sterility is not a special endowment, to pre- 
vent the confusion of species by mingling, but an inci- 
dental acquirement. But this arrangement to keep apart 
those forms which have, or have acquired, a certain 
moderate amount of difference, looks to us as much 
designed for the purpose as does a ratchet to prevent 
reverse motion in a wheel. A fourth and a most formi- 
dable difficulty is that of the production and specializa- 
tion of organs. All organic beings have been formed on 
two great laws: unity of type, and adaptation to the 
conditions of existence. The special teleologists, such 
as Paley, occupy themselves with the latter only, refer- 
ring particular facts to special design, but leaving an 
overwhelming array of the widest facts inexplicable. The 
morphologists build on unity of type, which requires 
each individual ‘‘ to go through a certain formality,”’ 
and to accept, at least for a time, certain organs, whether 
they are of any use to him or not. If philosophers seek 
to harmonize these two views theoretically, Darwin har- 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
    196 EVOLUTIONISM | 
monizes them naturally: adaptation is the result of 
natural selection; unity of type, of unity of reason. 
In this summary statement Gray has given due weight 
to both sides of the controversy. He confessed that at 
first he had no prepossession in favor of naturalistic 
theories and that the evidence presented by Darwin had 
been so strong that he could not but give his studies the 
name of Darwiniana. 
In turning from the college at Cambridge to the col- 
lege at New Haven we find an illustration of the sarcastic 
saying that where Harvard leads Yale follows—at a dis- 
tance. In James Dwight Dana, the geologist, we have 
a preformationist who through his uniformitarian views 
came to a gradual but grudging acknowledgment of 
Darwinism. As early as 1848 Dana writes to Gray that 
the view which he had favored of late was one suggested 
by Professor Henry of Washington, who considered the 
forces in animate nature chemical forces, but also that 
there was a directrix behind all, modifying or govern- 
ing the results. He compared it to a steam engine whose 
' forces within were directed in their operation by the 
engineer. Here was a sort of deistic dynamism, the raw 
material which Dana worked over for thirty years and 
left in this finished law of development: ‘‘ Unity evolv- 
ing multiplicity of parts, to successive individualization, 
proceeding from the more fundamental onwards.”’ 
The first modification of this suggested transcendent 
dynamism was to make it partially immanent. In his 
idea of species as certain amounts or kinds of concen- 
trated force, Gray told Dana that he fell back upon the 
broadest and most fundamental views, and developed 
them with great ability and cogency. The praise is 
just. Dana’s Thoughts on Species is a clearly reasoned 
study of the comprehensive principles that pervade the

universe, with the purpose of finding out the meaning 
of permanency, and the basis of variations in species. 
In this study of 1857 the author hopes to illumine a 
subject as yet involved in doubts and difficulties, by 
reasoning from central principles to circumferential. 
From the study of the inorganic world we learn that 
each element is represented by a specific amount or law 
of force. The essential idea of species thus deduced is 
this: a species corresponds to a specific amount or con- 
dition of force, defined in the act or law of creation. But 
in organic beings, unlike the inorganic, there is a cycle 
of progress involving growth and decline. The oxygen 
molecule may be eternal as far as anything in its nature 
goes. But the germ-cell is but an incipient stage in a 
eycle of changes, and is not the same for two successive 
instants. Thus an indefinite perpetuation of the germ-cell 
is in fact effected; yet it is not mere endless being, but 
like evolving like in an unlimited round. Hence when 
individuals multiply from generation to generation, it 
is but a repetition of the primordial type-idea, and the 
true notion of species is not in the resulting group, but 
in the idea or potential element which is at the basis 
of every individual of the group. 
In Dana’s elaborate series of definitions we have sev- 
eral points of attachment with his fellow-scientists. 
The cyclic conception is that of Agassiz, while the defini- 
tion of the primordial type-idea is acknowledged to be 
nearly the same as that of Morton, when he described a 
species as a primordial organic force. But there is yet 
a difference. With Dana there is greater emphasis upon 
the immanent element in the evolutionary process. Each 
species, he continues, has its own special mode of de- 
velopment as well as ultimate form or result,—its serial 
unfolding, inworking, and outflowing. The precise na- 
 
-P-A-G-E-206

ture of the potentiality in each species is expressed by 
the line of historical progress from the germ to the full 
expansion of its power. We comprehend the type-idea 
only when we understand the cycle of evolution through 
all its laws of progress, both as regards the living struc- 
ture under development within, and its successive rela- 
tions to the external world. 
Thus far there is much that is significant in Dana’s 
essay. It has an air of novelty. In its reference to the 
influence of the external world it appears to lean to- 
ward the environmental infiuences of Darwin. Mean- 
while the Origin of Species had appeared and the doc- 
trine of variation through natural selection was rife. 
But as Dana wrote to Darwin in 1863, geology has not 
afforded facts that sustain the view that the system of 
life has been evolved through a method of development 
from species to species. Darwin, in turn, admits that 
his correspondent’s objections are perfectly valid, but he 
adds this demurrer: ‘‘ As my book has been lately some- 
how attended to, perhaps it would have been better if, 
when you condemned all such views, you had stated that 
you had not been able yet to read it. But pray do not 
suppose that I think for one instant that, with your 
strong and slowly acquired convictions and immense 
knowledge, you could have been converted. The utmost 
that I could have hoped would have been that you might 
possibly have been here or there staggered. Indeed, I 
should not much value any sudden conversion, for I re- 
member well how many years I fought against my pres- 
ent belief.’’ 
The conversion of Dana to Darwinism—if such it may 
be called—was indeed slow. A dozen years after this 
letter he insists that the transition between species, in 
the system of progress, has not yet proved to be gradual  
-P-A-G-E-207
  
THE RECEPTION OF DARWINISM 199 
and that man is not of nature’s making, but owes his 
existence to the special act of the Infinite Being whose 
image he bears. But the tide at last turned, and, twenty 
years later, naturalism and supernaturalism came to a 
compromise in his mind. As he wrote in the last and 
revised edition of his Manual of Geology, the former 
speculative conclusions are not all in accord with the 
author’s present judgment. In giving up the general 
principles with regard to the progress in the earth’s 
life—such as progress from the aquatic to the terrestrial, 
from the simple to the complex—he states that all these 
principles are in accord with a theory of evolution, and, 
through the added facts of later years, they favor the 
view of evolution by natural variation. Such added 
facts are that Arctic America contained in tertiary time 
plants so much like species existing in the forests of both 
temperate North America and Japan, that the former 
have been pronounced the undoubted progenitors of the 
latter. Also along the Pacifie Coast and Gulf Coast of 
Central America there are so many identical and nearly 
related species of aquatic animals that migration during 
a time of submergence of the narrow strip of land, with 
subsequent variation, is regarded as the only reason- 
able explanation. 
Dana’s old preformationism with its fixed types now 
gives place to great plasticity in organic structures under 
variant agencies. A telling proof here is a fossil collec- 
tion of Dana’s pupil, Marsh, exhibiting the descent of the 
horse from the primitive five-toed species to the present 
one-toed variety. This collection was a palpable proof 
to Huxley, yet Dana was never entirely won over to 
naturalism. The causes of variation mentioned by Dar- 
win are acknowledged to be real causes, but they are 
held to act directly, after the Lamarckian method, with- 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  200 EVOLUTIONISM 
out dependence for success upon the principle of natural 
selection. This theory is not essential to evolution be- 
cause it is based on the assumption that variations come 
singly or nearly so, and that the selected are, therefore, 
few compared with the multitudes that disappear. The 
idea is derived from facts recorded of domestic or culti- 
vated races whose structures are in a strained or artificial 
state and deteriorate when care ceases. But in wild na- 
ture variations are, in general, the slow and sure results 
of the conditions. When, therefore, a variation appears 
that admits of augmentation by continued inbreeding, 
progress should be general, and the unadaptable few 
should disappear, not the multitude. Man affords an ex- 
ample. The gradual gain of some races in lands and 
supremacy and the disappearance of the inferior races is 
one example of the survival of the fittest, or natural selec- 
tion. But the superior races derived the power which 
led to their survival and preéminent position through 
favoring conditions in environments, that is, in geo- 
graphical, geological, and biological conditions and re- 
sources; through the powers of endurance, and courage, 
and mind power, and will power, which conflict with na- 
ture and other races of men in the world is fitted to 
develop; and through the power of self-assurance which 
comes of a high moral sense. Hence victory, survival. 
The survival of the fittest is a fact; and the fact accounts 
in part for the geographical distribution of the races of 
men now existing and still in progress; but not for the 
existence of the fittest nor for the power that has deter- 
mined survival. 
In this half-hearted avowal of Darwinism the Yale 
geologist betrays a certain confusion on the subject. 
Asa Gray suggested such a confusion or lack of compre- 
hension when he wrote to Dana: ‘‘ Every now and then
-P-A-G-E-209
  
THE RECEPTION OF DARWINISM 201 
something you write makes me doubt if you quite get 
hold of Darwinian natural selection. . . . Suppose the 
term be a personification, as, no doubt, strictly it is. One 
so fond as you are of personification ought not to object 
to what seems to me a happy term.’’ 
The reception of Darwinism at Yale College was 
lukewarm. A similar state of affairs existed at Prince- 
ton. In President McCosh we have a treatment clear, 
candid, and incisive, but a method of approach ominous 
to scientific naturalism. The new college head tells us 
that he was not a week in Princeton till he let it be known 
to the upper classes of the college that he was in favor 
of evolution—properly limited and explained. This 
qualification is in harmony with the speaker’s previous 
words. In his first published volume, The Method of the 
Divine Government, he sought to unfold the plan by 
which God governs the world. He concedes that he 
found it in an orderly manner—that is, by law. He is 
now prepared to believe that there might be a like method 
in the organic kingdoms and to listen to Darwin when he 
showed that there was a regular instrumentality in the 
descent of plants and animals. In place, then, of undis- 
criminating denunciation of evolution from so many 
pulpits, periodicals, and seminaries, a denunciation 
which assumes evolution and Christianity incompatible, 
the Princetonian propounds a definition to harmonize the 
two: Evolution is the drawing of one thing out of an- 
other ; it proceeds from causation which is universal, for 
in the world things are so connected that every one 
thing proceeds from some other, and all things from 
God. This is the dogma. Can it be proved? Darwin is 
constantly making the distinction between natural selec- 
tion and supernatural design, between natural law and 
special creation. Now, the difference between the two  
-P-A-G-E-210
    202 EVOLUTIONISM 
opposing theories as thus put is misleading, since the 
supernatural power is to be recognized in the natural 
law, the Creator’s power being executed by the creature’s 
action, the design seen in the mechanism. Chance is 
obliged to vanish because we see contrivance. There 
is purpose when we see a beneficent end accomplished. 
So much for the preamble. Apparently the newly 
imported Scottish divine is back in the eighteenth cen- 
tury, the age of reason, which saw in all things benevo- 
lence and design. That attitude was more fully ex- 
pressed in McCosh’s joint work on Typical Forms and 
Special Ends in Creation. But he now recognizes that 
the matter is not so easy of solution. It will not do to 
Platonize. The types of the animal kingdom have been 
fondly contemplated and admired by our profounder 
minds. They have been identified with the grand ideas 
which, according to Plato, have been in or before the 
divine mind from all eternity. Pious minds like Cuvier 
have ascribed them to God, whose thoughts are embodied 
in them. On the other hand, the great rival of Cuvier, 
St. Hilaire, ascribed the types to a common descent, and 
used language which sounded as if the animal by its 
wishes could add to its organs; could call forth fins to 
swim with, and wings to fly. The controversy came to 
a head when Goethe declared that it was of more 
importance than the French Revolution. 
There is undoubtedly a difference between the two 
views; but McCosh asks if there may not be a recon- 
ciliation? It may be by descent that types are 
formed, and yet all be done by a plan in the 
‘divine wisdom which is thus manifested. The two 
great Swiss-American naturalists, Agassiz and Guyot, 
delighted to perceive clearly that there was a 
system in the descent of animals which they were
-P-A-G-E-211
  
  THE RECEPTION OF DARWINISM 203 
sure was conceived in the divine mind, but doubted 
whether it could have been produced by natural 
law or material agency. But surely, in analogy with 
divine procedure in all other parts of nature, we may 
discover a divine plan, and at the same time a creature 
‘agency to carry it out, which agency makes known God’s 
plan to us. We may see that the relations which con- 
stitute types are genetic, and as we perceive in them 
wisdom and beauty, we can also perceive that they are 
instituted by God. This view gives to classes a con- 
nection in the very nature of things, and makes species 
intelligible to human intelligence, which thereby rises to 
some comprehension of divine intelligence, in the image 
of which human intelligence is formed. 
The ground is gone over again and the same conclu- 
sion reached,—the comfortable conclusion of benevo- 
lence, design, and the human capacity to comprehend the 
cosmic purposes. Anything the scientist brings for- 
ward may be clearly beheld in this bright light of optim- 
ism. When the geologist points out the series of changes 
in the horse tribe from the five- to the one-toed. varieties, 
the writer holds that it is all for the best: God has pro- 
vided the horse with its hard hoof for man, who to 
make it harder adds a shoe. ‘‘ I hold that there are as 
clear proofs of design in the hoof as in the shoe upon 
it.’’? Against this complacent supernaturalism the new 
doctrines make but little headway. McCosh mentions 
among the causes of variation the one to which Darwin 
has given such prominence. It is natural selection, 
which to McCosh seems a not very happy phrase, as it 
is apt to leave the impression that there is a choice on 
the part of nature, whereas it is all produced by the 
arrangements made by the Creator. This is the doctrine 
of final cause, a doctrine of natural religion. Neverthe-  
-P-A-G-E-212
  204 EVOLUTIONISM 
less it is not opposed to the absolute mutability of 
species, which in its turn has become almost a religious 
doctrine, around which has gathered a sacred feeling 
which it is thought dangerous to disturb. With this 
opinion McCosh has little patience. It is a question for 
science to settle and not religion. 
To science, then, the author turns to trace the geo- 
logical history of the earth. His data he draws chiefly 
from Dana of Yale and Guyot of Princeton—both 
“‘reconcilers ’’? of Genesis and geology. From these 
data he argues that that which the scientists call a sys- 
tem is what Platonists call an idea, and theologians de- 
sign or purpose in the history of organic life. Of course 
in all this there is the universal law, established by a 
wide and uncontradicted experience that nature is uni- 
form. This much against the anti-evolutionists. But 
' at this point also extreme evolutionists are to be met, by 
showing that there are other powers which have modi- 
fied evolution such as light, life, sensation, instinct, in- 
telligence, morality ! 
The Princetonian has missed the chief point made by 
naturalism. When he claims that none of these agents 
are producible by the power of nature, he shows him- 
self incapable of grasping the doctrine of immanence, the 
belief in a universal principle inclusive of these mani- 
fold agencies and all to be put under the name of nature. 
The old-fashioned dualism of this thinker is again ex- 
posed. As evolution by physical causes cannot produce 
life with all its variations, he infers that God does it by an 
immediate fiat, even as he created matter and the forces 
that act in matter. All that can be allowed in restating 
the problem is that Darwinism has modified design only 
to this extent: by making these high agencies an act of 
Providence instead of an act of creation. It is not neces-  
-P-A-G-E-213
THE RECEPTION OF DARWINISM 205 
sary to go much further in exposition of the views of Mc- 
Cosh. They are more fully set forth in another book— 
Development: What It Can Do, and What It Cannot Do. 
But a word more is needed on the attitude of the man 
toward the whole movement. He has been held to have 
welcomed Darwinism, and to have set evolutionism on its 
legs in a conservative community. The truth of the mat- 
ter is quite the contrary. Evolution might be discussed 
in the college, but in the eighteenth, not the nineteenth 
century meaning of the term. Defined originally as the 
drawing of one thing out of another the conclusions 
drawn from it were didactic. The college head hence- 
forth shall do the thinking for his pupils. Darwinism 
never teaches that nature is red in tooth and claw, but 
that the survival of the fittest is a beneficial law. Just as 
the common soldier did not discover all the wisdom of 
Napoleon, so this, McCosh concludes, should be our posi- 
tion in regard to God’s works: we discover enough of the 
are to calculate the rest ; and as we see so much wisdom in 
the little that we know, we argue that there is vastly 
more in the much that is beyond. 
The compromising deist of the previous century speaks 
in the Scottish-American divine. He fully admits that 
there are results following from the laws of God which 
it is not easy to reconcile with the omniscience and 
benevolence of the deity, yet since ‘‘ by a higher arrange- 
ment of nature, or rather, the God of nature, the organic 
world is progressing. . . . There are cereals when before 
there were only heaths and mosses, and man himself is 
further removed from the savage state. . . . We have 
thus a promise that the earth may become a perfect abode 
for a perfected humanity.’’ 
McCosh has been considered by some Princetonians an 
advocate of Darwinism. But as Alexander Ormond has
-P-A-G-E-214
EE re Re RET Pe perenne Oe Bere eee Fel ets ee eee ee 
206 EVOLUTIONISM 
pointed out, he never became an evolutionist in his 
fundamental thought, and was never able to enter into 
the new theory because his age was a period of transition. 
The same may be said of McCosh’s learned pupil, 
Charles Woodruff Shields. The latter asserts, in his 
Philosophia Ultima, that his master from the first had led 
the creationists into alignment with the evolutionists and 
adds that from present signs it would seem that the tide 
of controversy has turned in favor of evolution, in some 
form and degree as logically consistent with the strictest 
creationalism. Shields makes this assertion, despite the 
fact that there are two rival schools which have arisen in 
the attempt to solve the great metaphysical problem, the 
development of absolute being. According to the former, 
he explains, the whole universe, both spiritual and ma- 
terial, has proceeded from deity, by successive acts of 
creation. According to the opposite school of thinkers, 
the totality of existence proceeds from some creative sub- 
stance or principle, under physical laws of evolution, em- 
bracing all mental as well as material phenomena. This 
is a fair generalization. So is the next to the effect that 
while German thinkers attempt chiefly the problem of 
harmonizing the physical with the logical development 
of the universe as projected by science and philosophy, 
English and American writers deal largely with the more 
practical task of reconciling evolution with morality, re- 
ligion, and orthodoxy. 
The latter point of view is peculiarly that of Shields. 
The great aim of his Final Philosophy is to give a survey 
of the sciences wherein rational and revealed are ulti- 
mately brought into reconciliation. The method of recon- 
ciliation in the case of evolution is somewhat strained. 
It consists in giving high praise to the supernaturalists 
and faint praise to the naturalists. For example, in the   
 
-P-A-G-E-215
THE RECEPTION OF DARWINISM 207 
ease of the anthropological science concerning the doc- 
trine of human evolution, ‘‘ distinguished ’’ biologists 
have maintained that the foetal development of man, so 
far from proving his animal pedigree, merely reflects 
that unity of plan which has pervaded the organic world 
from the beginning. Likewise, ‘‘ leading ’’ ethnologists 
hold that there is a profound gulf without connection or 
passage, separating the human species from every other. 
On the other hand, the ‘‘ so-called ’’ archxo-geologists 
have also been met upon their own ground, Dawson, for 
instance, maintaining that the famous Neanderthal skull 
is simply exceptional. . . . In short, if the ‘‘ notion ”’ 
of transmutation be separated from that of progression, 
we can readily imagine the scale of civilized and savage 
humanity descending as well as ascending from the 
image of a God and the image of an ape. 
The animus of Shields’ voluminous work is finally laid 
bare by such statements as these,—that Joseph Vandyke 
has argued elaborately that both theism and revelation 
are required to explain the origin of man; and that al- 
though the Presbyterian Professor Woodrow, of South 
Carolina, has been deprived of his theological chair for 
teaching a partial evolution, yet President Patton has 
stated the theory as still a hopeful problem in apologetics. 
Shields made a valiant attempt to be a balance-wheel 
between two opposite forces, but the dead weight of 
dogma pulled him back. Thus while he can assert that 
George Ticknor Curtis has ‘‘ judicially ’’ tested the theory 
of evolution and found it not proven, Charles Darwin 
remains for him a mere “‘ speculative ’’ naturalist. In 
fine, Shields, like his master McCosh, was in an age of 
transition and unable to grasp the significance of the 
new movement. 
‘We now turn from the apologist of Princeton to an-  
-P-A-G-E-216
  208 EVOLUTIONISM 
other thinker in a neighboring university, who, although 
a transitionalist, was also a transmutationist. Edward 
Cope of Philadelphia has the distinction of having 
founded an ‘‘ American school of biology ’’ which at- 
tempted to go beyond Darwin’s natural selection. Cope’s 
evolutionary philosophy was expressed in his chief work, 
The Origin of the Fittest. This work was notable coming 
at the time it did. In Philadelphia the tradition of free- 
thought had run into a narrow channel, but it was still 
partially preserved in the University and in those scien- 
tifie societies fathered by Franklin. But the public in 
general had lost that tradition of liberalism, and the 
town which had once been so hospitable to all comers had 
now closed its doors to foreign thought. Therefore, Cope 
expostulates, let those excellent people in whose minds 
there is considerable repugnance to the acceptance, or 
even consideration of the hypothesis of development, 
restrain their condemnation. They may object that the 
human species is certainly involved and man’s ascent 
from the ape asserted; and also that the scheme in gen- 
eral seems to conflict with that presented by the Mosaic 
account of creation; but it now behooves those interested 
to explain the events and to look any consequent neces- 
sary modification of their metaphysical or theological 
views squarely in the face. 
Of the two main consequences above portrayed, the 
first seemed the more distasteful. If the hypothesis here 
maintained be true, explains the naturalist, man is the 
descendant of some preéxistent generic type, the which, 
if it were now living, we would probably call an ape. It 
would be an objection of little weight could it be truly 
urged that there have as yet been discovered no remains 
of ape-like men, for we have frequently been called upon 
in the course of paleontological discovery to bridge 
 
-P-A-G-E-217
THE RECEPTION OF DARWINISM 209 
greater gaps than this, and greater remain, which we ex- 
pect to fill. But we have ape-like characters exhibited by 
more than one race of men yet existing. We all admit 
the existence of higher and lower races, the latter being 
those which we now find to present greater or less ap- 
proximations to the apes. The peculiar structural char- 
acters that belong to the negro in his most typical form 
are of that kind, however great may be the distance of 
his remove therefrom. The flattening of the nose and 
prolongation of the jaws constitute such a resemblance; 
so do the deficiency of the calf of the leg, and the ob- 
liquity of the pelvis, which approaches more the horizon- 
tal position than it does in the Caucasian. The investi- 
gations made at Washington during the war, with refer- 
ence to the physical characteristics of the soldiers, show 
that the arms of the negro are from one to two inches 
longer than those of the whites: another approximation 
to the ape. In fact, this race is a species of the genus 
Homo as distinct in character from the Caucasian as 
those we are accustomed to recognize in other depart- 
ments of the animal kingdom; but he is not distinct by 
isolation, since intermediate forms between him and the 
other species can be abundantly found. 
The second objection as to the conflict between the 
Mosaic account of creation and the Darwinian is to be 
met in the same way. ‘‘ Believe in the expert ’’ and the 
old view goes by the board. The modern theory of 
evolution has met with remarkably rapid acceptance by 
those best qualified to judge of its merits, namely, the 
zodlogists and botanists, while probably the majority of 
the public, in this region at least, profess to reject it. 
This inconsistency is due to two causes. In the first 
place, Darwin’s demonstration contained in the Origin 
of Species proves little more than that the species
-P-A-G-E-218
  210 EVOLUTIONISM 
of the same genus have had common origin, and 
also his theory of natural selection is incomplete as an 
explanation of their origin. In the second place, the 
unscientific world is unreasonable, little knowing the 
slow steps and laborious effort by which any general 
truth is reached. Hence they find in incompleteness 
ground of condemnation of the whole. Now Science is 
glad if she can prove that the earth stands on an ele- 
phant, and gladder if she can demonstrate that the ele- 
phant stands on a turtle; but if she cannot show the 
support of the turtle she is not discouraged, but labors 
patiently, trusting that the future of discovery will 
justify the experience of the past. 
Cope’s appeal to the higher court of the expert is not 
an appeal to authority, nor a mere substitute of present 
for past dogma. If some of the people find Darwin’s 
argument incomplete, or in some points weak, it may be 
answered so do the student classes, who, nevertheless, be- 
lieve it. This is largely because Darwin’s facts and 
thoughts repeat a vast multiplicity of experiences of 
every student, which are of as much significance as those 
cited by him, and which only required a courageous 
officer to marshal them into line, a mighty host, conquer- ' 
ing and to conquer. These will slowly find their way 
into print, some in one country and some in another. 
In distinguishing between the fact of evolution and the 
various views of evolution, Cope effectively meets the ob- 
jections of the old school against the new theory. The 
evidence in favor of evolution, he explains, is abundant; 
much less has been done in explanation of the law of 
evolution. Darwin and his immediate followers have 
brought out the law of natural selection; Spencer has 
endeavored to express them in terms of force; while, 
among Americans, Hyatt, Packard, and Cope himself
-P-A-G-E-219
COSMIC PHILOSOPHY: JOHN FISKE 211 
advanced the law of acceleration and retardation. It is 
this latter group, headed by Cope, that has been called 
the American biological school. Out of this school we 
shall take up later one notable living representative, 
James Mark Baldwin. Meanwhile we must turn from the 
philosophy of the chair to that of the rostrum, and con- 
sider a popular representative of the movement. 
4. Cosmic PuiosopHy: JoHN FisKE 
As a summarizer of the controversy between special 
ereation and derivation John Fiske has given us the 
clearest contemporary account. This account, as Josiah 
Royce has pointed out, is somewhat rancorous, because 
at that time Agassiz still dominated the current teach- 
ing, and the Darwinian theory was still on trial before 
the public. That public was given its choice. Was it to 
be special creation or derivation? The pedigree of the 
two theories has something to do with the decision. The 
former hypothesis, says Fiske, originated in the crude 
mythological conceptions of the ancient Hebrews and was 
uncritically accepted until the time of Lamarck and 
Goethe. The latter hypothesis originated in the method- 
ical studies of the phenomenon of organic life, and has 
been held by a large number of biologists during the first 
half of the nineteenth century. Now, while the Hebrew 
writer presents us with a conerete picture of the crea- 
tion of man, a homogeneous clay model of the human form 
at once transmuted into a heterogeneous combination of 
organs and tissues—the few naturalists who still make a 
show of upholding the special creation hypothesis care- 
fully refrain from specification. When challenged they 
take refuge in grandiloquent phrases about ‘‘ Creative 
Will ’’ and ‘‘ free action of an Intelligent Power,’’—
-P-A-G-E-220
  212 EVOLUTIONISM 
very much as the cuttlefish extricates itself from a dis- 
agreeable predicament by hiding in a shower of its own 
ink. When translated, however, from the dialect of 
mythology into the dialect of science, the special crea- 
tion hypothesis falls flat. It asserts that untold millions 
of molecules rushed together at some appointed instant 
from divers quarters and grouped themselves into an 
adult mammal. . . . Such an hypothesis, which involves 
such an assumption, is at once excluded from the pale of 
science. 
The opposite hypothesis, that of derivation, has four 
kinds of arguments in its favor. The first of these is 
classification. This is not the scheme of Agassiz, who at- 
tempted to explain the four distinct types of animal 
structure by resuscitating from its moss-covered tomb the 
Platonic theory of ideas. Hardly! The scientific scheme 
of classification is a complex arrangement of organisms 
in groups within groups, resembling each other at the 
bottom of the scale and differing most widely at the 
top. Now, if each species has been separately created, no 
reason can be assigned for such an arrangement,—unless 
perchance someone can be found hardy enough to main- 
tain that it was intended as a snare and a delusion for 
human intelligence. The old opponents of geology, who 
strove to maintain at whatever cost the scientific credit of 
the Mosaic myth of the creation, asserted that fossil 
plants and animals were created already dead and pet- 
rified, just for the fun of the thing. Manifestly those 
persons take a quite similar position who pretend that 
God created separately the horse, ass, zebra, and quagga, 
having previously created a beast enough like all of 
them to be their common grandfather. Now, the true 
theory of classification depends not upon special creation, 
but common origin, a given family being capable of ar- 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
COSMIC PHILOSOPHY: JOHN FISKE 213 
rangement in diverging groups and sub-groups, along 
lines which ramify like branches, branchlets, and. twigs 
of a tree. 
An equally powerful argument is furnished by the 
embryonic development of organisms. Why does a mam- 
mal begin to develop as if it were going to become a 
fish, and then, changing its course, act as if it were going 
to become a reptile or bird, and only after much delay 
assume the peculiar characteristics of mammals? On 
the evolutionary theory, these phenomena are explicable 
as due to the integration or summing-up of adaptive 
processes by which modifications, slowly acquired through 
generations of ancestral organisms, are more and more 
rapidly repeated in the embryo. On the hypothesis that 
each species of organisms was independently built up by 
a divine architect, how are we to explain these circuitous 
proceedings? Unless it were due to recapitulation, the 
process would be as futile as the work of an architect who 
could not erect a palace, except by first using his ma- 
terials in the shape of a hut, and then rebuilding the hut 
as a cottage, and finally as a palace. Again there are 
the equally significant facts of morphology. Why, unless 
through common inheritance, should all vertebrates be 
constructed on the same type? It is a familiar fact that 
the arms of men and apes, the forelegs of quadrupeds, 
the wings of birds, and the breast fins of fishes are 
structurally identical, being developed from the same 
embryonal rudiments. Why is this so? But two an- 
swers are possible. We may either say, with the Mussul- 
man, ‘‘ it so pleased Allah, whose name be exalted ’’; 
or we may honestly acknowledge the scientific implica- 
tion that such community of structure is strong evidence 
in favor of community of origin. Finally, the facts of 
geographical distribution and geological succession are in 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  214 EVOLUTIONISM 
complete harmony with the development theory. On the 
hypothesis of special creations, no good reason can be 
given why the extinct animals found in any geographical 
area should resemble, both in general structure and in 
special modifications, the animals which now live in the 
same area. It has indeed been urged, by upholders of 
the special creation hypothesis, that these striking re- 
semblances may be explained by supposing each species 
to have been created in strict adaptation to the condi- 
tions of life surrounding it. But there is no appreciable 
difference, for example, between the conditions of 
existence in the seas east and west of the Isthmus of 
Panama; yet, according to the assumption of the special- 
creationists, their marine faunas ought to be almost 
exactly alike, which they are not. The presumption 
raised at the outset against the doctrine of special crea- 
tion is even superfiuously confirmed by the testimony of 
facts. Not only is this doctrine discredited by its bar- 
barie origin, and by the absurd or impossible assump- 
tions which it would require us to make, but it utterly 
fails to explain a single one of the phenomena of the 
classification, embryology, morphology, and distribution 
of extinct and living organisms. While, on the other 
hand, the doctrine of derivation is not only accredited by 
its scientific origin, and by its appealing to none but veri- 
fiable processes and agencies, but it affords an explana- 
tion for each and all of the above-mentioned phe- 
nomena. 
Such is the contrast drawn up by Fiske between what 
he comes to call anthropomorphism and cosmism. The 
latter term is a favorite with its author. He applies it to 
his voluminous work from which this discussion of Dar- 
winism is taken. That work, on Cosmic Philosophy, is 
in large measure an interpretation to the American pub-
-P-A-G-E-223
  COSMIC PHILOSOPHY: JOHN FISKE 215 
lie of the system of Herbert Spencer, which, it is hardly 
needful to say, clashed with the old conservative view. 
To those who sought design and purpose in the universe 
the Spencerian Unknowable was like the House of 
Lords,—‘‘ it did nothing in particular and did it very 
well.’’ Now, this Spencerian vagueness failed to satisfy 
even the ardent disciple, Fiske. He therefore proceeded 
to modify that system. He is opposed to any anthropo- 
morphic theism, because personality and infinity are 
terms expressive of ideas which are mutually incom- 
patible. Nevertheless, the phenomenal universe is the 
manifestation of some definite power. Here the older 
forms of design are unconvincing. The Infinite does not 
contrive, because the doctrine of evolution shows us that 
the universe is not a contrivance, but an organism with 
an indwelling principle of life. It was not made, but 
has grown. In a word, the teleology of nature is an all- 
pervading harmony. 
Fiske as philosopher has at last been forced into the 
problem of the relation of Darwinism and design. A 
compromise which Asa Gray attempted, he seeks to effect. 
The conclusion is interesting, it is the old Stoic solu- 
tion, the solution which requires an immanent principle. 
To this view of Fiske’s, Joseph Cook, the Boston Monday 
lecturer, attached a name, remarkable in its anticipation 
of a famous modern work. Cook cites several theories of 
the origin of species, beginning with Cope’s self-elevation 
by appetency, and ending with Dana’s adjustment of 
natural forces with breaks of special intervention. But 
of all the views he gives fullest definition to this: Imma- 
nent action and direction of divine power, working by the 
purposive collocation and adjustment of natural forces, 
acting without breaks,—or the theory of creative evolu- 
tion.
-P-A-G-E-224
  216 EVOLUTIONISM 
With this anticipation of the Bergsonian phrase, we 
pass on to a prominent living exponent of genetic evolu- 
tionism. 
5. GENETIC EvotuTIONISsM: JAMES Mark BALDWIN 
Out of a controversy with Cope has arisen one of the 
most fruitful enlargements of Darwinism. We refer to the 
theory of James Mark Baldwin called ‘‘ Organic Selec- 
tion ’’ as opening a sphere for the application of the 
principle of natural selection. Cope as a neo-Lamarck- 
ian had emphasized use-inheritance and growth-force. 
Baldwin as a neo-Darwinian claims that these are meta- 
physical assumptions for which there is only an arti- 
ficial need. As the Darwinian principle of natural selec- 
tion supplanted the special-creation theory, so will the 
new factor of organic selection supplant Cope’s theory 
of accommodation by consciousness. After years of study 
and experiment with children the writer is convinced 
that organic selection is a direct substitute for Lamarck- 
ian heredity. It avoids the occultism of physical trans- 
mission and puts in its place social heredity, the ac- 
quisition of functions from the social environment. Thus 
as soon as animals can use their native impulses in an 
imitative way they begin to learn directly, by what may 
be called ‘‘ cross cuts ’’ to a desirable goal, the tradi- 
tional habits of their species. The chick which imitates 
the hen in drinking does not have to wait for a happy ac- 
cident, nor to make a series of experiments, to find out 
that water is to be drunk. All the remarkable accom- 
modations of an imitative sort, so conspicuous in the 
higher animals, enable them to acquire the habits and 
behavior of their kind without running the risks of trial 
and error. Calling this store of habits of whatever kind 
‘*tradition,’’? and calling the individual’s absorption
-P-A-G-E-225
GENETIC EVOLUTIONISM 217 
of them and his consequent education in tradition his 
“* social heredity,’’ we have a more or less independent 
determining factor in evolution. 
Organic selection becomes, accordingly, a universal 
principle in so far as accommodation is universal. This 
meets the view of the Lamarckians that evolution does 
somehow reflect individual progress; but it meets it with- 
out adopting the principle of Lamarckian inheritance. 
Indeed it would seem that high intellectual and moral 
progress are matters of social accommodation rather than 
that of direct natural inheritance on the part of indi- 
viduals. Galton has shown how rare a thing it is for 
artistic, literary, or other marked talent to maintain its 
strength in later generations. Instead, we find such en- 
dowments showing themselves in many individuals at 
about the same time, in the same communities, and 
under common social conditions. Groups of artists, 
musicians, literary men, appeared together, constituting, 
as it were, a social outburst. 
Baldwin’s view of the predominance of the social fac- 
tor may throw some light even on the obscure subject 
of the origin of the genius. It is much more effective 
in the case of the normal child. In his first volume on 
Mental Development it is shown that the child’s life his- 
torically is a faithful reproduction of his social condi- 
tion. He is, from childhood up, excessively receptive 
to social suggestion; his entire learning is a process of 
conforming to social patterns. The essential to this, in 
his heredity, is very great plasticity, cerebral balance 
and equilibrium, a readiness to overflow into the new 
channels which his social environment dictates. He has 
to learn everything for himself, and in order to do this 
he must begin in a state of great plasticity and mobility. 
These social lessons which he learns for himself take the
-P-A-G-E-226
  218 EVOLUTIONISM 
place largely of the heredity of particular paternal ac- 
quisitions. The father must have been plastic to learn, 
and this plasticity is, so far as the evidence goes, the 
nervous condition of consciousness; thus the father 
learned, through his consciousness, from his social en- 
vironment. The child does the same. What he inherits 
is the nervous plasticity and the consciousness. He 
learns particular acts for himself; and what he learns is, 
in its main lines, what his father learned. So he is just 
as well off, the child of Darwinism, as if he were physi- 
eal heir to the acquisitions which his father made. 
By his emphasis on the social, Baldwin has raised the 
problem of evolution to a higher plane. Adaptation by 
intelligent selection makes the Lamarckian factor un- 
necessary. All the resources of ‘‘ social transmission ’’— 
the handing down of intelligent acquisitions by paternal 
instruction, imitation, gregarious life, come indirectly to 
take the place of the physical inheritance of such adap- 
tations. This is the proof positive. The proof negative 
lies in the fact that most of the psychologists are not 
appealed to by the extreme facility and ease of the 
Lamarckian solution. If experience is inherited, why 
have not racial psychological experiences of the most 
ancient and uniform order—such as those of space per- 
ception, time estimation, verbal speech, the rudiments of 
the three ‘‘ r’s,’’ drilled into every child and used with 
absolute uniformity throughout life—why have not such 
functions become congenital ? 
As with the human so with the animal race. The 
variations which are not adequate at first, or are only 
partially correlated, are supplemented by the accom- 
modations which the creature makes, and so the species 
has the time to perfect its inadequate congenital mechan- 
ism. Thus the swans of Lake Geneva show relatively dif- 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
  
GENETIC EVOLUTIONISM 219 
ferent length of neck. Those with longer necks can feed 
under water over a greater area of the bottom. Constant 
stretching of the neck not only develops each swan, but 
may be supposed to have encouraged variations in the 
direction of longer neck, that is, variations coincident in 
direction with their active accommodative processes. So 
the long neck has been evolved. 
Darwinism has been defended through organic selec- 
tion as a substitute for use-inheritance. For example, 
the more trivial experiences of the individual, such as 
body mutilations, which it is not desirable to perpetuate, 
would not be taken up in the evolution of the race. Or- 
ganic selection would set a premium only on the varia- 
tions which were important enough to be of some material 
use, just as the new science of eugenics is founded upon 
the possibility of carrying further in a systematic way 
the intentional improvement of the race. In regard to the 
exclusive production of reflexes, as would be the case 
under use-inheritance, organic selection is adverse. In- 
stead of the rigidity of inherited instincts we have the 
plasticity possible under the minimum of instinctive 
equipment. <A chick, for example, is bound down by a 
mass of inherited reflexes. The child, though at first help- 
less from its lack of instinctive tendencies, has an enor- 
mous advantage in being able to pick and choose by 
means of intelligence. It is intelligence which secures 
the widest possible range of personal adjustments, and 
by so doing widens the sphere of organic selection, so 
that the creature which thinks has a general screen 
from the action of natural selection. The struggle for 
existence, depending upon the physical qualities on 
which the animals rely, is in some degree done away 
with. 
Organic selection has now reached an interesting
-P-A-G-E-228
  220 EVOLUTIONISM 
speculative position. In protesting against rigid in- 
heritance it brings in accommodation. In emphasizing 
intelligence it brings in educability. The old dualism is 
breaking down. By rendering the physical plastic, the 
physical becomes permeable to intellect. Out of this 
emerges a new phase of freedom. Instead of the deter- 
minism either of the old preformism or that of mere 
mechanical natural selection we have a case where natu- 
ral selection operates to preserve creatures, because they 
adapt themselves to their environment. The directive 
factor is now largely self-directive, since the intelligence 
represents the highest and most specialized form of 
accommodation. In a word, organic selection has sup- 
plemented and enlarged the old natural selection by 
bringing in the doctrine of the survival of the accom- 
modating. Organic selection, then, has this summary 
advantage: It opens a great sphere for the application 
of the principle of natural selection upon organisms, 
that is, selection on the basis of what they do, rather 
than of what they are; of the new use they make 
of their functions, rather than of the mere possession of 
certain congenital characters. A premium is set on 
plasticity and adaptability of function rather than on 
congenital fixity of structure; and this adaptability 
reaches its highest level in the intelligence. 
With the entrance of consciousness as the vehicle of 
accommodation we are ready to consider the place of 
individual purpose in evolution. As supplemented by 
organic selection natural selection is now seen to be not 
unteleological. The charge made against Darwinism 
was that, with its emphasis on ‘‘ chance ’’ and on the 
*« fortuitous,’’ its workings were blind and capricious. 
This charge can be met, answers Baldwin: It has been 
found that biological phenomena—variations in particu-
-P-A-G-E-229
  GENETIC EVOLUTIONISM 221 
lar—follow the definite law of probability; in short, 
that there is no such thing in nature as the really fortu- 
itous or unpredictable. Natural selection, therefore, 
works upon variations which are themselves subject to 
law. If this be true, then natural selection may be the 
method of realizing a cosmic design, if such exists, the 
law of variation guaranteeing the presence of a fixed 
proportional number of individuals which are ‘“‘ fit ’’ 
with reference to a preéstablished end. . . . A good 
illustration may be seen in the use made of vital statis- 
tics in life insurance. We pay a premium rate based on 
the calculation of the probability of life, and thus by 
observing this law realize the teleological purpose of 
providing for our children; and we do it more effect- 
ively, though indirectly, than if we carried our money in 
bags around our necks, and gradually added our sav- 
ings to it. Furthermore, the insurance company is a 
great teleological agency, both for us and for itself; for 
it also secures dividends for its stockholders on the basis 
of charges adjusted to the ‘‘ chances ”’ of life, drawn 
from the mortality tables. Why is it not a reasonable 
view that cosmic Purpose—if we may call it so—works 
by similar, but more adequate, knowledge of the whole 
and so secures its results—whether in conformity to or 
in contravention of our individual striving? 
In raising these questions the author disavows any 
attempt to carry them out into a philosophical view of 
reality, a theoretical doctrine of metaphysics. Neverthe- 
less in a series of illuminating figures he does suggest 
a metaphysics of the most stimulating sort. Genetic 
science, he explains, in the presence of an exact and 
numerical science must make the reservation that it is a 
cross-section, not a longitudinal section to which the 
quantitative and analytical formulas apply. But keep-
-P-A-G-E-230
  222 EVOLUTIONISM 
ing in mind the old Greek antithesis between being and 
becoming, genetic science, as a science of development 
and evolution, must preserve the prospective attitude. 
This, then, is the chief postulate of the theory of genetic 
modes, that that series of events only is truly genetic 
which cannot be constructed before it has happened, and 
which cannot be exhausted by reading backward after 
it has happened. As between the purely mechanical or 
mathematical sciences and that of the next ascending set 
of phenomena, biology, recent discussion is full of il- 
luminating matter which might be cited in support of 
these principles. That the synthesis which is called life 
is different in some respects from that of chemistry is 
not only the contention of the vitalists, but also the ad- 
mission of the adherents of a physico-chemical theory 
of life. In reply to those who think not only that living 
matter is a chemical compound, but also that there is 
nothing to add to this chemical formula—when once it 
is discovered—in order to attain a final explanation of 
life, we have only to put to them the further problem 
of genesis, as over and above that of analysis—that is, 
to ask not only for the analytic formula, the chemical 
formula, for protoplasm, but also for the laws of repro- 
duction and growth, which always characterize life. The 
cross-section formula must be supplemented by the 
longitudinal-section formula. Here we discover the fact 
that the development is by a series of syntheses, each 
chemical, but each, so far as we know, producing some- 
thing new—a new genetic mode. If this be denied, 
then we have to ask the chemist to reproduce the series; 
and if he claim that this might be done if he knew how, 
we ask him to reproduce the series backwards. What 
the biologists need to do is to recognize the limitations 
of one method, and the justification of the other in its
-P-A-G-E-231
  GENETIC EVOLUTIONISM 223 
own province. In the life processes there seems to be a 
real genetic series, an irreversible series. Each stage 
exhibits a new form of organization. After it has hap- 
pened, it is quite competent to show, by the formulas of 
chemistry and physics, that the organization is pos- 
sible and legitimate. Yet it is only by actual observa- 
tion and description of the facts in the development of 
the organism, that the progress of the life principle can 
be made out. The former is quantitative and analytic 
science; the latter is genetic science. 
We leave Baldwin’s Development and Evolution 
at that informing doctrine of irreversibility which has 
been expressly utilized by the author of Creative Evo- 
lution. This utilization is significant, yet the Ameri- 
ean’s work is valuable not only as furnishing a link be- 
tween the English and French conceptions of evolu- 
tion, but also as a refutation of the charge of the deca- 
dence of Darwinism. That refutation is carried on more 
fully in the subsequent book entitled Darwin and the 
Humanities. Originating as a contribution to the Dar- 
winian celebration of the American Philosophical As- 
sociation in 1909, this work traces the influence of Dar- 
win in the science of mind, the humanities broadly 
defined. As the result of his labors for twenty-five 
years the author comes to the conclusion that natural 
selection is in principle the universal law of genetic 
organization and progress in nature. <As applied to the 
first of the sciences of the mind, psychology, the Dar- 
winian factors are found most effective. If, that is, a 
selection of processes and habits goes on within the 
organism—a functional selection resulting in a real 
molding of the individual—there may be at every stage 
of growth a combination of genetic characters with ac- 
quired modifications. Then, natural selection would
-P-A-G-E-232
  224. EVOLUTIONISM 
fall in each case upon this joint or correlated result. 
The organisms showing the most effective combinations 
would survive. Put in psychological terms this means: 
Give the animal a little sense—a grain of the capacity 
to profit by experience, to imitate, to codperate, to de- 
ceive, to remember and distinguish what is good for it 
from what is bad—a bit of intelligence, broadly under- 
stood, and he is started on the career of learning in 
comparison with which his earlier achievements become 
quite insignificant. If, in short, we are to allow that 
accommodative or learning processes of whatever kind do 
have any influence, however indirect, on the course of 
evolution, then that prime, that superb weapon of learn- 
ing, mind, comes to its own and starts upon its splendid 
career. But if this be so, if mind be natural and also 
useful, then we are still of course within the Darwin- 
ian circle of ideas. Why are not mental faculties and 
functions to be considered characters which have been 
evolved by selection for their utility? Darwin held 
this in his Descent of Man. But instead of the desul- 
tory recognition of the place and effectiveness of mental 
states in a theory dealing mainly with the physical, we 
now see the universal principle of the relation of mental 
to organic evolution. Mind is correlated with plasticity, 
its evolution with that of brain and nerves. The his- 
tory of the evolution of these organs is also that of the 
evolution of mind. In this we have the next great step 
in which biology and, psychology join hands in a safe 
and accomplished generalization: that of the correla- 
tion of nervous plasticity with mind, of ‘‘ educability ’’ 
with ‘‘ sense.’’ 
The force of this, for our present purpose, is this: 
plasticity is a real character, a character the opposite 
of fixity. It is opposed even to the potential sort of
-P-A-G-E-233
  
GENETIC EVOLUTIONISM 225 
fixity assumed by preformism—the theory that all sub- 
sequent adjustments are already present potentially in 
the germ. It leaves to the organism genuine alterna- 
tives ; genuine novelties of adjustment are possible. And 
consciousness, intelligence, is also a real character, cor- 
related with plasticity. Both are present together, how- 
ever we may account for it; and both have been advanced 
for their utility, as Darwin’s hypothesis requires. This 
is especially seen in the ‘‘ new ”’ logic, where the theory 
of truth becomes either one of extreme ‘‘ Pragmatism ”’ 
or one merely of ‘‘ Instrumentalism.’’? Instrumentalism 
holds that all truth is tentatively arrived at and experi- 
mentally verified. The method of knowledge is the now 
familiar Darwinian procedure of ‘‘ trial and error.’’ 
The thinker, whether working in the laboratory with 
things or among the products of his own imaginative 
thought, tries out hypotheses; and only by trying out 
hypotheses does he establish truth. The knowledge al- 
ready possessed is used ‘‘ instrumentally ’’ in the form 
of a hypothesis or conjecture, for the discovery of fur- 
ther facts or truths. This reinstates in the sphere of 
thinking the method of Darwinian selection. 
It is in his application to philosophy that Baldwin 
brings out some of the most telling results of Darwinism. 
He illustrates this in that summary chapter which be- 
gins with psychology and ends with religion. Psychol- 
ogy, he tells us, has always been the vestibule, as it were, 
to philosophy, and advance in the latter never gets far 
beyond that of the former. So when psychology adopted 
seriously a naturalistic and positivistie method—the 
method, that is, of the positive sciences of nature— 
philosophy had also to recognize the generality of these 
points of view. Philosophical truth, like all other truth, 
must be looked upon as truth about nature—the nature
-P-A-G-E-234
    226 EVOLUTIONISM 
of the world and the nature of man—and its progress is 
secured through reflection exercised under the control 
of the positive instruments and methods employed in 
those subjects. Purely deductive, speculative and per- 
sonal systems of philosophy may be useful as gymnastics 
and profitable as sources of individual fame; but the 
genuine progress of philosophy is to be looked for only 
through those methods of confirmation and proof which 
control the imagination and permanently satisfy the 
logical and other demands of common reflection. There 
may be different philosophies, but, like rival scientific 
hypotheses, each must show the array of facts, aims, 
motives, values, that it can explain better than any 
other. Philosophy is not an exercise of preference, but 
an exercise of reason! 
In these directions, continues the author, Darwin has 
strongly influenced modern philosophical thought; so 
strongly that the historical issues of philosophy have 
taken on new forms, which, in the new names now in 
vogue to describe them, are unfamiliar to the old-school 
philosophers. Instead of the problem of ‘‘ design,’’ we 
now have the discussions of ‘‘ teleology ’’; instead of 
the doctrine of ‘‘ chance,’’ we now have the ‘‘ theory 
of probabilities ’’; instead of ‘‘ fatalism ’’ and ‘‘ free- 
dom,’’ we now have ‘‘ determininism ’’ and ‘‘ indeter- 
minism,’’ variously qualified; instead of ‘‘ God,’’ we 
hear of ‘‘ absolute experience ’’; instead of ‘‘ Provi- 
dence,’’ of ‘‘ order ’’ and ‘‘ law ’’ ; instead of ‘‘ mind 
and body,”’ of ‘‘ dualism or monism.’’ Not that all this 
shifting of emphasis and change of terms are due to 
Darwin; but that they are incidents of the newer antith- 
eses current since the mind has been considered as sub- 
ject to ‘‘ natural law,’’ and the world, including God 
and man, as common material for science to investi-
-P-A-G-E-235
  GENETIC EVOLUTIONISM 227 
gate. Scientific naturalism and positivism are methods 
of unlimited scope; and the question of philosophy is, 
what does the whole system of things, of external facts 
and of human values alike—when thus investigated— 
really turn out to mean? So design may be illustrated 
by considering more fully a central problem—one com- 
mon to biology and psychology alike, and one whose 
answer colors the whole of one’s philosophy. It is the 
old problem of ‘‘ design,’’ giving rise in biology to 
theories of ‘‘ special creation ’’ and ‘‘ chance,’’ and now 
discussed, alike in biology and psychology, in the form 
of questions of ‘‘ vitalism ’’ and ‘‘ teleology.’? In what 
sense, if any, is the world—and in it, life and mind— 
an ordered, progressive, and intelligible whole? And 
if it is such in any sense, how did it become so? Is it 
due to intelligence ?—and if so, whose intelligence? The 
most violent controversies aroused by the publication 
of the Origin of Species were let loose about this ques- 
tion. To Darwin’s opponents ‘‘ chance,’’ ‘‘ fortuitous 
or spontaneous variation,’’ was to take the place of 
intelligent creation, Providence, God. If there be no 
rule of selection and survival save that of utility, and no 
source of the useful save the overproduction of chance 
cases, where is the Guiding Hand? Does not Natural 
Selection dispense with a ruling Intelligence altogether? 
‘We have only to understand the present-day statement 
of this problem, explains Baldwin, to see the enormous 
concession to naturalism which the theory of Darwin has 
forced. Instead of ‘‘ chance ’’ in the sense of uncaused 
accident, we now have the notion of ‘‘ probability,’’ a 
mathematically exact interpretation of what is only to 
superficial observation fortuitous and capricious; instead 
of an interfering Providence, we have universal order 
born of natural law. And it is within such conceptions
-P-A-G-E-236
  228 EVOLUTIONISM 
as these, now taken as common ground of argument, that 
the discussion of teleology is conducted. The world is 
no longer thought of as a piece of mosaic work put to- 
gether by a skillful artificer—as the old design theory 
looked upon it—but as a whole, a cosmos, of law-abiding 
and progressive change. A philosopher who knows his 
ealling to-day seeks to interpret natural law, not to dis- 
cover violations of it. The violations, if they came, 
would reduce the world to caprice, chance, and chaos, 
instead of providing a relief from these things. 
So Darwin’s view, argues the author, while adminis- 
tering a coup de grace to theories of chance and special 
creation, both equally desultory, capricious, and lawless, 
replaced them once for all with law. It indicated the 
method of operation by which the progressive forms of 
nature are evolved in stages more and more ordered and 
fit. The operation of such a law is no less and no more 
‘* rational,’’ no less and no more ‘‘ fatalistic,’’ no less 
and no more “ atheistic,’’ than is that of any other 
law, physical or mental. What law—meaning simply 
what regular method of change—is operative in nature? 
and what is its range, as compared with other such laws? 
—these are questions entirely of fact, to be determined 
by scientific investigation. And how far the method 
or law called by Darwin ‘‘ natural selection ’’ goes, what 
its range really is, we are now beginning to see in its 
varied applications in the sciences of life and mind. It 
seems to be—unless future investigations set positive 
limits to its application—a universal principle; for the 
intelligence itself, in its procedure of tentative experi- 
mentation, or ‘‘ trial and error,’’ appears to operate 
in accordance with it.

CHAPTER VIII 
MODERN IDEALISM 
1. Tae German INFLUENCES 
Ir is hard to measure the intangible and to weigh the 
immaterial, yet it may safely be said that the German 
influences on American thought have been the most 
significant and the most weighty of all the foreign 
forces. In the words of one of our German-American 
lecturers this state of affairs is due, in large measure, 
to the after-effect of that great epoch of German human- 
ism signalized by the names of Goethe and Kant, Schiller 
and Fichte. The very substance of the life-work of 
these men and their compeers consisted in this, that they 
replaced the ecclesiastical doctrine of atonement by the 
belief in the saving quality of restless striving. Never 
in the whole history of the world has there been held up 
to man an ideal of life more exalted, more inspiring, 
freer from unworthy or belittling motives than their 
teachings. They trusted in the essential goodness of all 
life; they conceived of the universe as a great spiritual 
being, engaged in constant self-revelation and in a con- 
stant struggle toward higher forms of existence. They 
believed that man, as a part of this spiritual universe, 
was in immediate and instinctive communication with 
its innermost essence; and they saw the great office of 
man in helping the spirit toward its fullest self-realiza- 
tion. 
The German humanism, as thus described by Kuno 
229
-P-A-G-E-238
  230 MODERN IDEALISM 
Francke, has indeed had great influence upon our ways 
of thinking. The proof of that lies in the very famil- 
iarity of its doctrines. But that influence and that 
familiarity were not matters of an instant. It took 
many years and many men to accomplish the result. 
There were in the way great difficulties, due to race, so- 
cial conditions, and language. The first flight of Teu- 
tonic immigrants began with the wretched refugees of 
the Thirty Years’ War, and ended about the time of 
the adoption of our Constitution. Previous to 1789 it 
was predominantly the peasant classes that came into 
the country. But among such farmers as were repre- 
sented by the Pennsylvania ‘‘ Dutch ’’ one could not 
hope to find regular philosophers. There were indeed 
mystics like Conrad Beissel and his Ephrata community, 
but their theosophy had slight influence and remained 
as little appreciated as did the architecture of the 
brotherhood buildings and the music of its inmates. 
Except for a slight infiltration of Protestant sectaries 
like the Lutherans, with one or two scholars of local 
note, the next flight of immigrants was delayed for over 
half a century. But with the refugees of 48 there came 
in both blood and brains. Men like Hecker and Koerner, 
Schurz and Sigel, fleeing from the reactionary militar~ 
ism of the Fatherland, sought to found a new Germany 
in the new West. This group, and others of Germanic 
origin, made possible the St. Louis school and furnished 
the nucleus of those audiences which listened to the 
diluted transcendentalism of Emerson and Alcott. 
That transcendentalism was indeed diluted, for it was 
a very much modified German philosophy which first 
excited attention in the country. James Murdock 
of Yale College, the neglected historian of the move- 
ment, explains how Coleridge, being a poet more than a

philosopher, obscured, if he did not pervert understand- 
ing of the genuine tenets of Kant. The Aids to Reflec- 
tion were indeed republished in New England as early 
ag 1829, but they were an aid to the rhapsodists rather 
than to the cautious thinkers. Now, most Americans at 
this time were of the latter conservative type. While they 
belonged to the empirical school and were ‘‘ slow, cau- 
tious, dubitating, and modest,’’ the Germans belonged 
to the metaphysical and were ‘‘ daring, bold, and self- 
confident.’’ Besides these temperamental differences 
there were other difficulties. Such was the novelty of 
the principles of Kant and so strange was the termin- 
ology that another writer speaks of the absurdity of 
offering for the edification of sober, matter-of-fact Anglo- 
Saxons the unintelligible idealism of Kant, Fichte, and 
Schelling. 
To the hostile mental attitude there were added ma- 
terial difficulties. George Ticknor, wishing to prepare 
himself for his trip to Goettingen, had to send to New 
Hampshire for a German dictionary, while a German 
grammar was hard to find in all New England. But 
perhaps the greatest obstruction to the free importation 
of foreign ideas was the servile deference to English 
judgment and the consequent embargo upon the intel- 
lectual goods of other nations. Intellectually New Eng- 
land was as yet a colony of Old England, and the per- 
nicious interdiction of metaphysical trade with other 
countries still obtained. This can be illustrated by the 
early native accounts of the Kantian philosophy. Dis- 
regarding some hack-writer’s version in the first Ameri- 
can reprint of that Noah’s Ark of all knowledge—the 
Encyclopedia Britannica—we turn to the notice given 
by Samuel Miller in his Retrospect of the Eighteenth 
Century. This is not so much a notice as a slander, and
-P-A-G-E-240
  232 MODERN IDEALISM 
yet the author is hardly liable, since he obtained his 
information at third hand. Miller quotes from a London 
reviewer of an English translation of a German criticism 
of the critical philosophy. With no direct knowledge 
of the original he repeats the stale strictures upon the 
great thinker of Koenigsberg: Kant is guilty of indefi- 
nite evasions because his system is neither deism nor 
materialism, libertinism nor fatalism; he has studied to 
envelop his system in an enigmatic language because that 
system tends to undermine all religion and morals ;— 
in short, the famous Prussian’s theoretical jargon, in- 
stead of being calculated to advance science, or to for- 
ward human improvements, has rather a tendency to 
delude, to bewilder, and to shed a baneful influence on 
the true interests of man. 
This so-called first notice of the Kantian philosophy 
in America has been styled by the Germans a piece of 
comical naiveté. Nevertheless that naiveté can be under- 
stood. Miller in his Retrospect was merely a watch-dog 
of orthodoxy. When other dogs barked he joined in 
the ery of alarm. To him, as a follower of the Scotch 
philosophy, realism was the most rational, idealism the 
most absurd of schemes. A more sympathetic attitude 
towards the Continental system is found in Philadelphia 
and among certain Pennsylvanians of German origin. 
In the Philadelphia Monthly Magazine of 1798 we find 
‘the earliest discovered notice of Kant on this side of 
the water. Taken largely from Lange it has some sensible 
and sympathetic remarks on the new philosophy. As 
this philosophy has considerably excited the curiosity 
of the learned in Europe, the compiler hopes that his 
sketch will prove acceptable to his readers. The gist of 
this sketch is as follows: It forms the chief business of 
the Criterion of Pure Reason, by measuring and ascer-
-P-A-G-E-241
  
THE GERMAN INFLUENCES 233 
taining the limits of our different faculties, to exhibit 
a complete and distinct system of all our means of ac- 
quiring knowledge. Now, since it is only by apprehen- 
sion in this our pure form, that anything becomes an 
object of science, knowledge thus acquired is the only 
kind of knowledge which can properly be called ob- 
jective; while knowledge of every other kind is called 
subjective. To show the value of the former is the aim 
of the Criterion of Pure Reason. Kant, as has been said, 
distinguishes between pure and practical Self. That 
part of our idea which does not proceed from the thing 
observed, but from accidental association subsisting in 
our mind, is referred to the practical Self; and it is 
precisely this part of our idea which is subjective. 
When we have once learnt what portion of the idea is 
objective, it requires only to separate that with accu- 
racy, and whatever remains is subjective. In this way 
we get clear of that portion of our subjective knowledge 
which is occasioned by incorrect observations and con- 
clusions. It is true, that inasmuch as the nature of the 
affection of the mind depends upon the constitution of 
our organs of perception, it is practical or subjective 
appearance which we cannot separate, but this will not 
deceive such as understand the rules of philosophizing. 
The tolerant tone of this article is remarkable. More 
remarkable is the conclusion added by the compiler.. 
Though the account was taken from a mere note which 
Lange appended to his German translation of Stewart’s 
Elements, the American editor catches the drift of the 
critical philosophy. This much at least, he adds, will 
appear from this account, that Kant’s great doctrine 
is, that a knowledge of the human mind is not to be ob- 
tained by imagining changes in the mind itself, but by 
studying the various phenomena which it exhibits. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
  234 MODERN IDEALISM 
author himself compares his discovery to that of Coper- 
nicus, by which he showed that the phenomena of the 
heavenly bodies did not entitle us to attribute to them 
the various cyclar and epicyclar motions of the Ptolemaic 
system; that in truth we could be assured of nothing 
more than the existence of those bodies; and that the 
different changes in their appearance might as well be 
explained by supposing a change in our situation as by 
supposing any alteration in theirs. 
It is a decided surprise to discover the famous 
Copernican comparison noticed amongst us only a few 
years after the appearance of the Critique of Pure Rea- 
son. It is, however, unfortunate that it appeared in an 
ephemeral journal, in a place about to lose its intellec- 
tual supremacy, and at a time when men were not yet 
ready to shift their philosophical point of view,—to con- 
sider themselves not as satellites but as suns, from whom 
might come considerable rays of wisdom. It was left for 
the New England transcendentalists of a generation 
later to do this, for Pennsylvanians of German origin 
were not in a position to effect the Copernican revolu- 
tion in thought. In our republic of letters the Penn- 
sylvania ‘‘ Dutch ’’ were little affected by the literature 
of the storm and stress period and remained remote, un- 
friended, melancholy, slow. Moreover, the scholars of 
German origin had their limitations. Men like 
Schmucker, professor in a Gettysburg college, and 
Rauch, president of Marshall College, were not much 
known outside of their local Lutheran circles. And so 
when the literary leadership was shifted from Phila- 
delphia and the South to Boston and the North, that 
frigid air of condescension characteristic of New Eng- 
land nipped the growth of the foreign plants. The head 
of Yale College referred to Kantianism as subversive
-P-A-G-E-243
THE GERMAN INFLUENCES 235 
of morality ; and Harvard, although accepting a present 
of books from Goethe himself, feared the Germans even 
bearing gifts. 
There was, however, one voice crying in this wilderness 
of exclusiveness. We refer again to James Murdock 
and his Sketches of Modern Philosophy, especially 
among the Germans. Here he claims that the confound- 
ing of reason with understanding, and of ideas with 
conceptions by Locke and by most of the English, 
Seotch, and American writers since (though it was a 
natural consequence of supposing all human knowledge 
to be derived from sensations and reflections on them) 
has spread much obscurity and confusion—and con- 
tributed not a little to render the English language unfit 
for clear and conclusive reasoning on metaphysical 
subjects. This is one great reason why so many among 
us cannot understand and appreciate the writings of the 
German philosophers. Their clear, precise, and definite 
thoughts, the moment they are translated into English, 
become obscure, indefinite, and vague; because the lan- 
guage into which they are translated is so. It is true 
that the Germans have introduced a multitude of new 
technical terms into philosophy which sound very 
strange in our ears; and Kant in particular has been cen- 
sured, even by his own countrymen, for his excessive 
coinage: but if our language had appropriate terms for 
expressing the more necessary distinctions of thought, we 
might contrive some way to avoid the use of German 
technics, and yet convey to English minds the real views 
of the German writers. 
A notorious instance of the confusion of technical 
philosophic terms in the English language is given by 
Murdock in his description of the New England move- 
ment. He says that that species of German philosophy
-P-A-G-E-244
  236 MODERN IDEALISM 
which has sprung up among the Unitarian clergy of 
Massachusetts, and which is advocated especially in a 
recent periodical called the Dial, is known by the appel- 
lation Transcendentalism. The propriety, however, of 
the appellation may be questioned. Kant would certainly 
not apply it to this or to any similar system. He would 
denominate it transcendent, not transcendental. The 
difference according to his views is immense. Both 
terms indeed denote the surpassing or transcending of 
certain limits; but the limits surpassed are entirely dif- 
ferent. That is called transcendental which surpasses 
the limits of sensible or empirical knowledge and ex- 
patiates in the region of pure thought or absolute sci- 
ence. It is, therefore, truly scientific; and it serves to 
explain empirical truths, so far as they are explicable. 
On the other hand, that is called transcendent which not 
only goes beyond empiricism, but surpasses the bound- 
aries of human knowledge. It expatiates in the shad- 
owy region of imaginary truth. It is, therefore, falsely 
called science; it is the opposite of true philosophy. A 
balloon sent up by a besieging army to overlook the 
ramparts of a fortification, if moored by cables whereby 
its elevation, its movements, and its safe return into 
camp are secured, is a transcendental thing; but if cut 
loose from its moorings and left to the mercy of the 
winds, it is transcendent; it has no connection with 
anything stable, no regulator; it rises or descends, 
moves this way or that way at haphazard, and it will 
land no one knows where or when. Now, according to 
the critical philosophy, all speculations in physical sci- 
ence that attempt to go beyond phenomena, and all 
speculations on supersensible things which attempt to 
explain their essential nature, are transcendent; that is, 
they overleap the boundaries of human knowledge. In 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
  THE GERMAN INFLUENCES 237 
violation of these cautions, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel 
plunged headlong into such speculations, and yet called 
them transcendental; and the new German philosophers 
of Massachusetts follow their example. 
We bring forward these criticisms for a purpose. It 
is to show that the current confusion of technical terms 
displayed an ignorance of German philosophy at first 
hand. In other words, the influence of that philosophy 
had so far been indirect rather than direct, literary 
rather than historical. From abroad, Coleridge and 
Cousin had brought in the romantic stimulus, but it was 
couched in anything but exact terms. At home, mem- 
bers of the Transcendentalist Club and the Brook Farm- 
ers cared more for free thinking than for precise think- 
ing. Even Ripley’s Specimens of Foreign Standard 
Literature were utilized more for the ferment of reform 
than for accurate information. As Ripley himself de- 
clared: We need a philosophy like this to purify and 
enlighten our politics, to consecrate our industry, to 
cheer and elevate society. 
We now come to the question of the time of transition 
from the indirect to the direct study of Kant and his 
followers. Some have held that the direct study began 
with the return of the young American scholars from 
Goettingen in the ’20s. We believe that the change came 
much later. It was prepared for by the various ad- 
dresses, translations, and anthologies of the third decade 
of the century; but that decade did not emancipate the 
New England mind, nor open it to the freedom of for- 
eign thought. Indeed the year 1839 put a black mark 
in the history of Harvard. In that year came Emerson’s 
Divinity School Address, which was denounced by An- 
drews Norton, ‘‘ the pope of Unitarianism,”’ as ‘‘ the last 
form of infidelity.’’ But worse followed. In reproba-
-P-A-G-E-246
  238 MODERN IDEALISM 
tion of the views expressed in this address Emerson 
himself was exiled from his own college for fully a gen- 
eration. 
Now, that generation was one of preparation, not of 
full understanding. In the ’40s, for example, a transla- 
tion of Fichte’s Vocation of the Scholar was reprinted in 
Boston, but this, as Frothingham ironically observed, 
excited an interest among people who had neither sym- 
pathy with his philosophy nor intelligence to comprehend 
it. For such a lack of sympathy and of intelligence we 
have not far to seek. It was due in a great measure to 
what Santayana so aptly calls the genteel tradition, a 
tradition due to the union of church and college, to 
the belief that the teacher must come to the defense of 
the faith. Armstrong has pointed out the peculiar 
function of philosophy in the ‘‘ old American college ’’: 
After the student had been trained in the time-honored 
classics and mathematics, after he had learned his modi- 
cum of rhetoric and history and natural science, there 
remained the ‘‘ higher branches,’’ which were held not 
only to train him in scholarship but to fit him for prac- 
tical life. Political science would make him a good citi- 
zen; the evidences of Christianity would ground his re- 
ligious faith. Now, these evidences were bolstered up 
by correlated courses in natural theology, in mental and 
moral philosophy, and only occasionally in the history 
of philosophy. . . . Moreover, these courses were always 
prescribed and generally given by the clerical heads of 
the colleges. 
But the era of dogmatic soundness was at last suc- 
ceeded by the day of the impartial discussion of meta- 
physics. Then came the transition from the old order to 
the new. The centennial of our political independence 
marked the beginnings of our academic independence.
-P-A-G-E-247
THE GERMAN INFLUENCES 239 
By that time philosophy began to be studied as an elect- 
ive and for its own sake. Several causes were contribu- 
tory,—the general advance in higher education, the em- 
pirical conclusions poured in upon us by the scientists, 
and especially the influence of the progress of psycho- 
logical science. With us that science was distinctly an 
importation from Germany, and with the founding of 
our first psychological laboratory in 1876 there comes 
a definite date for direct German influence—in the East, 
at least. 
We make this qualification because of a forgotten fac- 
tor in our intellectual history. Two decades before 
German philosophy, diluted with dogma, was being 
taught at Harvard by Bowen, at Yale by Porter, at 
Princeton by McCosh, and at the University of Pennsyl- 
vania by Krauth,—long before this, the pure doctrines of 
Kant and his followers were being made familiar in the 
West. This is one of the characteristic surprises in the 
history of our culture, that out of the new land comes 
the new knowledge. It was in St. Louis that there came 
into being the first Kant class in America, the first na- 
tive translations of Fichte and Schelling, the first sys- 
tematic study of Hegel. Indeed at the very period when 
the Massachusetts transcendentalists were largely out- 
side of the pale of the church, largely out of sympathy 
with the colleges, there was being trained in Missouri a 
group of idealists who, by their freedom of thinking and 
philosophic knowledge, made the Concord school of 
philosophy possible. In fine, that later idealism, whose 
origin has been usually attributed to New England, had 
its impetus elsewhere. It was a paradoxical phenomenon. 
It was like one of our storms which, blowing from the 
northeast, has its real beginning in the southwest. To 
that quarter of the compass we now turn,
-P-A-G-E-248
  240 MODERN IDEALISM 
2. Tue St. Louis Scuoou: Winu1AM T. Harris 
It has been declared a remarkable fact that in a boom- 
ing Western city—almost on the borders of civilization— 
apparently almost wholly occupied with material things, 
there should have arisen one of the leading schools of 
idealism in America. This was the St. Louis school, 
which initiated our first systematic study of German 
thought, and led to the publication of our first meta- 
physical journal, The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. 
The movement can best be studied through the men who 
made it. These were three: Brockmeyer the oracle, Har- 
ris the interpreter, and Snider the historian of the 
movement. 
Of this triumvirate Brockmeyer is the most pic- 
turesque figure. Born in Germany, coming to this coun- 
try at the age of sixteen, he was expelled from a fresh- 
water Western college because of his free-thinking, and 
left for the East, where he became imbued with the New 
England teachings. But the fixed social order not suiting 
him he determined to become another Thoreau, to leave 
society and seek solitude. In this plan, he tells us, he 
had taken to heart the advice of Parmenides to the young 
Socrates: ‘‘ Be sure to educate and practice yourself 
in the so-called useless metaphysical hair-splitting while 
you are still young, lest the truth should escape you.’’ 
So Brockmeyer went West to the old hunting-ground of 
Daniel Boone, there built himself a log cabin, and with 
his dog as his sole companion, lived for several years 
supporting himself by hunting. He did this because 
with his gun he could procure in an hour enough food 
for the day, and have the rest of the time for working 
out the thoughts in his head. This Utopian scheme could 
not last. Therefore, resolving to provide himself with
-P-A-G-E-249
THE ST. LOUIS SCHOOL: WILLIAM T. HARRIS 241 
a competency for his old age, he came to St. Louis. It 
was there in the year 1858 that he accidentally met 
Harris, who describes this unconventional backwoods 
philosopher as even at that time a thinker of the 
same order of mind as Hegel, for even before reading 
much of the great idealist he had divined his chief 
ideas and the position of his system. On my first ac- 
quaintance with him, continues Harris, he informed me 
that Hegel was the great man among modern philoso- 
phers and that his larger Logic was the work to get. I 
sent immediately to Germany for it, and it arrived late 
in the year. Mr. Brockmeyer’s deep insights and his 
poetic power of setting them forth with symbols and 
imagery furnished me and my friends of those early 
years all of our outside stimulus in the study of Ger- 
man philosophy. He impressed us with the practicality 
of philosophy, inasmuch as he could flash into the ques- 
tions of the day, and even into the questions of the mo- 
ment, the highest insight of philosophy and solve their 
problems. Even the hunting of wild turkeys or squirrels 
was the occasion for the use of philosophy. Philosophy 
came to mean with us, therefore, the most practical of 
all species of knowledge. . . . We studied the dialectic 
of politics and political parties and understood how 
measures and men might be combined by this light. 
But our chief application of philosophy was to literature 
and art. 
To turn to Harris, the second of the triumvirate. 
Brockmeyer recounts how he met his foremost disciple 
at a chance meeting where those present were discussing 
Oriental theosophy, spiritualism, or something of that 
sort. The secretary of that meeting, he narrates, was a 
young man named Harris, who seemed to me to be the 
one sane person of the gathering. After the meeting I  
-P-A-G-E-250
242 MODERN IDEALISM 
accosted him and began to question him as we walked 
along. He seemed surprised that such a common work- 
ingman, as I appeared to be, should talk in this way, and 
we got into a discussion. He made some quotation from 
Cousin, and I remarked that Cousin contradicted him- 
self on every page. On his challenging this statement I 
accompanied him to his room to prove it from Cousin’s 
works. This was the beginning of our friendship, and 
the nucleus of the group of students that soon gathered 
together. 
Here was the beginning of the first systematic study 
of Hegel in the country. Brockmeyer tells how Harris 
and two other enthusiastic young men wished him to 
cease working in the foundry and give his time to in- 
structing them and to translating the great works of 
German thought. But the commencement of the Civil 
War, of which the first storm center was Missouri, inter- 
fered with this arrangement and broke up the little band 
of philosophers. Six months after Appomattox the 
philosophers met again. It was then that the third of 
the triumvirate appears upon the scene and gives his 
impressions of the other two: There was Brockmeyer, 
dishevelled and ragged in his working clothes, the un- 
doubted oracle of the meeting, who would forcibly de- 
liver his response as one having authority and could even 
re-create Hegel by poetizing the latter’s dry, colorless 
abstractions. There was Harris, the active worker of the 
philosophic set, the eager propagandist, who with his 
sharp face, and rather pointed nose, could prick keenly 
and deeply into things. The two men were in themselves 
an illustration of the Hegelian dialectic, a contrast and 
at the same time complementary to each other,—one the 
man of genius, but rather indolent; the other the man 
of talent and very industrious.
-P-A-G-E-251
THE ST. LOUIS SCHOOL: WILLIAM T. HARRIS 243 
The man of talent may now speak for himself. In 
one of our best philosophic autobiographies, Harris, the 
editor of Hegel’s Logic, sees in himself an illustration of 
that logic. In the unfolding of his life there were three 
““moments ’’; the first a phase of positivism; next, a 
conversion to transcendentalism; and lastly, a tran- 
scending of that transcendentalism. While a student at 
Yale College, Harris had taken up with phrenology and 
the eclecticism of Cousin. This was what he called his 
“* saurian ’’ period, when he was mixed up with that vast 
swarm of isms which had broken loose in New England, 
and, as Snider says, descended upon the West in count- 
less flights like Kansas grasshoppers. But just as Harris 
rebelled against the formalism of the college so did he 
rebel against this ‘‘ nibbling at the little end of things.’’ 
“‘ The long-haired men and short-haired women ’’ who 
wished to reform the world offhand were not to his taste. 
He wished for a guide out of the maze. He found it in 
idealism. He declares that he obtained his first insight 
into the new philosophy in studying Kant’s Critique of 
Pure Reason. Seeing the necessity of the logical in- 
ference that the unity of time and space presupposes one 
absolute Reason,—God, freedom, and immortality seemed 
to him to be demonstrable ever since that December even- 
ing in 1858 when he obtained his first insight into the 
true inference from the transcendental esthetic. 
This conversion to transcendentalism took place in the 
very year in which Harris met Brockmeyer. The latter 
now began to declare to his followers that they must go 
beyond transcendentalism ; that there was a greater than 
Kant; and that it was Hegel who was the culmination 
of the German philosophical movement. The practical 
Yankee took Brockmeyer at his word; sent to Germany 
for the Logic and, with Brockmeyer as oracle and ex-
-P-A-G-E-252
  244. MODERN IDEALISM 
pounder, made a definite beginning of the St. Louis 
movement. The city furnished good soil for the teach- 
ings of the great encyclopedist. At least in the eyes of 
the local thinkers it was an illustration of the Hegelian 
philosophy of history. First, the time was propitious. 
After the civil strife between North and South the recon- 
struction period offered an example of the harmonizing 
of opposing forces. Next, the place was likewise propi- 
tious. It was counted cosmopolitan and seemed altogether 
different from any other city of the land—more for- 
eign, more un-American in its conception of freedom. 
In it were descendants of the early French families that 
had settled there under Spanish and French rule, still 
retaining strong traces of the ancestral character. By 
the side of these was the very strong element of the 
Southerners, who possessed wealth, culture, and polish 
of manner, perhaps the most aristocratic element of the 
city. . . . The third class came from New England and 
the Middle States, and had brought with them culture, — 
energy, perseverance, and indomitable will-power. Many 
of them were professional and business men who had 
come westward to better themselves financially. Finally, 
political trouble in the various German states had sent 
tens of thousands into the Mississippi Valley, and St. 
Louis received her full quota of them, making her, con- 
cludes the historian of the movement, a Teutonic city 
of the radical type. 
In spite of these favoring circumstances, the movement 
as a whole, continues the same author, led to disappoint- 
ing results. The Philosophical Society was intended by 
Brockmeyer as a means for publishing his translation of 
Hegel’s larger Logic. But politics drew him aside and 
it was only long after his death that the task was 
completed by others. The same society was intended by
-P-A-G-E-253
  
THE ST. LOUIS SCHOOL: WILLIAM T. HARRIS 245 
Harris as a means for working up his Journal of Specu- 
lative Philosophy. In this periodical Brockmeyer’s writ- 
ings proved a disappointment. The manuscript of the 
log-cabin thinker required a vast deal of correction; that 
which seemed the utterance of genius to his followers 
suffered from a kind of evaporation in print. The 
Letters on Faust which sought to philosophize litera- 
ture were neither philosophy nor literature. Brock- 
meyer could never get himself nor his writings into 
shape. Yet the oracle of the school had a mission in 
inspiring the mind of the school,—Harris. How that 
mind developed is told by one of our Hegelians of the 
right wing in true Teutonic fashion. UHarris’s philo- 
sophical study in St. Louis from 1858 to 1867, says 
Sterrett, might be styled his Lehrjahre or Genesis; 
his editing the Journal of Speculative Philosophy and 
his work in the Concord school of philosophy for the 
second period, his Wanderjahre or Exodus, though his 
work in both of these spheres ran well into the period of 
his mastership, which culminated in his critical exposi- 
tion of his great master’s greatest work, the Logic 
of Hegel. Of this first stage mention has been made. 
It began with the study of philosophy on the low level 
of phrenology, and ended with the emergence from the 
toils of materialism and agnosticism in Harris’s criti- 
cism of Herbert Spencer. This criticism was sent to 
the North American Review and rejected as unreadable. 
The rejection had results. It led Harris to found his 
own Journal and to strive, and with no little success, to 
make his exposition of Hegel readable. 
With the founding of the Journal we have an emerg- 
ence into an intense idealism, together with an attempt 
to Americanize that idealism. The Journal’s motto, 
taken from Novalis, was this: ‘‘ Philosophy can bake no  
-P-A-G-E-254
  246 MODERN IDEALISM 
bread; but she can procure for us God, Freedom, and 
Immortality.’”’ The Journal’s preface was a call to 
found a true ‘‘ American ”’ type of speculative philos- 
ophy. We, as a people, declared the editor, buy im- 
mense editions of John Stuart Mill, Herbert Spencer, 
Comte, Hamilton, Cousin, and others; one can trace the 
appropriation and digestion of their thoughts in all 
the leading articles of our reviews, magazines, and books 
of a thoughtful character. If this is American philos- 
ophy, the editor thinks it may be very much elevated 
by absorbing and digesting more refined aliment. It is 
said that of Herbert Spencer’s works nearly twenty 
thousand have been sold in this country, while in Eng- 
land searcely the first edition has been bought. This is 
encouraging for the American thinker: what lofty spirit- 
ual culture may not become broadly and firmly rooted 
here where thoughtful minds are so numerous! Let this 
spirit of inquiry once extend to thinkers like Plato and 
Aristotle, Schelling and Hegel—let these be digested 
and organically reproduced—and what a phalanx of 
American thinkers we may have to boast of! For, after — 
all, it is not ‘‘ American thought ’’ so much as American 
thinkers that we want. To think, in the highest sense, is 
to transcend all natwral limits—such, for example, as na- 
tional peculiarities, defects in culture, distinctions in 
race, habits, and modes of living—to be universal, so 
that one can dissolve away the external hull and seize 
the substance itself. The peculiarities stand in the way ; 
were it not for these, we should find in Greek or German 
philosophy just the forms we ourselves need. Our proy- 
ince as Americans is to rise to purer forms than have 
hitherto been attained, and thus speak a ‘‘ solvent 
word ’’ of more potency than those already uttered. If 
this be the goal we aim at, it is evident that we can find

no other means so well adapted to rid us of our own 
idiosyncrasies as the study of the greatest thinkers of all 
ages and all times. May this Journal aid such a con- 
summation ! 
This declaration has a trace of the flamboyancy of the 
Middle West. It led, however, to certain valuable results. 
The Journal served as a medium for the first appearance 
in English of a large number of German productions, 
from Fichte’s Science of History and Hegel’s Philosophy 
of Art, to original contributions from Von Hartmann 
and Michelet. It also served as a forcing-bed for native 
philosophers, from idealists like Howison and Royce, 
to Peirce, the father of pragmatism, and James its chief 
expositor. But the main function of the early numbers 
of the Journal was as a vehicle of Harris’s own specula- 
tions. These are embodied in his Introduction to 
Philosophy, wherein he has answered, in the Hegelian 
way, the question asked by the reader of the Journal: 
“What is this speculative knowledge of which you 
speak? ’’ And he has done more; he has re-defined the 
objects of the St. Louis Society and laid out the pro- 
gramme for the Journal’s contributors. The Society, he 
explains, was not founded for the especial purpose of 
studying German philosophy from Kant to Hegel, but 
to encourage the study and development of speculative 
philosophy, to foster an application of its results to art, 
science, and religion, and to establish a philosophical 
basis for the professions of law, medicine, divinity, poli- 
ties, education, and literature. . . . This is a large pro- 
gramme. It reads like the inflated catalogue of one of 
our Western ‘‘ universities.’’ Yet in this very inflation 
there lay concealed one cardinal virtue—catholicity. 
Harris himself was an apostle of this spirit. Caught 
from the encyclopedic Hegel, he applied it to American
-P-A-G-E-256
  248 MODERN IDEALISM 
conditions and thereby became one of the clearest in- 
terpreters of our national consciousness. 
This was the time when men’s souls were tried. It 
was a period of reconstruction, not only in the state 
but also in the church. How then should the philosopher 
handle these paramount issues of politics and religion? 
Harris does it in the Hegelian way, by considering both 
sides, recognizing the opposing phases and aiming at 
totality. The national consciousness, he explains, has 
moved forward on to a new platform during the last 
few years. The idea underlying our form of government 
had hitherto ‘developed only one of its essential phases— 
that of brittle individualism—in which national unity 
seemed an external mechanism, soon to be entirely dis- 
pensed with, and the enterprise of the private man or of 
the corporation substituted for it. Now we have arrived 
at the consciousness of the other essential phase, and 
each individual recognizes his substantial side to be 
the state as such. The freedom of the citizen does not 
consist in the mere arbitrary, but in the realization of 
the rational conviction which finds expression in estab- 
lished law. That this new phase of national life demands 
to be digested and comprehended, is a further occasion 
for the cultivation of the speculative. 
So much for politics. In regard to religion Harris 
sees an immense movement going on in this country. The 
tendency to break with the traditional, and to accept 
only what bears for the soul its own justification, is 
widely active, and can end only in the demand that rea- 
son shall find and establish a philosophical basis for 
all those great ideas which are taught as religious 
dogmas. Thus it is that side by side with the naturalism 
of such men as Renan, a school of mystics is beginning 
to spring up who prefer to ignore utterly all historical
-P-A-G-E-257
  
THE ST. LOUIS SCHOOL: WILLIAM T. HARRIS 249 
wrappages, and cleave only to the speculative kernel 
itself. The vortex between the traditional faith and 
the intellectual conviction cannot be closed by renounc- 
ing the latter, but only by deepening it to speculative 
insight. 
The speculative insight for which Harris longed was 
given, in fullest measure, by that traveling priest of Neo- 
Platonic transcendentalism—Bronson Alcott, who was 
now invited to St. Louis, his farthest limit west. Al- 
cott’s influence in philosophy, declares Harris, was great, 
and his presence a powerful influence to stir into activity 
whatever philosophical thought there might be in a place. 
All people entering upon the stage of the ‘‘ clearing up,”’ 
or the intellectual declaration of independence, felt 
something congenial in the atmosphere of such a ‘‘ con- 
versation ’’ as he conducted. The idea of Neo-Platonism 
is so negative to our civilization that Mr. Alcott could 
hospitably entertain the thoughts of any come-outer, and 
offer him, in return, very surprising views, that flowed 
naturally enough from the theory of ‘‘ lapse,’’ but were 
found altogether ‘‘ occult ’’ by the modern sense that 
holds to the doctrines of evolution and progress. It 
was perhaps difficult for those who attended the conver- 
sations to name any one valuable idea or insight which 
they had gained there, but they felt harmoniously at- 
tracted to free-thinking, and there was a feeling that 
great stores of insight lay beyond what they had already 
attained. That a person has within him the power of 
growth in insight, is the most valuable conviction that 
he can acquire. Certainly this was the fruit of Mr. 
Alcott’s labors in the West. Ordinarily a person looks 
upon his own wit as a fixed quantity, and does not try 
a second time to understand anything found too difficult 
on the first trial. Alcott set people to reading Emerson
-P-A-G-E-258
  250 MODERN IDEALISM 
and Thoreau. He familiarized them with the names of 
Plato and Pythagoras as great thinkers whose ideas are 
valid now and to remain valid throughout the ages. The 
shallowness of the American is due to the hard-and-fast 
hold he has upon his knowledge of material or physical 
ways and means. He is engaged primarily in the con- 
quest of nature for the uses of civilization, and his in- 
tellectual energies are so fully occupied with this busi- 
ness that he has not explored the width and depth of 
the civilization for which he is producing the wealth. 
Thus it happens that American thought has for other 
nations a flavor of Philistinism. It is narrow and shal- 
low. The spiritual heavens are shrunk to the dimensions 
of a single horizon. There is no intimation that the 
American Philistine ever heard of any other point of 
view than his own. He has heard of different manners 
and customs, but all these are for him utterly irrational 
and without adequate motives. He believes that his 
form of democracy is the only form of government fitted 
for all mankind, and the wonders that all people do not 
at once adopt it, just as he has done. . . . Failing to un- 
derstand contemporary peoples, as the average American 
consciousness does, it is not surprising that there is 
a still worse defect in regard to the views of the world 
formed by the Greeks and Romans, the Persians and 
the Brahmins. It has been, therefore, a thing needed 
that we should have reproduced among us, after a hot- 
house mode, the ideas of other times and peoples that 
have performed their part in the long march of civiliza- 
tion. We have to learn the embryology of our civiliza- 
tion, and see the necessity for those stages which have 
been outworn, and comprehend what was of value, and 
what is still of value in them. The Hast Indian litera- 
ture, the Chinese, the Persian, and especially the Egyp-

tian, all shall be brought near to us, and our minds 
endlessly enriched by their lessons. Instead of our little 
barred window, which lets in a glimmer of light at the 
top of our cell, we shall then go forth into the free air, 
and contemplate the entire sky and all its light. We shall 
then for the first time see the real significance of our 
own work as founders of a new nation in a new world. 
We have given this remarkable passage at length for 
two reasons. In the first place, it illustrates Harris’s 
skillful use of the Hegelian necessity of negativity. In 
his Orphic Sayings Alcott presented, as we have seen, 
the Neo-Platonic view of the world, and thus gave to his 
contemporaries the shock they needed. This is evident 
by the uproar of ridicule and indignation which ensued. 
American common-sense and Fourth-of-July democracy 
had never considered the possibility of any other view 
of the world than its own. In the next place, the pas- 
sage illustrates Harris’s understanding of what he calls 
the morphology of our civilization and the significance 
of the embryology of the transcendental movement. 
While the most of the men of our time, he continues, 
despise the ‘‘ embryons’’ which had developed into 
their present life, to one man—the wisest of his genera- 
tion—this was an opportunity not to be neglected. That 
man was Emerson. He could find much sympathy with 
any and all idealistic views—whether European or 
Asiatic. Even the unrelenting theory of the Brahmins, 
which makes all existence an illusion, had its poetic uses 
for him. . . . Emerson kept this stalwart form of 
idealism as a sort of medicine which he could produce 
on oceasions when confronted with the Gorgon of ma- 
terialism in any new shape: What do I care, he exclaims, 
for the iron mills, or the slums of cities, or the cholera, 
or the Fugitive Slave Law, or some traveling crank,  
-P-A-G-E-260
  252 MODERN IDEALISM 
when I can see that all in time and space is only maya, 
or illusion ? 
From these passages we are justified in putting a 
high estimate upon the head of the St. Louis school. As 
Emerson was the interpreter of nature, so may we claim 
for Harris the title of the interpreter of the thought of 
his country, whether East or West. At this point we 
return to a previous suggestion regarding that confluence 
of currents which resulted in the Concord school. In 
that school Harris was a notable figure. To it he brought 
two things, enthusiasm and executive ability. The 
“* philosophic fury ’’ of his youth had not yet died down; 
in addition he possessed what he liked to consider a 
marked characteristic of the American—‘‘ directive 
force.’? Through these two factors there was now 
brought together a notable gathering of native philoso- 
phers. The dean of the school was the fiery-eyed Alcott, 
through whom had come the day of some really radical 
thinking. The secretary of the school was Sanborn, 
who was to give us our first brief glimpse of the history 
of speculation in America. This included the Puritanic 
philosophy of Edwards, the philanthropic philosophy 
of Franklin, the negation of philosophy (the period of 
deadening realistic dogmatism), and the ideal or vital 
philosophy of Emerson. Now, Emerson, though still 
living, was practically canonized as the Sage of Con- 
cord. Men really looked upon him as the great repre- 
sentative of our early national period, when, as Sanborn 
says, philosophy indicated the guide of life, the exponent 
and directress of national existence, rather than a cer- 
tain metaphysical insight, fruitful of speculation, even 
when barren of results. 
But the times had changed. After the Civil War there 
arrived a speculative stage. The interest in abolition
-P-A-G-E-261
    THE ST. LOUIS SCHOOL: WILLIAM T. HARRIS 253 
was supplanted by an interest in the Absolute. Under 
the German influences there arose the aim of thought for 
thought’s sake; the new generation was enamored of 
metaphysical subtlety and cultivated an air of detach- 
ment. The change was one both of method and of spirit 
and the programme of the Concord school is an index of 
that change. For example, Harris offers four lectures 
on Elementary Insights in Philosophy and four more on 
Space and Time; Causality and Self-Cause; Faith and 
Freedom ; and Categories of Being. Nevertheless an audi- 
ence from the land of practicality could not give itself 
entirely up to such abstract speculations, nor make an un- 
conditional surrender to the unconditioned. So alongside 
of Harris’s special subjects, such as The Absolute as a 
Personal Reason, and The World as Revelation of the 
Divine First Cause, we find those of another complexion. 
If Harris aimed toward monism, Howison represented the 
other wing of Kantian idealism; while James’s lectures 
on psychology contained certain pluralistic germs which 
were bound to upset any system boasting of its stability. 
Indeed it would appear that idealism already contained 
in its body certain anti-bodies, by-products leading to a 
kind of auto-intoxication which intense transcendental- 
ism seems ever destined to develop. But full develop- 
ment had not yet come. It is a fact that, in the very 
year of the founding of the Concord school, Charles 
Peirce suggested ‘‘ certain incapacities of human 
thought ’’ which led to the disintegrating skepticism of 
pragmatism. In the meanwhile, before that disintegrat- 
ing skepticism could be reached, there arose two forms of 
involved monism which we shall have to consider. These 
are what we shall call Royce’s system of romantic ideal- 
ism and Ladd’s system of science and idealism. To these 
two masters, at Harvard and at Yale, we now turn.

254 MODERN IDEALISM 
3. Romantic IpEauism: JosAH Royce 
| Josiah Royce represents the romantic side of our 
modern thinking. He is the Ulysses of an idealistic 
epic,—‘‘ many are the men whose towns he has seen and 
whose minds he has learnt.’’ By birth he stands for 
the adventurous spirit of the California pioneer; by 
training, for the learning of the Eastern seaboard as it 
was brought from Europe. A student in Baltimore, his 
early articles appeared in the St. Louis Journal; a 
teacher for many years at Harvard, he has been called 
to lecture at Aberdeen and at Oxford. From the variety 
and amplitude of his studies in metaphysics and mathe- 
matics, in psychology and religion, he is peculiarly quali- 
fied to interpret ‘‘ the spirit of modern philosophy.’’ 
That spirit may be summed up in one word,—romanti- 
cism. This has as its chief activities the cultivation of 
the inner life; an enlargement of the powers of per- 
sonality; and a cosmic imagination which strives to 
express all phenomena in terms of the Infinite, the Abso- 
lute. By the first activity, man learns to free his spirit 
from the limitations of the body; to discover that the 
true world is not made up of sense impressions. By the 
next activity, he expands his mind until well-nigh the 
whole world is at his feet, even time and space. By the 
final activity, he finds that the finite world is a voluntary 
limitation on the part of his infinite ego and that only 
what is linked with the Infinite has meaning and value. 
Such, briefly, is romanticism as interpreted by Novalis 
and Fichte and Schlegel. Of like mind is Royce, who 
puts the matter in a less vague and more satisfactory 
form because of the wealth of learning at his disposal. 
He begins by showing that there are two aspects of ideal- 
ism. The first is an analysis which consists in pointing
-P-A-G-E-263
  ROMANTIC IDEALISM: JOSIAH ROYCE ~— 255 
out that the world of your knowledge is through and 
through such stuff as ideas are made of. The other aspect 
is the one which gives us our notion of the absolute 
Self. To it the first is only preparatory, for this world 
which we interpret in terms of our ideas exists in and 
for a standard, an universal mind whose system of 
ideas constitutes the world. Now, all this may be mere 
speculative boasting. I may believe that the infinite con- 
scious Self is alone sure, but I have to give a reason for 
this faith. Berkeley has made the method familiar when 
he reasons that ‘‘ this whole choir of heaven and furni- 
ture of earth is nothing but a system of ideas.’”?. . . 
But I must state it in my own way, although one in vain 
seeks novelty in illustrating so frequently described a 
view. 
Here, then, is our so real world of the senses, full of 
light and warmth and sound. If anything could be 
solid and external, surely, one at first will say, it is this 
world. Hard facts, not mere ideas, meet us on every 
hand. Ideas anyone can mold as he wishes. Not so 
facts. In idea socialists can dream out Utopias, dis- 
appointed lovers can imagine themselves successful, beg- 
gars can ride horses, wanderers can enjoy the fireside 
at home. In the realm of facts, society organizes itself 
as it must, rejected lovers stand for the time defeated, 
beggars are alone with their wishes, oceans roll drearily 
between home and the wanderer. 
Matter and mind may be similar in being stubborn, 
but does this make them essentially alike? We raise 
this question because idealists before this have been apt 
to slip into the fallacy of putting a part for the whole, or 
more precisely of confusing quality with totality. 
Royce guards against all this. Much of the outer world, 
he explains, is ideal: the coin or the jewel or the bank-
-P-A-G-E-264
  256 MODERN IDEALISM 
note or the bond has its value not alone in its physical 
presence, but in the idea that it symbolizes to the be- 
holder’s mind, or to the relatively universal thought of 
the commercial world. So part of the properties of the 
objects yonder in this bright sense-world of ours is ideal, 
for odors and tastes and temperatures do not exist in 
those objects in just the way in which they exist in us. 
Thus for temperatures, a well-known experiment will 
show how the same water may seem cold to one hand 
and warm to the other. So for colors, they are not in 
the things, since they change with the light, vanish in 
the dark, and differ for different eyes. And as for 
sounds they exist in nature only as voiceless sound- 
waves trembling through the air. 
These are familiar arguments and easy to accept. But 
can we follow the idealist in his supposition that part 
of the being of these properties is ideal, if not all of it; 
or, at the best, that such being is the embodiment of the 
thought or purpose of some world-mind? There are here 
two forward steps, one of which appears doubtful, the 
other dogmatic, unless the very dogma serve as a vindica- 
tion of this train of reasoning. To explain: If we sup- 
pose that the place of all sense qualities is in the world- 
mind, then we have, as Royce suggests, a standard 
thought of which ours is only the copy. If this be not 
so, we are faced with this dilemma: Either your real 
world yonder is through and through a world of ideas, 
an outer world that you are more or less comprehending 
through your experience, or else, in so far as it is real 
and outer it is unknowable, an inscrutable x, an abso- 
solute mystery. There is no third alternative. Hither 
a mind yonder, or else the unknowable; that is your 
choice. 
We confess that this dogma relieves the dilemma, but  
-P-A-G-E-265
  
ROMANTIC IDEALISM: JOSIAH ROYCE — 257 
does it give one ‘‘ the sensation of being an idealist ’’? 
The author himself raises such a question as this: Is 
not this result very disheartening? My world is thus 
a world of ideas, but alas! how do I then ever reach those 
ideas of the minds beyond me? This question is one 
that has been called by one of the new realists the ego- 
centric predicament. It may be put in this way: I may 
grant that knowledge is made up of ideas, but are they 
not my ideas and, therefore, am I not shut up in the 
magic circle of my own mind? Royce faces the predica- 
ment and seeks to solve it in this wise: The answer is 
simple, but in one sense a very problematic one. You, 
in one sense, never do or can get beyond your own ideas, 
nor ought you to wish to do so, because in truth all those 
other minds that constitute your outer and real world 
are in essence one with your own self. This whole 
world of ideas is essentially one world, is essentially the 
world of one self and That art Thou. 
The answer here suggested is made by means of a tran- 
sition from the solipsistic to the social. Yet by what 
right have we thus to pass from the individual to the 
common consciousness? Ordinary judgment makes the 
social or common consciousness merely the aggregate of 
individual minds; just as the ‘‘ population ’’ of a coun- 
try is merely the sum-total got by counting heads. The 
statistician no more thinks that the adding together of 
little minds makes one great mind, than the strict con- 
structionist thinks that the addition of political states 
makes an extra entity called ‘‘ The Union.’’ But the 
idealist reasons differently. He is neither statistician 
nor strict constructionist. To get out of the little circle 
of the single self he is wont to call on a larger self,— 
the social consciousness, the spirit of the times, the 
World-Mind,—whatever may be the name given to this
-P-A-G-E-266
  258 MODERN IDEALISM 
mysterious One who ‘‘ relieves us from dilemmas, and 
saves us from predicaments.’’ 
We confess that we find it hard to follow this line of 
argument, for it involves a kind of cosmic conceit, a con- 
viction that in the evolution of the Absolute, the unfold- 
ing of the Spirit, we mortals play a major part. Yet 
Royce goes on to declare that such participation exists 
in the very act of belief, for to believe anything is to 
stand in a real relation to truth, a relation which tran- 
scends wholly my present, momentary self; and this real 
relation is of such a curious nature that only a larger 
inclusive self which consciously reflected upon my mean- 
ing and consciously possessed the object which I mean, 
could know or grasp the reality of the relation. 
If we were to defend this idealistic analysis, we might 
say that the act of knowing, being a relating process 
between the individual and the object, requires some con- 
necting medium. As no wireless message can be con- 
veyed between two points without the intangible ether, 
so must the knower and the known be bathed in a cir- 
cumambient Absolute. This, in a figure, is what the au- 
thor may mean when he refers to ‘‘ that larger Self 
that includes you and your object.’? William James 
has disposed of this assumption in the matter-of-fact 
statement that a third party is not needed; that a cat 
may look at a king directly, and without the interven- 
tion of anything or anybody. But for the idealist this is 
too flat and unprofitable. It may be possible to live along 
on the easy path of simple awareness; but for a specu- 
lative system we require a more complicated scheme. 
Between the self and objects no help may be needed 
“for a relating power from on high; but between self 
and other selves there is a more mysterious relation. 
The kinship of mind is due to a common origin and a
-P-A-G-E-267
  ROMANTIC IDEALISM: JOSIAH ROYCE — 259 
common essence. Such may well be Royce’s ‘‘ one Self, 
organically, refiectively, consciously inclusive of all the 
selves,—the divine Logos which is absolutely the only 
sure thing from the first about this world.’’ 
To Royce, as to Schelling, man is a member of two 
worlds; but unlike the German idealist, who sought to 
preserve a perfect balance between the two, the Ameri- 
can apparently thinks that by depreciating the world of 
description he thereby appreciates, or adds in value to, 
the world of appreciation. Without the facts of appre- 
ciation, he claims, there are no laws of description. 
Destroy the organic and appreciable unity of the world 
of appreciative beings, and the describable objects all 
vanish,—atoms, brains, suns, and milky ways are naught. 
. . Is this Roycean paradox an apparent reversal of 
judgment? At first it was stated that the universe of 
appreciative feelings was isolated; that feelings and 
emotions were strictly private and, therefore, non- 
transferable. Now it is stated that objects in space and 
time are isolated, but that spiritual states are enmeshed 
in a common net of spiritual relationship. 
Here is a return to the notion of a social conscious- 
ness, the world of appreciation being, as the writer ex- 
presses it, one of a sort of reflective publicity and 
interconnectedness. What is the value of this world? As 
minds are above molecules, so, it is argued, the world of 
appreciation is the deeper reality, its rival, the world of 
description, being a result of an essentially human and 
finite outlook. At this juncture there appears a defect 
in the system,—it is that of being a one-sided scheme. 
The admirable balance preserved by Schelling between 
the two worlds here gives way to the preponderance of 
the one over the other. This being so, Royce is forced 
to acknowledge that ‘‘ the unity of the Logos is an ap- 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
  260 MODERN IDEALISM 
preciable, but not a describable unity.’’? Certain un- 
comfortable consequences arise from this distinction: 
If the unity applies to but one world, it is not a total 
unity ; it may apply to the higher part, but that is not 
the whole. There remains the world of description, a 
mass of intractable matter, and the final result is a dual- 
ism. Man is a member of two worlds, but between the 
two worlds there is no organic connection. The idealist 
acknowledges as much in calling his scheme an applica- 
tion of the double-aspect theory. Unlike other forms of 
that theory which declares that there is a curious kind 
of substance in the world, a substance mysterious and 
essentially inscrutable that has two aspects, the mental 
and the physical, this theory, contends the author, under- 
takes to know what this substance is. It is the conscious 
life of the Logos, whereof my friend is a finite instance. 
What I see is the physical, phenomenal aspect of his 
inner and appreciative life. 
In using the word phenomenal Royce appears half 
an agnostic. The body, he claims, is merely a very im- 
perfect translation of the mind; its laws belonging not 
to the inner nature as such, but to the external show of 
this nature; these laws being but symbols of deeper 
truth. If the problem rested here we might contend 
that the idealist has laid himself open to the inroads of 
skepticism, the possibility of erroneous judgment in the 
search for truth. His show might be considered a vain 
show, his translation a mistranslation. For all that the 
finite intelligence knows, the double aspect might be a 
duplex aspect, or rather an aspect of duplicity. In 
other words, if the two worlds are not in balance, be- 
cause not codrdinate, if the material and spiritual are 
not of an equivalence, there might ensue a colossal 
equivocation. The outward and visible signs might be
-P-A-G-E-269
  ROMANTIC IDEALISM: JOSIAH ROYCE — 261 
misread, the symbols variously distorted according to 
the personal equation of the observer. This, we hold, 
is the danger run by the phenomenalist ; but to the meta- 
physical idealist, who strives to think things through, 
there is a further refuge from doubt. The finite intelli- 
gence must be wholly of an agnostic cast unless the indi- 
vidual constructs something higher than himself. This 
is the infinite intelligence. 
Royce had once avowed that the idealist welcomed 
the fullest agnosticism. We can now see the reason for 
this. Agnosticism is a spur to knowledge. Like a trav- 
eler in a strange land, the idealist in this material world 
is forced to learn the language of the country, to inter- 
pret the gestures which nature makes to him. Behind 
the signs, the symbols, the movements, there must be a 
meaning. It is this confidence in the rationality of the 
universe that constitutes the refuge of the high idealist. 
Royce has perhaps seemed to beg the question in using 
the term Logos, Reason. Now comes his vindication 
of the use of that term: You have your choice of three 
things. There is blank agnosticism, which makes the 
universe irredeemably irrational, a mere bedlam of nerv- 
ous jerks, of meaningless motions. There is also a partial 
agnosticism, where the scientific observer is never sure 
that his reading of signs is not a misreading, his trans- 
lation of facts not a mistranslation. There is finally a 
choice of a reasoned gnosticism,—not the universe of 
the know-it-all, but the universe of the All-Knower. The 
last is the choice of Royce. He allows that the world of 
description may be a world of partial doubt, that there 
may be a misreading of the mind of nature similar to a

-P-A-G-E-270

nated. But this correction, this elimination, cannot 
come of ourselves alone. The individual needs not only 
the social consciousness but the world consciousness. 
The problem, then, concerns a certain kind of truth, 
of which there are three kinds. Having recognized our- 
selves as finite beings, we become aware of our private 
world of inner truth as distinguishable from the truth 
as experienced by other men, and from the universal 
truth of. the all-knowing world-consciousness. A new 
question then arises: How much of this private 
truth of ours is a revelation to us in our finitude of what 
other finite selves can also know? Finally comes the 
answer: So much as can be described to these other finite 
selves, and then, in their experience, appreciatively veri- 
fied, may be regarded as not our private content, but as 
universal. 
We have at last reached a true transcendentalism ; 
a scale of truth which implies a scale of being, that is, 
a series of spheres in which the ardent soul may make 
real progress. By this means the transcendentalist 
breaks out of the magic circle of the self into the social 
consciousness, and then from the social consciousness 
into the higher consciousness of the ‘‘ true World-Will.’’ 
Such is the process of development in the realm of 
knowledge. There yet remains the problem of the rela- 
tion of the organie world to our human consciousness. 
Here the author is, in a measure, obliged to modify his 
previous declarations. In his literal appreciation, or 
increasing the value, of the world of appreciation he 
had tended to depreciate the world of description. That 
world he must now bring into his total scheme, and 
thereby raise to a higher power. When, he explains, 
I think of the stars and of matter, of space and of the 
energy that appears forever to be dissipating itself

ROMANTIC IDEALISM: JOSIAH ROYCE ~— 263 
therein, I think of something real, or else of merely a 
private experience of mine. If, now, the common experi- 
ence of humanity is our sufficient warrant for assuming 
some universal reality as actually embodied in these 
hot stars and cold interspaces, of what sort must this 
reality be? In and for itself, we now answer: It must 
be an appreciable reality, the expression of what, in 
Schopenhauer’s sense of the word, may be called a 
World-Will; as well as of what, in Hegel’s sense, may 
be called an Universal Self-Conscious Thought. 
Given these two worlds, and there is suggested an an- 
swer to the last and most difficult problem,—that of 
personal freedom. The transcendentalist may have his 
feet in the mire of matter, but his head is in the free 
air of the spirit. Such, in a figure, is Royce’s answer, 
and the answer, he admits, seems paradoxical. Granted 
that the cause that relates to the world of description is 
one of temporal sequences, and that the only cause that 
you can seek in the world of appreciation is in a very 
different sense a cause, namely, a justification for this 
or that act,—does this relieve the situation? The double 
aspect theory has seemingly degenerated into an aspect 
of duplicity, if not of equivocation. A word means one 
thing here and another there. Moreover it makes man 
apparently a creature of caprice, constant to one thing 
never; one foot on the land of fixed necessity, the other 
on the shifting sea of freedom. How shall the idealist 
escape such criticism? He does it as have other roman- 
ticists, by practically denying one kind of personal voli- 
tion. He concedes that what the physical organism it- 
self will do, is physiologically determined by the whole 
order of nature and by the whole of past time, and that 
the will moves no atom of this mechanism aside from 
its predestined force. How explain such a paradox?
-P-A-G-E-272
  264 | MODERN IDEALISM 
The answer is the expected answer. Royce, as a strict 
dualist, is a strict parallelist, and therefore allows no 
interaction between mind and body in the world of de- 
scription. 
In like manner, in the world of appreciation, he 
allows no interaction, in the way of control, between 
the individual mind and other minds. As my will can- 
not move the body below it, so a higher will cannot 
move my will, unless I choose to follow, by an act 
of appreciation, some thought emanating from that 
higher Self. We conceive the answer to the problem of 
freedom should stop here, with what is practically a 
revival of the Platonic doctrine of participation. This 
doctrine teaches that the lesser partakes ideally of the 
greater, the ectype being of the same nature as the 
archetype. Now, in attempting to bring our thoughts 
into conformity with that of the supreme Self, we may 
be in an ideal relation, which at any time we are at 
liberty to break. Yet we are hardly, as Royce contends, 
conscious bits of that Self, nor is our conscious volition 
a fragment of the freedom of the World-Will. We raise 
the objection that to identify an act of the individual 
with that of the Absolute, is to make the individual lose 
his personal identity. It is like an inventor working 
for a corporation and thereby losing all patent rights to 
his invention. Royce acknowledges as much in a final 
rhetorical question: What then, though we are bound 
in the temporal world, may we not indeed be free,— 
yes, and in a non-temporal and transcendent sense ef- 
fective, too, in the eternal world? May we not in fact, 
as parts of an eternal order, be choosing not indeed this 
or that thing in time, but helping to choose out and out 
what world this fatal temporal world shall eternally 
be and have been?
-P-A-G-E-273
IDEALISM AND SCIENCE 265 
With what he modestly calls a ‘‘ dim suggestion ’’ 
Royce concludes the constructive part of this ‘‘ first 
sketch ’’ of his system. The suggestion harks back to 
the German romanticists as poets, makers, world-builders. 
It also points forward to the current doctrine of creative 
evolution, where the universe is still in the making, and 
man a junior partner in the business. Or, to use a less 
commercial figure, this final suggestion preserves the 
Roycean system from the fate of absolutism. As in the 
case of philosophy and politics, where absolute sov- 
ereignty was forced to give way to personal sovereignty, 
so in this case. The seemingly insidious inroad on the 
liberties of the individual is prevented by the doctrine 
of voluntary participation of the free agent. Just as 
there may be a political union which conserves the re- 
served rights of the state, so may there be organic 
spiritual relations whereby ‘‘ all the spirits are together 
in one Spirit.’’ 
4, IDEALISM AND ScIENCE: GEorGE TRUMBULL Lapp 
The system of Royce is like a lofty palace with cloud- 
capped pinnacles and lofty towers, but withal built upon 
an insubstantial footing. The system of Ladd is a struc- 
ture of a different sort. While Royce ‘‘ a stately pleas- 
ure dome decrees,’’ Ladd prosaically sets to work to 
dig deep foundations. On the one hand is the romanti- 
cist with high poetic imagination; on the other is the 
engineer of metaphysics, who will erect no edifice until 
he has carefully examined the ground, who will make no 
promises until he has calculated the stresses and strains. 
The foundations of philosophy, according to Ladd, are 
wide and deep. They cover all the sciences and go down 
as far as investigation has gone. It is, therefore, pre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  266 MODERN IDEALISM 
sumptuous to call philosophy the science of the sciences; 
it should rather be considered a summation of the sci- 
ences. Just as an immense modern business structure calls 
in the geologist, the engineer, the architect, and a host of 
allied agents, so that skyscraper called metaphysics is 
impossible without the aid of all knowing men. Unless 
it avail itself of their services and reach the rock bottom 
of reality, it will be not only uninhabitable, but will 
collapse of its own weight. Such, in a figure, is the im- 
pression conveyed by Ladd’s latest work, Knowledge, 
Life, and Reality. The work is compact and well built, 
but like the modern business structure the first glimpse 
of it is not particularly alluring. Thus we are told 
that philosophy should be taken seriously, and that re- 
flective thinking is a duty. With this we beg to differ. 
It is opposed to the very meaning of the word in ques- 
tion. When the author points out that philosopher 
means a lover of knowledge, that also means that he is 
a lover of pleasure,—the pleasure of knowing. The 
compelling curiosity of which Aristotle spoke is the real 
motive behind speculation. The Greeks were right. 
Philosophy is not so much a duty as a pleasure, and a 
philosopher not so much an agonizing contestant, as a 
spectator at the games. There is, of course, a serious 
side to this. One’s favorite may fail and the race be 
lost, but this does not keep one away from the next 
Olympiad. We, therefore, beg to maintain that men do 
not enter into metaphysics ‘‘ discreetly and soberly,’’ 
but with curiosity and excitement. A prolegomenon to 
metaphysics is like a prologue to a play,—it is a spur 
to expectancy. A stranger in the land of speculation 
is as one who enters by night into a foreign city and 
wonders how it will look by daylight. 
Although differing as to the spirit with which philos-
-P-A-G-E-275
  IDEALISM AND SCIENCE 267 
ophy should be approached, we can agree as to the 
author’s general conception of the subject. His first 
point is a disavowal of dogma. The philosopher who 
knows his business, knows that the attempt to deduce 
the facts and laws of the positive sciences from some 
form of a theory of the Idea, or of the Absolute, must 
be forever abandoned. He also knows that philosophy 
must take the world as science finds it, for it is the real 
world, and not any merely conjectured world, which 
philosophy desires to help science more profoundly to 
interpret. The philosopher is, accordingly, not a domi- 
nator but an adjudicator. He does not aspire to be the 
president of a syndicate which shall have bought or 
grabbed up all the separate mining claims. He tries 
to straighten out the confusion in respect to these claims. 
This is difficult because the confusion is cosmic. The 
universe being a whole, of which each science presents 
a part, every particular science finds itself confronted. 
with problems which belong to the domain of some other 
science. Physics and chemistry cannot be kept wholly 
apart; chemistry is part of biology; biology is compli- 
cated with psychology, and so on. 
Into this Wild West of conflicting claims enters the 
philosopher. He himself has staked no claims and repre- 
sents no company, but like a government expert he is 
there to straighten out the tangle. He cannot satisfy 
everybody, yet he can send back a fairly clear report to 
headquarters. The report is accompanied by a map, and 
this map of metaphysics is now presented to us. There 
are in the field two rival companies. One is realism, the 
other idealism. How shall they be reconciled? By the 
simple expedient of a hyphen are the rivals amalga- 
mated. Like a British-American mining company, we 
have, therefore, two parties—one furnishing the capital, 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
  268 MODERN IDEALISM 
the other the brains. Now, if this were a wild-cat com- 
pany, we might have one party absconding with the 
capital and the other left with—the experience! But 
the company is legitimate and tries to do a legitimate 
business. It may ultimately attempt to be absolute— 
in that rosy future when it shall have absorbed all rivals. 
At present it sticks to its territory and tries to dig ore. 
In other words, the sources of philosophy are not chiefly 
subjective. A synthesis of facts, not a printing of pro- 
spectuses, is the task of the present-day philosopher, since 
there lies before the thinker of modern type a whole new 
world of discoveries. 
In both methods and materials philosophy should then 
be empirical. Conversely, the sciences should be theoret- 
ical. Just as the sciences interpenetrate one another, so 
philosophy should interpenetrate the sciences. Other- 
wise we fall into the strange illusions of which Haeckel 
complains, the illusion held by the physicists that they 
can construct the edifice of natural science from facts 
without a philosophical connection of the same. Ladd, 
as is his wont, substantiates his opinions by German 
thought. It might be supplemented by French views, 
views such as those of Poincaré, that science and hypoth- 
esis go hand in hand, that the one cannot advance with- 
out the instrumentality of the other. And yet the Ameri- 
can author might have reached his conclusion without 
any foreign aid, for his premises lead to the logical con- 
clusion that specialization should be corrected by syn- 
thesis, that the breaking up of the larger domain into 
small allotments should not go on forever. ‘‘ Divide 
and rule’’ is held to be an excellent maxim for the 
sake of concentration. Yet beside the intensive culti- 
vation possible within the fenced lines of specialization 
there is an extensive cultivation of which science itself
-P-A-G-E-277
  
“IDEALISM AND SCIENCE 269 
gives the hint every time it speaks of a Universe, or of a 
World, which is in any manner or measure One. 
With these distinctions in mind we may inquire to 
what school we should assign the author. He wishes 
it to be understood that he belongs to none, and yet to 
all. He sees that variety in philosophy is a sign of life, 
just as variety in crops is a sign of fertility. In these 
conclusions the cosmopolite speaks. Having taught in 
Japan and India, as well as in different parts of America, 
Ladd informs us that he has learned much from his own 
pupils, both Oriental and Occidental. But he is satisfied 
neither with the mystical cry of the East, nor with the 
scientific formulas of the West. The dissatisfaction 
being profound, the crisis becomes acute. This crisis is 
emphasized and with a purpose, namely, that the allevia- 
tion may be the greater. It is by compromise, as a sort 
of adhesive plaster, that the torn wound is at last brought 
together. If neither a purely idealistic nor a purely 
realistic system of philosophy can be maintained, yet 
a combination of the two may hold. The combination 
is found in what might be entitled a vitalizing of the 
problem. In the body-mind controversy we have in 
theory two conflicting elements; but in the living self 
we find the two united. Likewise in the larger contro- 
versy respecting matter and spirit: Why should not man 
interpret the universe as a totality, in terms of reality 
as experienced by himself, that is to say, in terms of an 
experience of the life of a self? In the knowledge of 
life we have a suggested solution of reality. We are 
now enabled to go a step further. In vitalizing the 
given elements we look from without upon a given whole 
—hbodies and minds brought together. In psychologizing 
those elements we go deeper and look from within— 
upon a rational whole. In a word, the principle of
-P-A-G-E-278
  270 MODERN IDEALISM 
knowledge is personalism. As one knows his body 
and mind united in a single self, so may one know 
the body of nature as infused with one immanent 
mind, 
This is going too fast. Before we can approach the 
philosophy of nature we must work out a philosophy 
of human nature. In this field the first problem is what 
kind of knowledge I have of myself. Is it illusory and 
transitory, or actual and dependable? Ladd gives the 
old realistic answer: I look within and find myself pos- 
sessed of a self which is immediate and indubitable. 
Such knowledge has this further advantage: it makes 
me sure of myself. And so, for one thing, I am no 
stream of consciousness, since, even as a figurative 
watcher on the banks, I really do not separate myself 
from that stream. Such are the arguments of the idealist 
of Yale College. For the sake of the contrast let us 
turn for a moment to representatives of the rival insti- 
tution against which these contentions are evidently 
directed. Against self-knowledge as immediate and in- 
dubitable we can put the statements of Royce as to the 
relativity and insecurity of such knowledge. To a path- 
ological case how futile would be the advice ‘‘ To thine 
own self be true ’’! Moreover, against the substantial 
identity of the self we can put the doctrine of James, 
which substitutes for a self a so-called ‘‘ stream of con- 
sciousness.’’ A favorite phrase of Ladd’s is that ‘‘ states 
of consciousness do not constitute consciousness of 
states.’? But suppose we add ‘‘—unless that conscious- 
ness of states is one of the states of consciousness.’’ The 
problem is puzzling, but Royce in turn has given a 
subtle answer to that very question of how the true mind 
may find itself. It is by making its way through a med- 
ley of parasitical ‘‘ minds,’’ abnormal states of conscious- ee ren Teen eT eR eN Ce Reon he ree ee OR Re ee Ny nie ene
-P-A-G-E-279
ee IDEALISM AND SCIENCE 271 | 
ness, which are to the normal self what noxious germs 
are to their host. And James in his doctrine of the 
specious moment—that snapshot glimpse of the stream 
of consciousness—has shown with what baffling speed 
the mind, so to speak, always keeps ahead of itself. 
There is much food for thought in this controversy 
regarding the self as aberrant and evanescent, over 
against the self as indubitable and immediate. If the dis- 
tinctions are too sharply drawn the issue becomes a 
false one. There may be multiple states of conscious- 
ness, yet out of these we may pick a single state and 
call it the principle of self-identity, and even grant that 
it is unique. Just as for practical purposes many politi- 
cal states may constitute a federal union, so that pecu- 
liar state called self-recognition, may be the bond of 
psychological union. This does not preclude the times 
and seasons in normal life when one is not ‘‘ sure ’’ of 
one’s self, nor the abnormal cases of almost complete 
self-abnegation or forgetfulness. As there may be 
“* sick ’? moments in a healthy mind, so may there be a 
healthy mind back of the sick moments. That at least 
is the hope upon which the pathologist, as physician 
of souls, carries on his work. He is not bothered with 
figures of speech about streams of consciousness or the 
futile flow of sensations; he asks only for a single sane 
moment of self-recognition upon which to crystallize 
his cure. 
We wish the author had sought to reach reality 
through such a study of unreality. Ladd’s interesting 
studies in hypnotism might profitably have been car- 
ried further to illuminate this problem. We may, how- 
ever, suggest one way of escape out of the maze of 
mentality. Suppose the patient has lost the conscious- 
ness of self, or the sense of personality has temporarily   
     
-P-A-G-E-280
272 MODERN IDEALISM 
disappeared. Suppose, again, that hypnotic suggestion 
is applied to the subconscious or subliminal realm. 
Now, until the submerged self has somehow been made 
to rise to the surface of consciousness, it cannot be 
dogmatically asserted that the true self is lost or non- 
existent. We may hold with the author that there is 
ever in man a rational principle, whether latent or 
patent, but does it follow from this that there is one 
immanent mind in nature? In examining the pathologi- 
cal doubt of self we have, as it were, been fighting for 
our souls, but that is far from a warfare in behalf of the 
world-soul. The individual may wish to remain master 
of this little world of self. But to turn that microcosm 
into a macrocosm, to undertake to run the universe after 
the analogy of the self, is highly presumptuous, if noth- 
ing else. 
The realist, at this point, turns into the idealist. He 
reads in the sky ‘‘ huge cloudy symbols of a high ro- 
mance.’”’ We follow him with difficulty. It is one thing 
to say that we are sure of ourselves because we are di- 
rectly aware of our states of consciousness. It is another 
thing to imagine ourselves identical with even the small- 
est part of that great soul which informs the mighty 
mass. The mystic claims to do it by means of his inner 
light; the wxsthete by his supposition of ‘‘ empathy,’’ of 
a feeling one’s self into an object of art. But we 
confess that these very claims conflict with a true indi- 
viduality. Individuality means that, being myself, I 
am separate from other objects; that I am neither a mere 
spark of the divine fire, nor an imaginary state of mind 
of some graven image. These are some of the difficulties 
that we face as we enter upon Ladd’s philosophy of na- 
ture. It is easy to say that as there is a mind in my 
body, so there is one immanent mind in the body of 
 
-P-A-G-E-281
  
IDEALISM AND SCIENCE 273 
nature,—but it is hard to grasp this ‘‘ sense sublime 
of something far more deeply interfused.”’ 
To obtain this high knowledge three avenues of ap- 
proach are suggested: through the beliefs of the primi- 
tive man; through the beliefs of the scientist; through 
the beliefs of the philosopher. The primitive man be- 
lieves in invisible spiritual agencies,—he has a simple, 
childlike way of attributing souls to certain things. The 
scientist believes in laws as modes of the behavior of 
things,—he treats regular phenomena as if they were 
regular habits. The philosopher believes in a system, 
and a system implies central control and a realization of 
ideal ends. Let us examine these three beliefs. Do the 
savage and the scientist really support the philosopher ? 
At the most the scientist has little use for the savage, 
except as a sort of interesting mental scandal. As 
Fiske puts it: In the primitive hypothesis the forces of 
nature must have been likened to human volition because 
there was nothing else with which to compare them. 
Again the scientist, of the positive type, objects to being 
turned into a savage in having his ‘‘ laws ’’ personified. 
There is human behavior and cosmic behavior, but the 
two are by no means one. 
The idealist is in a fix. Mythology will not help mon- 
ism because it is too animistic. Mechanism will not 
help monism because it refuses to be anthropomorphic,— 
its god is not made in the image of man. What then? 
Let us confine the savage in a mental reservation of igno- 
rance, but keep the scientist and reéxamine his beliefs. 
Is mechanism tenable? Can science ‘‘ purify the causal 
concept of the elements contributed by emotion and 
will’’? No! responds Ladd, or else science reduces 
explanation to a lifeless body of abstractions and empty 
formulas which give no real account of anything. The
-P-A-G-E-282
  274 MODERN IDEALISM 
solution has already been suggested. It is personalism. 
Metaphysics, continues the idealist, interprets mecha- 
nism in terms of personal experience. There are here 
two grounds of reinterpretation. In general, causality 
is no invisible bond which seizes hold upon things from 
without and forces them into a semblance of unity. 
Causal connection, when analyzed, appears not so much 
like the external and merely visible connections of a 
machine, but rather like the felt connections of a con- 
scious self. In particular, the student of nature sees, 
what the ordinary observer cannot see; he sees amcbas, 
and bacteria, and white-blood corpuscles, and ova, and 
cilia, and single cells or groups of cells, in all forms of 
living tissue, behaving in a more or less self-like way. 
Nor can he arrest his suspicions of something immanent 
in the reality which, in some faint measure at least, cor- 
responds to his own conscious life, when he minutely 
observes the behavior of the different beings belonging 
to the world of plants. For, in the first place, at the 
lower limits of the two so-called kingdoms, it is difficult 
or impossible for him to tell to which of the two certain 
species should be assigned. And, second, many of those 
species, about the plant-like nature of which there is 
no doubt, show clearer evidences of a soulful existence 
than do many forms, and these by no means the lowest, of 
animal life. 
Ladd is here approaching firmer ground. It is the 
ground of neo-vitalism. In place of the older mechanism, 
the Cartesian and Newtonian explanation of the world 
as made up of masses and forces, there has arisen the 
new biology. This grants, for example, to the ovum a 
nature rich and wonderful, a capacity not only to make 
itself behave as a being-in-itself, but also to make other 
beings which behave like itself. There is also the new
-P-A-G-E-283
IDEALISM AND SCIENCE 275 
astronomy which holds that all the planets in the solar 
system behave ‘‘ as though they knew ’’ how they ought 
to behave under all the circumstances, and taking into 
account their actual relations to all other things. There 
is finally the new physics which takes the forces of 
gravity as implying between the atoms literal affinities, 
or forces that have preferences, and thereby imports a 
self into mere mechanism. 
There now looms up another parting of the ways. 
Some scientists would go on with the idealists, others 
would not. To many mechanism seems sufficient, and 
any attempt to personalize the phenomena of nature, 
whether organic or inorganic, appears mere poetic li- 
cense. Men of this stripe refuse to accompany the 
idealist on the high a priori road. When he says that 
the measurableness of material things implies mentality, 
that concrete realities obey rational principles, that the 
category of force is the outgrowth of personal experience, 
they raise stout objections. For example, both those neo- 
realists and pragmatists, who are radical empiricists, de- 
mand that the tables be turned. They reason just the 
other way, arguing that mentality is derived from meas- 
urableness; that rational principles grow out of con- 
erete realities; that personal experience is the out- 
growth of the feeling of force in obstructing objects. 
Is there any way in which to reconcile these divergent 
views? We believe there is, for the reason that the two 
schools have been looking at the same object from oppo- 
site sides. That object is nature. The side the empiri- 
cists look at is the outside, the environment. The stone 
wall of hard facts against which I run,—that is what 
gives me the rational principles I call empirical. Con- 
trariwise, the side the idealist takes is the inside; he 
looks at nature from within; he considers himself
-P-A-G-E-284
  276 MODERN IDEALISM 
already over the wall, already in possession of the 
key to the fortress of fact. And we ask again: 
Can these two points of view be in the posses- 
sion of the same person? lLadd’s fellow-idealist Royce 
gives an amusing illustration to show that The achieve- 
ment is possible. He alleges that as selves we have 
the paradoxical power of being both subjects and ob- 
jects: I may be meditating in my study, pe I can run 
out of the house and look in at the window and see myself 
still sitting inside. Or we might cite the case of an 
optical illusion, of a spherical figure ilibH appears 
at one moment convex, at the next concave. To the eye 
that figure goes through alternating changes, yet com- 
mon sense tells us that the figure itself does not change. 
In other words, just as the so-called specious moment of 
introspection may be explained by a shifting of the point 
of view, so may the idealist’s world be looked at from 
two points of view. As an object by itself the world 
may be mechanical; but as known to man all things are 
self-like, since the nature of anything is internal. This 
is Ladd’s solution of the paradox, a solution in close 
agreement with Royce’s two worlds,—the scientific 
world of description, the metaphysical of appreciation. 
But the Yale thinker has perhaps gone a step further. 
To put a line of Emerson in positive form, the World- 
Ground might be held to say not only ‘‘ I am the doubter 
and the doubt,’’ but also ‘‘ I am the knower and the 
known.’’ Thus the absolute whole divides itself into 
two parts, not separate and distinct halves of a total 
sphere, but two aspects of the same totality; on the one 
side a system of things already formed, on the other a 
universal life, a force formative and progressive accord- 
ing to ideas. 
With Ladd we have reached the climax of the later
-P-A-G-E-285
  IDEALISM AND SCIENCE 277 
idealism. ‘Now, idealism has been called the most per- 
sistent form of philosophizing in the course of American 
thought. From Johnson and Edwards to Royce and 
Ladd the current, whether above or below ground, has 
had an unbroken flow. It had its sources in the Platon- 
izing Puritans, gained impetus by the deistic evidences 
of design, was swollen by the spring freshet of German 
romanticism, and yet has ever been kept in bounds by 
the ‘‘ genteel tradition ’’ of theism. But there are signs 
that this stream is fatally diverging, if not drying up. 
Other interests are becoming paramount. Pragmatism, 
the new radical empiricism, abandons the absolute for 
the relative, cares less for cosmic purpose than for in- 
dividual achievement, and owes allegiance not so much 
to the reign of law as to the reign of results. But be- 
fore taking up with the paramount pragmatism let us 
briefly consider certain reasons for its present vogue. 
One cause lies in the contrast between the amateur and 
the professional philosopher. The ordinary thinker is 
content to study the three problems of man, nature, 
God,—as they run along side by side. The metaphysi- 
cian, on the other hand, is a monopolist who seeks to 
make a merger of the parallel lines. Like a railroad 
magnate, to his mind all should be under a single man- 
agement. But this merger may be held by many to be 
logically illegal, a kind of conspiracy in restraint of 
thought. Suppose the Absolute controls each and all, 
where is there room for the liberty of the individual? 
In this case, if liberty be granted, is it not specious,

Does not the same follow in respect to nature as the

are asked of the absolutist on the part of one who desires 
independency. The monist is unable to substantiate an 
Absolute, and the critic exclaims in desperation: Let us 
leave good enough alone. Let us be pluralists, believers 
in the existence of separate beings which follow their 
own particular paths. Instead of an ordered universe 
and an Absolute as ‘‘ a seeing force which runs things,”’ 
let us have before us this rich medley of facts, this 
world of buzzing confusion. Now, such a philosophy

At the first glance and from a superficial view prag- 
matism seems a philosophy typical of the land of the 
dollar. But it is more than that. Besides the material 
factor it brings in the personal. As a doctrine of per- 
sonalism it is aggressive; it emphasizes self-sufficingness 
as against self-surrender; pragmatists are literally poets, 
makers, they contribute to truth, enlarge metaphysi- 
cal reality. This is the doctrine of dynamism which 
lies at the bottom of the movement and explains the con- 
stant recurrence to the temperamental test, the formula 
of feeling.\Pragmatic truth is truth with a thrill to it; 
if we can feel that our theories work, we can have the

most intense of satisfactions,—that of personal asser- 
= . re al 
gressive aes As such it can almost be called 
Americanism. It expresses the national worship of the 
practical inventor, the pushing man of affairs. But here 
the doctrine broadens into wider aspects. Besides the 
confidence in the application of science to the conquering 
of nature, the winning of the West by Yankee inventions, 
there is the ideal of democracy as a reénforcing factor. 
As we have a share in the making of our government, so 
we have a share in the making of truth, and, provided 
the principle of representation be given proper scope, 
there arises the irresistible might of united personalities, 
all having their say. And besides this sublimated nation- 
alism there is a still wider horizon. Pragmatism becomes 
humanism. In his collective capacity man now finds 
that his fate is not wholly made for him either by 
mechanical forces or by supreme powers. In the high 
confidence that the strong will win, that nothing is 
impossible to the powerful, he comes to the conclusion 
not that he must adapt himself to environment, but that 
environment must adapt itself to him. In a word, find- 
ing the world so plastic, he comes to believe himself no 
longer man, but super-man. 
As personal, dynamic, human and superhuman, prag- 
matism has well-nigh broken bounds, Let us, therefore, 
turn back and trace its rise in the land of its birth. 
Hailed as a typical American philosophy, pragmatism 
has had three phases in its native growth,—the primitive 
of Charles Peirce, the developed of John Dewey, and 
the radical of William James. “In this triumvirate of 
pragmatism Peirce taught that it was logical,—a method. 
to make our ideas clear; Dewey taught that it 
     
-P-A-G-E-289
THE PHILOSOPHY OF PRACTICALITY 281 
instrumental,—a_ useful tool for action; James taught 
that it was temperamental, —a,_way .to..reach..personal 
satisfaction. Finally, these three varieties of prag- 
matism had different applications. The first tended to 
be solipsistic, to confine itself to the individual and his 
doubts; the second to be social, to pass.over the bar- 
riers of self; the third to be transcendental, to leap 
beyond human barriers, to reach a pluralistic universe 
of higher powers, earth-angels, world-souls, with which 
man may have intercourse. In order of time pragmatism 
is primitive, or developed, or radical. In its point of 
view it is logical, or instrumental, or temperamental. 
In its application it is solipsistic, or social, or tran- 
scendental. Of these three varieties let us now take up 
_the-fitst. 
Primitive pragmatism was started in 1878 by Charles 
Peirce as a logical method teaching us how to make 
our ideas clear. Taking, for example, the rival theories 
of fatalism and_free-will, he gave this as a maxim to 
clear up metaphysics: ‘*Consider what effects, that 
might-eenceivably have practical bee bearings, we conceive 
the object of our conceptions to “have. Then, our con- 
ception of these effects is the whole of the conception of 
the object.’’ Such is the mild doctrine which sought 
to induce reasonableness, as shown in becoming governed 
by laws, becoming instinct with general ideas. This 
doctrine lay neglected for twenty years, when it was 
revived by William James in his notable California Ad- 
dress of 1898. In this James added a personal note in 
remarking: ‘‘ I should préefer-toexpress Peirce’s prin- 
‘Ss ing that. the’ effective. meaning: of-any philo-        
ee consequence in our-future practical experi- 
ence,”’
-P-A-G-E-290
  282 PRAGMATISM 
The pragmatic seed planted by Peirce L. -watered-by~ 
James grew rapidly in a congenial-soil. The result was. 
the ‘Chicago school, whereby Dewey and_his followers 
carried the doctrine into the wide fields of biological and 
social adaptation. \' The primitive formula was discovered. 
to be a fundamental law of growth, the. vital.-principle

preted as having practical bearings, was-now enlarged _ 
into @ law of ‘Bocial success. The principle of Peirce in 
the thirty y ty years_of its growth had-gotten-out.of hand. 
Such growth was not without reason. Transplanted

prefers to test-his ; skill-and-his-strength- as occasion may 
arise. It is this spirit-of the unexpected that gives point 
to the pragmatic formula. An idea, a thing may or may 
not succeed. It may be true, or it may be false. T may 
be able to carry my canoe to the next water, or the 
cataract may upset me. My plan-of-going-out-+this-way

lished-harmony. 
Such a defense is all very well, replies the anti- 
pragmatic critic, but is the novice apt to succeed? Is 
there not wooderaft and forest lore to be learned from 
the guides? Can the pragmatist be a solipsist, a lone 
traveler in the wilderness? Does he not need the knowl- 
edge of others? . . . Questions like these led from primi- 
tive to developed pragmatism, from the solipsistie to the 
social stage. Peirce talked like a pioneer, some Daniel 
Boone of metaphysics. But Dewey, and James after him, 
acknowledged that the successful thinker cannot exist 
alone and unaided in his speculations. There is a treas- 
ure of past experience,—the accumulated wisdom of his 
ancestors. Such are the axioms which are accepted as 
true because they have been ever found to work. Our 
primitive predecessors did the first exploring in the un- 
mapped maze of knowledge; they found that certain 
human ways of thinking succeeded, and nature, preserva- 
tive of all successful achievements, handed these down as    
 
-P-A-G-E-292
  284 PRAGMATISM 
habits of action. These are not dogmatic first prin- 
ciples, clear-cut innate ideas, but general tendencies, 
natural promptings, instinctive leadings. Here the 
hereditary transmissive factor of human knowledge ap- 
pears. The solipsistic empiricist has developed into the 
social inheritor of funded knowledge. 
It is because of this sinking fund of the past that 
Dewey, the evolutionist, gives a real cash value to in- 
strumental truths. They pass current, not merely be- 
cause of their face value, but because of their intrinsic 
worth. The primitive pragmatist, like the early pioneer, 
issued wild-cat currency; but with the developed prag- 
matist a mere personal promissory note was not enough. 
The collateral of continuity was demanded and this was 
supplied by the evolutionist with his doctrine of inherited 
tendencies. In a word the Bank of Truth was founded 
long ago. 
2. Primitive PRAGMATISM: CHARLES PEIRCE 
In the very first of his essays called ‘‘ Illustrations of 
the Logie of Science,’’ Peirce makes a statement which 
contains implicitly the three phases in the history of prag- 
matism,—the logical, the instrumental, the temperamen- 
tal. Discussing the logic of science he says: Logicality 
in regard to practical matters is the most useful quality 
an animal can possess. . . . It is certainly best for us 
that our beliefs should be such as may truly guide our 
actions so as to satisfy our desires. 
While this statement might have a threefold meaning, 
might furnish grounds for all the later developments 
of the movement, such is not its intent. The method of 
science, continues Peirce, should be strictly logical, other- 
wise we run off into false methods. The first of these  
-P-A-G-E-293
PRIMITIVE PRAGMATISM: CHARLES PEIRCE 285 
is the a priori method, to think as one is inclined to 
think. The second is the method of tenacity where, as 
soon as a firm belief is reached, we are entirely satisfied, 
whether the belief be true or false. The third is the 
method of authority where one does not think as one 
is inclined, but because the state or some institution so 
wills. 
But there is a method above all these,—it is that of 
science. -It is not the method of the individual for the 
sake of comfortable conclusions. It is not the method 
of tenacity held to by society. It is not the method of 
authority, governing the mass of mankind and leading 
to the path of peace. No, there is a method above all 
these—above the individual, or society, or mankind it- 
self. It is the method of science and its aim is the 
growth of reasonableness, shown in becoming governed 
by laws, becoming instinct with general ideas. . . . The 
test of whether I am truly following the method is not 
an immediate appeal to my feelings and purposes, but, 
on the contrary, itself involves the application of 
that method, which is to have a clear logical con- 
science. 
How is the latter obtained? The answer is given in 
the second and best known of Peirce’s papers, entitled 
‘* How to Make our Ideas Clear.’’ Before we attain to 
the cardinal pragmatic principle, already quoted, there 
are certain preliminary steps. The first of these is to 
emerge from conceptions that are obscure to those that 
are clear, by means of belief. And what, then, is belief? 
It is something that appeases the irritation of doubt and 
involves the establishment in our nature of the rule of 
action, or habit. Now, since the essence of a belief is 
the establishment of a habit, different beliefs are dis- 
tinguished by the different modes of action to which they
-P-A-G-E-294
  
286 PRAGMATISM 
give rise. For example, the question of free-will and 
fate in its simplest form is this: I have done something 
of which I am ashamed; could I, by an effort of the 
will, have resisted the temptation and done otherwise? 
The answer is that, if I had willed to do otherwise than 
I did, I should have done otherwise, and that contradic- 
tory results would follow from a contrary hypothesis. 
Thus we come to the clearing up of our ideas by saying 
that our idea of anything is our idea of its sensible 
effect, and thus, finally, we reach the rule for attaining 
the final grade of clearness and apprehension, namely, 
“* Consider what effects, that might conceivably have 
practical bearing, we conceive the object of our con- 
ception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is 
the whole of our conception of the object.’’ 
Again we have the famous principle of Peirce around 
which so much controversy has raged. It is rightly in- 
terpreted to mean a maxim for clearing up metaphysics. 
It is wrongly interpreted to mean a mere rule of action. 
Against this misinterpretation of the principle its origi- 
nator protested. He held that the principle had been 
carried too far when it was changed from one of 
methodology to one of practicality. In criticism of 
James, who asserted that beliefs are nothing but rules 
of action, Peirce contended that such doctrine assumes 
that the end of man is action. He added that this stoical 
axiom did not recommend itself so forcibly to him at 
the age of sixty as it did at thirty. If it be admitted, 
on the contrary, that action wants an end, and that that 
end must be something of a general description, then 
the spirit of the maxim itself, which is that we must look 
to the upshot of our concept in order rightly to appre- 
hend them, would direct us towards something different 
from practical facts, namely, to general ideas, as the 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
    PRIMITIVE PRAGMATISM: CHARLES PEIRCE 287 
true interpreters of our thought. . . . This maxim leads 
to clearness of thought, furthers the development of con- 
erete reasonableness so that the meaning of a concept 
does not lie in any individual reactions at all, but in the 
manner in which those reactions contribute to that de- 
velopment. 
Few interpreters of primitive pragmatism have gone 
back to these sources and shown the real doctrine of 
Peirce. It was more general than is ordinarily thought, 
and also far less selfish. The doctrine is one called by 
its author pragmaticism. It is more than immediate 
empiricism; it is a game of consequences and those con- 
sequences the most remote. In a word, the pragmatist is 
willing to take risks in order to attain truth. All this 
is brought out in the third of Peirce’s essays, ‘‘ The 
Doctrine of Chances.’’ In this it is held that a man con- 
not be logical so long as he is concerned only with his 
own fate, for the chances are against him in a short 
series of probabilities. Therefore, only that man who 
should care equally for what was to happen in all pos- 
sible cases could act logically,—sure succcess comes only 
in the long run. It may seem strange, concludes Peirce, 
that I should put forward three sentiments, namely, 
interest in an indefinite community, recognition of the 
possibility of this interest being made supreme, and 
hope in the unlimited continuance of intellectual activity, 
as indispensable requirements of logic. Yet, when we 
consider that logic depends on a mere struggle to escape 
doubt, which, as it terminates in action, must begin 
in emotion, and that, furthermore, the only cause of 
our planting ourselves on reason is that other methods 
of escaping doubt fail on account of the social impulse, 
why should we wonder to find social sentiment presup- 
posed in reasoning? 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
ee ee ee ee ee Pe Pee pee eee 
288 PRAGMATISM 
Such is primitive pragmatism, quite different from 
what has been generally thought. Its aim is less selfish 
than social, its spirit less practical than general. For 
this interpretation we have the word of Peirce when he 
further insists that his maxim is a clarifying maxim; 
and that even reasonableness is not a good in itself but 
only an aid in the evolutionary process. But the primi- 
tive principle, as the author complains, has become 
“* transmogrified.’’? Reality, according to present prag- 
matism, is to be tested by immediacy ; truth to be found 
in the exigencies of practical life. The search, then, is 
for what is needed and useful. In a word the test of 
truth is success. 
For this interpretation James and Dewey are jointly 
responsible. The former enlarges his modification of 
Peirce’s principle when he says: In methodology it is 
certain that to trace and compare their respective con- 
sequences is an admirable way of establishing the differ- 
ing meanings of different conceptions. . . . The mean- 
ing of a conception expresses itself in practical con- 
sequences, either in the shape of conduct to be 
recommended, or in that of experience to be expected. 
In like manner Dewey enlarges the primitive principle. 
At first his problem is how to make our ideas clear to 
ourselves and how to get out of them their cash value; 
at the last he socializes the problem and turns from 
commercialism to humanism. So we have next to show 
how this broadening of the initial principle was left to 
the Chicago school, and how that fine air of adventure 
was applied to social ethics,—to the search for practical 
principles destined to bring the greatest good to the 
greatest number.

THE CHICAGO SCHOOL: JOHN DEWEY = 289 
8. THe Cuicaco ScHoot: Joun DEWEY 
In the beginning of his first essay on ‘‘ Thought and its 
Subject-Matter ’? Dewey follows in the footsteps of 
Peirce. The latter had advocated that sort of logic 
which would appease the irritation of doubt and clear 
up our ideas. So Dewey holds that reflective thought 
has as the measure of its success the degree in which 
the thinking disposes of the difficulty. This is applied 
logic. Against it the advocates of pure logic bring the 
charge that it deals merely with hindrances, and with 
the devices for overcoming them. Now, the absolutists 
disparage such considerations of utility, because they 
prefer ‘‘ universal forms and principles of thought which 
hold good everywhere irrespective of any difference 
in the objects.’’ By such disparagement the reader will 
readily see the absolutists cut out the entire procedure 
of practical deliberation and of concrete scientific re- 
search. And in their preference for abstractions, with- 
out possible reference or bearing, they expose the weak- 
ness of mere metaphysics in the sense of a metaphysics 
which makes a gulf between itself and science. The 
pragmatic method is different. What we have to reckon 
with is not the problem of, How can I think at large? 
but, How shall I think right here and now? The various 
modes of conceding, judging, and inferring are to be 
treated, not as qualifications of thought at large, but of 
thought engaged in its specific, most economic, effective 
response to its own particular occasion. 
We have here reached the instrumental type of think- 
ing. It has two advantages. Negatively, it wipes out 
the distinction between thought and fact, the hypothet- 
ical chasm between pure and applied logic which a false 
metaphysics created. Positively, it falls in line with the
-P-A-G-E-298
  290 PRAGMATISM 
evolutionary process, wherein biology and social history 
disclose the fact that every distinct organ, structure, or 
formation, every grouping of cells or elements, has to be 
treated as an instrument of adaptation to a particular 
environing situation. 
Dewey thus boldly lays down the platform of instru- 
mentalism. In pointing out its negative and positive 
sides we may suggest that it is finally to be judged by 
the rule of Leibniz, that philosophers are not so much 
true in what they deny, as in what they affirm. This 
explains why the absolutists have been up in arms 
against Dewey’s denials. They do not relish his bald 
dilemma, namely, that we have no choice, save either 
to conceive of thinking as a response to a specific 
stimulus, or else to regard it as something ‘‘ in it- 
self.’’? But are we left to this bare dilemma be- 
tween Czsar or nobody? When Dewey protests 
against the diremption between thought and things, he 
is protesting against a false transcendentalism which 
would put a line of cleavage between the world of fancy 
and the world of fact. His own solution actually ap- 
proaches a true transcendentalism, being a species of 
immanence, a marrying of thought to things. Thus he 
explains: As we submit each characteristic situation of 
experience to our gaze we find it has a dual aspect. In 
the course of changing experience we keep our balance, 
because, wherever there is thinking, there is material in 
question. Now the old-style logician sets the agent over 
against the externality of the fact, but the new does not 
keep ‘‘ thought in itself ’’ apart from the limits of the 
special work it has to do. This leads to the value of 
the logic of experience. Philosophy, defined as such a 
logic, makes no pretense to be an account of a closed and 
finished universe; its business is not to secure or guar-
-P-A-G-E-299
  THE CHICAGO SCHOOL: JOHN DEWEY — 291 
antee any particular reality or value. On the contrary, 
it gets the significance of a method. The right relation- 
ship, the adjustment of the various typical phases of 
experience to one another, is a problem felt in every de- 
partment of life. Intellectual control of these adjust- 
ments cannot fail to reflect itself in an added clearness 
and security on the practical side. . . . The value of 
research for social progress; the bearing of psychology 
upon educational procedure; the mutual relations of 
fine and industrial art; the question of the extent and 
nature of specialization in science in comparison with 
the claims of applied science; the adjustment of religious 
aspirations to scientific statements—such are a few of 
the many social questions whose final answer depends 
upon the possession and use of a general logic of experi- 
ence as a method of inquiry and of interpretation. 
Of all these suggested reforms Dewey has carried out 
most successfully a combination of the first two, namely, 
social progress and educational procedure. Through his 
work in connection with the Laboratory School, exist- 
ing in Chicago between 1896 and 1903, his ideas attained 
such concreteness as comes from embodiment and testing 
in practice. The problem is considered to be one of 
instrumental logic, the application of thought to things. 
The usual school has been so set apart, he explains, so 
isolated from the ordinary conditions and motives of 
life, that the place where children are sent for discipline 
is the one place in the world where it is most difficult 
to get such experience. Contrast with this the old days 
when the household was practically the center in which 
were carried on all the typical forms of industrial occu- 
pation. The clothing worn was not only made in the 
house, but the members of the household were generally 
familiar with the shearing of the sheep, the carding and 
 
-P-A-G-E-300
Pe rn Te ee EME ee ee oe eT eee Ce eR ec eee 
292 PRAGMATISM | 
spinning of the wool, and the plying of the loom. In 
short, the entire industrial process stood revealed, from 
the production on the farm of the raw materials, till 
the finished article was actually put into use. Not only 
this, but practically every member of the household had 
his own share in the work. The children, as they gained 
in strength and capacity, were gradually initiated into 
the mysteries of the several processes. It was a matter 
of immediate and personal concern even to the point 
of actual participation. Such was the old household 
system which furnished an intimate acquaintance with 
nature at first hand, with real things and materials, with 
the actual processes of their manipulation, and the 
knowledge of their social necessities and uses. 
In contrast with this, consider the school of the pres- 
ent day, which appeals for the most part simply to the 
intellectual aspect of our natures, our desire to learn, to 
accumulate information, and to get control of the sym- 
bols of learning; not to our impulses and tendencies to 
make, to do, to create, to produce, whether in the form 
of utility or of art. Against this conventional mod- 
ern conception, which is merely a survival of a false 
medievalism, the age revolts. One of the most striking 
tendencies at present is toward the introduction of so- 
called manual ‘‘ training,’’ shop-work, and the house- 
hold arts—sewing and cooking. This has not been done 
“on purpose,’’ with a full consciousness that the school 
must now supply that factor of training formerly taken 
care of in the home, but rather by instinct, by experi- 
menting and finding that such work takes a vital hold 
of pupils and gives them something which was not to 
be got in any other way. Consciousness of its real im- 
port is still so weak that the work is often done in a 
half-hearted, confused, and unrelated way. The rea- 
 
-P-A-G-E-301
  
THE CHICAGO SCHOOL: JOHN DEWEY 293 
sons assigned to justify it are painfully inadequate or 
sometimes even positively wrong. 
Can we give actual reasons for what roughly may 
be termed the ‘‘ new ’’ education? It is useless to be- 
moan the departure of the good old days of children’s 
modesty, reverence, and implicit obedience, if we expect 
merely by bemoaning and by exhortation to bring them 
back. It is radical conditions which have changed, and 
only an equally radical change in education suffices. In 
the century of changes between the household and 
factory systems one can hardly believe there has been a 
revolution in all history so rapid, so extensive, so com- 
plete. Through it the face of the earth is making over, 
even as to its physical forms; political boundaries are 
wiped out and moved about, as if they were indeed only 
lines on a paper map; population is hurriedly gathered 
into cities from the ends of the earth; habits of living 
are altered with startling abruptness and thoroughness; 
the search for the truths of nature is infinitely stimu- 
lated and facilitated and their application to life made 
not only practicable, but commercially necessary. 
Such conditions, continues Dewey, mean much to the 
city-bred child of to-day. For example, the new geog- 
raphy is not merely the study of metes and bounds, 
but the earth as the great field, the great mine, the great 
source of the energies of heat, light, and electricity ; the 
great scene of ocean, stream, mountain, and plain, of 
which all our agricultural and mining and lumbering, 
all our manufacturing and distributing agencies, too, 
are but the partial elements and factors. So, too, the new 
manual training is not merely utilitarian like sewing on 
buttons or making patches. Looked at from the proper 
genetic point of view, we find that this work gives the 
point of departure from which the child can begin to  
-P-A-G-E-302
  294 PRAGMATISM 
follow the progress of mankind in history, getting an 
insight also into the materials he is using and the 
mechanical principles involved. In connection with 
these occupations, the historic development of man is 
recapitulated. For example, the children are first given 
the raw material—the flax, the cotton plant, the wool 
as it comes from the back of the sheep. . . . Then a 
study is made of these materials from the standpoint 
of their adaptation to the uses to which they may be 
put. For instance, a comparison of the cotton fiber 
with wool fiber is made. I did not know until the chil- 
dren told me, that the reason for the late development 
of the cotton industry as compared with the woolen is, 
that the cotton fiber is so very difficult to free by hand 
from the seeds. The children in one group worked thirty 
minutes freeing cotton fibers from the boll and the seeds 
and succeeded in getting out less than one ounce. They 
could easily believe that one person could only gin one 
pound a day by hand, and could understand why their 
ancestors wore woolen instead of cotton clothing... . 
They then followed the processes necessary for working 
the fibers up into cloth. They re-invented the first frame 
for carding the wool—a couple of boards with sharp 
pins in them for scratching it out. They redevised the 
simplest process for spinning the wool—a pierced stone 
or some other weight through which the wool is passed, 
and which as it is twirled draws out the fiber, next the 
top, which was spun on the floor, while the children 
kept the wool in their hands until it was gradually drawn 
out and wound upon it. Then the children are intro- 
duced to the invention next in historic order, working 
it out experimentally, thus seeing its necessity, and 
tracing its effects, not only upon that particular indus- 
try, but upon modes of social life—in this way passing

in review the entire process up to the present complete 
loom, and all that goes with the application of science in 
the use of our present available powers. I need not 
speak of the science involved in this—the study of the 
fibers, of geographical features, the conditions under 
which raw materials are grown, the great centers of 
manufacture and distribution, the physics involved in 
the machinery of production; nor, again, of the his- 
torical side—the influence which these inventions have 
had upon humanity. . . . Now, what is true of this one 
instance of fibers used in fabrics, is true in its measure 
of every material used in every occupation, and of the 
processes employed. The occupation supplies the child 
with a genuine motive; it gives him experience at first 
hand; it brings him into contact with realities. It does 
all this, but in addition it is liberalized throughout by 
translation into its historic values and scientific equiva- 
lences. It ceases with the growth of the child’s mind 
in power and knowledge to be a pleasant occupation 
merely, and becomes more and more a medium, an in- 
strument, an organ—and is thereby transformed. 
From the accomplishments of Dewey’s Laboratory 
School we may deduce the platform of the Chicago 
group. Like a literal platform it may be looked at 
from four sides. First, it is genetic: it does not recog- 
nize ‘‘ an object of thought in itself,’’ but only a series 
of values, which vary with the varying functions to 
which they belong. Next, it is instrumental: it looks 
upon the notion of thought as an“immanent tool, as a 
scaffolding which is an integral part to the very opera- 
tion of building. Again, it is social: it seeks for a 
clear and comprehensive consensus of public conviction, 
and a consequent concentrated and economical direction 
of effort. Finally, it is empirical: there is no pure
-P-A-G-E-304
  296 PRAGMATISM 
thought as such, nothing real which is not a direct matter 
of experience. 
Let us see what these four points are worth. As usual 
the positive are strongest. First, as genetic, pragmatism 
allies itself with evolutionism and has behind it all the 
force of that movement; its cardinal doctrine is adapta- 
tion to environment, for knowing is a function in the 
process of adjustment. Next, as instrumental, it allies 
itself with the new methods of science, it adapts tool 
to material, reconstructs conflicting experiences. The 
thinker, like the carpenter, is at once stimulated and 
checked in every stage of his procedure by the particular 
situation which confronts him; materials, price of labor, 
credit at the bank—all are varying factors demanding 
constant readjustment. This instrumental adaptability 
seems the stronger of the positive points. As scientific 
it passes over from the pure to the applied, by showing 
the relation of the two. As James interprets it: In 
instrumentalism a fact and a theory have not different 
natures, as is usually supposed, the one being objective, 
the other subjective; they are both made of the same 
material, experience-material namely, and their differ- 
ence relates to their way of functioning solely; it is 
“« fact’? when it functions steadily; it is ‘‘ theory ”’ 
when we hesitate. 
Again, as social, pragmatism allies itself with the 
broader movement known as humanism: The individual 
and immediate are marks of ordinary human endeavor; 
whereas the general and remote are marks of abstract 
speculators dwelling apart from the mass of mankind. 
. . These statements are rather vague and indefinite ; 
so is the social programme of the pragmatist. Indeed 
Dewey has overloaded his platform and has practically 
earried out only the first of his proposals,—the applica-
-P-A-G-E-305
  
THE CHICAGO SCHOOL: JOHN DEWEY ~— 297 
tion of genetic psychology to educational procedure. 
But if this side of the platform remains unfinished, the 
last does not. As immediately empirical, pragmatism 
puts a strong barrier against absolutism. Upon this 
barrier Dewey has lavished his greatest labor: Prag- 
matism, empiricism, humanism, functionalism, call it 
what you will, needs no unknowable, no absolute, behind 
it or around the finite world; no absolute, either, in the 
sense of anything eternally constant, for no term is 
static, but everything in process and change. In like 
spirit Dewey has carried out the controversy in his more 
recent essays. The reason, he explains, that pragmatism 
has no use for a perfect, absolute, complete, finished 
thought is that the facts of life are crude, raw, unor- 
ganized, brute. 
We take this to be the crux of the matter. Truth does 
not consist in conformity or correspondence with an 
externally fixed archetype or model, but is in process of 
formation like all other things. In a word, ‘‘ Truth ’’ 
is not something in the heavens, apart from man, mys- 
terious and incomprehensible save to the inspired; 
but rather an empirical reality given to every man. 
Such, at least, seems to be the import of the cryptic 
saying, ‘‘ Anything, everything, are what they are ex- 
perienced as.’’ This is the postulate of mere empiricism 
as expanded in the first of the essays after the Chicago 
studies. The empiricist, continues the author, when he 
talks of experience does not mean some grandiose, re- 
mote affair that is cast like a net around a succession of 
fleeting experiences; he does not mean an indefinite, 
total, comprehensive experience which somehow engir- 
dles an endless flux; he means that things are what they 
are experienced to be, and that every experience is some 
thing. . . . From this postulate of empiricism, as a  
-P-A-G-E-306
      
  298 PRAGMATIS. 
  general concept, nothing can be deduced, not a single 
philosophic proposition. But the real significance of 
the principle is that of a method of philosophical an- 
alysis—a method identical in kind (but differing in 
problem and hence in operation) with that of the scien- 
tists. If you wish to find out what subjective, objective, 
physical, mental, cosmic, psychic—any philosophic term, 
in short—means, go to experience and see what the thing 
is experienced as. Such a method is not spectacular; 
it permits of no offhand demonstrations of God, free- 
dom, immortality, nor of the exclusive reality of mat- 
ter, or ideas, or consciousness. But it supplies a way 
of telling what all these terms mean. It may seem in- 
significant, or chillingly disappointing, but only to one 
who will not try it. Philosophie concepts have outlived 
their usefulness considered as stimulants to emotion, or 
as a species of sanctions; and a larger, more fruitful, and 
more valuable career awaits them considered as specific- 
ally experienced meanings. 
We notice at this juncture how Dewey has outdone 
Peirce; how the principle of cool reasonableness has 
developed into the cultivation of cold reason. But in 
adding that all existence is direct and vital, we may 
ask if the author has not carried the matter to extremes. 
Philosophie principles, especially the great triad of God, 
freedom, and immortality, are wont to be experienced as 
emotional and thus we find them interpreted by William 
James. It is the mystic strain in the temperamental 
pragmatist of Cambridge that makes him follow the old 
saying that the heart has reasons that the reason knows 
not of. It would be a more generous view of life to 
utilize the sanctions of sentiment. But for such sane- 
tions the Chicago pragmatist has little use. He is an 
iconoclast of beliefs that transcend his method. The
-P-A-G-E-307
  THE CHICAGO SCHOOL: JOHN DEWEY = 299 
contrast is clear. James is the promoter of the will to 
believe, Dewey of the reason to believe. He holds that 
knowledge as science is the outcome of systematically 
directed inquiry, not submissive acceptance of ‘‘ reality ’’ 
as ready-made, fixed, and of finished form. 
This was the position taken in 1905 when the war was 
carried into the enemy’s country. In Emerson Hall it- 
self, in the very building dedicated to the chief of our 
absolutists, Dewey, as President of the American Philo- 
sophical Association, delivered his Cambridge address 
on ‘‘ Beliefs and Existences.’’ In general the address 
was an attack on conventionalism, and an assertion of 
personalism. There was about it a Western air of inde- 
pendence and the whole was bathed in the atmosphere 
of the adventurous. The modern age, it explained, is 
marked by a refusal to be satisfied with the postpone- 
ment of the exercise and function of reason to another 
and supernatural sphere, and by a resolve to practice 
itself upon its present object, nature, with all its joys. 
Instead of taking an oath of allegiance to Reality, ob- 
jective, universal, complete, it prefers home rule, the 
gallantry of adventure, the genuineness of the incom- 
plete. Instead of the prevalent academic philosophy of 
passionless imperturbability, absolute detachment, it 
prefers need, uncertainty, choice, novelty, strife. Now 
beliefs are personal affairs and personal affairs are ad- 
ventures ; for the world has meaning as somebody’s, some- 
body’s at a juncture taken for better or worse, and you 
shall not have completed your metaphysics till you have 
told whose world is meant and how and what for—in 
what bias and to what effect. 
It is strange how this call to independency, this chal- 
lenge to originality resembles the first address of Emer- 
son, in this very spot, a generation before. ‘‘ Why 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
ee TT ar ee ee eT ne mee ep SEE et ee eee rae a 
300 PRAGMATISM 
should not we also enjoy an original relation to the 
universe? ’’ asks the transcendentalist. ‘‘ Why should 
not we have a philosophy of insight and not of tradition ? 
[oe Why should we grope among the dry bones of the past 
when nature’s floods of life stream around and through 
us?’’ Here is one of those curious points of resem- 
| blance at the beginnings of important movements of 
| thought. Emerson was addressing the younger genera- 
tion, protesting against the dominance of the dogmatic 
realism of the Scotch school with its short cut of common 
sense. And so, in turn, the pragmatist protests against 
the continuance of that ancient tradition which lasted on 
like the Greek influence upon our local architecture. 
Thus is the classic spirit again met with the romantic, 
the conventions and unities with unconventional 
pluralism; universals, axioms, and a priori truths 
with the trials and errors of struggling human 
beings. 
While the old conflict is repeated, the effective forces 
are new. Modern biology, psychology, and the social 
sciences, continues Dewey, proffer an imposing body of 
conerete facts that point to the interpretation of knowl- 
edge as a human and practical outgrowth of personal 
belief. The testimony of biology is that the organic 
instrument of the whole intellectual life, the sense or- 
gans and brain and their connections, have been de- 
veloped on a definitely practical basis and for practical 
aims, for the purpose of such control over conditions 
as will sustain and vary the meanings of life. The testi- 
mony of psychology is that sensation and perception, 
have a motor, not a static meaning. The testimony of 
the historic sciences is that knowledge as a system of 
information and instruction is a codperative social 
achievement, and that logical thinking is a reweaving
-P-A-G-E-309
THE CHICAGO SCHOOL: JOHN DEWEY — 301 
through individual activity of the social fabric at such 
points as are indicated by prevailing need and aims. 
In this, his Presidential Address, Dewey gives us the 
clearest statement of his creed; at the same time he 
leaves us with an unanswered problem which James 
previously designated as the gap in the Chicago system. 
There is no cosmology. Granted that logical thinking 
is a reweaving through individual activity of the social 
fabric, can the same be said of the cosmic fabric? In 
social advancement, such as the making of a state con- 
stitution or the improving of a city, we may acknowledge 
that the web is woven as we go. But does this hold good 
of the ampler life, especially of that shining appari- 
tion we call nature? If thought, as Dewey elsewhere 
says, is a reorganizing power because it is a vital func- 
tion,—of what, we may ask, is it a function? We may 
dismiss the account of the static absolutist that there is 
some eternal pattern after which the daily pattern is 
woven. But does this mean that the only process is one 
of a stitch at a time, and that the resulting fabric has 
often to be unraveled because faulty and imperfect? 
At times the pragmatist seems content with such a nar- 
row empiricism. He appeals to ‘‘ plain, ordinary, every- 
day empirical reflections, operating as centers of inquiry, 
of suggestion, of experimentation.’’ At other times he 
seems inclined towards the wider sweep of rationalism; 
not the wholly at large view of the absolutist, but ‘‘ regu- 
lation ’’ in an ‘‘ auspicious ”’ direction, tested ideas 
which perform a ‘‘ recurrent ’’ function. These admis- 
sions appear to furnish what James calls the real safe- 
guard against the caprice of statement and indetermina- . 
tion of belief, that ‘‘ grain ’’ in things against which we 
cannot practically go. It is doubtful if Dewey acknowl- 
edges this grain, for in a further essay on ‘‘ Experience
-P-A-G-E-310
  
302 PRAGMATISM 
and Objective Idealism ’’ he distinctly favors subjective 
experience. Of human arrangements and institutional- 
izations he claims that their value is experimental, not 
fixedly ontological; law and order are good things, but 
not when they become rigidity and create mechanical 
uniformity or routine. 
In these passages there is raised the old controversy be- 
tween the doctrines of being and becoming, of fate and 
free-will, of fixity and chance. The controversy is diffi- 
cult, yet in its discussion it is clear that there are two 
positions which Dewey does not take. He is opposed to 
the Humean skepticism which regards experience as a 
chance association, by merely psychic connections, of in- 
dividualistic states of consciousness. He is also opposed 
to that objective idealism which gives the semblance of 
order, system, connection, mutual reference, to sensory 
data that without its assistance are mere subjective 
flux. He stands, then, between two extremes,—solip- 
sism, or that form of individualism which makes one 
man’s meat another man’s poison; and absolutism, which 
cramps humanity into the procrustean bed of precon- 
ceived ideas. No, Dewey leaves humanity to make its 
own bed, and if it is uncomfortable, to make it over 
again. 
But if life is not a mere kaleidoscope of shifting 
events, how far can we count on any teleological ele- 
ment, any plan or purpose in it? To this question Dewey 
gives a twofold answer. As to immediate empiricism 
he asserts that it is not solipsistic, because that would 
put all error in the individual consciousness; nor is it 
absolutistic, because that would put all truth in the su- 
preme consciousness; but it is humanistic because it 
puts both error and truth in human knowledge. This 
answer is safe and sane, but is it satisfactory? Not to
-P-A-G-E-311
THE CHICAGO SCHOOL: JOHN DEWEY 303 
the metaphysician who would go beyond human con- 
sciousness for a deeper answer to the problem. Prag- 
matism claims to be naturalistic. So it is, provided the 
word nature be confined to human nature. But what 
of that immensely wider environment in which man is 
set? Is there a ‘‘ grain ’’ in things against which we 
cannot go, a ‘‘ system ’’ in the cosmic game of chance 
against which we cannot win? Of the two main mean- 
ings of chance Dewey avoids the one, but does not grap- 
ple with the other. There is the popular sense in which 
chance means a capricious and incomprehensible con- 
tingency. There is another sense; namely, that of a hid- 
den but discoverable thread of connection. To the 
Greek it is the thread which the Fates spin; to the 
gambler it is the ‘‘ system ’’ by which he tries to break 
the bank; to the scientist it is the mathematical, pre- 
dictable element in the fiux of events, that function 
which appears as a constant, provided the series be suffi- 
ciently prolonged. Blind chance, the scientist hates it ; 
like Galileo he exclaims: ‘‘ Vanish, ye dark vaults of 
heaven! ”’ 
Even here there is a distressing dilemma. Shall we 
say that there is a plan, but it passes man’s understand- 
ing; or that there is no plan, but the nature of things is 
a purposeless flux? As to the former view the prag- 
matist demurs. Like a good Yankee he ‘‘ wants to 
know.”’ As to the latter view there is some uncer- 
tainty. Primitive pragmatism has been interpreted by 
Bakewell and others as a latter-day flowing philosophy, 
a revival of the ancient doctrine of Heracleitus, that man 
cannot dip into the same river twice. Such interpreters 
also give us the choice between Protagoras and Plato; 
between man as the measure of all things, and man 
as the interpreter of nature in the sense of read- 
 
-P-A-G-E-312
  304 PRAGMATISM 
ing its secrets. Of the latter school is Emerson, while 
Royce continues the tale in the World and the Indi- 
vidual. 
What is the broader relation of these two views? We 
fail to see that Dewey has grappled with the problem. 
Given functional empiricism and thought as the vital 
function, what is the immanent principle at work? Is 
it humanistic or cosmic? Is it confined to civic com- 
munities, or can a Greater Chicago school take in the 
cosmos as a suburb? The answer is not yet given. Ina 
strictly up-to-date simile Dewey, as upholder of the voli- 
tional, disparages Absolute Reason. Did purpose ride 
in a cosmic automobile toward a predestined goal, he 
exclaims, it would not cease to be physical and mechani- 
eal because labeled Divine Idea, or Perfect Reason. 
However, we may query whether human reason is the 
immanent motor or whether it is merely the speed indi- 
cator in the great machine. 
Let us point out plainly what Dewey has accomplished 
and what remains to be done. -In place of the old- 
fashioned objective idealism which has grown somewhat 
stiff in the joints, he has put a volitional, experimental 
spirit which is willing to take risks, ready to adapt itself 
to new environments. For such a volitional, experi- 
mental teleology he claims a higher ideality than is pos- 
sessed by idealism itself. Values, he insists, cannot be 
both ideal and given, and their ‘‘ given ’’ character is 
emphasized, not transformed when they are called eter- 
nal and absolute. But natural values become ideal the 
moment their maintenance is dependent upon the inten- 
tional activities of an empirical agent. 
To uphold this view of his Dewey has final recourse to 
Darwinism. In laying hands upon the sacred ark of 
absolute permanency, in treating the forms that had
-P-A-G-E-313
  
THE CHICAGO SCHOOL: JOHN DEWEY 305 
been regarded as types of fixity and perfection as origi- 
nating and passing away, the Origin of Species, he tells 
us, introduced a mode of thinking that in the end was 
bound to transform the logic of knowledge and hence 
the treatment of morals, politics, and religion. Here 
the touchstone was the old problem of design versus 
chance, mind versus matter, as the causal explanation, 
first or final, of things. The classic notion was that 
within natural sensible events there is contained a spirit- 
ual causal force which as spiritual escapes perception, 
but is apprehended by an enlightened reason. The Dar- 
winian principle of natural selection cuts straight under 
this philosophy. If all organic adaptations are due sim- 
ply to constant variation and elimination of those varia- 
tions harmful in that struggle for existence that is 
brought about by excessive reproduction, there is no call 
for a prior intelligent causal force to plan and pre- 
ordain them. 
We have here the familiar antithetical treatment of 
the problem of purpose. Darwinism and design are 
looked at as if they were oil and water, and would not 
mix. Hence Dewey undervalues any attempts at recon- 
ciliation or mediation. He mentions Asa Gray as favor- 
ing the Darwinian principle and, at the same time, at- 
tempting to reconcile it with design. He calls Gray’s view 
“* design on the installment plan ’’: if we conceive the 
“* stream of variations ”’ to be itself independent, we may 
suppose that each successive variation was designed from 
the first to be selected. Now, this view of Gray’s was 
based on Darwin’s assertion that it was ‘‘ impossible to 
conceive this immense and wonderful universe, including 
man with his capacity of looking far backwards and 
far into futurity, as the result of blind chance or neces- 
sity.’’ Yet Dewey in turn claims Darwin’s refusal to be
-P-A-G-E-314
  306 PRAGMATISM 
offset by the great evolutionist’s conviction that, since 
variations are in useless as well as in useful directions, 
and since the latter are sifted out simply by the stress 
of the conditions for the struggle for existence, the 
design argument as applied to living beings is unjusti- 
fiable, and its lack of support there deprives it of scien- 
tific value. 
Dewey concludes that the impossibility of assigning 
the world to chance as a whole, and to design in its parts, 
indicates the insolubility of the question. For this in- 
solubility he offers two reasons: one is that the problem 
is too high for intelligence; the other is that the ques- 
tion, in its very asking, makes assumptions that render 
the question meaningless. Once admit that the sole 
verifiable or fruitful object of knowledge is the particu- 
lar set of changes that generate the object of study, to- 
gether with the consequences that then flow from it, and 
no intelligible question can be asked about what, by as- 
sumption, lies outside. 
Here is a maze of objections which needs to be ex- 
plored. We make bold to suggest that the problem is 
not fairly stated. Possibly the maze does not end in a 
blind alley. There may be a way out. If the cause of 
the evolutionary flux lies outside, of course the prob- 
lem is insoluble, or, what amounts to the same thing, the 
problem is too high for intelligence. But suppose we 
go back to the classie notion so excellently restated by the 
writer. By assuming a spiritual causal force and mak- 
ing it immanent, we may have a suggestion of a solution. 
The prime cause in this case might be an internal per- 
fecting principle, a force that here and now is coming to 
fruition. This is Aristotle’s entelechy, enlarged to cos- 
mic dimensions. As rational it may, after all, be appre- 
hended by an enlightened reason. If we insist on the  
-P-A-G-E-315
  
  THE CHICAGO SCHOOL: JOHN DEWEY 307 
distinction that it may be apprehended, not compre- 
hended, we escape, on the one hand, absolute agnosticism, 
and, on the other, an absolute all-knower. Granted, then, 
an immanent spiritual principle, working itself out day 
by day, we have that clew which Asa Gray used so 
effectively. It is not design ‘‘ on the installment plan,’’ 
as if some designer were hard put in his payments. 
What Gray sought was that internal, immanent, ra- 
tional principle which made natural selection select, 
which sifted out the useless, and which, in the long run, 
has brought a gradual complexity, and, at the same time, 
a gradual improvement. 
If this suggested sketch of ours may be called ab- 
solutism, it is not the kind that Dewey disparages; it does 
not pretend to know it all; it does not assume some far-off 
divine event toward which the whole creation moves. 
For all his strictures upon ‘‘ inclusive first causes ’’ and 
“* exhaustive final goals ’’ we believe that Dewey is not 
without sympathy with this interpretation, which is that 
of the ‘‘ mild-tempered rationalist.’? At any rate, he 
concludes that the influence of Darwinism upon philos- 
ophy was to force upon it modesty and responsibility, for 
it has shifted its interest from an intelligence that shaped 
things once for all, to the particular intelligences which 
things are even now shaping; from an ultimate goal of 
good to the direct increments of justice and happiness 
that intelligent administration of existent conditions 
may beget. 
This is the creed of the Chicago school. Beginning 
with the principle of Peirce as a method to clear up our 
ideas, to settle metaphysical puzzles, it develops into in- 
strumentalism, or the view that all our theories are men- 
tal modes of adaptation to reality. This instrumentalism, 
in turn, approaches humanism, yet not so as to make the
-P-A-G-E-316
  308 PRAGMATISM 
human or personal an ultimate, but only a tool in genetic 
development, a function in social improvement. This is 
Dewey’s estimate of his own position and, at the same 
time, a forecast of what his successor was to do. The 
moment the complicity of the personal factor in our 
philosophic valuation is recognized fully, frankly, and 
generally, he concludes, that moment a new era in 
philosophy will begin. 
4, Tue Campripge ScHooL: WILLIAM JAMES 
The new era predicted by Dewey was inaugurated by 
William James of Harvard. Pragmatism, he tells us in 
his Lowell Lectures of 1906, has rather suddenly pre- 
cipitated itself out of the air, because in the history of 
philosophy we are beginning to recognize the clash of 
human temperaments. 
Thus begins the third phase in the pragmatic move- 
ment,—the temperamental. The change is significant. 
It is a change from the logical to the psychological, a 
process which reduces the cognition of truth to the satis- 
faction of felt needs, to the emotional thrill. Now, while 
Dewey has warned us against the surrender to the emo- 
tional, James accepts it as a prime criterion whereby 
first to judge past philosophy, then to form the philos- 
ophy of the future. h 
The professional has-hitherto 
urged impersonal reasons for his conclusion. Yet all the 
time he has been following that view of the universe 
which best suits his temperament; that he trusts, that 
is the potentest of all his premises. If distinctive tem- 
peraments have been recognized in other branches of 
activity, why not in philosophy? In government there 
has been authoritarian and anarchist; in literature pu-

THE CAMBRIDGE SCHOOL: WILLIAM JAMES 309 
rists and realists; in art classics and romantics. So in 
philosophy we have a very similar contrast expressed in 
the pair of terms ‘‘ rationalists ’’ and ‘‘ empiricists ; ’’— 
“« empiricist ’? meaning your lover of facts in all their 
erude variety, ‘‘ rationalist ’’ your devotee to abstract 
and eternal principles. In fine, the two types of mental 
make-up may have their characteristics written down in 
two columns. On the one side is the rationalist, who 
is idealistic, optimistic, religious, free-willist, monistic, 
dogmatical. On the other side is the empiricist, who 
is materialistic, pessimistic, irreligious, fatalistic, plural- 
istic, skeptical. 
“At the first glance the drawing up of this table of 
contrast between the ‘‘ tough-minded ’’ empiricist and 
the “‘ tender-minded ’’ rationalist seems to commit the 
same fault as that with which the absolutists were 
charged. It postwtatestheses, assumes-thicir antitheses 
or togicat opposites, ant-oncludes that man must belong 
either to one set or the other. ;It is the same sort of 
artificial depiction of character ‘that was committed by 
Macaulay in his contrasted portraits of Cavalier and 
Roundhead. hput the deadly parallel column is one 
thing, live people anothery In fact, James confesses 
that most of us have a hankering for the good things 
on both sides of the line. Let us, therefore, adopt a 
sort of pluralistic monism (for both facts and prin- 
ciples are good). Let us combine practical pessimism 
with metaphysical optimism (for though the evil of the 
parts is undehiable, the whole cannot be evil). Finally, 
let our scientific spirit be devout, otherwise we will 
find an empirical philosophy which is not religious 
enough, and a religious philosophy that is not em- 
pirical enough. . . . Thus may pragmatism be a media- 
tion between tough-mindedness and tender-mindedness,

  310 PRAGMATISM 
thus may tenderfoot Bostonians mingle with Rocky 
Mountain toughs. 
This is the Cambridge solution of ‘‘ the present 
dilemma in philosophy.’’ It is the opposite of that of 
the Chicago school. It is not_a logical rejection of 
alternatives, but a psychological adaptation of one to.the 
other. It offers a true humanism, for humanity in its 
choices uses its heart as well as its head. Now,-all this 
seems quite illogical unless it be granted that there is 
a logic of the emotions, based upon grounds of personal 
preference. Such grounds James brings forward in his 
lecture on ‘‘ Some Metaphysical Problems Pragmatically 
Considered.’’ In this he assumes his réle as a mediator. 
This was made possible by his personality, combining 
as it did a genial hospitality to all forms of thought 
with a marked boldness in undertaking difficult tasks. 
His pragmatism becomes to philosophy, then, what a 
court of arbitration is to capital and labor,—an organ — 
of mediation between arrogant rationalism and com- 
placent common sense. The new system, like its author, 
is essentially independent; it follows neither the pro- 
fessional philosopher on his high a priori road, nor the 
man in the street with his cocksure notions of truth. 
Rather does it strive to tread a path between the two, 
a via media from which may be obtained the ideal out- 
look of the one and the concrete practicality of the other. 
In this rédle of mediation pragmatism exhibits its adapt- 
ability to modern demands. Finding the world sick of 
abstractions and, at the same time, uninspired by the 
current beliefs, it offers itself as a tonic for tired minds, 
a pungent compound which will restore the jaded appe- 
tite for the speculative life. 
Such a mediating part James had once hoped the 
Chicago school would undertake. That school, however, 
 
-P-A-G-E-319
THE CAMBRIDGE SCHOOL: WILLIAM JAMES 311 
left the impression of being hostile to the abstract, the 
a priori. Coming from a new part of the country it was 
typically averse to the old culture. It is not so with 
the Eastern philosopher, who offers pragmatism as a 
means of satisfying both kinds of demand, remaining 
religious like the rationalisms, but, like the empiricisms, 
preserving the richest intimacy with facts. This is again 
a recourse to the pragmatic method as primarily one 
of settling metaphysical disputes that otherwise might 
be interminable. Is the world one or many ?—fated or 
free?—material or spiritual? Disputes over such no- 
tions are unending, unless we try to interpret each no- 
tion by tracing its respective consequences. 
Thus does James ingeniously escape the dilemma of 
Dewey. Instead of a process of mutual cancellation be- 
tween different alternatives, he holds that alternatives 
with no practical consequences are not really differences. 
Thus science and metaphysics come together, for theories 
being instruments, not answers to enigmas, pragmatism 
unstiffens all our theories, limbers them up and sets 
each one at work. . . . Here is temperamental philosophy 
of the highest kind. James calls it democratic, but we 
should prefer to call it urbane. It does not accentuate 
local differences, but accepts cues from all quarters. 
Such pragmatism, as its author explains, is willing to 
take anything, to follow either logic or the senses and to 
count as proof the humblest and most personal experi- 
ences; she is completely genial; she will entertain any 
hypothesis; she will consider any evidence. 
James shows in this the enthusiastic urbanity of a 
man of wide and varied. activities. The artist in him 
comes out in the contrasted portraits of rationalist and 
empiricist, where he strives to give an impression by 
constant minute touches, and thus to let us see the mas- 
 
-P-A-G-E-320
  312 PRAGMATISM 
terpiece in the making. The physiologist is evident in 
the emphasis on the bodily, realistic side of life, where 
he shows his preference for warm vitality and thus al- 
lows us to catch the essential personal flavor. The 
psychologist we see in the stress on the emotions, in the 
emphasis on the conative side of life. Here James asks 
us: How does the world feel to you? What are the 
thoughts that thrill you? Finally, the religionist ap- 
pears in the use of the Absolute as a source of spiritual 
comfort. As the author of the Varieties of Religious 
Experience James draws on his immense stores of knowl- 
edge—from the strange cases of psychic-research, to 
the mysticism of William Penn, landed proprietor, and 
of John Bunyan, tinker. 
An enthusiastic urbanity, a many-sided personality 
furnish the equipment of James, the mediator in meta- 
physics. So equipped he turns to some metaphysical 
problems which are to be pragmatically considered. 
Here pragmatism means not the bare presentation of ab- 
stract outlines, but a helpful method of tracing specific 
consequences of any given hypothesis. Assuming the 
empiricist attitude, it turns toward concreteness and 
adequacy, toward fact, toward action, and toward power. 
How is one to choose, say, between optimism and pessi- 
mism? By its effects on practical living, responds the 
pragmatist; one naturally accepts the former doctrine 
because it gives a happier view of the world. Or, again, 
what practical difference does it make now that the world 
should be thought to be run by spirit or by matter? In 
the one case there would be the hypothesis of an eternal 
perfect edition of the universe coexisting with our finite 
experience, in the other the hypothesis of blind physical 
forces, bits of brute matter unconsciously following their 
particular laws. Between theism and materialism, thus
-P-A-G-E-321
THE CAMBRIDGE SCHOOL: WILLIAM JAMES 313 
presented, it is impossible to choose hypothetically, but 
apply the principle of practical results and there is vital 
difference. The one hypothesis is pessimistic, its sun 
sets in a sea of disappointment; the other is melioristic 
and means the preservation of our ultimate hopes, since 
it is not blind force, but a seeing foree, which runs this 
universe. So likewise with the controversy between 
determinism and free-will; pragmatism rids one of Puri- 
tanism, drives away the vapors of a bilious conscience, 
and puts man, if not on the road to perfectibility, at 
least into the fresh fields of independent action. 
Thus briefly does James settle metaphysical problems 
by the pragmatic method. Using the test of tempera- 
mental likings he has been accused of confusing the true 
with the pleasant and of making the ground of prefer- 
ence merely personal. The first charge is that of hedon- 
ism, the second that of solipsism. Neither charge is 
wholly warranted. Pragmatism takes account of evil 
and will accept a God who ‘‘ lives in the very dirt of 
private fact.’? Again pragmatism is not a narrow indi- 
vidualism. It holds that truth is made by society, and 
is only a collective name for verification. Being a 
social product it may, therefore, be called a species of 
higher hedonism. Thereby is it relieved of the accusa- 
tion of keeping its eyes bent on the immediate practical 
foreground, for it dwells just as much upon the world’s 
remotest perspectives. In this defense James, the medi- 
ator and smoother-over of transitions, gains a certain 
likeness to the absolutist, for he adds that the absolute 
things, the last things, the overlapping things, are the 
truly philosophic concerns. But we should interpret 
this as due not so much to the absolutistic as to the 
_ esthetic motive, the artist’s interest in vanishing points 
and disappearing lines. And along with it we must put  
-P-A-G-E-322
  314 PRAGMATISM 
the pragmatic check. James speaks of the vast drifting 
of the cosmic weather, yet he does not imply that there 
is such a thing as a meteorology of metaphysics. He 
argues that we cannot by any possibility comprehend the 
character of a cosmic mind whose purposes are fully 
revealed by the strange mixture of goods and evils that 
we find in this world’s particulars. Apparently an es- 
thetic union obtains among things; they tell a story; 
their parts hang together so as to work out a climax. 
But absolute esthetic union is another barely abstract 
idea; until we can affirm one sovereign purpose, sys- 
tem, story, the world appears as something more epic 
than dramatic. 
The Cambridge pragmatist now reaches another of his 
mediations. It is in epistemology, the problem of knowl- 
edge, and concerns the choice between absolutism and 
agnosticism. When he affirms that in this world there 
are as many disjunctions as conjunctions, and hence there 
can be no one knower, no all-enveloping, noetic unity, 
we are forced into that modern form of skepticism re- 
garding a universal substance. If there be such a cosmic 
connective tissue, the human observer has not yet learned 
to stain it—such seems to be his conclusion. In the same 
way we may interpret the allied problem of cosmology, 
the ancient puzzle of ‘‘the one and the many.’’ 
Accepting design, free-will, the absolute mind, spirit in- 
stead of matter, because they have for their sole mean- 
ing a better promise as to this world’s outcome, pragmat- 
ism suddenly abandons this monistic point of view and 
takes up with a pluralistic. This at first appears un- 
natural; it is as if an American of the strict construc- 
tionist type should suddenly give up the idea of the 
paramountecy of the federal government and become a 
violent advocate of States’ rights. And yet this ap-
-P-A-G-E-323
  
  THE CAMBRIDGE SCHOOL: WILLIAM JAMES 315 
parent reversal of judgment has its reasons; namely, the 
temperamental preferences of the author for that rich 
medley of facts called the world, rather than for that 
risky dogma of an absolutely perfect universe. Here 
the monist might be compared to the protectionist, who 
argues that if one break be allowed in the sacrosanct. 
tariff system the whole will fall to the ground. To this 
philosophic stand-patter comes pragmatism unstiffening 
his theories, showing that this is no more the best of all 
possible worlds than that the present is the best of all 
possible administrations, and that pluralism, like States’ 
rights, is necessary to the free play of parts so conducive 
to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Pragmat- 
ism, then, it is said, pending the final empirical ascer- 
tainment of just what the balance of union and dis- 
union among things may be, must obviously range itself 
upon the pluralistic side and sincerely entertain the 
hypothesis of a world imperfectly unified still. Hence 
the actual world, instead of being complete ‘‘ eternally,”’ 
as the monists assure us, may be eternally incomplete 
and at all times subject to addition or liable to loss. 
The adoption of the temperamental test has led to 
pluralism. Its later application to religion is made in a 
startling form of polytheism. Meanwhile James takes 
up the discussion of truth, first in its relations to com- 
mon sense, and then in its higher scientific and social 
aspects. The former discussion is one of the least satis- 
factory in the book. It defends noetic pluralism on the 
ground that we can know the parts and some of their 
combinations, but not the whole. It defends this view 
by a figure of speech, holding that the universe is not 
a final de luxe edition, but a volume in the making,—it 
might well have been said a loose-leaf ledger. It finally 
gives, as a basis of common sense, Herbert Spencer’s
-P-A-G-E-324
  316 PRAGMATISM 
shallow hypothesis that our fundamental ways of think- 
ing about things are discoveries of exceedingly remote 
ancestors, which have been able to preserve themselves 
throughout the experience of all subsequent time. These 
are the funded truths squeezed from the past, which ap- 
pear natural to us because they were once so fruitful. 
‘We may grant that such common-sense principles are 
survivals of the fittest, but that does not answer the ques- 
tion why they are fit. This problem of the agreement of 
truth and reality, whether there exist principles of 
verity in the very constitution of the cosmos, is left 
to the most crucial and the most difficult chapter of this 
work. In regard to the ‘‘ Notion of Truth ’’ pragmatists 
and intellectualists are both said to accept the dictionary 
definition of truth as agreement of ideas with reality. 
They begin to quarrel only after the question is raised as 
to what may precisely be meant by the term ‘‘ agree- 
ment,’’ and what by the term ‘‘ reality,’’ when reality 
is taken as something for our ideas to agree with. On 
the one hand, the idealists seem to say that our ideas are 
true whenever they are what God means that we ought 
to think about that object; whenever they approach to 
being copies of the Absolute’s eternal way of thinking. 
This is the great assumption of the intellectualists that 
truth means essentially an inert static relation. Prag- 
matism, on the other hand, asks its usual question. 
“ Grant an idea or belief to be true, what concrete dif- 
ference will its being true make in anyone’s actual be- 
lief? How will the truth be realized? What experi- 
ences will be different from those which would obtain if 
the belief were false? What, in short, is the truth’s 
eash-value in the experiential terms? ’’ 
At this hypothetical question the defense is up in 
arms. Practical differences! Cash-values! Such phrases
-P-A-G-E-325
THE CAMBRIDGE SCHOOL: WILLIAM JAMES 317 
pervert the principle of Peirce into a transaction of the 
Chicago clearing-house. Here one critic, adopting a sort 
of slang which pragmatism does not disdain to use, has 
defined truth as ‘‘ Any old thing that works! ”’ 
That pragmatism as a gospel of success is utilitarian 
James frankly grants. The true, he continues, is only 
the expedient in the way of our thinking, just as the 
right is only the expedient in the way of our behaving. 
The first meaning of truth is, therefore, that of a method. 
Primarily it means a leading that is worth while. The 
discovery of a working hypothesis is used by the prag- 
matist in just the way a path is followed by a wanderer, 
because it looks as if it might lead out of the woods. 
Besides being a method of utility, pragmatic truth is a 
theory of reality. You can say of it, then, either that ‘‘ it 
is useful because it is true,’’ or that ‘‘ it is true because 
it is useful.’’ 
In this statement we charge the author with making a 
false conversion of a proposition, in other words of, im- 
plying that it is a poor rule that does not work both 
ways. It is easy to concede the last half of the proposi- 
tion, for that is only saying that true thoughts are 
invaluable instruments of action. But in changing the 
proposition ‘‘ it is true because it works ’’ into ‘‘ it 
works because it is true ’’ we change from an object, a 
successful result, to a notion of some standard upon 
which the workability, the success, depends. Now, this , 
notion of a standard would imply some fixed reality like 
Platonic archetypes, which exist eternally and outside 
human minds. But this is making truth static and de- 
humanizing it, therefore such a view is condemned, be- 
cause pragmatism is dynamic and humanistic. Truth is 
not a fixed standard but a flying goal, and the world we 
know is determined by the human faculties.  
-P-A-G-E-326
  318 | PRAGMATISM 
Platonism and pragmatism are thus at opposite poles. 
The former says our ideas are true if they are ectypes of 
archetypes, shadows or copies of the absolute and eter- 
nal forms of thought. Pragmatism says, truths are not 
copies but consistencies; truths emerge from facts; they 
are not once and forever true but always in the making, 
humanity being the constant creator of working hypothe- 
ses, of tentative theories. By these it adapts itself to 
changing circumstances as does a marching army to the 
rise and fall of the road. This sharp contrast be- 
tween the static and the absolute, between the dynamic 
and relative, is easy to draw because of the current re- 
vival of the ancient Greek conception of cosmic fiuxility, 
of a plastic principle in nature. Conventional monism, 
with its insistence on eternal principles and fixed arche- 
types, will be hard pressed to explain away that mutabil- 
ity in nature, that changing pageantry in earth and sky, 
from which writers like Emerson and Whitman drew 
‘their philosophies. This being the day of the ‘‘ rushing 
metamorphosis,’’ the notion of a finished world is as hard 
to grasp as the notion of a finished waterfall; or, to 
carry out the figure, instead of being immutable, a 
frozen river of reality, truth is ever in mutation, ever 
carried forward on the flowing stream of consciousness. 
This conclusion strikes many as nihilistic. According 
to James the pragmatic theory of reality holds that be- 
hind the bare phenomenal facts there is—nothing. Is 
not this an exaggeration? Though the flowing stream 
of consciousness has no bottom, it has banks and these 
we take to be the human factors, the guiding principles 
furnished by men’s minds. For, as James concedes, 
instead of reality as such, ready-made from all eternity, 
we have a man-made reality. ‘‘ It is we who create true 
principles, in ws reality is in the making and our descrip-
-P-A-G-E-327
THE CAMBRIDGE SCHOOL: WILLIAM JAMES 319 
tions are metaphysical additions to facts.’’ Again in- 
stead of the abstract worship of timeless reality, a pre- 
tense that the eternal is unrolling, we prefer a loose 
universe, truth growing up inside of all the finite experi- 
ences, ‘‘ we men adding our fiats to the fiat of the 
Creator.’’ 
This is the Cambridge theory of reality. It is a 
bold doctrine. It is not merely humanism, but the wor- 
ship of humanity. James recognizes this, and in his 
last chapter, ‘‘ Pragmatism and Religion,’’ reaches his 
final view of truth. Truth is not only a method to gain 
successful results, or a theory of reality as fluxility, but a 
temper of mind, an emotional belief which gives personal 
satisfaction. This satisfaction may be so intense as 
to be justly called a religion, not in the monistic, mystical 
way of pure cosmic emotion, but in the humanistic 
way,—a universe with such as us contributing to create 
its truth, a world delivered to our opportunities and 
our private judgments, where God is viewed as but one 
helper, in the midst of all the shapers of the world’s 
fate. 
At this turn in the road, we have come back to that 
temperamental test with which the book began, namely : 
The whole function of philosophy ought to be to find 
out what definite difference it will make to you and me, 
at definite instants of our life, if this world-formula 
or that world-formula be the true one. The formula 
which James reaches is that of feeling, of instinct, of 
intuition, for in the end he concludes: ‘‘ It is our faith 
and not our logic that decides such questions,—the 
human imagination which lives in a moralistic and epic 
kind of universe, and avoids the two extremes of crude 
naturalism on the one hand, and transcendental abso- 
lutism on the other.’’  
-P-A-G-E-328
  320 PRAGMATISM 
Here ends the pragmatism of James,—carried fur- 
ther, but not essentially changed, in his subsequent 
works, A Pluralistic Universe and The Meaning of Truth. 
But without recourse to these other volumes of delight 
let us summarize the system as James has left it; go back 
to its sources or affiliations, and, finally, attempt to give 
its probable place in the history of American thought. 
5. THE Sources oF PRAGMATISM 
To call the Cambridge pragmatism a system is ap- 
parently a misnomer. At the outset, protests James, it 
stands for no particular results; it has no doctrine save 
its methods. As the young Italian pragmatist, Papini, 
has well said, it lies in the midst of our theories, like a 
corridor in a hotel. Let us grant that pragmatism is this 
corridor, and not a metaphysical roof to cover all; it 
still furnishes a scheme, if not a system. In the case of 
James this scheme is determined by temperamental tests, 
by personal preferences. As a mediator, a man of pacific 
disposition, he is primarily opposed to dogmas. Against 
the must be of the intellectualist he puts the may be 
of the empiricist. Thus the philosophical trinity of the 
absolute idealist would be interpreted as follows: God,— 
a good working hypothesis; immortality,—a vague con- 
fidence in the future; freedom,—a melioristic doctrine 
whereby improvement at least is possible. To abso- 
lutists this may seem like giving up strong meat for 
modified milk, but the Cambridge scheme is not entirely 
negative, does not wholly agree with another dictum of 
Papini’s that ‘‘ pragmatism is really less a philosophy 
than a method of doing without one.’? The American 
species is not invertebrate, it has an historic backbone. 
James says that it agrees with nominalism in appealing
-P-A-G-E-329
(See reat 
THE SOURCES OF PRAGMATISM 321 
to particulars; with utilitarianism in emphasizing prac- 
tical aspects; with positivism in its disdain for meta- 
physical abstractions. In these confessed resemblances 
the author is but carrying out the full title of his book— 
Pragmatism, a New Name for Some Old Ways of 
Thinking. 
‘We may go further. Recalling the title of a quaint 
deistic work—Christianity as Old as the Creation—we 
may speak of ‘‘ Pragmatism as Old as Speculation.”’ 
From the Greeks to modern days the pragmatic stream 
has flowed unbroken. Dewey may disparage the past, 
but the continuity of kindred thought is a fact. We take 
the long leap backward and begin with Heracleitus. His 
doctrine we have already noticed. That all flows, that 
reality is fluxility, that there is no finality in truth—is 
the very soul of the latter-day flowing philosophy. Next, 
the sophistie doctrine, that man is the measure of all 
things, is revived in the modern individualism, where 
there are many men of many minds, and as many kinds 
of reality as there are pragmatists. Schiller of Oxford 
has defended this ancient sophistic doctrine as explain- 
ing the bewildering variety of human customs and be- 
liefs, and enabling men to conceive objective ‘‘ truth,”’ 
not as an initial gift of the gods, but as a practical and 
social problem. The choice then favors Protagoras 
rather than Plato, for the latter’s ideal theory explained 
nothing, just because, by being elevated above the flux, it 
had lost all touch with humanity. 
So much for the agreement with Hellenic thought. 
For the medieval, James has this single word—that prag- 
matism agrees with nominalism in its appeal to particu- 
lars. This means that a name is nothing but a summation 
of experiences, a short cut to reality, not a reality itself. 
This is diametrically opposed to that form of Platonism  
-P-A-G-E-330
322 PRAGMATISM 
revived in scholastic realism which held that back of 
every name there is a reality, a supersensible essence ex- 
isting independent of particulars. 
As pragmatism agrees with empiricism and is opposed 
to transcendentalism ancient and medieval, so does it 
stand in relation to modern empiricism and transcenden- 
talism. In these connections we may take the Western na- 
tions briefly one by one. Among the English we find Lord 
Bacon,—the father of empiricism,—with his saying that 
knowledge is power; John Locke with his habit of testing 
abstract ideas, like substance, in terms of experience; 
David Hume with his attack on intellectualism and his 
advice to throw metaphysics to the flames. As to Hume 
the resemblance between the arch-skeptic and the modern 
sophist is strong. Just as James uses theories as short- 
cuts to reality and advises us to act as if this and that 
were true, so Hume uses belief to bridge over difficulties 
and asks us to invent such a notion as causality as a sort 
of fictitious glue to bind the cosmos together. 
These are the earlier English empiricists. Among the 
later stand forth Darwin and Mill. The parallels with 
the former are obvious: the familiar phrases—adaptation 
to environment, struggle for existence, survival of the 
fittest—are the very watchwords of the modern practical- 
ism. And so is it with John Stuart Mill, to whom James 
dedicates his volume as the one ‘‘ From whom I first 
learned the pragmatic openness of mind and whom my 
fancy likes to picture as our leader were he alive to- 
day.’’ 
So much for the British empiricists. The affinities are 
so strong that pragmatism might almost be called Anglo- 
Americanism. As for the Germans there are few affinities 
acknowledged by the pragmatists themselves. With a 
practical working treaty between the two English-speak-
-P-A-G-E-331
THE SOURCES OF PRAGMATISM 323 
ing countries it might be expected that the Germans 
should be left out. It is worse than that: Against the 
whole tribe of Teutonic idealists there is a chorus of 
objections, strictures, taunts, and vilifications. Thus 
Dewey holds that Kant never emerges from his fallacies, 
and James holds up to derision the ‘‘ hollow god ’’ of 
Hegel. But in spite of James’s protestations that he has 
never received a single clear idea from Kant, there are 
marked resemblances between the philosopher of Koenigs- 
berg and that of Cambridge. Kant’s doctrine of postu- 
lates has a family likeness to James’s Will to Believe. 
**T will that there be a God, in order to the living of 
my moral life ’’ sounds much like James’s exhortations to 
act as if there were a seeing force that runs things. 
Further resemblances have been brought out by Arthur 
McGiffert. In addition to this faith in God as an heroic 
deed, not a passive acquiescence, there is the doctrine of 
meliorism—‘‘ that the world as a whole is always im- 
proving.’? And besides the primacy of the will, the 
recognition of its activity in forming the truth, there is 
the doctrine of humanism,—that man is a factor in the 
making of reality, that there is a plastic world to which 
he gives meaning and value. 
All this sounds, and is very pragmatic. The unprag- 
matic part arises in the monism of Post-Kantian idealism, 
that transcendentalizing of his teachings against which 
the master warned his disciples. In this regard Hegel 
was the chief offender, for he did turn theology into 
theosophy, the postulate of deity as an ‘‘ idea made by 
ourselves with a practical purpose ’’ into an assumption 
that by mere thinking man can find out God. Against 
such a perversion the pragmatists have grounds for pro- 
test. They especially dread that Frankenstein deity,— 
an absolute being derived by the dialectical process of the  
-P-A-G-E-332
ere Se ee ERS Sie PRM te eee ey ea pe ete er eae 
324 PRAGMATISM | 
unfolding of the Idea. We do not pretend to solve the 
secret of Hegel, but we can understand how such formule 
would drive James mad. This rigid doctrine of ‘‘ becom- 
ing ’’ according to preconceived plans would irritate an 
independent American much as might the rules and 
regulations of a bureaucratic police. 
There remains a third German idealist to be reckoned 
with. Schopenhauer’s World as Will might appear akin 
to the Chicago civic motto ‘‘ I Will ’’ and all the implica- 
tions of the strenuous life. In a measure the tran- 
scendental energism does seem like the transatlantic rest- 
lessness. But with the apparent likeness there is a 
fundamental difference. The German’s will is a cosmic 
principle, a hidden fatal force which carries mankind 
irresistibly onward. The American’s will is individual, 
each man is the architect of his own fortune. Now, while 
the false identification of the two schools of energism can- 
not be attributed to Dewey, it might be to James. Some 
take his appeal to the subliminal to be an appeal to the 
transcendental. This is a misinterpretation. The energies 
of men which he bids us use are not beyond experience, 
but only beneath the threshold of consciousness. Fur- 
thermore, there is a confusion of temperaments. To put 
James among the pessimists is an absurdity to one fa- 
miliar with his personality. The will to believe, as his 
compatriots take it, is a will to believe in the better, 
and upon this temperamental quality is based the doc- 
trine of meliorism. The Cambridge thinker would be 
the last to say that there is a final futility in the will, 
and an ultimate necessity for self-denial and self-anni- 
hilation. 
It is easy to see that the resemblances between the 
Teutonic and transatlantic philosophers are less than the 
differences. The same cannot be said of the French. 
   
-P-A-G-E-333
THE SOURCES OF PRAGMATISM 325 
Pragmatism has been charged with being a revamped 
positivism. The resemblances are striking. Both make 
much of science, and in place of absolute causes put rela- 
tive laws. Both emphasize nature and prefer the obser- 
vation of phenomena to metaphysical abstractions. Both 
are enamored of humanity and consider man’s needs 
the ultimate aim of knowledge. In short, both are scien- 
tific, naturalistic, humanistic, and also—somewhat skep- 
tical. They do not care for supersensible realities, like 
first grounds and ultimate principles, but are satisfied 
with the horizon of level experience. They do not seek 
for intellectual unification of all sciences, but are con- 
tent to employ the same method in all cases. 
Is pragmatism, then, a revival of positivism, the 
Cambridge scholar a reincarnation of the Parisian? 
James objected to this implication. Through his early 
education in France he had come into intimate relations 
with the positive point of view, but his return to America 
brought him under different influences. A French critic, 
Abel Rey, has exposed the difference between positivists 
and pragmatists. The former, he explains, are guilty of 
the dogmatism of the idea; pure thought, the correct 
formula is deemed entirely sufficient. The latter are 
guilty of the dogmatism of the act; cognition follows the 
necessities of action. There is no scientific truth, but 
only truths, valuable not in themselves, but only as 
instruments. 
‘We may make the line of cleavage even sharper. With 
Comte there is a worship of reason, and the immutability 
of natural law is fundamental. With James the formula 
of feeling supplements logic, and the neglected emotions 
are given their proper functions of motive forces. 
James’s pragmatism, then, has two focal points different 
from positivism: it is opposed to immutability; it is in
-P-A-G-E-334
  
326 PRAGMATISM 
favor of emotionality. While the latter of these points 
is to be sought in James’s native environment, yet the 
former is still French. When James spoke of all our 
scientific laws being only approximations, our theories 
only conceptual shorthand reports of nature, he was re- 
flecting the views of Poincaré. The method of science, 
says that mathematician, is that a theory is only a trial 
and error scheme; there are thousands of theories, but 
only a few of them fit the facts. The meaning of hy- 
pothesis is then only a working hypothesis, a tool which 
serves to-day, but to-morrow will be thrown on the 
serap-heap. Such a view is congruous to both the schools 
of Chicago and of Cambridge. It is evolutionary. It is 
another instance of the prodigality of nature. The 
theories thrown out by the human mind are like the 
wasted spawn of which only a fraction comes to maturity. 
This view also fits the latter-day flowing philosophy. It 
tends to fluidity of thought rather than to finality of 
truth. There is nothing absolutely true; not even this 
statement. 
All this upholds the contention of James that prag- 
matism is not a revival of the outworn positivism of 
Comte, Renan, and Taine. Positivism is unpragmatic 
in its insistency on the supremacy of reason, and its 
founder maintained that the human spirit should pro- 
ceed to theoretical researches, completely abstracting it- 
self from every practical consideration. On the other 
hand, pragmatism is non-positive in that second point we 
noticed,—emotionality. But positivism is opposed to 
feeling, especially religious feeling. No Comtean would 
put on the same level the experiences of science, of meta- 
physics, and of religion. But this is what the pragmatists 
do; they reverse the positive formula of development— 
the necessary successive phases; theological; metaphysi-
-P-A-G-E-335
THE SOURCES OF PRAGMATISM 327 
cal; positive—when they assert that pragmatism can 
utilize all experiences, from the clearest to the most 
obscure, from the clarities of science to the mysteries of 
the subconscious. 
We have gone through the forerunners of pragmatism, 
ancient, medieval, and modern, and have discovered that 
the pragmatists, although contemners of the past, have 
had numerous predecessors. With the sophistiec doc- 
trine the affinities are more than superficial, with the 
nominalistic more than nominal. But with the modern 
the perspective is closer and distinctions loom into differ- 
ences. Although pragmatism is so largely Anglo-Amer- 
ican, the American movement is not entirely a revival 
of British empiricism. To Bacon’s knowledge is power, 
James adds, knowledge is also satisfaction. To Locke’s 
two inlets of knowledge, sensation and reflection, he adds 
volition. Against Hume’s conception of religion as an 
outworn superstition, an invention of priests, he puts 
religious experience as an outcome of the passional needs 
of humanity. James is the brother of the British em- 
piricists; he is likewise their older brother,—older in 
time and with a wider outlook. As Dickinson Miller has 
pointed out, they asked—whence it came; he asks— 
whither it goes; they asked—what were the originals of 
the conception; he asks—what is to be the effect upon 
future practical experience. 
Pragmatism is not merely an Anglo-Saxon plant, nor 
does it grow solely from Continental roots. The alleged 
affinities disappear on closer scrutiny. The pragmatic 
principle cannot be identified with Kant’s practical pos- 
tulate in either of its two senses. It is not constitutive, 
like a constitution which determines the very growth of 
the body politic. It is not regulative, like the governor 
of an engine which controls the safety-valve. It is 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
  328 PRAGMATISM 
merely heuristic,—a means of finding one’s way out of 
a maze of difficulties. Again the pragmatic principle 
is an individual rule, which can be made and remade to 
suit changing demands. Hence it is opposed to Hegel’s 
dialectic. His scheme of evolution is like the unwinding 
of a ball of string, previously wound up by a machine— 
the machine in this case being formal logic. Finally, 
there is opposition to the spirit of Schopenhauer. To 
the pessimist the world as will comes to consciousness, 
only to discover the futility of that will. To the prag- 
matist there is no cosmic consciousness, but only a so- 
cial consciousness, driving the more powerful on to 
become lords of this earth. If there were an essential 
affinity between the pragmatists and the Germans it 
would be through Nietzsche. Those overlords of the 
American business world, whose motto is ‘‘ success at all 
hazards,’’ are first-cousins to the Teutonic superman, 
who works in a realm ‘‘ beyond good and evil.’’ 
So the rise of pragmatism is not to be sought in the 
Fatherland either through the Anglo-Hegelians or 
through the St. Louis school, except in the way of a re- 
coil against their transcendentalism. Fichte, indeed, 
taught in his Vocation of Man that things in them- 
selves are as we make them. But the few Fichtean in- 
dividualists in the Middle West were swallowed up by 
the Hegelian absolutists. If we may say that the im- 
pulse to pragmatism did not come from Germany, the 
case is not so clear as to France. The unpracticality of 
positivism is a forgotten phase of that Gallic cult which, 
at one time, had such a vogue in America. So is the 
mysticism of Comte’s later days. Unpracticality is, of 
course, unpragmatic, but mysticism is not, unless the 
scheme of James be counted a form of perverted prag- 
matism. Consequently there is a curious resemblance
-P-A-G-E-337
THE SOURCES OF PRAGMATISM 329 
between the French and American thinkers. We find 
Comte’s love of humanity taking a mystic turn, only 
after he had exhausted the possibilities of the sciences. 
Facts were one thing, feelings another. Hence positivism 
had as its supplement that religion which worships hu- 
manity itself as le grand étre. Of this worship Comte 
considered himself the high priest, as shown in his Posi- 
tive Catechism, or Summary Exposition of the Universal 
Religion. But such documents came forth a generation 
before they could have directly influenced William 
James. For the latter’s mysticism we must therefore 
seek, not a foreign, but a native and more intimate 
source. Henry James, Sr., was the leader of American 
Swedenborgianism, and to this fact we may trace the 
son’s inherited interest in a cult which taught the 
primacy of the emotional imagination. This reversion 
to a youthful form of thought goes far to explain the 
motives that turned James the scientist into James the 
religionist. Among the Varieties of Religious Experi- 
ence we find many cases like those of the seer of Stock- 
holm. In the Will to Believe there is also advocated the 
“< right to believe ’’ in the celestial world. Finally in the 
Pluralistic Universe there is presented that hierarchy of 
superhuman beings, which have a family likeness to the 
Swedenborgian conception of the world as a progressive 
spiral of perfectibility. To read the chapter ‘‘ Concern- 
ing Fechner,’’ with its earth-soul and its multi-verses, is 
like reading the Harths in the Universe and the Heavenly 
Arcana. 
All this has been called the logic of irrationalism. It 
should rather be called a reversion to a type of tran- 
scendentalism. The ‘‘ faith ventures’? and ‘‘ over- 
beliefs ’? which James advocated, were much like the 
supersensible faculties and Over-Soul to which Emerson
-P-A-G-E-338
  
330 PRAGMATISM 
appealed. In short, the philosophers of Concord and 
of Cambridge both utilized the celestial. One said 
‘“‘ Hitch your wagon to a star ’’; the other—‘‘ Hitch 
your star to a wagon,”’ that is, accept, for the time be- 
ing, any sort of a creed, provided it will furnish you 
with motive power. 
In this very emotional resemblance there nevertheless 
lurks a deeper difference. With transcendentalism the 
notion of truth is unconditional, it is a copy of a higher 
reality. With pragmatism truth is not a copy but a 
consistency ; there is nothing in your mind to condition 
it except certain racial inclinations. According to tran- 
scendentalism, truth is received from on high. According 
to pragmatism, truth happens to an idea; it becomes 
true, is made true by events. In fine, pragmatism as 
radical empiricism means simply truth as you go along. 
This casual view of truth may be called the hall-mark 
of pragmatism. It is that which differentiates it from 
previous movements native and foreign. It is that which 
puts it in the stream of present tendencies, the rapid 
current of modernism, which washes away the banks of 
tradition. As with ‘‘new’’ art, or ‘‘new’’ music, 
pragmatism is a movement opposed to the dogmatic, the 
absolute. As soon as a notion is fixed, a scheme sys- 
tematized, it moves restlessly on. The spur of dissatis- 
faction of Peirce leads on to the test of satisfaction of 
Dewey, and this in turn to the fresh emotional responses 
of James. To picture pragmatism is to picture a rapid 
stream, eating away the fixed landmarks of custom and 
convention. A radical upholder of pragmatism has gone 
so far as to compare it to an evolutionary Niagara, whose 
being is doing, whose end is action. 
To judge of the movement by one’s emotional response, 
it gives one first a feeling of ease, of floating with that 
 
-P-A-G-E-339
  
THE CRITICS OF PRAGMATISM 331 
current of modernism which is no longer confined by the 
canons of art, or literature, or religion. It next gives one 
a feeling of being lost, of being carried on in a waste of 
waters, not only without bottom but without banks. This 
is a mixed feeling and it leads to a mixed conclusion, 
and that is that pragmatism is not a conclusive philos- 
ophy, but only a transitional era in thought. With 
Peirce it is a mere method; with Dewey a useful tool; 
while with James it leads not to a system but a scheme, 
which may contain such inconsistencies as a pluralistic 
monism, and free-willist determinism. 
6. Tue Critics or PRAGMATISM 
Whether pragmatism is merely a transitional cine 
transformation phase, adform-ofProtagoreanisit which 
presages another Plato—is-hard for an American to 
decide. The swimmer in the flood is apt to lose his bear- 
ings. This being the case, let-us turn to foreign opinions 
for a decision. We have the picture of pragmatism; let” 
us hang it in the international gallery and obtain the ver- 
dict of an impartial jury. From this jury we must ex- 
clude the English pragmatists, because they are too much 
of a single philosophic family, although we should par- 
ticularly like to accept the opinion of Schiller of Oxford 
when he calls William James ‘‘ the last great emanci- 
pator of the human spirit.” 
The Germans we must exclude for the opposite rea- 
son. They have been violent detractors of pragmatism, 
possibly because they have for once been caught napping 
in the speculative race. Even the urbane James cannot 
stand their strictures, and accuses them of being misin- 
terpreters of the movement. With the other Continental 
critics it is different. It is the Latins who are especially 
 
-P-A-G-E-340
  332 PRAGMATISM 
fitted to interpret our ways of thinking—the French for 
their clarity of style and luminous vision, the Italians 
for their penetrating practicality and social instincts. 
We begin with the Gauls because they, in a sort of liter- 
ary revenge for the material partition of their country, 
have become adepts in the intellectual delimitation of 
other realms. Many of these critical Cesars_are known 
for their commentaries, but not all.We are familiar 
with the conquerors and classifiers of the dark continent 
of Kant, but not-with those of the land of James. Here 
is a new race, they exclaim 3, no_one has-understoodits— 
let_us,therefore, undertake-thetask_of setting in order 
these_ transatlantic barbarians. When,—says—Marcel- 
Hébert, [fist heard the word pragmatism, fancied it

without affinities with James and-Peiree.—Thus Bergson 
attacks the so-called general truths of science, and traces 
the hypothesis to-a personal source-—So,too,-Maurice 
Blondel advocates-a method which would confront the 
various systems of intellectualism, from Descartes to 
Taine, from the point of view of practical consequences. 
This attitude of gleaning the practical factors from 
rationalistic systems is what Abel Rey designates as the 
new tone in philosophy. It is not an eclectic positivism, 
for positivism lays too much stress on pure science, and 
tends to disregard the emotional and passional side of 
life. Nor is it the French neo-criticism which piously 
hands down the traditions of absolutism from Descartes 
to Hegel. The latter group of thinkers is a mere survival 
of the past; somewhat fossilized, it has not taken ac- 
count of the anti-intellectual and mystical current, which 
starts with Schelling and Schopenhauer in their re- 
habilitation of the indeterminate, the unconscious, the 
irrational. Hence it is that recourse should be had to 
the aspirations of the heart, to the obscurer instincts of 
humanity. True knowledge is, in fine, to be sought not 
from positivistic science, not from proud intellectualism, 
but in the intuitions of sentiment, in moral ideas, in re-
-P-A-G-E-342
  334 PRAGMATISM 
ligious beliefs. . . . Of all these pragmatism is the 
synthesis. 
From the French critics thus far cited it is evident 
that the western Goth is, after all, not so barbarous, but 
well in the vanguard of progress. At the last Interna- 
tional Congress of Philosophy Emile Boutroux showed 
how, of the two dominant groups of thought, the prag- 
matists have assumed the most advanced position. On 
the one hand are the intellectualists who, completely 
satisfied with science, believe that there is little knowl- 
edge outside its boundaries. On the other are the anti- 
intellectualists, who, going beyond the present limits of 
science, honor certain irrational powers of the human 
soul, such as instinct, intuition, the sense of action. 
Berthelot stands for the former group; inheritor of the 
doctrines of the eighteenth century, successor of the 
Encyclopxdists, he makes a religion of science and be- 
lieves that it is the sole irrefragable foundation for the 
morality of races as well as of individuals. Up to 1890, 
continues André Chaumeix, such a réle was held by sci- 
ence in philosophy, sociology, and morality. But in 
1893 Emile Boutroux maintained against the mechanism 
and materialism of the scientists the notions of liberty 
and spirituality. Next, Ferdinand Brunetiére followed 
with his attack on the fallacies of science, and showed 
that phenomena are always in formation and that opin- 
ions must be modified by new experiences. Finally, 
Henri Poincaré, criticising the values of the sciences, 
showed that, in place of the fixity of general ideas, we 
must hold to the relativity of hypotheses, that the sim- 
plicity of nature is but a convenient convention, and 
that scientific formule are but approximate accommoda- 
tions to reality. 
Such are the Franeo-American affiliations, the points
-P-A-G-E-343
  
THE CRITICS OF PRAGMATISM 335 
of sympathy which have brought about a philosophic 
entente cordiale between the two republics, and have led 
to the visits to our shores of two such distinguished 
thinkers as Hmile Boutroux, head of the Fondation 
Thiers, and Henri Bergson, author of Creative Evolution. 
These are the affiliations ; naturally there are accompany- 
ing differences. Briefly there are two,—one of them re- 
specting learning, the other religion. The contempt for 
culture strikes all the French observers as an earmark of 
the Anglo-American movement. Bourdeau shows how 
the hostility to rationalism makes a tabula rasa of all that 
is not English or American. Descartes, Leibniz, and 
Kant do not exist for the pragmatist; with him, as with 
Herbert Spencer and Lord Bacon, there is manifest a 
positive disdain for past thought. Chaumeix has noticed 
the same thing; Rey devotes a chapter to the pragmatic 
disregard for the traditional solutions of the problems 
of truth; while Hébert neatly turns the tables by asking 
if these contemners of the past have not, in fact, had 
numerous predecessors. The latter’s search for sources 
is perhaps carried to excess; he has made too many of 
the historic figures pragmatists unconscious of their 
pragmatism. But the historical comparison is the only 
way to get the correct perspective, the relative point of 
view so often forgotten by transitionalists. 
The second point of difference concerns religion. In 
this there are two opinions, one of recoil, the other of 
ridicule. Hébert estimates American pragmatism from 
the cautious Catholic point of view. In regard to the 
theistic conception he agrees with James that, as an over- 
belief, it is true because it is so useful; but he recoils from 
the representation of the relation between man and the 
higher spirits as that of dogs and cats towards their 
masters. This sort of Pickwickian humor, which has  
-P-A-G-E-344
  336 PRAGMATISM 
attracted other Gallic writers, does not appeal to one who 
holds that the deity is an object of worship, not merely 
because he is primus inter pares, but because he is the 
possessor of infinite perfections. To this modern scholas- 
tic, then, God is to be estimated not solely ex conse- 
quentiis, but rather as an objective reality raised far 
above the level of probability. In fine, since human na- 
ture is capable of seeing for the sake of seeing, of 
knowing for the sake of knowing, it is necessary, over 
and above such an utilitarian pragmatism, to affirm the 
excellence of pure disinterestedness. 
In regard to mysticism it seems to Bourdeau a para- 
dox that a Yankee philosophy should lead to such a result. 
While the French critic refers this to a reaction against 
scientific snobbism, tracing it through the pragmatic ap- 
peal from the intellect to the emotions, in the case of 
James an American might prefer to trace the latter’s 
mystic leanings to a directly inherited interest in 
Swedenborgianism. But, whatever the source, it is a 
veritable paradox that Occidental thought is approxi- 
mating Oriental. The American mind-cure has no his- 
toric connections, as Bourdeau would hold, with the 
spiritual exercises of Ignatius de Loyola. Except for 
the Quakers, mystic manuals have had little vogue among 
the cultivated classes in our land. Rather should this 
so-called auto-imperialism, this revived Yoga system, be 
traced to the Platonic element in New England Puritan- 
ism, and more especially to Emerson’s interest in the 
sacred books of the East. It is, therefore, not untrue to 
say that the most ingenious of the modern remedies 
against the evils which assail us was discovered in 
America in the mind-cure, the gospel of relaxation, the 
“‘ don’t worry ’’ movement. And an American, cog- 
nizant of this degraded form of New England transcen-
-P-A-G-E-345
  THE CRITICS OF PRAGMATISM 337 
dentalism, this perversion of the Emersonian doctrines of 
self-reliance and compensation, can agree with the witty 
Gaul when he compares the mind-cure to the grinding 
of the soul, like a hand-organ, for the sake of those opti- 
mistic previsions: ‘‘ Fata viam inveniant; tout s’arran- 
gera, parbleu! parfait! bravo! ’’ 
In pointing out the deficiency of the current prag- 
matism from the point of view of theology the French 
criticism has reached its highest point. We may, there- 
fore, turn to the Italian attitude towards this subject. 
It is Alessandro Chiapelli who has most successfully ex- 
posed the insufficiency of opportunism for the deeper 
problems of thought and life. To him the recent 
renaissance of philosophy in America and France has 
shown a veritable originality of the speculative spirit, a 
new restlessness against the older forms of thought. The 
very revolt against the great dogmatic systems has in- 
cluded a revolt against science itself. Pragmatism is a 
proof of this. Its very discontent with intellectualism 
betokens a wider vision. In giving play to the emo- 
tional and the passional, in emphasizing the primacy of 
will, it tends towards an idealism transcending mere 
utilitarianism. 
Chiapelli here brings to notice the latent idealism in 
the American nature with which the primitive prag- - 
matist, the Yankee exponent of mere success, is bound to 
reckon. The principle of Peirce, which resolves our 
choice of speculative systems into a game of pitching 
pennies, cannot hold indefinitely in a land which has 
known Emerson and harbored Berkeley. The latter’s 
subjective idealism Chiapelli considers to be revived in 
James’s humanism. Whether such idealism can be ren- 
dered objective, and therefore serve as a check to the 
radical pragmatic empiricism, is problematic.
-P-A-G-E-346
  338 PRAGMATISM 
Italian modernism as a partial reflection of the new 
humanism furnishes a suggestive hint as to the theologice 
fate of American pragmatism. The Italian clergy at 
first eagerly grasped a doctrine which would rehabilitate 
a waning faith. The first work in James’s trilogy 
gave to religious beliefs a new vogue. But the second 
of these works burned the fingers of the orthodox. The 
Fechnerian hierarchy of world-souls advocated in 
A Pluralistic Universe could scarcely be understood, 
much less accepted, outside of Swedenborgian and pos- 
sibly Mormon circles! The Italian critic is, therefore, 
right in presaging little success amongst us for this re- 
vival of animism and polytheism. If he had known the 
rigors of monotheism in America, he might justly have 
called James a sort of Yankee Julian the Apostate. In 
all this an essential weakness of pragmatism is implied. 
As a cosmology it is an historic retrogression. As Chia- 
pelli observes, the religious conscience has reached the 
highest point of its evolution in monotheism. So while 
a pluralistic conception may be just, as a natural protest 
against a too abstract absolutism, yet ultimately that 
pluralism is nothing but an empirical and provisional 
view, an atomistic form like that of the cell in a monad- 
ology. 
How, then, can pragmatism and rationalism be recon- 
ciled? In the modern renaissance of spiritual values, in 
the attempts to complete science, justify religion, and 
ennoble life, there is, as Chiapelli declares, something 
really solemn. In the rise of American pragmatism there 
is, therefore, more than a grandiose manifestation of 
energy brought out in a young civilization greedy of 
imperialism. Rather is it a new philosophy of faith and 
feeling necessary to establish the human equilibrium 
after the negations of agnosticism and the limitations of 
 
-P-A-G-E-347
  THE CRITICS OF PRAGMATISM 339 
criticism. For these words from a foreign observer an 
American may be grateful. But is it possible to bring 
about that suggested reconciliation between pragmatism 
and rationalism? Hébert had expressed a pious wish 
for that result, in his hope that the twentieth century 
would see a closer union of positive science and specula- 
tive philosophy. And while Chiapelli believes that the 
contrast between the new radical empiricism of the 
pragmatists and the rationalism of the idealists is not an 
irreducible antinomy, yet he confesses that their approxi- 
mation may be indefinitely prolonged. He aspires to a 
codperation between natural science and metaphysics, 
but that is as far as he gets. The difficulties of the co- 
operation are too great. These difficulties are brought 
out by one of our compatriots, to whom we may return 
as a final critic of the meaning of this movement. In 
his article on the ‘‘ Emancipation of Intelligence,’’ 
‘Wendell Bush holds that the idea that pragmatism was 
an apology for theism has seriously interfered with the 
profitable discussion of pragmatism itself. The aim of 
pragmatism has been to show that much of the current 
subject-matter in philosophy is thoroughly artificial. 
This does not mean that guiding philosophy has ceased 
to exist, but only that it has changed its name and fled 
into other departments of our universities, where chairs 
are not maintained for either saving the supernatural, 
or threshing the husks of idealism. Under the present 
pragmatic conditions, then, what a catalogue of problems 
disappears! There is that whole list of animistic sur- 
vivals—such as God, the soul, and the universe—con- 
cerning which idealism has given certain assurances. 
But these are merely imaginary problems, bound to dis- 
appear just as other imaginary problems have disap- 
peared. The work of the past generation is now hearing
-P-A-G-E-348
340 PRAGMATISM 
  fruit. Darwin’s Origin of Species, Tyler’s Primitive 
Culture, Frazer’s Golden Bough have brought about a 
condition of affairs similar to that at the beginnings of 
modern philosophy. Pragmatism is indeed but a new 
name for some old ways of thinking. . . . The thing has 
happened before. Just as the orthodox metaphysicians 
must have thought that Descartes ignored most of the 
important problems, and just as the Cartesians had to 
break away from the metaphysics of the Roman Catholic 
institution, so we have to cut loose from the metaphysics 
of Protestant speculation and from whatever is simply 
incidental to it!

  CHAPTER X 
NOTES ON THE NEW REALISM 
In going from the old to the new realism we leave 
the slow, conservative caravan and forge ahead into the 
twentieth century. It is a leap of nearly two generations 
to catch up with this, the most modern of movements. 
In this long interval much has taken place. In the eyes 
of the present generation transcendentalism with its 
gorgeous coloring has come and gone like autumnal 
foliage. Absolute idealism with its cloud-capped pin- 
nacles has likewise faded away. In their stead has arisen 
prosaic pragmatism, the philosophy of practicality, the 
ereed of the man in the street, a working hypothesis 
which makes truth to be that which succeeds. : 
It is out of this atmosphere of the actual that the 
new plant had sprung; that will be plain later. Now/ 
we must turn back in order to effect a junction betweer. 
the two allied forces. It is safe to say that the new real- 
ism is a movement purged of the faults of the old and in- 
vigorated by the struggle with its rivals. Because of its 
undisputed sway, the old grew dogmatic, then weak and 
senile, but the new has been strengthened by a struggle 
with powerful rivals. Between the old and the new 
realism lay the tortuous road of various idealisms; by 
traveling along this road and grappling with these giants 
the youngest of the philosophies has gained its vigor. 
The story of the rise of neo-realism is interesting. Its 
prophet was Frederick Woodbridge, who in his presiden- 
tial address before the Western Philosophical Associa- 
341 
 
-P-A-G-E-350
  342 NOTES ON THE NEW REALISM 
tion suggested some of the lessons to be learned from the 
historical method of handling the problem of meta- 
physics. Such was the futility of the distinction be- 
tween appearance and reality; the necessity of an inde- 
pendent metaphysics; the need of a logic of definition. 
. . . This was in 1903. Six years later, at the New Haven 
meeting of the American Philosophical Association, six 
of the younger members happened to find themselves in 
agreement on certain points raised in the daily discus- 
sion. Five of them represented the old colonial founda- 
tions, from Harvard southward to Princeton. They 
were familiar with the former traditions of the Atlantic 
seaboard, but with these traditions they found they were 
out of sympathy. The abstract, the a priori, from Kant 
to Lotze, had been dinned into their ears until they 
longed for a change in the tune. They decided to change 
it for themselves.,, The first task was to get rid of the 
everlasting epistemology, the constant resolving of all 
problems into the problem of knowledge. How do I 
know? What do I know? Do I really know?—such 
questions had resulted in sterile quibbles, and yet all this 
time the scientists, whether sociologists, psychologists, or 
biologists, were digging up rich raw material with no- 
body to turn it into the finished philosophical product. 
The richness of reality, direct awareness of the world 
—these are the prime marks of the new philosophy. In- 
stead of thin abstraction, our eyes—if we will only look 
—may see a thick crust of facts, constantly growing 
thicker. Science, law, politics, religion—these are the 
rivers which are bringing down the rich alluvial de- 
posits. The absolutists, the high idealists, directed our 
gaze to the mountain peaks; but those arid regions of 
pure abstraction are to us, they say, not half so worth-

valleys of decision where problems must be solved, prob- 
lems of actual life. Let us, therefore, cut up this land, 
pick out our patches, and cultivate our own gardens. 
As is natural with any fresh movement, the new real- 
ism declares itself against tradition. Like the very tran- 
scendentalism against which it is a protest, it starts with 
a polemic. But the protest and the polemic are not 
expressed in a tone of irritation. A marked excellence 
of the school is its very knowledge of the schools. It 
has now reached a class-consciousness and seeks to relate 
itself to other forms of thought. The relation of the 
new realism to Kant is best seen in its attitude towards 
the philosophers after Kant. With them it abandons 
the thing-in-itself. But there the agreement stops. Let 
us put the matter in this way. There are certain castles 
on the Rhine which the Hegelians built and from which 
they looked down as overlords over the valley of reality. 
With the legislative powers conferred by Kant some of 
them went so far as to view consciousness as the source 
not only of the a priori forms of relations, but of all 
relations whatsoever. This overlordship was carried even 
further. The little lords were swallowed up in a su- 
preme lord. The result was that our various empirical 
selves and the objects of their experience were all re- 
garded as the manifestations or fragments of a single, 
perfect, all-inclusive, and eternal self. 
Idealistic absolutism! The successors of the cautious 
philosopher of Koenigsberg talk at times as if they had 
come into possession of a Holy Roman Empire. But 
the road which leads to Rome splits into two. From 
absolutism there arises the dilemma of dualism, a new 
dualism of the finite and absolute. Hither the experi- 
ence of the fragment embraces the experience of the 
absolute or it does not. If the former, then the abso-
-P-A-G-E-352
344 NOTES ON THE NEW REALISM 
lute becomes knowable only at the cost of losing its 
absoluteness and being reduced to a mere “‘ state ’’ of 
the alleged fragment. The existence of the absolute will 
then be known by its own fragments and each frag- 
mentary self will have to assume that its own experience 
constitutes the entire universe. This is solipsism or 
subjectivism. If the other horn of the dilemma be 
chosen and the independent reality of the absolute be 
insisted upon, then it is at the cost of making the abso- 
lute unknowable. This is agnosticism or phenomenalism. 
The road has ended, but only in two blind alleys— 
solipsism and agnosticism. And now enter upon this 
troubled scene the new realists, offering ways of escape. 
The escape from solipsism is to go back to that pri- 
mordial common sense which believes in a world that 
exists independently of the knowing of it. The escape 
from agnosticism is to believe that that same independ- 
ent world can be directly presented in consciousness and 
not merely represented or copied by ‘‘ ideas.’’ 
The impression gained from this general confession 
of the realistic faith is one of healthy objectivism. The 
younger realists look upon the world with no jaundiced 
eye of solipsism. 'To them the world is no eject of 
the subject, no piece of human imagery, but its texture is 
made of other stuff than mere thought. It is this that 
leads to a new proclamation of emancipation. The 
emancipation of metaphysics from epistemology is neces- 
sary because of the latter’s dogmatic claims. The a 
priori philosopher who made metaphysics to be the sci- 
ence of the possibility of knowledge has considered that 
he alone can spy out the promised land. The truth of 
the matter is that there are things not dreamt of in his 
philosophy—all the startling discoveries and inventions 
of the modern age from wireless telegraphy to X-ray
-P-A-G-E-353

photography. Indeed there is no discipline that can lay 
down for all time to come the main outlines of the world 
as the possible object of scientific research. Even logical 
propositions do not come into being or get created by 
the student that first learns that they are true. They 
are discovered and not made, as truly as was the Ameri- 
can continent discovered and not made by the explorers 
of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Furthermore, 
by its very claims to certainty epistemology has betrayed 
its limitations. It has sought a kind of metaphysical 
trust which maps out the territory and will brook no 
rivals. 
Now, under the new régime, continues Marvin, the 
a priori must give way to the a posteriori, preconception 
to conception, as the ultimate crucial test. Indeed it is 
asserted that not only is the theory of knowledge sub- 
sequent to logic, but it is subsequent also to some of the 
special sciences, such as physics and biology. As to what 
knowledge is possible man has never succeeded in getting 
trustworthy information except empirically. In case 
after case man has been able to discover what scholars 
in another age pronounced unknowable. We have been 
able to study the chemistry and temperature of the 
stars, we can weigh the planets, we can tell with com- 
plete accuracy the area of curved figures whose sides 
stretch out to infinity. The place, then, of the science 
of knowledge among the other sciences is humble. It is 
not the head of the hierarchy, inasmuch as it does not 
give, but presupposes, the theory of knowledge. The 
weakness of that discipline is that in claiming to be both 
the beginning and the end of the various forms of knowl- 
edge it works in a vicious circle. Instead of being funda- 
mental it is in many cases superficial, being saturated 
with the scientific prejudices of the day and generation

of its author. Thus there is good reason to believe that 
the great Kant himself could not escape the Newtonian 
conception in drawing many of his conclusions. In 
short, it is impossible for the a priori philosopher to jump 
out of his environment and vain for him to write pro- 
legomena to any future metaphysic. Aw 
The author here compares the old epistemology to a 
‘* salted ’’? mine in which the most valued ore has been 
put not by nature, but by human hands. But such a 
hardened ‘‘ promoter ’’ will continue to promote in- 
tellectual distrust so long as he tries to tease out a 
world hypothesis by dialectic rather than to devote him- 
self to a modest, open-minded, and industrious study of 
the cognitive facts. So the old-fashioned rationalist 
must give way to the neo-realist, for no careful philoso- 
pher would offer mankind to-day the amount of a priori 
information Kant claimed to derive by means of his 
transcendentalism. And yet we are learning much from 
the sciences to-day regarding subjects that were once 
merely presumptive knowledge—the nature of the 
heavenly world, the nature of matter, the nature of life, 
and the nature of mind. 
We can put this in another way. Appeal to the prag- 
matic test, the verdict of history, and ask to what dis- 
coveries or doctrines of the past two hundred years is 
our present-day metaphysics especially indebted, to 
epistemology or to the progress of the natural sciences? 
We can go even further, take one of the oldest of the 
metaphysical problems, the nature of matter. In the last 
few years we seem to be learning more concerning the 
make-up of matter than man succeeded in discovering 
in the preceding two thousand years. Even such a hoary 
conviction as that mass is an absolute constant is now 
contradicted. What could be more startling than to be

told that electricity is an all but fundamental concept in 
the new philosophy of nature? A thousand years of 
transcendentalism or of any other theory as to what mat- 
ter must be, in order to be a possible experience, could 
not have revealed to us such truths. For these reasons 
we claim that metaphysics should be emancipated from 
epistemology, for the growth of science can again revo- 
lutionize metaphysical sciences as it did in the days of 
Galileo. 
Marvin’s emancipation of metaphysics from epistemol- 
ogy is a negative or rather a privative aspect of the new 
realist. A positive defense is offered in Perry’s theory 
of independence. In emphasizing their emancipation the 
new thinkers declare themselves freed from their previ- 
ous condition of servitude to the old idealism. Moreover, 
in making a declaration of independence they draw up 
a bill of particulars against that despot, the Absolute. 
No longer do they look to an all-knower, an universal 
consciousness in order to learn what to do. They do 
not even make an humble remonstrance, but boldly de- 
clare that both the absolute consciousness and the indi- 
vidual consciousness are unnecessary for the fact of exist- 
ence. Things are independent of being known. Whether 
as a matter of fact they are known or unknown, the rela- 
tion of awareness is merely accidental ; it is not essential. 
Spaulding next takes up analysis as the discovery in 
a whole of elements or parts which exist independently 
of the analysis and discovery. This is not the prag- 
matic analysis which is simply an intellectual instru- 
ment, a mode of adaptation, with an emphasis on the 
humanistic interpretation and its tendency towards sub- 
jective idealism. Nor is it the analysis of the type of 
Bergson, who arrives at the position that everything is 
change, flux, evolution, with such an interpenetration  
-P-A-G-E-356
  348 NOTES ON THE NEW REALISM 
of parts that there are no lines of separation, but only 
one great viscous or mobile fluid, the whole being a con- 
tinuous, flowing, trembling jelly. Such a view, with its 
tendency toward monism, serves to make analysis iden- 
tical with falsification, for such analysis would make 
the finding, or inventing, or constructing of the parts to 
be in contradiction of the whole. For Bergson anything 
short of one all-inclusive, interpenetrated, evolving whole 
is contradictory and so false and not real. The creative 
evolutionist has proceeded on the view that analysis is 
destructive, that to articulate the skeleton is to kill the 
animal. But the neo-realist holds that such is not neces- 
sarily the case, since the actual world of physical, chem- 
ical, and physiological facts is discontinuous at certain 
points. It may be that one kind of experience finds, in a 
given situation, that the body, the time, and the posi- 
tions, are fused and interpenetrated so as to form one 
whole. But this kinetoscopic view of reality which makes 
every entity analyzed to be continuous, is not the only 
view. There is the whole atomic world in which analysis 
reveals many separate existential facts. Yet this division 
into parts does not mean a wild discreteness. Certain 
substances combine in more than one proportion, and 
these proportions are rational. Furthermore, at the 
present stage in the development of science, molecules, 
atoms, electrons, and the relations between them, must 
be accepted, as existing in quite the same sense as do the 
entities which they explain. 
As Perry’s theory of independence led to Spaulding’s 
defense and analysis, so the two combined fit into Mon- 
tague’s relational theory of consciousness, a theory 
worked out several years prior to its appearance here. 
Objects as independent need no consciousness for their 
existence. Yet objects as analyzed disclose a network of 
 
-P-A-G-E-357
SE ELS CE ne ee eT Te ee ae 
NOTES ON THE NEW REALISM 349 
relationships between objects and the subject consider- 
ing them. This suggests an hypothesis which avoids the 
crudities of naive realism and escapes the difficulties 
of subjective idealism. The fact of error is the crucial 
test in all these theories. The old realism was weak 
because it could not account for such vagaries as the 
events of a dream. The common-sense theory held to 
a world of objects and consciousness like a searchlight 
playing upon those objects; not creating them, but sim- 
ply revealing them. But dreams demolished this theory, 
for it could give no account of events outside of a world 
of beings interacting in space and time. So the pen- 
dulum swung to the other extreme of subjectivism ac- 
cording to which the world in which we live is conceived 
as a product, fashioned by consciousness from the raw 
materials of its own states. The searchlight becomes 
a projecting camera, consciousness being a creative 
cause of that which it beholds or is pleased to 
behold. 
At this point arises the need of a corrective and sup- 
plementary hypothesis. The old realism emphasized ob- 
jective truths and suppressed subjective errors. The 
old idealism found it hard to distinguish between truth 
and error. The world of the romantic idealist, for all 
his fine words, remains but a world of shadow pictures 
on the screen of consciousness. The true and the false, 
what are they? To the neo-realist they are respectively 
the real and the unreal considered as objects of a pos- ' 
sible belief or judgment. There is, that is to say, the 
same difference between what is real and what is true, 
as between George Washington and President George 
Washington. President George Washington refers to 
Washington in a certain relation to our government. 
George Washington denotes precisely the same indi-

vidual without calling attention to the presidential rela- 
tion. 
This is the first example given in the relational theory 
of consciousness. It does not concern itself with mere 
objects or mere subjects, but with what are usually 
called existential propositions. To it the real universe 
consists of the space-time system of existents, together 
with all that is presupposed by that system. Examples 
of such relations and propositions are such as these: 
Cesar lived before Napoleon; orange resembles yellow 
more than green. All this may seem commonplace and 
obvious. But a distinction is to be made, a distinction 
which will clear up the confusion between truth and 
falsity. Truth and falsity never attach to judgments 
as acts, but to propositions as objects. There would be 
no sense in calling an act of belief as such either true or 
false. If we wished to know whether certain beliefs that 
we held about the properties of triangles were true or 
false, whom should we consult? The psychologist? 
Certainly not. We should go to the mathematician. 
But why? The psychologist is supposed to be an expert 
on mental processes, and if the adjectives true and false 
were to apply to beliefs as mental processes, he would 
be the one to settle our difficulties. We should go to the 
mathematician, however, because our desire to know 
whether our beliefs about triangles were true or false 
could be satisfied only by one who knew about triangles. 
So with all cases of doubt as to truth and falsity, we 
go to the person who knows about the things believed 
rather than to him who knows about the processes or 
acts of believing. 
In connection with the subject of error and as the 
result of his varied psychological experiments, Edwin 
Holt seeks to find the place of illusion in a realistic 
 
-P-A-G-E-359
  NOTES ON THE NEW REALISM 351 
world. Illusion, hallucination, and erroneous experience 
in general, we are told, can have no place in a universe 
where everything is non-mental or real; and they cannot 
be satisfactorily accounted for by a realistic philosophy. 
This is the challenge throughout from the idealist to the 
realist camp. It has to be met not by a general denial, 
but by specific analysis. First come errors of space. 
For example, the person squinting his eyes sees double, 
that is, what is not there; hence, reasons the idealist, the 
illusory object is essentially mental and subjective. 
Nothing of the sort, responds the realist, it is only a case 
of mechanical manipulation of the eyes. The stereo- 
scopic camera also sees double. So with the case of 
errors of time. The idealists’ hallowed illustration of 
seeing some distant star some millions of years behind 
time, or millions of years after it may be said to exist, 
does not make the image merely mental. The camera 
does the same thing; every image there lags in strikingly 
the same way behind its real physical prototype. The 
case of seeing the known existing sun does not raise the 
issue between reality and unreality, or between the 
material and the mental, nor does the case of secondary 
qualities. The colors of the landscape may change, yet 
the chemical properties of the hill and wood that one 
looks out upon, are practically invariable in their chemi- 
eal properties. Luminous properties may change, but 
this is due to the incident illumination which brings 
the perpetual variety of light, shade, and hue. The 
orthochromatic moving film will record this diurnal 
flux in an entirely parallel way. In short, we may 
overthrow the idealist’s contention as to a remarkable 
ereative function inherent in mental processes, by 
pointing out parallel phenomena in the material world. 
The last of the chapters of the composite work on new
-P-A-G-E-360
  352 NOTES ON THE NEW REALISM 
realism is remarkable in disclosing a sort of civil war, 
an internecine struggle between the scientists themselves. 
The strongest influences against realism to-day, says Pit- 
kin, emanate from the biological sciences. Only a few 
years ago it was physics and mathematics which made 
the natural world-view seem untenable; and before them 
it was logic and psychology. But from a new quarter 
there rises a host of adversaries, declaring that the un- 
answerable disproof of realism is found in simple life 
processes. Driesch is the modern leader of this move- 
ment in his systematic attempt to establish idealistic 
vitalism on biological evidences. So, too, Bergson pro- 
ceeds from psychology to biology. The immediate data 
of consciousness afford a new basis for interpreting life 
processes, for the latter reveal a cosmos not composed 
of distinct characters, but a flux wherein everything in- 
terpenetrates everything else. All distinctions are 
products of a ‘‘ vital force ’’ and serve only for organic 
controls. Driesch concludes that the entire content of 
experience is created by the ego, in the same manner as 
Kant held; Bergson that there is an objective flux that 
constitutes the environment of the vital force. | 
Against the vitalism of the German and the creative 
evolution of the Frenchman, Pitkin holds that recon- 
struction must begin. Both systems contain the old, dis- 
credited categories of idealistic psychology. The former 
reverts to the ancient Aristotelian entelechy, or internal 
perfecting principle; the latter maintains that knowl- 
edge can never give us the ‘‘ real thing,’’ inasmuch as 
it gives us only a few of its selected characters. Hence 
there is need of a formal analysis of the biological situa- 
tion, an analysis free of the faults of hunting for an 
unknown something behind the organism, or of making 
the environment a hazy entity. Therefore naturally in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-361
  
NOTES ON THE NEW REALISM 353 
specting animals and their circumstances of life we 
find :—that they exist in a world larger than themselves ; 
that this world sets for them certain difficulties; that 
some individuals overcome these difficulties; that those 
which signally overcome the difficulties differ, in some 
observable respects, from those which do not. 
We have here the two familiar evolutionary factors— 
organism and environment. Shall we call one sub- 
jective, the other objective, and draw a line of division 
between the two? The realist replies—No! The reac- 
tion of the organism and the stimulus of environment 
are simply two phases of one unitary process, as are the 
two poles of a magnet. Just as the positive pole does not 
take something from nor add something to the negative 
pole, so the reaction does not consist in selecting some- 
thing from the stimulus or adding to it. Each gets its 
character from its relation to the other. Both the struc- 
ture and function of an organ vary with some variations 
in the external stimulus, but this variation should not be 
called a qualitative transformation. There is merely a 
change from behavior of one character to behavior of 
another character. For instance, a dog is frequently 
docile when at large and vicious only when tethered. 
Would anybody say, though, that in turning the dog 
loose we change his quality? Hardly: for the new cir- 
cumstances bring the dog into new relations; and it is in 
response to the latter that it now behaves differently. 
Now, are these new relations real, in the objective sense, 
or merely creations of the mind? Are we to dig a colos- 
sal chasm between phenomenal and noumenal, between 
things as thought and things in themselves, to explain 
such behavior? The task is unnecessary. When ani- 
mals, including man, adjust themselves to their environ- 
ments, it is because there are resistances and positions 
 
-P-A-G-E-362
  354 NOTES ON THE NEW REALISM | 
of which they must take account. Every living creature 
finds itself in a world full of things distant from it and 
from one another in space and in time. Some of these 
things it seeks, others it shuns; and the precise rela- 
tion of particular things to its body in space and in time 
is a life-or-death matter. We conclude, therefore, that 
geometrical, mathematical, and other relations are genu- 
ine stimuli in the very sense that material complexes 
are. They are not products of the cognitive reaction 
but the producers of it. 
Such is radical realism, a system hardly held before 
save by Aristotle and the materialists. Pitkin con- 
fesses that he is quite aware that in asserting planes, 
angles, numbers, ratios, to be stimuli in precisely the 
same sense that the ether waves are, he is exposing him- 
self to ridicule. But suppose we take an alternative 
hypothesis and, with nearly everybody except the new 
realists, describe the mathematical-geometrical relations 
as ‘‘ intellectual abstractions,’’ ‘‘ constructs,’’ ‘‘ short- 
hand expressions,’’ what does that lead to? To the old 
idealism which, starting with space and time as erea- 
tions of the mind, subjective principles, led on to para- 
doxes which can be solved only by pronouncing the whole 
situation ‘‘ unreal.’? Of course there are certain ad- 
vantages in this parallelistic hypothesis which puts a 
phenomenal world alongside a noumenal. It avoids the 
ego-centric predicament which holds that a tree may seem 
to be unmodified by being perceived; but that is only 
because I know not all that is happening to it. Con- 
trariwise it accepts certain processes as not being con- 
stituted by the cognitive process but as merely running 
alongside that process. Take the adaptation of the flat- 
fish to the sea bottom. We would be setting up a one-to- 
one correspondence between the phenomenal and nou-
-P-A-G-E-363
  
NOTES ON THE NEW REALISM 355 
menal orders if we were to declare that each discernible 
peuliarity in the fish’s adaptive reaction resulted from 
some peculiarity in its noumenal environment. That is, 
when the flatfish, having a certain blue-gray checker 
pattern on its back as a consequence of resting upon a 
blue-gray checker sea bottom, shifts to a gray-brown sea 
bottom of irregular design and there soon develops on 
its back a gray-brown pattern of irregular design, the 
difference between the former and the latter noumenal 
situation is of the same type as that between the blue- 
gray checker and the irregular gray-brown pattern of 
the sea bottom. Nevertheless, the noumenal difference is 
not a difference between colors and space forms, for 
these are only phenomenal. Now, according to the 
idealistic biology, you may take any case of reaction 
and describe it in this manner. With Driesch you may 
say that space is phenomenal, that is, a form of experi- 
ence, and not a form of the physical world independent 
of experience. With Bergson you may say that mathe- 
matical-geometrical characters are static artifacts created 
by the vital force. The scheme is plausible but it has 
its difficulties. Chief of these is the identity of indis- 
eernibles. If there be a one-to-one correspondence there 
is no means of distinguishing the noumenal order from 
the phenomenal. The old epistemology made two sys- 
tems. The new biology of animal behavior cannot dis- 
tinguish the two systems. On the contrary it identifies 
the pair, reduces it to a single system. In fine, the sup- 
position that there is a system beyond that which we 
perceive is gratuitous. There are no phenomena and 
no noumena, but only things, events, conditions, cir- 
cumstances—all in a universe which no mind has split 
into two realms. 
From this reduction of the old dualism there arises a  
-P-A-G-E-364
  356 NOTES ON THE NEW REALISM 
sense of relief. The uncomfortable sense of a double- 
dealing world is made to disappear. No longer have we 
one leg on the noumenal and the other on the prenomenal, 
but both are planted in reality. No longer is the knower 
a twofold being,—in one aspect transcendental, in an- 
other empirical. The advantage of this view to epis- 
temology is patent. For example, in accepting the full 
reality of space, it does away with the supposed para- 
doxes of distance from Zeno to Bergson. It also does 
away with the difficulties of considering space as either 
an idea or a mere form of apprehension. But besides 
seeking the facts of geometry in the world order the 
author might have gone further and applied his reason- 
ings to ethics. There stands that irritating neo-Hegelian 
doctrine of conduct. To say, as do Royce and Miinster- 
berg, that we are bound in the sphere of the phenomenal, 
but free in the noumenal, is to make us neither bond nor 
free, but morally paralyzed because pulled in two direc- 
tions at once. Now by doing away with these two worlds 
the sense of freedom is restored and this is a second 
advantage of the new realism. 
A third advantage is the possibility of making modern 
philosophy less anthropocentric. It appears that a 
new Galileo is needed formally to analyze the broader 
features of the world in which the individual organism 
exists. Now, according to the new realism and in de- 
cided contrast to the old realism, introspection is not 
fundamental. Outward reality is far richer than inward. 
meditation. All that consciousness does is to pick out 
one strand of the complex cosmic net. In a word, 
thought is not creative but selective, and at times even 
negative in its results. As Pitkin summarizes it, thought 
is only one phase in the much more comprehensive or- 
ganic process, and presumably bears pretty much the
-P-A-G-E-365
  NOTES ON THE NEW REALISM 357 
same relation to this latter that the cross-sectional mo- 
tions in some one plane of chemism bear to the total 
chemism. Suppose one might peer into a constellation 
of corpuscles with a microscope of transcendent power. 
One would there see, from any one given point of view, 
a vast tangle of motions, and yet discover nothing that 
would betray the peculiar character of the chemism; for 
all the motions that were significant might occur in 
planes parallel to the observer’s line of vision, and their 
bearings might furthermore lie wholly beyond the micro- 
scopic field. 
A sense of relief, a feeling of freedom, an impression 
of reserve,—these are three valuable qualities of the 
new realism. With them go corresponding difficulties. 
It is easy to demolish the high towers of the ambitious 
idealist, in so far as they are projections of the pure in- 
tellect. It is not so easy to bring that intellect down to 
the level of mere experience. Cognition may not be 
creative, yet is it only one of the bodily activities? Can 
we reduce its activities to the same order as the extra- 
cognitive conditions, such as blood temperature, conduc- 
tion currents, colloids, and all the host of material fac- 
tors which never figure discretely in the natural opera- 
tions of cognizing the environment and reacting to 
it? In raising these questions the writer appears to favor 
an affirmative answer. He goes further and says that 
the organism in ‘‘ mental activity ’’ throws selected 
objects upon the cognitive field no less physically than 
it throws them upon the retinas. Moreover, ‘‘ attend- 
ing ’’ is defined as a stretching out toward something; 
not a feeling nor a knowing nor a thinking, but a going 
to meet or to find some environmental character. Indeed, 
the author adds, it would conduce to clarity both in 
biology and psychology, if attention were admitted to be    
-P-A-G-E-366
  358 NOTES ON THE NEW REALISM 
a general organic attitude and not a specialized func- 
tion like cognizing. We might then speak of the 
phagocytes as attending to bacteria without our on 
into grotesque panpsychism or idealism. 
Pitkin further supposes that what a man does is not 
determined primarily by something which philosophers 
call vital force, psychoid, or ego, but that behaviors and 
attitudes may be assumed by the blood, or by some group 
of cortical cells. Now, if the realistic biologist has 
escaped idealism by this supposition, has he not fallen 
into materialism? He admits his wish to escape the 
suspicion of subjectivism, but has he not committed the 
equal crime of rank objectivism—reduced the psychic to 
the merely physical? The question is hypothetical and 
so is the answer. If we agree to define the physical 
world as the spatio-temporal system exclusively, then 
consciousness is not physical, for the projection field, or 
the field of consciousness, is, in the strict logical sense 
of the adjective, transverse to the objects projected upon 
it. But though consciousness be not physical this does 
not imply that the objects of consciousness are not physi- 
cal. Nor does it even imply that cognitive relations are 
not relations between physical things. 
This conclusion seems commonplace, a return to the 
old-fashioned realism where common sense saw in the 
world merely minds and bodies and the relations between 
those bodies. And yet this is not a complete statement 
of the content of the new realism. Since the day of 
Reid and Beattie there has been an immense enrichment 
of the world both on the subjective and objective sides. 
Consciousness, contends the biologist, as soon as it is in- 
vestigated, appears as a feature of a ‘‘ big situation.’’ 
This situation involves not only feeling and thinking, but 
also the organism,—blood and sinew and nerves and 
 
-P-A-G-E-367
NOTES ON THE NEW REALISM 359 
impulses and appetites,—and finally physical things,— 
electricity, light, matter. This is the final word of the 
last of the new realists. It is indeed a ‘‘ big situation,”’ 
containing a host of entities which are, at present, 
projectively indiscernible, because we do not possess all 
the possible angles of vision. How many such projective 
constants there are nobody knows, but geometry, physics, 
and psychology bring forward facts indicating that the 
variety of types is exceedingly great. 
‘We leave the new realism in this its hopeful state. Its 
motto might be this: New worlds for old. In place of 
a disheartening idealism, which makes things in them- 
selves undiscoverable, unless by the aid of an Absolute, 
it puts a world of actuality. In place of those specu- 
lative mountain peaks covered with the fogs of the 
phenomenal it points to valleys of decision whose soil 
is deep and whose crops are rich.

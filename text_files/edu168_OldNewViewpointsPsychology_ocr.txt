PREFACE 
The present volume contains three public lec- 
tures delivered at the Johns Hopkins University, 
and two papers read before the Southern Society 
for Philosophy and Psychology. The lectures on 
Mental Measurements and on Present Day Schools 
of Psychology were delivered under the auspices of 
the University on May 10 and May 17, 1923, respec- 
tively. The lecture on The Psychology of the 
Comic was delivered under the auspices of the 
Johns Hopkins’ Women’s Club on May 31, 1921. 
The paper on Psychological Aspects of Spiritual- 
ism was read at Macon, March 25, 1921. The paper 
on The Reading of Character from External Signs 
was read at Memphis, April 15, 1922, and is re- 
printed, by permission, from the Scientific Monthly 
for August 1922. 
The lecture on mental measurements was pre- 
pared with the cooperation of Dr. Buford Johnson 
and Mr. Schachne Isaaes of the staff of the Depart- 
ment of Psychology of Johns Hopkins, and 
represents, therefore, a departmental viewpoint 
instead of merely my own personal opinions. We 
believe that the points made in this lecture are of 
great importance at the present time, and that they 
should be carefully considered by every psycholo-

CHAPTER I 
MENTAL MEASUREMENTS 
The field of psychological work at the present 
time is covered by two overlapping topics which, 
for want of more appropriate terms are commonly 
called general psychology and individual psychol- 
ogy. General psychology, as its name indicates, is 
the attempt to discover the general facts and laws 
of mind. If, for example, we are interested in the 
effects of smoking tobacco, and if in the course of 
investigation into these effects we should discover 
that so far as the flow of ideas is concerned, the 
effect of smoking is to accelerate this flow, to make 
a man ‘‘think’’ faster; and that the exceptional 
cases which may occur are due to other assignable 
causes, working concurrently, and modifying the 
general tobacco effect: if, I say, we should find 
such a result, we would be working in general psy- 
chology, and our conclusion would be an addition to 
that field. If, further, we should investigate the 
difference in the effects of cigar, cigarette, and pipe 
smoking; or the effects of smoking while learning 
something new, as compared with the effects of 
smoking while carrying on perfectly familiar men- 
tal processes, we should still be working in general 
psychology. 
cet

On the other hand, suppose we find that certain 
mental operations are more strikingly affected in 
some smokers than in others, and that it is impor- 
tant in a number of cases to discover just how 
large, relatively, the effect is, in order that these 
men may be advised towards or against smoking. 
We are interested here primarily in the differences 
which individuals show, rather than in the common 
or general factors, and hence this type of investiga- 
tion is classed as differential psychology, or indi- 
vidual psychology. 
By common consent, experimental work on the 
problems of general psychology has come to be 
known as experimental psychology. This has hap- 
pened because experimental work began in this field 
prior to the systematic development of individual 
psychology. Experimental research in individual 
psychology had therefore to be given another name, 
and is commonly included along with the routine 
application of measures under the term mental 
measurement. ‘‘Mental measurement,”’’ then, is the 
term covering, first, the work of devising or creat- 
ing ‘‘tests’’ of mental capacity or facility, which 
shall be capable of differentiating individuals in a 
useful way; second, the standardizing of such tests ; 
and third, the practical work of applying the tests 
and evaluating the results. 
The difference between Experimental and Indi- 
vidual Psychology is, however, not in purposes
-P-A-G-E-11
MENTAL MEASUREMENTS 13 
only, but involves important differences in methods 
of work, which I hope to bring out in the course of 
this discussion. 
There are, however, several further points which 
must be understood before we are in a position to 
discuss the subject effectively. 
In the first place, it must be understood that ex- 
perimental psychology and mental measurements 
cannot be entirely separated. Although the experi- 
mental psychologist is interested in the general 
facts and laws of mind, he arrives at these only by 
taking into account the individual differences. In 
searching for the most general laws of learning, 
for example, the research is conducted on individ- 
uals; and the general laws cannot be determined 
without due consideration of the individual differ- 
ences. On the other hand, the construction of a 
mental test which shall have any practical value 
depends upon the accomplishment of a vast amount 
of really experimental work, in which general prin- 
ciples as well as individual differences are deter- 
mined. Individual differences in memory, for ex- 
ample, may be determined; but they are of no 
value unless we know what the standards of mem- 
ory for that particular form of test are, and also, 
what the importance, for the general mental life, of 
that particular type of memory is. And these facts 
must be experimentally determined. 
I emphasize this point because there has been an
-P-A-G-E-12
14 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
unfortunate tendency among some of the workers 
in mental measurements to ignore experimental 
psychology. We have had the deplorable spectacle 
of persons knowing little of the field of general psy- 
chology, and entirely unfamiliar with the technique 
of psychological experimentation, attempting to 
construct ‘‘tests’’ and interpret their results. Of 
late, this deficiency has even been openly admitted 
in some quarters and made a matter of pride. <Ac- 
ceptance of the theory called ‘‘behaviorism’’ seems 
to relieve some mental testers of all experimental 
responsibility. ‘‘I am getting objective results,’’ 
one prolific constructor of tests recently told me, in 
reply to my question as to the significance of rat- 
ings obtained by the use of a certain test of his. 
“‘T can test a thousand children,’’ he went on to 
say, ‘‘and establish norms, and obtain the deviation 
of any individual from the norm. These are objec- 
tive results, and I am not interested in theoretical 
questions of meaning.’’ I mention this case be- 
cause it is one which most strikingly illustrates the 
fact that divorcing mental measurements from ex- 
perimental psychology reduces the measurements 
either to triviality or to absurdity. 
I think the greatest practical difficulty the psy- 
chologist encounters, which is little appreciated 
outside the profession, is the enormous range of the 
field in which he labors. Leaving out of account the 
special psychologies such as the psychology of
-P-A-G-E-13
  
MENTAL MEASUREMENTS 15 
childhood, abnormal psychology, animal psychol- 
ogy, ete., the differentiation of mental measure- 
ment from experimental psychology resembles in 
degree the differentiation of physics and chem- 
istry; and no one man can now cover expertly any 
large part of the total field of psychology. Never- 
theless, no one can be reasonably expert in either 
of these fields without some considerable acquaint- 
ance with the other, and the demands now made on 
a candidate for the degree of doctor of philosophy 
in psychology, whether he be specializing in general 
or individual psychology, are quite comparable, in 
respect to psychology alone, to those made on the 
student of physics, who is required also to have a 
certain knowledge of chemistry and mathematics. 
In the second place, we need to consider the his- 
torical development of individual psychology in 
order to understand its aims and present status. 
Tendencies towards the differentiation of individ- 
ual psychology from general psychology may be 
discerned in the early days of experimental psychol- 
ogy, but most of these early tendencies were not 
clearly recognized even by those who brought them 
forward, and they did not eventuate usefully. The 
actual beginnings of the present development were 
made by Binet in France, and Ebbinghaus in Ger- 
many, and in both cases were attempts at the men- 
tal measurement of children. The work in Ger- 
many was continued by Stern and others; but al-  
-P-A-G-E-14
  16 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
though Ebbinghaus’ contributions were of great 
importance, the progress of mental measurements 
was in still greater degree stimulated by the work 
of Binet and his coadjutor Simon. The impetus 
towards mental measurements in America came 
primarily through Goddard, Huey, and Kuhlman, 
all of whom were principally interested in the 
measurement of mental deficiency, especially the 
mental defects of children. Both Goddard and 
Huey worked with Binet and Simon at the Sor- 
bonne, and each, on returning to America, con- 
structed a version, or ‘‘revision,’’ of the Binet- 
Simon Scale for measuring ‘‘intelligence,’’ in 
which the attempt was made to adapt the Binet- 
Simon tests to the requirements for American chil- 
dren. Goddard introduced the method at the Vine- 
land School for the Feeble-Minded in New Jersey, 
of which he was until recently the head; Huey, 
after his return from France, worked for some time 
in the Phipps Psychiatrie Clinic at Johns Hopkins. 
Kuhlman added to the scale, tests for the child 
from 1 to 3 years of age. The initial interests in 
mental measurements in America was due to these 
men, and their revisions of the Binet-Simon tests 
are still widely used. 
The application of the Binet-Simon tests to nor- 
mal children and to adults was very greatly stimu- 
lated by Yerkes, who, with Bridges and Hardwick 
elaborated a revision of the scale in which a new 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
  
MENTAL MEASUREMENTS 17 
method of scoring was used, under the name of the 
“Point Scale’’; and by Terman and a group of col- 
laborators, who published a revision similar to 
Goddard’s and Huey’s, under the name of the 
“Stanford Revision.’’ The Stanford Revision is 
today the most widely used form of the Binet- 
Simon Seale in America and Great Britain. Simi- 
lar adaptations of the Scale have been made for 
Germany, Scandinavia, Italy, and other countries; 
and not only has the testing of children on this 
basis become very firmly established, but the prac- 
tical success attained in this line of individual psy- 
chology has led in many countries to a very great 
development in measurements applicable to adults 
and children, in connection with problems of edu- 
cation, criminology, abnormal psychology, com- 
merce and industry. 
The Binet-Simon tests belong to the group of 
mental measurements popularly known as ‘‘tests 
of general intelligence,’’ or more briefly, as ‘‘intel- 
ligence tests’’: and intelligence testing is but one 
branch of the extensive range of mental measure- 
ments. But since the vogue of intelligence tests 
has been of very great importance to the develop- 
ment of other lines of mental measurement, and 
since the Binet-Simon tests have been the founda- 
tion of other intelligence tests, not only historically 
but practically, it is worth while to consider the 
characteristics of intelligence tests, and to compare  
-P-A-G-E-16
  18 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
them with experimental measurements previously 
attempted. 
Experimental psychology from the beginning has 
been interested in obtaining general principles, and 
necessarily, therefore, pursued an _ analytical 
method. Relatively simple types of functions, such 
as imagery, reaction-time, and specific types of as- 
sociation in memory, have been brought under ex- 
perimental observation, and an important body of 
knowledge has been attained: important not merely 
to pure science, but important for practical appli- 
cation, even in the field of mental measurements, 
after that field was developed. But these experi- 
mental methods did not, by themselves, yield meas- 
urements of value for individual psychology in its 
practical applications. Both Binet and Ebbinghaus 
at first attempted to apply the analytical methods 
of experimental psychology to the problems of in- 
dividual child psychology, but their attempts were 
failures. And the attempts of many others, both 
before and since, have likewise been failures. 
Let us consider, as an example of the analytical 
measurement, the so-called ‘‘simple reaction-time.’’ 
A man, seated in a comfortable chair before a table, 
listens for the click of a telegraph sounder, or the 
stroke of a bell: as soon as he hears the stimulus, 
he presses a key, or otherwise moves his hand or 
finger in such a way as to make a record of the 
movement. The time between the sound and the
-P-A-G-E-17
  MENTAL MEASUREMENTS 19 
movement may be accurately measured by appro- 
priate apparatus, and is called the ‘‘simple reac- 
tion-time.”’ 
The reaction-time as measured shows character- 
istic variations with practice, with the character of 
the stimulus, with fatigue, and with still other con- 
ditions, and the study of these variations has been 
an important problem of general psychology. But 
the reaction-time varies also from individual to 
individual, and there have been various attempts 
made to use these individual differences for prac- 
tical purposes in mental measurements. During 
the war with Germany, for example, a number of 
workers in England, France, and Italy attempted to 
use the simple reaction-time as a means of selecting 
aviators, although those who were familiar with 
the history of psychology knew well that such at- 
tempts were hopeless. Similar attempts have been 
made in the past to use reaction-times as indices 
of fitness for various lines of industrial work. But 
these attempts have been replaced by measurements 
of complex practical reactions, as similar as pos- 
sible to the operations of real life. For example: 
the simple reactions of an aviator tells us nothing 
of importance: but his ability to manage a compli- 
cated series of discriminating reactions, analogous 
to the operations and discriminations required of 
him in his airplane, does tell us a great deal. 
There are a large number of other simple meas-
-P-A-G-E-18
  20 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
urements on the order of these reaction-times which 
are of great importance in experimental psychol- 
ogy, and through which the problems of general 
psychology are attacked, but so far they have not 
been found useful in mental measurements, and the 
science of mental measurements did not develop 
until the attempt to apply these simple or analytical 
measurements was temporarily abandoned. 
Ebbinghaus and Binet both tried the analytical 
measurements, and then, discarding these, hit upon 
the line of measurement which has made mental 
measurements a success. But it is important to 
note, that although the simple or analytical meas- 
urements of experimental psychology have not been 
utilized in mental measurements, it is highly prob- 
able that they will eventually be made use of, in 
conjunction with the more complex measurements 
in which the foundations have been laid, and there 
is at present a considerable amount of experimental 
effort along this line, which ought to be still fur- 
ther encouraged. 
There are three important characteristics of the 
Binet-Simon tests which made them successful, and 
have set the standards for intelligence tests in gen- 
eral. First, they test complex processes, second, 
they are primarily tests of learning, and third, they 
are largely tests of language function. Binet fixed 
upon certain things which the average child will 
have learned to do at certain ages, and devised sim-
-P-A-G-E-19
  MENTAL MEASUREMENTS 21 
ple tests to determine whether the child had or had 
not learned these. For example, the child at three 
years can be expected to have learned to point to 
his nose, eyes, mouth, and hair, when these are 
named. He should know his own name; he should 
be able parrot-like to repeat short sentences; and 
soon. At four years, he will normally have learned 
to compare lines of unequal length, and to recog- 
nize and name certain common objects like pennies, 
keys, knives. In succeeding years he will have 
learned more complicated operations of counting, 
comparing weights, recognizing absurdities in 
statements, working puzzles, and so on. It will be 
noted that these tests may be called ‘‘simple,’’ but 
the functions tested are by no means simple. : 
Binet’s procedure was a bold flying in the face 
of precedent, and to many who are unacquainted 
with the intricacies of mental measurements, the 
tests still seem arbitrary and trivial. In reality 
they are a beautiful exemplification of strict scien- 
tific method. We want to know the grade of the 
child’s intelligence; that is, his capacity to learn: 
his capacity to acquire the knowledge and habits 
which school and life demand of him. Hence, we 
measure his actual achievements in learning, and 
compare them with the norms carefully obtained 
from a large number of children. The most im- 
portant aspects of learning, for general purposes, 
are connected with language ; hence we pay especial  
-P-A-G-E-20
  22 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
attention to his linguistic achievements. The 
Binet-Simon tests are by no means tests of lan- 
guage simply, nor of general linguistic facility. 
The moron may have a considerable fluency of lan- 
guage, but he does not pass the Binet-Simon test. 
The test depends on very specific practical applica- 
tions of language, which determine the efficiency of 
the normal individual’s judgment and thinking. It 
is because of those features of the Binet-Simon tests 
that they have been successful, and have served as 
models for intelligence tests for adults. They pro- 
ceed directly towards their goal, measuring, with- 
out analysis, the very thing for the estimate of 
which the measurements are desired. It has been 
rashly said by some enthusiasts that intelligence 
tests measure ‘‘natural capacity’’ and not ‘‘acquisi- 
tion.’’ This is, of course, the exact reverse of the 
truth. The Binet-Simon tests, and the typical adult 
intelligence tests of today, measure acquisition al- 
most exclusively; and from the measure of what the 
individual has actually acquired, we then estimate 
his capacity to acquire. The procedure, in other 
words, is strictly inductive: the individual is a 
moving body, and by plotting the course he has 
passed over, we predict the future developments. 
It is obvious that the construction of tests of this 
kind is no simple and easy matter: it is also obvi- 
ous that the interpretation of the results of such 
tests is no simple and easy matter; and it is true,
-P-A-G-E-21
  
  MENTAL MEASUREMENTS 23 
though it may not be so obvious, that the adequate 
administration of such tests is by no means so sim- 
ple and easy as it may seem to the amateur. 
The construction of an intelligence test for chil- 
dren involves the careful sifting out of those things 
which the children in the group to be tested have 
had a chance to learn, and which furthermore rep- 
resent the type of learning which is of the greatest 
general importance for practical life. School top- 
ies, and other special topics are necessarily largely 
avoided, especially for the early years. The tests 
as constructed for children of one nation will not 
apply to children of another nation without saga- 
cious modification: and even the best tests for 
American children must in many instances be ap- 
plied and interpreted with great discretion. We 
can well understand that) Binet and Simon required 
more than ten years of work for the construction 
of their scale, and that an enormous amount of 
work was required for the adaptation of the scale 
to American needs. For it must be understood that 
there is little of the a priori or arbitrary involved 
in these tests. They are not based on theoretical 
assumptions as to what children ought to have 
learned, but on concrete evidence as to what chil- 
dren of varying ages and varying conditions actu- 
ally have learned. In the ease of the Stanford Re- 
vision, the evidence has been obtained from a thou- 
sand cases. 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  24 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
It is true that almost anyone, without any train- 
ing or knowledge of this subject, can construct a 
“‘test’’ that looks very much like an intelligence 
test, and that some ignoramuses have done so. But 
it is, of course, also true that such tests are worth- 
less. To reject the actual intelligence tests, labori- 
ously constructed by experts, because of their simi- 
larity to fake tests, is exactly like rejecting the 
astronomer’s telescope because a tin tube, which 
looks something like the telescope, doesn’t aid 
vision. 
The application of tests to children, and the inter- 
pretation of results require much more than knowl- 
edge of the mechanical method of scoring. For 
purely statistical purposes, routine administration 
and scoring of tests on thousands of children may 
give important results. But in the actual use of 
tests, the individual case is the all-important thing. 
While one may trust that in the testing of five 
thousand children, by persons who are merely com- 
petent to follow routine directions, the errors in 
rating will balance each other, so that as many 
children will be rated too high as are rated too low, 
it should not be forgotten that serious injustice will 
be done to these misrated individual cases. In the 
application of the test, widely divergent results 
may be obtained by inexpert testers, and the inter- 
pretation of the results, even when these are care- 
fully obtained, depends upon knowledge of children 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
MENTAL MEASUREMENTS 25 
in general, and upon study of the conditions in 
which the particular child has been reared. 
Unfortunately, there is at present a great deal of 
application of the Binet-Simon tests by persons who 
are extremely incompetent. Our department is fre- 
quently called upon to rectify the mistake of inex- 
pert testers who have rated feeble-minded children 
as normal; and normal, or even exceptionally bright 
children, as feeble-minded, causing the parents 
great trouble and expense. It can hardly be too 
much emphasized that the consultation of a hand- 
book on mental testing, or a six weeks’ summer 
course in mental testing, or a medical degree of the 
usual sort does not give any person competence in 
this line; and that even several years of practical 
experience without proper training and supervision 
may leave the tester as incompetent as when he 
began. 
The ‘‘tests,’’ even the best devised, are after all 
very much like the thermometers, sphygmomanom- 
eters, x-ray machines, and other apparatus which 
the physician uses in physical diagnosis. Facility 
in the routine uses of these instruments does not 
make a diagnostician, although the trained diag- 
nostician may make use of assistants whose com- 
petency is restricted to mechanical handling of the 
instruments under his supervision. In regions 
where competent physicians are not obtainable, 
medical diagnosis and treatment of a rough and
-P-A-G-E-24
  26 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
ready kind are frequently administered by some 
venturesome individual, frequently with some meas- 
ure of success, although not without risk. So, too, 
in the absence of competent psychologists, it may 
be helpful in the long run to have mental testing 
done by a physician, school teacher, or minister, or 
some other person who has picked up a smattering 
of the subject. But such conditions, either in men- 
tal or physical diagnosis, are to be deplored, and 
under these conditions patients are subjected to 
considerable risk. Intelligence testing is the work 
of a specialist, and requires a specialist’s training. 
The most serious danger in mental measurement 
today is the incompetent tester, without psycholog- 
ical background, who has picked up a superficial 
acquaintance with intelligence tests in a summer 
course, or as a side issue in a course in education, 
sociology, or general psychology. The rash tester 
who knows absolutely nothing about the subject is 
less dangerous than the smatterer. 
In spite of all too general incompetence in admin- 
istration and interpretation, and in spite of the 
acknowledged fact that the tests are far from per- 
fect, the Binet-Simon tests have proved their worth, 
and are now essential for the classification of chil- 
dren with respect to intelligence. This success has 
immensely stimulated research and application in 
four directions, namely, in the direction of general’ 
intelligence tests for adults; in the direction of
-P-A-G-E-25
  MENTAL MEASUREMENTS 27 
tests for special abilities; in the direction of voca- 
tional tests; and in the direction of educational 
tests. Concerning the educational tests, I shall 
have nothing to say, since they are in the restricted 
field of measurement of schoolroom subjects, such 
as grammar, Latin, arithmetic, etc., and hence con- 
stitute a topic somewhat apart from mental meas- 
urements. The educational tests preferably belong 
to departments of education, just as strictly as men- 
tal measurements belong to psychology, and it is in 
general productive of inefficiency for either depart- 
ment to operate in the field of the other. 
The big development of intelligence tests for 
adults in America and England was, of course, due 
to the activities of Dr. Yerkes’ band of psycholo- 
gists during the war. The Alpha and Beta tests 
are now matters of common acquaintance, and_ 
many of the results of the tests of drafted men are 
common property. Some of the results are the 
subjects of common controversy; and some, the sub- 
jects of too common misunderstanding. From this 
work came a great impetus to apply these and sim- 
ilar tests to college and high school students, pris- 
oners, immigrants, and other selected groups; and 
a persistent psychologist at one of the large uni- 
versities has even pursued the faculty relentlessly 
with the Alpha test. (But without much success, 
the faculty members dodging it actively.) 
This test has been made a model for a large num-
-P-A-G-E-26
28 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
ber of imitations and improvements, among which 
the Thorndike, Thurston, and Anderson tests are 
the best known. Not all the activity in these lines 
has been intelligent, and some of the general results 
are perhaps confusing and misleading. Much mis- 
understanding has been caused by the rash conclu- 
sions and hasty assumptions of some of the most 
prominent boosters of mental tests since the war, 
and a vast amount of rubbish has been put out as 
intelligence tests. But on the other hand, progress 
has been made, the confusions are being cleared up, 
the reckless theorists and testers are being educated 
or suppressed, and the last three years have pro- 
duced a substantial amount of valuable results. 
The public as a whole, and even some of the men- 
tal testers, have failed to appreciate the time, labor, 
psychological training, and scientific procedure 
necessary to produce an intelligence test. Although 
the development of the Alpha and Beta tests, and 
their application, was due largely to Dr. Yerkes’ 
persistent initiative, and to the skill and efficiency 
of his coadjutors, the tests and their applications 
were based on a large amount of work which had 
been done before the war. The basis for the Alpha 
test was largely a set of tests which had previously 
been elaborated by Otis; but both Otis and the 
Army psychologists were guided by the results of 
still earlier work. The Beta tests—the tests for il- 
literates—were based on the previous work of Por-
-P-A-G-E-27
    
MENTAL MEASUREMENTS 29 
teus, Franz, and many others. But even so, the 
Alpha and Beta tests were not hasty compilations, 
but were the final results of an intensive investiga- 
tion in which preliminary forms of the tests were 
used in research on recruits at two army camps, 
and on the basis of which the improvements and 
revisions were made. This work was so thoroughly 
done that even now the Alpha test is very useful for 
application to certain groups, such as skilled labor- 
ers, criminals, and possibly immigrants, although 
better tests have been produced for college matricu- 
lants, and other selected groups. An improvement 
on the Beta test for group application has not yet 
been developed. 
It is unfortunate that a great deal of misuse has 
been made of some results of the army testing work. 
Demagogues and popular writers have seized upon 
certain deductions and twisted them to their own 
purposes, sometimes to sneer at democracy, some- 
times to sneer at mental tests. It is especially un- 
fortunate that a comparison made on a small group 
of soldiers between the Alpha test ratings and the 
“mental age ratings’? on the Binet-Simon tests, 
should have received wide publicity without ade- 
quate explanations. The statement that the aver- 
age ‘‘mental age’’ of the draft was 13.5 years is 
viciously misleading, because the term ‘‘mental 
age’’ in this connection is a purely technical term 
and is not intended to be taken literally. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  30 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
Binet-Simon Scale of ages really stops at 14, the 
following two grades being ‘‘adult’’ and ‘‘superior 
adult’’; sometimes specified as 16 and 18 years re- 
spectively. This scale, therefore, is not designed to 
measure the diverse lines of mental acquisition of 
adult life; and it is not assumed by those acquainted 
with the system that the adult who makes only a 
grade of 12 in the Binet-Simon Scale actually has 
the mental characteristics of a child of 12. Terman, 
who is certainly well acquainted with both the 
Binet-Simon and the Army tests, protested strongly 
against this attempt to translate adult performance 
on the Alpha and Beta tests into terms of ‘‘mental 
age’’ on the Binet-Simon Scale. Such procedure 
seems to be against the whole purpose and principle 
of mental measurements and has produced deplor- 
able results in the hands of popular writers in the 
daily press and various journals of the propagan- 
dists and the literatti. 
Furthermore, it is well understood by those who 
did the army work that the draft was not repre- 
sentative of American male intelligence, for reasons 
too obvious to need elaboration. The assumption 
to the contrary, which has unfortunately been 
widely made, would render the results of the army 
work absolutely useless for any comparative pur- 
poses. In fact, all the valid objections which 
popular critics have made against the wild in- 
terpretations placed on the army results were made
-P-A-G-E-29
  MENTAL MEASUREMENTS 31 
earlier, and much more logically, by competent 
psychologists. The popular criticisms of the sup- 
posed results of the Army tests reduce in the main, 
although perhaps not altogether, to two classes: 
objection to wild interpretations which psychol- 
ogists had already rejected and strongly deplored, 
and objections based on ignorance of the purposes 
and methods of construction of the tests. 
It is true, however, that certain overly enthusias- 
tic individuals in the field of mental measurements 
have contributed to the confusion by exaggerated 
claims for the tests, and by rash interpretations. 
The unfortunate claim to which I previously re- 
ferred, that intelligence tests do not measure ac- 
quisition but measure native capacity directly, is 
a sample of the misinterpretations which have con- 
tributed to the popular doubts concerning the tests; 
although I believe the confusion on these points is 
no longer serious. 
There are certain other points in connection with 
the wider application of intelligence tests upon 
which there has been and still is some misunder- 
standing on the part of certain active workers in 
the field. Some have failed to realize that a test 
must be developed with reference to the type of 
group to whom it is to be applied, and standardized 
for that type. I have already mentioned the con- 
fusion due to the uncritical application of chil- 
dren’s tests to adults. The application of the Alpha
-P-A-G-E-30
    32 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
test to college students is apt to be equally un- 
fortunate, because the Alpha test was not made 
for such a selected group, and hence does not dif- 
ferentiate them in the most useful way. For the 
differentiation of college matriculates, a test worked 
out for that type of individual must be used. 
Several successful tests for this purpose have been 
elaborated, mostly following the general line of the 
Otis and Army tests; and one of these, devised by 
Dr. Johnson, is now used at Johns Hopkins. 
A similar confusion appears in the use and in- 
terpretation of non-language tests, which are neces- 
sary for the testing of illiterates, foreigners, and the 
deaf. Such tests are the form board, devised by 
Seguin and improved by Goddard and others; maze 
tests devised by Porteus and others after his model; 
picture puzzles, ete. The essential point in all these 
tests is that the instructions can be given by sign 
alone, without language. But standards devised 
for one group cannot be applied simpliciter to a 
group of another type, and the tests are not equally 
applicable to all groups. For some groups, such 
as deaf children, it is essential that the acquisitions 
measured be such as may be learned without help 
from either spoken or written language. For 
illiterates in general, the acquisitions measured 
must be such as may be acquired without written 
languages, but do depend upon spoken language. 
For foreigners who read and write in their own
-P-A-G-E-31
    MENTAL MEASUREMENTS 33 
language, but are illiterate in English, the condi- 
tions are still different, since the conditions of ac- 
quisition are in this case comparable to those of 
the literate English-speaking persons, but the con- 
ditions of measurement are necessarily different. 
These several requirements are not theoretical, but 
primarily practical, in conformity with the actual 
method of intelligence testing. We measure the 
capacity for learning, indirectly, by measuring that 
which has been learned, and in every case the 
estimation of capacity depends on the amount which 
has been learned, and the opportunities the in- 
dividual has had to learn. 
It is obvious, therefore, that all the non-language 
tests must ultimately be standardized for the par- 
ticular groups to which they are applied. We may 
standardize one of these tests for normal children 
in terms of the Binet-Simon Scale by giving both 
the Binet-Simon and the non-language tests to a 
large group, and comparing the scores on the two. 
We may find then that statistically, children who 
make a certain rating on the Binet-Simon Scale 
make a certain definite rating on the non-language 
test, and may approximately, therefore, translate 
ratings obtained by applying the one test into 
equivalent ratings in the other. But this sort of 
standardization does not help us much and may be 
seriously misleading, when we apply the non- 
language test to the totally deaf child, whose con-
-P-A-G-E-32
  34 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
ditions of acquisition have been radically different 
from those of the illiterates. To assume that the 
deaf child who makes the same rating as the nor- 
mal child on a non-language test has the same level 
of intelligence, would be not only contrary to fact, 
but contrary to the fundamental principles of in- 
terpretation in mental measurements. Similarly, 
standards attained on English-speaking illiterates 
cannot be applied directly to literate foreigners or 
to deaf children, tested by the same non-language 
test. Standards for each group must be devised 
directly for those groups. 
Although these considerations are obvious to any 
one who is familiar with the field of individual 
psychology, they have unfortunately been neglected 
by many of the routine workers in this field, and 
the resulting chaos is deplorable. 
I have spoken of the ‘‘success’’ which has at- 
tended intelligence testing. I must point out, how- 
ever, that some of the evidence which has been 
adduced is quite ineffectual. As an example of this 
situation I may refer to the problem concerning 
the usefulness of intelligence test ratings as a means 
of predicting success in college. A great deal of 
statistical work has been done on the comparison 
of college grades with intelligence test ratings, but 
I fear that much of this work is of small conse- 
quence. To an unfortunately serious extent, the 
merely statistical problem has been confused with
-P-A-G-E-33
  MENTAL MEASUREMENTS 35 
the individual problem, and the college problem is 
largely individual. The application of intelligence 
ratings, and the obtaining a coefficient of correla- 
tion between the ratings and college grades, tells 
us very little, because the coefficients are usually 
low (below .5), and the significance of such a 
coefficient is not self-evident, but requires much 
detailed investigation of the data, and further in- 
vestigation of the students themselves in many 
cases. 
This ‘is a highly technical problem into details 
of which it is not necessary to go here; but it is 
important that I should say that Pearson’s co- 
efficient has been grievously misused in unin- 
telligent work in mental measurements, and the 
derivation of a coefficient has frequently been made 
the end of an investigation, when it is properly the 
beginning only. The coefficients usually obtained 
between the test grades and grades of practical ac- 
complishment tell us very little about the actual 
value of the test. In connection with college 
grades, for example, a ‘‘test’’ which shows a low 
coefficient of correlation may be a very efficient test; 
and a test which gives a higher coefficient may not 
be a better test. The coefficient alone tells us noth- 
ing; and even in conjunction with the probable 
error and coefficient of regression, does not tell us 
much. Yet, unfortunately, we find sweeping con- 
clusions based on a mere modest coefficient, with-  
-P-A-G-E-34
  36 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
out even consideration of the coefficient of regres- 
sion, and no real research involved. This naive and 
reckless use of the correlation method has been the 
source of much and serious evil, and is something 
for which the blame lies entirely with persons who 
are supposed to be competent in the field of mental 
measurements. 
Such detailed work as that which Dr. Johnson 
is supervising in our department, and such as has 
been carried on at Yale and a few other places, 
tends to show that an intelligence test of’a good 
type is very useful for the rating of candidates for 
matriculation; and if our present agreement with 
the State of Maryland, by which we are obliged to 
take High School graduates without examination, 
could be terminated, we ought to make a satisfac- 
tory intelligence test grade a part of the require- 
ment for admission. But I cannot recommend the 
substitution of an intelligence test for entrance 
examinations and for high school records, for it is 
highly probable that such a substitution would be 
disastrous. I think psychologists working in this 
field are in general agreement against such a step, 
although it has been advocated by certain persons 
prominent in the field of educational psychology. 
No intelligence test can possibly take the place of 
evidence that the candidate has applied himself to 
opportunities in high school, and a substitution of 
this sort would, in a short time, destroy the useful-
-P-A-G-E-35
MENTAL MEASUREMENTS 37 
ness of the high school. The proper normal basis 
for admission to college, where efficient selection 
is desired, is, first, a record of satisfactory work in 
high school, or with an accredited tutor for a suffi- 
cient period; second, a thorough examination in 
certain subjects, at least in English and Mathemat- 
ics; and, third, an intelligence test. No one of 
these three alone gives the best possible basis for 
admission, and the intelligence test has come to 
be as important as either of the other requirements 
alone. Of course, moral and other personal con- 
siderations should be applied in addition to this 
formal basis. 
Intelligence testing is not the most important part 
of mental measurements. But I have dwelt upon 
intelligence testing at relatively great length be- 
cause it enables us to understand the development, 
methods, and purpose of the whole subject. We 
must not forget that the important work before 
us is the measurement of special aptitudes. This 
is important not only for educational practice, in 
the ordinary sense of the term, but also for the field 
of commerce, industry, and labor, in a much wider 
way. 
We must develop tests for capacity not only for 
the work of switchboard operators, telegraphers, 
and jobs in a rubber factory: we must eventually 
devise means for the determination of aptitudes in 
the learned professions, including the profession of
-P-A-G-E-36
  38 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
being a student in a cultural college. Such develop- 
ment depends not only on the present methods of 
individual psychology, namely, the measurement of 
capacity for concrete tasks through the measure- 
ment of what has been acquired in them or in 
similar tasks, but also upon the analytic methods of 
experimental psychology, hitherto little used in the 
individual field. Progress has been made in both 
directions. Tests for efficiency in certain trades 
have been constructed and standardized. Analyt- 
ical tests which are possible of application in vari- 
ous situations, as soon as these situations are fully 
analyzed, have also been developed. As an illustra- 
tion I may mention the direct test of learning 
capacity, and test of ability to avoid learning when 
such avoidance is necessary: such tests, namely, as 
the so-called substitution tests and color-naming 
tests designed by Woodworth, whose contributions 
to the field have been especially noteworthy. We 
have tests for the ability to sustain attention to 
simple routine jobs of a monotonous type; and as 
a result of the work of my own group in the Air 
Service, we have a type of test of sustained dis- 
tributed attention to a number of jobs simul- 
‘taneously; such attention as is required by the 
automobile driver in traffic. Great future develop- 
ment is necessary along these lines, and may rea- 
sonably be expected to occur. 
The attempt to make application of mental
-P-A-G-E-37
MENTAL MEASUREMENTS 39 
measurements to problems of commerce and indus- 
try goes back to almost as early a date as the ap- 
plication to children. The long existing demand 
for tests of this kind is abundantly demonstrated 
by the fraudulent enterprises which have long 
flourished in this field under the general title of 
“character analysis.’’ It is impossible to estimate 
with any exactitude the number of character 
analysts now operating in the United States, or the 
amount of money annually extracted from their 
very extensive sucker lists. The various systems 
of character analysis have grown up historically 
from the systems of phrenology founded by Gall 
and Spiirzheim, and are none of them psychological 
either in foundation or practice. They agree 
generally in that they attempt to evaluate mental 
and emotional capacities and characteristics from 
anatomical signs, such as the shape of the nose and 
ears, and the color and texture of the hair. They 
disagree strongly on the inferences made from these 
anatomical signs, and this disagreement is a good 
indication of the fact that none of these systems 
have either psychological or biological warrant. 
The fact that none of these systems are based 
on experimental work of a scientific character is 
sufficient to establish that the probability of any of 
them hitting upon anything of value is extremely 
low. Nevertheless, there is a profitable sale of 
books embodying the system, a profitable working
-P-A-G-E-38
40 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
of lecture: courses of instruction in the various 
systems, and a still more profitable rake-off from 
business concerns which are induced to have the 
systems applied to their employees at so much per 
head. 
The existence and activity of this group of char- 
acter analysts has been a great hindrance to the 
legitimate development of individual psychology, 
for these persons do not hesitate to advertise them- 
selves as psychologists, and their victims who have 
accepted them in good faith as such are apt to shy 
violently at the name psychologist for some time 
thereafter. We should expect those who have asked 
for bread and been given a stone to be somewhat 
skittish thereafter about biting upon bread offered 
in a package with a similar label. i 
In spite of this, however, the real demand is 
slowly being fulfilled. Not only is research in 
progress and application being made under the 
direction of psychologists, but many employment 
managers are using tests which the psychologists 
have devised. While the disadvantages of inex- 
pert application are present here, the results are 
apparently not so serious as in the case of the in- 
expert testing of children, and in most cases the 
tests, even if not selected most advantageously, and 
even if not applied with the greatest efficiency, seem 
to be a distinct help; and with moderately intelli- 
gent use of tests, conditions are better than without
-P-A-G-E-39
  
  MENTAL MEASUREMENTS 41 
the tests. This is especially true of the employ- 
ment of clerical help, and in other lines where em- 
ployees must be taken directly into lines of work 
for which rather full previous learning is assumed, 
and in which there is no opportunity to train 
novices in the details of the business. In case of 
scarcity of labor, where there are not sufficient ap- 
plicants to fill the positions, all methods of selec- 
tion, of course, fail. 
The great promise of progress in the industrial 
field, however, comes from the nature of the field 
itself. It is a necessary characteristic of business 
enterprise not to be permanently discouraged by 
failure, and to be willing to make investments for 
future profit. Hence, industrial organizations are 
willing to devote money to research along lines 
which have a reasonable promise of future benefits. 
Certain industrial organizations are even willing to 
go further, and spend money for research even when 
it is known in advance that the results of the re- 
search will not be immediately applicable to indus- 
try. The laboratory for research in pure science 
maintained by the National Lamp Works is one 
instance of this profound faith that everything dis- 
covered by pure science will have ultimately a prac- 
tical application. In respect to mental measure- 
ments, it is clear that the development of means for 
the selection, promotion and training of employees 
is one of the lines of immediate benefits which re- 
   
-P-A-G-E-40
  
  42 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
dound to both employer and employee; and com- 
mercial and industrial organizations are increas- 
ingly willing to pay their own way in this matter. 
In this respect, commercial and industrial psy- 
chology is in better shape than any other branch of 
applied psychology. No one is financially in- 
terested in improved conditions for children, or 
even in improved methods of training teachers, and 
hence research along these lines depends upon 
philanthropic individuals, private foundations, and 
governmental grants. Available private funds are 
very limited, and public grants are much more 
easily obtained for any other purpose than for 
scientific research, especially when the scientific re- 
search does not have immediate economic bearing. 
Of course, in the development of measurements 
and technique in the industrial field, a great deal 
of assistance is coming from universities, founda- 
tions, and organizations such as the Carnegie In- 
stitute in Pittsburgh, but the main reliance for sup- 
port must be in the industrial and commercial en- 
terprises directly concerned. 
The development of efficient mental measure- 
ments in any industry depends on prolonged, inten- 
sive, and intelligent cooperation between the 
psychologists and individuals in that industry. No 
psychologist supposes for a minute that he can, 
' with nothing but psychological assistance, develop 
such measurements. The requirements of the in-
-P-A-G-E-41
MENTAL MEASUREMENTS 43 
dustry must first be studied in great detail. Every 
distinct job in the industry must have its specific 
requirements on the workmen or operators ac- 
curately analyzed. The analysis must be made by 
men thoroughly familiar with all the details of the 
jobs. Second, the requirements which the job 
makes upon the men must be analyzed, and this is, 
the most difficult part of the work, requiring the 
highest skill of the psychologist, and involving a 
separate research problem for each job. Third, the 
tests competent to measure these personal quali- 
fications must be devised. In some cases, existing 
tests may be found available; in other cases, the 
tests must be modified to suit specific needs; in still 
other cases, new tests must be developed. 
But the problem does not end here, nor with the 
standardization of the technique and interpretation 
of the ‘measurements, and the training of persons 
competent to administer and interpret them. Few 
jobs are static in their nature, and standardization 
of the requirements for acceptable competency is 
not sufficient. Measurements of progress in com- 
petency are necessary, in order that promotion may 
be on an equitable basis; and in cases where trade 
schools are in existence, or are to be instituted, the 
selection of candidates for admission to these 
schools, and their classification in relation to the 
probable department of the trade for which they 
may adequately be trained, is by no means the least
-P-A-G-E-42
  44 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
important part of the problem. Finally, from all 
this systematic labor, some considerable informa- 
tion as to proper methods of training ought to be 
made available. Such a program makes the cele- 
brated labors of Hercules look like a game of golf: 
but this is the type of program which applied 
psychology faces. 
‘While on the topic of commercial and industrial 
psychology, I should remark that the applications 
of psychology to industry are by no means re- 
stricted to mental measurements. Some of the most 
important applications are in the general field to 
which individual differences are only incidental. 
Many problems concerning fatigue, illumination, 
and other factors important in production and im- 
portant for the well-being of the workers, are with- 
in the province of the psychologist, and will not 
be solved effectively without his cooperation. As 
an instance of this type of work, I may mention 
the case of a factory which employed an experi- 
mental psychologist to improve their methods of 
inspection of finished products for the discovery of 
defects, and which profited financially very greatly 
by the result of his work, while the strain on the 
inspectors was very much lessened. 
There are, of course, still other lines of develop- 
ment of mental measurement. The problems of 
criminality and of immigration are now being sub- 
jected to investigation. The evaluating of emo-
-P-A-G-E-43
MENTAL MEASUREMENTS 45 
tional and moral tendencies has been made the goal 
of a number of investigators, and we may even- 
tually expect important practical applications of 
the results of their labors. 
Throughout the whole field of mental measure- 
ments, including that of intelligence testing, the 
vital need is for the promotion of research. Of late, 
too great emphasis has been placed upon the routine 
application of tests, and their merely statistical 
evaluation. In fact, many individuals labor under 
the delusion that such routine work is research, 
and the compilation of a new ‘‘test’’ and its statis- 
tical standardization is frequently put out as a 
piece of research. Such routine work is, of course, 
necessary in connection with research and applica- 
tion, and we must in the future keep many clerical 
workers and trained technicians busy on such jobs. 
But psychological research is as vital a necessity 
in individual psychology as in general psychology, 
and it is a pity that it cannot be more abundantly 
fostered. Research requires money as well as time, 
and capable workers, and money is not as easily 
obtained for research as it is for application. I 
may add that so far as my own department is con- 
cerned, our interest in measurements is principally 
in its research problems, and only secondarily in 
application and routine; although we cannot ignore 
these others.  
-P-A-G-E-44
  CHAPTER II 
PRESENT DAY SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOLOGY 
The field of individual psychology, which was 
discussed in the preceding chapter, is a field in 
which speculation and metaphysical theories play 
little part. Mental measurements are cold matters 
of fact, whose excellences and defects depend upon 
perfection of technique, adequacy of preparation, 
and skill in grasping and formulating problems. 
The data are concrete, and the same requirements 
are placed upon those who gather and analyze them 
that are placed upon the physicist and chemist. 
The working) hypotheses involved in mental 
measurement are, in fact, more empirical, less 
philosophical, than the working hypothesis of the 
physical sciences. 
In general psychology, conditions are somewhat 
different, although not so different as is popularly 
supposed. General psychology, like the physical 
sciences, involves working hypotheses of a far- 
reaching sort, and wherever significant hypotheses 
are involved, few men can restrain the tendency 
to go beyond the scientific requirements, and in- 
dulge in tenuous speculation. 
I think that psychologists in general are less 
given to speculation than are men in other sciences; 
46
-P-A-G-E-45
    
PRESENT DAY SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOLOGY 47 
but a large amount of speculative theory has been 
injected into psychology by physicists and chemists 
such as Mach and Priestley, by anatomists and 
physiologists such as Gall and Loeb, by philosophers 
such as Locke and Dewey, by medical men such as 
Freud and Conan Doyle, and by historians such as 
McLennan and Robinson. Not to mention the 
theologians, mathematicians, philologists, biol- 
ogists, psychiatrists, and social reformers. 
It is apparently an easy matter for a specialist 
in some line other than psychology to turn over to 
psychology and outline a theory, and a great many 
have been unable to resist the temptation to do so. 
In fact, I have been inclined sometimes to think 
- that the self-appointed task of Diogenes was com- 
parable to the undertaking to find a man of attain- 
ments in some field other than psychology who does 
not think he knows more about psychology than the 
psychologists do. 
The actual reason for the deference paid by the 
psychologist to the philosophical speculations of 
men in other sciences is twofold. The dependence 
of psychology upon all other sciences, and the need 
which is impressed upon every psychologist of 
having a considerable acquaintance with several 
other sciences, naturally predisposes him to setting 
a high value upon the metaphysical opinions of 
leaders in these sciences, as well as upon their 
scientific contributions. Furthermore, it is notable 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
48 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
that many of the most important contributions to 
psychology itself have come from physicists such 
as Helmholtz, physiologists such as Sherrington, 
biologists such as Jennings, philosophers such as 
Berkeley, and men of rank in other sciences. It 
is only recently that psychology as such has existed, 
and its pioneers are to be found among specialists 
in other subjects. The psychologist should 
note, however, that the scientists who have made 
the actual contributions are generally those who 
have the least concerned themselves with psycho- 
logical speculation, and vice versa. 
Regardless of these matters, it still remains true 
that speculation in psychology is an interesting 
thing: that psychologists in the hours of leisure 
from pressure of scientific work like to divert them- 
selves therewith, and that, unfortunately, a few 
psychologists have speculated somewhat wildly. 
The interest of the public in psychology is very 
largely an interest in psychological speculation, 
rather than in the larger and more important part 
of the subject, and naturally, therefore, they are 
most interested in the psychology of the historian, 
the philosopher, and the man in other sciences, who 
can speculate on these matters most entertainingly, 
because they are not impeded by the reference of 
speculation to matters of fact. I am not denying 
the importance and value of speculative work, when 
it proceeds on the basis of sound logic and a thor-
-P-A-G-E-47
PRESENT DAY SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOLOGY 49 
ough knowledge of the work of preceding specula- 
tions, but I propose to discuss today only certain 
speculative movements which have actually had a 
practical bearing. Speculation on the psychological 
aspect of the controversy between mechanism and 
vitalism does not interest me at all, because it has 
no real bearings on psychological research. The 
speculations of the behaviorists, on the other hand, 
do interest me, because their theories have in- 
fluenced their experimental work. 
McDougall remarked recently that behaviorism 
is frequently presented to students as the only al- 
ternative to a certain other type of psychological 
theory commonly known as introspectionalism: 
whereas there is actually a third alternative, 
namely, psychology. McDougall thus presented 
very neatly the crux of the situation. For behavior- 
ism is a speculative point of view derived indi- 
rectly from the physiologists, as a rival to the in- 
trospectionalism derived directly from the philos- 
ophers; and the main current of psychological 
progress flows on quite happily without being much 
affected by either except through a temporary de- 
flection of energy into eddy pools. Psychology, as 
a matter of fact, was just passing the eddies of in- 
trospectionalism when the eddy of behaviorism set 
in. 
Introspectionalism was a historical outgrowth of 
the ‘‘idea philosophy’’ of Malebranche, which John
-P-A-G-E-48
  50 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
Locke took up and transmitted to philosophical 
posterity. This was the notion of the mind as a 
collection of mental furniture: a congeries of some 
sort of shadowy objects, which could be directly 
observed, albeit with difficulty, and which obviously 
therefore should constitute the materials for psy- 
chology. The component parts of this collection, or 
stream, of mental furniture, Malebranche, and 
Locke after him, called ideas. Others called them 
sensations and feelings, and William James called 
them substantive and transitive. states. From this 
conception of mental objects arose the controversy 
over the relation between the world of mental ob- 
jects or mental content on the one hand, and the 
world of matter on the other. This controversy, 
with its traditional positions of materialism, dual- 
ism, and idealism, has proceeded like a complicated 
game of chess in which all moves are upon a fixed 
board—the board in this case being the theory of 
ideas constructed by Malebranche,—and the game 
ceases abruptly when the board is taken away. 
Experimental psychology, in its early history, 
was greatly impressed by the doctrine of ‘‘ideas,’’ 
and struggled bravely to translate its methods and 
results into the terminology appropriate to that doc- 
trine. Worse still, it tried to adapt its experimental 
technique, and mould its problems, to fit the better 
into the theoretical formulations, and in so doing, 
it limited its field narrowly to the study of what
-P-A-G-E-49
PRESENT DAY SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOLOGY 51 
it called ‘‘sensations,’’ ‘‘images,’’ and ‘‘feelings,’’ 
and limited its method to what it called ‘‘introspec- 
tion.”’ 
In spite of this narrow tendency, however, prog- 
ress in real experimental work was rapidly made. 
It was fortunate that many psychologists, after 
formulating a narrow conception of psychology, 
were able to ignore the conception and go about 
their experimental work untroubled by their philos- 
ophy. In the decade prior to 1900, the work of 
McDougall in England, Ebbinghaus in Germany, of 
Miinsterberg, Stratton, Bryan and Harter, Dodge, 
Thorndike, Judd, Angell and others in America be- 
gan to show clearly that the actual field of psy- 
chology could not be described in introspectionalist 
terminology, and that the field was, and always had 
been, far wider than the narrow patch to which the 
philosophy of ideas had attempted to restrict it. 
In that decade, the development of the conception 
of psychology as a truly scientific subject. was well 
under way. The revolt was a quiet one, avoiding 
as far as possible shocking the preceding conven- 
tions, employing familiar terminology where pos- 
sible, and maintaining a profound respect for the 
older generation from whose leading strings the 
younger generation were severing themselves. 
And as quiet revolutions are apt to do, it made 
progress very rapidly. Discussion, and even refer- 
ence to, the problems of psycho-physical parallelism
-P-A-G-E-50
  52 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
and interactionism, and similar points which had 
interested introspectionalists, very soon ceased en- 
tirely. It became admitted that the most important 
business of psychology was not the analysis of the 
objects or contents of observation, but the study of 
the laws and conditions of the actual process of 
observation itself. And, further, it was admitted 
that an essential detail in this study was a study 
of the reactions of the human animal, particularly 
of the conscious reactions. And this did not appear 
to us as something new for psychology, but as some- 
thing in which it had really been engaged for a 
long time, in spite of formulations which sought 
to disguise it and which did somewhat inhibit it. 
The results of this development were not satis- 
factory to all psychologists in the United States, 
and a certain reactionary group was drawn together 
about Professor Titchener in close defensive union 
under the name of ‘‘structural psychologists.’’ 
Various groups of the more progressive received or 
assumed such names as ‘‘functional psychologists,’’ 
“genetic psychologists,’’ etc., names which had but 
a vague significance at the time and have none 
whatever now. 
Since that time, the ‘‘structuralist’’ group (we 
can use the term here as merely indicating reac- 
tionary) has broken up into sub-groups, and in 
spite of a heroic attempt to maintain its principles 
unfalteringly, seems to have suffered modification
-P-A-G-E-51
  
PRESENT DAY SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOLOGY 53 
in different directions, until now those who osten- 
sibly adhere to this party differ from one another 
very much, and most of the sub-groups show strong 
tendencies towards assimilation into the general 
group of plain psychologists. 
It was in this period of transition, and as an 
episode of the transition, that the doctrine of ‘‘be- 
haviorism’’ arose. The behavioristic movement has 
had three well-marked stages, and it is important 
that we should consider all three of them. The first 
stage was quite innocuous, and began with Mc- 
Dougall and Singer as a protest against the idea- 
psychology, and an emphasis on the wider correla- 
tion of mental life and physiological activity, em- 
phasizing responses rather than the hypothetical 
activity of brain cells. This ‘‘behavior psychol- 
ogy’’ received a strong impetus from the rapidly 
developing work on animal behavior which had 
been started by Thorndike, and extended to the 
white rat by Small. 
The second stage was initiated by Watson, who 
adopted the designation of ‘‘behaviorist,’’ and 
headed a revolt which seemed to be against intro- 
spectionalism, but was in reality far more of a re- 
volt against the behavior psychology of McDougall 
and the general progressive movements in psychol- 
ogy. On this account, McDougall has since repu- 
diated the designation of behaviorist, and ‘‘be- 
   
-P-A-G-E-52
  54 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
haviorism’’ now means the Watsonian view ex- 
clusively. 
In order to understand the motivation of the be- 
havioristic school, it is necessary to realize that the 
introspectionalists, in America at least, had repu- 
diated consciousness in its most important and most 
common interpretation. For be it known, that the 
term ‘‘consciousness’’ has long had many significa- 
tions of which two are especially important. First, 
it has meant, as it probably means to most of my 
audience, the observing, or being aware of anything 
whatever; so that a man is said to be conscious 
when he is aware of something, or is observing any- 
thing. Second, the term was applied to the things 
which the idea-philosophy supposed to be alone 
capable of direct observation, namely, to the 
‘‘ideas,’’ or ‘‘sensations’’ and ‘‘feelings’’ which in 
this philosophy made up the ‘‘mind.’’ Now the 
introspectionalist admitted the fact of conscious- 
ness in the first sense, but denied that psychology 
was concerned with it. Both James and Titchener 
stated this point of view explicitly. Consciousness, 
therefore, in so far as this psychology dealt with it, 
was applied to the hypothetical ideas, sensations 
and feelings. Introspection, by this readjustment, 
lost one of its most important traditional meanings, 
and became the name of a vaguely conceived 
method of the observation of ‘‘ideas.’’ In fact, 
it has been very difficult to pin the introspectional-  
-P-A-G-E-53
PRESENT DAY SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOLOGY 55 
ists down to an exact meaning of the term, and I 
have earlier pointed out that their various theories 
as to the use of the term by no means agreed with 
their practice. 
Watson’s first move was to reject consciousness 
in all senses, and introspection in all its meanings. 
This move, according to his own statement, was 
based on an attack I had made upon the doctrine of 
introspection, (which attack, however, was merely 
upon one of the theoretical significations of the 
term and upon the introspectionalist theory of 
images) ; and was a part of my program to restore 
the concept of consciousness, as the fact or act of 
observing, to its rightful place in psychology. So 
that although Watson has called me the father of 
behaviorism, I must insist that my parency was 
entirely inadvertent. 
Watson repudiated entirely observation as a 
matter for scientific consideration, as the introspec- 
tionalists had already done, and rejected introspec- 
tion also, not only in the traditional sense, but also 
in the various vague introspectionalist senses, and 
unfortunately also rejected the very common sense 
usage which includes under the term the observa- 
tion of one’s own bodily processes. This rejection 
led directly to the position that although the ex- 
perimenter could observe his subject, whether 
human or animal, he could not consider any ob- 
servation his subject might make: for such ob-
-P-A-G-E-54
56 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
servations are not only conscious, but they are also, 
by one or the other of the definitions of the term, 
introspection. 
‘Watson’s behaviorism, teh threw overboard all 
experimental methods which depended upon the 
subject’s own observation. You could not deter- 
mine the brightness of light which would produce 
a perception of light because that determination 
would involve ‘‘introspection’’ in one of its senses: 
and ‘‘consciousness’’ in its legitimate sense. You 
could not even make the usual dynamometer tests, 
because that would involve the subject’s introspec- 
tion as to whether he really was squeezing the 
dynamometer as hard as possible. By a simple 
analogy, no instructions could be given to a subject. 
The human animal, in regard to introspection, was 
to be treated just like a four-legged animal, so, to 
make the case complete, he must be treated just like 
the white rat which cannot be given verbal instruc- 
tion. 
Behaviorism, in other words, accepted the Tit- 
chenerian view that there was a vaguely defined 
field for introspection but proposed to ignore it. 
Observations made by the person experimented up- 
on (the reactor, or subject) were not desired: the 
experimenter trusted and recorded his own observa- 
tion of the subject: but he denied himself the use 
of the subject’s observation, which psychologists 
in general have found of very great assistance.
-P-A-G-E-55
PRESENT DAY SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOLOGY 57 
The result of this new position of the behaviorists 
was appalling, or amusing, according to your point 
of view. Subjects were put through reactions with 
a minimum of instruction, and the experimenter 
conscientiously refrained from asking them after- 
wards what they had been trying to do. In some 
eases the results were a bewildering maze of con- 
fusion; in others, the experimenter made interpreta- 
tions which were exploded when later investigators 
repeated the work under strict psychological con- 
ditions. 
Perhaps the most striking reductio ad absurdum 
of the whole theory was furnished by an experi- 
menter in a Western university, who obtained from 
several subjects records of their tapping on a simple 
telegraphic type of key. Apparently the subject 
was merely instructed to sit by a table on which 
the key was placed, and to keep on tapping until 
told to stop. These instructions, although verbal, 
were such as could theoretically have been given 
by signs alone. The taps were recorded on the 
smoked paper of a revolving drum and subse- 
quently the spacing of the taps was measured. 
Interesting periodic groupings of the taps were dis- 
covered, and the experimenter elaborated a com- 
plicated mathematical formula to account for this, 
and to indicate a law of periodicity in behavior. 
One of the reactors distributed his taps in groups 
of 22, with a distinct pause between groups. Since
-P-A-G-E-56
  58 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
the general rate of tapping in this case approxi- 
mated the beats in waltz time, and waltz music is 
typically written with a pause or prolonged note 
in the eighth measure of each half strain, I wrote 
to the experimenter suggesting the inquiry whether 
this subject was not consciously beating out a waltz 
rhythm. The experimenter replied indignantly 
that he had not, and would not, ask the subject 
about it, because he was a behaviorist, interested 
only in scientific results, and not at all in intro- 
spection. 
The uselessness of such experimental work even- 
tually dawned upon the group of behaviorists, and 
their theories were very vitally modified in conse- 
quence. They then adopted the notion which 
several psychologists had already suggested to 
them, that they could consider speech as a form 
of behavior; a response of the vocal organs: that 
the air waves resulting from the experimenter’s 
vocalizations are legitimate stimuli to the ears of 
the subject: and that the vocal reactions of the 
subject himself should be recorded and emphasized 
in interpretation along with the reactions of his 
arms, legs, and vascular system. 
The final form of behaviorism, therefore, actually 
provides for doing all that the introspectionalists 
of any type have done, by the mere substitution 
of the terms ‘‘vocal behavior’ and ‘‘graphiec be- 
havior’’ for the usual spoken and written reports
-P-A-G-E-57
  
  PRESENT DAY SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOLOGY 59 
of introspection. It has, in fact, been acknowledged 
by one of the leading American introspectionalists 
that the difference in theory between the two 
schools is now merely verbal. 
If theory alone were important, we might now 
consider the whole behavioristic episode closed, the 
behaviorists having completed their somewhat spec- 
ulative side excursion, and returned to the road at 
a point somewhat in advance of that at which they 
left it. A lexicon could be prepared by which the 
verbiage of the behaviorists could readily be trans- 
lated from behaviorism into ordinary psychology, 
and all would be well. But unfortunately, the epi- 
sode is not quite closed, since the habits of loose 
experimentation formed by behaviorists under their 
first theory still seem to cling to them under their 
second, and are maintained in part through the 
retention of the earlier terminology, and in part 
by the same attitude towards analytical work which 
contributed to the earlier defection from psy- 
chology. 
This looseness of experimental procedure and in- 
terpretation may be illustrated by referring to an 
investigation which is typical. The psychologist 
has long been interested in the genetic problem, 
but has found its difficulties very great. We should 
like to know, for example, at what age or stage 
of development the child first begins to experience 
fear. But no one has as yet found a method of 
   
-P-A-G-E-58
  60 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
solving this problem, although a considerable num- 
ber of writers of popular texts on the child give 
dogmatic opinions on this as on the many other | 
problems of childhood* 
But the behaviorist on this point has a simple 
method of approach. He stimulates the child, per- 
haps by a loud, shrill note; obtains a reaction which 
is somewhat like certain responses of the adult in 
certain types of fear; and states very confidently 
that the child showed the ‘‘fear-reaction.’’ 
The psychologist, of course, cannot accept this 
conclusion so easily. He notes that the reaction 
is not only similar to certain fear-reactions by the 
adult, but that it is just as similar to certain other 
reactions; for example, to certain reactions the adult 
makes to painful stimulations without fear. He 
doesn’t know, therefore, whether this is a fear-re- 
action or a pain-reaction; nor does he even know 
for certain how far the infant, when suffering a 
certain type of fear or pain, will agree in his re- 
actions with the adult or the older child. 
In theory, these considerations should occur to_ 
the behaviorist as well as to the psychologist; but 
unfortunately, in a great many cases, they do not 
occur to him. Nor is he always willing to see them 
when they are called to his attention. In the illus- 
*For sheer literary ingenuity, the various books on the “psychol- 
ogy of childhood”, are to be highly commended. It is worthy of note 
that most of these books were written by professors of philosophy, ethics or education, and that the psychologists have been very cau- 
tious about generalizing in this field.
-P-A-G-E-59
PRESENT DAY SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOLOGY 61 
tration given, the behaviorist would probably claim 
that all he means by fear is that particular reac- 
tion, regardless of the other types of reaction 
which occur in what adults call fear, and regardless 
of the very similar reaction which occurs in what 
adults call pain. In that case, of course, the use 
of the term ‘‘fear’’ is entirely misleading. But if 
the behaviorist did not use the term, but simply 
described the actual reaction evoked by an actual 
stimulus, his results would have little bearing on 
the problem he started to investigate. He would 
simply have the record of certain arm, leg, trunk, 
and vocal reactions which the child made to cer- 
tain acoustical stimulations, and would need a vast 
amount of further experimental work before he 
could connect these with the reactions which adults 
make to various stimuli. He would have no basis 
so far for generalization as to the origin of fear, 
nor its genetic relation to other emotions. 
We have here come upon the actual vital point 
of behaviorism, which constitutes its serious short- 
coming. Psychology, from the time of Aristotle, 
has been interested in the study of behavior, and 
the great progress made in experimental psychology 
in the last sixty years has been in the perfection of 
means of measuring and recording behavior. The 
flourishing of the introspectional school, which did 
neglect the behavior side of life, did not prevent this 
great development. The important differentia of
-P-A-G-E-60
  62 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
behaviorism are, first, that it does not sufficiently 
emphasize the study of behavior, and second, that 
it permits itself rash and hasty inferences from 
behavior imperfectly studied. 
In the case of the child, the crying need is for 
extensive and detailed study of the child’s reactions 
under carefully controlled conditions, with full psy- 
chological technique. It will be a long time before 
interpretation in terms of fear, judgment, and other 
terms of adult life will be in order: a vast mass 
of data must first be gathered. In other words, 
what is needed is not behavioristic work, but an 
intensive study of behavior by methods which psy- 
chology has been developing and perfecting during 
the last generation. And in the case of adult psy- 
chology, the same furthering of sober, scientific in- 
vestigation is needed. 
The ‘‘idea psychology’’ has not only given rise 
to the schools of introspectionalism and behavior- 
ism, but also to a still more interesting and thriving 
movement which is popularly known as Freudian- 
ism, or more strictly, psychoanalysis. This move- 
ment has caught the public attention very strongly 
for two reasons, first, because it deals much, and 
often crudely with sex problems; and second, be- 
cause it offers a system of mental healing, an offer 
which has always caught the attention of the crowd, 
as the history of New Thought, Christian Science, 
and many other cults demonstrates. Into this part 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
  
PRESENT DAY SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOLOGY 63 
of the movement I shall not go extensively. Janet, 
the eminent French psychiatrist, long ago pointed 
out that the results of treatment by the adepts in 
the various systems of mental healing have no bear- 
ing on the evaluation of their theories, because all 
the systems offer equally good evidence of cures 
effected. Psychoanalysts point to ‘‘cures’’; so do 
Christian Scientists, and New Thoughtists; and the 
Grotto of Lourdes offers its cures also, as do the 
Mormon elders and other exponents of divine heal- 
ing, and the proponents of osteopathy, chiroprac- 
tics, and numerous other systems, including that 
of the more recently notorious Mr. Coué. Janet 
goes further and admits that neuropathic cases 
may actually be greatly helped—‘‘cured”’ is a rela- 
tive term—by all of these systems, whose theories 
are so widely diverse. 
Nor would the theories of the psychoanalysts 
interest us, except for the fact that they claim to 
supplant psychology, and the methods even of the 
historian and archaeologist; and to give a simple 
and clear explanation of religion, art, literature, and 
almost everything else of human interest. Further, 
the theories and methods of psychoanalysis have 
progressively absorbed a great deal of our prosaic 
psychological data, reformulating them, of course, 
in accordance with psychoanalytic principles, so 
that it is coming to be popularly supposed that 
these data were discovered by the psychoanalysts, 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
64 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
and it is even frequently supposed that psychology 
and psychoanalysis are identical, instead of antag- 
onistic. Even some psychologists, whose theories 
were strictly those of the idea philosophy, have 
been fascinated by the new formulation, which is 
in reality a logical development and expansion of 
that philosophy. 
It is practically impossible to give an outline of 
psychoanalytic theories which is not open to im- 
mediate objection. The vast expansion of the 
school, and its popularization by many writers has 
resulted in a great multiplicity of systems, some 
of which differ from one another so much as to be 
really contradictory. In addition to the three 
orthodox divisions of the school, represented by 
Freud the founder, and by Jung and Adler, his 
most celebrated pupils, there are many ‘‘wild’’ 
systems which are denounced by the leading psy- 
choanalysts. Again, the orthodox exponents ex- 
press themselves in conflicting ways. A psycho- 
analyst who strongly condemned a recent book* of 
mine which deals with the problem, while admitting 
that every point I made was backed up by authentic 
quotations from the writings of accepted authori- 
ties, denounced my procedure as unfair, and said 
that I should also have considered other passages 
from these same authors, in which they say the   
*Mysticism, Bro cian, and Scientific Psychology, St. Louis, 
Cc. V. Mosby Co., 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
  PRESENT DAY SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOLOGY 65 
exact opposite. Again, in the case of many psycho- 
analysts, there is an exoteric and an esoteric doc- 
trine, the doctrines presented for public consump- 
tion being much milder in their treatment of sex 
than are the doctrines presented to the initiated. 
There are, however, certain principles which are 
characteristic of the general movement, which can- 
not be denied. And these points alone I shall dis- 
cuss. 
In the hands of some of the classical ‘‘idea psy- 
chologists,’’ the ‘‘ideas’’ are not merely mental 
furniture, as in Locke and Wundt and James, but 
are forces, or things which exert force. This is, of 
course, characteristic of Herbart, and it is the Her- 
bartian philosophy from which Freud, the founder 
of psychoanalysis took his start. To this founda- 
tion Freud added a concept of an ‘‘unconscious”’ 
mind, or unconscious part of the mind: a concept 
tentatively developed by Janet, but, if I am not mis- 
taken, repudiated by Janet after Freud took it 
over. 
What Malebranche and Locke called an ‘‘idea,’’ 
Freud and his followers, in so far as active force 
is attributed to these ideas, have generally called 
“‘wishes.’’ But they have also used the term 
‘‘idea’’ and other similar terms, when the dynamic 
feature of the mental furniture was not to be so 
much emphasized. 
It must be remembered that in the traditional 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  66 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
“idea philosophy,’’ the idea is strictly not the ob- 
servation of something, but the thing observed, al- 
though it is by no means uncommon to slip in the 
other conception illicitly from time to time when 
it serves an argumentative purpose. If these 
‘ideas’’ are, in effect, entities, which can be ob- 
served, why cannot they exist and exercise their 
energies, even when not observed? Here you have 
the foundation of the doctrine of the ‘‘unconscious 
mind’’; that realm in which these ‘‘ideas’’ or 
‘“wishes’’ exist when they are not being observed. 
The psychoanalysts’ conception of the uncon- 
scious mind may best be presented by an illustra- 
tion which Freud himself gave. He likens the mind 
to a town meeting at night in a well lighted hall. 
Certain rowdies present create a disturbance, inter- 
fering with the orderly transaction of business by 
the other persons present. They are accordingly 
ejected to the dark exterior, but they disturb the 
meeting more from outside by yelling and hurling 
bricks through the windows than they did from in- 
side. The rowdies are the ‘‘wishes’’ which have 
been thrust out of the conscious mind into the un- 
conscious. In this condition, they are called ‘‘re- 
pressed wishes,’’ ‘‘repressed ideas,’’ ‘‘repressed de- 
sires,’’ or ‘‘complexes.’’ 
At this point another important concept is intro- 
duced, namely, the concept of repression. The 
‘wishes’’ tend to remain in the lighted room, and
-P-A-G-E-65
    PRESENT DAY SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOLOGY 67 
active force is required to put them into the outer 
darkness. This force or activity is repression. Re- 
pression is, moreover, a continuing activity. The 
wishes do not meekly resign themselves to their 
fate, but constantly struggle to return to conscious- 
ness. Repression, therefore, is not a mere putting 
of the wishes out, but a keeping of them out. The 
activity of repression is sometimes concretely de- 
scribed as the work of the censor: a concept not to 
be taken too realistically, even in the Freudian 
system. But the picture is complete if we repre- 
sent the censor as a sort of policeman or a 
““bouncer.’’ 
It may be said that this schematization is mere 
metaphor, and intended as such. If this were al- 
ways the case, there would be no harm done. There 
is no objection to the construction of allegories. 
But unfortunately, the acceptance of allegories 
usually has an effect on practical belief, and this is 
very decidedly the case here. As a strictly allegor- 
ical formulation, Freudianism vanishes into a 
merely literary field, and this is by no means what 
psychoanalysts aim at. Not only is the allegory 
accepted quite literally from time to time, but prac- 
tical deductions based on it are of high importance 
to the psychoanalysts. Whenever allegory is mixed 
with attempts at science, we become suspicious of 
the resulting mixture, and our suspicions are 
usually justified.
-P-A-G-E-66
  68 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
So far the Freudian system is a mere clever com- 
bination of abandoned parts of old psychological 
machinery. But Freud made certain ingenious 
additions to the machinery in the way of cogs and 
springs, which may have been original with him. 
There has been controversy on this point, but I am 
willing to ignore the controversy and give Freud 
the credit, if credit it be. 
Freud announced that dreams and neurotic symp- 
toms are due to the constant efforts of complexes 
to escape from the unconscious mind and enter the 
conscious mind: or rather, these phenomena are 
due to conflict between the ‘‘complexes’’ and the 
“censor.’’? To make this ingenious scheme work, 
Freud borrowed another notion, this time not from 
the philosophers, but from certain men who might 
be classed as archaeologists or anthropologists. 
This notion was that of symbolism. 
The concept of symbolization is, of course, 
familiar. For our convenience in thinking, and for 
purposes of communication of feeling and thought, 
we employ a concrete object to represent a group 
of objects, a situation, or an abstraction. The 
American flag, for example, symbolizes the nation 
in its various aspects; the cross symbolizes Chris- 
tianity; and a dollar bill symbolizes real money. 
In connection with symbols a group of authors, in- 
eluding Payne Knight, Thomas Inman, and many 
more eminent men, long ago pointed out two things
-P-A-G-E-67
  
PRESENT DAY SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOLOGY 69 
which may be true: first, that many, if not all, of 
our common art forms, and many of our common 
literary expressions were originally symbols with 
distinct and somewhat complicated meanings, which 
meanings have been largely lost; and second, that a 
great deal of this symbolism was sexual, that. is, 
it referred to sexual situations or problems, or more 
frequently referred through these to philosophical 
or religious abstractions. From this point on, these 
older symbolists went rather wild, and recon- 
structed the lost meanings of some of the symbols 
by pure analogy. And Freud, in taking over the 
suggestions these men made, took over also the 
easy method of analogical interpretation and ap- 
plied it to the analysis of dreams. 
The demons of the dark underworld of the mind, 
according to Freud, escape into the light of the 
conscious mind in dreams. During sleep, the light 
is less and the censor nods. But even then, a demon 
cannot get by him, except in disguise: and these 
disguises are symbols. A man who has the uncon- 
scious wish for the death of his father, dreams of 
the death of some man who resembles his father: 
this man being said to symbolize the father: or he 
dreams of his father being in a flower bed, the 
floral setting symbolizing a funeral. The woman 
who has repressed sex desires dreams of her purse 
being empty; or of being very hungry, and so on. 
These repressed desires also interfere with the 
   
-P-A-G-E-68
70 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
processes of waking life, symbolically. If you for- 
get a man’s name, it is because unconsciously you 
have a grudge against him, or associate him with 
some unpleasant past incident. If you lose a pin 
some friend has given you, it is no accident but a 
symbol. Perhaps it means that you would like to 
forget the friend, or to be unfaithful to him. This 
analogical use of symbolization covers the whole 
field of human interests, but its greatest rioting 
ground, of course, is in the field of sex. 
Some of the psychoanalysts treat the symbols 
very elastically, but some, like Freud himself, con- 
ventionalize the symbols so that a certain object, 
or a certain situation, generally symbolizes a par- 
ticular thing, act, or situation. Certain objects you 
dream of symbolize the female sex organs, others 
the male; activities such as flying or falling, sym- 
bolize sex activity. Dreaming of appearing in 
public all too lightly clad symbolizes the wish to 
expose your person beyond the legal limit. One of 
the most astonishing interpretations is recorded by 
Jung. One of his patients dreamed of a certain 
number. By adding in an ingenious way the figures 
for the year, month, and day of birth of the patient, 
of the patient’s wife, his mistress, and his two chil- 
dren, the total gave the number, which is there- 
fore the symbol of the patient’s domestic triangle.

repression of wishes. In arriving at the repressed 
ideas at the basis of these neuroses, the interpreta- 
tion of dreams is much employed, along with inter- 
pretation of the slips and lapses of everyday life, 
and associative processes obtained from the patient. 
The sexual complex looms large in the mechanism 
of Freudianism. Certain stock complexes, such as 
the Edipus or ‘‘mother’’ complex (the sexual de- 
sire of the boy for his mother) ; the Electra complex 
(the desire of the girl for her father) ; homosexual 
and perversional complexes are dug out of the un- 
conscious in profusion. There is no reason, Jung 
tells us, why sex complexes should be in such over- 
whelming majority, but as a matter of fact, they 
are so found, he says. Other types of desire are re- 
pressed, but the sex desire is the chief basis of the 
complexes. Some of the psychoanalysts try to dis- 
guise this situation by claiming that they define 
sex in a broader way than that in which it is com- 
monly used. But I find that in general, when they 
say sex, they seem to really mean sex. 
From this point on, the divergences among the 
psychoanalysts become very great. Some tend to 
find. the mother complex predominating; some find 
other complexes; others try actually to minimize 
the sex factors. The time of origin of the more 
deadly complexes has been pushed from the period 
of puberty back to infancy, and Jung pushes it 
back to the antenatal life. Some have done away
-P-A-G-E-70
  72 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
with wishes and complexes, substituting vaguer 
conceptions, if vaguer conceptions be possible. 
Some eminent psychoanalysts have renounced the 
theory of Freud almost entirely, employing merely 
the general method of delving into the unconscious 
mind by varying procedures. Further development 
of the psychoanalytic doctrine resolves itself into 
description of widely varying schools and in- 
dividual theories, and is therefore outside the pur- 
pose of this paper. 
The only common feature of psychoanalysis to- 
day is the insistence on the unconscious mind and 
its deadly power, and the corollary emphasis of the 
evil of repression. It is, therefore, of these con- 
cepts that I wish to speak in more detail. 
There would be no harm in the concept of the 
unconscious mind if we should remember that it 
is an abstraction, and not a concrete fact. To say 
that a certain phenomenon has a cause in the ‘‘un- 
conscious’’ is merely to say that it undoubtedly has 
a cause, but we don’t know what the cause actually 
is. Our ancestors, in attempting to assign a cause 
for thunder and lightning, said, ‘‘it is the work of 
the God.’’ And that statement is unobjectionable 
if you don’t make the mistake of assuming that it 
is a scientific explanation. In a similar way, when 
the Freudian says that a dream is caused by ‘‘un- 
conscious mind,’’ there would be no objection to the 
statement, if it were not offered as an explanation
-P-A-G-E-71
PRESENT DAY SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOLOGY ‘ie 
  of the dream. Physical science wants to know just 
how thunder and lightning come about, and it has 
made very satisfactory progress in finding out, in 
spite of some objection in the past from theologians. 
So psychology wants to know just how dreams 
come about, and it has made some progress toward 
finding out. But it gets no help from the Freudian 
formulae. The doctrine of the unconscious mind, 
like the doctrine of God, belongs strictly to religion, 
and not to science. 
The psychoanalyst cannot get away from the doc- 
trine of a mind which is a thing: a soul: something 
which has ideas as a tree has leaves, or as a dog has 
fleas. Psychology has abandoned these concepts, 
and deals only with a mind of a purely factual sort, 
namely, the series of acts which the individual 
does, which are popularly designated perceiving, 
thinking, and ‘‘having’’ feelings. That these ac- 
tivities occur is agreed: and psychology studies 
these activities and their laws and conditions. 
These conscious activities constitute the mind, and 
the psychologist therefore has no interest in an 
alleged ‘‘unconscious mind,’’ unless you mean by 
it merely physiological activities. And to these 
activities he prefers to apply the ;perfectly un- 
equivocal term physiological, although he admits 
that they have their effects on the conscious activi- 
ties. Any other ‘‘unconscious mind’’ would be an 
equivalent to ‘‘activities which aren’t active,’’ and
-P-A-G-E-72
  74 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
this paradox the psychologist finds absolutely use- 
less for scientific purposes. 
Perhaps one source of the Freudian confusion has 
been the difficulty of conceiving of a ‘‘capacity’’ 
or ‘‘potentiality’’ as modern scientists view it. If 
a man can solve a problem in calculus, then, ob- 
viously, he had a ‘‘capacity’’ to solve it. But 
really, we mean by ‘‘capacity’’ nothing but an 
abstraction: the fact that the operation can be 
carried out when the proper time comes. 
““Memory”’ does not imply the laying of an ‘‘idea’’ 
away in cold storage for a time, and then later 
bringing it out of the refrigerator. It merely means 
that there is the abstract possibility of thinking 
in a certain way, and that that ‘‘capacity’’ depends 
on previous thinking. But in the interval between 
thinkings, the ‘‘thoughts’’ simply don’t exist. The 
conditions of thinking are closely similar to those 
of billiard playing: you learn to make a shot by 
shooting: but in the intervals between shootings, 
there isn’t any ‘‘shot.’’ 
It is argued: something must exist in the interval 
between shootings, and in the interval between 
thinkings; and this ‘‘something’’ must have been 
modified by the shooting and the thinking in such 
a way as to make the further thinking and shoot- 
ing possible. Well, let us admit that. In the case 
of the shootings, the something is the human body, 
including especially the nervous system. And the
-P-A-G-E-73
PRESENT DAY SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOLOGY 75 
laws of learning are so nearly similar in the two 
cases that modern psychologists conclude with in- 
creasing assurance that in the one case as in the 
other, the nervous system and modifications in it 
are the connecting links. In so far as a capacity 
for thinking, feeling, or perceiving exists as a con- 
crete fact, it is a disposition of the nervous system 
and nothing else of which science can take ac- 
count. But we know little as yet concerning the 
nervous system, and the acquisition of greater in- 
formation concerning it is one of the least impor- 
tant problems of psychology. In the case of dreams, 
for example, we want to know what preceding de- 
tails of thinking and feeling and perceiving have 
occurred, together with the stimulation now play- 
ing upon the dreamer, to produce the thinking, feel- 
ing, and perceiving in this dream. In fact, until 
we know such causal, relations thoroughly, we shall 
not be able to know the details of the actions of 
the nervous mechanism which make the causal rela- 
tion possible. And we have by painstaking ac- 
quisition already a lot of information about the 
mental life, because we have resolutely refused to 
be satisfied with empty formulae such as the ‘‘un- 
conscious mind.’’? The unfortunate feature of psy- 
choanalysis is not the theory of the unconscious 
per se, but the fact that the theory as held inhibits 
the scientific curiosity of those who hold it. 
T cannot leave the subject of psychoanalysis with- 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  76 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
out commenting on one of the unfortunate practical 
points which has come out of the mass of foolish 
theory, and that point concerns repression. Re- 
pression is the Freudian term for the attempt to 
forget or ignore unpleasant things, or to withdraw 
the attention from desires which are unethical or 
whose satisfaction is inadvisable. And we are told 
that repression is bad, and parents and teachers 
are urged to teach children not to repress. 
Nothing could be more vicious or absurd than 
this doctrine, if we take it seriously. Actual re- 
pression is the only salvation of man if civilization 
is to continue, and the ability to repress effectively 
is the greatest asset a human individual can have. 
It is true that constant struggle is bad, and the 
struggler needs aid in repressing. But nothing is 
more weakening than to keep thinking of past mis- 
takes and illicit desires. In particular, the adoles- 
cent boy and girl need to have their attention 
drawn away from the surging desire of sex and 
turned in other directions. And it is just those 
features of the movies and other details of modern 
life which interfere with the repressions which are 
most deplorable. 
The treatment of the mentally distressed and 
struggling is a vast problem for the psychologist 
and the psychiatrist. Many features of the prac- 
tice of the priest and psychoanalyst are good: con- 
fession, sympathy, new direction of attention, ex- 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
  
PRESENT DAY SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOLOGY pee 
pert advice, these are the factors which have made 
the success of priest, physician, and psychiatrist. 
But they succeed best when unhampered by mytho- 
logical notions, and when guided by knowledge 
of human nature. On the other hand, the evil re- 
sults of bungling attempts to work with these 
patients are matters of observation. One has but 
to see and examine some of the patients who have 
been through the mill of treatment by psycho- 
analysts to follow the theories strictly, to be im- 
pressed with the danger of that mill. Fortunately 
.many of the practicing psychoanalysts, so-called, 
use good common sense and everyday psychology, 
and are no more Freudian than I am. 
So far as I can make out at the present time, 
Freud and his disciples have contributed nothing of 
value to psychology, and if they have contributed 
anything to medicine, it is rather discreditable to 
medicine to have been so far behind the progress 
of psychology that it could profit by this mixture 
of psychology and superstition. 
Turning now from the speculations which the 
philosophers, aided by the medical men, have in- 
jected into psychology, we come finally to a spec- 
ulative movement of great proportion into which 
the philosophers and biologists have carried the 
psychologist. For many years the conceptions of 
instinct and intelligence have been used as op- 
posed to each other, or at least as complementary.  
-P-A-G-E-76
  78 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
The actual significance of each of these terms has 
varied from time to time, and from theorist to 
theorist, and as a result, discussions concerning the 
relative part played by these two in the life of man 
and the lower animals have been rather profitless. 
Modern psychology has become rather cautious in 
the use of these terms, and by a rather general con- 
census of opinion now uses the term ‘‘instinct’’ 
as an abstraction, covering the fact that the various 
reactions of which an animal is capable have a basis 
in heredity, and that the animal is therefore to a 
certain extent predisposed to certain lines of ac- 
tion upon certain stimulations; predisposed through 
the normal growth and development of the organ- 
ism itself. Intelligence, also, is used as an abstract 
term, to indicate the fact that these hereditary 
tendencies are modified, in many cases at least, 
through the experience of the animal; in other 
words, that the animal learns. It has been ad- 
mitted, therefore, that no action is the result of in- 
telligence alone: that however much learning there 
may have been in the development of the reaction, 
such learning always has a basis in innate tenden- 
cies. It has not been so generally admitted that no 
action is purely instinctive, but the present ten- 
dency in American psychology is in that direction. 
The complicated actions of the child in sucking 
milk from the breast of the mother have very fre- 
quently been described as purely instinctive. The
-P-A-G-E-77
  PRESENT DAY SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOLOGY 79 
child, when first applied to the breast, has ap- 
parently had no chance to learn the nicely coor- 
dinated complex reaction by the numerous muscles 
involved: the coordination has therefore been sup- 
posed to be ‘‘instinctive.’’ At present, on the basis 
of our fuller knowledge of the various factors in- 
volved in learning, we very seriously doubt the 
merely instinctive character of this performance, 
and there is a growing interest in the study of the 
prenatal life of the child, with a view to determin- 
ing the course of development of its reaction ten- 
dencies. Even in the case of the bees, ants, and 
wasps, the actual relations of ‘‘instinct’’ and ‘‘in- 
telligence’’ are now not believed to be so simple as 
they once seemed. 
The tendency towards an abstract use of the term 
‘“instinet’’ is, however, a rather recent development. 
There has been in the past a very prevalent use of 
the term in a concrete sense, as if it indicated a 
specific force, or specific assemblage of forces. We 
have been accustomed to hearing about ‘‘instincts’’ 
in the plural, including the ‘‘reproductive instinct,’’ 
the ‘‘pugnacious instinct,’ the ‘‘gregarious in- 
stinct,’? and many others. This usage was prev- 
alent even four years ago, and the ‘‘instincts’”’ as 
concrete facts were so generally accepted that there 
was much speculation as to the exact number and 
nature of the human ‘‘instincts,’’ and the exact 
relation between an ‘‘instinct’’ and a mere reflex
-P-A-G-E-78
  80 oLp AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
act. Psychologists took the ‘‘instincts’’ so seriously 
that they were in the habit of pointing out the 
necessity of using the term carefully, and protested 
against the ‘‘loose’’ usage of popular writers and 
speakers who created a ‘‘religious instinct’? a 
‘political instinct,’’ an ‘‘artistic instinct’’ or any 
other instincts they happened to need. But of late 
interest in these distinctions has waned at an as- 
tonishing rate. 
Although ‘‘instinct’’ has been a serious topic for 
psychological consideration, the rise of an instinet- 
psychology, in which the concretely conceived in- 
stincts were made the basis for a whole psycho- 
logical theory, was definitely due to McDougall. 
Many psychologists had worked out lists of in- 
stinets, ranging from the familiar pair of ‘‘self- 
preservative’’ and ‘‘reproductive,’’? up to the in- 
definitely long list of Thorndike. But none of these 
psychologists had had the notion of founding a 
psychology on such a list, although Thorndike per- 
haps came near to it. We may reasonably, there- 
fore, call McDougall’s psychological theory, as he 
has developed it during the last twenty years, 
the instinet-psychology. 
I suppose that McDougall has made in total as 
great a contribution to the science as any living 
psychologist, and although certain other psychol- 
ogists have made contributions which are more 
important than any one of McDougall’s, yet the 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
  PRESENT DAY SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOLOGY 81 
number and range of contributions would give 
McDougall high rank. But, as a matter of fact, 
McDougall is not so well known to the public 
through his contributions to scientific psychology 
as he is through the instinct theory which he has 
elaborated. 
McDougall views the instinct, not as an abstrac- 
tion, but as a concrete force, which expresses it- 
self in bodily activity, but which cannot be defined 
in terms of reactions or bodily activities. From his 
earlier writings, he has sometimes been understood 
to mean by ‘‘instinet’’ the emotional state which 
accompanies instinctive activity. But in his last 
book he makes it clear that such is not his mean- 
ing. The instinct is definable only in terms of pur- 
poses, and purposes are apparently not due to 
physiological mechanisms, nor dependent on ex- 
ternal stimulation, but are original activities of the 
soul. As might be expected, McDougall alligns him- 
self philosophically with the vitalists, and heartily 
condemns the point of view from which instincts 
are considered as abstractions, labeling that view as 
‘mechanistic. ’’ 
“The general disposition of scientific psychology 
today is to leave the debate over vitalism and 
mechanism to the philosophers and philosophical 
biologists, refusing to let the question trouble our 
psychological work, and refraining from basing our 
interpretations on either assumption. Most of us, 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  82 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
I am sure, would as bitterly resent being classed as 
mechanists as we would being classed as vitalists: 
at any rate, we would deny that such classification 
has any more importance for psychology than our 
classification as republicans or democrats. But for 
McDougall, this is an important matter, and we 
must remember that he bases his psychology on 
principles which he declares are anti-mechanistic, 
that is, vitalistic. He goes even further than this, 
and declares his belief in a soul, which actually 
functions in psychological activity, and as I now 
understand him, the various instincts are the sev- 
eral ways in which the soul expresses itself in 
the bodily life. These instincts are modified in 
their expression by habit-formation, and by stimu- 
lation from the environment; but throughout these 
modifications of experience each instinct remains 
forever the same, and distinct from all the others. 
If I may give an analogy which is my own, not 
McDougall’s, I can say that the instinct is like elec- 
tricity, which may be shunted here, or shunted 
there, may express itself now in rotary motion, now 
in lighting the lamp filament, and now in the flar- 
ing are; but remaining in all its manifestations the 
same energy. 
The implications of this theory were first de- 
veloped by McDougall in social psychology, and 
only recently in general psychology. And the social 
development was received, in America at least, with  
-P-A-G-E-81
PRESENT DAY SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOLOGY 83 
great enthusiasm and has had an extended vogue 
during the last fifteen years. McDougall’s text- 
book, Social Psychology, has run through thirteen 
editions, and has been widely used in courses in 
psychology, education, sociology, and ethics. 
The reasons for the popularity of the instinct 
psychology are twofold. First, McDougall’s book 
was the first social psychology written by a psy- 
chologist. Psychologists had entertained the view 
that there was such a thing as social psychology, 
but no one had, been able to pin it down. The texts 
offered by sociologists, historians, and political 
theorists were sometimes interesting, but they 
weren’t psychology. Second, the details in the 
working out of McDougall’s scheme fitted in well 
with the conventional discussion of instinct; and the 
majority of those who used or approved the book 
didn’t understand McDougall’s theory at all, but 
supposed he meant by instinct what Thorndike and 
some other psychologists meant by it. Dewey, for 
example, had this impression, and proclaimed that 
Thorndike and McDougall had at last put social 
psychology on the scientific foundation of the in- 
stincts. 
The formal use of the instinct hypothesis is, of 
course, obvious. If you want to explain some social 
phenomenon such as war, you refer it to an in- 
stinct. There is a ‘‘pugnacious instinct’’; and 
there you have an explanation. This line of ex-
-P-A-G-E-82
  84 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
planation is more impressive when you adopt Mc- 
Dougall’s conception of instincts, but it also satis- 
fies many who have used the term in a looser and 
vaguer way. 
The instinct psychology is, in effect, another 
manifestation of the same tendency which is ex- 
hibited in the old faculty psychology, and in the 
Freudian system: a tendency into which we all 
drop from time to time and which requires constant 
circumspection to keep out of. You notice a cer- 
tain common characteristic in a group of phe- 
nomena; then you abstract that characteristic, give 
it a name, and explain the phenomena by saying 
they are manifestations of that abstraction you have 
named. The faculty psychology explained cogni- 
tion or knowing by saying that it was the work of 
the cognitive faculty: a statement which may be 
good description, but which is not explanation. The 
old phlogiston theory of the physicists was another 
instance of this type of verbal explanation. So, 
the instinct psychology, noting that certain acts 
are involved in fighting, or lead to fighting, desig- 
nates this common feature as pugnacity, and ex- 
plains the actions as expressions of the ‘‘pugnacious 
instinet.’’ The instinct, in short, rapidly became 
a venerated icon in psychology, accepted by intro- 
spectionalists, behaviorists, and common, or garden 
psychologists alike; and was believed in, in as great 
a variety of forms as is usually the case with icons,
-P-A-G-E-83
PRESENT DAY SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOLOGY 85 
until a stone the present writer hurled at it in 1919 
precipitated a general disturbance, and the instinct 
became not only repudiated, but execrated. In 
plain language, the instinct is now not only very 
generally rejected as an explanatory concept, but 
is, by some extremists, repudiated even as a useful 
abstraction, which is unfortunate. 
The more practical point of view which is rapidly 
gaining ground is best stated by reference to the 
critical terms. ‘‘Instinct’’ is a useful abstract term, 
referring to the undoubtedly innate or hereditary 
basis of all reactions and activity. When we wish 
to emphasize the hereditary basis of any reaction 
we refer to it as ‘‘instinctive,’’? but we do not as- 
sume that any action of an animal after emerging 
from the uterus or hatching from the egg is purely 
instinctive. If any such are, the fact remains to be 
demonstrated. As for the ‘‘instincts’’ in the plural, 
we admit that they are arbitrary classifications of 
actions, at best classifications made to suit the pur- 
pose of the psychologist, and subject to reclassi- 
fication when such reclassification is practically con- 
venient. They may be useful for reference, but no 
more ‘‘explain’’ psychological phenomena than a 
filing system in the office of an insurance company 
explains the business of insurance. 
In so far as it is convenient to discuss the activi- 
ties of human beings in terms of two instincts, then 
there are two. But if it is more convenient to dis- 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  86 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
cuss human activities in terms of 57 instincts, then 
there are 57. The term instinct means nothing 
more than this in the actual facts of psychology, 
and the hypothesis of an ‘‘instinct’’ of a casual 
‘sort belongs, like the Freudian ‘‘unconscious’’ to 
the field of religion, not of science. 
The author of Ecclesiastes, and other pessimists 
have described life as a series of vicissitudes. But 
in spite of the ills which flesh is heir to, we do grow 
up. And so does psychology. The crises of intro- 
spectionalism, of behaviorism, of Freudianism, of 
instinctivism, have been passed successively, and in 
fact rapidly. Speculative theory is, after all, a side 
issue in psychology, and the scientific method of 
tentative working hypotheses and experimental 
tests prevails. In the great field of general psychol- 
ogy as well as individual psychology we deal with 
facts, and as the science of psychology becomes 
more and more distinct and unified, the theoretical 
problems which the other sciences thrust upon us 
become less and less conspicuous. But at present, 
the psychologist needs to be somewhat skilled in 
speculation in order to avoid it efficiently.
-P-A-G-E-85
  CHAPTER IIT 
PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS IN 
SPIRITUALISM 
According to the opinions of many interested per- 
sons, a great wave of spiritualism, and revival of 
interest in the occult in general, has swept over 
England and America in the last few years. 
Whether this is quite the case or not, I am not 
sure. It may be like the reported increase in bow- 
leggedness among our young girls, which is not due 
to any intrinsic change in the form of the nether 
limbs, but merely to an increased willingness to dis- 
play to the public gaze that which was sedulously 
concealed a decade ago. I myself am inclined to 
believe that there is no greater interest in spiritual- 
ism, and no greater tendency on the part of the 
public to accept the reputed phenomena and proofs 
of the occult, than there has been for the last thirty 
years or more; but that there is now less hesitancy 
over the admission of interest, and less fear of the 
results of confession of faith. 
However this may be, the present situation is 
one of great interest to the psychologist, since it 
offers the chance of adding to our knowledge of 
human nature, and since it may also afford an op- 
portunity for real social service in the way of work 
87
-P-A-G-E-86
  88 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
in mental hygiene. It is clear that if any positive 
help in the situation is possible, such help must 
come from the psychologist. 
Three phases of the problem which confronts us 
are especially important, and I shall restrict my 
discussion to these three phases, without attempt- 
ing, in the limits of my time, to consider the larger 
and more ultimate questions to which these three 
phases may be related. The three phases I have 
selected may be indicated by three queries. 
(1) Why are people in general so eager to ac- 
cept the claims of spiritualists, in spite of the facts 
that (a) these claims have not been authenticated, 
and (b) if these claims were authenticated, they 
would throw very little light on the question of 
immortality? 
(2) How is it possible that some men of good 
reputation, in certain fields of science, can endorse 
the claims of spiritualists if these claims have really 
no scientific backing? 
(8) Are any of the mediums sincere in their 
claims regarding the origin of their messages; or, 
in other words: is it possible that they may be 
themselves deluded? 
In considering these queries, it is advantageous 
to take the second one first. 
If we run over the list of scientific men who have 
openly accepted the claims of spiritualism in some 
measure, we find that it includes principally mathe-
-P-A-G-E-87
  
  PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS IN SPIRITUALISM 89 
maticians, physicists, and astronomers, with some 
workers in lines such as engineering, which are 
closely allied to these sciences. The scientific pro- 
ponents of spiritualism whose names will first occur 
to the average person are: Crookes, Lodge and 
Barrett—physicists; Crawford — engineer; and 
Flammarion—astronomer. If you go farther in the 
investigation of personnel, you will find more men 
from these classes, with a few medical men of little 
eminence scientifically or professionally, and prac- 
tically no psychologists or biologists. One thinks 
of course of William James and Alfred Russel Wal- 
lace in the past: both brilliant men, and both given 
to speculative interests rather than research. Per- 
haps James was converted in his old age: I do 
not know where he really stood, although he was 
keenly interested in spiritualistic phenomena. But 
it is a striking thing that one ean find in the past 
only an occasional psychologist mildly committed to 
spiritualism, and find only one among living re- 
search psychologists: while practically all the 
scientific men who stand before the world as be- 
lievers in spirit communications or in telepathy or 
other occult phenomena, are in the ranks of phy- 
sical science. 
I do not mean to imply that the majority, or even 
a large minority of physicists, mathematicians, and 
astronomers are believers in the occult. On the 
contrary, the number of those who accept the occult
-P-A-G-E-88
90 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
  are relatively few. Yet it is a matter of great im- 
portance that practically all who do accept it, and 
who can be classed as scientists, do come from these 
ranks. It is my observation further, that among 
workers in science whose names are not known to 
the general public, the same rule holds, and that 
the believers in the occult are found almost with- 
out exception among the physical group. 
The importance of this fact cannot be lightly set 
aside, when it is proclaimed that eminent men of 
science accept telepathy, spirit-communications, or 
_telekinesis: for in it is to be found the explanation 
of that which misleads the public. Science is a 
highly specialized field, and the training a man re- 
ceives in one department does not necessarily fit 
him for work in another department. The training 
of the specialist in mathematics and physics does 
not directly fit him for work in such fields as that 
of psychology, although it gives an excellent 
foundation for such training. In fact, the more 
intensively he specializes in mathematical physics, 
the less likely he is to obtain training in psychology. 
Moreover, being for years accustomed to the 
handling of data which can be treated with mathe- 
matical precision, and habituated to the observa- 
tion of phenomena which can be repeated at will 
under rigid control and subjected to mechanical 
analysis, he is at a distinct disadvantage when he 
turns to the consideration of the phenomena of
-P-A-G-E-89
PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS IN SPIRITUALISM 91 
living organisms, where different methods and dif- 
ferent techniques are required and where so many 
of the factors cannot be controlled. In these cases 
is demanded the training and the skill of the psy- 
chologist, accustomed to the observation of phe- 
nomena whose regulation and laboratory control is 
difficult, and to the handling of data which cannot 
be mathematically treated. 
The worker in physical science, moreover, is 
habituated to the trusting of his sense perception 
with very simple corrective processes, and to re- 
liance on the observations of others. His training 
in these lines is therefore a negative, rather than a 
positive asset, and in the study of many of the 
phenomena of human behavior, he is just so much 
handicapped. 
I do not mean that the physicist is necessarily in- 
competent to make psychological observations; on 
the contrary many physicists, from Helmholtz 
down, have been highly qualified in this direction. 
But this is not because of their technical skill in 
physics, but rather in spite of it, and because they 
have also cultivated skill in methods other than 
those of physics. 
In short, the training of the physicist and the 
mathematician does not fit him for the work of a 
detective or that of a psychological observer, and 
does not guarantee his opinions on matters con- 
nected with these lines; but rather raises a presump- 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  92 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
tion against him. This the public does not under- 
stand, and therefore the public supposes that be- 
cause a certain individual has an international 
reputation in mathematical physics, his judgment 
on matters of international law, or internal medi- 
cine, or spiritualism, is worth more than that of the 
average educated man. Which, of course, it is not. 
The best combination for investigation in psy- 
chical research would be the joint work of a trained 
psychologist and a Burns detective. Both of these 
are trained to deal with human behavior, though 
in somewhat different ways. Failing this combina- 
tion, the psychologist alone may be employed, and, 
if he is not available, a keen, hard-headed business 
man should take the job. 
The consideration of the appeal of psychic re- 
search to the ‘‘scientist’’ is therefore not a topic 
which we need to consider apart from the general 
appeal to the public. After all, the scientists to 
whom spiritualism and other occult theories have 
appealed, are in these respects precisely on the level 
of the general public, and their opinions are, if any- 
thing, less important than those of business men, 
manufacturers, and politicians. It is a sad fact 
that men who achieve in some one line a success 
that makes their judgment in matters belonging 
to that line exceptionally weighty often delude 
themselves in the belief that their opinions in other 
lines are also weighty. Unfortunately the public 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
  
PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS IN SPIRITUALISM 93 
is frequently ready to share the delusion. This 
should be a lesson to all of us. 
In considering why the public, or a certain por- 
tion of it, accepts the spiritualist’s claims, when the 
expert investigators of these claims do not—and 
we must remember that psychologists, with the lone 
exception of McDougall, accept neither spirit com- 
munications nor telepathy—we must emphasize the 
fact that the attempts to demonstrate the reality of 
the phenomena which the spiritualists claim have 
never resulted in any scientific proof. 
It is true that the late W. J. Crawford, a mechan- 
ical engineer in Belfast, whom I mentioned, has 
published elaborate results of investigations on a 
medium through whose agency tables were lifted 
in a mysterious way, and that his conclusions were 
that no ordinary explanation would suffice for these 
phenomena. It is also true, however, that Dr. Craw- 
ford’s methods of investigation, which he details 
with great care, were defective at just the essential 
points of such investigations, and that Dr. Craw- 
ford’s suicide apparently followed his discovery 
that he had been deceived in a humiliating way by 
his medium. If you consider the cases cited by 
Sir Oliver Lodge, or Dr. Funk, or any of the serious, 
unskilled investigators of mediums, you will find 
in all cases that information is lacking on just the 
points which are most vital. And you will find al- 
so that in every investigation in which a trained 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  \ 
94 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
psychologist has control, the claims of the spiritual- 
ists are not substantiated. 
There are several reasons why unskilled investi- 
gators obtain deceptive results. In the first place, 
the unreliability of testimony, so well known to the 
lawyer and the psychologist, is seldom taken into 
consideration. In his investigations into the cele- 
brated case of the ‘‘Rhode Island girl,’’ Miinster- 
berg found that several witnesses of a certain test 
had sworn before a notary to a statement concern- 
ing a vital point: but upon being confronted with 
further evidence, they all admitted that the state- 
ment was false. The reason they accepted the false 
statement in the first place was that they did not 
know that the point involved was of any im- 
portance. 
Only recently there came to my attention a fresh 
illustration of the fallacies in this sort of testimony. 
One of my students, having attended the perform- 
ance of a professional prestidigitator, reported posi- 
tively to me the next day that the clairvoyant this 
professional exhibited had described correctly an 
object in the pocket of the student, which object 
was neither seen by, nor described to, the presti- 
digitator or his clairvoyant. He reported also that 
the clairvoyant read correctly questions which per- 
sons had written and sealed before coming to the 
theater, and which did not leave the possession of 
the writers. Knowing that neither of these feats
-P-A-G-E-93
  
PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS IN SPIRITUALISM 95 
had ever been performed before competent wit- 
nesses, I cross-examined the student, but failed to 
shake his testimony. I then went myself to witness 
a performance of this professional and his clairvoy- 
ant, and found that they did neither of the feats 
reported, but exhibited the good old tricks ina way 
differing but slightly from the traditional methods. 
The question therefore arises: if testimony is so 
unreliable, how can we acquire any evidence what- 
ever? And the answer is: we can acquire it only 
in the way in which evidence is obtained in all 
scientific work; by employing trained observers who 
have prepared themselves in advance to observe 
certain phases of the occurrence, and to judge 
whether certain definite things do or do not happen. 
The difference between casual testimony and 
scientific report can be illustrated from the running 
down of a pedestrian by an automobile at a street 
crossing. If an accident of this sort has occurred, 
the testimony of casual witnesses as to whether the 
chauffeur sounded his horn at a certain moment, or 
whether the unfortunate pedestrian turned back 
after starting across the street, is subject to grave 
error, and must be carefully checked by other cir- 
cumstances, if admitted at all. If, however, such 
an event were deliberately prearranged, and wit- 
nesses posted to observe whether certain details 
should or should not occur, being definitely pre- 
pared to watch for these details, the testimony 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
    96 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
would be found to have a high degree of reliability. 
This is precisely the sort of observation which is 
made in scientific work, and the skill of the scientist 
consists in the ability to analyze problems and de- 
cide upon the possible details for which to look, as 
well as in specific training in observing. 
Unskilled analysis of occult phenomena usually 
goes astray because of ignorance of the important 
points. The observer is not watching a particular 
detail of the performance, because he does not know 
that that detail is important: hence his subsequent 
report, when questioned concerning that detail, has 
little value. 
It is sometimes true that a little knowledge is a 
dangerous thing. There are many different trick 
slates with which slate-writing is done. I have 
had six different types of slate in my hands, and 
there are still more. An investigator who is 
familiar with one or two of the methods or slates, 
is frequently unable to detect the trick when done 
some other way, because he is watching for the par- 
ticular trick with which he is familiar, and over- 
looks the one employed. This, however, is merely 
a special case of ignorance of what to look for. 
Somewhat the same conditions apply to the familiar 
mind-reading stunt as done on the vaudeville cir- 
cuit, for the performances of which there are a nym- 
ber of different devices. 
The investigator of so-called psychic phenomena
-P-A-G-E-95
PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS IN SPIRITUALISM 97 
needs to be familiar with the general field of sleight 
of hand, and technical mechanical devices employed 
by professional mediums and prestidigitators: and 
he needs to be keenly aware that new tricks and 
new methods are constantly being devised. (There 
are, or were before the war, two concerns in the 
United States which did nothing but manufacture 
appliances for the use of magicians and mediums.) 
The investigator must in addition possess a large 
fund of information in the field of psychology, par- 
ticularly in regard to the physiological bases of con- 
scious processes, or he will not go far. It is suf- 
ficient to say that in every case in which such a 
competent investigator has been allowed to examine 
fully into alleged phenomena of spirit communica- 
tion, telepathy, or telekinesis, the result has been 
the discrediting of the medium’s claims. A striking 
instance was the investigation of Husapia Palidino, 
who mystified the physicists, anthropologists, and 
laymen of Europe and America, but who collapsed 
completely as soon as American psychologists con- 
ducted the investigations. 
I will be asked, of course: ‘‘Well, then, how do 
you explain such a case as this?’’ and then will fol- 
low a tale of a dream that came true: a table that 
lifted without hands or feet: a sealed letter read: 
a message written on a sealed slate: a person’s 
name spoken by a medium at first sight: or some 
other instance from an endless list of miraculous
-P-A-G-E-96
  98 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY — 
oceurrences in which so many people believe. Of 
course, we don’t try to explain them. We know 
that there is no proof of such events having hap- 
pened. Hither something essential has been omitted 
in the account, or something added, or both. We 
know this because, in the first place, no such events 
happen when a psychologist is around and on the 
job, and because in so far as it has been possible 
to go back over such reported cases and investigate, 
critical errors of the sort mentioned are always 
found. We face the situation, therefore, in which 
we are asked to believe a miraculous thing because 
we can’t investigate it to prove it false, although 
every case of the sort which has been investigated 
has been found false. We cannot accept such 
miracles without admitting that the methods of 
science are wrong from top to bottom, and that 
there is no known method of obtaining true knowl- 
edge. We cannot admit that, because the actual 
achievements of scientific method in many direc- 
tions are the proef of its value. 
This is not the place in which to engage in a 
prolonged exposition of the methods of science. It 
suffices to say that in regard to so-called psychic 
phenomena, science makes the same demands that 
it makes throughout its whole field: it demands 
the same sort of evidence here that it demands of 
. Einstein’s theory, or the theory that bubonic plague 
is transmitted by fleas, or the claim that benzyl

  PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS IN SPIRITUALISM 99 
benzoate will relax the muscles of the intestines: 
it demands a statement of the conditions under 
which the phenomena described can be observed by 
properly trained observers, and on none of these 
or any other points will accept mere anecdote or 
casual testimony, although it might be sworn to 
before a battallion of notaries. 
Leaving out the consideration of telepathy and 
of telekinesis, and confining ourselves to the sub- 
ject of spirit communications alone: We find, 
further, that even.if we should grant that a selected 
part, if not all, of the communications which have 
been made by mediums, really come from ‘‘spirits,’’ 
we would know little about what a ‘‘spirit’”’ is, and 
nothing at all, from this source, about the continua- 
tion of individual personal existence beyond the 
grave. 
Suppose we admit that the medium gets informa- 
tion from some source, and that the information 
is sometimes true: what then? What is the source? 
Suppose we grant as much as could be made out 
from the data presented, namely, that the source 
of the information is in some way connected with 
an individual who once lived, but is now dead. Is 
that person still living in the same old way? Or is 
merely some effect of his having lived, which is still 
reverberating in the universe? If we should grant 
everything the spiritualists claim as to the genuine- 
ness of their data, it tells us nothing whatever on 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  100 oLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
this point. If we study the character of the alleged 
spirit communications, and note the stupidity of 
large parts of them: the vagueness and incoherence 
of other parts: the manifest errors of others: and 
the very rare gleams of apparent sound intelligence 
and useful information: we cannot but compare 
the condition of the reputed ‘‘spirit’’ with the con- 
dition of senile decay in life. Just so the valetu- 
dinarian dodders and rambles, forgets and contra- 
dicts himself, with occasional gleams of sound 
sense. If we do not adopt the hypothesis that the 
person has ceased to exist, and merely left behind 
some effects of his previous existence: if we hold 
that his personality, or some fragment of it still 
exists, somewhere, somehow: then we must con- 
clude that it is a pitifully decaying personality, 
disintegrating into mental chaos: a rotting ghost 
over which it were better to draw the veil of 
oblivion. If, therefore, we believe in the real im- 
mortality of the personal self, and believe that there 
is a value in that immortality, the acceptance of the 
discredited ‘‘evidence’’ of the spiritualists is a 
deadly blow to our belief. 
Yet, in spite of the facts, a large group of the 
naive public, including Sir Oliver Lodge, avidly ac- 
cepts the claims of the spiritualists. And this is a 
situation that we are called upon to explain. 
It might be said that the cause is the general 
human tendency of man to accept any striking and
-P-A-G-E-99
    
PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS IN SPIRITUALISM 101 
picturesque claim, concerning the impossibility of 
which he has no clear understanding. And we 
might point to the eager acceptance of political 
nostrums, of new and strange religions, and of 
popular philosophies of divers kinds. I might even 
point to the fact that recently, men of reputed in- 
telligence in my community, even university pro- 
fessors, have bought stock in an oil venture which 
has not the slightest evidence of soundness. 
Against such a general explanation, however, we 
must point out a profound and often perverse 
scepticism on the part of the public towards new 
ideas and new projects, even when these novelties 
are strongly supported evidentially. Witness the 
past scepticism towards flying machines and 
towards wireless telegraphy, which was exhibited 
even by some of the very individuals who so eagerly 
accept spiritualism, and was tenaciously maintained 
until the last possibility of holding it was swept 
away: Witness the scepticism towards the need of 
tax reforms,—and I might add, towards the League 
of Nations. Obviously, there is no simple tendency 
to believe in theories just because they are pre- 
sented for belief. 
In credulous belief, there is involved something 
more specific, namely: a powerful drive of an emo- 
tional sort. In the absence of scientific principles, 
man. believes that which he strongly desires to be- 
lieve. He believes in the miraculous oil well be-
-P-A-G-E-100
  102 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
cause he is told it will make him rich, and because 
he wants very much to be rich. He believes in the 
statements of spiritualism, because he is told that 
these statements make it certain that he will live 
after death—and he very much wants to feel cer- 
tain that he will live after death. 
The author of a book published in 1918 expressed 
this very well, although we must assume that he 
did not clearly know that he was expressing it. 
The author is Conan Doyle, and the book is The 
New Revelation: the first public confession by the 
creator of Sherlock Holmes that he had become con- 
verted to spiritualism. In the first paragraph of 
the first chapter of that book, Conan Doyle says: 
“The subject of psychical research is one upon which I 
have thought more and about which I have been slower to 
form my opinion, than upon any other subject whatever. 
Every now and then, as one jogs along through life some 
small incident happens which very forcibly brings home 
the fact that time passes and that first youth and then 
middle age are slipping away.’’ 
The significance of this passage is strikingly 
clear. The author has been aroused to the fact that 
he is growing old: that death is approaching—the 
apparent end of all his values. He does not want 
to die: he wants to live: and as death approaches, 
he wants some certainty that he will continue to 
live beyond it. Hence, in the absence of any other 
source of certainty, he must accept the claims of
-P-A-G-E-101
  PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS IN SPIRITUALISM 103 
spiritualism. And you will find in his later writ- 
ings that the life after death in which he finds be- 
lief is precisely the sort of life which he values most 
highly now, and which he wants to continue. 
It is a remarkable thing, that whereas the mil- 
lions of inhabitants of India fear immortality, and 
seek for means by which to escape it, millions in 
Europe and in America desire immortality most 
deeply, and seek for the assurance that they will 
possess it. One of the great functions of Western 
religion has been to convey this assurance, just as 
one of the great functions of Hindu religion has 
been to convey the assurance that life can be termi- 
nated, or if not terminated, can be made perpetually 
unconscious. In default of traditional religion— 
and traditional religion has lost its compelling 
power for many in the West, even for many who 
wear the vestments of the church—something else 
must be the life buoy: and that something else 
which supplies the need for assurance against death 
may be Christian Science or spiritualism. 
The lusty youth and the vigorous maiden, revel- 
ing in the full possession of energies and faculties, 
may be interested in spiritualism as in palmistry, or 
cotillions, or moving pictures: as a source of amuse- 
ment, or of thrills, or even of delightful awe. But 
your true devotee is the man or woman of failing 
faculties, and decreasing energies, who sees ap- 
proaching inevitably the time when the golden  
-P-A-G-E-102
  104 oLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
bowl shall be broken, and the silver cord loosed: 
when the wheel shall be broken at the fountain and 
the pitcher at the cistern; when the almond tree 
shall blossom and the grasshopper become a bur- 
den: when the sound of the grinding shall be low, 
and those that look out of windows be darkened; 
and when at last the mourners shall go about the 
streets. Such a one, seeing that dread day surely 
approaching, when that life which was so wonderful 
in youth, and which even now is so dear, is about to 
be snuffed out like the flame of the spent candle, 
and lacking the secure confidence of traditional reli- 
gious belief, grasps frantically at even the poor piti- 
ful straw of psychic research, and shuts his eyes to 
its futility and insufficiency. 
To have the force of these facts borne upon you, 
you need only to attend spiritualistic séances, with 
your eyes open. I have seen the tables tip—and I 
have shown how they are tipped; I have watched 
the ouija board cavort; I have seen the medium 
retire to her cabinet, and seen the spooks come forth 
from it: I have seen the written message come from 
the medium’s pen, and I have heard her dictate 
what the ‘‘spirits’’ have spoken to her; and I have 
had her revelations given to me in private sittings 
for cold cash. And in all this, the thing that has 
impressed me most is that people believe because 
they want to believe. 
I have listened to the professional medium while  
-P-A-G-E-103
  PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS IN SPIRITUALISM 105 
she gave me vague information about estates to be 
settled: ‘‘papers’’ to be signed; friends and rela- 
tives ‘‘gone over.’* Resisting the tendency to rise 
to her clever fishing and give her the information 
to give back to me, I have realized how easily, if T 
wanted to believe, I could get proofs: how by easy 
interpretation of the guesses I received, I could 
piece out a message; how easy it is to forget the 
things that don’t ‘‘strike oil,’’ and emphasize other 
things; and above all, how little dependence can be 
placed on the story a sitter tells me of what the 
medium actually told him, and what he told her. 
A sitter who is sufficiently ignorant, or who is suf- 
ficiently anxious to believe, can be profoundly im- 
pressed by the medium without her having need of 
recourse to the great card index system which is 
maintained in the United States, and in which you 
are listed, with all the information obtainable from 
Who’s Who and many other sources, if you once 
gave your name to a medium belonging to the as- 
sociation. 
I have watched one of the most widely known of 
the amateur mediums at work, with a private audi- 
ence of sixty or more persons present: and I have 
marveled at the simplicity with which the desired 
interpretations are put upon the communications 
received, and the little cleverness or finesse required 
to put them over on an audience wishful to be con-  
-P-A-G-E-104
  106 oLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
vinced of their other-worldly origin. Perhaps an 
illustration or two will make my point clear. 
This medium, through whom a ‘‘spirit’’ has dic- 
tated several novels or stories, and a mass of poetry 
and miscellaneous prose communications, began 
with the ouija board, but later succeeded in hearing 
the voice of her ‘‘control.’? At this particular 
séance, a list of sitters had been prepared in ad- 
vance, from the numerous applications received. 
As a name was called, the owner of the name came 
forward to a seat beside the medium, and shortly 
the ‘‘control’’ would speak to the medium’s hearing 
alone, and the medium would dictate a message 
which might be intended for the particular sitter. 
One name was called, and a lady who came for- 
ward received a message of cheer and encourage- 
ment in the most general terms. At the close she 
stood up and informed the assemblage that the mes- 
sage had a very definite application to her: that she 
herself had mediumistic ‘‘powers,’’ but had been 
somewhat afraid of developing them: that the mes- 
sage meant that she should go ahead without fear 
and develop her ‘‘power.’’ The message might just 
as well have assured her that her husband was not 
eloping with his stenographer, or that the gown her 
dressmaker was working on would turn out satis- 
factorily. 
Another name was called, and a woman in the 
weediest of widow’s garb came forward. After a 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  
PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS IN SPIRITUALISM 107 
slight pause the medium dictated a message which 
began: ‘‘So this is communion! The chalice is put 
to my lips and I would drink, but it is empty! Oh 
God! How I thirst!’? (There may have been a 
word or two more in here, but this is nearly exact.) 
The communication continued in this strain for a 
short time. Then the widow informed the audience 
that as she left the place where she had previously 
been sitting, to come forward, the thought upper- 
most in her mind had been of communion with her 
departed husband. Of course the medium could 
never have guessed this! 
Further illustrations would be but repetitions of 
the same theme. In regard to the general impor- 
tance of the ‘‘will to believe,’ in producing accept- 
ance of the performances of mediums, amateur and 
professional, I might well sum up in the words of 
Florian Slappey: ‘‘It’s the only thing there ain’t 
nothing else but.’’ 
Perhaps the implication from what I have said so 
far might seem to be that all of the mediumistic 
communication is fraudulent, and that all mediums - 
are frauds and cheats. This leads us to the final 
query of the three with which I began: and I shall 
commence the discussion of this by answering it 
with.the statement that in my opinion, many me- 
diums are sincere, at least moderately sincere, and 
that even some of those who deliberately cheat and 
invent in their messages, really believe that a part 
.
-P-A-G-E-106
  108 oLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
of their communications comes from a source out- 
side of themselves. 
Please remember that in this I am considering 
only the mediums who give their messages in a 
natural way; who write, or speak, or otherwise com- 
municate by means which are normal. Slate writ- 
ings, trumpet messages, spirit photographs, mys- 
terious rappings, are all fraudulent, as are all 
alleged physical effects without normal physical 
causes. If a medium claims that something is writ- 
ten on a slate without normal human agency, or 
articles moved about, or bells rung, without human 
or mechanical agency; or that voices or other 
sounds heard by sitters are produced by other than 
living human beings; she is a fraud, and nothing 
she produces is to be taken as other than deliberate 
fraud. 
But there are mediums who make no pretense 
that their messages are not written with their own 
hands or spoken with their own voices, and some of 
these, I say, are sincere, in part at least. Even in 
the case of table-tipping and ouija-boarding, it is 
possible for the person who is really moving the 
board or the table, to be unaware that she is doing 
it. In these latter cases, however, I think it is at 
least rare that the person who really gives the 
message does not know full well that she is direct- 
ing the movements, although the larger part of the 
energy required for the moving of the table or
-P-A-G-E-107
  
  PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS IN SPIRITUALISM 109 
board may be furnished by others unwittingly. As 
I at one time acquired a considerable facility in 
table-tipping, I speak with some authority on this 
subject. 
The question, therefore, is: how is it possible for 
a medium to give messages, with the belief on her 
part that she obtains them from outside of her- 
self, if they are really her own productions? I 
think the answer to this question is not only of con- 
siderable psychological importance in itself, but 
that it also helps to explain the hold which spirit- 
ualism has on the public. A medium who really 
believes in herself will in the long run more clearly 
appear to believe in herself than will a medium who 
is a conscious faker: and spiritualism could not ob- 
tain the hold it has if some mediums at least did not 
seem to believe in themselves. 
A complete answer to this question would involve 
a discussion of thought processes which is entirely 
too long and tedious to be introduced here. For it 
is in the essential nature of the process of thinking, 
as a reaction process of a complex sort, that the 
answer is to be found. All that can be undertaken 
here is a general summary of the reasons why it is 
not difficult for a medium to be deceived. 
Any speaker or writer who speaks or writes 
fluently may easily notice, if he attends to the proc- 
ess of speaking or writing, that the process is not 
necessarily a double one; of thinking first, and then 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  110 oLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
speaking or writing what has been thought; but 
that in many cases (especially in speaking), the 
thinking and the expressing are one and the same 
process. That which one speaks, in fluent speaking, 
is thought as it is spoken: one doesn’t know what 
one is to say, in detail, until it is spoken. In many 
cases, the spoken result is even a pleasant surprise 
to the speaker: in other cases, an unpleasant dis- 
appointment. 
Sometimes, it is true, in writing, one doubles the 
process, thinking over a sentence, or passage, and 
then writing it as a second process. Sometimes one 
does this even in speaking; but then it is usually a 
disadvantage, producing a halting delivery, or 
necessitating thinking what one is to say, when one 
ought to be listening to what someone else is say- 
ing. The efficient, normal method, is to speak and 
think in one process. 
This fact is of great importance in the improve- 
ment of speech habits, and the removal of speech 
defects, such as certain types of stammering, but 
into these matters we need not go now. It is a fact 
because of the nature of the thought process, which 
is always a reaction process in the literal sense, and 
hence is most economically carried on when the 
thought reaction and the expression reaction are 
one and the same. To a certain extent, this econ- 
omy is obtainable in writing; but to a more marked 
degree in speaking, since the flow of speech is faster
-P-A-G-E-109
  
PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS IN SPIRITUALISM 111 
than the flow of writing movements, and the great 
vehicle of precise thought is the spoken word. 
During fluent composition, the fact that ideas are 
not consciously manufactured, but just come, is 
often so striking as to impress even the experienced 
writer. To the psychologist, who has studied the 
mechanism of the thought process, this issuance of 
ideas, occurring sometimes in excellent logical and 
esthetic form, is understandable; and we know it is 
in accordance with the fundamental laws of con- 
scious processes. To the person who knows nothing 
of psychology, however, these occurrences are 
astonishing and miraculous, leading easily to the 
conviction that the ideas come, not from her own 
mind, but from an external source. Hence comes 
the belief in inspiration and in the receipt of ideas 
from other persons. 
The impression of an extra-mental source of 
thoughts is strengthened by the fact that fluency of 
speech is, in general, improved by a policy of 
non-interference with the ideas as they flow. This 
is the first principle of improvement in speech, es- 
pecially in the removal of speech inhibitions. To 
the person who is not psychologically trained, the 
fact that when he lets his expressions come as they 
will, not correcting them, not concerning himself 
with their meaning or coherency, he may obtain a 
fluency and a style which is superior to his awk- 
ward attempts at self-conscious construction, is a 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  112 oLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
striking ‘‘proof’’ that he is getting the ideas from 
some miraculous source. Hence, it is very possible 
for a medium, amateur or professional, to be con- 
vinced of an outside source for her communications, 
and this is possible even in the case of mediums 
who frequently cheat when the ‘‘spirits’’ are not 
working well. 
The detailed psychological explanation of the 
mechanism of thinking does not lead us to the as- 
sumption that thoughts come into the mind from 
the ‘‘unconscious mind.’’ They don’t come ‘‘from’’ 
anywhere, but are constructed in the mind in ac- 
cordance with perfectly well-known laws. The in- 
troduction of an explanation in terms of a mystic 
‘“anconscious mind’’ is merely a device of those 
who do not understand the mechanism of the mind, 
and hence cannot find a real explanation. 
In conclusion, I may point out that in the consid- 
eration of the medium’s own delusion, which un- 
doubtedly contributes largely to the spread of spir- 
itualistic doctrines, we come upon the same funda- 
mental factor which contributes to the acceptance 
by the public of that which they merely want to 
believe, namely, ignorance. The blight of spiritual- 
ism is to be combatted primarily by education in 
simple facts of scientific psychology.

  CHAPTER IV 
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE COMIC 
I hope no one is reading this chapter under the 
supposition that there will be something humorous 
in these pages; for then indeed the situation would 
be comic, and the joke would be on the deceived 
reader. No, this is a very serious matter, this dis- 
section of the comic, and the dissection has about 
the same effect on its comicality that the dissection 
of a watch has on the watch’s time-keeping quali- 
ties, after the wheels and springs and pins and 
screws are spread all over the table. Furthermore, 
I intend to try to convince you that the psychology 
of the comic is indeed a very serious topic, as the 
makers of jokes have always known it to be. 
I may say at the outset that I have really nothing 
‘fundamentally new to offer, and if I had, I should 
hesitate to offer it, since we are constantly im- 
pressed by the fact that what is fundamentally new 
in psychology is usually fundamentally wrong. I 
might add, that of course nobody expects anything 
new in connection with the comic. The analysis 
and conclusions which I am about to present are 
quite commonplace, and if you have not thought 
about them before in exactly the way in which I 
present them to you, you will undoubtedly grant 
ri 113
-P-A-G-E-112
  
114 oLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
their conservatism as soon as you reflect upon them. 
All I can aspire to do is to bring bits and fragments 
together in a systematic way, and perhaps to con- 
vince you that the familiar views on this subject 
are really satisfactory, and that there is no need 
for the newer and bizarre theories which are some- 
times offered. 
In the comic, I mean to include a certain group 
of situations at which we laugh, smile or are 
amused. Not all the situations at which we laugh 
or smile are comic, and later I shall point out the 
non-comic ones, and attempt to indicate their rela- 
tions to the comic. Perhaps if I slash boldly 
through the maze of terminology which has grown 
up about this subject, and say that by the comic I 
mean all those situations which are funny, I shall 
come near to the indication of my topic: but even 
this does not quite cover the logical needs. I shall 
therefore have to let the definition of the comic wait 
upon the analysis thereof. Terms are necessary 
servants, but sometimes they are stupidly ineffi- 
cient, and sometimes they are actual obstacles. 
I shall attempt to show, in the different classes of 
the comic, a certain uniform and essential charac- 
teristic, and thus lead up to the question why situa- 
tions possessing this characteristic produce the 
laugh, or smile, or amused reaction in us human 
animals. I shall therefore examine the typical situ- 
ations at which we are amused, bringing them un-
-P-A-G-E-113
  PSYCHOLOGY OF THE COMIC 115 
der such groupings as are convenient for our pur- 
poses. 
1. The first, and doubtless the most primitive 
kind of the comic, includes bodily suffering and 
pain. These situations appeal especially to savages, 
and among civilized folks, to youths and children, 
although probably none of us are unresponsive to 
them. There are many accounts brought back by 
explorers from Africa, Asia, Australia and the 
islands of the sea, which impress upon us the reality 
of this savage characteristic. ‘The sight of a drown- 
ing man in his last struggles will often throw a 
large group of savages into eestasies of laughter: 
sufferings from wounds and poisons are vastly 
amusing; the hilariously comic effects of torturing 
a captive were frequently experienced by the red 
man whose lands we now occupy. Tales, more or 
less authentic, from the Roman amphitheater might 
be introduced here, if necessary. But we do not 
have to go to ancient or savage societies for illus- 
trations. In the bull ring at Barcelona today, the 
agonies of horses, led blindfold up to the bull to 
have their intestines ripped out, are mirthful spec- 
tacles. Tales from other lands might be told to 
show the essential funniness of the sufferings of 
animals, if the subject were not one from which we 
gladly turn aside. 
Among us of Anglo-Saxon civilization we find the 
savage frequently enough, and even among those 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  116 oLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
classes and stocks where humanitarian ideas and 
motives exclude from adults the pleasure in suffer- 
ing, the younger folks still show it. Not only do 
boys find something comic in the suffering of ani- 
mals, and even of other children: girls also do; and 
tormented frogs and fish, and dogs to whose tails 
tin cans have been affixed, might frequently accuse 
the youthful human female. It would perhaps be 
going too far to say that the girl of three, whom I 
one day found engaged in stepping on caterpillars, 
and laughing gleefully as they were squashed out, 
was extracting mirth from suffering; yet the case 
is true to type. 
2. A second sort of comic, perhaps less brutal, is 
found where the suffering is of a less serious nature. 
Such cases are those of minor physical injuries, and 
injuries which may roughly be termed mental, al- 
though the suffering in these cases is real and may 
be acute. Appreciation of this sort of suffering is 
well-nigh universal. Few are the persons, youth- 
ful or adult, who do not show some signs of mirth 
when a cat has its tail inadvertently stepped on and 
vents its pain ina yowl. Of course, the occurrence 
must be sudden, and apparently undesigned, else 
humanitarian tendencies have time to get in their 
work with some adults—but not with all. The man 
who slips on a banana peel and bruises a sensitive 
part of his person gets a laugh first, and perhaps 
sympathy afterwards. The woman who receives on
-P-A-G-E-115
PSYCHOLOGY OF THE COMIC 117 
her dress a squirt of mud from the wheel of a pass- 
ing truck, the man who happens to be under the 
scaffolding when a painter drops his bucket of 
paint, these evoke unmistakable signs of joy from 
passers-by. If in demonstrating before a class I 
have my fingers pinched in the apparatus, or re- 
ceive an electric shock which makes me jump, the 
class is unanimously amused. Only the very seri- 
ous, the very cultured, are immune to this sort of 
amusement, and even they are sometimes caught 
off guard. 
3. A third class of the comic includes misfor- 
tunes, and defects, physical and mental. These, it 
is true, may be the source of suffering to the unfor- 
tunate person, but they seem to be comic quite apart 
from the potential suffering. The hunchback, the 
lame man, the man with facial deformities, the 
drunken man, the feeble-minded person, the insane 
patient, and the stutterer: these have been vastly 
amusing to generation after generation of our pro- 
genitors, even if they are not to us. And it is but 
a few years since the pitiful tramp was one of our 
stock comic characters, ceasing to be so merely be- 
cause he has practically disappeared from the coun- 
try. 
4. In all these cases, the funniness is increased 
if the suffering, or the misfortune, happens to an 
individual in such a way that he is humiliated, 
angered, saddened, or degraded. The paint falling 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  118 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
on a workingman, in overall and greasy shirt, is 
less comic than that falling on a man dressed as 
adandy. The young athlete chasing his hat in the 
wind is not so funny as the fat bald-headed man in 
the same circumstance. Sometimes where the in- 
dividual is humiliated in the eyes of others, but not 
in his own eyes, the humor is more ‘‘intriguing,’’ 
as the newspapers used to say. Such is the case 
with the dignified man who on April 1st wears, all 
unwittingly, on the tail of his coat the placard read- 
ing, ‘‘Please kick me.’’ So likewise with the stout 
ladies whom we saw, a few years ago, navigating 
the streets in hobble skirts. 
5. A fifth class, of moral defects, might be added. 
Certain types of men and women are keenly amused 
at the beginnings of vice on the part of young peo- 
ple. Perhaps the mirth aroused even among culti- 
vated people, by a child who naively utters pro- 
fanity or blasphemy points to this class also. The 
appreciation of moral degradation is much more 
widespread than most of my readers would read- 
ily admit. A situation which has been many times 
employed upon the stage, and which succeeds in 
arousing great mirth, especially in a highly cul- 
tured audience, is that in which a virtuous young 
man at last falls from the straight and narrow path. 
6. The sorts of the comic so far described are 
accidents, or at least, we have not assumed that 
they were more than accidents. That is to say:
-P-A-G-E-117
PSYCHOLOGY OF THE COMIC 119 
except for the first, the most brutal sort, we have 
not assumed cases which the person amused has 
himself contrived. In many cases, however, there 
is of course intentional, and often deliberate, order- 
ing of the circumstances so that suffering or mis- 
fortune comes to the comic person. You, for ex- 
ample, place the banana peel for the man to slip 
on; you pull the chair out from under someone 
about to seat himself; you nail the half dollar to the 
sidewalk, that some one may be fooled; you send 
the timid man the telegram ‘‘all is discovered, fly 
at once.’’ If the manufacturing of the comic situa- 
tion is unpremeditated, done on the impulse of the 
moment, we call it horseplay; if deliberated, prac- 
tical joking. Undoubtedly, for some individuals, 
this sort of comic situation is funnier than the par- 
allel accidental comic. The reason for this will 
appear later. — 
The foregoing are elemental forms of the comic, 
agreeing in one respect; in each situation someone 
is lowered or degraded: it may be physically or it 
may be mentally, it may be morally, it may be in 
power and standing socially. Many of us would 
like to persuade ourselves that we are above the 
appreciation of this form of the comic, and some of 
us succeed in humbugging ourselves. Some actu- 
ally are so saturated with esthetic and moral ideals 
that these forms of the comic do not excite their 
risibilities. These refined individuals may, how-
-P-A-G-E-118
  120 oLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
ever, respond to another class of the comic, in which 
the suffering, or defect, or misfortune, is not real, 
and not even presented as real, but is presented as 
obvious fiction. 
7. Some of us have developed such sympathies 
and considerations for other persons that we can- 
not enjoy their degradation. If the instinctive ten- 
dency exists, however blocked by humanitarian 
habits, the primitive reaction may be evoked if in 
some way the obstructing forces are themselves 
blocked. This is frequently done through the sud- 
denness with which a comic situation arises, as I 
have earlier pointed out. But the same result may 
‘be obtained through the known unreality of the 
situation. Few individuals, even in a movie audi- 
ence, would enjoy seeing the comedian really struck 
over the head with a sledge hammer, or perhaps I 
should say that if they did enjoy it, they would 
relish it as fit punishment,—not as comic. But 
these same persons do enjoy the situation in which, 
so far as the eye can see, such a blow is delivered. 
They are able to give their impulses rein, and enjoy 
the situation, because they know it is not real. 
Likewise on the stage, the slap-stick comedians 
excite billows of laughter, because the audience 
knows full well that the blows produce neither 
injury nor suffering. If it were not too much of a 
digression, I should like to compare the ease with 
which such effects are produced on the stage and in
-P-A-G-E-119
  
  PSYCHOLOGY OF THE COMIC 121 
pictures, with the difficulty in producing them 
through verbal descriptions. The relation of the 
appreciation of the fictitious comic to the apprecia- 
tion of the real comic is an important point, to 
which I shall return later. 
8. Rising now above the class of degradation, or 
real misfortune, we come to a peculiar sort of the 
comic in which suffering is nevertheless essential. 
The type of this class is embarrassment. No one 
thinks of the embarrassed person as actually defec- 
tive, or saddled with an infirmity: in many cases 
it is imputed to him as a commendable trait, and as 
a practical advantage. Of course, in other cases it 
may be an actual impediment in practical affairs, 
but this is not necessarily, or even characteristically 
the case. Yet the contemplation of the suffering of 
an embarrassed person is keenly enjoyed by the 
spectators. I doubt not that each one of you has at 
some time maneuvered to embarrass some one, in 
order to be amused at the results. In the fictitious 
comic, embarrassment is a factor much used. Many 
yarns that are spun depend for their humor solely 
on the construction of an embarrassing situation. 
Such for example, is the ancient story, occurring in 
many versions, of the man who lost his trousers 
while driving an old-fashioned one-horse buggy. 
After the loss, which is contrived in different ways 
in different versions of the story, he proceeds in 
outward decorum, having tucked the buggy robe  
-P-A-G-E-120
    122 oLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
carefully around his waist and lower extremities. 
Unfortunately, he drives to a spot where, beside the 
road is a woman who has sprained her ankle, and 
who asks him to take her home. In some accounts, 
the woman is his fiancée: more often the latter’s 
mother. The woman cannot get into the buggy 
without assistance. If the driver gets out to assist 
her—the story always stops at this point, having 
succeeded in creating, although in fiction, a situa- 
tion of extreme embarrassment for the young man. 
Here, perhaps you will say that my illustration 
is not carefully chosen; that we are here going over 
to another class of the comic, namely, the salacious, 
and also that my distinction between embarrass- 
ment and degradation breaks down in the illustra- 
tion, since the situation is undoubtedly one from 
which future humiliation will flow if the ribald 
contemporaries of the young man find out about it. 
Perhaps both of these points are well taken, and I 
do not insist on the importance of the class, if it 
can really be distributed elsewhere. 
9. My ninth sort of comic also is one which per- 
haps might be included under one of the earlier 
headings, but it has nevertheless certain features 
which justify its separate consideration. This is 
the sort in which the mention or introduction of 
offensive matters constitutes the comic factor. In 
such cases there may be some one present who is 
offended, or shocked, or whose feelings are in some
-P-A-G-E-121
  PSYCHOLOGY OF THE COMIC 123 
other way so injured that he may be considered as 
having suffered. Sometimes the comic situation is 
attained by rendering some one of delicate suscepti- 
bilities incapable of eating his dinner. In some 
cases, the situation is funny merely because some- 
one’s feelings might be injured, although no one so 
susceptible is actually present. The comic in these 
cases belongs to a type which we have not yet con- 
sidered. To this type also belong many sorts in 
which salacious details are involved, and which we 
will consider later. As a mild illustration of the 
shocking type, I might repeat an obituary poem, 
said to have appeared in a Philadelphia paper: 
A year ago our Willie died; 
We miss him now, but all is well: 
For some day, on the other side, 
We’ll meet our Willie dear in heaven. 
The types of the comic so far described may now 
be summed up. The basis of each situation is a 
person, or sometimes an animal: either a real indi- 
vidual, or an individual presented pictorially or by 
description. This individual—or these individuals, 
since there may be several in the situation—are, or 
are presented as, suffering, or injured, or defective, 
or impotent, or stupid, or subject to emotional 
states which are generally recognized as unpleas- 
ant, humiliating, or in some other way disadvan- 
tageous or undesirable. Such factors may be 
summed up under the general term inferiority.
-P-A-G-E-122
  124 oLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
The comic situation, therefore, is in all these cases, 
the situation in which the inferiority of some indi- 
vidual or individuals is manifested or realized. To 
vast numbers of the human race today, in America, 
Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands, 
Charley Chaplin is the quintessence of the repre- 
sentational comic, because he is presented as physi- 
cally defective, mentally degenerate, morally de- 
praved, and financially impecunious. Moreover, he 
effectively degrades, humiliates, and reduces to im- 
potence, other characters in his screenings. 
There are, however, limits to the inferiority which 
is comic, and for each individual definite conditions 
must be met in order that the situations may not be 
disgusting, or pathetic, or shameful, or brutal, or 
otherwise remote from the comic. Charley Chaplin 
is not comic to many of you, because he is too in- 
ferior. And this raises the question: Inferior to 
what? What is the standard, with reference to 
which the comic is constituted? The standard is 
probably obvious to you already, but a few consid- 
erations will make its nature unmistakable. 
10. A situation is rarely comic to one who is in 
the same situation himself (although there are ex- 
ceptions noted below). If you are broke, impecuni- 
ousness is not apt to be funny to you. If you are 
stupid, an equivalent degree of stupidity does not 
amuse you. If you are humiliated or suffering pain, 
then pain and humiliation of the same sort are dis-
-P-A-G-E-123
PSYCHOLOGY OF THE COMIC 125 
tinetly not laughing matters. There are exceptions 
—but these exceptions are explicable in a simple 
manner. In general, we may conclude, one does not 
laugh at one’s self. Your own inferiority is not a 
comic matter to you. The development of the capac- 
ity to see a joke on one’s self (what Brander 
Matthews calls the real ‘‘sense of humor’’), is a 
rather complicated matter of the ideal comic, and 
in general this development is rather smaller than 
is sometimes supposed. In the great majority of 
cases we laugh at ourselves in rather a mechanical 
fashion, in order that the joke shall not become any 
worse than it is. By being able to see the joke, we 
assert for ourselves a sort of ability. We smile at 
our comic mistakes and mishaps—but inwardly we 
are gritting our teeth, and in the dark our smile is 
pretty small. Our ‘‘ha! ha!’’ when the joke is on us 
lacks the signs of enthusiasm and zest. 
It is true that in some individuals this self-di- 
rected sense of humor reaches a high stage of de- 
velopment, and that these individuals are appar- 
ently able to enjoy jokes on themselves as thor- 
oughly as if they were on someone else; but this 
development is not necessarily an advantage. In 
fact, as Brander Matthews has pointed out, it may 
be a very practical disadvantage in the business of 
life: and however likeable personally may be these 
men who see their own comic aspects, they are 
worsted in the struggle by the men with the Roose-
-P-A-G-E-124
    126 oLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
veltian attitude, who have the habit of taking them- 
selves with the utmost seriousness, and never ad- 
mitting the least bit of inferiority. 
In appreciating a joke on yourself, if you really 
appreciate it, you look at yourself under two as- 
pects. First, as the individual who is made to ap- 
pear inferior, or unfortunate in some respect, and 
second, as an individual who in reality has no such 
defects, and whose great and comforting superior- 
ity is actually enhanced by the transitory appear- 
ance of inferiority which you are convinced is a 
mere accident. 
In all other cases of the comic, the standard of 
reference by which inferiority is judged is unmis- 
takably yourself. From this is revealed another 
reason why too great an inferiority may be fatal 
to mirthfulness. Perhaps you don’t enjoy Charley 
Chaplin because you cannot admit the possibility of 
a comparison between him and yourself. You are 
unable to rejoice over an inferiority where no equal- 
ity was ever considered possible. 
The marks of the struggle for advantage over 
your fellows are evident throughout the comic. 
Mirth is a mode of rejoicing over your outstripping 
of your competitors. There is no rejoicing over 
those who never started in the race. Towards those 
who can never interfere with your success or pre- 
eminence, and who cannot even be imagined as 
your competitors, pity is the practical emotion.
-P-A-G-E-125
PSYCHOLOGY OF THE COMIC 127 
Mirth, in its various forms, may be well described 
as the emotion resulting from your appreciation of 
your own superiority over another or over others. 
It is the ‘‘sudden glory’’ of Hobbes description: 
the triumphant feeling which in accordance with 
Darwin’s suggestion may be traced back to still 
more primitive reactions. 
Looking at the comic from the point of view of 
your own superiority, clears up the cases we earlier 
noted, in which an unfortunate, defective, or de- 
praved person, finds mirth in the misfortune, or 
injuries, or depravity of others. In such cases, the 
effect. produced by the lowering of a previously 
superior person is the same as would be produced 
by the lowering of one’s equal. The transition is in 
the same direction, and the effect of lessening the 
inferiority you have keenly felt might be expected 
to be the same sort of emotion as results from the 
increasing of your own superiority, or the creating 
of a superiority where equality previously existed. 
““The wicked laugh when the righteous are brought 
low,’’ says the Hebrew poet; and it is equally true 
that the impotent may be merry when the powerful 
man collapses. Even the downfall of a monarch of 
the prize ring is a source of glee to the flabby loaf- 
ers. This explains the mirth which the victims of 
any form of vice experience in the initiation of in- 
nocent persons into practices which will eventually 
bring them to the same level of degradation.
-P-A-G-E-126
  128 oLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
We pass on now to the consideration of another 
sort of the comic in which there is no individual 
presented as inferior or degraded, but in which con- 
fusing or puzzling material is presented. This I 
should call the ideal comic in distinction from the 
concrete comic we have been considering. Typical 
of this sort is the bull, which involves gross exag- 
geration, as in the case of the man who declares 
that he ‘‘would never be able to get his new boots 
on until he had worn them a day or two’’; or which 
involves confusing metaphors, as in the statement 
of the sailor that he had ‘‘once visited a country 
where they copper bottomed the tops of the houses 
with sheet lead.’’ Paradoxes, of which the most 
magnificent is the statement that ‘‘all generalities 
are false, this one included,’’ belong in the same 
category. In such cases, some intelligence is re- 
quired to extract the real meaning, and the mirth- 
fulness of the witty formula consists solely in the 
realization of one’s own smartness in being able to 
do the trick, with perhaps the implication that some 
other person might be less smart. The best proof 
of this is found in the fact that when a joke is told 
in company, and some one in the group does not see 
the point, the mirthfulness of the joke is enhanced 
greatly for those who do see it. 
I remember once telling an elderly lady the an- 
cient gag which begins: ‘Why is a man making a 
call like a successful lover?’’ You may remember 
   
-P-A-G-E-127
  
  PSYCHOLOGY OF THE COMIC 129 
this one; it goes on: First he comes to adore, then 
he gives the bell a ring; then the maid takes his 
name, and if he doesn’t find her out he’s taken in.’’ 
Some time later, this elderly lady was overheard 
explaining the riddle as follows: ‘‘First he comes 
to the door, then he rings the doorbell, then the 
maid takes his card, and if he finds her at home he’s 
shown in.’’ Thus was an inane and threadbare gag 
transmuted into a thing of perfect joy, by finding a 
presumably intelligent woman who couldn’t see 
through it. This same lady, in attempting to spring 
another hoary conundrum, made it equally funny. 
‘“‘Why,’’ she asked, ‘‘did they not play cards in 
the Ark?’’ The victim having properly ‘‘given 
up,’’ she announced the answer: ‘‘Because Adam 
sat on the deck.’’ And noting a puzzled look on her 
victim’s face, she added, ‘‘Why don’t you laugh? 
I think it’s very funny.”’ 
I shall make no attempt to classify, or to illus- 
trate in full, this sort of the comic. It runs all the 
way from the pun, which is perhaps the lowest form 
of wit because nobody could possibly fail to see 
through it, up to such constructions as Bill Nye’s 
famous combination of two fragments into: 
O woman, in thine hour of ease, 
Uncertain, coy, and hard to please: 
But seen too oft, familiar with thy face, 
We first endure, then pity, then embrace.
-P-A-G-E-128
  130 oLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
A combination which has mystified not a few illit- 
erates. 
A great deal of wit and humor involves mixtures 
of this ideal comic with the more realistic type we 
have earlier described. |I might illustrate here the 
story of the young lieutenant who was a source of 
irritation to his commanding officer because of his 
tendency to bet~ on anything and everything, 
coupled with an uncanny habit of winning his 
bets. Upon a change in the commanding officer, the 
old C. O. privately warned the new one concerning 
the pernicious tendencies of the lieutenant. The 
new commandant declared that he, having his wis- 
dom teeth and being hard-boiled, would take the 
rascal down a few inches. 
On the first day of the new C. O.’s duty, he took 
occasion, in conversation with the lieutenant, to 
mention his reputation for wild betting. The lieu- 
tenant acknowledged the characteristic. He had, 
he said, an uncontrollable tendency toward freak 
betting. ‘‘Why, right here,’’ he said, ‘‘I’ll bet $25 
you have a crescent-shaped scar between your 
shoulder blades.’’ 
The C. O. saw his chance to score and accepted 
the bet. Retiring to a place where official etiquette 
would not prevent, he removed his jacket and shirt, 
showed no scar, and collected the money. He imme- 
diately wrote to the old C. O., relating his triumph, 
and telling him how easy the lieutenant really was.
-P-A-G-E-129
  
  PSYCHOLOGY OF THE COMIC 131 
He received by return mail this reply: ‘‘You damn 
fool, the young scamp had bet me $50 he’d make 
you take your shirt off the first day.’ 
One characteristic sort of mixed humor is vin- 
dictive, occurring as satire, or ridicule. In many 
instances of this sort, there is a previous animus 
or. enmity against an individual, race, creed, or 
type, and the comicality consists in the lowering of 
this individual, race, or creed, as well as in the wit. 
Jokes on the Irish, the Scotch, the Jews; on Chris- 
tian Science, on William J. Bryan, and so on, be- 
long under this category. 
Let us now return to the question of the profane 
and the salacious in the comic. You have doubtless 
noticed how the introduction of the words damn 
and hell on the stage increase the effect of what 
might otherwise be so faintly mirthful as hardly to 
“get over.’’? To a certain extent this is doubtless 
due to the appreciation that someone might be 
shocked by such language; but he who laughs is 
not shocked,—that is, he is superior. This is not 
the whole story, however. In some cases the pro- 
fanity, or the cursing, is merely a part of the neces- 
sary material out of which a total situation is built, 
and it is the total situation which is comic, the 
wicked material contributing nothing directly, but 
being efficacious through its appropriateness to the 
other material. Two mild illustrations may suffice 
to make this clear.

‘There is the story of a deacon who drove oxen 
and whose language frequently waxed strong, as 
the language of ox drivers will. The incongruity 
between the pious offices of the deacon, and his 
lurid haranguing of his ox team so impressed 
other members of the congregation that they finally 
insisted upon the parson’s remonstrating with the 
deacon. The parson liked not the job, but finally 
did go to call upon the deacon, and worked the con- 
versation around to the point of interest. The dea- 
con quickly caught the drift of things and antici- 
pated the parson’s rebuke by defense of himself, 
winding up with, ‘‘You know, parson, I’m a plain, 
blunt man, and I will call a spade a spade,’’ to 
which the parson replied, ‘‘I’m so glad to hear you 
say that, brother, for I did fear you would call it a 
dammed old shovel.’’ 
In other cases, the strong language is of impor-_ 
tance as indicating the emotional state of some 
character of consequence to the plot or story. The 
following illustration will make this point: A man 
afflicted with stammering went to a school in a 
northern city in which they teach a method of beat- 
ing time with the hand or finger, the stammerer 
“heating out’’ his words in that way. After taking 
the course, this man returned to his native city and 
complained as follows concerning the failure of his 
treatment: “‘Of-course-I-can-talk-this-way,-but- 
dammit-I-don’t-want-to-talk-this-way.”’
-P-A-G-E-131
  PSYCHOLOGY OF THE COMIC 133 
A great deal of the comic material of the stage, 
the movies, comic drawings, and printed and oral 
stories, involves salacious elements. In some of 
these cases, the salacity is of importance solely be- 
cause it is an integral part of the material out of 
which the general plot or situation is built. Just as 
a funny story may be built around a horse trade, 
although there is nothing intrinsically comic about 
trading horses, so a comic situation may be based 
on sex activities, without assuming anything intrin- 
sically funny in such activities. The stories of 
Boccaccio are striking examples of this, and one of 
them, which was re-enacted not long ago in an 
American city, detail for detail, will serve as an 
excellent illustration. A gentleman, who suspected 
his wife of undue tenderness towards another man, 
decided to lay a trap to test his suspicions. He 
therefore announced in advance that he was going 
to New York on a certain evening, and on that eve- 
ning carried out his announced plan so far as to 
leave his house with his luggage, and go to the 
railroad station. But from the station he doubled 
back to his domicile, and peeking in the dining 
room window he saw his wife and the third angle 
of his domestic triangle, eating supper together. 
Desiring to confront them inside the house, the 
schemer proceeded to crawl in through the pantry 
window, but in so doing slipped and fell, knocking 
over some articles with a great clatter. This drew  
-P-A-G-E-132

  the wife and friend upon him, and pretending not 
to recognize him, in spite of his protestations, they 
together beat him up so that he had to be taken to 
the hospital for repairs. 
Some obscene wit and humor may doubtless be 
accounted for by the offensiveness of the material 
employed, either to actual listeners, or to potential 
ones, in accordance with principles we have earlier 
discussed. There still remains over, however, a 
mass of the comic which depends on the mere pleas- 
ingness which the salacious in itself has for many 
persons. While this salacity is not really comic, it 
produces an emotional reaction which is closely 
akin to amusement, and adds to the total emotion, 
even acting in some cases as a complete substitute 
for amusement. There is nothing of which the 
human male has been more vain throughout the 
extent of history than of his sexual capacity, and 
salacious references, which remind him of his sex- 
ual powers, produce a pleasing feeling of superior- 
ity, particularly if his sexual life is morbid. 
We must not overlook in this connection one fact 
of wide importance, which is that a comic situation 
must be built up of material which is both intelli- 
gible and interesting to the spectator. The composite 
verse I quoted from Bill Nye has no comic aspect to 
the person who does not recognize the two compo- 
nent fragments. One would not expect the average 
theater audience to be vastly amused by a Bernard
-P-A-G-E-133
  
  PSYCHOLOGY OF THE COMIC 135 
Shaw comedy. Many of the lewd jokes in Shakes- 
peare’s plays pass entirely over modern heads. 
Now, matters of sex are not only interesting to per- 
sons of all degrees of education, but they are also 
very intelligible. Perhaps one reason why the 
theme of almost every stage comedy which rises 
above the ‘‘low-brow”’ or ‘‘custard pie’’ type, is 
adultery, is to be found in the fact that the situa- 
tions thus developed are intelligible, and the emo- 
tional developments understood by a wide range of 
persons who could not understand situations built 
on themes of more limited appeal. 
I have now covered only one part of my topic, in 
answer to the question as to what we laugh at; the 
second question, as to why we laugh at it, I shall 
have to treat more briefly. The comic is always 
that which enhances one’s appreciation of his own 
superiority, but not all suggestions of superiority 
are comic. The marathon winner, falling across the 
finish line, keenly appreciates his own superiority, 
but is not amused. The winner of any contest, and 
the one who, if not engaging in a trial of capacity, 
yet feels his muscles, or ‘‘feels his oats,’’ is pleased 
at his superiority over others, and over environ- 
mental attacks: but the pleasure is not funny. Yet 
in all such cases, the characteristic expression of 
pleasure is very similar to that which comes from 
the comic: laughter, smiles, and less definitely  
-P-A-G-E-134
  136 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
nameable accompaniments. All triumph is alike, 
and the instinctive expressions of its realization are 
much the same. Following the suggestions of Dar- 
win and Spencer, we may look upon the expressions 
of amusement as a survival of the reactions which 
naturally follow a life and death struggle in which 
one has triumphed over his adversary—laughter is 
strikingly like the triumphant panting of the nearly 
exhausted victor—or as a survival of reactions pre- 
paratory to battle—the smile suggests the ferocious 
grimace, and may be degenerated from it. These 
are interesting speculations, but do not greatly hold 
our interest. However the reaction tendency may 
have developed in the first place, it is transmitted 
in the human species in fairly definite form: One 
type of reaction, for those aspects of triumph which 
are of practical importance in the struggle for ex- 
istence, and a slightly differing type for those ap- 
preciations of superiority which are of less vital 
importance, and which we call appreciation of the 
comic. These two shade into each other by insen- 
sible gradations, and are mixed together in many 
situations which we class as comic. In the vindic- 
tive type, the salacious type, as well as in the lower 
and more brutal types, practical self-congratula- 
tion, the feeling of superiority in matters which 
are intensely important to the individual, may pre- 
dominate over the truly comic appreciation. 
The vital point now remaining concerns the exact 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
PSYCHOLOGY OF THE COMIC 137 
element in the comic reaction which differentiates 
it from the reaction of triumph in general. Let me 
confess at once that on this point we have nothing 
but speculation, and speculations are not important 
except to the man who uses them as a basis for 
experimental attack. This is then the matter which 
must be left for experimentation, and that it has 
been left so long is something we may regret, but 
of which we need not be ashamed, since we do not 
conceive that it has such importance for practical 
life as to warrant our neglecting other problems for 
it. 
The points we have discussed above, however, do 
have very important practical bearing. The ques- 
tion as to the effects which Mr. and Mrs. Jiggs and 
the other comic strips have on the children who so 
thoroughly enjoy them; the problem of the various 
types of the comic which are offered us on the 
screen and stage; all these receive illumination as 
soon as we look at them from the point of view I 
have been presenting. There can be no doubt that 
to those who enjoy them, the comic strips and the 
custard pie comedies are actually elevating and re- 
fining, destroying the tendency to enjoy actual suf- 
fering and degradation just in so far as they form 
the habit of appreciating the fictitious; and that 
they prepare the way for appreciation of still 
higher forms of the comic. 
In so far as we establish a tendency towards the
-P-A-G-E-136
138 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
vicarious satisfaction of our baser instincts, 
through responses which are at least one stage 
higher than the primitive, in so far we prepare the 
way for a second modification, and make easier the 
acceptance of a still higher substitution, always 
assuming that the next higher substitution is of- 
fered. I have no doubt that the enjoyments typified 
by the comic strips are decreasing the actual bru- 
tality of our children, and I look forward confi- 
dently to a lessening of savagery throughout the 
world, due to the missionary efforts of Charley 
Chaplin and his imitators.

CHAPTER V 
THE READING OF CHARACTER FROM 
EXTERNAL SIGNS 
The relations between general psychology and 
individual psychology are important and not hard 
to grasp. Neither can be separated from the other 
in practice, but each has its set of problems and its 
complement of special methods. The problems of 
general psychology concern the determination of 
laws and principles applying to the human animal 
generally, which are either independent of individ- 
ual peculiarities, or inclusive of these idiosyncrasies 
as definite combinations of general factors, not as 
exceptions. The problems of individual psychol- 
ogy, on the other hand, concern the discovery of 
those factors of difference between individuals; 
thus, ultimately, the description of the important 
respects in which each individual varies from other 
individuals, and in as far as classification is useful, 
the assigning of each individual to the class or 
classes in which he belongs. The specific methods 
of general psychology are included under the gen- 
eral term experiment; the methods of individual 
psychology under the term mental measurement. 
The most obvious relation between the two 
branches is through the fact that reliable mental 
139 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  140 oLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
measures (commonly called mental tests) can be 
developed only through experimentation of the 
most rigorous kind, and the fact that general prin- 
ciples can be obtained only by taking into account 
the individual differences of the various reactors 
on whom experimental work is done. One of the 
most unfortunate and harmful details of the pres- 
ent enthusiastic movement in the individual psy- 
chology, in education, in industry, and in medicine, 
is the naive assumption that persons ignorant of 
general psychology and untrained in experimental 
psychology can develop and apply mental tests in 
a useful way without the careful supervision of 
competent psychologists. The deleterious results 
of such bungling work on children, for example, are 
apparent not only in the harm to the children and 
needless trouble and expense to which parents are 
put, but also in the prejudices aroused in the pub- 
lie mind against mental measurements as a result of 
the mistakes of amateurs. Equally unfortunate 
results are frequent in the legal, medical and indus- 
trial applications of amateur psychology. The gen- 
eral recognition of the need of individual psychol- 
ogy in commerce and industry in particular has led 
to the existence of a class of mere exploiters, many 
of whom reap large financial rewards from their 
practices, and whose eventual effect on the manu- 
facturers and business men, they victimize is to turn 
them against the application of real psychology.
-P-A-G-E-139
  READING OF CHARACTER 141 
Mental measurements have so far been developed 
to the point where effective determinations of gen- 
eral intelligence are made—determinations which 
are of value not only for schools and colleges, but 
also for commerce and industry. No psychologist 
claims that these measurements are completely sat- 
isfactory, and we all know that they are being con- 
stantly improved, and will be enormously improved 
in the future. On the other hand, no one but the 
psychologist knows the amount of time, labor, and 
personal training required for the development and 
standardization of even the simplest test. The pub- 
lic, impressed by the apparent simplicity of the 
materials, assumes that any one can make up a test, 
and the public is right so far: any one can make 
up a test, and almost every one does, but the tests 
are not worth anything. The public either does not 
see this, or, if it does see it, assumes that the tests 
made up by the expert are also worthless. For 
some of the confusion the psychologists themselves 
are partly responsible. For example, the nomen- 
clature of ‘‘mental ages’’ as established by intelli- 
gence tests, which should never have been allowed 
to escape from the laboratories, has very much; con- 
fused and prejudiced the public. 
In addition to tests of ‘‘general intelligence’’ 
(which may most safely be defined as that which 
standard intelligence tests measure), tests for spe- 
cial intellectual capacities have been developed.
-P-A-G-E-140
142 oLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
We can now measure ability to sustain and to dis- 
tribute the attention, ability to perceive accurately 
details of various kinds, ability to learn, ability to 
avoid learning, and many other special abilities of 
this class. The field of such measurments is rapidly 
being extended, and it now requires merely the ap- 
plication of the labor of the trained psychologist to 
develop systematic tests for the special combina- 
tions of intellectual abilities required in any branch 
of any trade or profession. 
But this is the limit to which mental measure- 
ments so far have extended. Emotional and moral 
characteristics are not as yet measurable. Yet we 
know that these characteristics are of immense im- 
portance in all the divisions of life in which we are 
measuring intellectual capacity. Even as concerns 
the candidate for admission to college, while it is 
important to determine his intellectual capacity, 
emotional and moral factors ought to be known. 
There is many a man who goes down or barely sur- 
vives in college, whose intellectual ability is suf- 
ficiently good, but who will not work, or who will 
get into trouble because of moral delinquency, or 
whose scale of values is inadequate. 
I do not say that we shall never be able to meas- 
ure these characteristics by the methods of individ- 
ual psychology; in fact, I think that ultimately we 
shall compass such measurement. A number of us 
are now at work on the problem of moral measure- 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
READING OF CHARACTER 148 
ments, and I think the prospects for development 
along this line are favorable. But at present we 
do not pretend to make standardized measurements 
of emotional and moral capacity. 
Wherever there is a great need, attempts to fill 
it will be made; these attempts will not all be scien- 
tific, and not all made in good faith, especially if 
there is a prospect of fat remuneration. The his- 
torical development of medicine is an illustration of 
this fact. Medical practice developed long before 
there was any known basis for it, and the bane of 
the medical profession today is the tendency to 
apply something in cases where there is really noth- 
ing to apply—a tendency against which Osler and 
other medical leaders have protested emphatically, 
and with some success. 
The past lack of scientific means of measuring 
intelligence, and the lack of scientific means of 
measuring moral and emotional characteristics, to- 
gether with the real need for such measures, has 
led to the development of unscientific methods of 
mental diagnosis which are popularly designated as 
character analysis. These methods are based on 
the assumption that there is a close relation be- 
tween the anatomy of the individual and his mental 
characteristics, and that the details of this relation- 
ship may be discovered by casual examination, 
without the aid of statistical methods or experi- 
mental procedure, by persons ignorant not only of 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  144 oLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
psychology but even of the rudiments of physiol- 
ogy. 
The first systematic attempt at the development 
of character analysis was made by the phrenolo- 
gists. The physiologist Gall early in the nineteenth 
century began to teach that the mental life is 
largely dependent upon the brain, especially upon 
the cerebral hemispheres. This fact was not widely 
recognized before the time of Gall, although it has 
become a commonplace since then, and Gall’s work 
had a large influence in bringing this recognition 
about. But Gall and his disciples are also respon- 
sible for the introduction into psychology of sev- 
eral misleading conceptions concerning the relation 
of the brain to consciousness—conceptions which 
have retarded the development of psychology and 
which are being eliminated but slowly. Gall and his 
pupil Spurzheim developed a theory of the relation 
of the brain to mind which they called phrenology, 
which means literally the study of the intellect. 
These phrenologists believed that the different 
faculties or capacities of the mind were localized, 
each in specific portions of the cortex or outer 
surface of the cerebral hemispheres. They further 
believed that the relative development of each of 
these faculties depended upon the relative size of 
the portions of the brain in which the respective 
faculties were supposed to reside. Highly devel- 
oped philoprogenitiveness, or love of children, for
-P-A-G-E-143
  READING OF CHARACTER 145 
example, was supposed to depend upon a cortex 
relatively thicker in the philoprogenitive area than 
_is the cortex in the same area of a person less 
strongly philoprogenitive. Finally, since they sup- 
posed the conformation of the skull to agree with 
the relative thickness of the cortex it encloses, they 
assumed the possibility of diagnosing the develop- 
ment of various cortical areas by examination of 
the outer surface of the cranium. The surface of 
the head was accordingly mapped off into a number 
of small areas, each associated with one of the fac- 
ulties in the phrenological list; and from the rela- 
tive depression or elevation of these areas the 
phrenologist attempted to read the ‘‘character’’ of 
the subject. 
We need not dwell upon the series of bold as- 
sumptions involved in this system, since, from the 
scientific point of view, the system is of historical 
interest only. Quite aside from the further devel- 
opment of phrenology as a technique, it had a pro- 
found and on the whole unfortunate influence upon 
the course of psychobiology for many years. Phys- 
iologists and psychologists fell into the habit of 
assuming that consciousness is dependent upon 
brain activity in a remarkably simple way, ignor- 
ing the complicated interrelations of the various 
parts of the nervous system, and ignoring the fun- 
damental function of the total nervous system in 
the control of movements through sensory stimula-
-P-A-G-E-144
  146 oLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
tion. Moreover, both the psychologists and the 
physiologists accepted even the phrenological doc- 
trine of the localization of conscious functions in 
specific parts of the cortex, although the functions 
as thus localized by the physiologists were not the 
“‘faculties’’ of the phrenologists, but a more gen- 
eralized group, including the senses. It is only 
within the last fifteen years that’ psychologists have 
begun to reject the phrenological theory, and many 
physiologists still cling to it. 
As an art, phrenology had a wide popular vogue 
and is still practiced lucratively in the United 
States, there being at least one school in which the 
system is taught. It has, however, sunk to a posi- 
tion of relatively minor importance, and has been 
largely supplanted by newer systems, in part de- 
rived from it, and in part derived from still older 
anatomical beliefs. In these newer systems little 
emphasis is placed upon the surface of the skull, 
the major stress being laid upon the contours of the 
face, upon the size and form of the nose, mouth, 
ears, brows and eyes, upon the color and texture of 
the hair, and upon similar anatomical traits. 
In one of the most widely known systems, from 
which many other systems have been drawn, ‘‘con- 
scientiousness’’ is indicated by a broad, bony chin; 
‘“benevolence’”’ by a full, rolling, moist under lip; 
“love of home”’ by fullness of the soft part of chin 
just below the lip; ‘‘amativeness’’ by the thickness,
-P-A-G-E-145
READING OF CHARACTER 147 
moisture and redness of the central part of the up- 
per lip; ‘‘cautiousness’’ by an extremely long nose; 
“‘judgment’’ by a broad large nose; ‘‘observation”’ 
by a lowering of the brows at their inner ends and 
projection of the frontal bone at that point. Mu- 
sical talent is indicated in this system by an ear of 
rounding form and fine quality, with a deep bell 
and perfectly formed rim. Mathematical ability is 
shown by squareness of the face bones, width be- 
tween the eyes, and especially by the upward curve 
of the outer part of the eyebrow. The signs of ac- 
quisitiveness are a thick, heavy upper eyelid, with 
fullness and breadth of the nose just above the nos- 
tril. Sometimes an arched, curved or hooked nose 
indicates the same thing. But in this system the 
significance of many signs is modified by others; 
hence, the degree of development of a given char- 
acteristic is read, not from a single anatomical sign 
but from a group of anatomical details, to which I 
will apply the term phystognomic pattern. Thus, 
a certain relative form or size of one feature might 
indicate a certain mental trait, provided it is ac- 
companied by certain other details of form, position 
and size of other features. Linguistic ability, for 
example, is shown by large bright convex eyes, full- 
ness under the eyes, the rounding out of head above 
temples, full lips, full cheeks, full throat, wide 
mouth and chest, large nostrils, length from point 
of nose to tip of chin, with vertical, lateral and per-
-P-A-G-E-146
    148 oLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
pendicular width of concha of ear. The physiog- 
nomic pattern indicative of well-developed color 
sense is decided color of the complexion, eyes, eye- 
brows and hair, clearness of skin, and veins show- 
ing through. 
By the use of pattern instead of single signs there 
is secured an elasticity of application of the system, 
which is of great importance, and to which I shall 
later refer. : 
The foregoing samples are drawn from a single 
system; but this system is one from which a num- 
ber of variant systems have apparently been de- 
rived. There are many systems in use, all equally 
definite, all equally ‘‘successful.’’ Some systems 
stick pretty closely to physiognomy; some add signs 
from the voice, posture, and the anatomical details 
of arms, leg and trunk. But all these systems agree 
in two points: They are in the main anatomical, 
and they are lucrative to their promoters. 
The attempts to read character from anatomical 
signs have not, however, originated in modern 
times, nor have they been confined to professional 
character analysts. Evidences of popular associa- 
tions between anatomical details and especially be- 
tween facial and mental and moral traits are to be 
found in the literature of all peoples. ‘‘Let me 
have men about me that are fat,’? Shakespeare 
makes Caesar say. Confluent eyebrows have long 
been supposed to be evidence of a lecherous dispo- 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
READING OF CHARACTER 149 
sition; a long nose of meddlesomeness; red hair of 
passion; and so on ad infinitum. As an attempt 
made in all seriousness to evolve a scientific system 
of mento-anatomy, I may point to Lombroso’s de- 
scription of the criminal type. It is evident that we 
have here to deal with tendencies which are wide- 
spread, and which are by no means always operat- 
ing in the interests of private profit. Yet it is the 
professional character analyst who forms the main 
problem, since it is his work which furnishes the 
most pernicious results. 
It requires little investigation to convince us that 
the systems of character analysis now in use have 
no scientific foundation, and that if any one of them 
were in part valid, it would be a most marvelous 
coincidence. None of the authors of the various 
modern systems shows any evidence of knowledge 
of physiology or psychology, to say nothing of 
genetics; nor do they attempt to apply even the 
simplest principles of statistics or experimental pro- 
cedure in arriving at their conclusions. Naive con- 
clusions from selected cases at the best, mere 
guesses at the worst, are the sole means employed. 
A study of works on physiognomy strongly reminds 
the reader of the interpretations of the psychical 
researchers and the Freudians. Aside from this, 
the contradiction of system by system would give 
even the layman cause to doubt. If we consider the 
signs of the same character trait, such as ‘‘hon-
-P-A-G-E-148
  150 oLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
esty,’’ we find it indicated in different systems by 
quite different signs. If we consider the same sign, 
such as the shape of the nose, we find it indicating 
quite different traits in different systems. And 
yet the claims of any one system to practical suc- 
cess are as well substantiated as are those of any 
other system. 
Nevertheless, the incompetence of the existing 
systems does not dispose of the question whether 
there might not be a valid system evolved. In spite 
of the futile efforts of various would-be flyers, the 
airplane was invented. We must inquire therefore 
what possible basis there is for a system of char- 
acter analysis based on anatomical signs. And we 
find the answer that there is no known basis on 
which such a system might be constructed. 
We know that the exercise of mental and moral 
capacities does not change the gross anatomical de- 
tails of the human being. (Some of the systems of 
character analysis assume the contrary.) That a 
man cannot, by taking thought, add to his height is 
true, and is an illustration of a more general law. 
No. exercise of generosity, judgment, musical talent, 
malice or amativeness can change the form of the 
nose, or of the ear, or the setting of the eyes, or the 
form of the brows. If training cannot develop ana- 
tomical signs, then the putative signs of character 
must be signs of inherited capacity only, showing 
the endowment of the individual in respect to ca-
-P-A-G-E-149
  READING OF CHARACTER 151 
pacities which he may or may not have cultivated 
and developed. 
But the results of genetics to date give us no 
basis for assuming anatomical signs of inherited 
capacity, except in pure races or relatively homo- 
geneous races. It is true that we may conclude 
from such signs as the shape of the eyes and the 
color and texture of the hair that a certain individ- 
ual belongs to the Chinese race, and hence that he 
has traits of character common to the Chinese. But 
the Chinese race, although not an absolutely pure 
race, is one which is sharply distinct from the white 
races, and we may expect to find different racial 
characteristics, although as a matter of fact the 
characteristics usually imputed to the Chinese are 
probably due more to training than to heredity. A 
Chinese boy, brought up under white conditions, is 
surprisingly like a white boy mentally, although he 
retains his anatomical race characteristics. In the 
case of the negro and of other markedly inferior 
races definite racial mental differences may be ad- 
mitted. But we must remember that these differ- 
ences are racial, not individual. 
The European races, however, are exceedingly 
mixed, being the products of the blendings of many 
stocks, and although it is possible that the original 
pure stocks may have had specific anatomical char- 
acteristics and also specific mental characteristics, 
we find no linkage of these characteristics in their
-P-A-G-E-150
  152 oLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
hereditary transmission after mixture. A remote 
ancestor of a certain man may have belonged to a 
stock which had long noses and also had violent 
dispositions; another remote ancestor may have be- 
longed to another stock, having snub noses and 
great amiability. The man under consideration 
may, however, have inherited the long nose from 
the one stock and the amiable disposition from the 
other. This fact comes out most clearly in the 
blendings of the white and negro races. The feat- 
ures of the mulatto or the octoroon give no indica- 
tion of the relative mental inheritance of the indi- 
vidual from his white and colored progenitors, al- 
though statistically the greater the proportion of 
white ancestry, the greater may be the probability 
of white intelligence. 
It is possible, although not probable, that our 
feeble-minded whites inherit their mental defect 
from certain original pure stocks of low mentality 
which unfortunately became mixed with the other 
European stocks, but there are no anatomical signs 
by which the feeble-minded may be identified. Nor 
are there any anatomical signs of the criminal, 
Lombroso to the contrary notwithstanding. 
It is true that there are certain exceptions to the 
generalizations I have made. Cretins, microceph- 
alic and macrocephalic individuals and other dis- 
tinctly pathological cases show anatomical signs of 
their mental deficiencies. So does a blind man
-P-A-G-E-151
READING OF CHARACTER 153 
show that he is deficient in the visual faculty and 
the legless man show his deficiency in the faculty of 
locomotion. But these cases are due to specific de- 
fects, and have no bearing on the attempts to 
analyze and classify the common run of humanity. 
These pathological cases may be easily segregated, 
and character analysis contributes nothing to our 
identification of them. In the remaining bulk of the 
population there is no discernible principle of link- 
age of the mental and the anatomical. 
Finding no scientific basis for the anatomical 
character analysis, we are now thrown back upon 
the pragmatic problem. How is it that these 
systems apparently succeed? And we must admit 
that they do have at least financial success, for 
many of the character analysts are making money 
from their practice on commercial and industrial 
concerns. 
For this success there are two outstanding rea- 
sons: first, the actual value of character readings 
is rarely checked up; second, a few, not many, of 
the professional analysts, when subjected to actual 
tests, can make surprisingly good guesses. 
As an illustration of the way in which character 
reading may obtain the prestige of success with- 
out being checked up in regard to its accuracy, I 
may cite the case of a large industrial plant, in 
which several thousand employees were ‘‘an- 
alyzed’’ by a reputed ‘‘expert’”’ at a good round 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  154 oLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
price. This expert had a system devised by him- 
self after the usual type, and apparently drawn 
either directly or indirectly from the older system 
from which my illustrations were taken and from 
which many other popular systems are drawn. 
This self-styled expert told me that in his opinion 
the systems of several other and better known 
fakers, whom he named, were defective because 
they were too rigid. ‘‘Now I,’’ he went on to say, 
“‘have used in my system all that is worth while 
in psychology, phrenology and physiology; but I 
am not hide-bound like the others. When I find 
a case to which the system doesn’t apply, I discard 
the system and use common sense.’’? This expert 
spent several minutes in interviewing each em- 
ployee, marking on a form card the characteristics 
of eyes, mouth, ears, hair, head form, ete. Then, 
combining these records, he decided upon the gen- 
eral mental and moral characteristics of the in- 
dividual, and upon the particular line of work, if 
any, in the plant at which he should be put. 
The ‘‘experting’’ of these employees was done 
at the instance of one of the directors of the cor- 
poration who had become interested in this sort of 
“‘efficiency’’ through the ‘‘success’’ obtained by 
it in certain other corporations. By the time the 
analyses were completed, this director had lost in- 
terest in this particular fad, and had become in- 
terested in another kind of ‘‘efficiency.’’ The re-
-P-A-G-E-153
  READING OF CHARACTER 155 
sults were, of course, pigeonholed; the managers 
and foremen who were actually working with the 
employees knew too much to use the readings. But 
the ‘‘expert’’ went on to the next job with thou- 
sands of dollars in his pocket, and with the reputa- 
tion of having successfully ‘‘experted’’ this cor- 
poration, whose directors, being cold, hard business 
men, obviously would not have put money in the 
scheme unless it were financially profitable. This 
corporation, of course, had been influenced by 
similar considerations. Other concerns had their 
employees ‘‘experted’’ ‘‘successfully,’’ the success - 
having been of the same imaginary sort. 
“‘Suecess’’? under the conditions of an actual 
check-up is another matter, and it is said that 
certain ‘‘experts’’ have, under test conditions, 
achieved a surprising measure of success. Such 
tests are made by submitting to the inspection of the 
‘expert’? a number of individuals of known and 
proved capacity in various lines, but who are un- 
known to the ‘‘expert.’? The ‘‘expert’’ is then re- 
quired to make a written statement as to the mental 
characteristics of each person, and these statements 
are compared with previously prepared statements 
based on the established characteristics of the test- 
persons. 
Now I cannot guarantee that any such tests have 
actually been successful. I have to restrict my 
statement to the form ‘‘it is said.’’ There are, of
-P-A-G-E-154
  156 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
course, many chances of erroneous conclusions 
when the tests are not made under the rigid super- 
vision of psychologists. We know from the alleged 
proofs of telepathy and of various forms of spirit 
manifestations that unskilled investigators com- 
monly overlook the most vital points in the test 
conditions, because they do not know their im- 
portance. The records on most tests of this sort 
have a value of approximately zero, because they 
contain no reliable evidence on the vital points, 
however much detailed information is given on 
other points. 
But suppose we assume (although we may have 
as yet no good grounds for the assumption) that 
tests of certain character-analysts have given posi- 
tive results. This would not be surprising. In 
fact, I should expect to find that some ‘‘experts’’ 
could produce positive results. Few ‘‘experts’’ are 
willing to submit to real tests, but those few who 
are willing must be so because they are confident 
that they could succeed to some extent, even in a 
carefully checked test. 
We may freely admit that certain persons, work- 
ing in entire independence of any system, may be 
able to make some good guesses. Many of us think 
that we can make good guesses. Our guesses are 
probably very much less accurate than we suppose, 
yet they may have some validity. In many cases 
we have to entrust important matters to individuals
-P-A-G-E-155
    
READING OF CHARACTER 157 
as to whose honesty or intelligence we have no evi- 
dence except from our guesses based on brief ob- 
servation of the visible appearance of the indi- 
vidual. There is no reason to suppose that pro- 
fessional character analysts should not be able to 
make as good guesses as any one else, provided 
these experts have the requisite native capacity, 
and provided that, like the one I quoted, they 
ignore their systems and use common sense. 
It is actually a fact that we do make correct judg- 
ments about the transient mental processes of other 
persons without being able to identify the facts on 
which these judgments are based. If you are talk- 
ing to some one, and you say something which of- 
fends or grieves or pleases him, you may recognize 
that fact at once, although it may be impossible for 
you to designate the exact change in his face or 
voice or posture which is the basis of your idea. 
You may even make similar judgments when carry- 
ing on a conversation over the telephone, in which 
case changes in the timbre and inflections of the 
voice alone could give you the clue. You know 
from the other person’s voice that he is offended 
or pleased, although you may not be able to identify 
the exact change in his voice which is the im- 
portant factor. When you have the visual clues 
from the other person’s face, as well as the clues 
from his voice, your judgments are more definite 
and more secure. 
   
-P-A-G-E-156
  158 oLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
This whole matter is but a special case of the 
more general phenomenon of perception and judg- 
ment by sign. It is a fact that in much of our per- 
ception we perceive meanings without perceiving 
the signs on which the perception is based. In 
some cases, the signs could be perceived, if atten- 
tion were drawn to them; in other cases, the signs 
cannot be discriminated even under the best con- 
ditions. I shall not go into this topic in an extended 
way, both because it is familiar to psychologists, 
and because it cannot be briefly expounded to those 
without psychological training. I mention it only 
to show that on this point of character readings 
we are not dealing with a unique phenomenon, but 
with a particular manifestation of a general prin- 
ciple which runs broadly through our mental life. 
As another illustration of the general principle, 
I may refer to certain cases of supposed ‘‘thought- 
reading’’ which are really cases of sign-reading. 
Many amateurs succeed in catching ideas from 
other persons, where there is physical relation of 
such sort that movements of the second person may 
actually stimulate receptors of the first person, 
either tactually, visually or acoustically. But these 
amateurs never succeed if they watch for the signs. 
They succeed only when they ignore the signs and 
attend to the meanings. In fact, if amateurs who 
succeed brilliantly in muscle reading tests become 
convinced that their performance really is muscle
-P-A-G-E-157
READING OF CHARACTER 159 
reading and nothing more occult, they can usually 
do the trick no longer, and this is precisely what 
we might expect. Similarly, if, instead of watch- 
ing to see whether the person you are talking to 
is pleased or not, you watch for the facial changes 
which indicate pleasure, you will not catch his emo- 
tional changes unless the symptoms are extremely 
gross. The conditions here are not greatly different 
from those obtaining in the visual perception of 
depth, where, if you attend to the signs, conver- 
gence, accommodation, binocular disparity, and so 
on, you will lose the depth-effect which those signs 
would give if they were not attended to. 
The important question, therefore, is: What are 
the signs which tell us something about the mental 
characteristics of other persons? In the case of 
fleeting, ideational and emotional changes, these 
signs are obviously not anatomical; and in the case 
of fundamental tendencies of mental and moral 
sorts, we have already shown that there are no 
known anatomical signs. We are, therefore, forced 
to the conclusion that in the one case as in the other, 
the signs are physiological. Changes in the com- 
plicated muscular system of the face do occur along 
with ideas, especially if these ideas are emotionally 
toned. Changes in the complex musculature of the 
vocal organs and changes in the arm, leg and trunk 
muscles also occur. There are, in other words, 
changes in voice, in features, in posture and in 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  160 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
other bodily postures and movements which are 
perfectly competent to serve as indexes of idea- 
tional and emotional changes. Unfortunately, we 
have not yet succeeded in analyzing more than the 
most gross of these signs. 
Fundamental tendencies in ideational and emo- 
tional reaction give rise to habitual modes of ex- 
pression of the various sorts. Habitual modes of 
expression, moreover, leave their traces, especially 
in the face, even when the actual expression is not 
occurring. There would seem to be, therefore, a 
complex system of signs, not only of fleeting mental 
changes, but signs also of character traits, pro- 
vided we can make use of them. 
Signs of this sort are effective, prior to analysis. 
Habits of perception and of judgment are built up 
on signs, without necessitating any analysis or 
identification of such signs. Moreover, the develop- 
ment of the capacity to catch meanings in this way, 
if it be possible, depends upon native capacity as 
well as upon practice. We should, therefore, expect 
to find exactly what we do find, namely, that there 
is great individual variation in this apparent skill, 
and that in the absence of a really comprehensive 
and accurate analysis of signs, the attempt to at- 
tend to signs is a disturbing factor. 
Character analysts, if successful under the real 
test conditions, obviously make their guesses just 
as you or I do. ‘‘The systems’’ can be nothing 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
READING OF CHARACTER 161 
but obstacles, since they have no real bearing on 
the problem. But, after having made a guess, the 
analyst can readily find in his system details which 
back up his guess, provided the system is elastic, 
depending upon sign patterns rather than upon 
hard and fast single signs. We need not assume 
that successful character analysts,.if there are such, 
go through this sophistical process deliberately. 
The tendency to construe evidence to suit one’s 
theory, and to recognize the data which may thus 
be construed, overlooking conflicting data, is too 
well known and too widespread to need demonstra- 
tion. One of the important reasons why scientific 
procedure and scientific methods are necessary is 
that such procedure and methods are indispensable 
helps to the avoidance of arbitrary inferences, and 
even with the best of scientific aids the tendency 
will sometimes operate. 
As a matter of fact, there is no reason to believe 
that the accuracy and reliability of such guesses 
as you and I and the character analyst make are 
very high. But there is reason to believe that if 
any character analyst does obtain even ten per cent 
of accuracy in certain special test cases, he very 
likely may not know how he gets his results, and 
may believe that he is getting them through his 
system, although he really is not. 
T have no doubt that those mind-readers, such as 
Bishop and MclIvor-Tyndall, who apparently at- 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  ,162 OLD AND NEW VIEWPOINTS IN PSYCHOLOGY 
tained striking results under test conditions, sin- 
cerely believed that they were reading minds di- 
rectly, and not through physical signs. Certainly, 
they could obtain those results only by ignoring the 
signs, and it may well be that they would not have 
been successful if they had known the actual nature 
of the process. I may mention here the observation 
I have made that the most successful hypnotists are 
those who have no scientific comprehension of the 
hypnotic process, but who really believe that they 
are exercising an occult power, or that some 
“magnetic fluid’? flows from their hands to the 
patient. 
On the other hand, it is true that we do, in much 
of our perception and thought, make use of signs 
effectively, although we are fully aware of the 
nature of those signs. In visual depth perception, 
to which I have already referred, we lose nothing 
in the perception of depth in pictures and land- 
scapes through an exact knowledge of the signs, 
provided we do not attempt to attend to those signs 
in the moment of perception. As another pertinent 
illustration I may point out that the knowledge 
that the thinking-process proceeds through mus- 
cular signs does not interfere with the vividness 
and the efficiency of thinking, provided we do not 
attempt to attend to those signs while thinking. 
It is therefore entirely possible that a scientific 
system of character measurement may some day
-P-A-G-E-161
  
  READING OF CHARACTER 163 
be developed. Such a system would be based on 
physiological, not on anatomical signs, and would 
necessarily be the result of extensive and prolonged 
experimental work. Even the development of such 
a system to the point of such relative efficiency as 
has been reached in mental measurements would re- 
quire years of work by many and highly trained 
investigators, just as the development of mental 
measurements has required. 
Although we do not know that it is possible to 
develop a science of character estimation, serious 
work in the attempt to find out is highly desirable. 
Even a definite negative result would be most 
valuable. In the meantime,.a respectable name by 
which this field of investigation might be known 
would be practically useful. The term ‘‘analysis’’ 
and its derivatives can no longer be used in psy- 
chology, because, thanks to the efforts of the 
‘*psycho-analysts’’ and the ‘‘character-analysts,”’ 
the terms ‘‘analysis’’ and ‘‘analyst’’ have come to 
connote superstition and quackery. In the mean- 
time, in the interests of the gullible public as well 
as the interests of psychology, both pure and ap- 
plied, we must carry on an educational campaign 
against ‘‘character analysis.’’

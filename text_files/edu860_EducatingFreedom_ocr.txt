EDITOR’S NOTE 
How shall we educate for freedom ? 
Within a few decades, the population of our country 
will number two hundred million. The per capita 
wealth, even though its recent increases may not be 
sustained, will undoubtedly be sufficient to warrant, 
for the great masses of the people, standards of living 
- and methods of enjoying life that were far beyond the 
reach even of the most favored individuals of the past. 
The marvelous advances in hygiene, sanitation, medi- 
' eine, and surgery clearly foreshadow a much longer 
- average lifespan, a progressively reduced hazard from 
. epidemic diseases, and a continued reduction of physical 
suffering. The applications of science to production 
and transportation give increasing security against a 
deficient food-supply. Indeed almost every present 
| sign promises for the Americans of the next generation 
"a measure of prosperity and progress that will far ex- 
_ ceed the wildest dreams of our predecessors. 
| But unfortunately not every sign justifies an optimis- 
| tic outlook. Science and education, working together, 
| have succeeded in lowering the death-rate from disease ; 
and yet during more than two decades the death-rate 
| from murder has mounted steadily until our country 
vu 
 
-P-A-G-E-9
viii EDITOR'S NOTE 
today far surpasses all other civilized nations in the 
proportionate toll of human life that it permits the 
assassin to extort. The number of persons killed by 
automobiles is a source of grave concern to our fellow- 
citizens; but last year the deaths from murder num- 
bered almost half the deaths from automobile accidents. 
We speak hopefully of the possibility that the legalized 
slaughter of war may cease forever; but if the present 
homicide rate is not diminished within the next four 
years more Americans during that period will die at the 
hands of assassins than were killed outright by the 
enemy’s shells and bullets during eighteen months of 
the bloodiest war in history. 
And what is true of homicides seems to be equally 
true of other serious crimes, Although minor crimes 
and misdemeanors have apparently decreased within 
the past few years, major crimes have increased out of 
all proportion to the increase in population. 
It would seem, then, that educating for freedom has 
some very definite and. conerete problems to solves not 
' fundamental law, and a keen sense of collective r responsi- 
bility for safeguarding the lives and possessions of the 
many against the venom or the rapacity of the few. 
It would seem, too, that continued prosperity and 
material progress are likely in other ways to make more 
difficult rather than easier an effective education for 
freedom. In a very real sense, wealth means freedom : 
freedom to travel; freedom from economic pressures

  EDITOR'S NOTE ix 
and worries ; freedom often to escape from the necessity 
of effort. and sacrifice. Our people are becoming more 
and more mobile with each succeeding year — and this 
moving about not only tends to lessen the influence 
of the home, it also tends to loosen the social restraints 
that go with a settled abode. Material prosperity 
encourages, too, a philosophy of life that intensifies 
individualism, condones gratification, and discredits 
renunciation. 
The school has been an important factor in making 
possible both the increased wealth and its more equi- 
table distribution. The school has also played its part 
in dethroning authority and superstition and enthron- 
ing freedom and reason. Can the school now provide 
effective safeguards against the hazards that increased 
wealth involves? Can the school develop rational con- 
trols of conduct that will exert in some measure at least 
the direct and powerful influence that authority and 
superstition once wielded ? 
It is needless to say that the problem of educating 
for freedom cannot be solved by setting the clock back. 
Of this reactionary character are certainly not the pro- 
posals that Dr. Sisson presents in the following pages. 
His proposals are constructive, upward-looking, built 
upon that firm faith in ideals which is the finest heritage 
of American democracy. If education can guide its 
works in the light of this faith, who can doubt that all 
will be well? But the works must be forthcoming, 
else the expression of faith becomes only lip-service ;

a gesture of righteousness ; of, if it goes a little further 
than this, 2 temporary reform of a superficial type — a 
collective effort of the body-politic, when it finds itself 
“in a hole,” to lift itself out by its bootstraps. Only 
education of a fundamental and pervasive type can. 
build a ladder upon which society can climb upward. 
It is the framework of such a ladder that Dr. Sisson has 
fashioned.

INTRODUCTION 
A XING in ancient Sparta being asked what boys 
should learn in school answered, “I suppose what, 
being men, they shall do.” Now science has come to 
confirm the native sense of the old Spartan: we know 
that children must be educated for what they are going 
to do — not for vague general ends, nor for a type of 
life that has passed away. But while we now know 
all this, it is slow work getting it into actual practice: 
the old theory soothed our minds with the comfortable 
assumption that it did not matter much what children 
did if only it was hard; when the new principle of 
' child nature came in, it further deluded the superficial 
into the supposition that education did not even need 
to be hard, but that any activity was good enough, if 
only the child could be lured into it. This, of course, 
is the fallacy of “soft pedagogy,” which furnishes 
weapons to the opponents of any change. 
But the real task of education, when once clearly 
comprehended in the light of all the knowledge of 
today, is harder than ever before. There is so little 
“transfer of training” ; learning to do one thing is on 
the whole more likely to hinder than to help in doing 
something else; so we are rigorously confronted with 
the necessity of educating children for the things which

children will just grow into competent, efficient, * 
devoted members of community and nation. 
this has not happened: the majority of all our tegal 
voters are unintelligent and negligent toward. civic 
duty; this is true of those who are keenly intelligent 
and business-like on other matters, especially their 
private business. Prevalent thinking and discussion 
concerning the essentials of American political life are 
notoriously confused and even ignorant: what free- 
dom, and equality, and democracy, and “American- 
ism” really are and what they demand in our individ- 
ual conduct — these are questions upon which our 
people entertain the most discordant views and follow 
the most antagonistic practices; and yet unity of mind 
and will in these matters is the sole safeguard of our 
national future.

    INTRODUCTION XV 
The lesson of Germany cries to heaven, but we are 
still so busy despising Germans and patting our own 
backs that we have no time for it. The Germans built 
their schools as they built everything else — admirably 
fitted to accomplish the chosen end: they had the most 
efficient system of education the world has ever seen, 
even by the testimony of those who were later their 
enemies in the Great War. Yet these wonderful schools 
did not gave them; on the contrary, their education 
worked hand in hand with their politics to insure their 
disaster. All the good we might ever have gleaned from 
copying their good points is as nothing in comparison 
with the value of avoiding their fundamental error: 
ng did everything but educate for freedom: we have 
to do that if we do nothing else. 
I make no apology for the sense of crisis running 
_ through the discussion: indeed, it seems that only 
complete blindness or resolute refusal to look at the 
| world could prevent any one from having this sense. 
The United States of America is being weighed in the 
' balances: if verdict had to be passed today, inexorably, 
on our freedom, on our equality, on our loyalty to 
the sentiments of the Declaration of Independence or 
to the passionate spirit of human liberty which domin- 
ated the birth of our national life; upon the active 
patriotism of the great, body of our citizens; upon the 
purity of our administration of government and the 
integrity of our public officials; upon our preference 
of God over Mammon, or of virtue over self-indulgence ;
-P-A-G-E-17

what would that verdict be? Few would dare t 
that we are as good as our fathers; yet I for one wou. 
do that much, and then add at once the* ***- *

spiring side of our condition. We cannot be too keen 
in our scrutiny of things as they are, nor too frank in 
recognizing every sign of our times, however ominous; 
in Heaven’s name let us not dwell in a fools’ paradise ; 
that is the besetting sin of the comfortable and well- 
to-do, of whom America has far more than any previ- 
ous great community in history. Perhaps we should 
thank God for wartime frauds and Teapot Domes, 
as gad-flies to sting us with a sense of shocking fact. 
To all this must be added a resolute and even obstinate 
faith: let us see, once forwall that, no matter how bad 
the facts are, the only unpardonable sin is in surrender- 
ing our faith in that still open field called the future. 
We have had from the idluminati too many “books of 
sneers” at American life: I have in mind now one such 
essay on the intellectual life of the United States in 
which the author declares that he was inclined to call 
his chapter “a study in sterility”; it is notable that 
conspicuous by their absence are nearly all the great 
names in American thought — Emerson, Walt Whit- 
man, William James, Henry George, and other great 
minds of our past; and all, with one exception, of our 
yet-living leaders of thought. This is an extreme 
case @ a widespread pernicious supercilious smartness 
at the national expense: this has no virtue except the 
negative one of kindling an irritation which may lead 
one to see the mischief in these wretched half-truths 
which are more than half falsehood. 
How much better if such Americans would read the
-P-A-G-E-19
xviii INTRODUCTION 
great patriotic essay, “Democratic Vistas,” by Walt 
Whitman — whom most of them profess to admire — 
and learn how to discern and denounce our national 
weaknesses, and at the same time burn with a passion- 
ate conviction of the promise and potency of American 
life! There is no lack of glory in our history, as well as 
shame; indeed, if one can get only one side, he had 
better take the glory, provided only he will not let 
mere tinsel pass itself off for gold: for the true glory 
of any country is exactly the other side of its faults : 
after all the glory must be the obverse, and the shame 
the reverse side of the medal. So I offer no apology 
for faith either: two classes of Americans must stand 
for the profound good in life, for its virtue, its intrinsic 
kindness, its admixture of self-sacrifice, its deep yearn- 
ing upward: these are the educator and, strange 
as it may sound, the politician; to them, above all 
others, comes the idealistic-practical counsel of the apos— 
tle, “Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things 
are just, pure, lovely, of good report; if there be any 
virtue, if there be any merit — think on these things.’” 
We may well adapt Foch’s dictum about war, and say 
that the soldier in the national crisis who can believe in 
victory the longest gains the victory. 
Then there is the crisis in education itself, as an 
agency in the evolving career of humanity. No one 
has put this more succinctly than H.G. Wells: “His- 
tory is becoming more and more a race between educa~ 
tion and catastrophe.” To which we must add the
-P-A-G-E-20
INTRODUCTION xix 
verdict of J. H. Robinson — after listing education 
as one of the failures of history — that after all it is 
education that we need, but an education so different 
from the traditional type that it should have another 
name. Whether he likes it or not, the teacher is “at 
’ bat’; the eternal riddle of the Sphinx is up to him. 
Everything else has been tried, and the answer is not 
yet; this is the deepest conviction emerging out of 
the War and its aftermath. It is startling to perceive 
how far the actual world of our own day has moved 
toward Plato’s prophetic declaration that education 
is the supreme concern of the state; only one step 
remains, of which more anon, that the philosopher 
should be called upon to rule. 
This universal call for education to become the savior 
of humanity began to manifest itself long ago, in a 
sort of instinctive or intuitive form, especially in the 
United States. This is the explanation of the huge 
expansion of the educative process in schools, which is 
one of the quiet but momentous phenomena of the 
past half century: elementary school, high school, 
college and university, and professional schools, have 
been growing like a huge plant, in size, in multitude of 
pupils in cost, and in public interest. This began 
with us long ago and for decades we occupied a position 
of world eminence in the field of education: now the 
new democracy in Europe and even in Asia has taken 
up the movement against all the odds of economic and 
social obstacles. It was a sort of tropism, springing
-P-A-G-E-21
xx INTRODUCTION 
out of the subconscious wisdom of the species: now 
it is flowering into intelligent and reasoned conscious- 
ness. May it not well be the dominant phase of the 
present epoch in human evolution as well as in history ? 
Thus teachers are being summoned into the arena of 
human life, the field of politics, in the broadest sense 
of this great word. They have long dwelt in a kind of 
seclusion, shut up with those small and weak creatures 
called children, and persistently encouraged, almost 
compelled, to think meanly of their function. What 
a vast gap between Napoleon contemptuously retort- 
ing to Pestalozzi’s appeal for an audience, with the 
remark that “he had no time for A, B, C stuff,” and 
the respect shown in war time to education, by both 
soldiers and statesmen. It is likely to prove a hard 
ordeal for the teacher; he is apt to make any one of 
three errors — either to rest in ignorance and indiffer- 
ence; or to cling to his traditional réle as a mere tool of 
the purposes of somebody else, church, or party, 
or business; or finally (very rarely, it is true, but 
when it does happen the effect is startling) to leap to 
the extreme and demand that he be clothed with su- 
preme and final authority, so to play providence both 
to education and human destiny. 
The real solution of the new réle of the teacher is 
happily by way of being worked out, and one of the 
greatest agencies, if not the greatest, is the new pro- 
fessional spirit and activity of teachers, as manifested 
in the epochal advance of their organizations in the
-P-A-G-E-22
INTRODUCTION xxi 
past decade. The National Education Association 
has already laid its hand vigorously to the national 
aspects of the problem, and many state associations are 
following rapidly in its lead. The teacher will have to 
think politically: the “A, B, C stuff” will continue to 
be taken care of, and that better than ever before: 
but the minds of professional educators will reach into 
many of the realms which Napoleon reserved to him- 
self; and doubtless far beyond the limits of his old- 
world apprehension. 
This new réle of the teacher, like all new truths, 
receives confirmation from various angles. His work 
used to be thought of as dealing with the individual 
and having for its end what might be called efficiency, 
or intelligence, or character, all thought of as inhering 
in the individual and unrelated to anything beyond. 
But our newer knowledge of human nature has abol- 
ished this notion of an isolated human being, with his 
separate intelligence and efficiency and character: 
we know now that the individual is an integral part 
of his community, and that his intelligence and charac- 
ter get their value and meaning from the social order 
of which he is a part. Education is not forming men 
and women to live in a vacuum, nor to be universally 
adapted or adaptable, but to live in their own place and 
their own time. So education must needs reckon with 
the social order — with political ideals, with constitu- 
tions, with laws and public morals, with the economic 
order, with social customs and institutions. This means
-P-A-G-E-23
xxii INTRODUCTION 
that education, and hence the educational worker, must 
reckon with the largest ends of life, and that these larg— 
est ends must ultimately determine every process down 
to the minutest details — even the “A, B, C stuff’’ 
itself. 
This is going to be a hard réle to play, especially for 
the great and increasing majority of teachers who 
work under the authority of the state. Here again 
we need to learn the lesson of German failure and be 
dissuaded from even wanting a body of teachers and 
a system of schools which know no duty except to 
instill and validate the ideas and purposes of the exist- 
ing political authorities: this way would lead to ruin 
for us no less than it did for Prussia and a Prussianized 
Germany. Already we begin to witness the demand 
for rigorous censorship over the instruction in the 
schools; not only political matters, but economic and 
even religious, are being agitated. It would seem 
incredible, except that it has occurred, that American 
commonwealths should enact laws which prohibit and 
prescribe instruction on strictly religious grounds. It 
would not be surprising if the arena of martyrdom 
should shift to the schoolroom! Yet this is likely to 
be a passing phase and of minor consequence, compared 
with the tendency of particular political and economic 
views to demand the exclusion from the school of what- 
ever is obnoxious to them. Here will come the tug of 
war for that freedom of education which alone can min~ 
ister to freedom of life and institutions.
-P-A-G-E-24
INTRODUCTION xxiii 
On the other hand the present marked tendency of 
the public to demand more school instruction in the 
principles of American life must be welcomed: no 
one who enjoys a close view of the occupation of 
school children, and has an opportunity to observe 
the substance of what they learn, can well escape the 
conviction that we have grossly neglected the political 
and civic phases of instruction and culture. If any 
organization wants the Constitution studied in the 
schools, it is but poor logic and still poorer policy to 
object on the ground of supposed ulterior motives: 
let us only see to it that the Constitution is well and 
truly taught, and that with it go other vital elements of 
American ideals, such as the Declaration of Independ- 
ence, the lives and utterances of great leaders in our 
national liberty, and abundant illumination of our 
social and economic life as it actually exists and as the 
principles of our history would have it exist. The fol- 
lowing chapters might almost be summed up as an 
endeavor to suggest some of the more important re- 
sources of the American teacher who desires to kindle 
and enlighten the spirit of liberty in the hearts of young 
Americans.

EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
CHAPTER I 
WHAT IS AMERICA? 
Epvucation deals with the future, of necessity; its 
returns are always deferred: in the individual, for 
a generation; in the nation, for periods or epochs. 
Crises occur before either success or disaster, probably 
long before and in times of quiet and security ; hence 
they tend to slip by undetected, and the menace shows 
itself only when it is too late to avert it. So it was in 
1914; so also in 1861; and doubtless the historian 
could cite unnumbered instances, great and small. 
Hence the supreme need for vision in the educator, and 
yet he is constitutionally given to “hindsight” ! 
Napoleon said, “Always consider yourself on the 
verge of disaster, to be saved therefrom only by the 
most strenuous exertions.” Just now, while still 
shuddering from the after-horror of the latest catas- 
trophe, it is not too soon, and we trust it may not 
be too late, for us to heed his maxim and at least 
suspect that a crisis may be here and now demanding 
our thought and action. The astonishing national 
solidarity of wartime is gone, and internal dissension 
— long familiar — lifts its head again. National unity 
3 ‘*
-P-A-G-E-29
4 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
is still an indispensable national need: at least a 
in peace as in war. The very progress bein; 
toward the banishment of international war is a 
a new solidarity within of a type which rises ab. 
level of the past, never requiring to be fired an 
by fear and hatred of the foreign foe, but self-sul 
and self-sustaining. The fatally wrong situatior 
of the German Empire, just prior to the War, in which 
the existing political order had to choose between war 
and revolution. 
The World War has effectively raised the question 
an organized system to end war — that is, to make im- 
possible even one more international “free-for-all”: it 
is quite certain that part of the main issue in American 
education will relate to this problem and consist in the 
extension of the conception of union and democracy to 
the inhabited world. For our present purpose let us 
note that if war-patriotism is to be eliminated, as men 
and nations now hope, it is high time to study and labor 
on the task of generating and invigorating that truer 
love of country that has no admixture of hatred or 
contempt for other nations or races and that truer 
unity which need in no wise cut us off from the wider 
sympathy with the whole race of man nor impede the 
broader citizenship which alone will guarantee interna- 
tional peace. 
The principle of political democracy is for us settled 
beyond all controversy, even though we are still far from 
the full attainment of government by the people, or even
-P-A-G-E-30
WHAT IS AMERICA? 5 
for the people: the flagrant inequality of chattel slavery 
was definitely wiped out, by a long struggle culminat- 
ing in the useless yet inevitable bloodshed of the Civil 
War.. Yet the main issue of Americanism lives on and 
is as shrewd a hazard now as in the Revolutionary War 
or in the sixties. Like Franklin, watching day by day 
the painted sun in the convention hall during the debate 
on the Constitution, we may still wonder whether it is 
arising or a setting sun: at least it would be folly indeed 
to sit in slothful ease, counting on the forces of nature to 
guarantee the full glory of our national destiny. 
What is America? What does America mean? In 
the midst of the startling assimilation of our social and 
economic order to that of the Old World, which we 
thought we had left behind, we must ask these ques- 
tions. What is to distinguish American life and institu- 
tions and American ideals and aims from those of any 
other land and people? Now as in Lincoln’s time, 
“if we could know where we are and whither we are 
tending, we might better determine what to do.” 
America is to be found in one place, and only one, and 
that is in the hearts of men. This one truth held to 
against all contrary solicitations will keep us safe from 
innumerable specious fallacies and bring us steadily 
toward the full truth. Our nation sprang from the 
deepest impulse of the heart of man: she was “con-

surpassing all its forms as much as the living man 
surpasses his clothes and his tools. 
Frederick the Great, in skeptical mood, it is said, 
once demanded of his old chaplain a proof of the’ 
scriptures in one word. However that may be, the 
issue of Americanism can be put in two words, taken 
from the original charter of our nation: those words are 
All Men. As the infinite manifold of the world’s flora 
and fauna has evolved from original protoplasm, so, 
one might almost say, the boundless richness of the 
distinctive characteristics of American common life 
evolves from this pregnant phrase. The Declaration 
is imbued with this idea: nowhere is any power ad- 
mitted superior to that of “the people” except Nature 
and Nature’s God; and contrary to nearly everything 
theretofore, government, of whatsoever sort, is the 
mere creature and tool of the governed. The pre— 
amble is a magnificent gesture, in which the authors 
turn away from the Royal Potentate, whom they have 
so long vainly petitioned, and address themselves, ag 
men, to mankind; the only obeisance, not of servility 
but of dignity, is that fine phrase, ‘a decent respect 
for the opinions of mankind.” 
The Declaration is not a variation, it is a mutation : 
the monarch whom they have been venerating — in 
words at least — becomes now a Despot against whom 
a long indictment in many counts is rendered. As one 
reads the impassioned utterances and realizes how 
recently most of the authors had been sincerely loyal,
-P-A-G-E-32
WHAT IS AMERICA? 7 
one is overcome with a sense of change in the very 
substance of polities: it is Homo politicus standing up 
on his two feet and looking all kings in the face with 
defiance. True, these men had had their first lesson 
from Englishmen in Stuart times, but they had assimi- 
lated the lesson so well that they had almost forgotten 
its origin, and moreover they were bettering the in- 
structions, for the good of Englishmen as well as Ameri- 
cans. 
Words that mean Man pervade the whole document : 
human events, people, mankind, men, the governed, 
the public good, representative houses, population, the 
civil power (versus military), and so on. Even the 
British people, in sharp contrast with the British King, 
are named only in kindness and sorrow as “our British 
brethren,” and blamed only for their blind support of 
the Tyrant: they, too, are after all, as men, “our 
common kindred,” and credited with “native justice 
and magnanimity.”” The deference and compliments 
long used toward kings are turned now to people, even 
when those people have failed to see the justice of our 
cause. 
The other great words of the Declaration and of all 
Americanism since then are mainly attributes of the 
subject All Men. Equality is the first, liberty the 
second. They are both intensely practical and dy- 
namic. How are we succeeding in linking subject and 
attributes even within the limits of our own national 
fold?
-P-A-G-E-33

The principle of equality is not a fact, it is a faith. 
‘All men are created equal,” says the Declaration: but 
of course all men are not created equal; on the contrary ; 
they differ immensely — in size, in form, in color, in 
strength, in intellect, in powers and capacities of all 
sorts; with these facts it is useless to quarrel. Un- 
fortunately the enemies of political equality are much 
given to twisting these facts to suit their arguments, + 
particularly by insisting that the differences between 
men are greater than the likenesses; whereas just the 
contrary is true — common nature is far deeper, wider, 
and more potent than all the differences. 
All history is against the doctrine of equality, as, of 
course, all history is always against any movement of : 
advance. The world has come thus far on an aristo~ | 
cratic basis. It is only a few years — perhaps fifty — | 
since the people in general got their first real attention 
from the writers of history, in Green’s “History of the 
English People.” Before that, history had dealt exclu- 
sively with the “supermen” — kings, emperors, gen- 
erals, conquerors; and even yet history is still pre- 
dominantly aristocratic. 
In other words, the national systems of the past have 
never been for all. There have been governments of 
the people by the rulers, and for the rulers. Thisis the 
law of nature ; it is in accord with biological life gener- 
ally, and based firmly on the actual inequality of men. 
It would be Utopian to suppose that any Declaration of 
Independence could put a sudden end to the deeply

founded natural oligarchy inhuman society, even in a 
new world. 
The biggest task for America is to keep the common 
everyday man in the running. It is small comfort to 
him to have been “born equal,” if when he wakes to 
the fact that he was once entered in the race, he has 
already lost all chance of winning even a place. 
So long as success, national and individual, is meas- 
ured in material terms, so long this infinite inequality 
is likely to persist. So long as the popular mind is 
fascinated and deluded and then infuriated by the 
spectacles of immense wealth and is led in a thousand 
ways to identify wealth and success, so long the ad- 
vance toward genuine democracy is barred. If rich 
men really are shut out of the kingdom of heaven — 
as the gospel seems to indicate — it is not a mere act 
of revenge, but because they themselves are disqualified 
in some way; they cannot pass the entrance tests; 
they cannot meet the requirements. Something 
utterly necessary they have failed to get. For the 
Kingdom of Heaven is within us, after all; that is, it 
is personality. 
The millionaire is cut off from the common life of 
man; he cannot share the hopes and fears, the modest 
ambitions of his hundred million fellow Americans. 
Most of the aims and plans that mean everything to us 
mean nothing to him. Two mortal spiritual dangers

Equality is the straight edge by which

polity is judged. Whatever the nation does as a 
nation, the state as a state, the county as a county, 
the city as a city — whatever any official unit of Amer- 
icans does officially — must square with the test of 
equality. This is what we call equality before the law 
and is presumably what the Declaration meant by its 
assertion that all men are created equal. In spite of all 
shortcomings and defaults — some of which we shall 
indicate shortly —it is probably safe to say that the 
United States and its constituent states have been far 
in advance of other’great governments in the degree of 
equality attained, provided we consider the period of 
our national existence as a whole. That we are now 
actually ahead might be questioned. Consider, for 
example, one single fact, dating from before the War — 
the presence in the British Parliament of a large group 
of workingmen, elected specifically to insure repre- 
sentation for their class. Since the War, evidences 
come almost daily of astounding advance toward equal- 
ity even in hitherto undemocratic quarters. Are we 
not now among the conservatives? 
Liberty means nothing except_as it embraces all. 
This was the logic which ceaselessly and inexorably

white. Everything, even economic necessity, had to

not the declaration that must reign. Freedom for all 
is necessary because it is the only guarantee for freedom 
for any: “In giving freedom to the slave, we assure 
freedom to the free — honorable alike in what we give 
and what we preserve.” <A society no more than a 
nation can survive half slave and half free. Without 
equality there is no law, any more than there is a tri- 
angle without three sides. The master was enslaved 
by his ceaseless struggle to keep his slave enslaved : 
still more clearly were all the “poor whites” of the 
slave states as hopelessly unfree as the black slaves 
themselves. It was this overpowering sense of the 
inexorable law of life that so fired the imagination and 
heart of the more conservative anti-slavery men, and 
underlay the first alarms uttered by Seward in his 
warning of an “irrepressible conflict” and the words 
of Lincoln when he predicted that the country could 
not endure half slave and half free. It was not in the 
nature of things that slavery could dwell in the land of 
the Declaration. 
Today, no less than in other days of our country, it is 
the immortal truths of the Declaration on which we must 
fix our eyes and by which we must be guided. Mere 
bandying about of phrases, however lofty and sacred, 
is worse than useless — every people with great ideals 
has suffered by empty and insincere “Fourth of July” © 
oratory. Not patriotism, as cynical Dr. Johnson said,

lent, empty liturgical repetitions in speeches and 
national songs pass with millions of honest men -for 
“one hundred per cent Americanism.” We have 
heard much of “calamity-howlers”; one may hazard 
the guess that “prosperity-howlers” are quite as 
dangerous. Let us condemn in the same verdict the 
malcontent who denounces everything as all wrong, and 
the smug patriot who insists that everything is perfect.

well as in those closely associated values — life and 
happiness. It is the fashion to deride equality as 
scientifically absurd and economically undesirable or 
impracticable, and nothing is easier than to make out 
good logic for both of these: it was easy to prove the 
utter inequality of the black slaves, and the history of 
the negro since emancipation affords no little warrant 
for the arguments. Yet the people of the United States 
by overwhelming majority did decide to give the blacks 
at least the deed to freedom and equality ; and in spite 
of Ku-Klux, reconstruction, race wars, and the still 
unsolved negro problem, they have never for a moment 
changed their minds: they knew then and know now 
that it had to be done. We are now engaged, with 
many vicissitudes, with ebb and flow of waves but 
inexorable advance of tide, in extending the bounds of 
both equality and freedom. The present problem is 
certainly no easier than that of the sixties, and prob- 
ably far harder, but it is our problem which we cannot 
evade. 
Another great attribute of Americanism, a fitting 
third to equality and liberty, is union. Not explicit in 
the Declaration, it was born from it, or rather from the 
same stormy crisis which bore the Declaration itself. 
It is the “given name” of our country, as an adjective 
in our official designation, and as a noun when we speak 
of the Union. The idea of union was born hard, and 
had a rather feeble and precarious youth, culminating 
in the terrific malady and surgical operation of the
-P-A-G-E-41
16 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
Civil War: since which, politically, it is the giant o 
the world in strength and vigor. The first official com: 
pact, the Articles of Confederation, of luckless memory, 
began with a warning against too much union —' 
“Each State retains its sovereignty” ; but in spite of all 
vigilance the last paragraph contained the indispensable 
germ of the future by twice declaring the Union to be 
perpetual. And, as every one knows, the Constitution 
proclaims that its purpose is to form a more perfect 
union. The arbitrament of the great Civil War was 
prophesied by Webster: “Liberty and union, one and 
inseparable, now and forever!’ Can equality be 
brought in, too? 
Political union is an accomplished fact: thirteen 
petty colonies were united into the first feeble national 
body; now forty-eight mighty commonwealths are 
grown into indissoluble organic oneness. This is 
probably the greatest phenomenon of a union of multi- 
tudinous individual wills into a “general will” which 
the world has yet exhibited. It is a momentous spec- 
tacle and may well turn out to be a model for political 
units yet in embryo. So much for the task done — 
the binding of many states into one nation: next, the 
greater problem —the task not yet accomplished, 
indeed not even set or stated until but yesterday — 
the binding of a hundred million free men into a social 
union. This is the problem of the Union today. In 
this problem at least we may expand the formula of 
Webster and announce: “Liberty, equality, and
-P-A-G-E-42
WHAT IS AMERICA? ‘ 17 
union, one and inseparable, now and forever.” For 
the Declaration set out only to achieve liberty and 
equality, believing these the guarantee of life and hap- 
piness in man. Union came as the means to these 
ends. As a means it is of course mechanical and sub- 
ordinate; yet it may easily turn out to hide within 
itself an even deeper human truth than either of the 
others. What if liberty for man, and equality too, were 
organically bound up in the higher unity with his fellows 
of which political bonds are but the garment or form? 
The main issue for America is multiplying liberty, 
equality, happiness, by a hundred million. This is the 
rigorously logical inference from the Declaration’s 
subject, All Men. Whenever the process is multiplica- 
tion, the proof is division, and the proof of the success 
of America is found by dividing by a hundred million 
and examining the quotient. No, this does not mean 
anything so simple as a distribution of dollars, equal 
or otherwise; it is neither socialism nor communism 
in their political form. Jf socialism or communism 
should appear to be the true mechanism for the fullest 
multiplication of liberty, equality, happiness among 
our hundred million people, then the Declaration itself 
would require us to adopt that mechanism. Only let , 
us remember that liberty, equality, happiness are all 
states of human souls and not outward social or political 
forms. Whosoever would be a true promoter of the 
vision of the Declaration must keep the nature of man 
in mind, and most of all must the teacher do this.

The dominant group in America — the business am. 
professional men, employers, college professors, big an 
little “taxpayers,” the “ better-dressed class” as 
careful writer has called them (or us) — are in the gri 
of a hazardous fallacy: that they are the people o 
America; that they are the All Men of the De-'---+* ~~ 
The fallacy is partly naive and unthinking 
mostly so, for a large proportion of the indi’ 
this group are men of honor and good feeling whd 
really intend to be first-class citizens in eve . 
It is partly rather stupid and bull-headed 
wide-awake and deliberately autocratic. 
Fortunately we can here refer to a great 
book, dear to the hearts of many of our | 
particularly to the “better-dressed class,” : 
of which is really an exposition in vivid ar 
form of this domination — I refer to Theoc

corollary so easily reached that even laws 
have no right to balk him from his aims. < 
to induce liberal rereading of this Odyssey ot vital 
Americanism, let us quote the “prominent law 
who took the young crusader in hand on the very 
round of his political ladder and explained that it 
time for him to drop the “reform play,” at which h«

succeeded so well, “leave politics and identify himself 
with the right kind of people, the people who would 
always in the long run control others and obtain the real 
rewards that were worth having.” 
The worst of this philosophy of life is that it is fifty 
per cent true; it is another example of the universal 
fact that a hundred per cent lie is never very dangerous 
for the simple reason that it promptly refutes itself. It 
is the same sort of perilous fallacy as Douglas’s doctrine 
of the negro being divinely ordained to be a slave, or 
the present contention that labor is not wise enough 
nor unselfish enough to rule even its own affairs. 
Tf Roosevelt is already obsolete — as he certainly is 
in some degree — let us take a modern instance. There 
is, or at least was less than a year ago, an organization 
whose very name is a synonym for the All Men of the 
Declaration and whose announced aim is “to bring 
together all self-respecting, law-abiding, God-fearing 
Americans, of whatsoever political predilections or 
religious faith, rich and poor alike”; yet out of one 
hundred sixteen names of officers and members printed 
in the prospectus, including scores of persons of na- 
tional or wider note, not one is listed as having any 
connection with the greatest of all national groups, the 
so-called working class, and not a single one in the list 
could by any stretch of the imagination be called 
“poor” — except in the grotesque sense of the word as 
used by millionaires. Yet in the list are several names 
of secretaries of certain associations which are looked
-P-A-G-E-45
20 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
upon, rightly or wrongly, by labor men as the enemies 
of labor organization and labor aims. By all means 
these men should be in an All-American association, 
but by all means they should be balanced by an abun- 
dant representation of the extreme other end of the 
social or economic scale. This is in no sense intended 
as a reflection upon the honesty and sincerity of the 
great association or of the men directing it ; on the con- 
trary, it is meant to show that even the best of motives 
and highest of aims do not avail to correct the organic 
bias of operative thought in their class. 
Let us sharpen the cutting edge of the issue, using 
again the potent authority of Theodore Roosevelt : 
“By the time I became President I had grown to feel 
with deep intensity of conviction that the fight was 
really for the abolition of privilege; and one of the first 
stages of the battle was necessarily to fight for the rights 
of the workingman.” (Autobiography, p. 476.) These 
are strong words — nouns, adjectives, verbs: batéle 
occurs once and fight twice, and an absolute ultimate 
abolition of privilege —four verbal blows to denote 
intensity of mental action. So far as the world knows, 
Roosevelt died unrepentant of any of these utterances. 
Only one other American thus far in the twentieth 
century can compare in achievement and in public 
esteem with Roosevelt — Woodrow Wilson; whatever 
may be their differences they agree here. They both 
fought the Invisible Government, which was privilege, 
usurping political sway; as Roosevelt wielded the Big
-P-A-G-E-46
WHAT IS AMERICA? 21 
Stick against privilege, Wilson characteristically speaks 
in idealistic terms, “The awakening of conscience has 
extended to those who were enjoying special privilege.” 
The italics in the type are Mr. Wilson’s; for our pur- 
pose in quoting we should italicize conscience. We may 
well assume that the Big Stick cannot yet be laid aside, 
but also that the final victory will never be won except 
by conscience: if only those who still enjoy privilege 
will awake to conscience, the Republic will be saved. 
Here is the present crux of our national life and of 
the vital reality of our faith and loyalty to the Declara- 
tion of our fathers, in Roosevelt’s words, the abolition 
of privilege and the defense, or rather progressive crea- 
tion of the rights of the workingman, or the common 
man, or the vast majority of the All Men of the charter. 
If another mighty national conflict comes, here is where 
it will arise, and if it arises it bids fair to dwarf all 
previous struggles by comparison. Unless the Ameri- 
can citizen is educated to this, all the rest of his training 
and culture is in vain. 
If any one doubts the pervasive existence still of 
privilege and inequality, let him read “Justice and the 
Poor,” written by an expert jurist and published by the 
Carnegie Foundation. If any one is unaware of the 
passionate sense of injustice among the working people 
themselves, let him read even the most conservative 
labor papers and note what they say of courts, of legis- 
latures and congress, of injunctions and strike-breaking 
processes. After making all the admissions in the world
-P-A-G-E-47
22 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
of the mistakes and misdeeds of workers and labor organ- 
izations, we might better adapt the motto of the big 
store, “The customer must be satisfied,” and make our 
national motto, “The man who does the work must be - 
satisfied.” The plan works well in business: why not 
in national life? 
If I am to be an American, my vision of my own indi- 
vidual private fortune must yield in brightness and 
power to my vision of my country, free, happy, united, 
prosperous. The majority of our citizens now are 
habitually “absent without leave” in the duty of 
politics: often they take a shallow and pitiful pride in 
thus holding aloof. At the other extreme are the peri- 
odic revelations of respectable Americans pro-**-*7—~ 
political processes to their own selfish ends 
example, buying seats in the senate; or actuall: 
the country which they profess to love — as.in

comes of course only when our self-interest

liberty is one who, in the words of Lincoln, de

test of our loyalty to freedom itself comes when they 
propose to use their lawful freedom to do what we dis- 
like or condemn. Much use has been made of a well- 
meant but vague term, “hundred per cent American” ; 
one is tempted to put nitric acid on any supposed 
sample in some such form as: ‘Do you want one hun- 
dred per cent of the people of America to enjoy life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, in some degree 
comparable to your own situation? Will you refuse 
to profit personally at the cost of your city, your state, 
or your country, even though scores of others are doing 
it? Will you take time out of your business, even at a 
loss to yourself, for the common good?” And so on 
ad libitum. If you can rank on these tests, you may 
aspire to an honorable grade in that noble. character

CHAPTER II 
REFOUNDING DEMOCRACY 
“ AMERICAN democracy was founded on an abundance 
of free lands”: so says the most authoritative student 
of the pioneering march of our people from Atlantic to 
Pacific. In other words, liberty was easy, almost com- 
pulsory, in all the early experience of our political 
experiment: if any man felt hampered or oppressed, all 
he had to do was to move west and find freedom; be- 
yond the ridges was, not rest, which he did not want, 
but freedom, which he did want. How far he should go 
depended upon how intense was his desire for liberty : 
he could secure complete isolation from all artificial 
restraint, if he so desired, just by going on to the fron- 
tier: he could secure any intermediate degree by halt- 
ing in the westering settlements. So the human flood 
spread out toward the new lands, distributing itself 
by a sort of gravity, the conservative and stable ever 
dropping out and settling, the eager and adventurous 
pushing on toward the plains, the mountains, and 
finally the sunset ocean. But always freedom beck- 
oned, and open spaces gratified the impulse: nature 
allowed no bottling up of discontent; men who were

satisfied stayed and created satisfied communities ; 
those whose temperament called for something different 
trekked on to find it. Best of all, “Uncle Sam was rich 
enough to give every man a farm’; this was an un- 
heard-of glory, the full meaning of which is understood 
only by remembering that landownership has always 
been the most basic patent of nobility: if an English- 
man’s house was his castle, an American’s quarter- 
section of land was his kingdom. 
Gone forever are these incomparable favors of his- 
‘tory. Gone is the free land, not merely in its abun- 
dance but in its last remnants : the occasional opening of 
an Indian reservation, about the only exception to the 
rule, really accentuates the main fact and tends to keep 
alive the hunger for land and so render the shortage the 
more acute and dangerous. Land which will actually 
produce crops is everywhere and always high priced, so 
that the demand gnaws hungrily on the outer edge at 
the barren or unavailable areas. “Cut-over” lands, 
encumbered with dead logs and huge stumps, are sold 
at a price which forty years ago would have bought 
fertile prairie soil; then the buyer must expend money 
and labor in clearing it, far beyond its actual produc- 
tive value when cleared: it is a common saying that 
it takes three successive holders to conquer such land, 
the first two wearing themselves out and quitting in 
despair. , 
As free lands contributed to free men, indeed created 
a natural state of freedom, so did free natural wealth

in other forms — timber, and minerals, in particular. 
Parallel +o the homestead laws are the laws concerning 
mineral and timber claims: the western half of the 
national domain abounded in rich gifts for the ambitious 
citizen: hundreds of thousands of individuals thus 
attained ease or even affluence at a stroke. The 
majority of fortunes in the Rocky Mountain and 
Pacific regions are founded, directly or indirectly, upon 
such gifts of freedom. This too is gone, almost without 
a trace. The generation now in middle life have, in 
the main, never had an opportunity to use their 
“vights” for a timber claim or mining claim: most of 
them never give a thought to either, unless incited 
thereto by promoters whose only interest is the fee 
which they exact for putting the claimant in possession 
of his legal rights— and usually the new possessor 
finds his new property worthless. 
These resources are gone in two ways: the actual 
material is in large measure consumed and possession 
is tied up for nearly all the rest, partly by the enter- 
prise of great corporations or large single owners who 
have industriously gathered titles into their hands; 
and partly by the wise but tardy reservations made by 
the government, through which the nation resumes 
ownership and control of a remnant of its original 
resources. 
The actual exhaustion of the material is the most 
significant of the changes: for so long as material is 
abundant it creates economic ease and freedom,
-P-A-G-E-55
30 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
largely regardless of ownership; that is, even when 
ownership is consolidated, the actual material abun- 
dance tends toward good wages and abundant employ- 
ment. The exhaustion of timber may serve as illustra- 
tion: “The original forests of the United States,” says 
the World Almanac for 1922 (p. 220), ‘covered about 
822,000,000 acres and contained 5,200,000,000,000 
board feet of timber. There are left, (June 30, 1921) 
463,000,000 acres of forest land, containing 2,215,000,- 
000,000 board feet. Of this 112,000,000 is culled and. 
second growth timber, 133,000,000 is partially stocked 
with smaller growth, and 81,000,000 acres is devastated 
and practically waste land. The present rate of timber 
consumption is more than four times the annual growth 
of the forests.” 
In the place of a population always open toward the 
west, always free to move when dissatisfied, never 
“cribbed, cabined, and confined” in body or soul — 
what have we now? Huge aggregations of humanity 
in cities, especially in industrial and commercial cen- 
ters, dammed up by their economic and occupational 
condition, almost unable to move at all, and with no 
place to move to which will hold out promise of better 
or even materially different conditions. Most serious 
of all is that the family, least of all, can move: the 
solitary individual, especially if a male, can get out in 
one way or another: if he lacks the price of a ticket, 
the ties or the brake-beams offer free transportation ; 
but consider the spiritual price of such exodus, and
-P-A-G-E-56
REFOUNDING DEMOCRACY 31 
compare its dehumanizing influence with the dignity 
and almost epic nobleness of the pioneer family crossing 
the prairies, with the father leading, the mother and 
small children in the covered wagon, in company 
usually with a whole train of self-respecting and 
respected fellow Americans, engaged in a career which 
belonged to the very character and genius of the 
national life. The history of the United States pre- 
sents few more startling and menacing changes than 
that of the moving population from the wagon trains of 
the great trails to the motley, incoherent, semi-human 
dribblings of hobos and tramps to and fro from East to 
West and from North to South. The moving of the 
pioneer knit the family in stronger bonds of unity, and 
formed the firm centers of community solidarity: the 
movement of the freedom-seeking laborer today in the 
main dissolves the family bond and engenders estrange- 
ment or even hate in the individual against the Great 
Society to which he should and must belong. 
Thus the primitive and natural basis of our natural 
liberty has been clipped and shrunken, all by the most 
natural causes, all in the inevitable spirit of exuberance, 
fostered. by nature’s generosity both in our blood and 
in our wealth. The material side of this great na- 
tional experience has been enlarged upon abundantly, 
though certainly not too much: every intelligent citi- 
zen should be familiar with it. But it is certain that 
few of us are seized with even a trace of its significance 
in our national welfare and in the determination of
-P-A-G-E-57
32 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
political, social, and educational policies. Above all 
is it necessary to concentrate our minds upon the 
human side of the great metamorphosis going on and 
strive to comprehend how it is changing the very con- 
ditions of our life and, most of all, the facility or even 
the possibility of true liberty. 
Consider also the transformation in the character of 
daily occupation, in the color and psychic tone of the 
hour-long and year-long engagement by which the 
worker earns his. living: in other words, the industri- 
alization of the population. As the disappearance of 
free lands and free natural resources has diminished 
and in large measure abolished freedom of movement, 
so the change in the type of occupation has involved 
profound psychic transformations in the main flow of 
the worker’s occupational existence. “In the needle 
trades a girl tends a sewing machine carrying twelve 
needles making 4000 stitches a minute, or 2,400,000 in 
ten hours, often working in a bright light and with 
unshaded eyes, and amidst a deafening roar. In the 
shoe industry a workman revolves the shoe in such a 
manner as to trim off the crimped surplus lea|” 
the upper. His task is 5200 shoes a day.” 
tions like these have become familiar through countess 
reports of industrial commissions and are known to all 
intelligent persons. Happily our minds are becoming 
awake to the acute question of the bearing of these 
changes upon our social and educational procedure 
The political and educational moral of all this is
-P-A-G-E-58
REFOUNDING DEMOCRACY 33 
demand for a new foundation for democracy. The 
abundance of free lands is gone, never to return; the 
abundance of material resources is shrunken and has 
quite lost its unique economic influence upon spiritual 
life and character. The dull pressure of economic 
necessity is settling down upon us, and the huge weight 
of industrialism is already acting with tremendous force. 
“Nature’s” prodigal gifts to the cause of liberty are 
fast being withdrawn: the material environment no 
longer makes freedom inevitable, but rather threatens 
here as in older cultures to render it difficult, almost 
impossible. It is the urgent task of political and edu- 
cational wisdom and energy to create the new basis of 
liberty: a spiritual foundation instead of a material 
one; human instead of “natural”; permanent, or at 
least. enduring, instead of the transitory one of the 
historical accident of enormous stores of land and 
resources. 
The old basis, the abundance of land and resources, 
was ready-made for us, the gift of history and geogra- 
phy: the new foundation is our own task; we must 
create it ourselves, out of our own souls as it were. It 
is one of the natural demands of maturity: our patri- 
mony is spent, in the main; how wisely spent is an- 
other question, but spent it is. Now we shall build 
our own fortune. In place of immense advantages for 
the solution of comparatively small and narrowly 
limited problems, we now have a harder economic situ- 
ation and infinitely expanded and multiplied problems.
-P-A-G-E-59
34 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
It is nationally a “man’s job,” which is after all what 
a nation should want. 
Of all things most futile is talk about going back. 
Whatever in the past is really sacred will be found to 
be still with us, not left behind at all, but keeping pace 
with the movement of our own times, and indeed run- 
ning ahead of actualities in the form of ideals and aspira- 
tions. The great Declaration of the equality of men 
belongs to the thus far unattained: going back into 
history carries us farther from it than we are now, by 
just so many years as we retrace. Whatever in the 
past, our own or anybody else’s, cannot find a place 
in the main stream of our present actual life will have 
to be surrendered. We cannot go back to the simple 
colonial type of life of our own early history: if we 
really understood its limitations, we should be loath in- 
deed to do so. Least of all can we go back toward a 
feudal Europe, with its classes and masses, and every 
individual man or woman exhorted to “be content in 
the station wherein God hath placed him.” Europe 
itself is writhing out of that coil fast enough, but with 
no little loss of skin. 
What, then, are the positive forces to which politics 
and education may look for the creation of the new basis 
of democracy? In brief we may answer, the impulse, 
the conviction, and the habit of freedom. These are 
genuine spiritual forces; and therefore also cosmic 
forces. They powerfully affect the conduct and his- 
tory of a people, and of the world. They mark the
-P-A-G-E-60
REFOUNDING DEMOCRACY 35 
American people far more characteristically than any 
other traits. The politician and the educator must 
endeavor to rise to the peculiar type of vision required 
to perceive and comprehend spiritual realities like 
these: they must seek to attain the faith required to 
believe in them and trust to them, in spite of popular 
clamor ever on the side of materialism; in this respect 
they must understand that the very people who are 
misled by the clamor have nevertheless a truer second 
sense for the realities and will in due time come over 
to them. 
There can be no doubt about the “principal merid- 
ian” of all surveys and courses: it is the thing we call 
democracy, and, under that protean word it is what the 
general run of Americans, high and low, learned and 
unlettered, come back to in unity of understanding — 
something hard to define logically, yet easy to point to 
in history and individual conduct: it is freedom; it is 
the consent of the governed ; it is equity if not equal- 
ity in the social order; most fundamentally it is the 
worth of man as man, which embraces the whole 
trinity of democratic faith —liberty, equality, and 
fraternity. 
The impulse of freedom in the history of the United 
States has been much stressed but is in no danger of 
overemphasis. Free blood has been drawn off from 
Europe ever since the coming of John Smith and of the 
Mayflower. True, some doubt may be cast upon the 
genuineness of much of our later immigration: espe-
-P-A-G-E-61
36 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
cially that part of it which has been practically imported 
volens nolens to meet the demands of industry. Great 
is the responsibility of those forces and those individ- 
uals who have carried on this importation of what, 
in a very true sense, corresponds to the importation of 
. slave labor into a free country. Yet even these ele 
ments in our population respond in wonderful measure 
to our ideals and cannot be set down wholly in the 
debtor column of our eugenic account. As for the 
great bulk of the voluntary immigration of all periods, 
we must assume a predominant strain of freedom. 
The conviction of liberty is a crucial fact in our na- 
tional present and future. Our people in the mass are 
pervaded by an ineradicable sense of human equality. 
The public school system has enormously fostered this 
sense, as also have our political customs. No descrip~ 
tion can do justice to the democracy of American public 
education. True, our school population is still sifted 
out largely on a social and economic basis: the children 
of working people, in vast majority in the primary 
grades, fall below their proper representation in the 
grammar years, and shrink into relative insignificance 
in high school and college. But this is not the work of 
the school itself, but of the social order. In the main, 
and with no exception worth mentioning, the public 
school, from primary grade to university, is the whole- 
hearted apostle and minister of democracy. Nowhere 
else in the world has ever been found a great institution 
harboring in its membership so many millions of human
-P-A-G-E-62
ee 
rR ST 
Se een ee REFOUNDING DEMOCRACY 37 
beings so nearly on the basis of the great Declaration, 
that all men are created equal. Nowhere in history 
except here have twenty million individuals lived in 
such equality, not only of opportunity, but of actual 
treatment. Nowhere else have so many, or perhaps a 
tithe so many, been so free from the discriminations 
usually effected by varying wealth, privilege, social 
rank. 
Moreover the school has assiduously indoctrinated 
its members with the ideal of equality in its simplest 
and most unequivocal form. That every boy might 
become President, became a favorite joke, but it was 
long pretty much in earnest; and it was discarded’ 
only in form, for the same fundamental idea is still 
a potent part of the instruction and order of the 
school. : 
Every politician, official or unofficial, is really com- 
pelled to minister to this sense of equality and worth: 
the demagogue differs only in the crude and fulsome 
manner he uses and the base ends he seeks. “Though 
fiends and all things ill should wear the brows of grace, 
yet grace must still look so.” The reason why the 
demagogue appeals constantly to the ideal of equality 
is just because the people he appeals to are so deeply 
in love with that ideal. Our political system itself 
necessarily acts as an education in the sense of de- 
mocracy. The lesson of “one man one vote” teaches 
itself silently and vocally, campaign after campaign, in 
all kinds of elections and public procedure.

forests and mineral wealth: it is more real than they 
were; more capable of endurance, for it grows by 
use and is expanded by exercise; more vitally related 
to our destiny, for it is the essential energy for demo- 
cratic institutions, while the rich material resources 
simply offered an easy field for preliminary exercise of 
the faculty. But woe to us if we neglect or abuse this 
inheritance: it is truly sacred and may not be despised 
or tampered with: this spirit of liberty in equity will 
save us equally from the tyranny of autocracy, political 
or economic, and that other tyranny which tends to 
spring from the fierce reaction of the long-oppressed 
. when once their hands feel the access of power over the 
system and the individuals through which the oppres- 
sion was exercised. Those who seek to discredit or 
undermine the spirit of freedom sow the wind, and in 
whatever measure they succeed shall we all reap the 
whirlwind. 
Here we face again the enduring problem of national 
destiny — the national character and the national 
life; the souls of the people and the social order; the 
kind of persons and the form of the common life. So 
far as we are concerned we have these hundred million 
human beings infected with the impulse to be free and to 
be worthy; unwilling to be servants, at least of other 
persons. Out of them the national order must be built. 
The work of building the national order is politics in 
the widest and truest sense of that noble word; the 
work of perfecting and adapting the character of the
-P-A-G-E-65
40 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
individuals is the work of education — again in the 
widest sense of the term. Politics and education are 
indissolubly linked together, so that neither can suc- 
ceed in any large way without harmony with the other ; 
if you would have a social order, you must have men to 
fit it; then, when you have your social order, it reacts 
upon the growing children and makes them in its own 
image. National efficiency lasts while the social 
order and the education support each other; internal 
disaster ensues when they clash; national success and 
survival depend upon the fitness of the social order and 
the national character to meet the demands of the world 
in which the nation exists. Germany was a striking 
example of a nation kept marvelously efficient by 
forced harmony between education and the prevailing 
national order, the autocracy; but the new type of 
individual, the social democrat, was long threatening to 
upset the autocracy; the clash between the German 
order and the larger world anticipated the internal 
clash — and later precipitated it. 
It really seems that the American politician and the 
American educator should both consider these vital 
problems; and yet it takes a vast heave of faith to 
believe that they will do it. Is it possible that actual 
politicians, the men (and now women) who hold office 
and discharge public functions, may get some pungent 
conviction of Plato’s great truth, that education is the 
principal business of politics? Is it possible that 
educators — including “teachers’’— may get some
-P-A-G-E-66
EEE REFOUNDING DEMOCRACY 41 
effective sense of the truth that the final aim of their 
work is to be found only in the life of the nation as a 
whole, with all its millions of individuals and all its 
complex problems and issues? 
But in a democracy all are politicians and all are 
educators: we must appeal to all to take these questions 
into their minds and hearts. Certainly not all will do 
it: but some are doing it now, and more will. In 
manifold forms the ideas are permeating the whole 
body politic, and the practice of individuals and com- 
munities is reacting powerfully. 
The socialists are right in insisting upon attention 
to economic conditions: we must however insist that 
economic conditions are important, not because they 
are economic, but because economic conditions turn 
into spiritual conditions. The politician needs to get 
a new sense of the passing over of material conditions 
into psychic. The tariff has enormously stimulated 
industrial development: but industrial development 
has completely transformed the soul of the worker, and 
set new problems for both politics and education. The 
politician must get the habit of reckoning the spiritual 
bearing of economic measures: he must go beyond 
trade balances, pay rolls, bank clearings, building per- 
mits, farm mortgages, and all such, to men and women 
and children, to hopes and fears, to ambitions, to ani- 
mosities and affections, to contentment and joy, to the 
inner heart of patriotism. 
Government itself is bound to recognize the problem.

CHAPTER III 
NATIONAL AIMS IN AMERICAN EDUCATION 
WE must get down to actualities with regard to the 
value and genuine effect of schools. On every hand 
those engaged in the tasks of industrial and social life 
sum up by declaring: “In the last analysis it is a prob- 
lem of education.” This is likewise the standard argu- 
ment used by educators in demanding greater resources 
for the schools. Both are right, and both winning their 
point to a limited degree. But we shall have to go 
deeper into the relation of education to human affairs. 
What has education to do with history, after all? Can 
any one believe that teachers, of all people the most 
unpolitical and simple-minded, drilling their pupils in 
spelling and pot-hooks and the multiplication table, 
can affect the destiny of a nation for weal or woe? 
We have a national plague of mob-violence, a crying 
disgrace to our country, a blot on our honor; no one 
denies it or condones it; can education do anything to 
breed a generation who will be-too wise and too strong 
to unleash their brutal passions at the call of the herd, 
or to bring it to pass that there will nowhere be enough 
mob-men to make up a mob? There is nothing to 
45
-P-A-G-E-71
46 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
indicate that education has yet touched the evil; it 
still persists, bursting out anew at every new incitement, 
fairly indifferent to the race or color of its victims, if 
only they are unpopular and weak. Reading and writ- 
ing and arithmetic and even civics and economics and 
psychology have not availed. Is there any real remedy? 
Is this really a problem of education? Well, we shall 
never know until we attack the question of finding out ; 
our present methods are like the incantations of the 
savage; what we need is the science and experiment of 
modern medicine. Why should we doubt that human 
intelligence properly applied may solve lynch-fever as 
well as yellow fever and typhoid? It may well be a 
problem of education ; but not of the sort of education 
now in vogue. 
Mob-action is perhaps more a symptom than a dis- 
ease; partisanship is probably a disease, with many 
symptoms. On February 26, 1923, the daily press car- 
ried a report on the President’s proposal for the United 
States to enter the international court of justice: 
“Democratic senators,” it said, “chortled with glee 
over the problem created on the Republican side by 
the President’s message, and lost no time in jockeying 
for political advantages to be gained from -the situa- 
tion.” All of which sounded like an inverted echo 
of the senate’s reception of a Democratic President’s 
message on the League of Nations. No American, not 
even the men who “chortled with glee” while a vast 
human problem was being muddled, really approve the
-P-A-G-E-72
. 
NATIONAL AIMS IN EDUCATION 47 
existing national situation in such matters; four days 
before, the nation had been celebrating Washington’s 
birthday and rereading his warning against the ravages 
of party spirit. Is this an educational problem? If 
so, of what kind of education? 
These are simply two samples, taken almost at 
random, of the sort of national evil which is declared to 
be a question of education. Far be it from me, as a 
teacher, to enter a plea of incompetence for education ; 
on the contrary, I agree heart and soul with the verdict. 
But it is self-evident that our present operations under 
the name of education are not curing or even mitigating 
these evils, and others that will occur to every reader’s 
mind; it is quite possible that our present procedure 
may be unwittingly playing into the devil’s hands. 
We cannot guess the right methods, still less fake them ; 
we should entertain no hope that history will teach 
them to us, for it is unlikely that they have ever yet 
been discovered or practiced. Our case is new, and 
we shall have to think anew and act anew. 
We have used negative examples, citing certain 
flagrant evils in our body politic, but the remedy of 
evils is in no manner fundamental; the basic problem 
is positive and constructive ; 7 is the breeding and train- 
ang of the true type of free citizen. If we can get the free 
citizen as the dominant type of our population, not 
only will evils abate, but what is far more vital, the 
beauty and power of life will rise to new levels and the 
hopes of our liberty-loving ancestors be fulfilled. But
-P-A-G-E-73
48 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
only the good man can be the good citizen, as Aristotl 
taught, and if this was true for the imperfect democrac, 
of Greece it is doubly true for our times and our naticn. 
So the American school is face to face with the mighty 
task of fostering good men and women who may fill the 
réle of good citizens. The problem is subtle, even 
vague and almost formless, but the solution will have 
to be definite and concrete; we shall have to do certain 
particular things in certain particular ways at the 
appropriate times and places. The answer will have 
to be worked out, with ceaseless deliberation and study, 
immense coéperation, patient experimentation, just like 
other great human tasks. Is any problem i in education 
more fundamental than this? 
Out of the welter of war and after-war at least one 
clear lesson stands out: it is not political nor economic 
nor social, but educational, yet it is little thought of 
and likely to be lost. It is the plain conclusion to be 
drawn from the now rounded-out educational experi- 
ment of Germany. From somewhere early in the 19th 
century, perhaps 1820 to 1914, Germany possessed the 
most effective school system the world had ever seen, 
by which we mean that the school accomplished what it 
set out to do — just this and nothing more; not that 
it was the best, or wisest, or most admirable, but that 
it was efficient. 
An astounding yet almost unnoticed educational 
fact: the Prussian minister of education in 1851 
banned the kindergarten from the kingdom! This is
-P-A-G-E-74
NATIONAL AIMS IN EDUCATION 49 
the very devil’s hoof of autocracy betraying itself in 
the most unexpected place: why ban the kindergarten? 
Was it not a German institution with an incurably 
German name, which almost defies translation? Did 
it not confine its efforts to babies under school age? 
Was it not the dream of a harmless, innocent, pious 
enthusiast? What was its crime, that the mighty 
engine of the Prussian government was turned against 
it, that the royal “Kultusminister” should abolish it 
from its native soil? Yet the minister was absolutely 
correct, for the kindergarten in all its childlike inno- 
cence contained an antidote for Hohenzollernism; His 
Excellency probably would have called it poison. That 
element was freedom: the kindergarten, by its very 
name, was a place for children to grow according to 
their spiritual nature; the only school Prussia could 
tolerate was one in which children were trained on the 
Prussian model, which was vastly different from the 
spirit of the kindergarten, or the Sermon on the Mount 
either. 
Germany paid the price of educational efficiency. 
No undertaking was too formidable for her resolution, 
no detail was too petty for her attention. All children 
went to school every day and were totally subservient 
to the rigid discipline of both school and home. Every 
teacher was trained for his work before he was allowed 
to enter it, and then he became a state official with 
life tenure, quite independent of the whims or anger of 
the persons whose children he taught. All courses of
-P-A-G-E-75
50 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
study were worked out by state authority, with the aid 
and advice of everybody whom the state desired to 
consult, but with all final decisions absolutely reserved 
by the authority. All schools, public (which were 
nearly all) and the few private schools, were held rigidly 
to the prescribed standards of matter and method. 
The keen interest of parents was insured by making 
success in school the only avenue to success and ad- 
vancement in life; all the best places in state and 
church demanded educational qualifications; every 
profession required a long standardized preparation ; 
even the mechanic arts and commercial pursuits offered 
success mainly to those who had studied in the special 
schools provided. Yet nobody wants this German 
education ; even Germany herself has radically trans- 
formed it. Herein lies the clearest lesson of Germany 
and the war: efficiency is not enough. On the con- 
trary, if an education is not right, the more efficient it is 
the worse may be its final results. 
German education knew what it was doing, and did 
it well, but it was the wrong thing thatit did. So 
Spartan education knew what it was doing, and did it 
well, but that too proved to be the wrong thing. Both 
fell, in spite of efficiency. Athenian education was 
terribly at sea, and was far less efficient than Spartan ; 
yet the Athenians far surpassed the Spartans in, keen- 
ness and intelligence. Athens fell, too; but, as Pericles 
so eloquently showed, the Athenians enjoyed a rich and 
glorious life while it lasted, and, as we now know, left
-P-A-G-E-76
NATIONAL AIMS IN EDUCATION 51 
the world an incomparable heritage. The answer to 
this puzzle is not hard to find: Sparta aimed her edu- 
cation by the well-established principles of the existing 
world-order and so avoided the perplexities of progress ; 
Athens, on the contrary, had the vision of a new order, 
involving the most difficult task of the race, the giving 
of freedom to all her citizens. It was too hard a task, 
but the failure was more worth while than Sparta’s best 
success. 
American education in comparison with German 
education before the war is random and chaotic: not 
because we are less intelligent, but because we have 
set ourselves the harder goal. Even now, after-war 
Germany is attacking the same harder task. The au- 
tocratic order came first in evolution because it was 
easier to practice and easier to train for. The demo- 
cratic comes now because it is better, although far 
harder to practice and harder to train for. That is our 
problem and we must face it. 
Age-old stratified society, with its supermen and 
submen, has always been challenged by the spirit of 
human freedom. This is no place even to outline the 
course of this conflict, but every American who aspires 
to be intelligent concerning his country must clearly 
perceive the struggle between ‘“‘the divine rights of 
kings, and the common rights of humanity.”” Democ- 
racy, to those who believe in it, means the refutation 
of the old order and the beginning of the new. We 
should understand how sharp is the contradiction
-P-A-G-E-77
52 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
between them, and how impossible any reconciliation. 
Consider the scorn and horror with which a Hohenzol- 
lern or a Romanoff would regard the sentiments of the 
Declaration of-Independence or the institution of uni- 
versal suffragg: and on the other hand the indignation 
with which the free citizen of a modern democracy 
would resent the suggestion that he and his class were 
inherently inferior to some other group and properly 
subordinate to that group before the law. 
Yet the pre-modern world was organized under 
autocratic forms; for tens of centuries mankind lived 
in stratified communities — probably ever since he 
emerged from brute savagery, perhaps always since he 
became man at all. These centuries have left their 
mark deep on the nature of man: they have been his 
education thus far, and habits of mind and action 
proper to an autocratic order have struck their roots 
in his very soul and body. The ruling powers of the 
past have never desired to educate citizens, but to train 
subjects. Hence the traditional school is anti-demo- 
cratic. It reached its zenith in the German system 
just prior to the World War; the pupil asked no ques- 
tions; the controlled school “told him all he needed 
to know”; the state decided what and how much he 
needed to know. 
In America we are at handgrips with the old tradi- 
tion, which is mighty even here, and our national 
future hangs upon our success in creating a truly 
democratic education. While politics is struggling
-P-A-G-E-78
NATIONAL AIMS IN EDUCATION 53 
with the problem of organizing liberty in laws and 
administration, education must labor to breed it into 
the spirits of the young with the hope that each genera- 
tion may surpass its predecessors in the capacity for 
freedom. This is the most fundamental problem of 
American education. 
Who are the free? What is the mind of a democratic 
citizen? What habits and ideals qualify a man or a 
community for liberty? These are vital questions for 
all who concern themselves with education, and most 
of all, those who direct the public schools of our country. 
Perfection in a thousand details will be of no avail un- 
less our basic plan is right. America beyond all other 
nations has the tradition of liberty. Our history and 
our institutions trace back at least to Magna Charta, 
and their original stream flows down through the Eng- 
lish Civil War and the Commonwealth of 1649. The 
dominant elements in our colonial populations had left 
the old countries in order to seek more freedom. Our 
Revolution in its day was clearly the advance move of 
political liberty, and was recognized as such by the best 
elements in England itself. Not a single one of our 
national heroes is even tainted with autocracy, and all 
the greatest were passionately devoted to freedom. 
In these respects our heritage is incomparable: this 
does not guarantee success, but it would make any 
failure the more tragic and unpardonable. 
There is danger that both political and educational 
leaders should think the task easy, when in truth it is
-P-A-G-E-79
54 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
one of immense and probably increasing difficulty ; th 
main question now is whether we can possibly achiev 
the solution in time to meet the inevitable crisis; wit 
us, too, history is “a race between education and catas: 
trophe.” The moving picture of history is speeding up 
terrifically, as though some demon of lightning change 
had got hold of the projector and was turning the film 
with reckless energy. It is easy to be wise after the 
event, but that is too late: the business of human 
intelligence is nothing else except being wise before it is 
too late. The use of history is successful prediction : 
aside from this, history is mere diversion, and the 
times are too earnest and hasty to permit much of this. 
Can we picture ahead for our own country? Let us 
mark the points which history gives us, and see whither 
the lines run. In 1775, we had three million people ; 
in 1920, a hundred million: where does the line of pro- 
jection lie? What will our grandchildren have? How 
many of them will there be? Will they live in cities? 
Will they still hang or burn those who annoy them 
very much? 
The educator and the politician will have to sit down 
together : the problem concerns them both, and neither 
can solve it alone. As things are, the politician has 
usually hardly been inside a school since he was grad- 
uated: yet in most cases he has a set of firm convic- 
tions about education, and too often he feels qualified 
to reform it by drastic legislation. The educator has 
been given to understand that his full duty in polities
-P-A-G-E-80
NATIONAL AIMS IN EDUCATION 55 
is to cast his vote, if he so desires, but abstain from air- 
ing his views on any political issue. This simply will 
not do: it was all right in Prussia, where there was one 
will in the kingdom, but it can never be right or safe in 
a democracy, where there are as many wills as there 
are men and women. 
The politician should know from his experience better 
than any one else what are the defects and weaknesses 
of our present body politic; and he may well form a 
clear idea of what changes are needed in men’s habits 
and ideas to remedy political evils and attain true polit- 
ical success. The educator should know, by his train- 
ing and experience, better than any one else, how the 
young may be trained toward the needed qualifications 
for citizenship. If these two elements of expert knowl- 
edge and skill can be brought together, we shall be on 
the road to a solution of the problem of liberty. So 
long as politician and educator go their separate ways, 
cross-purposes and failure will continue to result, and 
the success of our democracy will continue to be in 
hazard. 
Whither shall we move? First, to insure a true 
vision of America, for every young American: this is 
the supreme and paramount objective of the American 
school. To this objective we can permit no question 
or obstacle: if we cannot attain this, the rest is of no 
account. No matter how crowded the curriculum, 
way must be made for this, and a broad and generous 
way at that. Heaven knows there is dead wood
-P-A-G-E-81
56 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
enough yet to be cut from the course of study to mak 
room for much vital and generous culture of tru 
patriotism ; and how the hearts and minds of boys an 
girls will wake from the dead remoteness of irrelevan 
erudition to the issue of freedom and the principles o 
Americanism ! 
We must find new and potent means to indoctrinate 
every school boy and girl with the love of liberty, equal- 
ity, fraternity. Our long devotion to the idol of indi- 
vidual success is bringing us to the brink of ruin. 
Whether by accident or intent we have bred a citizenry 
who have in the mass refused to let politics interfere 
with business; we must breed a race who will under- 
stand that politics, the business of all, is supreme over 
all other mundane affairs. America has been a place 
where poor boys became millionaires and presidents ; 
and the millionaires, being more numerous and less 
modest than the presidents, have got more attention 
from the rising generation, and have sadly distorted 
their views of life. The school has not been much to 
blame, except through dereliction in preventive and 
constructive action. It has mildly aided and abetted 
the potent forces of the world-stream, and has failed to 
sense its own countervailing mission. 
We must renew our allegiance to the original charter 
of our nation, the Declaration of Independence: our 
pupils must grasp its political philosophy with their 
intelligence, and thrill to its humanistic idealism with 
their hearts. “No virtue is safe that is not enthusi-
-P-A-G-E-82
NATIONAL AIMS IN EDUCATION 57 
2 astic.” As in the days before the slavery conflict, so 
now again we are being tempted to ignore and even to 
deny the challenge of that bold document: to modify 
and scale it down in the interest of expediency, com- 
fort, prosperity, and such other inducements as the 
tempter is wont to offer. It is well to understand once 
for all that the Declaration, unlike laws or even con- 
stitutions, is not subject to amendment, but only to 
fulfillment: it is the prophecy and program of the 
America that is yet to be made — and, we trust, of the 
world that is to be.

CHAPTER IV 
EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
Ir we would know the fundamentals of American 
education, we must seek the fundamentals of American 
life, and surely nothing is more fundamental than the 
spirit of freedom. It was this spirit that resisted the 
Stamp Act and threw the tea into the waters of Boston 
harbor; that fired the momentous shots on Lexington 
Common and drove the British regulars back to Boston 
“with their tongues hanging out of their mouths like 
dogs”; that wrote the Declaration of Independence, 
and-finally wore out and crumpled up the royal forces 
on land and sea. But for this passion to be free there 
would have been no revolution, no independence, and 
no United States of America. A fit education for 
American citizens will have to lay this spirit in the 
very foundation of its theory and practice; every 
educator needs to keep his heart attuned and his mind 
accordant to this master-key, and shape his practice 
by it day by day. It will of necessity cut deep into 
the question of ways and means in our schools and 
in that far more potent nurture which is bestowed by 
life in general, in the home, on the street, in shop and 
61
-P-A-G-E-87
62 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
factory and counting house, and in the social and po- 
litical activities of the nation. 
We are too prone to take this spirit for granted and 
assume that nature will provide our children with the 
spirit of freedom without any ado on the part of the 
educator. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
A free society is so difficult a creation that it has never 
yet been achieved. Our own republic almost broke 
down, in the decade following the Revolution, and was 
saved only by the genius and superhuman efforts of its 
leaders. Slavery marred our body politic for nearly 
ninety years after the Declaration of Independence. 
Even today the government considers it necessary to 
hold men in prison for their opinions. Freedom is 
new and history is against it. The past was all auto- 
cratic, and the habits of mind fitted for autocracy have 
sunk deep into the very natures of mankind. We are 
building the new order, and it is radically different 
from the old ; the spirit of freedom is its most essential 
distinction. 
It is almost impossible for the democratic man of the 
twentieth century to understand how completely the old 
world was ruled by authority. The consent of the 
governed was the last thing thought of. The common 
man had one supreme duty —to obey: “his not to 
reason why, his but to do and die.” Church and state 
both issued orders, and the ordinary individual had 
only to conform. Crimes were not confined to overt 
acts, but the laws prescribed even the thoughts of
-P-A-G-E-88
EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 63 
men’s hearts and mercilessly punished illegal opinions ; 
dungeons, torture, and the gibbet were often the reward 
of what is now the first virtue of humanity — in- 
dependent thought and action. The word “heretic,” 
whose very sound was a death knell, filling the mind 
of the hearer with unearthly hates and shuddering 
fears, has really the most simple and noble signifi- 
cance: it is just the Greek word for one who chooses 
for himself. 
Cases like that of Galileo exemplify the arbitrary 
rule of external authority even over men’s opinions. 
Years of patient research and the aid of his new device, 
the telescope, had led him to the clear perception of a 
great, new truth——-that the earth was just a sister 
globe of the stars, floating in the immense spaces of 
the cosmic voids. Today every child learns this with 
the letters of the alphabet, and every fragment of 
human knowledge is related to it; in that day the con- 
stitutional authorities denounced the proposition as a 
damnable heresy and the old scientist escaped burn- 
ing only by a formal recantation. The most casual 
reading of the story gives a picture of a world with 
an immense machinery of government and church to 
suppress thought, in startling contrast with the scat- 
tered and fragmentary beginnings of the search for 
truth which has since grown into the vast system of 
modern scientific investigation. 
Galileo’s final trial and conviction occurred in 1632, 
only four years before Harvard College was founded.
-P-A-G-E-89
64 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
What a forward leap civilization had taken when the 
American Constitution decreed that “congress shall 
make no law. . . abridging freedom of speech and the 
press!’ We need not wonder that even now and even 
in America, reaction sometimes balks the full operation 
of the new freedom. . 
Thus histery has exalted obedience and conformity, 
with the corollary of having some one else do your think- 
ing for you... Every man went out into life to occupy. a 
station provided for him, under authorities, and in some 
cases over others; life consisted largely in obeying and 
being obeyed — with much more of the former, for the 
few gave orders and the many obeyed. The church - 
and the school, the two great. educational agencies, 
magnified the virtue of obedience, and the social order 
was absolutely built upon it. It was a world of au- 
thority and orders; mankind was stratified into, many 
levels of rank, with those in any rank obeying the 
ranks above and domineering over the ranks below. 
The system worked well. All the achievements of 
the past are due to it. It was the very genius of war 
and government, and it became the essence even of 
ecclesiastical polity. What more striking illustration 
could there be than the building of the great pyramid 
of Cheops, upon which 100,000 men worked for twenty 
years? Picture the scene, with the gorgeously arrayed 
imperious commander surveying the whole operation 
and dominating every part; the skillful and dignified 
engineers, masters of the lost art by which the vast
-P-A-G-E-90
EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 65 
stones were conjured into their lofty places; the host 
of foremen and overseers — armed with scourges to 
apply to the naked backs of the sluggards; and then 
the innumerable horde of human beasts of burden, 
sweating at their hopeless toil under the torrid sun. 
This is the kind of world that ancient history should 
tell us about, for it was the real ancient world for the 
vast ‘majority of mankind. Even in “free” Athens, 
the slaves and serfs outnumbered the “free,” and the 
free themselves were in truth far less free than modern 
men of liberty. 
Considerations of this sort regarding the history of 
the race lead us to one of the most important facts 
concerning liberty, that it has never yet been achieved 
except in the most limited and partial forms. Until 
the most recent times the mass of mankind have 
always lived in subjection: primitive man was slave 
to blind instincts, and the impotent victim of the 
forces of nature — beasts of prey, famine, pestilence, 
hostile tribes; early civilization developed an upper 
crust of order and beauty, with a ruling class, an 
esthetic culture, and the beginnings of knowledge and 
the practical. arts; but still the huge silent majority 
were enslaved by ignorance and servile labors, and even 
the ruling classes were robbed of true freedom by the 
very task of holding the masses in subjection, by virtue 
of the inevitable law that the master is enslaved along 
with the slave. This picture may be repugnant to the 
prevalent spirit of worship of the supposed “golden
-P-A-G-E-91
66 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
ages” of Greece and the Renaissance, but it has two 
great virtues — first, it is true to facts, and, second, it 
is full of hope and courage for the future. It is time to 
cease mourning over past splendors and present degen- 
eracy, for these are both illusions of perspective; let 
us instead “consider the pit out of which we are 
digged,”” and have faith in the evolutionary process in 
human progress, which has but begun. 
Another great truth concerning freedom is that 
its character is not negative but positive; the mere 
absence of undue restraint is but the preliminary condi- 
tion of liberty; liberty itself is rich, donative, expan- 
sive; it consists of the abundance of life, the full exer- 
cise of powers, the generous satisfaction of desires, the 
filling up of capacities, the ever expanding realization 
of potentialities. To achieve this liberty is a colossal 
task, to which charters and constitutions are but the 
prelude, and for the full achievement of which all sorts 
of wisdom and skill and righteousness must codperate 
~— political, economic, social, educational — with the 
aid at every point of all knowledge and virtue. This 
conception of liberty is put into the most concrete and 
practical form by Edward Filene, when he writes: 
> “No man is truly free unless he has more than enough 
with which to purchase the necessaries of life for him- 
self, his wife and his children.” It is expressed in the 
noblest philosophical form by Spinoza: “The final end 
of the State consists not in domination over men, 
restraining them by fears, subjecting them to the will
-P-A-G-E-92
EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 67 
of others. The State . .. has for its end so to act 
that its citizens should, in security, develop soul and 
body, and make free use of their reason. Hence the 
true end of the State is liberty.” 
Almost all men, here as elsewhere, are willing to ad- 
mit these truths when expressed in general terms and, 
in America at least, few would venture to object even 
to the concrete form in which Filene puts his definition. 
What we need is to apply these definitions as a measur- 
ing rod to the actual state of our own country and 
honestly face the facts thus revealed. For example, 
how many million American citizens, in the persons of 
migratory workers in basic industries, not only do not 
have “enough with which to purchase the necessaries 
of life for wife and children,” but are barred by the 
inexorable conditions of their life from the possibility 
of even aspiring to have wife or children? Again, to 
turn to Spinoza’s definition, how many of our people 
taken as a whole, of our hundred and ten million 
men, women, and children who make up the true 
United States of America, are now “restrained by fears, 
subjected to the will of others — unable in security to 
develop soul and body and make free use of their 
reason?’? The sum of the answers to these questions 
is the measure of the arrears of American freedom. It 
is unprofitable to spend too much time in blaming 
somebody either rich or poor for the deficiency: the 
main question is not who is to blame, but rather what 
is the way out. The true lover of American freedom
-P-A-G-E-93
68 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
will be deeply moved by these facts and will be firmly 
resolved to devote at least some of his energies and 
his wealth, if he have any, to the remedy of the 
ills and to the fuller realization of our freedom. 
Let us face this principle squarely, that every Ameri- 
can child is to be trained to love freedom, to rebel 
against oppression, to resist tyranny, to prefer death to 
bondage. This is a radical proposition, but one which 
no loyal American can reject. The republic cannot 
now any more than in the ’sixties “endure half slave 
and half free” ; we must still be all one thing or all the 
other; and we must all be free, or soon we shall all be 
slaves. Let us be perfectly frank with ourselves and 
recognize that the Patrick Henry type is calculated to 
fit very poorly into a good many niches of the modern 
social system. Teaching children the Declaration of 
Independence is bad training for flunkey and menial 
occupations — although it has not the slightest tend- 
ency to divert men from the most laborious and 
perilous tasks, if only they may keep their self-respect. 
The pathetic plaint of the luxurious that our education 
is ruining the “servant-class” is probably well founded 
from the point of view of the complainants; but it is 
doubtful if the occupation of the traditional valet or 
butler or footman is good training for the free citizen- 
sovereign of the republic. 
Far more serious is the manifest tendency of native- 
born Americans to abandon whole fields of labor to 
alien hands — a tendency arising in a perfectly natural
-P-A-G-E-94
EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 69 
manner from the clash between the American’s pride 
of freedom and self-respect and certain Europeanized 
phases of our economic and social order — too large a 
topic to be discussed here. Yet in spite of all these con- 
siderations, no American community would dream for 
one moment of Europeanizing its schools and its general 
culture, in order to replenish the supply of ladies’ maids 
and get a liberal strain of underlings in the populace ; 
instead we may better agree with the wise dictum, that 
the cure for democracy is more democracy, and work 
for a reduction in the demand for underlings instead of 
an increase in the supply. 
So we must lay it down as basic that the American 
school must foster the child’s natural tendency    
noble instinct ; nothing must be allowed to weaken his 
self-respect or diminish his sense of personal worth. 
These elements are of the very essence of Americanism, 
and American education must nourish and invigorate 
them. This is the exact opposite of the basic principle 
of Prussian education, from Frederick the Great down 
to 1918 — when the Prussian school and all its works 
came to its final inevitable fruitage of disaster. The 
school domineered over the pupil, silenced his ques- 
tions, dictated his thoughts and his very words, and so 
labored to make him what the state required, an obe- 
dient subject of king and kaiser and a faithful adherent 
of the church. All the virtues and excellencies of the 
Prussian school, all its thoroughness and discipline, its
-P-A-G-E-95
70 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
perfect order and intellectual perfection, its model 
organization and wonderful efficiency — all these could 
not atone for the sin against freedom nor avert the 
final calamity. There is no more momentous lesson 
in the history of education than this. The American 
educator and the American statesman cannot afford 
to miss one jot of its meaning. 
But the problem of freedom in education is as diffi- 
cult as the problem of freedom in life. The old way 
was so simple, so direct, so efficient, at least at times. 
It seemed easy to find one man to fill the great position 
of king or a small select number to be consuls or trib- 
unes or lords; it is so infinitely difficult even to imagine 
a people who are all fit to wield sovereign power, and 
that is exactly the final demand of democracy. It is 
no wonder that even Russia, bent on out-democracying 
democracy, falls over into another form of autocracy 
with the few again dictating to the many. No wonder 
that business and industry, and even the schools them- 
selves, are still operated in the main upon a scheme of 
autocratic control; no wonder that so many men, even 
among those who really love liberty, when they look 
upon the actual facts of life and see the imperfection 
and failure of democracy, are tempted to lose faith and 
react from the more liberal provisions of the Constitu- 
tion itself, such as the guarantees of freedom of speech, 
press, and assembly. It was the same flagging of 
faith that led Washington’s officers to propose that 
he assume the crown, and that brought from Hamilton
-P-A-G-E-96
EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM val 
the bitter complaint, “Your people, sir, is a great 
beast !” 
Happily, Washington, aristocratic though he was in 
certain respects, was too good a democrat to consider 
for one moment the rash proposal of his old comrade 
in arms, and happily Hamilton’s scathing criticism 
could not cancel the prophetic utterances of the great 
declaration. The way out is forward; freedom must 
not become less, but must become wiser; the common 
man cannot be deprived of his sovereignty, but he must 
be equipped with the intelligence and unselfishness 
which are the only correctives of the evils and excesses 
which have so often marred the conduct of democracy 
and wrecked the earlier attempts at free government. 
But we must expect that infinite faith and patience will 
be the price of success. And the educator must con- 
tribute his share, far more fully than ever before. 
The great question for both politics and education is 
just this, “How shall the love of freedom be guarded 
from degenerating into either license on the one hand 
or tyranny on the other, and rise to achieve true lib- 
erty?” There is only one answer, that the love of 
freedom must transcend the narrow limits of selfishness 
and become generous and all-embracing in its scope. 
The true lover of liberty not only desires to be free him- 
self, but he desires to ‘‘see all men, everywhere, free.”’ 
From infancy up to manhood the child must think 
of the freedom of those about him. He must under- 
stand the simple fact that his own liberty is guaranteed
-P-A-G-E-97
42 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
only by the liberty of his fellows; that his rights are 
eternally linked to his obligations; that he cannot be 
free alone, and that he dare not exclude any human 
being from the enjoyment of liberty without thereby 
renouncing the most sacred traditions of his country. 
So, while the school, along with other educational 
agencies, is fostering the child’s natural impulse toward 
freedom, it must also enlighten him as to the only 
possible way in which his freedom and the freedom of 
all can be conserved. He must learn that to live in 
liberty is to live in order. That the only perfect free- 
dom is found in perfect law. The school is an admi- 
rable practice ground for the exercise of this principle, 
but historically the school has not been conducted so as 
to attain this particular benefit. It is today moving

life, the plan affords unique opportunity for practical 
training in free government. 
The third means is found in the o course of study itself, seo meena ene cer mame

and especially in history. To the future American 
citizén the most important history is not of Greece or 
Rome, nor of western Europe; it is the story of human 
freedom. Even in our own history “there is constant 
danger of getting lost in minor details and missing 
the most vital facts and ideas. Yet every period of 
civilization has its lessons for the student of liberty. 
Socrates, living four centuries before Christ, was the 
pioneer in the struggle for freedom of speech and teach- 
ing; yet it is to be feared that the great majority even 
of college graduates could not give the slightest account 
of his trial and death. The greatest need is for a far 
deeper and more reflective study of our own history ; 
the mere incidents and narrative are of little value 
for civic education; it is absolutely necessary to dwell 
upon the relations of cause to effect, and especially the 
influence of human actions upon events. But, if this 
is to be done, either the time must be greatly increased, 
or rigid selection must be exercised and much material 
omitted which now consumes time. 
The ever pressing question of freedom of teaching 
is vitally related to the teaching of freedom: indeed, 
teaching must be free mainly because freedom must 
be taught. There is a general impression that freedom 
of utterance is primarily a right of the one who desires 
to express his ideas; -it is true that freedom of thought 
is an indispensable necessity of human life, and that 
free utterance probably ministers to free thought. 
But the most vital aspect of the question is the other
-P-A-G-E-100
EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 75 
side. The main question at issue is not freedom of 
speech but freedom of hearing; not freedom of the 
press but freedom of reading; not freedom of teaching 
but freedom of learning. Freedom of utterance affects 
primarily the one individual ; freedom of hearing affects 
many scores, hundreds, thousands, even the whole citi- 
zenship of the country or the people of the world. 
Practically it was a matter of small consequence that 
a speaker of the Non-Partisan League should be pre- 
vented from delivering his speech in a Minnesota town 
or village, but it was a matter of immense consequence 
that a hundred or a thousand free citizens of the United 
States in that place should be prevented from hearing 
the discussion of grave political measures that touch 
their most vital interests. The outrageous character 
of the lawless measures taken to bar the speech is due 
to its violation of the freedom of the citizens in general, 
not merely to the duress perpetrated on the would-be 
speaker. The people of the communities apparently 
failed to perceive the gross impudence of the small 
groups who assumed censorship over what their fellow 
citizens should have the right to hear. The self- 
appointed censors probably even deluded themselves 
with the shallow fallacy that their violence was prac- 
ticed mainly upon an outsider. In the great North- 
west, the great body of citizens were robbed of their 
freedom of hearing for months, during the very period 
when they were approaching elections in which they 
were to determine issues under discussion.
-P-A-G-E-101
76 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
Practically, it is of small moment whether a particu- 
lar newspaper or journal is permitted to continue the 
kind of publication it is devoted to; individual injus- 
tices are regrettable and should be reduced to the small- 
est degree, but they are certain to be an integral and 
unavoidable part of any system of government until 
human nature and social organization have moved 
much farther on the road to perfection. But it is a 
matter of supreme moment for the people of a democ- 
racy to be denied the right of reading the fullest and 
freest discussion of. all questions in which they are or 
ought to be interested. When one man, or any group 
of men, official or non-official, can censor the reading 
of the people of the United States, it is mere verbiage 
to call the people free. At this very time, the people 
in general are becoming profoundly disturbed at what 
they believe to be the bondage of the press of the whole 
country to certain interests. They believe they are 
being misled and misinformed on issues of vital concern 
in the country and in the world. 
Practically, it is of small moment whether any par- 
ticular teacher is permitted to teach freely what he 
desires to teach; it is of immense concern whether the 
children and youth of the democracy shall be permitted 
to learn freely on all subjects which affect their welfare 
as human beings and as citizens of a free country. As 
for propaganda in the schools, freedom is the only sure 
remedy ; the Prussian school is the champion example, 
in all history, of a propagandist school and at the same
-P-A-G-E-102
EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 77 
time a school completely dominated by government 
control. If press reports are correct, the Soviet govern- 
ment in Russia is again proving the general principle 
that if you want propaganda on either side, you must 
exercise autocratic control. 
Thus the whole issue comes back to something that is 
the basic condition of success in democracy — freedom 
of thinking, and freedom of thinking for all persons on 
all subjects. There is no thinking without data and the 
only safety lies in opening wide the channels of infor- 
mation — spoken, written, printed, or expressed in any 
other medium whatsoever. Let every man utter his 
message as he will, subject always to the proper 
laws against misrepresentation, obscenity, fraud, and 
slander. Let every citizen hear, read, see what he 
desires, as the only possible condition under which he 
can study and decide the questions of his life and 
conduct. Above all, let every child and youth have 
the possibility of learning the facts and apprehend- 
ing the principles of all subjects of human thought 
and intelligence. 
This is an essential part of the price of democratic 
education; it is probably the hardest part of the price 
for our present social order to pay ; against it is arrayed 
the whole organic residue of the old system of control 
from above which was always ready to take the short- 
cut to the control of conduct by assuming the control 
of ideas and opinions. The beneficiaries of the estab- 
lished order in all its fixed laws and customs will be
-P-A-G-E-103

fearful of the disturbing effect of new ideas or indeed 
any ideas except those which they in their wisdom 
have censored. All this is abundantly in evidence in 
religion, polities, economics, sociology. Yet the policy 
of control and suppression of ideas is a denial of democ- 
racy and is in contempt of the court of democracy — 
the people as a whole. Furthermore — and would that 
the advocates of repression might perceive this before 
more mischief is wrought — repression bears plenti- 
fully the fruits of suspicion, distrust, antagonism, 
and finally revolt. Let us come back at once to the 
perennial wisdom and nobility of the maxim of Jesus: 
“Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you 
free.”

CHAPTER V 
EDUCATING FOR UNION 
WHEN once the colonies had won freedom from the 
yoke of George III, union was the object which en- 
grossed the minds of the leaders of the new-born nation. 
The Articles of Confederation were also articles of 
“perpetual union.” The phrase occurs three times in 
the short document, once in the first line, once in the 
solemn pledge in the last article, and again it forms the 
very last line just before the date and signatures. The 
Constitution strikes the same key note of union. To 
the true American what utterance can be more signifi- 
cant than those opening words of our national charter, 
“We, the people of the United States, in order to form 
amore perfect union” ? This was the proof text which 
vindicated the nation against the claims of secession. 
The union these patriots were thinking of was a 
union of states, and later years showed how just was 
their anxious attention to this great national object 
and their repeated stress upon the perpetuity of the 
union. In spite of all their devotion and vigilance, the 
union was virtually severed for four years and was 
reconstituted only by the horrors and agony of fraternal 
warfare. 
81
-P-A-G-E-107
82 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
The union of states into the one nation, perpetual 
and indissoluble, is now secure beyond even a breath 
of question. However warm our devotion to our 
several states, our final and supreme loyalty is to the 
federal union. The problem of union has shifted from 
one of the binding of states into a federal nation and 
has become the greater task of binding 100,000,000 
human beings into a spiritual unity. The Constitution 
plainly forecasts this as the true union, for it is the 
manifesto of the people. The evolution of our national 
experience has turned all eyes to the nation. The 
nation and not the states is the guarantee of our free- 
dom and welfare; to the nation we must be bound if 
either we, as individuals, or the nation itself, are to en- 
dure and prosper. This condition is a mandate to 
education, calling upon it to build the foundation of 
unity in the minds and hearts of the rising generation. 
The spirit of freedom is the first true fundamental of 
American education; the spirit of union is the second, 
and each is bound up with the other so that neither 
may hope to exist without the other. To the educator 
as to the statesman there is a supreme significance in 
Webster’s great message, “Liberty and union, one and 
inseparable, now and forever !”’ 
The problem of union today is a human problem 
and hence predominantly educational, in the broadest 
sense of the word. The history of the past quarter 
century affords two gigantic examples of the collapse 
of political unity through the absence of human unity.
-P-A-G-E-108
EDUCATING FOR UNION 83 
Russia possessed an adamantine governmental solidar- 
ity inherited from the ages, with one absolute monarch 
over all, completely bulwarked by an immense machine 
of bureaucracy ; Germany was also politically compact. 
But both were honeycombed with internal dissensions. 
The Russian autocracy long had maintained itself by 
brutal and relentless suppression of every voice and 
deed which even questioned the existing system; in 
Germany the party of revolt — the social democrats — 
formed the largest of all the organized political units. 
Both these autocracies seized upon the war as the sole 
hope of choking the party of revolt and so lengthening 
out their own existence. Both governments fell in 
complete ruin, the war having hastened the crash in- 
stead of postponing it. This is the lesson of the ages 
to every nation: that governmental solidarity is futile 
against social disunion. Still more vital is its proof 
that forcible suppression only intensifies the elements 
of dissent, when the causes of dissent are ignored and 
the appropriate remedies denied. 
Our political unity is an accomplished fact. The 
United States is the solidest government in the world 
today. The federal government reigns supreme and 
exercises powers far beyond the utmost dreams of the 
early federalist or the fears of the anti-federalists. 
The national Constitution has reached into every home 
and every place of industry or business. We have 
played a mighty part in the greatest of the wars of 
history, and never was our unity so strong and our
-P-A-G-E-109
84 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
governmental machinery so elaborate and omnipoten 
as during that war. Much of the powerful machinery 
statutory and administrative, has persisted into th 
ensuing years of peace, and some at least is sure to b 
a permanent addition to our political system. 
Time and again the frame of government has blocked 
the will of the people for years, and the people, under- 
standing that this is in full harmony with the spirit 
of the Constitution, neither resisted nor resented, but 
moved by constitutional means to reach the ends thus 
temporarily blocked. Indeed, our governmental ma- 
chinery showed itself during the war to be stronger 
than the constitution itself, by suspending, without the 
process of amendment, certain constitutional guaran- 
tees, especially those of freedom of speech, press, and 
assembly. Even now, long after the war, these guar- 
antees are still largely in suspense. It is true that this 
has been done in the main in accordance with popular 
desire, but it is no less a cogent proof of the mighty 
strength of the political machinery which has been 
built up in our national development. 
In view of these facts it would seem needless to give 
way to fear or anxiety concerning the frame of our 
government or the solidity of our institutions, for 
these were never before so mighty and so deeply en- 
trenched as they are now. Danger signs manifest 
themselves in a different direction and are seen in the 
menace of internal dissension among the body of our 
people, now grown to such immense numbers and
-P-A-G-E-110
EDUCATING FOR UNION 85 
transformed from the comparative homogeneity of 
early days into the heterogeneous mingling of human 
strains and the marked stratification of the social and 
economic system. This is the phenomenon which de- 
mands the attention of both statesman and educator, if 
the union is to be truly preserved. 
Hence, if we put down the spirit of freedom as the 
first basic element in American education, we must 
next list a spirit of union, and we must understand that 
the republic can survive and prosper only by the full 
realization of both of these elements — a combination 
difficult in the very nature of things, and perhaps never 
yet achieved in any large measure in any land or among 
any people. The ancient world often has achieved 
immense unities under autocratic rule or by means of 
the suppression of the individual. The task of democ- 
racy, and especially of our democracy, is to achieve an 
immense unity composed of free individuals — a willing 
unity of a hundred millions of people, each one of whom 
has his own ambitions and interests, his own hopes 
and plans, his own likes and dislikes, his own religion, 
his own social preferences, his own fortune to build, 
his own family and friends to favor. This has to be a 
unity of Protestant and Catholic and Jew and non- 
religionist ; a unity of the refined and the uncultured, 
of puritan New Englander and Southern cavalier and - 
Slavic immigrant; of white and black and some other 
shades; and so on ad infinitum; and, what may turn 
out to be hardest of all, of rich and poor.
-P-A-G-E-111
86 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
No wonder that serious minded men, studying the 
census of racial elements, are moved to apprehension 
and skepticism, nor that less balanced individuals insist 
that certain large elements must be excluded or, if 
already in, expelled from the Union and from the 
friendly shelter of the far-reaching Declaration of 
Independence, with its All Men. Yet, curiously 
enough, the question has been answered and the 
question mark rubbed out by the war. In 1917 and 
1918 the fires of patriotism, fed in many ways, some of 
which were noble, fused the vast mass of this hetero- 
geneous populace into a spiritual unity which literally 
worked miracles. The recalcitrant portions were so 
small and so fiercely wrought upon that they hardly 
did more than spur on the gencral movement. And 
now that we have no war to weld us, we face the prob- 
lem of devising and realizing a peace-time unity. I 
know of no greater challenge to both statesmen and 
educator than this. If it cannot be done, we have 
nothing to look forward to but national disaster late or 
soon. 
We may as well face the fact that the preservation 
of union hangs upon the principle of equality; this is 
inherent in the basic principles of our political system, 
and those principles in our political system will keep 
perpetually pushing over into the social and economic 
order; this means that everything which is a violation 
of the principle of equality, or is felt as a violation of 
that principle, threatens the soundness of the union.
-P-A-G-E-112
EDUCATING FOR UNION 87 
This is pretty near the heart of our national problem : 
liberty is the aim and end of the state itself and of our 
aspirations and endeavors, and liberty is bound up 
indissolubly with union; but union is more and more 
manifestly bound up with equality. The recent devel- 
opment of our economic life at least has powerful trends 
toward inequality : the poor may not be getting poorer, 
but the rich are getting enormously richer, and their 
riches are taking on momentous political power. If 
any one doubts that wealth and poverty cause immense 
inequality, even before the most just and equitable 
court of law, let him read the mass of facts in the Car- 
negie Foundation’s publication entitled “Justice and 
the Poor.” That wealth exercises great if not pre- 
dominant control in the actual practice of politics is 
evident to the most modest apprehension : our political 
history is pock-marked with disgraceful episodes of 
corruption by the use of money, until the national mind 
has become calloused to a dangerous degree. Consider 
the shame of 1920, when the president of a great uni- 
versity, who had been a candidate for the presidential 
nomination, publicly charged that one of his competi- 
tors, an army officer of general rank, had been supported 
by an enormous ‘‘slush-fund” in the convention; or 
the trial of a United States senator for “buying his 
seat” in the Senate; or the ramifying tentacles of the 
more recent “oil scandal.” 
The trend in the economic order no less threatens 
the fact and the sense of equality: the man whom the
-P-A-G-E-113
88 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
Constitution declares to be a free and sovereign citizen 
finds himself a mere cog in the economic machine, with 
his daily bread and the lives of his wife and family 
absolutely dependent upon the volition of another man 
or upon the gigantic currents of industry and commerce. 
It is futile to talk of turning back the tide of economic 
evolution; but it is imbecile to ignore the profound 
bearing of that tide upon the dearest hopes of our 
democracy — liberty, equality, and their only solid 
basis, union. It is absurd to deny the inexorable facts 
of physical and spiritual differences in human beings, 
even when they are all citizens of the same republic, 
and no sensible man wants to abolish the diversities 
of function and condition which are bound up with 
these natural diversities; but it is fatal to surrender to 
the political and social evils which spring out of these 
inequalities, and nothing less than treason to the Re- 
public to exploit them for selfish advantage in ways 
that tend to the extinction of every vestige of the ideals 
which underlie the Constitution and the Declaration of 
Independence. 
What can education do to generate in the young a 
spirit which shall make for this true human unity in the 
whole body of our people? First, the educator must 
emphatically--diselaim sole responsibility, or even chief 
responsibility. Far more potent are other forces over 
which he has little or no control —~ industry, commerce, 
economic status, especially the sweeping distinctions 
of wealth and poverty, the general social life of the
-P-A-G-E-114
EDUCATING FOR UNION 89 
people, and religious differences. These are the giant 
forces which make or unmake national unity far beyond 
the power of the schools to counteract. Yet even here 
the educator has one means at hand, that is to foster 
in the minds of the youth a clear conception of the vital 
and crucial nature of the problem of unity, and a habit 
of thinking honestly and unselfishly on this as on other 
national questions. But it is safe to say that all he 
can do will be of no avail unless those controlling the 
actual streams of national life awake to the crisis and 
throw the weight of their influence into the scale on the 
side of national unity. 
It is terrible to behold how selfish interests and all 
sorts of perfectly natural forces of dissension ceaselessly 
operate to make the world of action a force for split- 
ting the nation into hostile or at least mutually suspi- 
cious cliques and factions. Will our men of affairs 
turn a little of their keen logic and powerful will- 
power from their private ends to this great call of 
patriotism ? 
For the school — meaning the public school system 
as a whole—I am moved to say that it has, in the 
main, closely approached perfection in at least one part 
of this task — it has actually embraced all the chil- 
dren of all of the people in an impartial and enthusi- 
astic hospitality. I know of no place more free from 
prejudice. Both teachers and pupils simply ignore the 
shades of color, physical and spiritual, which so embroil 
the adult world. I suspect that this is one service of
-P-A-G-E-115
90 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
the schools that might well be worth all the system 
costs. 
When we come to consider possible instruction in the 
spirit of union we find admirable and forceful matter 
in the most authoritative national documents, of which 
far more use might be made in the school, especially 
in the. more advanced stages. The preamble of the 
Constitution, the opening phrase of which we have 
already quoted, is itself an expression of the wide scope 
of the national ideal. Almost every word in it is 
pregnant with meaning, and the paragraph as a whole 
deserves the most reverential and assiduous attention. 
It is the people who ordained and established the Con- 
stitution, and it is ordained for all the people. Union 
is the first objective, followed by justice, tranquillity, 
defense, welfare, and liberty. True, the bulk of the 
Constitution itself consists of rather technical specifica- 
tions for governmental machinery; yet even here the 
discerning eye notes the absolute absence of class dis- 
tinctions, of special privilege or limitations, the unvary- 
ing equity of all its provisions, the jealous safeguarding 
of the rights of people as such. The great Fourteenth 
Amendment extends all the benefits of the Constitution 
to every citizen and draws into the fold of citizenship 
“all persons born or naturalized in the United States, 
and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” 
The young citizen easily learns to be proud of his own 
citizenship ; may he not also, by wise instruction, learn 
what is not so easy but logically valid, to respect citizen-
-P-A-G-E-116
EDUCATING FOR UNION 91 
ship in his fellows and resist the temptation to belittle 
or despise or hate them, even though their opinions, 
their manners, their religion, their habits of life, may be 
different from his? Will not the study of these phases 
of our Constitution tend to mitigate those evils of 
partisanship and dissension so eloquently portrayed by 
Washington himself, which, he says, “serve to distract 
the public councils, and enfeeble the community with 
ill-founded jealousies and false alarms; kindle the 
animosity of one part against another, foment riot and 
occasionally insurrection.” 
The Union was first thwarted and hampered by the 
jealousies of state against state. That was the diffi- 
culty at the very beginning. Especially did the small 
states suspect and fear the large ones. All that has 
vanished like thin air. Later the Union was put in 
mortal hazard by a clash between North and South. 
That, too, has passed almost as completely and need be 
feared no more. The new peril is not of geographical 
disunion but of a horizontal cleavage, a splitting: of 
the body politic into classes, all inhabiting the same 
states, the same cities, often the same precincts, yet 
looking upon each other with deep suspicion and dis- 
trust. Noman can look out upon the facts of the social 
and economic life of the country today without seeing 
the signs everywhere of this great threat. Such dis- 
union would be more terrible and fatal than any pre- 
vious form ; it would embroil every community against 
itself and fill the land with strife in every corner; the
-P-A-G-E-117
92 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
line of battle would be co-extensive with the inhabited 
territory of the nation. 
The working details of solution for this problem must 
be devised by economic and political experts. But the 
spirit which will make any solution possible is the spirit 
of unity. The school must do all it can to breed a 
type of citizen who naturally will tend to respect his 
fellow citizen, to feel keenly the universal bond which 
embraces us all as members of the republic, to realize 
that no man can prosper alone and that when any one 
of the 100,000,000 of Americans suffers, it is matter of 
consequence for his fellow citizens. But all the school 
can do, both by its own spirit of unity and by its incul- 
cation of the principles of the Union, will be of little 
avail unless the mighty forces of the world of action can 
be turned so as to bind together instead of splitting 
apart, as is too often the case now. The great body of 
citizens must cease to harp upon the things that sepa- 
rate us from each other, and stress ever more the 
greater and nobler aims and concepts that bind men 
together. “The Union must be preserved,” said 
Lincoln in his own days of crisis, “and all indispensable 
means must be used.”” 
This, too, is a fundamental of American education.

CHAPTER VI 
EDUCATING FOR PATRIOTISM 
No more significant words were spoken in the course 
of the World War than those of the martyr, Edith 
Cavell, as she stood on the verge of execution: “Now 
I see that patriotism is not enough.” All her actions 
taken in themselves were such as to win the praise and 
love of any human heart: she had been an angel of 
mercy to friend and foe alike. Yet in the clash of 
hostile nationalisms she was adjudged a spy and sen- 
tenced to the extreme penalty. She is perhaps the 
most moving and tragic single figure of the vast drama 
of the War: it is strange that so little has been made of 
her farewell words. 
Against patriotism itself she brought no accusation : 
we cannot suppose that she intended any repudiation 
of the loyalty to her own beloved native land which she 
had so convincingly proved. But she had seen German 
soldiers as well as British, maimed or dying, and had 
perceived the exceeding human likeness between them ; 
she knew — what in those days so few could bring 
themselves to think of — that friend and foe were 
both equally imbued with the simple human love of 
the land of their nativity or their adoption, and that 
95
-P-A-G-E-121
96 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
neither one doubted that he was giving his life in a 
sacred cause. She saw the tragic failure of such 
emotions, noble as they are, in and by themselves to 
bless human life or save the world. 
To most of us the word patriotism is fraught with the 
very odor of sanctity: it takes its place among our 
“holy names,” along with mother and father and home ; 
it is the theme of our national songs, the crowning 
virtue of our national heroes. We grow up mainly in 
peace and tranquillity and hear love of country ex- 
tolled as the bulwark of national security and welfare. 
Our training from infancy up, in home and school, in 
church and social intercourse, and especially in the 
whole potent culture exercised by our political life, 
all tend to the contrary of Edith Cavell’s words, and 
to imply that patriotism is enough. So her solemn 
words — to which we must perforce give heed, being 
spoken by her and in the shadow of a martyr’s death 
on our side of the conflict — may well puzzle and per- 
haps disturb our minds. 
Still more depressing and perturbing are many facts. 
Wars have been waged mostly with the hostile forces 
both crying to heaven that they were fighting only 
from patriotic devotion, and only to vindicate the 
sacred honor or to preserve the very existence of their 
respective countries. Mostly both contestants have 
prayed to the same God in name at least and each has 
identified its cause with the purposes of divine provi- 
dence,
-P-A-G-E-122
EDUCATING FOR PATRIOTISM 97 
It is terrible to reflect that the universal slogan of all 
the nations in the World War was ever patriotism, and 
that for four years men murdered each other in the 
interest of their national ambitions. Nor is there the 
slightest ground for questioning the sincerity of the 
common soldiers or the common people in any of the 
multitude of nations involved: it was at least the name 
of patriotism that spurred them on — whatever may 
have been the unlimited variety of ideas bchind the 
word. Each people was fired for the conflict by appeals 
to love of country and went into battle convinced that 
they were fighting in defense of national ideals. 
Nicolai, in the “Biology of War,” taking his figure 
from the familiar legend of the Pied Piper, puts the 
case with gruesome irony: “Never before have four 
hundred million rats followed the lure of the shrill pipe 
of the rat-catcher.” And an American poet, William 
Ellery Leonard, has expanded Nicolai’s pithy sentence 
into an equally gruesome poem: 
The huge Pied Piper, in a giant dance, 
Began his piping on the fields of France. 
* * * * * * * 
He piped and he jigged of fear and hate, 
Of love of country and glory of state ; 
And he piped of God and he piped of Man — 
This giant Jester, this Charlatan. 
* * * * * * * 
And four crazed years, under winds and the moon, 
The Millions followed in a jigging rigadoon.!

The present state of Europe, five years after the 
Armistice, is flagrant proof of the truth of Edith 
Cavell’s words. Has history ever known such tragic 
irony as the name we so often gave the late conflict — 
“a War to end wars”? Thus far it seems to have 
rather universalized and perpetuated war. The prob- 
lem of maintaining any peace was never so formidable 
and baffling; and the menace of war, if it comes, never 
one tenth so awful. Well might Osler say that we must 
either have a totally different civilization, or no civiliza- 
tion at all. 
But what has all this to do with education, and why 
should an educator presume to meddle with questions 
so deep and tragic? To put it very briefly, it has 
everything to do with education, and we believe that 
education has much to do with it. The educator even 
as citizen would be blind or worse if he could ignore 
these most fateful of facts and problems for his country 
and humanity. For our country is engaged in doubtful 
contest, both with its own internal problems and with 
its relations with the Great Society of the world. No 
divinity has guaranteed our future: we shall have to 
achieve a truer patriotism than we now possess — or 
than any race ever has possessed — and must add to 
that the something beyond patriotism which Edith 
Cavell’s dying message urges us to seek. 
If any one of the nations involved in the World War 
can claim supremacy in national fervor, it must be 
Germany. There, devotion to the imperial state had
-P-A-G-E-124
EDUCATING FOR PATRIOTISM 99 
become a religion: it was powerful enough to sweep 
into the ranks of battle every shade of political opinion 
—even the great party of freedom, the Social-Demo- 
crats, who before the outbreak of hostilities had been 
the bitter enemies of both war and the imperial state 
itself: under the spell of nationalistic passion they 
denied the very essence of their creed; they even 
expelled from their membership the valiant few who 
stood resolutely by the faith, and joined in persecuting 
them. 
This German patriotism was the product of more 
than a hundred years of the most assiduous education. 
It had been sown and cultivated in home and school 
and church, and enfibered by universal military service. 
It was taught by university professors and preached 
from pulpits; it was dramatized by maneuvers and 
military spectacles. Nothing was left undone which 
might thoroughly infect every German child with the 
standard type of sentiment toward his country and her 
“place in the sun.” Throughout the whole range of 
the stratified castes of German society, from Junker 
in castle down to laborer’s family crowded into one 
miserable room, this “patriotism,” such as it was, 
reigned. After making due allowance for the immense 
forces of history and geography, and especially of the 
first Napoleon, in providing a natural seed-bed for such 
a growth, still education can claim a notable part in 
the “ triumph.” 
Yet the first stages of this very patriotism were noble
-P-A-G-E-125
100 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
and human. It was born out of outrageous oppression 
by the Corsican adventurer, and its first nourishment 
was a lofty conception of freedom and national destiny. 
Its earliest prophet was the philosopher Fichte, who 
staked his life unhesitatingly in his country’s service 
in times of desperate odds and finally died a victim of 
the wars. His great historic ‘‘ Addresses to the German 
People,” delivered in Berlin while Napoleon’s troops 
were still parading through the streets, were a trumpet 
call to freedom and new national life. It is true that he 
preached in the most extreme terms the incomparable 
virtues of the German race and told them they were the 
“Chosen of God”; but he called them to service in the 
interest of all humanity. For more than a generation 
such was the spirit of German patriotism. 
Then came the autocratic crime of the suppression 
of liberty throughout Europe, culminating in the great 
but unsuccessful revolutionary year of 1848: this 
marked the recrudescence of despotism, and the suffo- 
cation of true freedom. Fast on the heels of this in 
northern Germany came the era of “Blood and Iron,” 
which unhappily was as successful as the fight for 
liberty had been unsuccessful. This was the doom of 
German patriotism: the old philosophic idealism was 
denatured: its deep and wholesome faith in the virtues 
and potency of the race degenerated into an inhuman 
nationalism, marked by inordinate pride in itself and 
profound contempt for others. It was no longer called 
to service, but only to domination. In all this, the
-P-A-G-E-126
EDUCATING FOR PATRIOTISM 101 
true debacle of Germany, education played a major réle, 
without which the disastrous transformation could 
never have arisen from Fichte and Humboldt and the 
wars of liberation to Bismarck and Ludendorf and wars 
of unbridled ambition. 
We are dwelling on this seemingly remote theme 
because of the exemplary function of history, whose 
revelatory nature Goethe has so vividly expressed in 
the words he puts into the mouth of the earth spirit : 
At the roaring loom of time I ply, 
And weave for God the garment that thou seest Him by. 
If ever the loom of time wove a lesson of instruction to 
all nations, surely it is in the World War and the long 
preludes which led up to it. It is the tragedy of all 
times that it is so easy to be wise after the event: these 
portentous preludes passed uncomprehended by man- 
kind, most of all by those most deeply concerned. The 
War afforded the first key to their solution: surely 
mankind must not lose the after-wisdom as it lacked 
the fore-knowledge! The world in 1914 had no vision 
nor insight into the sowing which was so soon to be 
harvested in terror: the long lament of history might 
well have been applied to it then: “If thou hadst 
known, even thou in this thy day, the things which 
belong to thy peace! But now are they hidden from 
thee!”’ Nearly ten years have passed: those then in 
the prime of life and holding the helms of national policy 
have grown old and are yielding the control to a new 
generation. The supreme task of education is to
-P-A-G-E-127
102 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
waken and enlighten the minds of these new captains 
and pilots and guide their hearts into the service of the 
ever-renewed truth which alone can make nations and 
men free. 
Nor need we cross the ocean to find examples: what 
of our own great Civil War? Who can question the 
sincerity and nobility of the patriotism of Robert E. 
Lee and Stonewall Jackson, and of the overwhelming 
majority of the men in gray and their devoted sup- 
porters in a million Southern homes? There, too, 
selfishness and private ambition, pride of race and of 
state, contempt for those who opposed them, mingled 
with the pure stream of love of native land and precip- 
itated the catastrophe. The reunited country today 
is still menaced by the unsolved enigmas springing 
out of the institution which split the nation into frat- 
ricidal strife. What loss and miseries and what pil- 
ing up of future evils might not have been spared if 
both North and South had had a patriotism not less 
passionate but more wise and humane? 
One other dark neutral background must be added to 
the sketch before the positive foreground is drawn in. 
That is the blindness and selfishness of men toward the 
truest interests of their own land. This is inextricably 
mingled with the international animosity which we have 
thus far contemplated. This is, if possible, a harder 
riddle than the other: and also probably more funda-~ 
mental and vital, for it is not limited to the periods of 
international conflict and actual war, but spreads like
-P-A-G-E-128
EDUCATING FOR PATRIOTISM * 103 
a blanket over the whole existence of the nation. But 
for the despotic ambition of the ’forties, freedom might 
have triumphed in Europe long ago, and the present 
chaos might never have been. But for the greed of 
German industrialism and the arrogant pride of the 
Junkers, the latest phase of Germany’s downfall might 
have been averted. But for the economic profits of 
slavery to the South and of the slave-trade to the North, 
our own Civil War might have been spared. 
Today in our own beloved land the primary question 
is our true duty toward our country itself: we might 
even say to ourselves the words of Polonius, but in 
a better than Polonius’ meaning —~ “To thine own self 
be true,” and be assured that if we can be true to 
ourselves, with all our teeming millions of every social 
group, we shall then be true to our fellow men of other 
lands and races. 
Already there is grave cause to suspect that some of 
our most menacing conditions at home and abroad have 
their roots partly in the selfish ambitions of a small part 
of our people. It was a noble deed, a new thing in the 
history of nations, for us to desire the liberation of 
Cuba and to express that desire in action. It is doubt- 
ful in the extreme, in the light of time, whether it was 
necessary for us to crush Spain in order to insure that 
freedom. It is still more doubtful if the real welfare of 
the great mass of our people demanded that we should 
throw our forces and our flag into the far reaches of the 
Orient, even for the problematic good of the Filipinos.
-P-A-G-E-129
104 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM . 
Still more grave are certain purely domestic problems, 
preéminently those that so closely affect the daily 
lives and welfare of the mass of the people of the United 
States, the vital problems of men’s labor and reward — 
the familiar questions of work and wages, of employ- 
ment and unemployment, of capital and labor, of the 
distribution of the material goods which so profoundly 
touch the spiritual welfare of the people. Interwoven 
with these economic processes are the forms and pro- 
cesses of constitutional and legal order, almost as much 
in the foreground of public thought and activity today. 
Whether or not the true solution of these problems will 
insure against international disaster, at least it is clear 
that unless we can solve these we cannot even begin 
our international duty. : 
To some of these domestic perils we are easily 
awakened: any direct attack upon our basic institu- 
tions, or whatever can readily be made to resemble such 
an attack, arouses immediate and passionate resistance : 
whatever touches or seems to touch the sanctity of the 
Constitution or the flag will be given short shrift by 
both law and popular action, even if popular action 
has to overleap law to reach its object. So long as 
this fact stands, it is hard to see grave peril in any 
frontal attack upon our political order. So far, the 
Constitution has been more often violated in the name 
of loyalty than by any openly disloyal foe. During the 
war, indeed, the bill of rights of the national Constitu- 
tion was practically set aside, avowedly in the defense
-P-A-G-E-130
EDUCATING FOR PATRIOTISM 105 
of the national integrity and ideals. This seems to be 
inherent in the nature of war, and is one of its gravest 
perils. 
Far different is the peril of subtle flank or rear attack 
upon freedom, because it knows so well how to cloak 
itself in the very garb of patriotism itself. It is this 
type of attack which has in all ages proved able to 
destroy the liberties of strong peoples; he knows little 
of American patriotism today who supposes that any 
but a subtle and well-disguised foe can even begin the 
process of disintegration in our national life. The 
Devil will have to assume his favorite disguise as an 
Angel of Light. If only our citizenry can gain the 
insight to penetrate this disguise, we need not fear for 
their courage and energy. 
The plain-Engtish definition of patriotism is a good 
enough formula from which to develop. the--positive—- 
picture of it: itis love of country. It is not hate of any~ 
thing_or_anybedy. We cannot too often return to 
this simple English phrase, nor too often insist upon its 
positive human character. No masses of hate can take 
its place, whether against a foreign foe or against those 
of our own number whom we think of as foes. When 
men indulge in loud declarations of their love, we may 
well remember Lear’s tragic blunder: there are na- 
tional Regans and Gonerils and national Cordelias: 
the citizen must learn, if it be possible, to read aright 
both the noisy protestations of the selfish and the un- 
utterable devotion of the true lover.
-P-A-G-E-131
106 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
Education dare not presume to create the spirit of 
patriotism: that is a task beyond its powers, and hap- 
pily the generosity of nature has already provided the 
sentiment in sufficiency. Much it may do to foster 
that sentiment, and still more to enlighten it. If I am 
to love my country, I must know it, and, above all, I 
must know it as a human entity, a great body politic 
composed of men and women and children — in the 
case of our own country a vast and imposing throng of 
more than a hundred millions. 
IfT am to love the ideals of my country, I must know 
them, and I must know them as they really are. I 
must sense the part my country has played in the great 
struggle of the ages — “the struggle between the di- 
vine rights of kings and the common rights of human- 
ity.” If I am to stand in the defense of the Constitu- 
tion, I must know not only the mechanism of political 
processes, but also the spirit of liberty of which all this 
mechanism is but the instrument: the spirit is perfect 
and unamendable; the mechanism is ever an approxi- 
mation and carries as one of its most indispensable 
parts the provision for its own modification to fit it 
ever more perfectly into the demands of liberty and 
human welfare. 
Nothing else can surpass this inclusiveness of patri- 
otic love as a guarantee of the Republic. This was one 
of Lincoln’s most characteristic virtues: he was kindly 
disposed to everybody; he was extraordinarily free 
from the vice of argument by epithet ; he even objected
-P-A-G-E-132
EDUCATING FOR PATRIOTISM 107 
to the word rebel and habitually found some kinder 
term by which to designate his mistaken fellow country- 
men of the South. The true spirit of the patriot is 
breathed in the closing appeal of his first inaugural: 
“We are not enemies but friends; we must not be 
enemies.” How far different from most of us, who are 
so ready to denounce and brand those who differ from 
us and even read out of the Union all whose color or 
race or religion we do not fancy; forgetting that in so 
doing we are flouting both the immortal documents of 
our own freedom, the Declaration of Independence, 
which announces the rights of All Men, and the Con- 
stitution, which guarantees all the liberties of citizens 
to these men whom we so lightly condemn to outer 
darkness. 
Roosevelt — himself somewhat too ready with a 
caustic tongue for anybody who earned his disapproval 
— nevertheless chastises this tendency of a group or 
class to mistake themselves for the people of the United 
States, and assume that their views are the only 
sound Americanism and their policies the authentic 
patriotic program. On this vital theme, as on so many 
others connected with the practical working of genuine 
patriotism, his “Autobiography” furnishes much testi- 
mony which is peculiarly “relevant, material, and 
competent,” 
Patriotic love must stand the same test with the love 
prescribed in the Gospel: “If ye love them that love 
you, what credit is there in that? Do not even the
-P-A-G-E-133
108 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
heathen the same?” The patriotism which loves only 
its own party, its own social group or class, its own color 
or creed, is only primitive selfishness: it is of the same 
moral quality as the proverbial “honor among thieves ’’ 
and can never share in laying the foundation stones for 
democracy. 
In political affairs as in life in general, love must not 
“pule and whine.” Loving my national neighbor has 
nothing to do with surrendering my convictions of 
right to him. The most ardent love of one’s fellow 
citizens is consistent with the most energetic opposition 
to erroneous or wicked policies which they may pro- 
mote. Indeed one of the most disastrous effects of 
indulgence in personal abuse is that it clouds the issue 
and befogs the reason: the true issues are hidden in the 
dust cloud of abuse and vilification. Abraham Lincoln 
could reason with Alexander Stephens concerning 
slavery and union, with the hope that truth might be 
advanced and possibly a common ground of action 
found; but men to whom all Southerners were “slave- 
drivers” and men to whom all Northerners were 
“black Republicans” found no means of debate except 
deadly weapons, and bloodshed was the inevitable con- 
sequence. 
How large a proportion of our hundred million people 
or of our sixty million adults can rise to the moral 
height of differing with their fellow citizens and yet not 
hating them, of opposing their policies to the hilt and 
still sincerely and passionately desiring the freedom and
-P-A-G-E-134
EDUCATING FOR PATRIOTISM 109 
prosperity of their opponents for the simple reason that 
these opponents are human beings and American citi- 
zens under the Constitution? Upon this, it may well 
turn out, rests the salvation of the Republic and of 
human freedom everywhere. This, and this only, is 
patriotic love, and this is religion and virtue and hu- 
manity. But, alas, how steep and arduous a moral and 
political climb! And how easy to take refuge in a 
counterfeit patriotism which compounds for a virtue it 
finds too stern, by the easy method of personal vitupera- 
tion. Somewhere there is a story of a lawyer’s practice 
notes which contained the item: “If you have no case, 
saw the air and denounce the plaintiff’s attorney.” 
Today our patriotism is being tried on this very 
count. Argument by epithet is still the most popular 
device in politics — and even in other fields where it 
is less justified. Too many of us have halos for 
ourselves and our party and crowns of thorns for all 
who are not just like us. The profound and complex 
questions of our national life in economics, in govern- 
ment, in social conditions, are blurred and distorted 
by the calling of bad names. Political programs are 
refuted by calling their advocates reactionaries or 
revolutionists, plutocrats or socialists, profiteers or 
proletarians, autocrats or bolshevists. One noble word 
has been almost ruined in the wordy fray — radical ; 
it is well to remember that Roosevelt calls Lincoln 
“the great radical President,” and that our Revolution- 
ary fathers were somewhat more than radical. We can-
-P-A-G-E-135
110 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
not spare the word from our vocabulary, for great 
problems are settled only by radical means; our social 
and political evils can be abolished only by striking at 
the roots. One might well define the true program of 
progress by combining two terms usually counted as 
opposites and say that the essence of all our endeavors, 
liberty, is to be achieved and preserved only by radical 
conservatism, or conservative radicalism. So far are 
these words from being an argument against any policy. 
Perhaps the greatest evil of this argument by epithet 
is its inevitable tendency to feed the flames of mutual 
hatred and suspicion: a hard name rankles; and un- 
fortunately, just because it never was logical, no later 
reasoning can be counted on to abate the irritation; it 
has to be lived down, and that is a slow and difficult 
process. Who can estimate the mental clearness and 
spiritual blessing that would come into practical 
polities and social endeavor if the bandying of hard 
names were abandoned and outlawed? Here is a task, 
not easy but quite feasible, for every sincere patriot. 
There is, after all, one sense in which patriotism may 
involve hate: that is the hate of whatever deforms or 
damages the life of the people. He may well hate crime 
and lawlessness ; no less should he hate injustice, even 
when it takes the form of law: he must hate these 
things without regard to persons, and may not make 
exceptions in favor of himself or his friends. He should 
hate poverty and dependency and unemployment, ex- 
cessive hours of labor, types of occupation that injure
-P-A-G-E-136
EDUCATING FOR PATRIOTISM 111 
the body or soul of the worker, child labor, and what- 
ever else in the economic field acts to the detriment of 
American life. Most of all should he hate anything 
which robs any American citizen of his civic and politi- 
cal rights. There is such a thing as righteous indigna- 
tion; according to scripture, a man may “be angry 
and sin not”; there is plenty of room for any man’s 
natural impulse to hatred, in hating the evils which 
block the full realization of the great human ends of the 
Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. 
Thus education for patriotism is a work of purifica- 
tion and illumination: it seeks to preserve and enhance 
the warmth of love, and furnish the indispensable light 
of intelligence which alone can make that love effective. 
Such patriotism might well prove to be enough: for it 
will lead naturally and inevitably to the vision of unity, 
not only of the great host within the national limits, but 
also of the greater host, likewise human and potentially 
free, in the Great Society of Humanity. 
It is clear that there is no short and easy road to 
education for patriotism. The field of action in the 
modern era is extended and complex: national prob- 
lems are harder than ever before, and to them are now 
added the inevitable international responsibilities and ~ 
opportunities which have arisen through the new unity 
of the whole earth. Knowledge has multiplied without 
bounds, until no man can know more than an infini- 
tesimal fraction of it; and even the knowledge which 
seems to belong to the irreducible minimum for civic
-P-A-G-E-137
112 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
intelligence is so varied and extended that it 
tion by the general run of men seems to e: 
bounds of possibility. All these things share 
mining the aim and procedure of education for the age. 
Patriotic education for democracy must work from 
the sky down to the grass roots: from the loftiest ideals 
of patriotic sentiment down to the minimal details of 
civic duty and social function. Nothing must be too 
great to be undertaken and nothing too small to be con- 
sidered, if only it bears upon the function of citizenship. 
First the main directions must be settled beyond reason- 
able doubt —- we must orient our patriotism; unless 
the governing principles of our national life are true, no 
perfection of detail nor efficiency of performance will 
avail. Yet political faith also is known only in its 
works: and all principles work only in detail; the 
highest ideals and aspirations have to be reduced to 
actions, most of which, numerically at least, are in 
themselves small and often apparently petty. To 
such an impressive, manifold, and varied undertaking 
is democratic education addressing itself.

CHAPTER VII 
EDUCATING FOR CIVIC DUTY 
Can we mobilize our fifty-five million voters for 
action? In the presidential election of 1916, in spite 
of the momentous character of the issues at stake, and 
the intense interest in the campaign, less than half of 
the possible legal electors even cast their ballots; the 
chief executive was chosen by less than thirty per cent 
of the electors. It will be recalled that the final result 
hung on the vote of one state which was in doubt, Cali- 
fornia, and the decision there was made by a plurality of 
less than one per cent. A trifling fraction of the non- 
voting electors in California could have thrown the 
state into the other column and changed the result of 
the national election. 
Yet, in fact, fifty per cent is an unusually high propor- 
tion of active voters at any form of election. Com- 
paratively few of our public officials receive as much as 
thirty per cent of the possible votes of their constitu- 
ency, and many are elected by less than ten per cent. 
The plain truth is that the great majority of our citizens 
are “absent without leave” most of the time: they do 
not perform even the irreducible minimum of civic duty 
by going to the polls and contributing their share of 
115
-P-A-G-E-141
116 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
elemental sovereignty to the Republic. Very few of 
the absentees have excuses which can stand the test of 
democracy. After deducting those who are prevented 
by illness, genuine emergencies in their affairs, and other 
legitimate causes, there still remains an immense mass 
of pure delinquency. But justice demands the im- 
mediate admission that the real responsibility for most 
of this delinquency is not individual but social: it is 
not due to a lack of personal virtue but to certain weak- 
nesses in our national education and certain great in- 
herent difficulties in the operation of immense political 
organizations. 
Nor can we console ourselves with the idea that after 
all the best intelligence of the country is represented in 
those who do vote, and that the non-voters are the ig- 
norant and incompetent. It is notorious that precincts 
in which education and culture predominate make no 
better showing than those peopled mainly by the ig- 
norant and unschooled. Indeed the political indiffer- 
ence of the privileged classes is one of our gravest 
symptoms: and certainly their delinquency is far more 
culpable than that of the unprivileged masses. 
The actual casting of a vote is of course but the out- 
ward act of civic duty, indispensable but not in itself 
sufficient unless it is backed by the necessary study and 
consideration in advance of the measures or candidates 
to be passed upon. No statistics can measure the 
degree to which the people discharge this more vital 
part of their duty ; but one cannot avoid the conviction
-P-A-G-E-142
et —_—_, EDUCATING FOR CIVIC DUTY 7 
that there is as much delinquency here as in the voting 
itself. I suspect the majority of even those who make 
it a point of civic conscience to go to the polls would 
have to confess that seldom do they take with them 
clear and reasoned convictions on all the questions pre- 
sented on the ballot. Individual instances could be 
cited in abundance supporting this view: I well recall 
one such in a vitally important city election: a new 
council was to be chosen, of nine members, and this 
was the primary in which twice that number were to 
be chosen from some eighty who had filed — and the 
eighty represented a striking variety of fitness, from the 
highest competency to utter worthlessness; yet on 
the morning of election a highly educated young lawyer 
had to appeal to one of the women of his family for her list 
of candidates, having totally neglected to form his own 
judgment; fortunately the lady appealed to belonged 
to an organization which had made a careful study of 
the whole primary ticket and framed a list of the most 
worthy candidates. 
It would be 2 total fallacy to think of these facts as 
evidence of any sort of degeneration or deterioration in 
our political life. They simply point to one of our un- 
solved problems, and one which has never been solved 
at any previous time or place in history. We are not 
worse than our fathers: we must only hope and labor, 
that our children may be better than we are. The 
task of American democracy marks a new phase in 
political experience: it is vaster and more complex
-P-A-G-E-143
118 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
than any previous project of the sort. For all th 
political remissness and neglect which we have tried t 
suggest above, there are good reasons in the nature o 
things. We have an entirely unprecedented multitud 
of citizens and a still more unprecedented minglin, 
of heterogeneous elements in the body politic. Th 
questions and issues presented to the voters are infi- 
nitely manifold and complex, hard to grasp and still 
harder to decide intelligently, so that the individual 
voter may well be forgiven if he loses courage and de- 
spairs of summoning up wisdom enough for the job. 
In national elections especially he is likely to be dulled 
by a sense of the remoteness of the actual conduct of 
affairs and the impotence of his single vote. In spite 
of our dreams and aspirations we still have a large con- 
tingent of the submerged within the body of our citi- 
zens: certainly some millions of enfranchised voters 
are completely absorbed in the mere struggle for exist- 
ence; the day’s labor exhausts their energies, and the 
fear of ever-impending unemployment, with its train 
of destitution and misery, shuts out any but the most 
superficial knowledge of public affairs and tends also to 
bias hopelessly any conclusions reached. 
Among the more fortunate groups their very fortune 
too often runs to an almost like result: they are en- 
grossed by “the deceitfulness of riches,” and they, too, 
have no time for civic function in the true sense, and 
their conclusions, likewise, are prone to be hopelessly 
biased by their personal desires and interests. It is
-P-A-G-E-144
EDUCATING FOR CIVIC DUTY 119 
a painful fact that the example of Theodore Roosevelt 
is so nearly isolated in our national experience. How 
many hundred young men whose circumstances were 
substantially the same, who like him inherited a com- 
petence and were favored with the fullest opportunity 
for higher education, nevertheless unlike him escaped 
any sense of civic responsibility and spent their lives 
either in selfish and fruitless ease or, according to the 
more approved American style, in swelling to still 
larger proportions the mass of their inherited wealth? 
In this matter the United States compares but poorly 
with countries with far less boast of democracy and 
universal citizenship. 
For this latter group a different education and 
changed public opinion is the apparent immediate 
remedy: in particular, the responsibility must be 
charged home to institutions of higher learning in 
which, to so large an extent, the youth of these privi- 
leged groups are to be found. For the submerged 
groups, education will be of little avail until the doors 
are opened by better economic conditions. There are 
few more unanswerable arguments for the eight-hour 
day in industry, and for something better than a “liv- 
ing wage,” than the absolute vested interest of the body 
politic in its laboring members. 
How much shall the citizen delegate his political 
thinking to others? It is manifest that most of us 
have neither the time nor the basic technical. knowl- 
edge to enable us to analyze fully and decide intelli-
-P-A-G-E-145
120 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
gently many of the problems upon which we must 
vote. So the necessity of delegating some of our think- 
ing easily leads to delegating too much of it. Educa- 
tion can only aim at increasing the political wisdom 
of the young citizen and fostering in him an intellectual 
independence which will impel him to take into his 
own control more and more of the decisions which he 
must make as a voter and as one of the formers of 
general public opinion. 
In a certain sense the fact of present remissness is 
ground for hope rather than despair: if we have man- 
aged to survive politically with less than fifty per cent 
civic function, what may not be hoped from even a 
modest increase? Over against the discouraging statis- 
tics and impressions we may put the encouraging fact 
that there exists even now a very considerable minority 
of earnest and competent citizens who not only vote 
but also devote time and energy to the study of political 
issues and to the enlightenment of their fellow citizens. 
The basic need here, as in so many other aspects of the 
common life, is education of a sort to meet the demand : 
and there are signs in plenty that such education is 
being developed in many ways and by many agencies, 
in and out of schools. Let us consider some of the 
possible elements in this educational task. 
First of all we need a sound public sentiment toward 
politics. So long as it is respectable and even a sort of 
distinction for an American to sneer at politics and 
boast of his indifference and inaction, we need not hope
-P-A-G-E-146
EDUCATING FOR CIVIC DUTY 121 
for any full and general sense of political obligation in 
the rising generation. Why cannot public opinion con- 
demn slackers as relentlessly and as effectively in peace 
asin war? May we not reasonably hope for a time 
when any American will be overcome with shame if he 
has to admit that he has not studied the questions to be 
voted upon, and still more if he has to confess that he 
actually absented himself from the polls on election 
day?’ Already things are distinctly better in this re- 
spect than they were twenty years ago. Let all join in 
fostering this spirit of civic obligation and in kindling a 
powerful and effective public sentiment to back it. 
The entrance of women into the political field has 
proved an immense gain in this matter: the women 
have taken their political duty with a new seriousness, 
and in the main with an exemplary sincerity and devo- 
tion to the common good. It is impossible to doubt 
that their example will greatly contribute to the general 
awakening and stimulation of the other sex, who have 
grown careless of the privileges which they have so 
long possessed. 
Closely related to the question of a right public 
opinion on ordinary civic duty is the imperative neces- 
sity of a new attitude toward holding public office. It 
may be a mere pious wish to think of the office seeking 
the man instead of the man seeking the office: yet even 
that might come to pass if it were not so common for 
the ablest men to reject every invitation to undertake 
public office when it involves a sacrifice of private gain
-P-A-G-E-147
122 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
or comfort. It is useless to dream of raising the finan- 
cial rewards of political positions to the present stand- 
ards of business and professions unless some profound 
and now unforeseen transformation should take place 
in our economic system. Yet it is intolerable that 
public service should periodically be subjected to the 
humiliation of having officials resign even from the 
highest offices simply to increase their emolument : 
this has become rather common with cabinet officers in 
recent years. Indeed, in a recent presidential year, one 
of the much-proposed candidates baldly announced 
that he could not afford financially to be president but 
must make money for his family! Even supposing 
that this was not entirely disingenuous, the really 
damaging fact is that the people as a whole took the 
statement as a matter of course: neither the man him- 
self nor the people to whom his statement was made 
sensed the fact that it was really a profound disrespect 
to the chief magistracy of the nation. If our children 
are to grow up with a powerful and controlling sense of 
civic obligation, public opinion will have to cease toler- 
ating the idea that any man’s private business or pleas- 
ure is paramount to the interests of the nation or any 
of its political units. This may be a long road for our 
“‘business-minded”’ public to travel, but it is indispen- 
sable to full success in our education for political duty. 
Nothing can compete educationally against the force 
of public opinion. 
Thus far we have dealt with the problem of getting
-P-A-G-E-148
EDUCATING FOR CIVIC DUTY 123 
the citizen “on the job”; but what of his fitness to do 
the job? Being a citizen of the United States is a 
highly skilled occupation: it calls for practical knowl- 
edge and special capacities far beyond the present 
attainments, and far beyond what our educational sys- 
tem, in school and out, has yet even attempted. The 
insistent demand of democratic education is for political 
competency in the great mass of the people: this is the 
backbone of the principle of universal schooling, but 
the end will not be reached by just any kind of school- 
ing: we must have the right kind. This raises the prob- 
lem of political intelligence as one of the paramount 
objectives of the American public school. 
| No mere “general intelligence” will serve the turn 
—even if there were any such thing, which in the 
light of present knowledge seems exceedingly doubtful. 
Great numbers of highly intelligent members of the 
body politic are almost complete failures as citizens: 
their intelligence applies to other things and inevitably 
carries them into other fields of thought and action. 
One of the most important facts of life and education is 
that men’s minds run persistently in certain habitual 
fields — their occupations, their own personal and 
family interests, their pet avocations and hobbies: the 
effective citizen must form both the capacity and the 
habit of thinking on political questions. Such a capac- 
ity and such a habit can be formed only upon the uni- 
versal principle of definite and abundant exercise in the 
particular field.
-P-A-G-E-149
124 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
The educational problem is rendered vastly harder 
here by the hand of tradition: democracy is after all 
very new, and autocracy, in many variant forms, very 
old and deeply ingrained in the tissue of life and 
thought, in school and out. The great reform of school 
practice, which has marked educational progress since 
Rousseau, has had its eye almost exclusively upon the 
individual and has sought only to liberate and foster the 
spontaneity of the child. Our debt to this reform is 
beyond estimation, and it was an indispensable prece~ 
dent to the next step: but we must not stop short of 
the next step, which is the redirection of education to 
social ends, and, for our present purpose, to political 
ends. Freedom rises in the individual mind and spirit, 
but does not end there: it must live and move and have 
its being in the social order; and its supreme function 
is to create and maintain that order. How to do this 
is the problem of political and social intelligence. 
It is inevitably true, as a result of history, that the 
traditional school curriculum has run too much in ir- 
relevant matters and must now vigorously pull itself 
toward topics and problems of the sort which appear on 
ballots and demand the attention of lawmakers and ex- 
ecutives and should therefore be passed upon directly 
or indirectly by all citizens. As things are, even the 
majority of college graduates go out grossly ignorant 
of the very rudiments of actual, practical government 
and civie activity. They have actually been trained 
clear away from these fields of thought so that they
-P-A-G-E-150
EDUCATING FOR CIVIC DUTY 125 
can live for years without being moved to give any 
effective attention to them — unless indeed they are 
shocked into attention by conditions which threaten 
their own personal peace or profit. 
How totally inadequate and almost ridiculous is the 
school instruction, for example, on the traditional topic 
of civics — “How a bill becomes a law.’”’ Practical 
civic skill and ability begins where the school instruc- 
tion leaves off, for the constitutional provisions are 
pure form and mechanism, while the real influences 
determining whether a bill shall become a law or not 
are dynamic and human. It would be well for every 
high school student at least to understand something of 
the maze of public and personal forces which operate on 
every legislative proposal that touches the common 
welfare, and something about such intensely practical 
matters as trading, filibustering, smothering in com- 
mittee, parliamentary sharp practice, and many such 
things; and no less something about the great con- 
structive labors of individuals and organizations in 
the interest. of better legislation on all sorts of public 
questions. 
This practical political instruction would beware of 
disproportionate stress upon the seamy side and would 
do full justice to the great body of sincere and genuine 
work in the field of politics. We are fortunate in 
having great resources for this side of the lesson in our 
history and especially in the lives and political careers 
of some of our leaders. Roosevelt’s “Autobiography”
-P-A-G-E-151
126 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
is almost a textbook of the whole field of practical 
politics, in which good and evil are vividly set forth in 
a way to foster a healthy critical attitude without any 
tendency toward political cynicism. 
The school is already moving rapidly to a better dis- 
charge of its special duty in the task of training for 
practical civic capacity and the habit of civic activity 
in its pupils. In the field of instruction the growth of 
the social studies is the most vital movement: twenty- 
five years ago the great forward pressure was in the 
field of the natural sciences; today it is in the field of 
the human sciences — history, civics, economics. The 
central point in this movement is in the newly invented 
subject of community civics, in which the pupil is busied 
with the study of his immediate civic surroundings — 
his school district, his city, his county. One is struck 
with the eager interest of boys and girls in high school 
and even in the elementary grades in these political 
problems which lie so close to their daily lives and 
which are carried on by their own relatives or acquaint- 
ances. One may find a class studying the fire ordi- 
nances and the civic function of the fire department — 
with one of the boys actually informing the teacher as 
well as his fellow pupils on things he has learned down 
at the engine-house ; or a high school group visiting the 
courthouse or city hall to see government in action. 
This first-hand intimate study of community affairs 
leads naturally to the wider problems of state and 
national politics; the basic principles of representative
-P-A-G-E-152
EDUCATING FOR CIVIC DUTY 127 
government, of legislation and administration, of right 
and justice, are all involved in the community; they 
carry over into the broader field and throw vivid light 
upon what otherwise would be mere abstraction and 
obscurity. 
It is true that there are some serious obstacles to this 
new and more vital political instruction, which arise 
not in the school but in the attitude of the public or of 
certain types and elements in the public. Not a few 
persons are inclined to look with suspicion upon the 
whole field of social studies; colleges and universities 
are frequently charged with propaganda for some dan- 
gerous doctrine, when in fact they are simply perform~ 
ing their duty by assisting the students to understand ~ 
the various shades of political opinion and practice 
which actually make up the world of national and 
local affairs. There are always some in a community 
who confuse sociology with socialism and mistake an 
exposition of facts concerning syndicalism with ad- 
vocacy of the program of the I. W. W. Propaganda in 
favor of either side of a question that divides the body 
politic cannot in the nature of things be required or 
even permitted in the universal public school. Happily 
the main business of education for American citizenship 
is not teaching the young what they shall think on any 
question, but rather teaching them how to think and 
fostering the habit and capacity of thinking on all ques- 
tions that may concern them and of forming their own 
rational conclusions and acting accordingly.
-P-A-G-E-153
128 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
Put in the briefest possible form, the aim of education 
for political intelligence is to get children to think, and 
to think about things that matter: the latter point is the 
crux of the whole situation, within and without the 
school, during education and in the active practice of 
citizenship. The great and indispensable means to this 
end is quite clear, and entirely feasible: it is free 
access to facts, and to all the facts that matter. This is 
easy to say, and rather hard for any one to deny di- 
rectly, but it is a perplexing and arduous task in prac- 
tice, and might easily be the rock upon which freedom 
should strike. Let us first clear away two, possible 
misunderstandings : 
First, this does not mean unlimited liberty in the 
expression of opinions: democratic education seeks not 
to inoculate the pupil with any opinions, but to foster 
his capacity to form wise judgments himself. The free- 
souled teacher would scorn to take advantage of his 
pupil’s relative immaturity to impose opinions upon 
him. 
In the next place, this is not a defense of any mere 
muckraking of crimes and misdemeanors, either indi- 
vidual or social: telling the truth, even “the whole 
truth,” does not require the retailing of every unsavory 
incident or repugnant detail, simply to be sure that 
nothing is left out and that the child shall not think too 
well of his country or her heroes: let these be told when 
they are vital to the truth of the whole concept, and 
even then not with malicious glee, but rather in ac-
-P-A-G-E-154
EDUCATING FOR CIVIC DUTY 129 
cordance with the injunction to speak the truth in 
love. 
But, after making these two provisos, we must add 
at once, first, that no fact should ever be denied or 
distorted, nor should the learner ever be blocked in his 
search for truth by refusing him access to facts ; and, 
second, that attempts to suppress the “teaching of 
erroneous opinions’’ are far more likely to work harm 
than good. In other words, even in these regions, any 
reasonable doubt must always be resolved in favor of 
freedom of both teacher and learner. 
No less valuable for political training is the order and 
morale of the school. Here the forward movement is 
quite as marked as in the studies: the schools are being 
transformed from the traditional type of autocracy to 
a new democratic form. Formally in student govern- 
ment and informally in the general life and discipline 
of the school the pupil’s intelligence and will are called 
into action on behalf of the common good. Student 
participation in the definite functions of government is 
no longer an experiment but has been fully demon- 
strated in high schools and higher institutions and, in 
properly modified form, even in elementary grades. 
The basic processes of representative government are 
all embodied in this school activity — elections, holding 
office, responsibility to constituency, the elementary 
principles of legislation and of law enforcement. 
These new vital phases of instruction and of school 
order were virtually unknown when the present genera-
-P-A-G-E-155
130 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
tion of adult citizens were in school ; now a school which 
ignores or neglects them marks itself as quite out of 
date, and we may count on their rapid extension 
through the whole system. Is it not reasonable to 
look for marked improvement in civic intelligence and 
spirit in the rising generation springing from these 
marked advances in civic education? 
But we still face a formidable and menacing gap in 
our scheme of political training in the great mass of the 
pupils who drop out of school before they ean receive 
any effective civie enlightenment or inspiration. The 
high point of civic training does not arrive before the 
period of adolescence, and probably comes late in that 
period. In terms of school training, we may put this 
high point late in high school or early in college: some 
would probably put it even later. The terrible fact 
is that more than half of all our prospective citizens 
leave school without anything that can be counted as 
even the beginning of genuine training for the practical 
duties of citizenship. 
It is true that these conditions are probably on the 
mend, and that the average schooling of children is 
increasing; but this process is slow and cannot be 
counted upon to give any considerable relief. The 
only answer is after-school education. The United 
States is rather backward in this field of education and, 
moreover, what after-school training we have lays little 
stress upon civic education. One can only raise a ery 
for public attention to this great need. It is a curious
-P-A-G-E-156
EDUCATING FOR CIVIC DUTY 131 
paradox that we are doing far more for the immigrant 
who is seeking citizenship than for the native-born who 
has left school: yet the young native-born American 
who left school before the end of the elementary period 
is likely to be as much in need of political education as 
the adult immigrant, and surely quite as much entitled 
to it. 
The really logical procedure in this matter would be 
to provide instruction for the whole body of young per- 
sons who are about to assume the duties and responsi- 
bilities of citizenship. If the older nations could afford 
to train every male citizen in arms for two solid years, 
at the immense cost, direct and indirect, of such a plan, 
might not a great democratic Republic provide at least a 
modicum of training in civic intelligence and loyalty, at 
the comparatively small cost which this would entail?

CHAPTER VIII 
EDUCATION FOR WORLD ORDER 
Never before has mankind suffered so vast and 
stunning a disappointment as in the years since the 
close of the World War in 1918. The long prayed-for 
downfall of Germany came, surpassing our hopes and 
imagination in its completeness and disaster: but the 
order and tranquillity which were to accompany vic- 
tory are all to seek. Of this victory we may well 
say in the bitter words of Macbeth, “‘it keeps the word 
of promise to the ear, and breaks it to the heart.” On 
our own side of the ocean we have the lasting curse of 
war profits and frauds in the form of a nation-wide 
plague of greed and arrogant wealth; and the persist- 
ence of the shackling of liberty which every war must 
in its nature entail; in Europe, wars and rumors of 
war, the latest being the spectacle of our late ally, 
France, wrecking the confidence and hazarding the 
peace of Europe by an aircraft development which is 
a threat against every European power, especially 
against England, her ally and ours in the War. 
“The gravest fact in the history of the last ten years,” 
says Norman Angell, “is not the fact of war; it is the 
135
-P-A-G-E-161
186 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
temper of mind, the blindness of conduct on the part of 
millions, which alone ultimately explains our policies.” 
Looking upon the wreckage which followed the last 
Balkan War, he had uttered the same general thought : 
“These battered and impoverished peoples will be 
preserved for no other purpose than for new wars and 
new disasters, if they do not fit themselves out with a 
new mind. And that means that the individual — 
for everything depends in the last analysis on him — 
must learn the lesson of peace and love for which, in 
Europe much more than in America, he is as yet not 
greatly receptive.” After the War, Angell was asked 
by American students before whom he had lectured, 
“What is your plan?’ What ought we todo? Should 
we make a naval alliance with Great Britain, or form a 
new League of Nations, or —?” To which he replied : 
“The first thing to do is to change your ideas and moral 
values; or to get to know them better. This is the 
most practical and immediate platform, because all 
others depend on it. — To change fundamental opinions 
and redirect desires is not apparently to ‘do’ anything 
at all. Yet until that invisible thing is done, our 
Covenants and Leagues will be as futile as have been 
numberless similar plans in the past.” 
This is just one of the many voices calling for a new 
educational program to join its indispensable force to 
the many forces working for the organization of peace 
in the world: the invisible thing which Angell points 
to is exactly the sort of thing which education seeks to 
-
-P-A-G-E-162
EDUCATION FOR WORLD ORDER 137 
foster and enhance — the inner, personal powers and 
habits of the mind and heart of the rising generation, 
the children of today, who are so soon to be the incum- 
bents of all political and social control. This, too, 
along with all other paramount issues in the welfare and 
advance of the human race, is “in the last analysis a 
question of education.” The educational element in 
the new order is not all, but it is a sine qua non for all 
the rest, and indispensable for the achievement. 
Education for world order is education for freedom 
for ourselves and for all nations. Actual war inevitably 
spells the end of freedom to the utmost limits reached 
by its influence and for the full duration of its career. 
“Armed peace,” which is the only peace now open to any 
nation, is almost as antagonistic to true freedom, free- 
dom of spirit and tranquillity of mind, as war itself. 
Both have to be displaced from the system of things if 
freedom is to reign supreme. Hence it follows that no 
discussion of education for freedom can ignore the ques- 
tion of the new world order. 
What can American education do to forward this 
great end? First, it can do what every nation should 
do in its education, undertake the great revision: the 
traditional education has always played into the hands 
of the existing order, which was always a war system ; 
the very tissue of schools has been pervaded by this: 
less, we hope and believe, in our schools than in most 
other lands, not because we are more righteous, but 
because our situation and our national experience
-P-A-G-E-163
138 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
afforded no such cause or excuse for the war spirit in 
education as did the situation and experience of France 
and Germany, for example. But ours have been dyed 
in good measure with the general color. 
This movement is already well charted in current 
educational discussion and is making some headway in 
actual school work. History is its chief field; we need 
mainly two things there: first, the reduction of war 
matter to its true perspective in the general body of 
human affairs, and a full and honest picture of it in 
place of the gilded and rose-colored deception which has 
been the style; second, the correction of nationalistic 
Pharisaism by the frank recognition of our own sins 
and weaknesses and a generous acknowledgment of the 
virtues and heroisms of other nations — even those 
whom we do not particularly like. The beauty of this 
program is that it is just the truth in place of distor- 
tion and self-deception ; it is scientific, magnanimous, 
worthy of a great and free people. But it is constantly 
_ threatened and retarded by the persistence of intense 
nationalism in the general public and will have to be 
worked out with infinite patience, intelligence, and 
resolution. 
Besides this universal duty of education which we 
share with all forward-looking nations, may we not 
well look into our own particular stock in trade for 
educational matter and agencies which may nurture 
the new spirit with peculiar power in American schools? 
In doing this we shall need to be on our guard against
-P-A-G-E-164
EDUCATION FOR WORLD ORDER 139 
the sin which so easily besets every people, of falling 
into pride and conceit over elements in the national 
life and character which are rather blessings of Provi- 
dence than virtues of our own. 
The resources of the United States for education 
toward the new order in international affairs are in- 
comparable. The original charter of our national 
existence is the first great political document to declare 
for the rights of all men merely as men; our country 
has participated for more than a century in preserving 
its most extensive frontier without arms of any sort, 
guarded solely by an international agreement — an 
absolutely new thing in history; our constitutional 
system embraces the most cosmopolitan citizenry ever 
united in a free government; our very political struc- 
ture is a union of originally independent states. Our 
treaty with Prussia in 1785 marked the “furthest 
north” in international comity at that time; of it 
Washington wrote: “It is the most liberal treaty 
which has ever been entered into between independent 
powers”: and Franklin, who had played the major 
réle in the negotiations, said: “I did my last public 
act in this country just before I set out, which was 
signing a treaty of amity and commerce with Prussia.” 
Not one of our national heroes has loved war: this 
is strikingly true of our military leaders, Washington, 
Grant, and in these days Pershing, Bliss, and other 
generals in our recent war, all have glorified peace and 
wished for the day when war should be abolished.
-P-A-G-E-165
140 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
Samuel Adams, aggressive revolutionist as he was, 
urged that our government should seek means to insure 
“that national differences may be settled and deter- 
mined without the necessity of war, in which the world 
has too long been deluged, to the destruction of human 
happiness and the disgrace of human reason and gov- 
ernment.” Jefferson, we are told by Henry Adams, 
“aspired beyond the ambition of a nationality, and em- 
braced in his view the whole future of man. He 
wished to begin a new era. Hoping for a time when the 
world’s ruling interests should cease to be local and 
should become universal, when questions of boundary 
and nationality should become insignificant, when 
armies and navies should be reduced to the work of 
police, he set himself to the task of governing with this 
golden age in view.” 
Franklin, shrewdest and most practical of men, was 
“an enemy of war in all its forms and disguises.” He 
summed up his long observations of international con- 
flicts in one pungent sentence, which crops up re- 
peatedly in his writings, that “there never was a good 
war nor abad peace.” The “ Old South Leaflets ” have 
gathered a twenty-page collection of his condemnations 
of war and his manifold proposals looking to interna- 
tional order and comity. “God grant,” he wrote near 
the end of his life, “that not only the love of liberty, 
but a thorough knowledge of the rights of man, may 
pervade all the nations of the earth, so that a philoso- 
pher may set his foot anywhere on its surface, and
-P-A-G-E-166

? say, ‘This is my country.’” Could any one go further 
in the aspiration for world-unity? More than this, 
Franklin, with his pragmatic nature, was ready to move 
for specific and practical means to the great end; he 
constantly labored for amicable and human treaty 
relations; he evidently had no aversion even to definite 
alliances looking toward peace, for he writes to an Eng- 
lish friend on the very year of the treaty which closed 
the Revolutionary War : — “What would you think of 
a proposition, if I should make it, of a compact between 
England, France, and America? America would be as 
happy as the Sabine girls, if she could be the means of 
uniting in perpetual peace her father and her husband. 
What folly these repeated wars !— You are all Chris- 
tians. — Manifest the propriety of these titles by your 
future conduct. ‘By this,’ says Christ, ‘shall all men 
know that ye are my disciples, if ye love one another.’ 
‘Seek peace and ensue it.’” 
William Penn, who alone gave his name to an Ameri- 
can commonwealth, wrote and published in 1693 one 
of the notable historical proposals for international 
“ unity, under the title “An essay towards the present 
and future peace of Kurope, by the establishment of 
an European Dyet, Parliament, or Estates.” This is 
a reasoned and eloquent plea for a League of Nations 
not greatly different from the League which is now the 
central theme in all discussions of world order: one 
cannot but admire the insight and foresight with which 
this document reckons with virtually every argument
-P-A-G-E-167
142 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
now used in debating the same theme, although written 
more than two centuries ago. 
Our foreign relations on the whole have been marked 
by two elements too rare in the general history of 
diplomacy : candor and a consideration of the interests 
of other nations. We should not ignore the weak 
places in our record; breaches of faith toward the 
Indian; discreditable passages connected with the 
Mexican War; possibly some undue haste in breaking 
with Spain in 1898; and some grave questions concern- 
ing our more recent actions in relation to Porto Rico, 
Haiti, and the Philippines. But it is quite legitimate 
to point out that all these cases even when given the 
most unfavorable interpretation were more than justi- 
fied by the traditional practice of strong nations toward 
the weak ; and that, nevertheless, no American political 
leader has ever dared to appeal to that justification but 
has found it necessary to set up a plea based upon moral 
grounds; hypocritical though such pleas may have 
sometimes been in the minds of those who had private 
interests to favor, there is no ground for doubting the 
honest conviction of the great mass of the people in 
every case. / 
The case of Cuba is of peculiar value. The whole 
force of diplomatic tradition would have supported the 
United States in complete annexation: whatever de- 
fects there are in our present relations with the island 
may be justly put down as the residuum due to the 
inevitable persistence of this tradition in competition
-P-A-G-E-168
EDUCATION FOR WORLD ORDER 143 
with the newer ideals; and whatever is worthy in the 
situation must be credited to the influence of these 
newer ideals. No one who knows the people of the 
United States can doubt that the vast bulk of them 
rejoice in every indication of the autonomy and self- 
direction of the Cuban Republic and regret any circum- 
stances which offer ground for our active intervention 
in its affairs. The original declaration of our gov- 
ernment in favor of Cuban independence was over- 
whelmingly approved by the people as a whole; every 
move which seemed to hazard that independence has 
required explanation as being really a step in fulfilling 
the original guarantee. 
The case of the Philippines is much less clear, at 
least from the educator’s point of view: it contains 
more unsavory incidents and is in general harder to 
reconcile with the historic standards of our country. 
The more recent acquisitions in the Caribbean belong 
in the same difficult category. Yet even in these we 
need not fear and must not evade the frankness which 
is the most basic necessity of education in the use of our 
own record: we dare not mislead the young citizen on 
any point of fact, great or small. If his country has 
done wrong, he is entitled to know it to the full extent 
of his power to comprehend, for he and his generation 
must needs inherit the good and evil and cope with the 
problems which will inexorably flow into the national 
destiny from national conduct. But frankness in edu- 
cation cannot confine itself to unfavorable circum-
-P-A-G-E-169
144 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
stances and expose only errors and defects in policy and 
administration; it must also present no less frankly 
the many grounds in favor of our procedure. The 
situation in the Philippines must not be set in odious 
comparison with some purely imaginary picture, as of 
the Philippine archipelago united, intelligent, free, 
prosperous, rejoicing in all the blessings of ideal democ- 
racy; we must rather put the hard pragmatic question 
between the islands under American tutelage on the 
one hand, with all the good and evil actually existing 
in that actual state, and on the other hand the entirely 
problematic condition which would result from the 
withdrawal of our control, with the manifest probabili- 
ties of internal confusion and bloodshed and the inter- 
vention of other powers even less likely than we are to 
be moved by any unselfish regard for the rights and wel- 
fare of the people of the islands. 
Positively the United States has done for the Philip- 
pines, as it did for Cuba, more than any other nation 
in history ever did for a people subject to its power. 
The immense work done for health and education alone 
is unparalleled in quality and extent and must be set 
down definitely to the credit of the United States. The 
best treatment ever given by other nations in similar 
situations compares but poorly with this record: in 
fact some countries ranked as civilized have never 
undertaken as much for the education of their own 
peoples as the United States has for the Filipinos. The 
cost to the American government and people has been
-P-A-G-E-170
EDUCATION FOR WORLD ORDER 145 
great, both in money and in human energy and life; 
no return has been made or even asked and none can 
be looked for unless it should come in entirely indirect 
form. The total increase in trade-profits would cover 
but a small part of this expenditure, and certainly not 
all the trade increase can be credited to the fact of 
American occupation. 
Most important of all, the United States has defi- 
nitely declared and confirmed the policy of ultimate 
independence for the islands; President Wilson prob- 
ably expressed the sense of the people as a whole in 1913 
when he said : 
We must hold steadily in view their ultimate independence, 
and we must move toward the time of that independence as 
steadily as the way can be cleared and the foundations thought- 
fully and permanently laid.... Step by step, we should extend 
and perfect the system of self-government in the Islands, making 
test of them and modifying them as experience discloses their suc- 
cess and their failures. 
Congress in 1916 reiterated this policy. Many steps 
have been taken in the direction indicated by President 
Wilson, and none have been retraced. There is no 
reason to doubt that the American people would re- 
joice in the consummation of Philippine independence 
as sincerely as they do in that of Cuba. 
Of the greatest importance in this connection are the 
relations of our country with China; it is within the 
truth to say that here the United States turned a new 
page in history as definitely as in the case of Cuba.
-P-A-G-E-171
146 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
The situation and our policy are told in a few words by 
Professor Beard in discussing the crisis at the time of 
the Boxer Rebellion : 
“For more than half a century, the imperial powers 
of Europe had been carving up the Chinese empire, 
taking to themselves territory, railway concessions, 
mining rights, ports, and commercial privileges at the 
expense of the huge but helpless victim. The United 
States alone among the great nations, while as zealous 
as any in pursuit of peaceful trade, had refrained from 
seizing Chinese territory or ports. Moreover, the 
Department of State had been urging European 
countries to treat China with fairness, to respect her 
territorial integrity, and to give her equal trading 
privileges with all nations.” This policy of decency 
and honor was skillfully yet unequivocally insisted 
upon by that finest of diplomats, the then Secretary 
of State, John Hay; and, as he wrote, “The moment 
we acted, the rest of the world paused, and finally 
came over to our ground.” Beard well adds, “In 
taking this position, the Secretary of State did but 
reflect the common sense of America.” ! 
As for the final incident of this particular episode one 
may search the history of diplomacy without finding 
its like: we refer to the well-known, and yet perhaps 
not well enough known, action of the United States in 
returning to China the unrequired balance of the in- 
demnity, and the action of China in devoting this 
1CHaries Buarb, History of the United States, pp. 500, 501; The Macmillan Co.
-P-A-G-E-172
EDUCATION FOR WORLD ORDER 147 
unexpected treasure, something like $16,000,000, to the 
education of Chinese youth in the country which had 
acted with such unprecedented fairness and generosity. 
Who ‘can estimate the streams of better international 
sentiment which have sprung from this decent and 
honest deed performed by a great and powerful nation 
toward the largest nation in the world in its hour of 
impotence and humiliation? There is something ro- 
mantic and touching in the whole event. 
We cannot pass from this theme without calling 
attention to the wisdom and nobility of John Hay and 
the extraordinary significance of his diplomatic prin- 
ciples with reference to world friendship and interna- 
tional honor. It is doubtful if there is another case in 
history of a great power being represented by a man so 
high-minded and at the same time so competent and 
effective. Of all notable figures in our recent history 
Hay seems to have embodied the spirit of his great mas- 
ter, Abraham Lincoln. To have bred and so honor- 
ably employed two such men is one of the glories of our 
country and should be one of our greatest resources in 
playing our great part in the new world order. 
The presidential election of 1920 is often put down as 
a national referendum on the question of the United 
States participating in a system of world order: cer- 
tainly it did constitute a decisive defeat, for the time 
being, of the specific issue before the people, which was 
the League of Nations bound up with the Versailles 
Treaty ; no one can question the fact that no incon-
-P-A-G-E-173
148 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
siderable part of the opposition came from those who 
would have welcomed the League but who were bitterly 
opposed to the Treaty. Furthermore, the campaign 
against the combined proposal was in the main bitterly 
partisan; and, finally, the advocate in chief of the 
Covenant, and incidentally of the Treaty, the then 
President, was even before the campaign began a 
stricken man and broke down completely in the midst 
of the contest ; no other voice could for a moment atone 
for this crushing loss. These three complications may 
well be counted one of the tragedies of history and 
surely afford ground for rejecting the election as in any 
sense a true and valid verdict of the American people 
upon the question of participating in world affairs. 
Over against this we may properly set two expres- 
sions of the opinion of the country which, while inferior 
in extent and official character, are infinitely superior 
by their freedom from complications of any sort, since 
they were the direct answer to a direct question. The 
first of these is found in the numerous polls of public 
opinion carried on before the beginning of the political 
campaign of 1920: most notable was the inquiry sent by 
the “ Literary Digest ” to editors of newspapers asking, 
not for the editor’s own opinion, but for his judgment of 
the general opinion of his community; this, it will be 
remembered, resulted in an enormous preponderance of 
opinion in favor of the League. The other is in prog- 
ress at this writing — the referendum on the “Bok 
Peace Plan.” Press reports inform us that up to Feb-
-P-A-G-E-174
EDUCATION FOR WORLD ORDER 149 
ruary 15 (1924), out of a grand total of 514,318 returns, 
449,568, or over 87 per cent, are in favor of the Plan. 
After making due allowance for the unofficial and 
limited character of these popular ballots, it must be 
admitted that they furnish ample ground for faith and 
hope in the positive willingness of the people of the 
United States to join with their sister nations and their 
fellow men in a definite and systematic movement for a 
new world order. 
Whatever may be our various opinions concerning 
the vast international debate and agitation over the 
League, it is impossible to deny that the international 
policy of the United States culminated for the time in 
the utterances and deeds of Woodrow Wilson, then 
President of the United States, now after great tribula- 
tions silent in death. If he erred, it was on the side of 
grandeur and faith and in the beginning with the pas- 
sionate support of the great mass of human beings in 
every land. The leading enemy of all Wilson’s ideal- 
istic proposals, the French Premier, pointed his attacks 
by the jeer that Wilson was too much like Jesus Christ : 
many who sided then with Clemenceau, the “Tiger,” 
even now look with horror upon Clemenceau’s country 
carrying out the “Tiger’s” policy in the Ruhr and the 
Saar Basin. Perhaps, after all, America’s President, 
even though too much influenced by the idealistic doc- 
trines of the Galilean, might have been as good a guide 
in the Versailles negotiations as the “Tiger” himself! 
At any rate, the American President may lay better
-P-A-G-E-175
150 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
claim to having followed the motto of his great predeces- 
sor, the first President of the United States, who said, 
“Let us erect a standard to which the wise and the just 
can repair. The event isin the hand of God.” Wilson 
was overruled, first in France by the shrewd and un- 
scrupulous representatives of the ancient diplomacy, 
and later by the overwhelming decision of his own 
people, wisely or not; so far as Europe is concerned God 
is not much in evidence, and France might even find 
herself occupying the same unenviable eminence of con- 
demnation but lately held by Germany. What faint 
signs of hope have arisen since the great arbitrament of 
1919 and 1920—the Conference on Limitation of 
Armaments, the International Court of Justice, and the 
painful advance of the crippled League of Nations — 
all point away from the “Tiger” and toward — shall 
we say it? toward Jesus Christ, or at least toward the 
lofty hopes and faith which Woodrow Wilson preached, 
with the support, at the time, of his own people and the 
nations of the world. 
Let us consider next a profoundly organic element in 
the relation of the United States to the problem of 
world unity and order. It is that our national family 
circle is an unparalleled example of the successful 
political and social consolidation of diverse racial 
stocks. If God “hath made of one blood all nations 
of the earth,” the Constitution of the United States 
has corroborated the divine principle by making of all 
strains and colors one nation, ‘‘dedicated to the propo-
-P-A-G-E-176
EDUCATION FOR WORLD ORDER 151 
sition that all men are created equal.” The Swiss 
Republic has long been admired as exemplifying the 
sound and harmonious union of peoples differing in 
speech and religion; but that nation is hardly more 
than a laboratory experiment compared with the Ameri- 
can Republic, which unites peoples differing in every 
conceivable natural trait. Viewed in this light the 
dull statistics of the census shine with prophetic light : 
gut of our one hundred five million of population in 
1920, those of foreign birth or foreign parentage make 
up the astounding total of more than thirty-six million, 
with almost every human race represented. Through 
these living members of our population we acquire 
blood-kinship with every great power in the whole 
earth; Germany leads all the rest with over seven 
and a quarter million; next comes the second partner 
in the “Central Powers” of the recent War, Austria- 
Hungary, with four and a quarter million; from Great 
Britain and Canada combined, a total of nearly six 
million; from Russia, nearly four million; from Italy, 
three and a third; and from the Scandinavian lands 
over three million. This goes back only one genera- 
tion: the real fact of admixture is of course far more 
dominant, for to the above figures we must first add 
the most extreme case of adoption, our ten million 
negroes, and then reckon with the diverse European 
origin of all our native white stock. 
All this admixture made itself dramatically manifest 
in the rolls of the “American Expeditionary Force” in
-P-A-G-E-177
152 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
the Great War : one cannot forget the war poster headed 
“Americans All,” bearing the names of men who had 
died on the field of battle: “DuBois, Smith, O’Brien, 
Cejka, Haucke, Pappandrikopolous, Andrassi, Levy, 
Turovich, Kowalski, Chriczanevicz, Knutson, Gon- 
zales.” To this might properly have been added some 
names, even further remote racially from the basic 
American stock, of American soldiers and citizens of 
Chinese and Japanese origin: while of course the negro 
contingent, with its full share of duty and sacrifice, 
was simply obscured by the ordinary American names 
which its members bore. 
The fact is that the people now united under the Con- 
stitution of the United States actually form a sort of 
representative assembly of the whole human family. 
The process has been and still is by and large an un- 
questionable success: the defects and imperfections, 
such as racial antagonisms, race-riots, exclusionism, and 
the like, deplorable. and serious as they are, are but 
minor exceptions to the general unity and harmony. 
The fact as a whole throws a beneficent light upon the 
great emergent problem of world unity and concord. 
If a population so cosmopolitan and polyglot can be 
successfully bound together in a solid nation under one 
flag and one government, why should it be thought im- 
possible that the nations from which this population is 
drawn may be united successfully into an appropriate 
form of world union which may outlaw war and build 
the guarantees of rational and human international
-P-A-G-E-178
EDUCATION FOR WORLD ORDER 153 
relations? This is the practical logic of our national 
experience from the beginning down to the present. 
We need to note one other consideration which lays 
a peculiar obligation upon the United States: that is 
the incomparable good fortune of our nation, for which 
we are indebted, after all, to the blood and traditions 
which we inherited from our European ancestry, and to 
the gifts of nature in the New World. This fortune is 
likely to prove, like the gospel, “a savor of life unto 
life, or of death unto death.” We must choose between 
the path of selfishness, which leads inevitably to dete- 
rioration and ultimate decay, and the path of moral 
energy, which alone can preserve and enhance the 
strength and virtues that are as indispensable to the 
health of nations as of individuals. 
We live secure, protected by our immense wealth, 
both human and material, and by our continental 
isolation. We are the happy heirs of the last great 
landed estate which history had to bestow. We have 
drawn into our body politic the blood of all the races, 
and we stand upon the shoulders of the past without 
being entangled too much in the limitations of tradi- 
tion. We have no violent hereditary antagonisms with 
other nations, such as tend so obstinately to hamper 
the international relations of other great powers. 
We are today the only great nation that can be con- 
sidered really prosperous; even after making all allow- 
ance for our internal ills, which are great and menacing, 
still our condition is enviable compared to England,
-P-A-G-E-179
154 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
France, Germany, Russia, Japan; only some of the 
minor powers can compare with us in domestic com- 
fort and tranquillity, and these smaller peoples are 
subject to international anxieties from which we are 
exempt. 
The logic of world order is irrefragable: the whole 
trajectory of history thus far leads to the wider and 
ever wider unity of the whole human race. From tiny 
family groups and small tribal units up through larger 
and larger social organizations, the political life of man 
has grown. In this respect, too, the opportunity and 
the duty of the United States are unique. Our system 
of government was the first and is still the leading great 
federation of free states and free people — forty-eight 
politically equal and sovereign states united into one 
indissoluble union ; with our liberty not diminished but 
enhanced thereby, and our internal welfare and ex- 
ternal safety promoted and guaranteed. One by one 
the barriers of nature which shut one group or race off 
from another have been broken down or bridged by 
human ingenuity; today the whole world is, as some- 
one has said, a neighborhood. It is a striking fact that 
communication and transportation are easier today 
between the farthest distant points in the civilized 
world than between the remote points in the United 
States at any time in the first half century of our 
national existence. To the whole orbis terrarum we 
may now apply Lincoln’s words at the time of threat- 
ened disruption of the Union: “Physically speaking we
-P-A-G-E-180
EDUCATION FOR WORLD ORDER 155 
camnot separate!” The railroad, the steamship, the 
airplane, the telephone, the telegraph, the radio have 
completely laid the physical basis for world unity, and 
actually compel world connection. It is interesting to 
note that four of these six inventions were made by 
Americans, and a fifth, the railroad, has been carried to 
its highest development here. Being so large a nation 
it was inevitable that we should seek devices to conquer 
distance, and so aid in binding the whole world together. 
All this leads to the great truth so admirably expressed 
by a leading American historian: 
There can be no secure peace now but a common peace of the 
whole world; no prosperity but a general prosperity, and this for 
the simple reason that we are all brought so near together and 
are so pathetically and intricately interdependent that the old no- 
tions of noble isolation and national sovereignty are magnificently 
criminal 
One great actual world-union has already been 
founded on the initiative of the United States — in the 
field of education. The first World Conference on 
Education — if not on any subject whatever — was 
held in July, 1923, and out of it emerged a permanent 
organization, the World Federation of Education Asso- 
ciations, The Conference was not a sudden impulse, 
but the matured result of three years of definite plan- 
ning in accordance with a definite program. The 
National Education Association, with an actual mem- 
bership of 180,000 teachers, and genuinely representing 
1 Jauus Hanver Rosinson, Mind in the Making, p. 229; Harper & Brothers.
-P-A-G-E-181
156 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
the whole body of American educational workers, 
formed the project and carried it out, with the manifest 
positive approval of its members. The delegates to the 
Conference represented every latitude and longitude 
of the inhabited earth; some of them literally traveled 
half way around the world to reach the place of meeting 
at San Francisco. The roster of officers of the World 
Federation, ten in number, represents eight countries 
—China, England, Japan, India, Scotland, Greece, Can- 
ada, and the United States. It is a notable fact that 
no speaker received a warmer welcome and more en- 
thusiastic applause than the delegate from Germany, 
who was no less a person than the Minister of Education 
from the State of Hesse. 
The objects of the Federation are stated in the con- 
stitution to be “to secure international codperation in 
educational enterprises, to foster the dissemination of 
information concerning education in all its forms among 
peoples and nations, to cultivate international good- 
will, and to promote the interests of peace throughout 
the world.” 
The response of the people of the United States to the 
Conference was remarkable; it is safe to say that no 
educational gathering ever before received so much 
attention in the press or aroused so much favorable 
comment. It is a significant index of the basis of 
international mindedness of the country, and of the 
world, when the disturbing and irritating influence of 
economic and political conflicts can be for the time
-P-A-G-E-182
EDUCATION FOR WORLD ORDER 157 
eliminated. The great national organization of Ameri- 
can teachers rejoiced in the success of the Conference 
and can be counted upon to continue their support, both 
spiritual and practical, in the further developmental 
processes of the Federation. In these days when 
leaders in all fields of human affairs are insisting upon 
the prime importance of education, such an event must 
be recognized as significant indeed. 
Thus is every young American citizen “compassed 
about with a cloud of witnesses” in the whole story of 
his nation. The words and deeds of the most authori- 
tative fathers of the Republic have predominantly 
favored the settlement of international problems by 
negotiation, mutual understanding, and conciliation : 
and this too has been the ruling motive in our foreign 
policy as a whole. The American school has invalu- 
able educative material in the utterances of Penn and 
Franklin and Jefferson and Hay and Wilson; in the 
distinctive diplomacy of the Rush-Bagot Agreement, 
so early in our history; and in our later relations with 
Cuba, China, and the Philippines. If he but looks 
about him, he finds that he is a member of the one nation 
in existence which is itself a genuine unity of all the 
races of mankind. Who can tell how much America’s 
response to the international situation following the 
Great War might have differed if the people in general 
had been more familiar with these notable elements in 
the history and traditions of the United States? And 
—to take a more hopeful view — if we will only avail

ourselves of these rich educational resources, who can 
put limits to the greatness and generosity which our 
country may yet contribute to the now vigorously 
renewed endeavor to enthrone wisdom and justice in 
the determination of world affairs?

CHAPTER IX 
THE EDUCATIVE USE OF HISTORY 
Tr education is, as Wells tells us, in a race with catas- 
trophe, it would seem pretty clear that political wisdom 
and righteousness must be among the most vital educa- 
tional aims. The state of the world today seems to 
indicate that the happiness of the human race in general 
cannot be advanced unless we can achieve reasonable 
success both in our particular national units and in the 
larger relations between the nations which make up 
what we may call world politics. I cannot avoid the 
conviction that this proposition is at the present mo- 
ment of paramount importance in the whole problem 
of education. Nor do I doubt that education is the 
only road to safety and happiness which the mind of 
man can conceive at this stage of human evolution. 
Facing, then, the specific task of cultivating in the 
rising generation these elements, political wisdom and 
righteousness, we have to look earnestly for those 
means which may give promise of attaining the aim. 
Among the branches of knowledge, one stands supreme 
in this respect, and that is history. Yet one is moved 
immediately to adapt Professor Robinson’s dictum 
concerning education in general to the special branch 
of history and say that it is quite true that what we need 
161
-P-A-G-E-187
162 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
‘is history, but something so different from what now 
passes as such that it needs a new name. To this we 
may add another sweeping but no less true proposition 
from the same great writer, that “we have to create 
an unprecedented attitude of mind to cope with unprec- 
edented conditions, and to utilize unprecedented knowl- 
edge.”’ * 
To the historian as such I am not so presumptuous 
as to offer a single word of advice: I set it down as a 
presupposition not to be questioned that he understands 
his business. It is explicitly as one who is not a his- 
torian that I write, but as one who is concerned with 
education and concerned more and more deeply every 
year with education for politics, national and inter- 
national. This paper is in the main an appeal from a 
teacher to the professional historian. _ Education can- 
not succeed without the aid of history ; political educa- 
tion cannot even begin without that aid; but it must 
be a form of history which touches the vital spots in 
political education, and it will have to be a history 
written for that very purpose and whose form and con- 
tent are dictated not primarily by the principles of 
history but by the demands of education. It should 
not be necessary to add that no demands of education 
could justify the slightest deviation from historical 
truth and sincerity; nor indeed is it conceivable that 
sound educational principles could tolerate any such 
deviation any more than sound historical principles.

THE EDUCATIVE USE OF HISTORY 163 
On every point of historicity the decision of the his- 
torian must be final: there is room enough to consider 
the interests of education without violating one jot 
of this inexorable law. 
For the ends of education the standard instruction 
has in large measure done those things which it ought 
not to have done and left undone those things which it 
ought to have done. Why should an American who 
has had the full experience of a liberal education find 
himself with only a scanty and superficial knowledge 
of even the greatest figures of his nation’s history? 
That is the actual situation of the vast majority of 
college-bred men and women: I speak with some 
assurance, for I made the sad discovery upon myself 
first, and later confirmed it by manifold tests upon 
others. The two most widely recognized, Washington 
and Lincoln, are to the great majority of our people 
hardly more than venerated names linked with a few 
trivial or even erroneous ideas. Washington’s ‘“‘Fare- 
well Address” is barely mentioned in our school his- 
tories. I confess that even after many discouraging 
observations on this point I was startled to find no 
reference whatever to this great document in Fiske’s 
history for schools. Lincoln called the Address “that 
immortal document,” and urged its reading on the 
oceasion of celebrating Washington’s birthday: but to 
the vast majority of Americans today it is not immortal 
but virtually dead. Practically only one of the sev- 
eral admonitions it contains is ever referred to, and
-P-A-G-E-189
164 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
that is usually misused by being cited without any of 
the very definite grounds which Washington himself 
assigned for it; that is, of course, his caution against 
“entangling alliances,” and almost every one of the 
conditions which Washington bases it upon has com- 
pletely passed away. Yet our national ignorance of 
the document as a whole exposes us to any kind of 
perversion of the principle. 
“Who was Herodes Atticus?” asked the teacher of a 
high school history class consisting of about twenty 
young American boys and girls; and some time was 
spent in elaborating on that ancient worthy. Being 
invited to talk to the class, I chose to question them, 
and asked whether Lincoln was ever in Congress; what 
Washington said in his “Farewell Address”; who 
Colonel Robert Gould Shaw was: on all these ques- 
tions in American history not one of the class could 
give a single correct idea. Not one of them could give 
a hint as to the basic political principles contained in 
the Declaration of Independence. Yet Colonel Shaw, 
probably unknown to nine hundred and ninety-nine 
out of every thousand Americans, is infinitely more 
worthy of attention than a dozen Herodes Atticuses: 
and the smallest significant fact in the life of Abraham 
Lincoln is of more value to Americanism than two 
thirds of the whole mass of ancient history which now 
forms so large a part of the high school pabulum. - 
Let me offer next a peculiarly striking example of 
this sin of omission — the Rush-Bagot Agreement.
-P-A-G-E-190
THE EDUCATIVE USE OF HISTORY 165 
It would be interesting to know how many of those who 
read these words have any sense of recognition of the 
fact they denote: not to know it does not expose one 
to any charge of unusual ignorance or of the lack of 
higher culture. Prior to 1917 hardly any of our school 
histories even mentioned it. John Fiske, sitting down 
to cull from his vast wealth of lore in American history 
the choicest essence for the minds of young Americans, 
has not a word for this Agreement. In the index where 
Bagot might have stood are Nathaniel Bacon, N. P. 
Banks, John Bell, the Earl of Bellamont, Henry Boquet, 
Braxton Bragg, John Breckinridge, Philip Broke, John 
Brown, Robert Brown, D. C. Buell. Under Canada 
(with which of course the Agreement has to do) are two 
items: “conquered by the English” and “invaded by 
Americans.” 
Since the Great War the Rush-Bagot Agreement has 
managed to get mentioned in some of the school his- 
tories. One of the latest, and one of the best, the joint 
work of a distinguished educator and a distinguished 
historical scholar, truly declares that it “deserves to be 
classed among the highest achievements of humanity” : 
yet so strong is the pressure of the traditional emphasis 
that this great achievement is dismissed with the . 
meager allowance of eight lines! 
When the great Conference on the Limitation of 
Armaments met in Washington, few indeed were the 
persons in the United States who were aware that their 
own country had shared in a disarmament agreement
-P-A-G-E-191
166 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
more than a century previous, and that the agreement 
had not only been scrupulously observed by both 
parties but had actually been extended by tacit prac- 
tice far beyond its technical limits. Few reflected upon 
the century-old unarmed peace which had reigned upon 
the three-thousand mile border between the United 
States and Canada. When men derided the idea 
of disarmament and belittled the hopes of the Con- 
ference, it was rare indeed that any one stood by to 
cité this great successful experience. 
It is refreshing to quote from one school history which 
gives even a brief account : 
This competition in building warships was likely to prove a 
constant menace to cordial relations between the United States 
and its neighbor. Accordingly a wiser course was adopted. Great 
Britain sent Charles Bagot to Washington with positive instruc- 
tions to promote cordial relations with the United States. In 
1817, the two nations signed the Rush-Bagot Agreement, by which 
they bound themselves to maintain no warships on the Great Lakes.! 
Who did this noble and far-seeing deed? What are 
the names, worthy to be revered forever, of those men 
in the older country who first saw the vision of this 
“wiser course’”’—a course which today, after more 
than a century, the whole world demands to be taken 
for all nations? Who were the men in the councils of 
the United States who were wise enough and strong 
enough to join hands with their recent enemies in so 
magnanimous and at the same time so practical an ac- 
tion? Alas, they have no monument either in marble

THE EDUCATIVE USE OF HISTORY 167 
or in the conscious gratitude of the millions who today 
in Canada and the United States live in stable and 
happy concord because of their wiser course in 1817. 
I have dwelt thus upon this case because it so well 
exemplifies both the positive and the negative side of 
the question. It is omitted or slighted because it has 
little appeal to the unawakened imagination: there 
was nothing spectacular in the original agreement or 
in the century-long development which followed. The 
whole process was quiet, and noise has had far too much 
to do with the selection of historical matter, especially 
in textbooks. Most notorious has been the undue 
emphasis upon war. Xerxes and Alexander and Cesar 
and Napoleon ramp through the pages of history, and 
their raucous clamor drowns the softer tones of far 
more pregnant elements in the evolution of humanity. 
But how profoundly constructive was the process 
which grew out of the Rush-Bagot Agreement. It has 
grown like the mustard-seed of the parable, hidden in 
the fertile soil of the age and silently spreading its 
beneficent influence over the whole frontier of contact 
between the two great peoples, and year by year striking 
its roots deeper into the very tissue of their common 
life. Surely this magnificent event has a history: but 
it has apparently never been written, partly because 
the pens of the writers have been engrossed with the 
stories of more conspicuous processes of less construc- 
tive character. Is it a small thing to have created the © 
first great unarmed international boundary, and to have
-P-A-G-E-193
168 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
maintained it inviolate for a hundred years? Educa- 
tive history cannot spare such chapters in the story of 
human advance. 
In actual practice the curse of history teaching is 
the eternal burden of “covering the ground”: this is 
an incident to the “block” system in the curriculum. 
Ancient history must be covered, then medieval and 
modern, then perhaps English, and finally American: 
this is the standard high school course. At the end of 
each block, and still more at the end of the whole 
series, the student finds his mind in much the same state 
as the Spartan who had listened to a prolix petition 
from the envoys of a suppliant people: “Touching 
your exordium, I have forgotten it; the body of your 
discourse I no longer hold in mind; as to your conclu- 
sion, I will do nothing in it.” 
The selection of material is the first task toward 
making history educative. Instead of covering the 
ground we must have an intelligent goal and drive 
toward it. There is only one key to selection, and that 
is the present, and, so far as human wisdom may judge 
it, the future which is flowing out of the present. Those 
actions in history which are still living and which are 
thrusting their forces into the future are the substance 
of the future. It might be well to reverse the chrono- 
logical order and begin with things as they are, tracing 
the vital elements in the life of man today backward 
into their receding stages and to their earliest discern- 
ible origins, thus excluding the obsolete.
-P-A-G-E-194
THE EDUCATIVE USE OF HISTORY 169 
This is after all only seeing history for what it is, a 
phase of the general process of evolution. The rationale 
of the sea-anemone is found in man: the explanation 
of the lower is the higher. 
Tf you can look into the seeds of time, 
And tell which grain will grow and which will not, 
Speak then to me. 
Something like this is the problem of educative history. 
The great bulk of human experience after all has never 
even been recorded but is lost in oblivion; nor can we 
rely upon the unrevised judgment of those who wrote 
to determine the true importance of the manifold 
happenings which they do chronicle. The Rush-Bagot 
Agreement serves as an example: it is doubtful if any- 
thing that occurred in the same decade can compare 
with it in significance for the present and the future. 
“Mere facts,” which so often weary and repel the 
pupil in history, are unrelated facts and therefore 
meaningless. The Egyptian pyramids and royal tombs 
are matters of idle curiosity to most students; occasion- 
ally one may wonder in a vague way why anybody 
should have bothered with such useless labors: yet a 
single fact usually not found in school treatment — 
that the Great Pyramid absorbed the labor of a hundred 
thousand men for twenty years — turns the otherwise 
bare fact of these ancient structures into a landmark 
of human progress. They become a witness of the 
hopeless suppression of the common man, and the 
equally hopeless stupidity of the overlords of that
-P-A-G-E-195
170 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
ancient period. It would thus contribute to one of the| 
vital elements in historical mindedness, a sense of the 
infinite superiority of the present over the past: most 
people are almost entirely lacking in this sense, and 
are constantly deluded by the fallacy of the * ‘good old 
times.” 
The present method of organizing the facts of history 
solely under the categories of national or racial divisions 
is an insuperable bar to full efficiency in revealing the 
significance of the facts and of history as a whole. It 
may well be admitted that every child should be intro- 
duced to the special history of his own race and nation: 
beyond that he should study not the stories of nations 
but the history of great human movements. The vast 
mass of the history of any foreign land is foreign to 
the mind of the young learner : this is true for us in the 
United States and even of England, which is by far the 
closest to us. Yet much of our own history is linked 
up with English experience and can be clearly under- 
stood only in the light of the relevant portions of Eng- 
lish history. But other histories besides English have 
light for us: two in particular may be named, the 
Dutch and the Swiss; but, under the present system, 
practically no American student gets any real insight 
into the relevant portions of these histories. It is safe 
to say that not one American in a thousand knows that 
the Dutch issued a “Declaration of Independence,” 
embodying explicitly the same fundamental doctrine 
of sovereignty as does ours, nearly two hundred years
-P-A-G-E-196
THE EDUCATIVE USE OF HISTORY 171 
before our Revolution: they, too, revolted against 
immensely superior forces, and made good their revolt. 
The Swiss, of course, have a federal republic which is 
on the whole more like our system of government than 
any other in history. We could easily make room in 
our present history instruction for these vital items by 
cutting out a negligible fraction of the dead wood we 
carry. Yet the bulk of the history of the Netherlands 
and of Switzerland would have only the interest of 
curiosity for us, and it would be absurd to propose in-~ 
troducing these as subjects in our curriculum. 
Almost the same might be said of the history of 
Greece: the bulk of it as studied is dead to us, and, as 
every one knows, is forgotten almost as soon as the ex- 
amination is over at the end of the course. But some 
things in the life and achievements of the Greeks are 
vital to all modern life and particularly to us as a demo- 
cratic people. Socrates is far more alive today than 
the great majority of the names to be found in the in- 
dexes of any of our school histories, even those dealing 
with our own land. Yet I have repeatedly asked col- 
lege seniors and juniors who had “had” Greek history 
how it came to pass that the Athenians put Socrates 
to death, and never got any intelligent response; most 
of them frankly said they could not tell and never had 
thought about it. But the spirit of Socrates is being 
tried and condemned in the United States today in 
religion and politics and social affairs: we pretend to 
honor him, as he is safely dead, but we are little more
-P-A-G-E-197
      172 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
willing than his judges were to listen to any one whi 
wishes to teach us truths we dislike. 
For the American citizen the study of American 
tory must be recognized as paramount and controlling. 
Its emotional appeal is unique and basic, and emotional 
appeal is indispensable to every approach to the educa- 
tion of the will. Our own national experience is the 
arch through which we behold the vista of all human 
experience. To neglect it, or to fall short of both truth 
and warmth in the pursuit of it, would be even a greater 
loss than to ignore the history of our sister nations: 
but either defect is fatal to the full educative power of 
history. The besetting error here as elsewhere is to 
lose the meaning in the multitude of unrelated facts; 
even the facts then soon fall into oblivion by the inex- 
orable law of memory. Whoever will make even a 
slight examination of the actual knowledge of college 
students in the field of American history will be im- 
pressed with the fruitlessness of our schooling in this 
respect. 
Tt is our own experience which reveals the vital ele- 
ments in life for us, and these elements afford the only 
clue to our excursions into the larger history of man- 
kind. In this respect our fortune is incomparable, 
because we came into the arena in the fullness of days 
and have inherited the dominant political and social 
wealth of the ages. Our national history is a house full 
of windows looking out upon the history of mankind. 
Our original ancestry comes from the best sources in
-P-A-G-E-198
THE EDUCATIVE USE OF HISTORY 173 
our European background; our later development has 
linked us up with the other great component of human- 
ity — across the Pacific in Asia. All this is organic 
and, as it were, subconscious : since 1898 and still more 
since 1917 our unity with the whole world has risen to 
consciousness and intelligence. If we will only follow 
the logic of the situation, it will lead us into the fullest 
and richest contact with history as a whole. 
One cannot pass the theme of our own history with- 
out an earnest plea for complete candor and sincerity 
in dealing with it. It has been the custom, especially 
in schools, to distort history into self-flattery; to be- 
little or ignore our own faults and errors and make much 
of those of other nations, especially our enemies. This 
is a natural and inevitable survival of the war songs of 
the savage, extolling his own valor and prowess and 
deriding his enemies: it is deep-rooted in our human 
nature, and doubtless served its evolutionary function in 
primitive life. It is in conflict with every line of human 
progress today —- science, modern jurisprudence, the 
new world-unity. It cannot be reconciled with the 
great dictum of Jesus, “Ye shall know the truth, and 
the truth shall make you free.” Let us have faith that 
our past is good enough without either concealment or 
fictitious gilding, or at least that we are strong and wise 
enough to look it in the face; and that we shall be 
stronger and wiser by doing so, untrammeled and 
unafraid. 
We need also to know the internal weaknesses and
-P-A-G-E-199
174 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
evils of past epochs of our history: these have been so 
glossed over as to foster one of the most pernicious and 
deadly fallacies that can beset any individual or any 
nation — that we are now a degenerate and decadent 
people. Our children look out upon the corruption, the 
selfishness, the bitter antagonisms and wranglings of 
the present; upon crime, and poverty, -and social dis- 
cord; upon ineffective education and civic incompe- 
tence and neglect; they compare all this now existing 
with a denatured portrayal of the past, in which all men 
were patriotic, in which the nation was solidly united 
and gloriously successful; what can be the result, if 
they think at all, except a growing sense of inferiority 
and despair? This is one of the grounds of two of our 
most dangerous symptoms — the widespread cynicism 
of the intellectuals toward democracy as a whole and 
our own democracy in particular; and the deep sense 
of injustice among those who find themselves discrim- 
inated against socially and economically and lacking 
what they really believe is the minimum of true free- 
dom. If the truth were told in history, much of the 
ground would be cut out from under these two danger- 
ous tendencies. , 
How many of our children have ever been allowed to 
reflect that the sufferings of Washington’s army at 
Valley Forge not only afford a touching and powerful 
picture of heroism and resolution, but also cast a shadow 
upon the political weakness and public neglect. which 
permitted the brave soldiers of the infant Republic to
-P-A-G-E-200
THE EDUCATIVE USE OF HISTORY - 175 
starve and freeze while many lived in comfort or even 
luxury? How many know that, in the “critical period” 
after the war, Washington almost despaired of the 
national existence? He wrote: 
I am mortified beyond expression when I view the clouds which 
have spread over the brightest morn that ever dawned upon any 
country. . . . I am lost in amazement when I behold what in- 
trigue, ignorance, and jealousy are capable of effecting. . . . What 
a triumph for the advocates of despotism to find that we are in- 
capable of governing ourselves! 
How many Americans; in school or out, have ever 
read or even heard of the Report on the Mexican War, 
written by the admirable and patriotic Charles Sumner, 
then Senator from Massachusetts, and passed almost 
unanimously by the Massachusetts legislature, in which 
the war was denounced in the severest terms? The 
resolutions declare : 
Such a war of conquest, so hateful in its objects, so wanton, so 
unjust, and unconstitutional in its origin and character, must be 
regarded as a war against freedom, against humanity, against 
justice, against the Union, against the Constitution, and against 
the Free States. 
How illuminating such an historical fact as this, 
completely documented, authenticated by the illus- 
trious name of its chief sponsor and by the decisive 
official act of an American commonwealth whose serv- 
ices to liberty are unrivaled! How can such an inci- 
dent reflect upon or damage true patriotism? How 
can it fail to correct the pernicious misconceptions 
which persuade us to despair of our country today?
-P-A-G-E-201
176 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
These are but chance examples of a type which may be 
multiplied indefinitely. 
Returning now to the question of history as a whole, 
let us ask what might some of the branches of history 
be, in the place of the present nationalistic annals? 
First, for us at least, the history of liberty. Who could 
forget Socrates after once apprehending his serene and 
valiant vindication of the very heart of liberty, the 
freedom of the soul itself, within itself and in its en- 
vironment? The downfall of Athens would then be a 
brilliant example of the enormous difficulty of the 
democratic form of government and society, and Cleon 
might warn us against our own specious demagogues. 
Sparta, now a sort of fable teaching a stupid kind of 
hardihood, would appear as the ancient example of the 
futility of making the citizen the mere pawn of the 
state — as Prussia is the modern instance. Roman 
history would be rescued from its present intolerable 
dullness by laying far more emphasis upon agrarian 
conflicts, and the struggles of the plebs; the Gracchi 
would appear as the real heroes of the drama, and even 
Cesar might be shorn of part of his unmerited pre- 
eminence in both history and the courses in Latin. 
It is the development of liberty that really concerns 
us in most of the history of England: the very early 
periods are virtually meaningless: the Norman kings, 
the Angevins, even the Tudors, have only a poetic or 
dramatic interest, well enough if we have time for them, 
which in the school period certainly we have not. The
-P-A-G-E-202
THE EDUCATIVE USE OF HISTORY 177 
fight of the Parliament against the Stuarts is our own 
history almost as much as our own Revolution; a good 
deal of the physical blood of our Revolutionary stock 
came direct from these English revolutionists, and still 
more of the spirit of Bunker Hill and the Declara- 
tion of Independence. The very failure of the English 
Commonwealth has lessons of profound interest for 
every lover of free political institutions. 
Of the paramount importance of the history of lib- 
erty, and its entire feasibility as a definite subject of 
study, I am absolutely convinced. This is not the 
place for setting forth any comprehensive scheme for 
these possible branches, nor do I presume to undertake 
such an enterprise: it is a problem for the joint en- 
deavors of historians and educators. 
The unity of the whole world of humanity is certainly 
another great phase or current; this “seed of time” 
germinated long ago in obscurity, and is now for the 
first time growing into full visibility. One more I will 
set out briefly: the history of labor or of the laboring 
class. Most of this history was submerged even while 
it oceurred, and little record has ever been made of it 
until our own day. It is only three or at most four 
generations since laboring men were indicted in both 
England and the United States for daring to unite with 
the purpose of raising their wages and improving their 
conditions of life. But those feeble beginnings of labor 
organization certainly proved to be one of the most 
potent seeds of history now to be reckoned with by
-P-A-G-E-203
178 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
every one who desires to understand his times. Yet 
even now our school instruction practically ignores the 
whole movement ; the most trivial and inconsequential 
topics get more space and consideration. In the educa- 
tion of an American citizen in the twentieth century, 
the history of labor is far more worthy of a quarter or 
a semester of study than the history of any foreign 
country, not excepting even Greece or England. One 
of the grave defects of history as it is written and 
studied today is its prevailing silence and neglect toward 
this great and growing interest. The momentous event 
of the accession of a “labor government” in England, 
perhaps the most striking positive political episode 
since the war, takes the bulk of the American people 
quite unprepared to understand its significance; in 
general their schooling, at least, has failed to give them 
the slightest background for intelligence concerning 
this great incident. 
The type of study here proposed is neither unscien- 
tific in its structure nor educationally superficial. It 
is far more closely allied to the methods of modern 
biological science than is the present procedure. The 
history of liberty has more logical unity than the history 
of a country or even of a race: this is most strikingly 
true of recent periods and most of all of the present, 
when the whole orbis terrarum is bound together by 
intercommunications of all sorts, spiritual and material. 
Such study would certainly not be lacking in mental 
discipline of the finest type: it would exact more co-

THE EDUCATIVE USE OF HISTORY 179 
herent and progressive and systematic thinking than 
the present. plan of stringing facts upon the calendar 
of years within the restricted bounds of a geographical 
unit. It might also help well to liberate people of 
various races from the perilous influences of provincial 
nationalism and open their eyes to the unity and infinite 
hopes of mankind as a whole. 
The greatest of all the potential blessings of the right 
study of history is that our people should achieve an 
enlightened sense of progress, and from it a release from 
the existing fear and hate of new proposals simply be- 
cause they are new. Jesus described all the generations 
thus far in his scathing denunciations of the rulers of 
his own day: “Your fathers slew the prophets and ye 
build monuments to these same prophets.” The very 
essence of evolution is the emergence of the new: the 
one thing which history never does is to repeat; the 
man or the nation which insists upon looking back 
rather than forward is doomed to a fate no better than 
that of Lot’s wife. History has dilated upon the 
“slory that was Greece and the grandeur that was 
Rome,” and has forgotten to tell the whole truth by 
describing also the primitive ethics and the human 
degradation which made up the bulk of the actual life 
of those ancient and undeveloped times. Even feudal- 
ism has been gilded by poetry and fiction so that its 
portrait in the minds of most men even among the 
educated is a mere tinsel show, concealing all manner of 
medieval abominations. A few pages transcribed from
-P-A-G-E-205
180 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
Plutarch’s “Lives” or Froissart’s “Chronicles” would 
be a wonderful corrective of this false image of “ good 
old times.” Truer than any standard history of Eng- 
land are Mark Twain’s “The Prince and the Pauper” 
and “Joan of Arc”; let us make these a part of the 
collateral reading in our courses in European history ; 
they will not have to be “required” either! 
Yet this insistence upon the full truth concerning 
other ages is no mere denunciation and must not breed 
in us a self-conceited superiority. How shallow our 
condemnation of the Athenians for the judicial murder 
of Socrates, or of the Jews for the crucifixion of Jesus, 
unless we remember also that only the Attic Greeks 
could furnish the hereditary stirps and the social en- 
vironment for a Socrates, and only the little nation of 
the Jews had the supernal stuff for a Jesus. So com- 
plex and so instructive is the thing we call history when 
rightly illuminated by all the facts. 
The dogmas of any past are inadequate to the pres- 
ent: our case is always new, and we shall always have 
to think anew and act anew. This is the supreme les- 
son of history, and the supreme joy of human life. As 
Jean Paul has said : “No Golden Age calls itself golden : 
it only looks for the Golden Age.” This is the same as 
the old Hebrew’s saying: “Where there is no vision, 
the people perisheth.”” Of the historian we may say as 
Kant said of the philosopher, “Unless he minister to the 
freedom of man, he is of less account than the laborer 
in the fields.”

To have bred Abraham Lincoln, to have loved him so 
passionately, to have followed his leadership in our 
stormiest crisis, is great praise ; when we remember that 
America did these things, we may well lift up our hearts 
and take courage. For, since the Man of Galilee, no 
human being has been loved and venerated so widely 
by mankind the world around as this same Lincoln. 
And he was all American. In forming him, says 
Lowell, Nature 
Threw her old world molds aside, 
And choosing sweet clay from the breast 
Of the unexhausted west, 
With stuff untainted shaped a hero new, 
Wise, steadfast in the strength of God, and true. 
But although it is so short a time since he lived and 
moved among us, and though thousands still live who 
shared the stormy years over which his spirit ruled, we 
are as a people, in the main, woefully ignorant of his 
real character and greatness. Our minds are filled with 
other thoughts, the press of the day’s work, the crowded 
scenes of current history, the swift advance of knowl- 
edge, the momentous problems of our own times — and

Lincoln is almost forgotten; he has become a ven- 
erated name, with no vital and positive meaning. 
How strange that the first great Lincoln play should 
have been written by a foreigner, played first in a foreign 
land, where thousands thronged to see it and strong men 
wept at the pathos and tragedy of the great episodes 
of Lincoln’s life and at the truths expressed in words 
taken direct from his lips and pen! And although the 
writer of that play wrote explicitly for his own people, 
and knew nothing of Lincoln’s country or Lincoln’s 
people, yet America, too, was and is still captivated and 
deeply moved by that foreign-born drama of the great 
American. Stranger still, the writer of the play, the 
Englishman, John Drinkwater, drew his inspiration and 
his matter from a life of Lincoln written by another 
Englishman, Lord Charnwood; and Charnwood’s life 
is perhaps the truest and profoundest estimate yet 
made of Lincoln’s character and greatness. Must 
we not grieve that America should have left this 
noble achievement to alien hands? Is not our educa- 
tion, in school and out, in some measure to blame for 
this demerit? 
We cannot afford to lose the memory, rich and vital, 
of our noble dead. All the best races of history have 
nurtured their patriotism and vitalized their national 
aspirations through intimate knowledge of their own 
greatest men. The Greek boy was educated largely 
on Homer’s poems, and Homer’s poems were made up 
absolutely of the mighty deeds and noble characters of
-P-A-G-E-210
ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND AMERICAN EDUCATION 185 
the ancestral heroes of the Greeks; the Hebrew race, 
the only other people whose part in human progress 
compares with that of the Greeks, worshiped not their 
ancestors indeed, but the God of their ancestors — 
Jehovah was the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. 
With all respect to Achilles and Agamemnon and 
Odysseus, and even to the Hebrew patriarchs, we must 
insist that we have even nobler forefathers, of our own 
race and representing our own vastly advanced moral . 
and political ideals. But we are in imminent peril of 
losing, and losing forever, the most profound values of 
these national examples, for it is now that we most need 
them. 
Let no one confuse this with slavish allegiance to the 
past: Washington and Lincoln do not belong to the 
past, not even to the present, but to our noblest future. 
Lincoln was far in advance of his times, and our own 
times have not yet overtaken his principles. The very 
virtues embodied in his life and the very ideals which 
inspired his political action are the hope of our national 
integrity today — and indeed of the welfare of the 
whole world and the continued advance of humanity. 
When we invite our children to look at Lincoln, we 
invite them to look forward into the splendid future. 
Lincoln was rejected by his own people almost as much 
as was Socrates or Jesus or Savonarola, or any other 
prophet or martyr. 
Before the Civil War broke out, Lincoln’s counsel of 
justice and moderation, of fairness to both South and
-P-A-G-E-211
       
        186 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
North, wererejected by both North and South. Durin 
the war his most earnest pleas for compensated emanci 
pation, which he believed to be just and which he bi 
lieved might quickly end the war, failed to convine 
even those who would have most benefited by it; whe 
the conflict of arms drew toward a close and the prob: 
lem of reconstruction arose, Lincoln’s generous anc ~~* 
practically wise plan of conciliation was bitterl: 
posed by congress and the noisier elements ol 
North; it is probable that only his death spared him 
from the contemptuous rejection of those noble and| 
far-seeing policies — so far was he in advance of his 
own times on those immediate issues. 
That he was also in advance of even the presen! 
of democratic progress let his definition of democracy 
indicate; a definition which seems to have escaped 
the notice of most if not all of his American biographers 
and has been rescued by Charnwood and given ~ 
place of honor as the closing sentence of his life 
Lincoln : ° 
“As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a mas- 
ter. This expresses my idea of democracy. Whatever 
differs from this, to the extent of that difference, is no 
democracy.” 
I know of no truer statement of the very spirit of the 
Declaration of Independence or of our national ideals. 
The formula affords a touchstone with which to try 
men and measures ; it constitutes a gauge to estimate, if 
anything can estimate it, the “per cent” of any man’s
-P-A-G-E-212
ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND AMERICAN EDUCATION 187 
Americanism. I fear that some “100 per cent Ameri- 
cans” by their own testimony would rank but poorly 
on this test. 
It is true that utterances like these, taken as mere 
words, are of little account; but Lincoln’s whole life, 
private and public, was true to this lofty test ; in every 
crisis, on every trial, he showed himself ready and able 
to put aside personal advantage and private profit, in 
order to serve the cause of human freedom; he desired, 
to use his own words, ‘‘that all men, everywhere, might 
be free.” 
For the educator Lincoln has extraordinary advan- 
tages. His is a name to conjure with; against his voice 
or his example no man dare raise cavil or utter con- 
tempt; though we may be little acquainted with the 
warp and woof of Lincoln’s life and character, we are 
passionately loyal to his memory and utterly convinced 
of his wisdom and patriotism and of his personal right- 
eousness, Any teacher who aspires to lead his pupils 
into paths of private virtue and civic loyalty, as well as 
into the most advanced social and political policies, can 
find in the practice and doctrines of Lincoln abundant 
matter which none can challenge. He had a remark- 
able and prophetic insight into social and economic 
truths, as may be well seen in certain passages in his 
great message on compensated emancipation, of Decem- 
ber 1, 1862, and in his classic discussion of the relations 
of capital and labor, found in his first annual message 
in 1861; few political documents go deeper into this
-P-A-G-E-213
188 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
question, then little perceived and obscured by the 
slavery issue: 
Labor is prior to and independent of capital. — Labor is the su- 
perior of capital and deserves much the higher consideration. Cap- 
ital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other 
rights. Nor is it to be denied that there is and probably always 
will be a relation between labor and capital, producing mutual 
benefits. 
Moreover his story is full of fascination for the young : 
his mighty bodily strength, his prowess as a wrestler, 
his supremacy among the pioneers as the champion 
axman whose strokes were so swift and powerful as to 
give the impression of two or three men at work; these 
things charm the most difficult of pupils, the adolescent 
boy, and enchain his attention for deeper truths. His 
humor, almost as unique as that of Mark Twain him- 
self, is an inexhaustible charm; the lesson can never 
get dull, for children of all ages love a joke just as Lin- 
coln did. His very “ugliness,” a favorite topic of jokes 
for himself, becomes a sort of magnet to draw men to 
him; and how magically it could be transformed ! 
At the end of his great “Lost Speech,” as he came for- 
ward with his tremendous climax, a hearer says, “He 
was at that moment the handsomest man I ever saw!” 
Taken all together, the figure of Lincoln makes the 
most potent human document that the American school 
can use. Moral preachments have after all but slight 
and precarious effect. They are dangerously apt to 
turn to quick weariness in the pupil and even end by
-P-A-G-E-214
ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND AMERICAN EDUCATION 189 
repelling him from the very virtues which they are 
intended to recommend. But “truth embodied in a 
tale” enters in and finds a welcome and a permanent 
abiding place in the soul. Noble sentiments and high 
ideals have an almost magic power when clothed in a 
beloved human form. This is the educative potency of 
Lincoln; it has been too little used; its fuller realiza- 
tion in homes and school is one of the most promising 
lines of educational advance. 
The elements which made Lincoln great are imitable, 
for they are the common virtues of humanity. He was 
not a genius, like Shakespeare, or Raphael, or Beetho- 
ven, placed upon a pedestal out of the reach of ordinary 
men. Such figures are of little use in education. It is 
futile to recommend them to boys and girls as pat- 
terns to emulate. Lincoln was great indeed, a genuine 
“superman,” but in an entirely different way. He 
was, as one of his closest friends said, ‘‘a common man 
expanded to gigantic proportions.” It would be hard 
to find or make a better short description. Genius is 
a rarity, found in the few, needed in only a few. It is 
the uncommonest gift of thrifty nature and cannot be 
created by human ingenuity nor by the most assiduous 
training. 
But there are virtues that every man must possess 
who claims to be a man at all. These virtues Lincoln 
had, and he had them in an extraordinary degree and in 
admirable harmony. This is what made him great and 
empowered him to achieve the almost unexampled
-P-A-G-E-215
190 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
tasks of his career. This beauty and power of common| 
human nature renders Lincoln’s life and character 
supremely fitted for educative use. Far more than 
most of the distinguished figures of history, he may 
serve as stimulus and {deal. 
Difficult as it is to describe character, let us try to 
state some of the simplest elements in Lincoln’s make- 
up. First, he loved truth: but what does this mean? 
All men claim this for themselves; how does this man 
prove his distinctive merit? Briefly thus: he invari- 
ably faced all the facts in the case, refusing to evade or 
obscure those that might seem to be unfavorable to his 
side, and insisting inexorably upon those that dictated 
the true conclusion; he applied to these facts the sin- 
cerest and most rigorous logic; and he practiced the 
admirable art of simple and luminous utterance. In 
brief, he thought clear and straight himself and helped 
those about him to do the same. 
He tells of this trait in his very boyhood ; he used to 
walk the floor of his little bedroom under the roof, 
“trying,” as he says, “to make out the exact meaning 
of some of their, to me, dark sayings. I could not sleep 
... until I had caught it. This was a kind of passion 
with me, and it has stuck by me, for I am never easy 
now, when I am handling a thought, till I have bounded 
it north, and bounded it south, and bounded it east, and 
bounded it west.” 
How significant these words, when we recall that this 
man, more than any other human power, first bounded
-P-A-G-E-216
ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND AMERICAN EDUCATION 191 
the slavery problem by his irrefutable logic and then 
led his people in the terrible task of banning the curse 
of slavery from the land of freedom. 
In the noted debates which first brought Lincoln to 
national fame, his relentless logic was so completely 
triumphant that Douglas was unable thereafter to win 
with either North or South. During the long agony of 
war it was Lincoln’s clear vision that refuted all argu- 
ments for compromise on the central question — that 
of union or disunion. But for that clear vision, it is 
almost certain that the country would have been split, 
perhaps without a blow being struck. 
As an excellent example both of what is good thinking 
in the sense here intended and also of certain charac- 
teristics of Lincoln’s thinking, his great Cooper Union 
address may serve. This has been called the most 
important speech he made prior to his election to the 
presidency, and also the most systematic and powerful 
statement he ever made of the case against slavery. 
It undoubtedly formed one of the two or three most 
important steps leading to his nomination and election, 
for it was his first notable introduction to the leaders 
of the Eastern States. Its style throughout was, in the 
words of Nicolay and Hay, “the quiet, searching exposi- 
tion of the historian and the terse, compact reasoning 
of the statesman”; all of which probably somewhat 
surprised and certainly deeply impressed his New York 
audience. 
»And why is this so good an example of thinking?
-P-A-G-E-217
192 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
Because Lincoln in this address seized upon a piece of 
Douglas’s rhetoric, intended to keep people from true 
thinking and to lure them to an opinion unfounded in 
truth, and completely turned the utterance against 
Douglas by the simple process of thorough and honest 
examination of the facts in the case. Douglas had said, 
“Our fathers, when they framed the government under 
which we live, understood this question just as well, and 
even better, than we do now” ; — implying, and doubt- 
less leading his hearers to suppose, that the said fathers 
supported Douglas’s view concerning the jurisdiction 
of Congress over slavery in the territories. Lincoln had 
applied the method of science, by tracing the record of 
these fathers in history; he cites them by name, can- 
vassing the actions of nearly a hundred persons in all, 
and marshals the results into an overwhelming refu- 
tation of Douglas’s sophistry. Lincoln, of course, did 
this with consummate skill and power; yet the process 
of his logic itself is perfectly simple and can be emulated 
by any intelligent high school student; it is just one of 
those indispensable human faculties or capacities which 
every normal individual possesses and should cultivate. 
This kind of thinking is the bedrock for all success in 
human affairs, great or small, public or private. Our 
boys and girls in school and college may well study the 
long discipline that Lincoln imposed upon himself to 
perfect and consolidate that native impulse for logical 
thinking which was so strong in him from the beginning, 
and which is bestowed in some measure upon every
-P-A-G-E-218
ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND AMERICAN EDUCATION 193 
normal child. Over and over again, from boyhood to 
middle life, he subjected himself to rigorous training to 
attain mental power. The most striking case perhaps 
is his study of geometry, even after he had been in Con- 
gress, in order to form the habit and capacity for the 
closest demonstrative reasoning. 
This is the place to speak of his humor — so much 
misunderstood. Probably no man ever loved jest and 
quip more than he did. He reveled in the comic and 
ridiculous, and yet was keenly sensitive of the subtler 
shades of the humorous, and was a master of quaint 
and pithy utterance. But never did he permit humor 
to trespass upon the ground of serious thought. When 
he was engaged in his great combat with Douglas, 
appealing to audiences of the most motley mixture, his 
friends urged him to “tell more funny stories.” He 
absolutely refused — “The occasion is too serious. The 
issues are too grave. I do not seek applause, nor to 
amuse people, but to convince them.” Would that 
many of us with less of the humorous in us than Lincoln 
might understand the stern necessity of serious thought 
on serious themes ! 
A book might well be written on the intellect of Lin- 
coln, He had an almost miraculous power of piercing 
through the shell of things into their deeper meaning. 
He stood almost always between two sets of extremists. 
Take the fugitive slave laws, for example, prescribed 
by the Constitution and demanded by the slaveholders 
as their right, but denounced and conscientiously set
-P-A-G-E-219
194. EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
at naught by great numbers of anti-slavery men. Lin- 
coln writes to a southern friend : 
T acknowledge your rights and my obligations under the constitu- 
tion in regard to your slaves. I confess I hate to see the poor 
creatures hunted down and caught and carried back to their stripes 
and unrequited toil; but I bite my lips and keep quiet. 
For this he was denounced by abolitionists as “that 
Illinois slave-hound,” even while the slavery advocates 
were reviling him as a “black republican.” 
Second, he loved right. All through his life he was 
constantly doing things that cost him dearly, in money, 
in work, in popularity, for the sole reason that he 
judged them right and anything else wrong. Over and 
over he hazarded his success, he defied the dominant 
public opinion, he rejected the counsel and appeals of 
his friends; but only in matters of right and wrong. 
There is a phrase in Nicolay and Hay’s great biogra- 
phy which might well be engraved in gold in every 
American schoolhouse. After speaking of his extraor- 
dinary scruples in his law practice, they say: “This 
inflexible, inconvenient, and fastidious morality was to 
be of vast service afterward to his country and the 
world.” Youth needs to know that morality that is 
not fastidious and inflexible is no morality at all; and 
that, being inflexible and fastidious, it is bound, wpon 
occasion, to be mighty inconvenient to its possessor and 
sometimes to others, but also of vast service in issues 
and crises when easy-going consciences prove worse 
than ropes of straw.
-P-A-G-E-220
| ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND AMERICAN EDUCATION 195 
“He stood in awe of the constitution and of his oath 
of office,” says Henry Watterson. ‘He knew no fear 
except the fear of doing wrong,” says Ingersoll. There 
are a hundred true stories to tell to children and youth 
which show how Lincoln’s conscience worked in actual 
life in matters great and small — all the way from his 
long walk after business hours to return three cents 
accidental overcharge to a customer, up to great crises 
in his political career, when he flatly refused to trim his 
words or actions to favor his own or his party’s success. 
Consider his crucial question to Douglas — in which he 
summed up the slavery problem at that moment, 1858 
— which his political advisers implored him not to ask, 
and which he insisted upon asking, believing that the 
good of the cause required it. Douglas squirmed like 
a worm on a hook and gave an evasive answer, just as 
Lincoln’s friends predicted, and Lincoln was defeated, 
partly by the question. He was bitterly disappointed 
by the defeat but quite unrepentant of his action in 
asking the perilous question. To one who asked how he 
felt about the result of the election, he replied, “Like 
the boy who stumped his toe. He was too big to cry, 
and it hurt too bad to laugh.” 
These two lessons of relentless logic and inflexible 
righteousness are at least two of the indispensable ele- 
ments in national welfare and the prosperity and prog- 
ress of mankind. There are few sources for the educa- 
tor to compare with the drama of Abraham Lincoln in 
American history.
-P-A-G-E-221
196 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
Lincoln’s loyalty to logic and to right made it im- 
possible for him to indulge in the almost universal vice 
of arguing by abuse. He could denounce falsehood, 
wrong, cruelty, when occasion called for it. He was 
slow indeed to denounce or even condemn men. He 
bore abuse beyond measure, often from those who 
should have rather given him their most glowing praise; 
but “he answered not again.” He had an extraor- 
dinary gift of thinking and speaking well of persons, or 
of being silent concerning them. He deprecated the 
term “rebels” as applied to the enemies of the Union, 
and after Appomattox would not tolerate the word in 
his hearing. 
Third, he loved humanity: not in any shadowy gen- 
eral form, but in the form of men and women and chil- 
dren. In this respect he surpasses all other rulers and 
magistrates in history; it is the simple truth to say 
that no other man in great place ever so nearly em- 
bodied in public as well as in private action the gracious 
but extreme teachings of the Sermon on the Mount. It 
is an extraordinary tribute to the people of the country 
and to our institutions that such a man could administer 
the government with such success and, even after much 
blame, win such adoration. 
One test of love of humanity is the capacity to see 
the beauty of undistinguished and lowly lives and feel 
their claims to consideration: this Lincoln had in full. 
He knew so well the common life of common men and 
women; he was never under the illusion, so popular in
-P-A-G-E-222
ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND AMERICAN EDUCATION 197 
late years, of a world made up of a few supermen and a 
vast mass of submen. He never seemed to suspect his 
own greatness, but rather was the most humble of men, 
and yet at the same time possessed of flawless dignity. 
One of the most touching and significant incidents 
of his life is his own recital of a dream he had after he 
became President. He was passing through a great 
crowd of people, and men were craning their necks to 
see him. One man, catching sight of him, muttered 
disappointedly, “He’s a common-looking fellow, after 
all.” Lincoln, still in the dream, answered: “Yes, my 
friend; but the Lord likes common people; that’s why 
he made so many of them.” 
The strongest man in the countryside, champion 
wrestler; the chief magistrate of a great nation in its 
time of bitter agony; beloved by more human beings 
than any other man in his lifetime ever was; unques- 
tioned master of the strongest men of his day; yet 
after a day spent in vast problems of war and of state, 
he came home rejoicing almost to tears because he had 
made two mothers happy, and in his own inimitable 
simplicity of style he wrote: 
“As T have passed through life I have plucked a thorn 
whenever I could and planted a rose wherever I thought 
a rose would grow.” 
Loving truth and right and humanity, he could not 
but love liberty. For liberty is the release of truth and 
right and humanity in the individual life, and the em- 
bodiment of truth and right and humanity in the social
-P-A-G-E-223
198 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
order. For us today in America, still engaged in the 
realization of the dreams of our fathers and of the best 
vision of our own times, this passion for liberty is the 
crucial point of the lesson of Lincoln. It is not strange 
that the Declaration of Independence, with its lofty 
prophecy of freedom and equality, was his political 
gospel. He said: 
I have never had a feeling, politically, that did not spring from 
the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence. I 
have often inquired of myself what great principle or idea it was 
that kept this Confederacy (prior to the adoption of the Constitu- 
tion) so long together. It was not the mere matter of separation 
of the colonies from the motherland but that sentiment in the 
Declaration of Independence which gave liberty not alone to the 
people of this country but hope to all the world for all future 
time. It was that which gave promise that in due time the weights 
should be lifted from the shoulders of all men, and that all should 
have an equal chance. 
His penetrating eye discerned the inexorable truth 
that the enslavement of any is fatal to the freedom of 
all: “In giving freedom to the slave, we assure free- 
dom to the free” ; and “this government cannot endure 
permanently, half slave and half free.” This is exactly 
where the new freedom of the modern world splits off 
from all the partial freedoms of ancient times, even the 
best of them in Athens or republican Rome. He real- 
ized, what few indeed in his day dreamed of, that slav- 
ery was as much a wrong against the slaveholder as 
against the slave; he knew that he was fighting the 
battle of American liberty and not a mere crusade to
-P-A-G-E-224
ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND AMERICAN EDUCATION 199 
rescue black men from chattel slavery. It was this 
that lifted his soul into the heights and inspired his 
utterances with prophetic insight and fervor. He saw 
the issue of the day in the figure of eternity: “Is 
slavery right or is it wrong? That is the real issue. 
That is the issue that will continue in this country when 
these poor tongues of Judge Douglas and myself shall 
be silent. It is the eternal struggle between these two 
principles — right and wrong — throughout the world. 
They are the two principles that have stood face to face 
from the beginning of time and will ever continue to 
struggle. The one is the common right of humanity, 
and the other the ‘divine right of kings.’” 
No other conspicuous figure of his day even ap- 
proached Lincoln in this far, wide vision: nearest were 
the mere unpractical idealists — Emerson the sage, 
Whittier the poet, and Theodore Parker the religious 
prophet. Jefferson had glimpsed it a half century 
earlier, when the ardor of the Revolution had not yet 
faded; speaking of slavery he said: “I tremble for my 
country when I consider that God is just, and that his 
justice cannot sleep forever.” But in spite of narrow 
views, and selfish interests, and the persistent passion 
for “peace in our time,” the deep instinct of the mass 
of common men and women in the North answered 
to his great call. Although Lincoln had disapproved 
John Brown’s raid and all other violence, still the sing- 
ers of “John Brown’s soul” knew that they were in 
accord with the soul of Lincoln too. The accord was
-P-A-G-E-225
200 EDUCATING FOR FREEDOM 
    still more perfect with the greatest hymn that aro 
from the war of emancipation—“The Battle-Hymn o: 
the Republic.” How inadequate it would have been to 
write it, “The Battle-Hymn of Negro Emancipation !” 
These are the things Lincoln did love and live by: 
truth, right, humanity, and freedom. All the cruder, 
more tangible, more “practical” ends of life beckoned 
to him as they do to all men: money, the commonest 
and most immediately practical of all, and today as 
always one of the most dangerous, never had any lure 
for him: his financial ethics seemed literally fantastic 
even to his day, and today many of our supposedly 
great must in their secret hearts look with pitying 
contempt upon his lack of “money sense.’”’ He never 
had any skill in combining the worship of God and 
Mammon! Power, ambition — “the last infirmity of 
noble minds” —these had no great appeal to this giant 
spirit in a giant frame: over and over their lure was set 
for him, bright and dazzling or subtle and evasive, but 
always in vain: he seemed to possess some Socratic 
demon which warned him and he passed safely on his 
appointed way. 
These thoughts remind us naturally of Lincoln’s 
religion, and its possible value to a country where the 
rigorous separation of church and state has banished 
all official religious instruction from the public schools, 
and must continue to do so. But there is no bar in 
constitutions or statutes against the total personality 
of Lincoln; and if he comes in truly religion will
-P-A-G-E-226
ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND AMERICAN EDUCATION 201 
come in too. He blended his religion with every part 
of his life, not even excluding politics: he made no 
important decisions, he tells us, without seeking and, 
as he believed, receiving the guidance of God; he 
spoke of religious matters with the simplicity of a 
child, and on all sorts of occasions and to all sorts of 
people. America needs religion today: but it needs 
a religion which will bind men together and make 
them love each other, which will make us sensitive to 
human needs and human freedom; whether among 
our own people or throughout the great family of 
mankind. For such a religion we may well commend 
the religion of Abraham Lincoln. 
This is the challenge of Lincoln to the twentieth 
century — perhaps to the rolling years far beyond its 
limits. It is the challenge to our own immediate times, 
for we are engaged in a new phase of the old evolving 
issue, whether few or some or even many may safely 
build their own freedom upon the oppression or limita~ 
tion of others.

APPENDIX 207 
CHAPTER I 
Wuar Is America? 
Reading list : 
1. The best reading of all is in current periodical literature, 
including the partisan and more or less distorted daily press, 
corrected by the more critical and reliable journals of less 
frequent issue, such as the Survey, the Nation, the Outlook, 
the Independent, the World’s Work, Atlantic, Century, the 
World Tomorrow, Labor Age, Journal of Social Forces, etc. 
Every American should read beyond -the range of his own 
class; most of us read what simply feeds our prejudices and 
so renders us less intelligent rather than wiser. The “middle- 
class” should read labor journals, the devotee of one religion 
or party should read the views and arguments of the opposed 
group: this is the counsel of logic and intelligence. 
2. “What Is Americanism?” — The American Journal of 
Sociology (January and April, 1915). A symposium by a large 
number of representative Americans, exhibiting a startling 
and perhaps ominous range of opinion.

and Appendix.

208 APPENDIX 
the “revolutionary fringe” by one of the ‘most distinguished 
students of American social problems. 
Problems for further study : 
1. Arrested or retarded elements in our national ideal of 
“life, liberty, and happiness” for all: unemployment, pov- 
erty, migratory labor, the 84-hour week, unsanitary and 
immoral housing conditions, ete. 
2. Political evils: indifference of citizens; inattention to 
public questions; the domination of private interest and 
partisan success. The tyranny of groups, of diverse social 
and economic character. 
3. Advance movements: labor legislation; civic organ- 
izations, especially in cities; the wave of advance in social 
instruction in schools. 
4, The revolutionary fringe of protest: I. W. W., extreme 
socialism, communism. The task of the student is to seek 
for the significance of these movements as symptoms in the 
body politic; the main run of public discussion clouds this 
issue in more or Jess distorted denunciation of the element of 
violence supposed to be involved in them. 
5. The problem of education in view of “the state of the 
Union.” Read especially the rather tantalizing but very 
stimulating and suggestive “Social Studies” by J. K. Hart, 
appearing regularly in the Survey.

(Macmillan). 
7. Parker, Caruton J. — The Casual Laborer (Harcourt,

Problems for further study : 
4. What is the human significance ‘of discontent and unrest 
among large bodies of the population, and especially in cer- 
tain strata of the social order, as, for example, farmers or 
industrial laborers? What should be the attitude of the 
people as a whole and of government and government officials 
toward this phenomenon? 
2, What is the Industrial Revolution in Europe and in 
America? How does it affect the freedom of (a) the laborer, 
(6) the small capitalist? How extensive is its influence in 
the United States? 
3. What is the problem of the migratory laborer? 
How many of them are there in the United States? 
Does industry require them in its present organization? 
What is seasonal occupation and how is it related to migra- 
tory labor?

seem to arise from the social and economic transformation 
referred to in the chapter?

and economic reorganization, in averting these dangers and 
insuring the preservation and advance of genuine American 
life and institutions?

-P-A-G-E-236
APPENDIX 211 
Problems for further study : 
1. What are the specific elements of true Americanism 
which the American school should set itself to foster and 
strengthen in its pupils? 
2. Are national welfare and endurance of national life “in 
the last analysis a question of education”? Why is educa- 
tion so momentous? 
3. Are we in any danger of forgetting ultimate aims in our 
attention to “doing what we are doing”? 
4, What forces or agencies are directly or indirectly en- 
' gaged in setting the aims of American education? We have 
forty-eight states and two territories, each practically inde- 
pendent in its educational affairs: how are we to obtain a 
national program and unity in our educational operations? 
5. Plato said, “Education is the principal business of the 
State.” Would the “Congressional Record” or the journal 
of any state legislature indicate that this is a fact in the 
United States (or any other country) today? On the other 
hand, is it more nearly realized than ever before in history, 
on the basis of actual statistics of enrollments and expendi- 
tures? 
CHAPTER IV

9. Muon, Jonny — Areopagitica. : 
To understand conflicting opinions of the present time one 
should examine the publications of such organizations as the 
American Civic Federation, the American Defense Society, 
the National Civil Liberties Union, ete. 
Problems for further study : 
1. Lincoln, at a critical time of the Civil War, raised the 
question whether “a government must needs be either too 
strong for the liberties of the people or so weak as to fall at 
the first attack.” Examine this paradox in the light of our 
own history and that of other countries. 
2. Consider the tendency of a state of war to put an end 
to the individual liberty of all concerned. 
3. What did Jesus mean by saying: “Ye shall know the 
truth and the truth shall make you free” ? 
4. What is the relation of this chapter to the one on

tution.” 
8 Demine, Seymour —A Message to the Middle Class

Problems for further study : 
1. Isit conceivable that the armed coercion exercised upon 
the seceding states in the 60’s was, in actual effect, a contri- 
bution to their liberty? 
2. What is the relation of the industrial revolution and the 
counter-movement for “industrial democracy” to the prob- 
lem of union? 
8. “In a hearty and sound democracy all questions at 
issue must be minor matters; fundamentals must have been
-P-A-G-E-239
214 APPENDIX 
silently agreed upon and taken for granted when the democ- 
racy arose” (Santayana, “Character and Opinion in the 
United States,” p. 206; New York, 1920). Consider this 
proposition in relation to (a) the adoption of the Constitution, 
(6) the slavery issue in the 60’s, and (c) the present economic 
and social conflicts. 
4. How does Miss Follett’s doctrine of the “collective 
idea” differ from mere majority rule, and how does it min- 
ister to the reconciliation of liberty and union? 
5. How may education, and particularly the public 
school, foster in the young citizen qualities of “mind and 
will which may serve in the cause of the same reconcilia- 
tion? 
6. Consider the persistent problem of freedom and union 
involved in the fact that parties are the only known mechan- 
ism for the operation of popular government and that their 
strength depends upon party loyalty. 
7. How does the logic of national unity bear upon the 
now crucial problem of world order?

9. Luxcotn’s Second Annual Message to Congress (Dec. 
1, 1862), latter half. 
10. Pitispury — Psychology of Nationality and Interna- 
tionalism (Appleton). 
Problems for further study: 
1, What excuse is there for the famous sarcasm of Samuel 
Johnson that “ patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel”? 
Might the same be said of almost any greatly admired virtue? 
2. It is rare for half of the legally qualified citizens to go 
to the polls and vote at any election, and often less than one 
tenth do so; is this a reflection upon our patriotism? 
3. Consider also the prevailing attitude of the citizen 
toward such matters as payment of taxes, respect for 
laws, and service on juries, as concrete expressions of 
patriotism. 
4. Why is patriotism easier to attain in a small country 
like Switzerland or Holland than in an immense population 
like ours? . :

APPENDIX 217 
Problems for further study : 
1. Why have the words politics, politician, political so 
bad an odor in common conversation? Is it the fault of the 
“politicians” or of all of us? 
2. Make a study of local and state elections in your own 
community, to see what proportion of people (a) register, 
and (6) vote; determine if possible by the use of precinct 
statistics how the different social groups figure in the matter. 
3. Discuss the problem of practical civic activity with 
friends, with persons themselves active in public affairs, and 
with persons of character and ability who hold aloof. 
4, Find out if possible how the burden of economic duty, 
both among the laboring class and among professional and 
business groups, hinders the performance of civic duty. 
5. Consider your own educational experience as bearing 
upon your own sense of civic duty and your fitness for it. 
6. Make a special study of the young citizens just entering 
upon active participation in publie affairs; also of newly 
naturalized foreign-born citizens. What opportunities have 
these new citizens for civic training ?

This is the most comprehensive summary of progressive 
thinking and action in this field of school instruction. The 
reader needs to maintain an attitude of keen criticism to- 
gether with an entire willingness to be instructed. 
For further references, especially on current discussions, 
see the last-named volume, Appendix I, p. 305, especially

Problems for further study : 
1. Consider to what extent the life of a people may be 
compared with the life of an individual, and consequently
-P-A-G-E-246
APPENDIX 221 
whether a people may learn from its history as an individual 
learns from his experience. 
2. Does history repeat? Can we safely apply to present 
problems ready-made solutions from the past? 
3. Herbert Spencer declared that most history as taught 
was little but gossip. Just what did he mean? Is there as 
much ground for this charge as there was in his time? 
4, What is meant by the “dry bones” of history, and how 
can they be clothed? Be sure to think in concrete and actual 
terms on this point. 
CHAPTER X 
ApranAM Lincotn anp American Epucation 
Reading list : 
1. Cuarnwoop, Lorp — Abraham Lincoln (Holt). “The 
best brief biography of Lincoln and one of the best biog- 
raphies of any American” (L. V. Roth). 
Peculiarly suited to the present purpose in that it deals 
primarily with Lincoln’s political life; naturally it thus be- 
comes both an account of the whole slavery conflict and a 
study of American political institutions. 
2, Drinkwater, Joun— Abraham Lincoln, a Play 
(Houghton Mifflin). The first and thus far the only success- 
ful dramatization of the “First American.” 
8. Nicotay anp Hay — Abraham Lincoln: a History 
(Century). The classical and authoritative record, by 
Lincoln’s two private secretaries. 
4. Tarpewn, Ina — Lefe of Abraham Lincoln (Macmillan). 
5. Tarpe., Ina — Selections from Lincoln (Ginn). Ad- 
miirable for school use.
-P-A-G-E-247
222 APPENDIX 
6. Old South Leaflets — Nos. 11, 85, 107, 189, 213, 214. 
An excellent way to study Lincoln is to read Charnwood and 
use the fuller sources, Nicolay and Hay especially, for con- 
stant reference. The most important and illuminating 
addresses and letters are found in the “Old South Leaflets” 
and Miss Tarbell’s “Selections.” 
Problems for further study : 
1. What are the lessons of Lincoln’s own education? 
‘Trace some of the lines of his definite practical training for 
the great accomplishment involved in the Cooper Union 
Speech. 
2. Study the ruling principle in Lincoln’s political philos- 
ophy: see especially his address at Independence Hall, 
Philadelphia, February 22, 1861, where he states it himself. 
3. Be sure that you understand Lincoln’s views on slavery 
_ — his own personal opinion and attitude on the one hand, and 
his constitutional view and official policy on the other. 
4. Napoleon and Lincoln were both consummate “masters 
of men”; wherein do they radically differ in this respect ? 
5. Of his plan for compensated emancipation, Lincoln said 
it was “plain, peaceful, generous, just”; that it would 
“shorten the war, and thus lessen the expenditure of money 
and of blood”; and that it would save and perpetuate the 
Union. Consider carefully the plan (see Second Annual 
Message, December 1, 1862) and the course of events from 
1861 to 1870— the War and Reconstruction — and judge 
his assertion in the light of all factors.

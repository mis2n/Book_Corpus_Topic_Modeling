Preface 
It is often difficult for little children to remember the 
words of a song. Hence,a song with two or three stanzas 
is not of practical usefulness. : 
Miss Brennan,a teacher of experience,has sought to a- 
void this difficulty by making these songs of one stanza. 
She has succeeded in making each one complete in itself 
and the text is of great variety. : 
Practical experience showed a need forthe short song 
and we hope therefore that this book may have a useful- 
hess in the Kindergarten and Primary grades.

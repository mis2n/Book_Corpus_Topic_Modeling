  INTRODUCTION. 
A.tHoucH Andros is the island nearest both to Nassau, the capital 
of the colony, and, excepting Bimini and Grand Bahama, to the Florida 
coast, it is the least visited of whites of all the more settled islands in 
the Bahama group. Its only regular means of communication with 
New, Providence or the other islands is a bi-weekly mail schooner. 
Out of its population of about seventy-five hundred, but a-dozen 
or so are white,! and of them only half are European-born. These 
men are priests or resident commissioners or sponge merchants. The 
seven schoolmasters are colored. The population is strung out in 
small groups along the east coast, a stretch of about one hundred miles, 
the chief settlements being Nicolls Town, Mastic Point, Stanyiard 
Creek, Calabash Bay, Fresh Creek, Behring Point, Mangrove Cay,? 
Long Bay Cays, Pure Gold, Kemp’s Bay. The west coast and the 
interior are uninhabited; parts of the interior are even unexplored. 
The colored as well as the white population of the island is of a 
very composite character. The bulk of the original settlers, I was 
told by Ex-Commissioner Forsyth, migrated to the island from two 
sources, — from the Mosquito coast in 1783, when the British re- 
linquished control, a mixed stock of Scotch, Indian, and Negro blood; 
and from about 1830 to 1836 from the Florida everglade region, 
Negroes with Indian blood.* The ancestors of one of the most 
prominent families on the island were Carolinians, being among the 
United Empire loyalists who migrated to the Bahamas during the 
American Revolution.4 Andros has also been a dump-heap, as it was 
put to me, for the other islands, a place of refuge for the restless, or a 
resort for the ambitious. I did, indeed, meet many who had been 
either bred or born elsewhere. 
The inhabitants of Andros are of a mixed origin and of a mobile 
1 Many Bahamans accounted white have Negro blood. Not uncommonly white 
Bahamans marry women with Negro blood. 
2 Now the chief settlement. In 1852 Nicolls Town was the chief settlement, and the 
island population was 1032. 
3 I met individuals who stated that they had Indian ancestry; but with the exception 
of two women, mother and daughter, I saw no physical suggestion of it. The Indian 
descendants are located for the most part, however, at Nicolls Town, and my stay there 
was brief. 
4 These Southern loyalists migrated also to Jamaica. They took their slaves with 
them. In comparing certain tales in the following collection with tales collected in our 
Southern States, these facts of migration should be borne in mind.

  x Introduction. 
habit, but so are, if in lesser degree, the inhabitants of the other 
islands in the group. As the islanders move about, they carry their 
“ol’ storee” with them. Hence the tales told on any island are, 
I believe, of a Bahaman rather than of a merely local character. 
The tales I collected in New Providence, the tales sent to me from 
other islands in the group, together with the tales collected by Edwards 
in Green Turtle Cay, Harbour Island, and Bimini, confirm this im- 
pression. Not, however, until we have further collections from other 
islands can this conclusion be definitely asserted. Granted a more or 
less common stock of tales, it is quite possible that variants may have 
developed, nevertheless, and become characteristic in any one island. 
It is to be hoped, therefore, that collections from the other islands 
will be made. 
The tales allow for individualistic variation, deliberate variation, 
only in their conclusion. The narrator is expected to connect the 
tale with the occasion of its telling, —an opportunity for personal 
garnish or wit. This feature in talking? “‘ol’ storee,’’ whenever 
the tale is properly told, is very marked. In addition to these ex- 
temporized endings, there are formula endings for the tales. There 
are also formula beginnings.’ To be properly “talked,” every ‘‘ol’ 
1 The migratory history of the captain of the boat in which I coasted about Andros is 
not, I surmise, unusual. Born in the Bermudas, his mother went with him, a nine- 
months-old baby, first to Turk Island, then to Abaco. He grew up in Abaco and married. 
His children died, six of them; and so he resolved to change to another island, to New 
Providence. His wife was at first set against going. They “work witch” at Nassau, 
and she was extremely fearful (to this day she will not eat any present of food her Nassau 
acquaintances — friends, mind you — may give her), but she eventually followed her 
husband. His parents also followed him. 
2 You talk ol’ storee. The emphasis is on “‘ol’.”’ If pronounced properly, “talk ol’ 
storee’’ is a formula understood by every one. Not knowing it during my first hour in 
Nassau, when I asked for old-time story-tellers, I was directed to fortune-tellers. The 
formula learned, almost anywhere I could get a group of women and children around me 
eager to talk ‘“‘ol’ storee’’ fora penny or two. This of course was only one of my methods 
of collecting, — a particularly useful method to ascertain the circulation of a story already 
heard. But the best way to hear the stories is in the evening, the time they are wont to 
be told, and, if possible, in the house of a mutual friend. On Andros Island I had quarters 
in two such hospitable and friendly houses, — at Mastic Point with Mr. P. C. Smith, the 
leading sponge merchant of the island; and at Mangrove Cay with Commissioner Clarke. 
To them and their households I am greatly indebted. Among others I am indebted like- 
wise to Acting-Commissioner Reeves, to Ex-Commissioner Forsyth and to Mr. H. B. 
Bow of Mangrove Cay, and to Mr. Bethel of Nassau. In planning for me practical 
details, the governor, Sir William Allardyce, was most helpful. 
8 Both are noted in MAFLS 3, and a formula ending is given in Pub. FLS 55. Accord+ 
ing to Heli Chatelain, every musoso (the “‘ol’ storee’’ of Angola) has these formulas o 
introduction and conclusion (MAFLS 1: 21). So have the Fjort tales (Dennett, 25, 27, 
28).— The Portuguese Negro tales I have collected among the Cape Verde Islanders in 
Massachusetts and Rhode Island have a number of set endings. The beginnings of their 
tales are almost stereotyped enough to be considered formulas; e.g., “There was a man
-P-A-G-E-11
  Introduction. xi 
storee’’ should have one of these openings and closings. They are 
very often omitted, however, sometimes from sophistication, sometimes 
from mere carelessness. There is nothing in the “‘ol’ storee’’ itself, 
I believe, to determine the inclusion or omission of the formula. 
English folk-tales have analogous formulas, and several of them are 
in use in the Bahamas. ‘Once upon a time”’ is frequently used. So 
is 
“They lived in peace, they died in peace, 
And they were buried in a pot of candle-grease.” 
Formulas less familiar to us are also of indubitable English origin. 
“E bo ben, 
Dis story en’,”’ 
and its variants, are from the English nominie 
Be bow bended, 
My story’s ended. 
The most common Bahama opening — 
“Once was a time, a wery good time, 
Monkey chew tobacco an’ spit white lime’? — 
is of the same character as openings given in collections of Scotch 
and English tales. 
“Lang Syne, when geese were swine, 
And turkeys chewed tobacco, 
And birds biggit their nests in auld men’s beards 
And mowdies [moles] del’t potawtoes.”’ 2 
Or, — 
“Once upon a time when pigs spoke rhyme 
And monkeys chewed tobacco, 
And hens took snuff to make them tough, 
And ducks went quack, quack, quack, O!’’* 
married to a woman,” or ‘“‘ There was a woman had three sons.” They have the same 
formula for story-telling as the Bahamans: Conta stori(a) belh (velha, ‘‘old”).— As a 
mere matter of convenience for reference, I have given titles to the tales, — titles sugges- 
tive of the pattern or type incident, — but it must be understood that the narrator does 
not make use of such titles. The nearest he ever comes to a title is, for example, “Dis 
was a queen daughter.” or ‘‘’Bout Boukee and b’o’ Rabby” (cf. Ellis 1: 214-215). 
1 JAFL 6: 60; 8: 155. Edwards draws attention to this nominie as an origin (MAFLS 
3: 111), although elsewhere (MAFLS 3: 64, note 3), funnily enough, he suggests an 
African origin. 
2 Chambers, 57, 395. ‘‘When Cockle Shells turned music bells’’ is another variant 
(Tbid., 8 5). Chambers suggests that.the rhyme was apropos in connection with a narrative 
beyond the bounds of the credible. This was the reason for its use advanced to me on 
Andros Island. 
8 Jacobs 1: 69, 204.
-P-A-G-E-12
  xii Introduction. 
Or, again, in the Bahamas the beginning formula may be, — 
“Once was a time, a good ol’ time, 
Not my time, not your time, ol’ people time.” 
Mr. Jacobs begins “Jack and his Golden Snuff-Box” with, “Once 
upon a time, and a very good time it was, though it was neither in my 
time nor in your time nor in any one else’s time.” ! 
The personages of the tales are also formulaic, possessed of fixed 
attributes or names. Rabbit is always temperate and crafty, Boukee 
always greedy and sluggish. In the tales of a ‘“‘boy” hero, Jack or 
Jock is almost invariably his name. Greenleaf is the name of the 
heroine. Between the animal and human tales the islanders make 
no distinction,? all are “‘ol’ storee.”’ In some of the tales Jack and 
the “‘creeturs” figure together, in other tales Rabbit plays a part 
with human beings. 
Nor have I attempted any classification of the tales according 
to the caste. Even what one might be inclined to consider the 
Rabbit-Boukee cycle of tales is not quite definite enough * in the 
minds of the narrators to merit a distinct classification. The only 
grouping I have undertaken, therefore, is historical rather than 
psychological. I have grouped together the tales for which I recognize, 
or in some cases surmise, a common provenience. Moreover, in the 
bibliographical notes on parallel tales, after giving the American and 
African references, I have suggested by the order followed what seems 
to me the most likely European provenience. Given the antecedents 
of the islanders, the choice lies among French, Scotch, English, and 
Portuguese sources. Of interest in this connection is the fact that 
during my final editing of the tales I happened to be engaged in col- 
lecting Portuguese-Negro tales from Cape Verde Islanders in Massa- 
chusetts and Rhode Island. Resemblances between the Bahama and 
the Cape Verde Islands tales, not only in patterns but in many minor 
details, I found'startling. Whatever may have been the provenience 
of the tales in Africa, Portuguese or other, I have no doubt that by 
far the greater number of the Bahama tales were learned there, — 
learned, not in America, but in Africa. Parenthetical explanatory 
words or remarks in the tales*have been inserted by me. Those in 
dialect were made by the informants. 
A word in regard to the “sings” of the tales. On Andros Island, 
1 Jacobs 1: 82; also Jacobs 1: 224; also Jacobs 2: 28. 
2 Once I heard my Bermuda-Turk-Abaco-New Providence captain refer to “Jock 
tales.” On Andros Island I never heard any similar reference or classification. Nor, 
unlike Edwards (JAFL 4: 47), did I hear the term “‘fairy-story.” 
8 It seems definite compared with the lack of any animal cycle in the tales of the 
Southern States; compared with the definiteness of such a cycle as the Cape Verde Islands 
tales of Lob and Subrinh, it seems indefinite. 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
  Introduction. xiii 
“sings” belong in or are introduced into a great many of the tales. 
In the tales written for me by Andros Islanders and others, these 
songs tend to be eliminated. The more sophisticated narrator will 
also suppress them. Pa Black of Jamaica and Andros sometimes took 
steps as he sung; so did old Jack Armbrister, one of the so-called 
“Congo’’ in New Providence.1 The phonograph records I made of 
the songs were transcribed by Mr. H. W. Loomis. 
EtsigE CLEws Parsons. 
1 Old Armbrister had taught the words and dance-steps to his grandson, John Richard- 
son. He was impatient when the bashful boy refused to perform with him, Like a 
true artist, he explained that he could not do justice to song and dance without, as he 
said, a “partner.”

I. PLAYING GODFATHER.! 
Once was a time, a very good time, 
Monkey chew tobacco an’ spit white lime. 
Once Boukee an’ Rabby went on de bay an’ pick up a kag of butter, 
an’ dey car’ed de butter home. An’ b’o’ Rabby say, “Now, b’o’ 
Boukee, we cut fiel’ togeder.”” Say, “You'll he’p me to-day, an’ I'll 
he’p you to-morrow.” So dey went to start ter cut de fiel’. Directly 
b’o’ Rabbit holler out, ‘‘Say!’’ Boukee say, ‘‘Rabby, who call you?” 
— ‘Dem people might call me. Dey can’t name chillun dey se’f. 
I ain’t goin’ noway.” B’o’ Boukee say, “‘Go ’long, ’cause only you 
here could name chillun.” Say, ‘All right, I goin’ dis time; but if 
dey call again, I ain’t goin’ no more.” He went an’ he opened de kag 
of butter, an’ he started to eat. An’ when he went back, b’o’ Boukee 
ax him, ‘What de chil’ name?’’ Say, ‘‘I gi’ him name ‘Begin um.’”’ 
Directly he holler again, ““Say!’”” — “I ain’t goin’ noway.” Boukee 
say, ‘‘No min’, you’re only one here could name chillun.” So he went; 
an’ when he come back, Boukee ax him what de chil’ name. Say, 
“Quarter um.” Rabby call out, “‘Say!’’ An’ he went an’ he come 
back. Boukee ax him what de chil’ name. Say he name him 
“Half um.’’ He sing out again, “‘Say!’”” He went; an’ when he come 
back, Boukee ax him what de chil’ name. Tell him, ‘En’ um.” ? 
So Rabby eat up de kag, fill up wi’ dirt, smear a little bit of butter 
back where it been. After dey work, Boukee want taste of dat butter 
bad. Say, ‘‘Rabby, let’s open dat butter fe get some fer de dinner.’ 
So when he open de butter, Boukee started to dip, was only dirt in de 
kag. So Rabby says to Boukee, says, ‘‘You eat dat butter.” So 
Boukee says, ‘‘No, you lef’ me in de fiel’ all day.” Says, ‘It’s you.” 
Say, ‘All right, to prove it let me lie down in de sun; an’ de one you 
see de butter melt out, dat’s de one eat de butter.”” So Rabby went 
an’ lay down, an’ Boukee fell asleep. An’ b’o’ Rabby git up and grease

Sib of Andros. Ol’ Sib got tales from his father, an immigrant to Andros from Florida 
during the Civil War. This tale is very generally known on Andros. I have variants 
also from Watlings Island and from Eleuthra. Compare French Guiana, Brueyre, XI;

I.2 
Once there was two man name b’o’ Boukee an’ b’o’ Rabby. Now, 
this day b’o’ Boukee came to b’o’ Rabby house, and meet him eating 
bird-egg. So he said, ‘‘Where you get egg?” So he said, “I'll 
carry you there to-morrow.’’ So b’o’ Boukee get up early in the 
morning and make a large fire in the east. And he went up in the 
tree and crow like fowl for b’o’ Rabby to get up. So he went to 
Rabby house and wake him up, saying, ‘“‘Get up, sun rise!” And 
when b’o’ Rabby get up, he saw this big fire. He said, “‘That look 
like fire, that is not the sun.”” So b’o’ Boukee said, ‘‘Come, man, let 
us go now, sun rise!’”? And they went; and b’o’ Boukee was so 
greedy, he carried six basket and six trunks to fill with egg. So b’o’ 
Rabby left him. He said, “‘When you want to come, you must say, 
‘Low water, low.’”” He said, ‘All right!” So b’o’ Rabby went. 
Now, b’o’ Boukee stand till he fill the basket; and when he want to 
come, he say, ‘‘Flow water, flow!” and the water come higher and 
higher. And he saw b’o’ Shark passing, and he said, ‘‘Do,‘ b’o’ 
Shark, carry me across!’ And the shark said, ‘Jump on my back.” 
And when the shark get most ’shore, he said, “This shark going 
too; when I get ’shore,I going to eat him.’’ So the shark say, 
“What you say?” And he carry him right back. And he saw b’o’ 
Whale. And he said, ‘Do, b’o’ Whale, carry me across!” And 
b’o’ Whale carry him across, and he pull up the whale and cut him up 
and eat him.®

Once Rabby went an’ he fin’ a tree with honey init. Ev’ry mornin’ 
he have honey to drink with. B’o’ Boukee always sen’ de boy over 
to b’o’ Rabby for a little bit of fire, an’ b’o’ Rabby always give de 
boy honey in de mornin’. So b’o’ Boukee say, “Boy, where you get 
de honey?” An’ boy say, ‘‘B’o’ Rabbit give me some.” So b’o’ 
Boukee went over to b’o’ Rabbit an’ say, ‘‘B’o’ Rabby, were you get 
honey?” Say, “I know where dere a tree full of honey.’ Say,

“Well, care [carry] me dere.”’ Say, “I'll care you dere to-morrer.” 
Boukee gone, gather up all de casses (cases) he could to go for honey. 
So b’o’ Rabbit say, “‘Where you goin’ with all dem t’ings?” B’o’ 
Boukee says, “I want plenty honey.” — ‘‘Min’,” he says, ‘can’t 
be there too long ’cause b’o’ Long-Tus’ an’ b’o’ Johnny-Bear will kill 
you.” So de nex’ mornin’ b’o’ Rabby an’ b’o’ Boukee went. When 
dey got dere, dey say, — 
“Timmy fee, 
Timmy fin.” 
An’ de tree bruk open. B’o’ Rabbit take a bucket an’ he dip 
out his bucket full. An’ b’o’ Boukee shove he head, an’ de tree close 
on his neck. B’o’ Boukee look up. Long-Tus’ an’ b’o’ Bear be 
a-comin’, An’ when he put hishan’ up an’ shove dat tree, he peeled 
his skin right off. An’ when he get home, his chillun look up, he 
say, ‘‘Pa has a raw head.” An’ he say to them, ‘‘Why you don’ say, 
‘A raw head an’ a bloody bone.’’”? An’ when de chil’ ran feel his head, 
he slap him, an’ de chil’ darted, an’ I flash him an’ cause me to be 
here to tell you dat story. 
Il.? (Mock Sunrise.) 
Once upon a time, was a very good time, 
When monkey chew tobacco and spit white lime. 
Boukee once sent a little boy to Rabby for a piece of fire. 
When the boy went, Rabby was eating some honey. Rabby 
gave the boy some of the honey. Anyhow, the boy went 
home to Boukee licking his fingers. When Boukee saw the boy 
licking his fingers, Boukee said, ‘What’s that you eating?” He 
went to lick the boy’s fingers, and the fire burnt him on his tongue. 
Boukee started to cry. He darted at the boy. He say, “‘I going to 
kill you now, you gone burn my tongue.’’ Anyhow, the boy got 
away from him. After Boukee’s tongue was cool, he say, ‘I going to 
Rabby for some o’ this honey.” When he went, Rabby he asked 
him what he was hollowing for. Boukee say, “I was sitting down and 
the boy bu’n me on me tongue.” Rabby say, ‘You want go with 
me in the morning for some?’’ Boukee say, “Yes, man.” Anyhow, 
Boukee went home. Before seven o’clock that night Boukee came to 
Rabby. He say, “Rabby, O Rabby! he time to go.” Rabby say, 
‘Where you going to-night?’”’ Boukee gone home. About two hours 
after that, Boukee gone way up on one high hill and made a big fire up 
1 The idea seems to be that Boukee, too greedy to carry the honey away, started to 
eat it at once. The incident of forgetting the formula to open has dropped out (cf. 
Jamaica, Pub. FLS 55: XXXIX). For comparative material see Dahnhardt, 4: 232; 
Bolte u. Polivka, 2: 109; K. Krohn, Bar (Wolf) und Fuchs (Journal de la Société Finno- 
Ougrienne, 6 : 45); also Thompson Indians (Teit, JAFL 29 : 327).

in the east and gone in one tree and started to crow, “Co-coo-roo-co!”” 
He gone to Rabby. He say, ‘‘Rabby man, you sleep late, look, sun 
tise high.” Rabby say, “‘Boukee, you ain’ shame to be so greedy? 
You gone make that fire up there; man can’ sleep for you. For God 
sake, go home!’”’ Boukee say, “‘No man, fowl crew.” Rabby say, 
“Go home, man, jes’ tu’ning fowl all over the land. Go home, go 
sleep.” Rabby say, “If you come to me befo’ daylight again, I 
send my dog at you.” Anyhow, when daylight, Rabby say, ‘‘ Boukee, 
come, let’s go!’”” Boukee brought a big kit. Rabby said to Boukee, 
“Mind when you and me go, he is one lake we got a cross. When 
you go, we got a say ‘Fall, tide!’ and the water will fall. When we 
go to the hive, we mus’ wait until the King and Queen come out.” 
Anyhow, they went; and when the King and Queen come out, Rabby 
gone in and Boukee came after.. Rabby and Boukee done full up 
all they had. Rabby say, ‘‘Come, Boukee, mind when the bees come 
they going sting you to death. I going.’ Boukee say, ‘‘Man, only 
one little piece mo’.”” When he came to the mouth of the hive, he 
turned back. ‘I want ’nother little piece.’? When he went again, 
the bees came. The King stung him first, and then the Queen. 
Boukee started to hollow, ‘‘Rabby man, come here! Rabby, Rabby, 
come! I dying. O Rabby! they stinging me on my hip! Oh, 
come, Rabby!’’ Boukee had to drop his honey and come a-running, 
hollowing for Rabby, but Rabby was home. Anyhow, he came to the 
lake. When he got there, instead of he saying, ‘‘Fall, tide, fall!” 
he was so frightened that he said, ‘‘Flow, tide, flow!’’ The more he 
say ‘Flow, tide!”’ the deeper he sink, until Boukee disappeared. And 
that was the last of greedy Boukee.

Once was a time, was a wery good time,

It was a very starvation. Rabbit had plenty chillun. So de wife 
said ter Rabbit, ‘‘Why don’t you go an’ look for food? Now you can’t 
give your chillun not’in’ to eat.” ’Fo’ day dat mornin’ Rabbit went 
out in de woods. He went about seven miles from his home, an’ he 
got to a town. Dere were plenty food in dat town. Dere was a 
heavy iron gate surroun’ dat town. He said ‘Come an’ antee!”

*bout four o'clock inter de town. So when he got to de gate, he said,

Once was a time and a good old time. 
This was a man had three son, — one name Tom and the other 
name Dick, one name Jack. His father ask them what trade they 
want. Tom say he want a shoemaker. He said, ‘‘Go.” Dick said 
he want to be a minister. He said, ‘Go.’ Jack said he wanted to 
be a tief. He said that’s what he want. He gave Jack ten dollar 
to go in the market to buy a half of cow. Jack went in the market 
and call for the half of cow. W/'iles’ the man was cutting the cow, slip 
round to counter and took out ten dollars and mark ten on it and put 
it back. And mark ten on his one and put it back in his pocket and 
took the meat and start. The man call him back and ask him for 
the money. Jack said, ‘‘Man, I pay you.” He said, ‘‘ No, you ain’t 
pay me.” Jack start to cry, and said he going home to tell his father. 
He said he is going to put Jack in jail. Jack said, ‘I had twenty 
dollars all mark ten, and if I ain’t got all, you get your ten.’”’ And 
he said, “If I got any in here mark ten, you pay me.’’ And when 
he look, he find the ten dollars; and Jack said, “If you don’t pay, 
I will report you.” And man get scared and pay Jack one hundred 
poun’. And Jack carry it home. And his father told the king that 
he got a boy will t’ief his life. And next day he buy one pair of gold 
slippers and send out Jack. One man was passing with a cart full 
of money. Jack put one the slipper in the road and hid. The man

said he goin’ back for the other one. When he was out of sight, Jack 
run and take all the things and carried it home to his father. The 
king send for Jack, and told him if he could t’ief this pound-cake off 
this table, he will let him reign king. The king put man to the 
gate to look when Jack coming in. Jack put on short pan’s and took 
a apple in his hand and went. When he reach, he said, ‘“‘Good- 
evening, sir!’ Those mens said, “‘Good-evening! What is your 
errand?” He said, “I come to bring this apple for the king.” They 
didn’t know that was Jack that night, because he had on a short 
pan’s. They come in, and Jack went in and went to the kitchen and 
tol’ the cook that the king send this apple to put on the table where 
the pound-cake is. He said, ‘‘Make fast before Jack come.” She 
said, ‘‘I am doing something now.” Jack said, “Let me run and put 
it there.”” She send Jack, and Jack steal the pound-cake that same 
time. The next morning Jack bring the cake to the king. He said, 
“That’s good, Jack.” He said he got one more for Jack to t’ief. 
He said, ‘‘If you could get my wife ring off his [her] finger, you could 
reign king.”” One man just die the same night. Jack went to work 
and dig the man up, and get a ladder and put him on it, and carried 
it and put it to the window. And he pull the dead man upstairs. 
And the king said, ‘‘My wife, see Jack coming up there now!”” And 
he shot the dead man for Jack. And when he shot him, pull him 
down and pull off the rope, and move the ladder, before the king come 
out and come round the other side and went in and whispered to the 
door, and said, ‘‘My wife, out the lamp and give me the white sheet 
and the ring. Let me go and bury Jack.’’ She gave Jack. She 
think that was her husband. And Jack run out. When her husband 
come in, she said, “Give me the ring now.”’ He said, ‘‘ Which ring?” 
She said, ‘‘The ring you ask me for.” He said, “Well, be damn if 
that ain’t be Jack.” The next morning Jack come and bring the ring, 
and said he come for the king chair. The king come out, and Jack

1 In another version the tar baby was set up because Boukee had ‘‘done dirtiness in de 
well.” In my North Carolina variant, Rabbit muddies the well by washing his face. 
In the variant given in MAFLS 3 and in a variant I have from Watling’s, in the Louisiana 
and Georgia tales, and in the Fjort tale, the theft is of water from the well. Mainly the 
tar baby is a trap against the thief. With the reference to it as an obeah baby in mind, 
together with the actual practice in the islands of “‘fixin’” or ‘“‘dressin’”’ fields against 
thieves, it seems clear the tar baby has been thought of as a charm against thieves or 
trespassers. — In the Angola tale the gum baby is indeed the ‘‘medicine’’ supplied by the 
“old one”’ to catch the thieves. In the Cape Verde Islands and the Sierra Leone tales 
it is also the saibo or the ‘‘country-fashion-man” who gives directions for setting up the 
tar figure or barrel or the wax girl.—In the Bahamas there are several thief-catching 
methods. A liquid-tight mahogany box containing a fresh conch, some grave-soil, and a 
threepence, may be buried in the field. Sometimes salt water taken at flood-tide, some- 
times a species of lily (cf., for Jamaica, FL 15 : 455), is buried, always I believe with the 
grave-soil and the coin, the idea being that the spirit is thereby hired to work against the 
thief. Either the thief will be held fast in the field until the owner finds him, or, if he 
eats the produce, he will swell up, and, unless he confesses and begs the owner to remove 
the charm, he will burst (cf. Pub. FLS 55: XVI). For the use of a boxand of salt water in 
the Windward Islands see FL 26 : 262; also, for the practice of hiring spirits in the 
Leeward Islands, FL 26: 272). — Hiring spirits is a widespread Bahaman practice. Cf. 
MAEFLS 1: 260, n. 97. A sponger will fasten a threepence to his boat fore and aft to 
insure a spirit working for him. ‘“‘Sperit mus’ work fe yer. You pay ’em.” A piece of 
a human leg-bone wrapped in red flannel (cf. FL 26 : 263) — “put him forwa’ in de high"’ 
—also makes a boat. sail fast. A spirit may be hired to work against one you are ‘‘be- 
grudgin’.”” Preliminary to “‘puttin’ ghos’ on’”’ somebody, a coin is left on the grave of 
your spirit employee. A spirit may similarly be employed to cure physical ailments. — 
Swelling up appears to be the regular punishment for thieving of any kind. I was told 
of a.man who had stolen some clothes from a boat. The obeah man gave the robbed 
man some “‘juju’’ to burn, making ‘“‘a little black smoke” on his boat at five o’clock that 
afternoon. He was instructed to absent himself the next day at the same hour. The 
next day the thief, having swollen up meanwhile, returned the clothes. Compare the 
Jamaican way of finding out a thief by “a curious kind of smoke, which, when it rises, 
goes to the house of the thief’ (FL 15:93). The native use of the word juju is also of 
interest, perhaps disproving Udal’s theory that the word had not left the mainland of 
West Africa (FL 26 : 256).

There was once a man name Be-Rabbie, and another name Be-Fox.? 
They use to go in a man field and steal all his things out. Now, this 
man set a tar baby there to catch these thief. Now, when these chap 
saw this tar girl, Be-Rabbie went to this tar girl. He said, ‘Oh, 
look, this pretty girl! oh, my! let me kiss her.” And when he kiss 
her, his mouth stick; and when his mouth stick, he do all kind of 
things to get his mouth off. Then he said, “My father say anybody 
hold me, I must strike them.”” And when he struck, his hands stick. 
And he said, “I bet I kick you.’”’ And his foot stick. And he said, 
“T bet I butt you.’ And his forehead stick. And when the owner 
of the place came, he said, ‘‘This is the fellow that has been doing the 
stealing.” And he took him off. And they all made up a large fire.° 
And there was a large piece of prickle. And they asked him which 
one he would go into. And he said, ‘Don’t put me in the prickle, 
else I will die.” And they say, ‘‘ You don’t want to go in the prickle,

Monkey chew tobacco and spit white lime. 
One day Mr. Unfair married a wife. Mrs. Unfair had a daughter, 
and Mr. Unfair had a daughter by his first wife. The two step- 
sisters couldn’t agree. Mrs. Unfair would always look out for her 
daughter, but never care for Mr. Unfair’s daughter. Fathers, you 
know, is very deceitful at times with their wives, they take bribes too. 
This day Mr. Unfair’s daughter say, ‘‘My poor mother is dead, and 
Dad don’t care if I dies.” So she ask her step-mother for a loaf of 
bread, and told her she was going to look for better step-mother. 
“T nothing to do with you, go, you go, I am only to see with my child.” 
She gave her the loaf of bread and a bottle of water. The poor girl 
went. She travelled all day, all night. The next day evening her 
bread and water was out and she was hungry; and she begin to cry, 
but still going, praying to God to help her. Just at the time she came 
out to a river, and she met an old woman with her own head in her lap 
looking it. When the old woman saw her, she made haste put her 
head back on her shoulders. The old woman say, ‘‘Me daughter, 
way you gwine?’”’ The girl say, “I gwine ter look for my fortune, 
ma’am.” Old woman, “You see what I bin a-do,’’— ‘No, ma’am,” 
said the girl. ‘Come then, chil’, come catch some lice for ma.” — 
“Allright, ma’am.”’ She look the old woman head and caught plenty 
lice. The old woman say, ‘‘T’ankie, chil’, God bless you! Good 
before you, bad behind you. Chil’, you see dar house yonder? Take 
dis key, open the door. You gwine see some eggs. Dem you hear 
saying, ‘Take me,’ don’t take them, take dem va say, ‘Don’t take me.’ ? 
And you gwine see one ol’ cat. Don’t drive um.” — ‘All right, 
ma’am.” She went and did as she was told, and started on her 
journey. As she was going, one of the eggs break, and she found herself 
in a greatly altered position, with plenty company and horses and 
carts and servants and drays load of foodstuff. The next egg break. 
There were houses and gardens and all kinds of convenient, and last 
of all she got a beautiful-looking husband. The news reach to this 
poor girl’s home that she was such a fine lady and had all her wants 
supplied. The step-sister said, “‘I going to seek my fortune. If she 
can get such fortune, why can’t I get mine too?’’ She say, ‘‘Mother, 
give me some food and water, I am going.” Mother say, ‘‘Yes, my 
dear, go! I will put some cakes and wine in a basket for you.’’ She 
started, travelled all that day and that night. Next.day she came 
toariver. She saw an old woman with her head in her lap looking it.

others say, ‘‘Don’t take me!’’ and they were ugly. She say, “What 
I going to do with you ugly eggs?”” She took the pretty ones. She

living.” His mother said, “‘Son, if you go, you will never come back.”’ 
He said, “Yes, mother, when I find a living, I shall come home again.” 
So his mother said, ‘‘Go, my son, and I wish you good luck.” She 
gave him a bottle of water and a loaf of bread, and told him to be 
mannerly to everybody he meet with. And so he went. As he was 
going through the wilderness, he met a very old woman. She had 
worms dropping from her lips. She said, ‘‘My son, where are you 
going?”’ He said, ‘‘I am going to look for my. living.”” She ask him, 
if he had any bread, to give her a piece, as she was very hungry. He 
said, “Yes, ma’am.’’ And took down his bag, got out the loaf of 
bread, and handed it to her, saying, ‘“‘Eat as much as you want.” 
The old woman said, “Son, look my mouth, I can’t bite your bread, 
you must break it.’’ He said, “Oh, no, ma’am! you must bite and 
eat.” So she bite and eat; and as she bite, the worms left on the 
bread. The boy never stand to take them off, but he also bite and eat. 
When she was finish, she ask him for water; so he hand her the bottle 
with the water, and she drink. When she remove the bottle from 
her mouth, the bottle-mouth was stopped up with worms. He put 
the bottle to his mouth and drink, just as if there was no worms in the 
bottle’s mouth. After this he said to her, ‘‘I must pursue my journey.” 
So she said to him, “Go on, my son, good before you, bad behind.” 
He went and went for many a day, till he came to a little old shaggy 
house in the wilderness, and one old woman was living in the house. 
When he came to the house, he said, ‘‘Good-evening, mother!’’ She 
said, ‘“Good-evening, son! and where are you going?’’ He said, 
“To look for a living, ma’am. Please, ma’am, let me rest here till 
in the morning.” She said, “Yes, my son.”” So when it was bed-time, 
she show him a little room to go in. He went to bed; and through 
the night centipedes crawl over him, scorpion sting him, snake wrap 
round his feet, bugs and flea bite him. In the morning she said to 
him, “How you rest last night?’’ — Oh,” he said, “very good, 
ma’am. I sleep like a king.” She said, “‘That’s good. Now, my 
son, I want you to go yonder to the field and bring me three pumpkins. 
When you get in the field, you will hear the pumpkin say, ‘Pick me, 
pick me, pick me!’ but don’t pick any what say ‘Pick me.’” He 
went to the field; and when he got in the field, the pumpkin that said 
“Pick me” he did not pick, but the pumpkin that did not say any- 
thing he pick three of them and brought them to the old woman. The 
old woman said, “Son, your breakfast is on the table. I am going out 
somewhere, but I will soon be back. If you see an old cat come here 
and beg you, you must beat it away, and don’t give it any of your 
breakfast.” He said, ‘All right, ma’am.’”’ No sooner than she was

gone, the cat came in with his eyes full of biby (?) and his teeth 
grinning on one side with the foam to its mouth and as stink as a dead 
dog. The cat beg the boy, and the boy gave it some breakfast. 
Just as he got through, the cat went, and the old woman came. She 
said, “So the cat been here?”” He said, ‘Yes, ma’am, and I give it 
some food.’ She said, ‘All right, son.’’ Now, he said, ‘I must be 
pursuing my journey.” She said, ‘“‘Take those three pumpkin with 
you; and if you meet with any danger, throw down this one; and 
when you get so far, thrown down the other one; and when you get so 
far, throw down the last one.’’ So the boy took the pumpkin and 
leave. He was not gone very far before he heard a lion roar, coming 
to eat him; so he throw down one, and there was a fine rifle all ready 
loaded. So he shot the lion. Before long he missed his way and was 
lost; so he throw down the second one, and there was a nice clean road 
which lead him to one of the finest mansion ever was seen, only no one 
was in it. So he walk through it, and he remember the old woman 
said he must throw down the third one. So he threw down the third 
one, and there was the finest maid that was ever seen, and a gentleman 
well dress(ed), and lots of other maids which seem to have been her 
guests. So he married to the fair maid, as the well-dress gentleman 
was a parson. And they were keeping the wedding, and the perfume 
from them was so great that it knock me here to tell this story.

Once upon a time there was a certain young man who was very 
fond of young ladies, but he never could find any to please him. So 
one day an old lady told him not to be so long eye, unless he may one 
day marry a cat or a bird. This woman was a wizard, so she place 
herself in a young-girl style and please the young man very well. So 
they get married. This young man had a son who use to work with 
him. He was a carpenter. Every morning he wait at home for his 
father breakfast. One morning he staid behind in the house. He heard 
strange talking and singing. His father wife begin to say and sing, —

1 The same fate befell the woman who was described to me as having the habit of 
leaving her skin or skins. She would pile them in the corner before she went out into the 
night. This time ‘“‘more’n all" her husband “played asleep” and filled the skins with salt 
and pepper. So on her return she could not get into them. “’Kinny, ’Kinny, don’ you 
know me?” she cried out. These identical words were used by North Carolina informants 
in describing the same practice. They are quoted, too, from a Georgia informant (JAFL 
12:110-111). For the treatment with pepper compare also Fjort, Dennett 15. See, too, 
for the belief in the Leeward Islands in ‘‘vampire-women’”’ (i.e., women who divest 
themselves of their skins at night), FL 26 : 281. — On Andros Island men as well as women 
can leave their skins. One old man in Nicolls Town was said to have been held a prisoner 
out of his skin two days. He told his wife he had been absent from the settlement. This 
same man confessed before he died that he had ‘‘higed” a certain child who had been 
sickly. — One man told me that he had heard from his sister who had been in San Domingo 
that there “if you have a fine baby, befo’ you know the baby dead.” It has been done to 
death by “‘lazaroons,”’ the name of the witch-people who fly out of their skins in San 
Domingo. “If there are witches anywhere, they ought to be there,”” my informant 
added. — Is ‘‘lazaroon”’ to be derived from “‘loogaroo"’ (loupgarou), the Grenada term 
for the witch who leaves her skin? (Bell, 167.);— The imputation of magic power to the 
stranger, to persons in remote places, is a very striking feature of obeah in the Bahamas. 
The Andros Islander will go, not to Mangrove Cay, well known as it is for obeah practice, 
but to Nassau, or even to Hayti. A woman I knew had been most reluctant to follow her 
husband from Abaco to New Providence because of the witches there.

boy goes and tell his father that his wife is a pigeon. His father flog 
him almost to death, but the boy told him again. So he lay wait one

“Cordun, cordun, been here, 
Oh, cordun, cordun, been here! 
Oh, I never eat victual that cook out the pot, 
I feed on the berries plum that grow on the tree.”’ 
His wife begin to say, ‘‘O dear husband! don’t play that sing.” Shortly 
the house came full of pigeon all crying, ‘‘Cuttle, cuttle!” His wife 
also turn to a large pigeon. So he shoot every one; but when he get 
to the one that was his wife, she turn into the same old woman who 
he meet some days before, and said to him, “I told you that you will 
marry a cat or bird, and so you did. You fine man marry to a

soles up, has the same effect. Marking ‘“‘ten” on a grave helps to keep down the ‘“‘huygs.”” 
An iron bolt is also driven into the soil. Hyacinth bean (Dolichos Lablab L.) is planted on 
a grave for a like purpose. As soon as it has spread well over the grave, the ‘“‘huyg”’ 
cannot get out (cf. Jamaica, FL 15: 208). If the deceased is believed to have been 
poisoned, a knife and fork are placed in the coffin, — instruments with which to “huyg’”’ 
the poisoner. For the pronunciation of ‘“‘huyg’’—the word is “hag” mispronounced 
—see Jamaica, Pub. FLS 55 : 30 (notes). Jekyll appears to ignore the fact that the word 
is generic, meaning “‘a hurtful spirit.’ Perhaps the word is not in as common use in 
Jamaica as in the Bahamas.

To distract “‘ speerits” or ‘‘ hants,’’ the Andros Islander will pour out a quart or two of 
guinea-corn about the house-door or inside the haunted room. The spirit must pick up 
the corn grain by grain. This device is also in use in the other islands. The pouring-out 
of “benny,”’ a grain much finer than corn, was also recommended. Compare the analogous 
Jamaican practice. There the belief seems to be that the spirit will try to count the grains 
or pebbles, but cannot count beyond three (FL 15: 214). In Grenada there is a like belief 
and practice (Bell, 167); likewise in the Southern States (see North Carolina, JAFL 30: 
168). See Angola, MAFLS 1 : 99-101.

pulpit wi’ de Bible in my han’.”” Now, when de debil reach, he heard

1 It is a Bahaman belief that snakes and black cats (the cat must be spotless) ‘‘work 
witch”’ for people (cf. Georgia, JAFL 12: 268). If the creature is killed, its owner dies. I 
heard the story of a witch snake which swam from Abaco to the Grand Bahama, a distance 
of sixteen miles or so. On the Grand Bahama it was killed, the killer taking from it some 
coins fastened about its neck. With them he bought some tobacco. Soon afterwards he 
died. The owner of the snake also died. Compare North Carolina, JAFL 30 : 168 (No. 28). 
— In the Bahamas I found several miscellaneous cat and snake beliefs. There is a belief 
that if a black cat (or a pot) is thrown overboard, it will bring a storm. One man who was 
being ‘‘higed’’ was told to cut off the head of the first snake he met and let the body twist 
around the ankle of the leg in pain. He thereby got ‘“‘de heat of de snake an’ streng’. 
Snake wery smart.’ The skin of a snake killed on Friday put around your waist is a 
cure for pain in your body. — My Abaco-New Providence captain was once walking 
with a friend when they came across a snake. The friend killed it, took out what he 
said was its heart, and ate it. Nothing now could harm him. People might put poison 
in his food, and he would merely vomit it. The man had been in a perturbed state of mind 
because he had been working ‘‘witch” against an enemy.

“T drink, mer wife drink, an’ de horse drink.’’ Den de debil say, 
“Drink, mer horse, drink.” So he drink, an’ de horse drink. De 
horse drink tell he bus’ right open, but de river was dry. So de 
debil start after dem agen. Den Greenleaf say, “Jack, while I was 
in our country you could depend on me, but now I got ter ’pen’ on

an’ Jack get up in de pulpit, an’, when he look, see de debil comin’ 
hoppin’, one good foot an’ one bad foot. Den Jack start to preach, 
an’ say, “‘Oh, you ol’ Satan! where you gwine instead er yer tu’ning 
back an’ praying you gwine all about tro and fro de earth.” Den 
when de debil hear de preachin’, he tu’n back, an’ say, “I got one good

Den Jack an’ Greenleaf went to Jack home and stay, till one day 
Greenleaf say, ‘‘I want ter go home ter see mer people.’’ But she say

older people a positive refusal, to “talk ol’ storee’”’ on Sunday. ‘Gawd would put charge 
on’em.” There is a very decided preference on the part of the elders to “‘talk ol’ storee” 
at night rather than in the daytime; but I found no belief in connection with this preference 
—a preference readily explained on the ground of habit. There is a belief, however, that 
“talkin’ ol’ storee” will bring a favorable calm. ‘‘Come, boys, let’s talk ol’ storees 
to-night!”’ a sponger will say, ‘‘we’ll get a calm to-morrow.”

Rabby came out one mornin’. He said, “I’ll get a boat an’ I'll 
go fishin’.’”’ So he got de boat an’ he went fishin’. When he got 
out to de edge of de ocean, he met a whale. He said, “Big man,” 
he said, “what you doin’ here?” He said, “I didn’ know a big man 
like you lived along de edge.” He said, “‘I thought you live out in de

in a generation can’t get me on de beach.” He said, “True, but you 
ain’t strong as me.” He said, “All right, you want to have a bet?” 
He said, “Yes.” He said, “All right, what you goin’ to bet?’”” Whale 
said, “Bet you all de riches in my head.” Rabby say, “I bet you 
all de riches in my feet.” * He said, “All right.” De rabbit went 
asho’. He got a chain-hook an’ a chain. He went out in de boat. 
He said, “Now, Whale,” he said, “I come. Hook dis hook in yer 
jaw.”’ De whale say, “No, I’m sure it will hu’t me.’’ Rabby say, 
“No, it won’ hu’t you.” Say, “‘Le’ me hook it.” Say, “I sure to 
put it where it won’ hu’t you.’’ Whale say, “All right.” Rabby 
took de hook an’ he hook it in de whale jaw. It hurt him,. but he 
couldn’t get it out. Rabbit say, ‘Now pull for you’se’f.” Say, 
“T’m goin’ to pull for myse’f.” B’o’ Rabbit wasn’t doin’ anything,

1 For this “pointing” incident compare Bahamas, MAFLS 3 : 64; Georgia, JAFL 25: 
129; Hausa, Rattray, 2: 82-86. I note that in the Louisiana tale the incident is conclu- 
sive, as in my tale and in the Cape Verde Islands tale, of the tug of war. See, too, 
MAFLS 2: 111, where the “pointing’’ is referred to as making the sign of the cross. 
The explicit reason for Rabbit making the sign of the cross on Elephant, as given in the 
Louisiana tale and in the African tales, appears to have dropped out of the Bahama tale. 
In the former tales the pursuer is to be scared from taking vengeance.

is our best shipping-pease, and Rabby is destroying all the pease. 
Mas’ Tom say, “I never sent him. Anyhow, when he come again, 
fasten him good, and I will put him to death.” Next morning here 
comes Rabby again, whistling his little tone. So Mas’ Sam had his 
rope prepared. for Rabby, and had him lashed up. Rabby say, “Ah, 
Mas’ Sam! you tie me harder than you tied me yesterday.” Mas’ 
Sam say, “That’s all right.” Rabby eat, eat, he put in his bag, he 
eat, he put in his bag. Torectly Rabby cry, “O, Mas’ Sam! I got 
pain in my belly.”” Mas’ Sam say, “‘I can’t let you go until six o’clock, 
because that is rule.” When six o’clock, Mas’ Sam took his horse 
and went. Rabby cry, ‘‘O Mas’ Sam! six o’clock, you ain’t let me 
go this evening!”” Mas’ Sam say, “Stand there until I come. I 
going give you cocoa-pease to-morrow, anyhow.” He dried up his 
tears, and he eat, and he put in his bag through the night. Rabby 
hollo, ““Oh, oh! they got me here to marry king daughter, and she is 
too rich for my blood.” Here comes Mr. B’o’ Elephant. He say, 
“Rabby, what is the matter?’”’ Rabby say, ‘Man, they got me here 
to marry king daughter, and it is too rich for my blood.” Elephant 
say, ‘Let me lose you and tie me. After Rabby tied Elephant, he 
gone up in a big tree. Rabby saw all those wagons full of boilers to 
scald Rabby to death. When they got there, they said, “This is a 
bigger man than Rabby. This is b’o’ Elephant.” Elephant say, 
“Where is king daughter what I going married? They going cook 
plenty.”’ They got all those boilers real hot, and they scal’ed poor 
Elephant. He said, “I am put here to marry king daughter.” 
Elephant kicked until he broke away, and he ran right under the 
tree where Rabby was. When he got under, he say, ‘‘Wherever 
I find Rabby, grass never grow.” Rabby say, ‘‘What’s that you say?” 
Rabby hollo, ‘‘See the man here what you scal’ed?”” He gone to the 
westward; cut him off. ‘Look out now, get ready!’’ He turned 
back. So Elephant ran hisself to death, and Rabby still got clear.

crew.

in the best clothes, but no other property is put in the grave. On Andros Island a bowl 
of food is placed for the deceased in the darkest part of the garden. The following morning 
the contents are sure to have disappeared, the ghost has taken it. On Andros Island like-

reaches home, the child is born, and the mother gives the peacock a five-dollar gold-piece. 
“Whenever you meet a peacock, he got one roun’ gol’ right to de tail” (Andros). In the

cows. Rabbit caught one of the biggest and fattest cow, but this time 
the cow was not so tame. Rabbit coax it to come along, but it would 
not. Suddenly a lion jump out of the cow and make towards Bul 
Rabbit. Away goes Rabbit fast as he can, and the lion running 
behind him. As he get near at home, he couldn’t wait until he get 
to tell what happen, so he sing out in a loud voice, “Wife and chillen, 
get up in the t’atch, for lion coming, lion coming!”’ When he get 
home, he sprang for the roof. All his family was there. Shortly 
they all get tired, so they fall down one by one till all was gone, and 
leave him alone. Lion and ten tiger still remain in the house waiting, 
till he fall. Rabbit said to himself, “ Now I will have to out-scheme 
these people.” So he begin saying to the lion and tiger, “I can kill 
one hundred men, what you think of ten? Man fat on his beard, 
what you think of his belly?”’ Lion and tiger listen, and say to them- 
self, “If this man can kill one hundred, we better go and leave him 
alone.” Rabbit say the same word again. The tiger leave on that. 
Lion would not. So he t’ought of another plan to out-scheme Lion. 
He told Lion to get one hundred barrel ashes, and that he must turn 
all in one spot, and he must stand in the middle of the heap, and when 
he fall, his flesh would season to a nice taste. Lion believe it. So he 
went and get the one hundred barrel ashes and stand up in the middle. 
Rabbit say, ‘‘Lion, look out! I am going to fall.”” So he did; and 
as he fall, he tosst himself about, and make a regular to-do in the 
ashes, and almost strangle Lion to death, give him cough and blind 
him. And as Lion trying to see and coughing, away went Rabbit 
and get clear of Lion. So one can still see how wise Rabbit was in 
all his plan.

Now, Bur Bookee had put up his wife to come and beg the cow. Little 
while after the cow was killed, Bur Bookee’s wife came and said, 
“Mr. Bur Bookee, please, sir, give me piece of beef.” He played like 
he was vex, and said, “Go ask Bur Patrick.” Bur Patrick said, 
“Give her piece.” And Bur Bookee gave her quarter. She went a 
little while, and came back big, stuffed up with rag, and her face 
was black as tar. ‘‘Mr. Bur Bookee, do please, sir, give me a piece 
of beef.” Bur Bookee started to curse and swear. ‘These old dog- 
face people, who, as soon as man kill a cow, they come! You better 
go to Bur Patrick.” Bur Patrick say, “Give her piece.” And he 
gave her half. The woman came back again, red this time, and 
walked like she is cripple. She said, ‘Do, Mr. Bur Bookee, please, 
sir, give me piece of beef. I almost died last night for piece.” Bur 
Bookee said, ‘“ Now, let me tell you one thing, you ugly, red chimpan- 
zee, you! if you come back here again, I will butt you down to the 
ground.” And he gave her another quarter. Bur Bookee said, 
“Now, this is all we got. Just mind them people give way all the 
meat.’”’ Bur Patrick said, ‘All right, share that quarter you have 
left.” Now, while Bur Bookee was sharing the beef, Bur Patrick had 
the heart and liver on the fire boiling. Now, Bur Bookee was so long 
sharing the beef, before the heart and liver was done, Bur Patrick 
said, ‘‘ Bur Bookee, my son, I going taste this thing first.” Bur Patrick 
knew all about Bur Bookee and his wife scheme. So Bur Patrick put 
some of the thing in his mouth. As soon as it touched his mouth, he 
fell down and vollowed on the ground. Bur Bookee said, “Man, 
wast matter?’”’ Bur Patrick say, ‘‘Man, poison, you better throw 
away that meat.’ Then Bur Patrick held in his breath. Then Bur 
Bookee got frighten’ and ran out, crying, ‘‘Oh! My wife! Oh! 
My wife!’’ His wife didn’ hear. He cried again, ‘‘Oh! My wife, 
wife, you can’t hear! Oh, bring that cow-meat! Bur Patrick is dead.

Jack went out fishing one day, and he had very bad luck. He 
went from drop to drop, and could not catch any fish. Last of all he 
went to a drop where he hook a fine yellow-tail. He pull it up to the

boat; and as he went to lift the fish in the boat, it drop off the hook. 
Jack never stand, he pitch overboard behind it. The yellow-tail 
went, Jack behind. Jack dive until when he blow, he blow on a 
strange little island. Jack was there all day till he began to get hungry. 
Jack stood up, and said, “Ah, well! if I was home, I would have had 
somewhere to go.”’ He heard a voice behind him: “Mr. Jack, there’s 
a house behind you.’”’ As he turn round and look, he saw a fine three- 
story house. He went to the house; but now it was late, and the 
house began to get dark: so Jack said, ‘Ah, well! if I was home, I 
would have had light.’’ The voice said, “Mr. Jack, there’s a lamp 
on the table.’’ Jack went and found the lamp and candle and 
matches. As he light the lamp, he said, ‘Ah, well! if I was home, 
I would have had something to eat.’ The voice said, ‘Mr. Jack, 
your dinner is on the table.” Jack went and found his dinner, and sat 
downandeat. When he was finish’, he said, “Ah, well! if I was home, 
I would have had a bed to sleep in.’’ The voice said, ‘‘Mr. Jack, 
there’s a bed in the room.” And so Jack went to bed. Next morning 
Jack said, “Ah, well! if I was home, I would have had breakfast.” 
The voice said, “Mr. Jack, your breakfast is on the table.” So Jack 
went and get his breakfast. In the evening Jack said the same thing, 
and he continue to say the same thing for seven days. This night 
more than all, his mother come to him in a dream, and told him if he 
wanted to see who it is that prepare him the house and supporting 
him, he must set the clock to alarm at twelve o’clock; and when the 
clock alarm, he must rise up and light a candle, and he will see. So 
Jack did so, and twelve o’clock the clock alarmed, Jack jump up and 
light the candle, an’ when he look in the bed, he saw a woman. She 
was the prettiest woman that eyes ever behold, and she had written 
across her breast in golden letters, ‘‘Maddy Glassker the glory of 
the world.” Jack could not stop looking till a little of the melted 
candle drop on her. Then she jump up and said to Jack, ‘‘ Well, Mr. 
Jack, since you is Mr. Jack and I am Maddy Glassker, the glory of 
the world, I am gone at the word.”” She and the house, with all that 
was in it, flash out of sight like lightning, making a great noise. And 
Jack was left alone on the rock again. So Jack remember his fine 
yellow-tail that he brought up to the boat, and the pretty woman 
that use to sleep in his bed; and while he thought of all this, he got 
so sad that his countenance I could not bear to see; so I turn myself 
round with a very brisk turn, only my turn was too brisk, for I could 
not stop myself until I buck up here to tell you this story; and if 
you don’t believe it, you can ask...

of the white man’s mythology). The Devil in the Bahama tales has something of this 
same general character. In some of the tales, however, he has taken on, I suspect, a 
more definitely Christian aspect. Not long since, if not to-day, Satan and hell were 
described to the islanders by their priests in vivid terms. One very intelligent man told 
me how his grandmother had described hell to him as a place of fire and brimstone. If 
you were thirsty there, the Devil would pour lead down your throat, which, if you did not 
swallow, he would ram down witha pestle. When you were toasted on one side, you would 
be burned on the other. ‘‘Would it hurt all the time?” the little boy had asked. “Yes, 
you'll be burning all the time — in hell, where you'll go if you are not good.”’

2 In a variant from Watling’s Island the colloquy between Old-Devil and each of the 
three companions in turn — Jim, Jill, and Jack —is, ‘‘Sweet too’, le’ me taste.” J., 
“Taste done pot.’”’ — “If you tell me so, I kick you.” He raise up some hair on his face, 
and holler. 
8 The narrator evidently should have mentioned the others. 
4 In the Watling’s tale, Jack knocks down Old-Devil with a belaying-pin, and nails 
him by his two ears to the wall. Old-Devil then “jerk an’ jerk until he jerk his head 
away an’ left his two ears. Das why smoke comes out kitchen through Old-Devil’s ears. 
He only got hole for fire.”” — In the Cape Verde Islands and in the Portuguese and Mexican 
tales the hero cuts off an ear of the giant or Negro. — In a Nicolls Town version Jack 
“rigged a gallias [gallows?] over a hole for b’o’ Devil.” B’o’ Devil tumbled in and broke 
his neck. Jack’s companions are Harry and Tom. yp

it might be born stiff or ‘limber, limber, jus’ like rag.” — If a pregnant woman eats 
“plenty sour things,” the child will be light; if she drinks coffee, it will be dark. If she

not join in the second “‘settin’-up.”” Remarriage within a month or so might involve 
“hanting’”’ by the deceased; but, even without remarriage, such persecution might 
happen. Two instances were given me of widows so “bodered’’ by their deceased hus- 
bands as to wear a black napkin around their body to preclude approaches. It is the 
husband who dies a sudden death who is apt to be troublesome. — Shutting the ghost or 
“huyg”’ out from your body by body wrappings is one of the ordinary methods on Andros 
Island of preventing the sickness a ghost brings you by entering into you.

The chantey goes, — 
“ And what do you think they had for dinner? 
A parrot’s tail and a monkey’s liver.” 
A native of Rutland, Vt., tells me that thirty or forty years ago her playmates sang, — 
The monkey married the baboon’s sister, 
Smacked his lips and then he kissed her. 
The kiss he gave her raised a blister 
And she set up a yell. 
Guess what they had for supper, 
Black-eyed beans, bread and butter. 
The rest was forgotten.

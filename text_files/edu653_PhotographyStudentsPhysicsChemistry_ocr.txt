PREFACE 
AFTER the acquiring of the necessary skill in manipula- 
tion, an inquiry into the nature of a photographic process 
is the first step in the direction of the systematic experi- 
ment which brings such pleasure to the genuine enthusiast 
and has done so much to advance the science and art of 
photography. Good handbooks of photographic manipu- 
lation are abundant; but as the real business of a hand- 
book is to give directions and not to explain principles, 
they are apt to be unsatisfactory to the thoughtful worker, 
interested in reasons as well as results. If he turns to 
complete treatises, of which there are also not a few, he is 
likely to find himself overwhelmed with an avalanche of 
detail and history, with much of which he is not at all 
concerned, and of no immediate interest or necessity. 
Neither do monographs offer great help, as a rule, for they 
are usually highly technical and confined to such limited 
portions of the photographic field that the desired informa- 
tion generally lies in the gaps between them. 
For some years past the author has given annually an 
elective series of experimental lectures at the Massachu- 
setts Institute of Technology, on tke general principles 
and processes of photography, to students who have 
studied physics and chemistry, having as a rule some 
knowledge of photographic manipulation and interested 
in its scientific aspect as well as its results. The present 
volume is the outgrowth of these lectures. It isan attempt 
to present a discussion of photographic processes, so far 
as their theories may be expressed in elementary form, so

that the photographic worker of ordinary scientific training 
may obtain a clearer idea of the nature and purpose of his 
operations. In its preparation it has been difficult to avoid 
the detail that properly belongs to a handbook or an 
extended treatise, and still more difficult to resist the 
temptation to discuss disputed and important points at 
length; but the endeavor has been made to find a middle 
ground, not primarily laid out for the tyro who needs to 
be told that undeveloped plates may not be examined in 
daylight, nor on the other hand for the skilled investigator 
who, for example, is seeking data on the spectra of dyes 
to sensitize his plates for the infra-red spectrum, but rather 
for the class of photographic workers who take pleasure 
in the subject for its own sake, who prefer to mix their 
own solutions rather than to buy them ignorantly in ready- 
labelled bottles, and who desire to supplement the hand- 
book with something less elaborate than the complete 
treatise and less technical than the specialized monograph. 
In a general work no great claim for originality can be 
made, except: in method of treatment; and in preparing 
the following pages the standard works on photographic 
science have been consulted freely. The author desires 
also to acknowledge the courtesy of the various firms men- 
tioned in the text, for the use of electrotypes of lenses and 
other apparatus.

PHOTOGRAPHY FOR STUDENTS OF 
PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY 
CHAPTER I. 
INTRODUCTORY. 
PHOTOGRAPHY may be defined as the art of producing 
fixed images by the action of light. Though this definition 
in strictness excludes those branches of the art in which the 
images are only shadows, as in X-ray work, the word pho- 
tography is at present extended to include such pictures, and 
even to embrace the results produced by almost any agency, 
if the materials used are those of ordinary photography. 
The photographic process has certain limitations, to be 
described more fully in the following pages; but, apart from 
these, it differs radically from other modes of pictorial repre- 
sentation, in that the image does not depend on the caprice or 
talent of the maker, at least so far as the representation of 
form is concerned. It is also not selective, every impression 
being recorded as received; so that the impersonality of the 
photographic record gives it a well-recognized scientific and 
judicial value that is entirely apart from its mere pictorial 
possibilities. 
The advantages of the photograph in this respect are 
threefold. In the first place, the absence of the personal 
element makes possible a complete and unbiased record of 
the fact, no matter how complex or full of detail it may be.

  2 PHOTOGRAPHY FOR STUDENTS 
The camera has no nerves and no uncertain prejudices, and 
does not suffer from lapse of memory, though its plates may 
be drugged into paralysis of function. Lacking the painter’s 
power of discrimination between essential and unessential 
details, it leaves little to the imagination; but though its 
artistic possibilities are diminished by its impersonal and 
undiscriminating character, this is the very quality that gives 
the photograph a high degree of value as a record. In this 
way it has come to pass that a camera and some knowledge 
of its possibilities are practically indispensable to the worker 
in either pure or applied science. 
Photography is often called the handmaid of the sciences, 
and it is at once a faithful servant and a powerful ally. In 
the work of pure science, every advance is fortified by pho- 
tographic records, and sometimes begun by them. In engi- 
neering and other branches of applied science the camera has 
assumed a place of rightful importance. It is as well-recog- 
nized a part of the equipment of a surveying party, for exam- 
ple, as the transit instrument; and it is common knowledge 
that there is no important work of constructive engineering 
that is not photographed in all stages of progress, whether 
it be bridge, “skyscraper,” ship, or tunnel. 
The second advantage of the photograph lies in the fact 
that under suitable conditions impressions can be recorded 
upon the sensitive plate with great rapidity, and hence it is 
possible to obtain a knowledge of the separate phases of a 
movement too rapid for the eye to analyze directly. A familiar 
illustration of this is the kinetoscope film, on which is photo- 
graphed an immense number of pictures of a moving object, 
taken in very rapid succession, each picture representing a 
phase of the motion lasting for only a few thousandths of a
-P-A-G-E-11
  INTRODUCTORY 3 
second. Though these films are nearly always employed 
to reproduce the moving scene, it is obvious that individual 
pictures may be studied at leisure and made to yield informa- 
tion otherwise quite unobtainable.’ 
A third advantage of the photograph arises from the cumu- 
lative character of photographic action. Prolonged exposure 
may give a photographic impression of an object which is much 
too faintly luminous to be seen directly by the eye. Examples 
of this effect are seen in photographs of faint stars and other 
celestial bodies. Many such pictures, obtained by exposures 
prolonged for hours, show details entirely beyond the visual 
reach of the most powerful telescopes. 
On the other hand, the photographic image has serious 
limitations. As a record of form, it is tightly bound by the 
laws of perspective, and it is subject to the conditions imposed 
by the optical system employed to produce it. The sensi- 
tiveness of the photographic plate is far from being in accord 
with the sensitiveness of the eye, and this may give an entirely 
false measure of the relative luminosity of different colors. 
Finally, the translation of the picture into monochrome 
greatly reduces its brilliancy, and causes the photograph to 
suffer severely by comparison with either the original or the 
painter’s conception of it. 
The definition given above implies three things: a self-lumi- 
nous or illuminated object, a suitable optical system, and a re- 
ceiving surface prepared in such a way as to permit the fixation 
of the image upon it. A study of the subject thus divides 
itself naturally into the optical problem of obtaining the image, 
and the chemical problem of giving it the necessary stability.

CHAPTER II. 
PIN-HOLES. 
For obtaining areal picture of a luminous object, the simplest 
optical system is the so-called pin-hole, which is merely a 
sharp-edged hole in an opaque screen. In Fig. 1, ab repre- 
sents an object from 
which light falls up- 
on the screen 5S, in 
which a small hole 
is pierced. It is evi- 
dent from the figure 
that each point of 
the object is the 
apex of a cone of 
rays passing through 
and bounded by the 
hole, and capable of 
being intercepted by a second screen, placed as at M. It is 
further clear that the image upon the second screen will not 
be sharply defined, for the object-point @ is represented by 
the image-area A; further, this lack of definition will increase 
as the pin hole is enlarged, though the brightness of the picture 
will increase in the same ratio. If the hole in the screen is 
circular, of course the spot A will be circular also if it lies 
directly opposite the hole, and elliptical elsewhere. The term 
circle of confusion is generally used to denote the image- 
areas of points, whether produced by pin-holes or lenses. 
4   Fic. rt. Formation of Pin-hole Image.
-P-A-G-E-13
  
PIN-HOLES 5 
The pin-hole has one important advantage which may be 
seen in the figure. If the screen is moved from the position 
M to N, the circle of confusion A is enlarged to A’; but as 
the image is magnified from AB to A’B’, in exactly the same 
ratio, the relative sharpness of the picture remains unaffected. 
Thus the size of the image may be varied at will, and there is 
no best position for the receiving screen, so far as distinctness 
is concerned. But as the image represents the same total of 
light-energy in every position, the intensity of the illumination 
over its surface will vary with its area; that is, the brightness 
of the picture will vary inversely as the square of the distance 
between pin-hole and image, and the time of exposure neces- 
sary for a given result will be directly proportional to the square 
of this distance. Obviously the illumination will also vary in 
direct proportion to the area of the hole. 
Best Diameter of Pin-Hole.— For the sake of increased 
sharpness of definition the diameter of the pin hole may be 
diminished, at 
the cost of in- 
creased length 
of exposure; 
but below a 
certain limit 
the phenome- 
non of diffrac- 
tion causes a 
loss of defini- 
tion which 
more than off- 
sets the gain. The effect is shown in Fig. 2, which is a pin- 
hole picture, not enlarged, of two points of light, taken with   Fic. 2. Full Size Pin-hole Image of Two Bright Points.

  6 PHOTOGRAPHY FOR STUDENTS 
a very small pin-hole and a plate at a considerable distance 
from it. The bright spots representing the image-areas of the 
points are seen to be surrounded by a series of diffraction 
rings, which at shorter distances lie so close together as to 
blend and produce a noticeable blurring of the edge of the 
image. Similar rings inside the image-circle are visible on 
the original negative, but are too faint for reproduction. It 
would therefore appear that there is a certain diameter of 
hole which will give maximum distinctness, though in order 
to calculate it, it is first necessary to define distinctness. For 
pin-hole photography, distinctness is usually defined as the 
maximum brightness at the center of the image, in which case 
the best diameter of the hole 
can be calculated readily. 
It is a theorem of physical 
optics that the maximum 
concentration of light at the 
center of the image is ob- 
  tained when the axial and 
marginalrays coming through

one half a wave-length of the 
light employed. This condition is outlined in Fig. 3, where 
: ; r the ray coming from the edge of the hole is represented as — 2 
longer than the central ray d, X being the wave-length of 
the incident light. From the figure it follows, if 7 is the 
radius of the hole, r\?

neglecting a which is very small. 4
-P-A-G-E-15
  PIN-HOLES ” 
Therefore, r= Vx. (1) 
Ordinary photographic plates have their maximum sen- 
sitiveness near the blue Fraunhofer line G of the spectrum, 
for which the wave-length A is about 0.000017 inch. Hence 
r= 0.0041 Vd. (2) 
This formula gives the following table: 
TABLE I. BEST DIAMETERS OF PIN-HOLES. 
  
JISTANCE BETWEEN PIN-HOLE Dist Best DIAMETER OF HOLE, 
  AND PLATE, ie 
3 inches 0.014 inch 
4 inches 0.016 inch 
5 inches 0.018 inch 
6 inches 0.020 inch 
8 inches 0.024 inch 
10 inches 0.026 inch 
  In the usual case, however, it makes very little difference 
whether the image-circle of a point is a spot whose maximum 
brightness is at its center or whether it is a small bright ring 
whose edges quickly fade into darkness; and as matter of 
fact good pictures can be obtained with diameters quite 
different from those above given. It is easy to make fairly 
satisfactory pin-hole experiments by removing the lens from 
an ordinary camera, pasting over the opening a sheet of the 
thick black paper in which photographic plates are wrapped, 
and then perforating the paper with a small red-hot needle. 
A better way of making the pin hole is to take a sheet of 
thin copper, barely puncture it with a needle point, and then 
rub off the burred edge on a fine-grained oilstone, keeping 
the hole clear by occasional reinsertions of the needle. A
-P-A-G-E-16

moment’s contact with the flame of a sulphur match will 
blacken the edges of the hole, and the result is a sharp-edged 
pin-hole that will last indefinitely. 
Brightness of Pin-hole Image. — Inspection of the fore- 
going table shows ‘hat doubling the distance between pin-hole 
and plate increases the best diameter of the hole enough to 
double its area; but as the image covers a quadrupled area 
at the double distance, it is only half as bright as before, and 
will require twice the exposure. Since the exposure is rather 
long at best, this means that work with “ long-focus ”’ pin- 
holes is apt to be unsatisfactory on account of the great length 
of exposure required. It is interesting to compare directly 
the brightness of the pin-hole image with that given by a 
lens. ‘Taking the 6-inch distance as above by way of illustra- 
tion, the diameter of the hole is 345 of the distance between 
hole and plate; and, comparing this with a lens working at J, 
a diameter fifty times as great, it is easy to see that the lens 
gives an image 2500 times as bright as the pin-hole, and 
that therefore the pin-hole will require an exposure 2500 
times as long as the lens.
-P-A-G-E-17
  CHAPTER III. 
THE LENS. 
THE illumination given by the pin-hole is much too feeble 
for most purposes, and the sharpness of the image leaves 
much to be desired. It is therefore usually necessary to 
obtain the image by means of a lens. There is a great gain 
in both brightness and definition; but a limitation also 
appears in the fact that the image is now formed in one par- 
ticular position, and with a given lens its size can be changed 
only by changing the distance between lens and object. 
Anything more than the slenderest outline of the theory of 
the photographic lens is beyond the scope of this work; but 
the user of photographic apparatus is often confronted by the 
necessity of knowing something of the properties and failings 
of his lenses, without going deeply into the mathematical 
analysis of the matter; and the following pages have been 
written with this in view. The lens is by far the most expen- 
sive and important single item in the outfit, and the quality 
of the work done depends primarily upon it. 
Axis of a Lens. Equivalent Planes. — Photographic lenses 
are always made with plane or spherical surfaces. Thecenters 
of curvature of these surfaces must lie on a straight line, if 
the lens is to give equally good definition over its whole field, 
and this line is called the axis of the lens. Not a little of the 
imperfection in definition attributed to other causes is really 
due to imperfect adjustment of the lens glasses so that their 
9

centers of curvature do not lie on the axis; but the fault can- 
not be corrected by the purchaser. 
To the mathematician Gauss and his successors is due the 
application of the formule for a simple lens to combinations 
of lenses, no matter how complex, and the simplification of the 
entire theory by the help of what are sometimes called equiva- 
lent planes. These are six planes perpendicular to the axis 
of the lens, and intersecting it in points that have important 
properties. Four of these points demand especial attention 
here. 
Nodal Points. — A ray of light, as ab in Fig. 4, may enter 
a lens obliquely in such a way as to emerge without angular

deviation, but it will have been shifted sidewise, as shown by 
the line cd. A prolongation of ab and cd will intersect the 
axis in the points N and N’, which are called nodal points. 
They play an important part in the modern theory of lenses. 
They have among other peculiarities the property which 
may be expressed in words by saying that a ray entering the 
lens from any direction toward either of them will emerge from 
the lens parallel to its original course, but as if it had come 
directly from the other. This property, therefore, gives a con- 
venient method of ascertaining the final direction of a ray

THE LENS It 
without tracing its actual path through the components of 
the lens itself, provided the position of the nodal points is 
known. The point JN is called the nodal point of incidence or 
admission, the point N’ the nodal point of emergence. 
In lenses of different types the nodal points vary widely in 
position. They may coincide or be separated by a consider- 
able interval, or the nodal point of emergence may lie on the 
  Fic. 5. Position of Nodal Points of Various Simple Lenses. 
side toward the incident ray. Figure 5 shows their positions 
for some simple types of lenses, N being the nodal point of 
admission and N’ of emergence. The light-rays are supposed 
to pass from left to right in the figure; if their direction is 
reversed, N and N’ simply exchange places. In telephoto- 
graphic lenses both nodal points are in front of the lens 
combination, and may be several feet away from the glasses. 
Focal Points. — A beam of light made up of parallel rays, 
sunlight, for example, allowed to shine upon a lens in the 
direction of its axis, will be refracted more or less perfectly to 
a point on the axis itself. This is illustrated in Fig. 6. If 
the lens receives light from a very distant object (the rays 
from which are practically parallel), the image will be found in 
a plane perpendicular to the axis at F. This plane is called 
the focal plane of the lens, the point F the focal point or the 
principal focus, and the distance / between it and the nodal

point of emergence is called the focal length of the lens. By 
turning the lens end for end, a second focal point F’ may be

four points, N, N’, F, and F’, with the planes drawn through

In treatises on optics’ it is shown that from the positions of

  THE LENS 13 
from the point a parallel to the axis of the lens will be re- 
fracted as if it had passed through the lens without deviation 
as far as the plane through the nodal point of emergence NV’, 
and there had been refracted so as to pass straight through 
the rear focal point F. The actual path through the glass is 
quite different, of course, but the result is the same as if the 
course indicated by the dotted line had been followed, the 
convenience of the method being that nothing need be known 
or assumed in regard to the actual refraction at the surfaces 
of the lens. A ray from @ which passes through the front 
focal point F’ will be refracted as if it had passed undeviated 
through to the plane through the nodal point NV, and thence 
parallel to the axis of the lens, meeting the first ray at the point 
a’. Thus the image of the point a will be found at a’, and by 
similar reasoning the image of b will be found at 0’. Denot- 
ing by p the distance between the object and N, the nodal 
point of incidence, and by p’ the distance between N’, the 
nodal point of emergence, and the image, the similar tri- 
angles of the figure give the relation 
size of object_p—-f__ f_ (3) pf size of image } 
which reduces to 
(4) 
a simple and fundamental relation. 
From this may be readily deduced another useful pro- 
portion :

This gives an important rule for copying, either enlarging 
or reducing. It may be put into words as follows: 
I ° ° , °° 
To get a copy — the linear size of the original, place the n 
object to be photographed outside the front focal point of 
the lens and at a distance from it equal to m times the focal 
length of the lens. The image will then be of the desired 
size and ~ of the focal length behind the rear focal point. n 
Similarly, to get an image m times as large as the object, set 
the object ~ of the focal length away from the front focal n 
point; the image will then be found m focal lengths behind 
the rear focal point. 
The focal length and the position of the focal points hav- 
ing been determined once for all, no further measurements 
for copying than the above need be made, and the most accu- 
rate proportions can be obtained without recourse to the too 
frequent and often tedious process of trial and error. 
Measuring the Focal Length. — Figure 7 and the accom- 
panying equations afford a ready explanation of the following 
simple methods of determining the focal length of a convex 
lens.
-P-A-G-E-23
  THE LENS 15 
I. With the lens in the camera, focus as accurately as 
possible upon some very distant object, and mark the posi- 
tion of the lens board on the camera bed. If the camera is 
of the back-focusing type, in which the lens is fixed and the 
ground glass the movable portion, the position of the ground 
glass is to be marked. Next focus on an object placed so 
near the lens that object and image are of the same size. This 
measurement is most conveniently and accurately made by 
cutting a piece, of any convenient size and shape, from the 
middle of a sheet of opaque paper, and pasting the paper on 
a window pane to serve as the object. The paper cutting 
may be held directly against the ground glass as a means of 
comparing its size with that of the image of the hole. Re- 
focusing is of course necessary, and a number of trials at 
different distances may be required. By marking the new 
position of the lens (or ground glass) on the camera bed, the 
focal length of the lens is obtainable without further compu- 
tation, because the elongation of the camera bellows required 
to obtain the second focus is exactly equal to the focal length 
of the lens. 
II. Although most cameras that are not toys permit the 
necessary extension, it sometimes happens that the bellows 
will not stretch sufficiently to make the second adjustment. 
In such a case it is only necessary to have the image a known 
fraction of the size of the object, say one half or one third of 
its linear dimensions. The elongation of the bellows will 
then be the same fraction of the focal length of the lens, as 
will appear from the preceding rule for copying. For this 
purpose the best object to use is a divided scale in a good light. 
An ordinary foot rule will answer.

in equation (4), and reducing, the following relation is ob- 
tained: 
f= xy. (9) 
This is the basis of another exact method, which, though 
less simple than the preceding, gives the position of the focal 
points as well as the focal length. It is as follows: 
(a) Reverse the lens in its mount, and focus on a very dis- 
tant object. Measure along the axis the distance /’ (Fig. 8 a), 
between the image and any convenient part of the lens mount- 
ing. This locates the front focal point at F’.

This locates the rear focal point at F (Fig. 8 0).

  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, 
DIVISION OF FORESTRY, 
Washington, D. C., May 8, 1899, 
Sir: [have the honor to transmit herewith the man- 
uscript of the first half of “A Primer of Forestry,” and 
to recommend its publication’ as Bulletin No. 24, Part 
I, of this Division. The present part (“The Forest”) 
deals with the units which compose the forest, with its 
character as an organic whole, and with its enemies. 
It may be said to sketch the foundation of the practice 
of forestry and of forest policy. Part II will be enti- 
tled “ Practical Forestry,” and will deal with the prac- 
tice of forestry, with work in the woods, with the 
relations of the forest to the weather and the streams, 
and will conclude with a brief description of forestry at 
home and abroad. 
For many of the illustrations of Part I, I am in- 
debted to the kindness of several gentlemen. not con- 
nected with this Division. Their names and the plates 
and figures which I owe to their courtesy are as follows:

  A PRIMER OF FORESTRY. 
CHAPTER I. 
THE EIFE OFA TREE, 
/ The object of forestry is to discover and apply the 
principles according to which forests are best managed. 
It is distinct from arboriculture, which deals with indi- 
vidual trees. Forestry has to do with single trees only 
as they stand together on some large area whose prin- 
cipal crop is trees, and which therefore forms part of a 
forest. (See frontispiece.) The forest is the most highly 
organized portion of the vegetable world. It takes its 
importance less from the individual trees which help to 
form it than from the qualities which belong to it as a 
whole. Although it is composed of trees, the forest is 
far more than a collection of trees standing in one 
place. It has a population of animals and plants pecul- 
iar to itself, a soil largely of its own making, and a 
climate different in many ways from that of the open 
country. Its influence upon the streams alone makes 
farming possible in many regions, and everywhere it 
tends to prevent floods and drought. It supplies fuel, 
one of the first necessaries of life, and lumber, the raw 
material, without which cities, railroads, and all the 
great achievements of material progress would have 
i

  been either long delayed or wholly impossible. (See 
Pl...) The forest is as beautiful as it is useful. The old 
fairy tales which spoke of it 
as a terrible place are wrong. 
No one can really know the 
forest without feeling the gen- 
tle influence of one of the 
kindliest and strongest parts 
ofnature. From every point 
of view it is one of the most 
helpful friends of man, Per- 
haps no other natural agent 
has done so much for the 
human race and has been so 
recklessly used and so little 
understood. 
THE PARTS OF A TREE. 
In order rightly to under- 
stand the forest, something 
must first be known about 
the units of which it is made 
up. A tree, then, is a woody 
plant growing up from the 
ground usually with a single 
stem. (See fig. 1.) It con- 
sists of three parts: First, 
the roots, which extend into 
s,stem,and crown of the ground to a depth of 3 or 
ellbark Hickory. Mil- 4 feet, or still farther when 
the soil is not too hard and 
they do not find moisture enough near the surface. (See 
figs. 2,3, and Pls. II, III.) They hold the tree in place,

  and take up from the soil water and certain mineral sub- 
stances which the tree needs 
inits growth. Second, the 
trunk, stem, or bole, which 
supports the crown and sup- 
plies it with mineral food 
and water from the roots. 
(See fig. 4.) Third, the 
crown itself, with its net- 
work of branches,buds, and 
leaves, in which the food 
taken up by the tree from 
the soil and air is worked 
over and made ready to 
assist in the growth of 
the whole plant. (See figs. 
5-7 and Pl. IV.) The 
crown has more to do with 
the life of the tree than its 
other parts, for the most 
important processes in the 
reproduction ofthe treeand 
the digestion of its food 
take place in the crown. 
For this reason, and be- 
cause we can control its 
shape and size more easily 
and directly than that of 
the roots or trunk, the 
erown is of special inter- 
est to the forester. It is 
almost exclusively with the 
crowns that he has to deal

and preparing the way for the succeeding genera- 
tion. As they stand together in the forest, the crowns 
of the trees form a broken shelter, 
which is usually spoken of as the 
leaf canopy, but which may better 
be called the cover. (See fig. 8.) 
THE FOOD OF A TREE. 
The materials upon which a tree 
feeds are derived from the soil and 
theair. The minute root hairs which 
spring from the rootlets take up 
water from the ground, and with it 
various substances which it holds in 
solution. These are the earthy con- 
stituents of the tree, which reappear 
in the form of ashes when any part of 
it is burned. The water which cou- 
tains these materials goes straight 
from the roots to the leaves, in which 
a inost important process in the feed- 
ing of the tree takes place. This proc- 
‘ess is the assimilation or taking up 
and breaking up, by the leaves, of 
carbonic acid gas from the air. It 
goes on only in the presence ot light 
and heat, and through the action of 
chlorophyll, a substance from which 
the leaves and the young bark get Fie.5.—Crown andstem of a young Western

which contain chlorophyll break up the carbonic acid 
gas with which they come in contact, retain the carbon, 
one of its elements, and send back the other, oxygen, 
into the air. Then, still 
under the influence of the 
sunlight, they combine the 
carbon with the oxygen 
and hydrogen of the water

then either used at once in growth or stored away until 
the proper moment arrives. This is the general rule, 
butit is believed that in some cases food taken up by 
the roots can be used 
without first being 
digested in the leaves.

OF WOOD. 
Wood is made up 
chiefly of carbon, oxy- 
gen, and hydrogen.

When perfectly dry, about half its 
weight is carbon, and half oxygen 
and hydrogen, in almost the same 
proportion as in water. It contains 
also about 1 part in 100, by weight, 
of earthy constituents, and nitrogen —y¢.11.—Woodandbark

  THE BREATHING OF A TREE, 15 
HOW THE TREE BREATHES. 
Besides giving out oxygen in assimilation, trees also 
take in oxygen from the air throngh their leaves, and 
through the minute openings in the bark called lenticels, 
such as the oblong raised spots or marks on the young 
  of the Western Yellow 
Pine. The cut is a 
cross section and 
would have been hor- 
izontal as the speci- 
men stood in the tree.

branches of Birch and Cherry and 
many other trees. All plants, like 
all animals, breathe; and plants, like 
animals, breathe in oxygen and 
breathe out carbonic acid gas. This 
process of respiration or the breathing 
of the tree goes on both day and night, 
but it is far less active than assimila- 
tion, which takes place only in the light. Consequently 
more carbonie acid -gas is taken into the tree than is 
given out, and the surplus carbon remains to be used 
in growing.  
-P-A-G-E-26
  16 A PRIMER OF FORESTRY, 
TRANSPIRATION, 
The leaves give out not only the oxygen derived from 
the decomposition of carbonic acid gas taken from the 
  Fig. 14.—By comparing this diagram with 
Pls. VII-IX and fig. 16, the place of each 
cut in the tree will be made clear,

gas produced in breath- 
ing, butalso great quan- 
tities of water vapor. 
The amount of water 
taken up by the roots is 
very much larger than 
is required to be com- 
bined with carbon and 
the earthy constituents 
in the leaves. In order 
that fresh supplies of 
  earthy constituents in solution may reach the leaves 
rapidly, the water already in them must be got out of 
the way. This is effected by 
transpiration, which is the evap- 
oration of water from all parts of 
the tree above ground, but princi- 
pally from the leaves. Even 
where the bark is very thick, as 
on the trunks of old Oaks and 
Chestnuts, transpiration goes on 
through the lenticels in the bot- 
toms ‘of the deep cracks. It 
sometimes happens, especially in 
spring before the leaves come 
out, that transpiration can not 
get rid of the water from the roots

  THE GROWTH OF A TREE. 
The addition of new material in the way described in 
the preceding pages is the foundation of growth. Ex- 
cept in the buds, leaves, fruit, and the twigs less than 
a year old, this material is deposited in a thin coat over 
the whole tree between the wood and the bark. The 
new twigs grow in length by a kind of stretching, but 
only during the first year. Thus it is only by means of ~ 
these youngest twigs that a 
tree increases in height and 
in spread of branches. After 
the first year their length is 
fixed, younger twigs stretch 
out from the buds, and the 
older ones grow henceforth 
only in thickness. (See fig. 
9.) The fresh coat of new

sawed lengthwise from this tree, There are two layers in this 
Peclning whee the lek tne oar, separated by a third oue of tender forming tissues 
called the cambium, in which the actual making of the 
new substance goes on. The inner side of the cambium 
layer forms new wood, the outer side new bark. Be- 
sides the true cambium, which forms both wood and 
bark, there is another cambium which makes the corky 
outer bark, and nothing else. This cork cambium may 
encircle the whole tree, like the true cambium, as in the 
Red Cedar, or it may form little separate films in the 
bark, but in either case it dies from time to time, and 
is re-formed nearer the wood. (See figs. 10-13 and Pls. V 
and VI.)

THE FORMATION OF WOOD. 19 
THE STRUCTURE OF WOOD. 
Wood is chiefly made up of very small tubes or cells 
of various kinds, which have special uses in the life of 
the tree. Some conduct water from the roots to the 
crown, some store away digested food, and others merely 
strengthen the structure of the wood and hold it to- 
gether. The wood of cone-bearing or coniferous trees

(like the Pines and Spruces) has but few kinds of 
cells, while that of the broadleaf trees (such as Oaks and 
Maples) ismuchlesssimple. (Seefigs. 14, 16, 20, and Pls. 
VII-IX.) Butin each case some of the cells have thick 
walls and small openings, and others wide openings and 
very thin walls. In climates which have regularly one

zen, Berlin, 1891.) 
  season of growth and one of rest, 
like our own, the cells of the layer 
of new wood formed each year 
' at the inner surface of the eam- 
bium are arranged in a definite 
way. When growth begins in the 
spring, and the fresh twigs and 
| leaves put out, there is a great 
demand for water in the crown 
| to supply these moist green new 
parts of the tree. Water rises in 
most trees through the newer lay- 
ers of the wood, and especially 
through the last ring. Conse- 
quently, at first the tree makes 
thin-walled celis with wide open- 
ings, through which water can 
rise rapidly to the end§ of the 
| branches. Later on, when the de- 
mand for water is not so great, 
and there is plenty of digested 
food to supply building material, 
the cells formed are narrow and 
thick-walled. (See fig. 20.) Thus 
the summer wood in each year’s 
growth is heavier, stronger, and 
darker in color than the spring 
wood. In the wood of many 
broadleaf trees, such as Oak and 
Chestnut, the spring wood is also 
marked by a band of open tubes 
of larger size called ducts, In 
others, such as Maple and Beech,

-P-A-G-E-37
  THE FORMATION OF WOOD. 21 
these ducts are scat- 
tered through the 
whole season’s growth, 
and in all conifers, as 
for example the Pines 
and Cedars, they are 
entirely wanting. 
But the differences in 
hardness and color 
between the growth 
of spring and summer 
are still present. It 
is sometimes possible 
to see the line which 
separates the growth 
of two seasons in the 
bark, as in the case of 
common cork, which 
is the outer bark of 
the Cork Oak, a na- 
tive of southern Eu- 
rope. (See fig. 15,) 
If the trunk or 
branch of an Oak 
tree is cut smoothly 
across, thin whitish 
lines may be seen run- 
ning from within out- 
ward. Some of these 
lines begin in the cen- 
ter of the tree, and 
others in each one of 
the annual rings.

These are the medullary rays, which make the silver 
grain in quartered Oak and other woods. (See figs. 17, 
19, 22, and Pls. VII-IX.) They exist in all kinds of 
trees, but in many, as, for example, in the Chestnut and 
in most conifers, they are so fine as hardly to be seen 
  
    
Fig. 22.—Slab sawed lengthwise from a Black Oak. Milford, Pa. The saw 
passed almost through the center of the tree, but not quite: The lines of an- 
nual growth are cut through obliquely, and the silver grain appears quite 
plainly, both in the middle and at the sides. 
with the naked eye. Seasoning cracks which run across 
the rings of growth always follow the lines of these rays, 
while others most often follow along some annual ring. 
ANNUAL RINGS. 
It is correct to speak Of these rings of growth as 
“annual rings,” for as long as the tree is growing 
healthily a ring is formed each year. (See figs. 17, 22, and

    HEARTWOOD AND SAPWOOD. 23. 
Pls. VII-X.) It is true that two false rings may appear 
in one year, but they are generally so much thinner 
than the rings on each side that it is not hard to detect 
them. Very often they do not extend entirely around 
the tree, as a true ring always does if the tree is sound. 
Whenever the growth of the tree is interrupted and 
begins again during the same season, such a false ring 
is formed. This happens when the foliage is destroyed 
by caterpillars and grows again in the same season, or 
when a very severe drought in early summer stops 
growth for a time, after late frosts, and in similar cases. 
HEARTWOOD AND SAPWOOD. 
An annual layer once formed does not change in size 
or place during the healthy life of the tree, except that 
it is covered in time by other younger layers. A nail 
driven into a tree 6 feet from the ground will still be 
at the same height after it is buried under 20 or 50 or 
100 layers of annual growth. But in most trees, like the 
Oaks and Pines, the wood becomes darker in color and 
harder after it has been in the tree for some years. The 
openings of its cells become choked so that the sap can 
no longer run through them. From living sapwood, in 
which growth is going on, it becomes heartwood, which 
is dead, because it has nothing to do with growth. (See 
figs.19, 21.) It is simply a strong framework which helps 
to support the living parts of the tree. This is why hol- 
low trees may flourish and bear fruit. Sapwood rots 
more easily than heartwood, because it takes up water 
readily and contains plant food, which decays very fast. 
Not all trees have heartwood, and in many the differ- 
ence in color between it and the sapwood is very slight. 
Since water from the roots rises only in the sapwood, it

is easy to kill trees with heartwood by girdling them, 
provided all the sapwood is cut through. But in those 
which have no heartwood the tubes of the older layers 
of wood can still convey water to the crown, and when 
such trees are girdled it is often several years before 
they die. 
A great many theories have been proposed to account 
for the rise of water into the tops of tall trees, some of 
which, as in the big trees of California, may be over 
300 feet from the ground. But none of these theories 
are quite satisfactory, and it must be admitted that we 
do not yet know how the trees supply their lofty 
crowns with the water which keeps them alive.

  CHAPTER II. 
TREES IN THE FOREST. 
The nature of a tree, as shown by its behavior in the 
forest, is called its silvicultural character. It is made 
up of all those qualities upon which the species as a 
whole, and every individual tree, depends in its strug- 
gle for existence. The regions in which a tree will live, 
and the places where it will flourish best; the trees it 
will grow with, and those which it kills or is killed by; 
its abundance or scarcity; its size and rate of growth— 
all these things are decided by the inborn qualities, or 
silvicultural character, of each particular kind of tree. 
THE VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS OF TREES, 
Different species of trees, like different races of men, 
have special requirements for the things upon which 
their life depends. Some races, like the Eskimos, live 
only in cold regions. (See Pl. XI.) Others, like the 
South Sea Islanders, must have a very warm climate 
to be comfortable, and are short-lived in any other. (See 
fig. 23.) So it is with trees, except that their different 
needs are even more varied and distinct. Some of 
them, like the Willows, Birches, and Spruces of north- 
ern Canada, stand on the boundary of tree growth 
within the Arctic Circle. Other species grow only in 
tropical lands, and can not resist even the lightest 
frost. (See Pl. XII.) It is always the highest and low- 
est temperature, rather than the average, which decides 
where a tree will or will not grow. Thus the average 
temperature of an island where it never freezes may be 
25

26 A PRIMER OF FORESTRY. 
only 60°, while another place, with an averageof 70°, may 
have occasional frosts. Trees which could not live at all 
in the second of these places, on account of the frost, 
might flourish in the lower average warmth of the first. 
In this way the bearing of trees toward heat and 
cold has a great deal to do with their distribution over 
the surface of the whole earth. Their distribution 
within shorter distances also often depends largely 
upon it. In the United States, for example, the Live 
Oak does not grow 
in Maine, nor the 
Canoe Birch in Flor- 
ida. Even the op- 
posite sides of the 
same hill may be 
covered with two 
different species, be- 
cause one of them 
resists the late and 
early frosts and the 
fierce midday heat 
of summer, while the other requires the coolness and 
moisture of the northern slope. (See fig. 24.) On 
eastern slopes, where the sun strikes early in the day, 
frosts in the spring and fall are far more apt to kill 
the young trees, or the blossoms and twigs of older 
ones, than on those which face to the west and north, 
where’ growth begins later in the spring, and where 
rapid thawing, which does more harm than the freez- 
ing itself, is less likely to take place.

The Teak tree yields one of the most durable and valuable kinds of timber, especially adapted to shipbuilding, but it will not giow where there is the slightest frost. Its durability is shown by the condition of the old stump, from which the large tree on the left grew as a sprout.

well, while a cool northern slope is almost always moister 
than one turned toward the south. Still the results 
of the demand of trees for water can usually be distin-

itis found that moisture has almost as great an influ-

itself. Indeed, within any given region it is apt to be

much more conspicuous, and the smaller the region the 
more noticeable often is its effect, because the contrast 
is more striking. Thus it is frequently easy to see the 
difference between the trees in a swamp and those ona 
dry hillside near by, when it would be far less easy to 
distinguish the general character of the forest which 
includes both swamp and hillside from that of another

forest at a distance. (See fig. 25.) In many instances 
the demand for water controls distribution altogether. 
For this reason the forests on the opposite sides of 
mountain ranges are often composed of entirely differ- 
ent trees. On the west slope of the Sierra Nevada 
of California, for example, where there is plenty of 
moisture, there is also one of the most beautifull of 
all forests. (See fig. 26 and Pl. XIII.) The east

slope, on-the contrary, has almost no trees, because 
its rainfall is very slight, and those which do grow 
there are small and stunted in comparison with the 
giants on the west. (See Pl. XIV.) Again, certain 
trees, like the Bald Cypress and the River Birch, grow 
only in very moist land; others, like the Mesquite and 
the Pinyon or Nut Pine, only on the driest soils; while

  still others, like the Red Cedar and the Red Fir, 
seem to adapt themselves to almost any degree of 
moisture, and are found on very wet and very dry 
soils alike. In this way the different demands for 
moisture often separate the kinds of trees which grow 
in the bottom of a valley from those along its slopes, 
or even those in the gullies of hillsides from those on

Such matters as these have far 
more to do with the places in which 
different trees grow than the chemi 
cal composition of the soil. But its 
mechanical nature—that is, whether 
it is stiff or loose, fine or coarse in 
grain, deep or shallow—is very im- 
portant, because it is directly con- 
nected with heat and moisture and 
the life of the roots in the soil. 
REQUIREMEN'S OF TREES FOR 
LIGHT. 
The relations of trees to heat and 
moisture are thus largely responsible 
for their distribution upon the great 
divisions of the earth’s surface, such 
as continents and mountain ranges, 
as well as over the smaller rises aud 
depressions of every region where 
trees grow. But while heat and mois- 
ture decide where the different kinds 
of trees can grow, their influence has 
comparatively little to do with the 
struggles of individuals or species 
against each other for the actual pos- 
session ofthe ground. The outcome of 
these struggles depends less on heat.

and moisture than on the possession of certain qualities, 
among which is the ability to bear shade. With regard 
to this power trees are roughly divided into two classes, 
often called shade-bearing and light-demanding, follow- 
ing the German, but better named tolerant and intoler- 
antof shade. (See figs. 27, 28.) Tolerant trees are those 
which flourish under more or less heavy shade in early

youth; intolerant trees are those which demand a com- 
paratively slight cover, or even unrestricted light. 
Later in life all trees require much more light than at 
first, and usually those of both classes can live to old 
age only when they are altogether unshaded from above. 
But there is always this difference between them: the 
leaves of tolerant trees will bear more shade. Conse-

characters. Frequently it is the     the case with intoler- 
ant trees. Thus the 
crown of a tolerant 
tree in the forest is 
usually denser and 
longer than that of 
one which bears less 
shade. It is usually 
true that the seed- 
lings of trees with 
dense crowns are able 
to flourish under 
cover, while those of 
light-crowned _ trees 
are intolerant. This 
rough general rule is 
often of use in the 
study of forests in a 
new country, or of 
trees whose silvicul- 
tural character is not 
known. 
TOLERANCE AND IN-

The tolerance or in- 
tolerance of trees is 
one of their most im- 
portant silvicultural

seeks to learn about them, because what he can safely

undertake in the woods depends so largely upon it. 
Thus tolerant trees will often grow vigorously under 
the shade of light-crowned trees above them, while if 
the positions were 
reversed the latter 
would speedily die. 
(See Pl XVI) The 
proportion of differ- 
ent kinds of trees in

on their tolerance.

with its age, but also with the place where it is grow- 
ing, and with its health. An intolerant tree will stand

northern region, and more if it has plenty of water 
than with a scanty supply. Vigorous seedlings will 
get along with less light than sickly ones. Seedlings 
of the same species will prosper under heavier shade 
if they have always grown under cover than if they 
have had plenty of light at first and have been de- 
prived of it afterwards.

THE RATE OF GROWTH. 
The rate of growth of different trees often decides 
which one will survive in the forest. For example, if 
two intolerant kinds of trees should start together on a 
burned area or an old field, that one which grew faster 
in height would overtop the other and destroy it in the 
end by cutting off the light. Some trees, like the 
Black Walnut, grow rapidly from their earliest youth. 
  
  
  kota. The trees here are smaller in size than those of Montana (see fig. 35), 
but their power of reproduction is much greater: 
Others grow very slowly for the first few years. The 
stem of the Longleaf Pine, at 4 years old, is usually 
not more than 5 inches in length. During this time 
the roots have been growing instead of the stem. The 
period of its rapid growth in height comes later. 
The place where a tree stands has a great influence 
on its rate of growth. Thus the trees on a hillside are 
often much smaller than those of equal age in the rich

hollow below, and those on the upper slopes of a high 
mountain are commonly starved and stunted in com- 
parison with the vigorous forest lower down. (See Pl. 
XVIL) The Western Chinquapin, which reaches a 
height of 150 feet in the coast valleys of northern 
California, is a mere shrub 
at high elevations in the 
Sierra Nevada. The same 
thing often appears in passing 
from the more temperate re- 
gions to the far north. Thus 
the Canoe Birch, at its north- 
ern limit, rises only a few 
inches above the ground, 
while farther south it becomes 
a tree sometimes 120 feet in 
height. 5

power of his trees. Except 
in the case of sprouts and other growth fed by old 
roots, this depends first of all on the quantity of the 
seed which each tree bears; but so many other con- 
siderations affect the result that a tree which bears seed 
abundantly may not reproduce itself very well. (See 
fig. 30.) A part of the seed is always unsound, and 
sometimes much the larger part, as in the case of the 
Tulip Tree. But even a great abundance of sound seed 
does not always insure good reproduction. The seeds

may not find the right surroundings for successful ger- 
mination, or the infant trees may perish for want of 
water, light, or suitable soil. Where there is a thick 
layer of dry leaves or needles on the ground, seedlings 
often perish in great numbers because their delicate 
rootlets can not reach the fertile soil beneath. The 
same thing‘happens when there is no humus at all and 
the surface is hard and dry. The weight of the seed 
also has a powerful influence on the character of repro- 
duction. Trees with 
heavy seeds, like 
Oaks, Hickories, 
and Chestnuts, can 
sow them only in 
their own neighbor- 
hood, except when 
they stand on steep 
hillsides or on the 
banks of streams, 
or when birds and 
squirrels carry the 
nuts and acorns to 
a distance. (See Pl. 
XVIII.) Trees with 
light, winged seeds, like the Poplars, Birches, and 
Pines, have a great advantage over the others, be- 
cause they can drop their seeds a long way off. (See 
figs. 31, 32.) The wind is the means by which this is 
brought about, and the adaptation of the seeds them- 
selves is often very curious and interesting. The wing 
of a Pine seed, for example, is so placed that the seed 
whirls when it falls, in such a way that it. falls very 
slowly. Thus the wind has time to carry it away before 
it can reach the ground. In heavy winds Pine and other

winged seeds are blown long distances—sometimes as 
much as several miles. 
This explains how certain 
kinds of trees, like the 
Gray Birch and the White 
Pine, grow up in the mid- 
dle of open pastures, and 
how others, such as the 
Lodgepole Pine, cover 
great areas, far from the 
parent trees, with young 
growth of even age. 
THE SUCCESSION OF 
FOREST TREES. 
Such facts help to ex- 
plain why, in certain 
places, it happens that 
when Pines are cut down 
Oaks succeed them, or 
when Oaks are removed 
Pines occupy the ground. 
It is very often true that 
young trees of one kind 
are already growing un- 
noticed beneath old trees 
of another, and so are ™ 
ready to replace them 
whenever the upper story is cut away. (See fig. 33.)

    PURE AND MIXED FOREST, 
The nature of the seed has much to do with the distri- 
bution of trees in pure or mixed forest. It is the habit 
of some trees to grow in bodies of some extent contain-

ing. only a single kind; in other words, in pure forest. 
(See fig. 34 and Pl. XIX.) The Longleaf Pine of the 
South Atlantic and Gulf States is of this kind, and 
so is the Lodgepole Pine of the West. Conifers are 
more apt to grow in pure 
forest than broadleaf trees, 
because it is more common 
for them to have winged 
seeds. The greater part of 
the heavy-seeded trees in 
the United States are de- 
ciduous,. and most of the 
deciduous trees grow in 
mixed forest, although there 
are some conspicuous excep- 
tions. But even in mixed 
forests small groups of trees 
with heavy seeds are com- 
mon, because the young trees 
naturally start up beneath 
and around the old ones. 
A heavy seed, dropping from 
the top of a tall tree, often 
strikes the lower branches 
in its fall and bounds far out- 
side the circle of the crown. 
Trees which are found only, 
or most often, in pure forest 
are the social or gregarious 
kinds; those which grow in mixture with other trees 
are called scattered kinds. Most of the hardwood for- 
ests in the United States are mixed; and many mixed 
forests, like that in the Adirondacks, contain both broad-     FiG:~38.—Sprouts of Gray Birch

leaf trees and conifers. (See fig. 36 and Pls. XX, X XI.) 
The line between gregarious and scattered species is not 
always well marked, because it often happens that a 
tree may be gregarious in one place, and live with many 
others elsewhere. The Western Yellow Pine, which 
forms, on the plateau of central Arizona, perhaps the 
largest pure Pine for- 
est of the earth, is 
frequently found 
growing with other 
species in the moun- 
tains, especially in 
the Sierra Nevada of 
central California. 
(See figs. 34, 35.) 
Trees which oe-

the exclusion of all 
others do so because 
they succeed better, 
under the  condi-

on with less water, or 
to grow on poorer soil, their rate of growth or power of re- 
production may be greater, or there may be some other 
reason why they are better fitted for their surroundings. 
But the gregarious trees are not all alike in their ability 
to sustain themselves in different situations, while the 
differences between some of the mixed-forest species 
are very marked indeed. Thus Black Walnut, as a

rule, grows only in rich moist soil, and Beech only in 
damp situations. Fire Cherry, on the other hand, is 
most common on lands which have been devastated by 
fire, and the Rock Oak is most often found on dry bar- 
ren ridges. The Tupelo or 
Black Gum and the Red 
Maple both grow best in 
swamps, but it is a common 
thing to find them also on 
dry stony soils at a distance 
from water. The knowledge 
of such qualities as these is

Besides reproduction from

sprouts from old roots or 
stumps is of great impor- Fig. 40.—Chestnut sprouts from

in their power of sprouting. In nearly all conifers ex- 
cept the California coast Redwood, which has this ability 
beyond almost every other, tree, it is lacking altogether. 
The Pitch or Jack Pine of the Eastern United States 
has it also to some extent, but in most places the 
sprouts usually die in early youth, and seldom make 
merchantable trees. (See fig. 39 and Pl. XXII.) In the 
broadleaf kinds, on the other hand, it is a general and

A year before the picture was taken a forest fire passed over this place and burned to the 
top of the tree, destroying all the needles ; yet, the tree was not killed, although scarcely any other kind could have survived. It put out a vigorous growth of suckers, 
and it still has a chance for life. Such examples are common throughout the burnt 
parts of southern New Jersey, where large and vigorous sprouts from the roots of trees of this species which have been killed to the ground by fire are very frequent.

very valuable quality. Young stumps, as a rule, are 
much more productive than old ones, although some 
prolific species, like the Chestnut (see fig. 40), sprout 
plentifully in old age. Other species, like the Beech, 
furnish numerous sprouts from young stumps and very 
few or none at all from old ones, and still others never 
sprout freely even in early youth.

  CHAPTER IIT. 
THE LIFE OF A FOREST. 
The history of the life of a forest is a story of the 
help and harm which the trees receive from one another, 
On one side every tree is engaged in a relentless strug- 
gle against its neighbors for light, water, and food, the 
three things trees need most. On the other side, each 
tree is constantly working with all its neighbors, even 
those which stand at some distance, to bring about the 
best condition of the soil and air for the growth and 
fighting power of every other tree, (See Pl. XXIII.) 
A COMMUNITY OF TREES. 
The life of a community of trees is an exceedingly 
interesting one. .A forest tree is in many ways as much 
dependent upon its neighbors for safety and food as are 
the inhabitants of a town upon one another, (See fig. 
41.) The difference is that in a town each citizen has a 
special calling or occupation in which he works for the 
service of the commonwealth, while in the forest every 
tree contributes to the general welfare in nearly all the 
ways in which it is benefited by the community, A 
forest tree helps to protect its neighbors against the 
wind, which might overthrow them, and the sun, which 
is ready to dry up the soil about their roots or to make 
sun cracks in their bark by shining too hotly upon it. 
It enriches the earth in which they stand by the fall of

its leaves and twigs, and aids in keeping the air about 
their crowns, and the soil about their roots, cooler in 
summer and warmer in winter than it would be if each 
tree stood alone. (See Pl. XXIV.) With the others it 
forms a common canopy under which the seedlings of 
all the members of this protective union are sheltered 
in early youth, and through which the beneficent influ-

ence of the forest is preserved and extended far beyond 
the spread of the trees themselves. But while this 
fruitful cooperation exists, there is also present, just 
as in a village or a city, a vigorous strife for the good 
things of life. For a tree the best of these, and often 
the hardest to get, are water for the roots and space and 
light for the crown. In all but very dry places there is

water enough for all the trees, and often more than 
enough, as for example in the Adirondack forest. The 
struggle for space and light is thus more important 
than the struggle for water, and as it takes place above 
ground it is also much more easily observed and stud- 
ied. (See fig. 42 and Pl. XXV.) 
Light and space are of such importance because, as 
we have seen, the leaves 
can not assimilate or di- 
gest food except in the 
presence of light and air. 
The rate at which a tree 
can grow and make new 
wood is decided chietly by 
its ability to assimilate 
and digest plant food. 
This power depends upon 
the number, size, and 
health of the leaves, and 
these in turn upon the

The story of the life of 
a forest crop is then largely an account of the com- 
petition of the trees for light and room, and, although 
the very strength which enables them to carry on 
the fight is a result of their association, still the 
deadly, struggle, in which the victims are many times 
more in number. than those which survive, is apt 
alone to absorb the attention. Yet the mutual help 
of the trees to each other is always going quietly on.

  THE SEVEN AGES OF A 
Every tree continually comforts and 
trees, which are its friendly enemies, 
(See figs. 43, 44.) 
The purpose of the present chapter 
is to follow the progress of a forest 
crop of uniform age from the seed 
through all the suceessive phases of 
its life until itreaches maturity, bears 
seed in its turn, and finally declines 
in fertility and strength until at last 
it passes away and its place is filled 
by a new generation. The life his- 
tory which we are about to follow, 
as it unfolds itself through the course 
of several hundred years, is full of 
struggle and danger in youth, restful 
and dignified in age. The changes 
which pass over it are vast and full 
of the deepest interest, but they are 
very gradual. From beginning to 
end one stage melts insensibly into 
the next. Still, in order to study and 
describe them conveniently, each 
stage must have limits and a name. 
THE SEVEN AGES OF X TREE, 
A very practical way of naming 
and distinguishing trees is the follow- 
ing, which will be used in referring 
to them hereafter in this discussion.

reached a height of 3 feet are seed-

age, if it grew from a seed, is properly called a seedling

THE BEGINNING OF A FOREST CROP. 49 
HOW ‘CHE CROP BEGINS. 
Let us imagine an abundant crop of tree seeds lying 
on the ground in the forest. (See Pl. XXVI.) How 
hey came there does not interest us at present; we 
do not care to know whether they were carried by the 
wind, as often happens with the winged seeds of many 
trees, such as Pines and Maples, or whether the squir-

rels and birds dropped and planted some of them, as 
they frequently do acorns and chestnuts, or whether the 
old trees stood closely about and sowed the seed them- 
selves. We will only suppose them to be all of one kind, 
and to be scattered in a place where the soil, the mois- 
ture, and the light are all just as they should be for 
their successful germination, and afterwards for the

later stages of their lives. Even under the best condi- 
tions a considerable part of the fallen seed may never 
germinate, but in this case we will assume that half of it 
succeeds. (See fig. 46.) 
As each seed of our forest germinates and pushes its 
first-slender rootlet downward into the earth, it has a 
very uncertain hold on life. Even for some time after-

wards the danger from frost, dryness, and excessive 
moisture is very serious indeed, and there are many 
other foes by which the young seedlings may be over- 
come. It sometimes happens that great numbers of 
them: perish in their earliest youth because their roots 
can not reach the soil through the thick dry coating of 
dead leaves which covers it. But our young trees pass

tively little loss, and a plentiful crop of seedlings oceu- 
pies the ground. As yet, however, each little tree 
stands free from those about it. As yet, too, the life 
of the young forest may be threatened or even de- 
stroyed by any one of the enemies already mentioned, 
or it may suffer just as severely if the cover of the 
older trees above it is too dense. In the beginning of 
their lives seedlings often require to be protected by

  the shade of their elders, but if this protection is too 
long continued they suffer for want of light, and are 
either killed outright or live only to drag on stunted 
and unhealthy lives. (See fig. 47.) 
THE FOREST COVER ESTABLISHED. 
The crop which we are following has had a suitable 
proportion of shade and light during its earliest years, 
and the seedlings have spread until their crowns begin 
to meet. Hitherto each little tree has had all the space 
in the air and soil that it needed for the expansion of 
its top and roots. This would have been entirely good, 
except that meanwhile the soil about the trees has been

  52 A PRIMER OF FORESTRY. 
more or less exposed’ to the sun and wind, and so 
has become dryer and less fertile than if it had been 
under cover, and consequently the growth has been 
slow. But now that the crowns are meeting, the situa- 
tion becomes wonderfully changed. The soil begins 
to improve rapidly, because it is protected by the 
cover of the meeting crowns and enriched ‘by the 
leaves and twigs which 
fallfrom them. (See figs. 
48, 49.)

STRUGGLE.

the added vigor which the trees are now helping each 
other to attain comes the most urgent need for rapid 
development, for the decisive struggle is at hand. 
The roots of the young trees contend with each other 
in the soil for moisture and the plant food which it 
contains, while in the air the crowns struggle for 
space and light. The latter is by far the more im- 
portant battle. The victors in it overcome by greater 
rapidity of growth at the ends of the branches, for it 
is by growth there, and there only, that trees increase

in height and spread of crown. Growth in this way 
was going on unchecked among the young trees be- 
fore the crowns met, but now only the upward-grow- 
ing branches can develop freely. The leaves at the 
ends of the side branches have now less room and, above 
all, less light, for they are crowdedeand thrust aside by 
those of the other trees. Very often they are bruised 
by thrashing against 
their neighbors when 
the wind blows, or 
even broken off while 
stili in the bud.

The forest we have been following has now passed 
through the small-sapling stage, and is composed chiefly, 
but not exclusively, of large saplings. Among the over-

Even between the domi-

great differences. In-

going on rapidly among 
these high saplings, and

the next a point is 
reached when the top-

Later on, as we shall see, 
these upper branches lengthen much more slowly, until, 
in standards and veterans, the growth in height gradu- 
ally diminishes, and in very old trees finally ceases 
altogether. 
NATURAL PRUNING. 
While the trees are pushing up most rapidly the side 
branches are most quickly overshaded, and the process 
of natural pruning: goes on with the greatest vigor. 
Natural pruning is the reason why old trees in a dense 
forest have only a small crown high in the air, and why 
their tall, straight trunks are clear of branches to such

a height above the ground. (See figs. 52-56 and PI. 
XXX.) The trunks of trees grown in the open, where 
even the lower limbs have abundance of light, are 
branched either quite to the ground or to within a short 
distance of it. But in the 
forest not only are the lower 
side branches continually 
dying for want of light, but 
the tree rids itself of them 
after they are dead and so 
frees its trunk from them en- 
tirely. When a branch dies 
the annual layer of new wood 
is no longer deposited upon 
it. Consequently the dead 
branch, where it is inserted 
in the tree, makes a little 
hole in the first coat of living 
tissue formed over the live 
wood after its death. The 
edges of this hole make a 
sort of collar about the base [|

are found in boards, are the marks left in the trunk 
by branches which have disappeared.

are making clean trunks

height growth they are 
also making their great-

of growth generally eul-

there is any difference,

For a time these: three 
kinds of growth keep on 
at the same rate as in the 
past, but afterwards all

Growth in diameter, and 
in volume also, if the

until extreme old age, but 
height growth sinks very 
low while the two others 
are still strong. For 
many years before this

  THE END OF THE STRUGGLE, 61 
without the means of overtopping one another. When 
the end of the period of principal height growth is 
reached the trees are interfering with each other very 
little, and the struggle for life begins again in a ditffer- 
ent way. As the principal height growth ceases, and 
the tops no longer shoot up rapidly above the side 
branches, the crowns lose their 
pointed shape and become com- 
paratively flat. (See figs. 57, 58.) 
The chief reason why trees stop 
growing in height is that they are 
not able to keep the upper parts 
of their crowns properly supplied 
with water above a certain dis- 
tance from the ground. ‘This 
distance varies in different kinds 
of trees, and with the health and 
vigor of the tree in each species, 
but there is a limit in every case 
above which the water does not 
reach. The power of the pumping machinery, more than 
any other quality, determines the height of the tree.

than a flat one. 
THE END OF THE STRUGGLE, 
Now that the tree can no longer expand at the top, 
it must either suffer a great loss in the number of its 
leaves or be able to spread at the sides; for it is clear 
that not nearly so many leaves can be exposed to the 
light in the flattened crown as in the pointed one, just 
as a pointed roof has more surface than a flat one. 
(See fig. 59.) It is just at this time, too, that the trees 
begin to bear seed most abundantly, and it is of the 
greatest importance to each tree that its digestive appa-

ratusin the leaves should be able to furnish a large sup- 
ply of digested food. Consequently the struggle for 
space is fiercely renewed, only now the trees no longer 
attempt to overtop one another, having lost the power, 
but to crowd one another away at the sides, (See fig. 60.) 
The whole forest might suffer severely at this point from 
a deadlock such as sometimes happens in early youth

very humerous competitors they have shown themselves 
to be the best adapted to their surroundings. (See fig. 
61 and Pl. XXXT.) 
Natural selection has made it clear that these are the 
best trees for the place. These are also the trees which 
bear the seed whence the younger generations spring. 
Their offspring will inherit their fitness to a greater or 
less degree, and in their turn will be subjected to the

same rigorous test, by which only the best are allowed 
to reach maturity. Under this sifting out of the weak 
and the unfit, our native trees have been prepared, 
through thousands of generations, to meet the condi- 
tions under which they must live. This is why they 
are so much more apt to succeed than species from 
abroad, which have not been fitted for our climate and 
soil by natural selection. 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
   
      
64 A PRIMER OF FORESTRY. 
The forest which we saw first in the seed has new 
passed through all the more vigorous and active stages 
of its life. The trees have become standards and vet- 
erans, and large enough to be valuable for lumber. 
Rapid growth in height has long been at an end, diam- 
eter growth is slow, and the forest as a whole is increas- 
ing very little in volume as time goes on. The trees 
are ripe for the harvest. 
Out of the many things which might happen to our 
mature forest we will only consider three. 
DEATH FROM WEAKNESS AND DECAY. 
In the first place, we will suppose that it stands un- 
touched until, like the trees of the virgin forest, it meets 
its death from weakness and decay. 
The trees of the mature primeval forest live on, if no 
accidents intervene, almost at peace among themselves. 
At length all conflict between them ends. The whole 
power of each tree is strained in a new struggle against 
death, until at last it fails. One by one the old trees 
disappear. But long before they go, the forerunners of 
anew generation have sprung up wherever light came 
in between their isolated crowns. As the old trees 
fall, with intervals, often of many years, between their 
deaths, young growth of various ages rises to take their 
place, and when the last of the old forest has vanished 
there may be differences of a hundred years among 
the young trees which succeed it. (See Pl. XXXII.) 
An eyen-aged crop of considerable extent, such as we 
have been considering, is not usual in the virgin forest, 
where trees of very different ages grow side by side, 
and when it does occur, the next generation is far less 
uniform. The forest whose history has just been sketched

was chosen, not because it represents the most common 
type of natural forest, but because it illustrates better 
than any other the life and progress of forest growth. 
(See Pl. XX XIII.) 
The wood of a tree which dies in the forest is almost 
wholly wasted. For a time the rotting trunk may serve 
to retain moisture, but there is little use for the carbon, 
oxygen, and hydro- 
gen which make up 
itsgreaterpart. The 
mineral constituents 
alone form a useful 
fertilizer, but most 
often there is al- 
ready an abundance 
of similar material 
inthesoil. Notonly

turity it has done lit- , 
tle more than intercept, to no good purpose, the light 
which would otherwise have given vitality to a valuable 
crop of younger trees. It is only when the ripe wood 
is harvested properly and in time that the forest attains 
its highest usefulness. 
    
DESTRUCTIVE LUMBERING. 
A second thing which may happen to a forest is to be 
cut down without care for the future. The yield of a 
forest lumbered in the usual way is more or less thor- 
oughly harvested, it is true, but at an enormous cost to 
the forest. Ordinary lumbering injures or destroys the 
young growth, both in the present and for the future,  
-P-A-G-E-134
  66 A PRIMER OF FORESTRY. 
provokes and feeds fires, and does harm of many other 
kinds. In many eases its result is to annihilate the 
productive capacity of forest land for tens or scores of 
years to come. (See fig. 62 and Pl. XXXIV.) 
CONSERVATIVE LUMBERING. 
The methods of forestry,on the other hand, maintain 
and increase both the productiveness and the capital 
value of forest land; harvest the yield far more com- 
pletely than ordinary lumbering, although less rapidly; 
prepare for, encourage, and preserve the young growth; 
tend to keep out fires; and in general draw from the 
forest, while protecting it, the best return which it is 
eapable of giving. 
The application of these methods is the third possi- 
bility for the crop just described, There are still many 
places in the United States where transportation is so 
costly that, as yet, forestry will not pay from a business 
point of view. Elsewhere right forest management is 
the wisest, safest, and most satisfactory way of dealing 
with the forest. It is briefly described in Part II of 
this primer,

  CHAPTER IV. 
ENEMIES OF THE FOREST. 
The forest is threatened by many enemies, of which 
fire and reckless lumbering are the worst. In the 
United States sheep grazing and wind come next. Cat- 
tle and horses do much less damage than sheep, and 
snow break is less costly than windfall. Landslides, 
floods, insects, and fungi are sometimes very harmful. 
In certain situations numbers of trees are killed by light- 
ning, which has also been known to set the woods on 
fire, and the forest is attacked in many other ways. 
For example, birds and squirrels often prevent young 
growth by devouring great quantities of nuts and other 
seeds, while porcupines and mice frequently kill young 
trees by gnawing away their bark. 
MAN AND NATURE IN THE FOREST. 
Most of these foes may be called natural enemies, for 
they would injure the forest to a greater or less extent 
if the action of man were altogether removed. Wild 
animals would take the place of domestic sheep and 
cattle to some degree, and fire, wind, and insects would 
still attack the forest. But many of the most serious 
dangers to the forest are of human origin. Such are 
destructive lumbering, and excessive taxation on forest 
Jands, to which much bad lumbering is directly due. 
So high are these taxes, for in many cases they amount 
to 5 or even 6 per cent yearly on the market value of

  68 A PRIMER OF FORESTRY. 
the forests, that the owners can not afford to pay 
them and hold their lands. Consequently they are 
forced to cut or sell their timber in haste and with- 
out regard to the future. When the timber is gone 
the owners refuse to pay taxes any longer, and the 
devastated lands revert to the State. Many thou- 
sand square miles of forest have been ruined by reck-

less lumbering because heavy taxes forced the owners 
to realize quickly and once for all upon their forest land, 
instead of cutting it in a way to insure valuable future 
crops. For the same reason many counties are now 
poor that might, with reasonable taxation of timber 
land, have been flourishing and rich. 
A short description of destructive lumbering will be

found in Part IL of this primer, together with some 
consideration of the most effective remedy, which is 
found in conservative ways of handling the forest, 
that is, in forest management. 
GRAZING IN THE FOREST,

depends on the age and character of the woods as well 
as upon the kind of animals that graze. A young fores 
is always more exposed to such injury than an old one, 
and steep slopes are more subject to damage than more 
level ground. Whether the young trees. are conifers,

being eaten, or broadleaf trees, and so more likely to 
be devoured, they should be protected from pasturing 
animals until they are large enough to be out of danger. 
GRAZING AND FIRE. 
Grazing in the forest does harm in three ways. First, 
it is a fertile cause of forest fires. (See figs. 64-66 and. 
Pl. XXXV.) Burning the soil cover of grass and other

plants improves the grazing, either permanently, by 
destroying the forest and so extending the area of pas- 
turage, or temporarily, by improving the quality of the 
feed. For one or the other of these objects, but chiefly 
for the latter, vast areas are annually burned over in 
nearly every part of the United States where trees grow. 
The great majority of these fires do not kill the old 
trees, but the harm they do the forest and, eventually,

  TRAMPLING BY SHEEP. TL 
the fodder plants themselves, is very serious indeed. 
The sheep men of the West are commonly accused of 
setting many forest fires to improve the grazing, and 
they are also vigorously defended from this charge. 
But the fact remains that large areas where sheep now 
graze would be covered with forests except for the 
action of more or less recent fires. 
    
      
Fig. 66.—Cattle in the Bighorn Forest Reserve, Wyoming. 
TRAMPLING. 
Trampling is the second way in which grazing ani- 
mals injure the forest. Cattle and horses do compara- 
tively little harm, although their hoofs compact the soil 
and often tear loose the slender rootlets of small trees. 
Sheep, on the contrary, are exceedingly harmful, espe- 
cially on steep slopes and where the soil is loose. In 
such places their small, sharp hoofs cut and powder the 
soil, break and overthrow the young trees, and often 
destroy promising young forests altogether. (See Pls.
-P-A-G-E-146
  72 A PRIMER OF FORESTRY. 
XXXVI, XXXVII, XXXVIII.) In many places the 
efiect of the trampling is to destroy the forest floor and 
to interfere very seriously with the flow of streams. In 
the Alps of southern France sheep grazing led to the 
destruction, first, of the mountain forests, and then of 
the grass which; had replaced them, and thus left the 
soil fully exposed to the rain. Great floods followed, 
beds of barren stones were spread over the fertile fields 
by the force of the water, and many rich valleys were 
almost or altogether depopulated. Besides the loss 
occasioned in this way, it has cost the French people 
tens of millions of dollars to repair the damage begun 
by the sheep, and the task is not yet finished. The loss 
to the nation is enormously greater than any gain from 
the mountain pastures could have been, and even the 
sheep owners themselves, for whose profit the damage 
was done, were losers in the end, for their industry in 
that region was utterly destroyed. 
BROWSING. 
The third way in which grazing animals injure the 
forest is by feeding on the young trees, In the western 
part of the United States, where most of the forests 
are evergreen, this is far less important than the dam- 
age from either fire or trampling, for sheep and other 
animals seldom eat young conifers if they can get other 
food.. Even where broadleaf trees prevail browsing 
rarely leads tothe destruction of any forest, although 
it commonly results in scanty young. growth, often 
maimed and unsound as well. Goats are especially 
harmful, and where they abound the healthy reprodue- 
tion of broadleaf trees is practically impossible. In 
the United States they are fortunately not common. 
Cattle devour tender young shoots and branches in vast

quantities, often living for months on little else, and 
sheep are destructive in the same way. Hogs also find 
a living in the forest, but they are less harmful, 
because a large part of their food consists of seeds and 
nuts. East of the Great Plains very large numbers of 
cattle and hogs are turned into the woods, but sheep 
grazing in the forest is most widely developed in the 
West, and especially in California, where it should be

it should be regulated and restricted, and in some 
interior regions, like Wyoming and New Mexico, where 
it should be rigidly excluded from all steep mountain 
regions, and carefully regulated on more level ground.

Insects are constantly injuring the forest, just as year 
by year they bring loss to the farm. Occasionally their

which afterwards develops into a sawfly, has since 1882

such as the Larch and

likely to suffer from the 
attacks of insects than 
broadleaf trees. About

that spores will find lodgment and breed disease. This

is a strong reason why all wounds, such as those made 
in pruning, should be covered with some substance like 
paint or tar to exclude the air and the spores it carries. 
WIND IN THE FOREST. 
The effect of wind in the virgin forest is not wholly 
injurious. Although in many regions it overthrows 
great numbers of old trees, their removal is usually fol-

lowed by a vigorous young growth where the old trees 
stood. (See Pl. XX XIX.) In this way the wind helps to 
keep the forest full of young and healthy trees. But it 
also breaks and blows down great numbers of useful 
growing members of the forest. Much of this windfall 
occurs among shallow-rooted trees, or where the ground 
is soft because soaked with water, or where the trees 
have been weakened by unsoundness or fire. Some
-P-A-G-E-154
76 A PRIMER OF FORESTRY. 
storms are strong enough to break the trees they can 
not overthrow. Damage from wind is not uncommon 
in many parts of the United States, and in places the 
loss from itis very serious. 
(See figs. 69, 70.) Near 
the town of High Springs, 
for example, in Alachua 
County, Fla., in a region 
very subject to such acvi- 
dents, there is a tract of 
many square miles, once

SNOW IN THE FOREST, 
Snow often loads down, breaks, and crushes tall 
young trees, especially if wet snow falls heavily be- 
fore the broadleaf trees have shed their foliage in the 
fall. Such injury is difficult to guard against, but it 
is well to know that very slim, tall trees suffer more 
than those whose growth in diameter and height have

kept better pace with each other, (See figs. 71, 72, and 
Pl. XL.) In many regions snow is so useful in protect- 
ing the soil and the young trees that the harm it does 
is quite overbalanced by its benefits. 
FOREST VIRES. 
Of all the foes which attack the woodlands of North 
America no other is so terrible as fire. J orest fires 
spring from many differ- 
entcauses. They are often 
kindled alongrailroads by 
sparks from the locomo- 
tives. Carelessness is re- 
sponsible for many fires. 
Settlersand farmers clear- 
ing land or burning grass 
and brush often allow the 
fire to escape into the 
woods. (See fig. 73.)

duff far beyond his reach, 
to smolder for days, or weeks, and perhaps to break 
out as a destructive fire long after he is gone. Many 
fires are set for malice or revenge, and the forest is often 
burned over by huckleberry pickers to increase the next 
season’s growth of berries, or by the owners of cattle 
or sheep to make better pasture for their herds.

There is danger from forest fires in the dry portions 
of, the spring -and summer, but those which do most 
harm usually occur in the fall. At whatever time of 
the year they appear, their destructive power depends 
very much on the wind. They can not travel against 
it except when burning up hill, and not even then if 
the wind is strong. The wind may give them strength

inflammable forests, or it may extinguish the fiercest 
fire in a short time by turning it back over its path, 
where there is nothing left'to burn. In fighting forest

its direction must be carefully watched. A sudden

a new direction and perhaps threaten the lives of the 
men at work by driving it suddenly down upon them. 
HISTORIC FOREST FIRES. 
‘When all the conditions are favorable, forest fires 
sometimes reach gigantic proportions. A few such 
fires have attained historic importance. One of these 
is the Miramichi fire of 1825. It began its greatest

7 of that year, at a place about 60 miles above the town 
of Newcastle, on the Miramichi River, in New Bruns- 
wick. Before 10 o'clock at night it was 20 miles below 
Newcastle. In nine hours it had destroyed a belt of 
forest 80 miles long and 25 miles wide. Over more than 
two and a half million acres almost every living thing 
was killed. Even the fish were afterwards found dead 
in heaps on the river banks. Five hundred and ninety 
buildings were burned, and a number of towns, includ-

neatly a thousand head of.stock. The loss from the 
Miramichi fire is estimated at $300,000, not including 
the value of the timber.

severe than the Miramichi. It covered an area of over

1894. While the area burned over was less than in 
some other great fires, the loss of life and property was 
very heavy. Hinckley and six other towns were de- 
stroyed, about 500 lives were lost, more than 2,000 per- 
sons were left destitute, and the estimated loss in prop- 
erty of various kinds was $25,000,000. Except for the 
heroic conduct of loconiotive engineers and other rail- 
road men the loss of life would have been far greater. 
This fire was all the more deplorable, because it was 
wholly unnecessary. For many days before the high 
wind came and drove it into uncontrollable fury, it was 
burning slowly close to the town of Hinckley, and 
could have been put out. 
MEANS OF DEFE    
The means of fighting forest fires are not everywhere 
the same, for they burn in many different ways; but 
in every case the best time to fight a fire is at the begin- 
ning, before it has had time to spread. A delay of even 
a very few minutes may permit a fire that at first could 
easily have been extinguished to gather headway and 
get altogether beyond control. 
‘When there is but a thin covering of leaves and other 
waste on the ground a fire usually can not burn very 
hotly or move with much speed. The fires in most 
hardwood forests are of this kind. They seldom kill 
large trees, but they destroy seedlings and saplings 
and kill the bark of older trees in places near the 
ground. The hollows at the foot of old Chestnuts and 
other large trees are often the results of these fires, 
which occur again and again, and so enlarge the wounds 
instead of allowing them to heal. (See Pl. XLIL.) 
Moderate fires also occur in dense coniferous forests

when only the top of a thick layer of duff is dry enough 
to burn. The heat may not be great enough to kill any 
ut’ the smallest and tenderest young trees, but that 
does not mean that such fires dono harm. The future 
of the forest depends on just such young growth, and 
whenever the forest floor, which is so necessary both 
to the trees and for the 
water supply, is injured or 
destroyed by fire, the for- 
est suffers harm.   
SURFACE FIRES. 
Surface fires may be 
checked if they are feeble 
by beating them out with 
green branches, or by rak-

hot.one if there is no wind. Dirt or sand thrown on a 
burning fire is one of the best of all means for putting 
it out. (See.fig. 79.) 
In dense forests with a heavy forest floor, fires are 
often hot enough not only to kill the standing timber, 
but to consume the ‘trunks and-branches altogether, 
and-even to follow the roots far down into the ground. 
In forests of this kind fire spreads easily, creeping along 
on the surface or through the duff or under the bark

of rotting fallen trees. (See Pl. XLUI.) In the same 
way it climbs dead standing trees, and breaks out in 
bursts of flame high in the air. Dead trees help pow- 
erfully to spread a fire, for in high winds loose pieces of 
their burning bark are carried to almost incredible dis- 
tances, and drop into the dry forest far ahead, while in 
calm weather they scatter 
burning fragments all 
about them when they 
fall. (See fig. 80.) 
GROUND FIRES. 
‘When the duff is very

again long after it is be- 
lieved to be entirely extinct. Fires which thus burn into 
the ground can sometimes be checked only by digging 
a trench through the layer of decaying wood and other 
vegetable matter to the mineral soil beneath. Ground 
fires usually burn much more slowly than surface fires, 
but they are exceptionally long lived, and very hard to 
put ont. It is of the first importance to attack such 
fires quickly, before they have had time to burrow far

beneath the surface of the ground. Surface fires are 
usually far less troublesome, but in either case fires 
which kill the trees are generally repeated again and 
again until the dead timber is consumed. (See fig. 81 
and Pls, XLIV, XLV, XLVI, XLVIL.) 
BACK-FIRING. 
The most dangerous and destructive forest fires are 
those which run both along the ground and in the tops

of the trees. When-a fire becomes intensely hot on the 
ground it may run up the bark, especially if the trees 
are conifers, and burn in the crowns. Such firesare the 
fiercest and most destructive of all. Traveling some- 
times faster than a man can run, they consume enor- 
mous quantities of valuable timber, burn fences, build- 
ings, and domestic animals, and endanger or even 
destroy human lives. They can be checked only by

rain or change of wind, or by meeting some barrier 
which they can not pass. <A barrier of this kind is often 
made by starting another fire some distance ahead 
of the principal one. 
This back-fire, as it is 
called, must be al- 
lowed to burn only 
against the wind and 
toward the main fire, 
so that when the two 
fires meet both must 
go out for lack of fuel.

use is caused by persons who, in excitement or fright,

light them at the wrong time or in the wrong place. 
Still, there is no other means of fighting fires so power- 
ful, and none so effective when rightly used. 
FIRE LINES. 
Fire lines—strips kept free from all inflammable 
material by burning or otherwise—are very useful in 
checking small fires and of great value as lines of defense 
in fighting large ones. (See fig. 83.) They are also 
very effective in keeping fires out of the woods, as, for 
example, along railroad tracks. But without men to 
do the fighting they are of as little use against really 
dangerous fires as forts without soldiers against invad- 
ing armies.

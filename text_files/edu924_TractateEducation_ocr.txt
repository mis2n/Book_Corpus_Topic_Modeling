PREFACE. 
Tus edition of Milton’s T'ractate of Education has 
been prepared for those who desire to study the 
language and style as well as the matter of the 
little book—for students of English as well as for 
educators. I hope it will not be thought that 
the original is hidden under the weight of com- 
mentary. I cannot place my hand upon my 
heart and say that there is nothing in notes or 
introduction which is not absolutely necessary for 
the understanding of the text; but I have tried 
on the one hand not to leave difficulties unex- 
plained, and on the other to make all additional 
matter interesting. 
Professor Masson’s great book has been of chief 
assistance to me; and next fe that, Professor . Y v

INTRODUCTION. 
I. MILTON'S EARLY LIFE. 
Ir cannot be necessary to prefix a life of Milton 
to every edition of every separate work by him. 
For there are many lives of Milton, and lives 
written on every scale, from the longest and most 
complete biography in the language, down to short 
- accounts that cover only a few pages. All, whose 
literary studies have led them over the same 
ground, must value the accuracy and fulness of 
Professor David Masson’s great work, the whole 
title of which is “The Life of John Milton: 
narrated in connection with the Political, Ecclesi- 
astical, and Literary History of his Time.” Milton, 
it is true, seems sometimes overlaid with the 
general history: but the book remains a splendid 
monument to Milton’s memory; all the facts are 
to be found there narrated in remarkable fulness ; 
whilst, fortunately, within the last few months, a 
careful index volume has been given to the world. 
This is not .the place to review the various short 
accounts of Milton’s life. The student can easily

select one of them and gather from it the main 
facts. 
If, however, a full account of Milton’s life be 
not necessary here, it is yet very desirable for 
any one embarking on the study of a book like 
this Tractate, that he should ascertain the circum- 
stances under which the book was written, the 
period of the author’s life, and his other writings 
of that period. 
Milton’s life may be divided into three parts. 
here was an early spring time of poetry and a 
late harvest of poetry, divided by a middle life 
of prose. The first period containing the “Hymn 
on the Morning of Christ’s Nativity,” “L’Allegro,” 
“Tl Penseroso,” “ Arcades,” “Comus” and “ Lycidas.” 
The character of these poems is quite different from 
that of “Paradise Lost,” “Paradise Regained,” and 
“Samson Agonistes.” These long epic poems, and 
‘the drama cast in a Greek mould, are perhaps 
the poems upon which Milton’s fame chiefly 
depends. Widely different as the two poetic 
periods of Milton’s life are, they are separated 
from each other by a long interval which differs 
still more from both. During it the only element 
of the poet is to be found in seventeen sonnets, 
often very personal, and rich in: autobiographical 
interest. The three periods of Milton’s life may 
be thus named:

INTRODUCTION, xi 
Two important years in English History may be 
“selected as dividing off these periods from each 
other—1640, the date of the meeting of the Long 
Parliament, and 1660, the date of the Restoration. 
Born in December, 1608, Milton was nearly thirty- 
two when this central period began, and in his 
fifty-second year when it ended. 
The “Tractate.of Education” was published in 
June, 1644, when Milton’s age was thirty-five 
and a half yA very brief account may be given 
of his édtlier years, gathering fulness as we near 
the date of the Tractate. 
Born in London, Milton was sent before the 
age of eleven as a day boy to the chief London 
school, St. Paul’s, then situated at the east end 
of St. Paul’s churchyard. ‘This school had been 
founded a century earlier by Dean Colet, who, 
the great friend of Erasmus and of Sir Thomas 
More, was one of the first after the revival of 
. letters to introduce the genuine study of the 
classics into England. The education which Milton 
there received was purely classical, but of a high 
order. Its influence pervades his whole life. He 
composed in Latin as easily as in English, whether 
in prose or in verse. Milton was a little over| 
sixteen when he passed to Christ’s College, Cam-/ 
bridge. Seven years did he spend at Cambridge, 
remaining three years after taking his B.A. degree; 
but even when he was admitted to the M.A. degree, 
he did not regard himself as thoroughly equipped 
for the battle of life, . He retired to a country

xii MILTON'S OF EDUCATION. 
village, to which his father had betaken himself for 
the evening of his life, Horton, in the part of Buck- 
inghamshire nearest London, and there he remained 
for a period of nearly six years. 
A few months before Milton left Cambridge, 
a friend, older than himself, remonstrated with 
him, fearing lest he was turning dilettante, and 
advised him to accept some serious work in life. 
To this remonstrance Milton wrote a careful reply 
which is extant, enclosing in the letter the well- 
known sonnet: “On his being arrived to the age 
of Twenty-three.” The gist of the letter lies in 
this sentence: “This very consideration of that 
great commandment [not to hide the talent] does 
not press forward, as so many do, to undergo, 
but keeps off, with a sacred reverence and religious 
advisement how best. to undergo—not taking 
thought of being late, so it give advantage to be 
more jit; for those that were latest lost nothing 
when ‘the master of the vineyard came to give 
each one his hire.” Miltn Sesined tha at_his.-pre-

INTRODUCTION. xiii 
joined with the strong propensity of nature, I 
might perhaps leave something so written to after 
times as they should not willingly let it die.” 
In one of in pamphlets’ he gives us. some 
picttre of his life at Horton. The following is 
a transtation: 
“At my father’s country residence, whither he 
had retired to pass his old age, I, in the most 
perfect leisure, had my time entirely free for going 
through the Greek and Latin writers; not but 
that sometimes I exchanged the country for the 
town, either for the purpose of buying books, 
or for that of learning something new in mathe- 
matics or in music, in which I then delighted.” 2 
Near the end of the “Tractate of Education,” 
Milton recommends that. foreign travel should be 
postponed until education is completed, and this 
completion for the ordinary man he Places at “three 
or four and and twenty years of age”—two or three 
years rs if-will_he noted after. leaving the “ Academy.” 
But this prolonged study..at. Horton. was for Milton 
1“ Defensio Secunda.” 
2These are the words: “evolvendis Grecis Latinisque 
scriptoribus summum per otium totus vacare.” 
Translated in St. John’s edition: “I enjoyed an interval — 
of uninterrupted leisure, which I entirely devoted to the 
perusal of the Greek and Latin Classics.” 
Translated by Masson : “I, with every advantage of leisure, 
spent a complete holiday in turning over the Greek and 
Latin writers.” This surely gives too modern a meaning 
to vacare, and hardly brings out the full force of the first 
syllable of evolvendis, which implies thoroughness.    
 
-P-A-G-E-15
xiv MILTON'S OF EDUCATION. 
a continuation of his education, and not until the 
close of it was he prepared to make the grand tour., 
Here the extract from the Latin pamphlet may 
be continued: “Having passed five years in this 
manner (studying at Horton), after my mother’s 
death, I, being desirous of seeing foreign lands, and 
especially Italy, went abroad with one servant, 
having by entreaty obtained my father’s consent.” 
In these days of easy travel, it is of interest 
to follow Milton’s itinerary. First, his travels took 
him to Paris, where he was introduced_to Hugo Grotius, author of the famous treatise “De Jure 
Pacis et Belli,” the foundation of International Law. 
Thence he went south through Provence’ to Italy, 
which he entered at Nice, then, for many years 
later, Italian and not French. From Nice he sailed 
by packet to Genoa, thence to Leghorn, from which 
place he went on to Pisa and Florence. In this 
city he stayed two happy months, making, as he 
says, the acquaintance of “many truly noble and 
learnéd men.” Amongst others, he “visited the 
famous Galileo, grown old a prisoner to the Inquisi- 
tion for thinking in Astronomy otherwise than the 
Franciscan and Dominican licensers thought.”" A   
.similar’ stay of two months in Rome followed, 
where Milton was delighted with the sight of the 
antiquities, but hostile to the Catholicism that he 
saw. Naples followed after Rome, and from Naples 
Milton began to retrace his steps, although he had 
previously made up his mind to travel further.

“When I was desirous to cross into Sicily and 
Greece, the sad news of civil war coming from 
England called me back, for I considered it dis- 
graceful that, while my fellow-countrymen were 
| fighting at home for liberty, I should be travelling 
abroad at ease for intellectual purposes.” 
Wisely, however, Milton varied his return 
journey, stopping again for a while at Rome and 
Florence, then moving by Bologna to Venice. 
Thence he shipped home the books, especially 
music books, that he had collected in Italy. Tra- 
velling by Verona and Milan, he crossed the Alps, 
and went by Lake Leman to Geneva, the head- 
quarters of Calvinism, with which then Milton was 
by no means out of sympathy, and so by Paris 
homeward, nde Hie aie eval not beyond

contact with Italian | Catholicism or_ Ttalianm ‘morals. 
Dr. Johnson, in his “ Life of Milton,” cannot. Te- 
frain from Tookitig “with ‘some degree of merriment 
on great promisés~and ‘sriall performance, on the 
man who hastens home, because his countrymen 
are contending for their liberty, and, when he 
reaches the scene of action, vapours away his 
patriotigm in a private boarding-school.” The fair 
comment on this is that Milton made no great 
promises, ses, that he never seems to have intended to 
_ stand fo for Parliament -or -“fo_-accept..a_military- ‘com- 
mand, and that his intention probably always was

his ‘pen. Herein _it maybe “conjectured—that, per- 
haps, Dr. Johnson. had. been better .pleased—had 
Milton’s_ performance. been. even. smaller. 
‘When Milton returned from abroad in August, 
1639, and soon afterwards became a schoolmaster, 
he did not find civil war in England, but the 
events were in full course that led to the great 
‘Rebellion, It was yet three years before the Civil 
‘War broke out, but the minds of men were already 
being prepared for resistance to the royal authority. 
In Scotland, indeed, the Rebellion had begun, and 
it was probably news of that outbreak which had 
reached Milton at Naples. The introduction of the 
new Prayer Book into the Scottish churches had 
first led to a rioting. Then the General Assembly 
had met at Glasgow, had repudiated. the authority 
of the King, “and had abolished Episcopacy. It seemed not improbable that the example of Scot- 
land would be followed in England ; but the English, 
being more divided in opinion, were more slow to 
move, and were anxious to try gentler means first. 
. King Charles advanced against the Scotch, but his 
army was only half-hearted in his cause, and with 
such soldiers it was impossible to win. Needing 
supplies, the king called Parliament together, 
‘though it had not met for eleven ‘years. The 
Commons, however, were not in a mood to grant 
supplies unless grievances were redressed, and after 
a session of ohly twenty-three days the House was 
dissolved. Ever since that Parliament has been

the Scots invaded England,.the English. would. not 
fight them, and the stateof the.country at. length 
compelled King arles to call Parliament. once 
moré © together.” “In November, 1640, the Long 
Parliament met, and was able to insist on the 
redress of grievances. This the Commons obtained 
before they would vote sufficient supplies for the 
payment of the Scottish army. The struggle be- 
tween the King and the Commons continued, until 
it was evident that peace could no longer be main- 
tained. Still there was delay. arly in the year 
1642 King Charles entered the Ho f Com- 
mons in person, with armed men attend g on him, 
in order to seize five leaders of | the. Opposition. 
They took refuge in the city which protected them. 
Even then Charles did not set up his standard 
until near the end of August, 1642, and the first 
battle, that at Edgehill, was not fought for two 
more months. For the first year the King gained . 
ground. Then. in the opposite camp Cromwell’s 
views began to prevail, and he was able first. to 
inspire his.Ironsides, and then to form an army 
on similar principles. This was called the “New 
Model.” With this new instrument it was not 
difficult. .to-heat..the--Royalists. 
In all this contest Milton’s sympathies were 
strongly with the Houses and against the King. 
Wonder has been expressed that when the war 
broke out he did not take up arms. He was a 
skilful fencer, and, as can be shown from passages

of drill and the military art. In the Tractate he

Whatever be the reason, however, Milton did not — 
join thé army. He probably felt his best weapon 
was the pen, and this he used, and was 3 ready to” 
usé,on—behalf of liberty. During this. central 
period of his life, he was at first a schoolmaster, 
and ‘afterwards. Latin Secretary to the Common- 
: wealth, a position nearly answering, though not 
in importance, to that. of Secretary for. Foreign 
Affairs, Corres; spondence 1 with foreign Governments 
was “carried on in Latin, and _Cromwell’s Govern- 
ment was able to secure the services of the best 
Latin scholar in England. It may fairly be said 
that Milton wi the greatest man that ever was~a 
schoolmaster—as a man the very head and front 
of the profession. In reading the Tractate, it 
should be remembered that it was not written by a 
theorist, but by a man with practical school experi- 
ence, though his school was never large, and it 
might be contended that Milton was rather a tutor, 
as the modern phrase runs, than a schoolmaster. 
But all the time Milton was a pamphleteer. 
He wrote twenty-five pamphlets—four. in—Latin, 
and the rest in. English. The Latin pamphlets fall in the latter half ofthe. period, . and, were 
intended to vindicate. England in the eyes of. 
foreign countries, especially for the treatment of 
Charles I. There is always that distinction be- 
tween Milton’s Latin and English. Latin is for

various questions of the day. The most famous of 
tem 3s the, “ Areopagitica,” which, tinder the form 
of a speech, is a treatise in favour of the “ liberty 
of “unlicensed d printing,” or, in modern _parlan 
the “ * freedom. of. the press” This; with the pam- 
phiets. or on divorce, was the chief Work of the. very

his fame, it was not his first. He began upon 
ecclesiastical questions, the religious aspect of the

Of the central period of Milton’s life two very 
different views are taken. - Some regret that 
Milton the poet was ever anything else than a poet. . 
They hold.that the ideal life for a poet is apart 
from men, that connection with the business of life,

especially if it involves the maintenance of strong 
opinions by taking a side, is a defilement of the 
poet’s singing robes. They wish that Milton could 
have continued to lead a life of retirement in shel- 
tered seclusion like that of Horton,—could_have led 
such a 8 life as that of Wordsworth and of Tennyson. 
Others hold that the immersion in public affairs 
was necessary for Milton; that had he been a 
mere scholar and a mere poet, he would have been 
less great; as a poet, because he would have been 
less the man: indeed, as it has been But, fet that

those who are in sympathy, or at. least in partial 
sympathy, with Milton's cause. An 
Milton's cause? In a single word, liberty. His 
political and his religious sentiments may be 
summed up in that single word. He_was_apposed

“He who would not be frustrate of his hope 
to write well hereafter in laudable things, ought 
himself to be a true poem—that is, a composition 
and pattern of the best and honourablest things.” 
That is a side of Milton’s character which should 
not be forgotten by those who think that in his 
doctrine of divorce he carried too far the principle 
of liberty in a matter which affects the foundations 
‘ morality. 
Milton’s interest in public affairs is clearly shown 
(in the Tractate. Short though it is, originally 
but eight quarto pages, it contains several allusions 
not specially connected with the subject of eduea- 
tion. The military nature of. the exercise re-

War Was, “actually goimg on when the Tractate 
was “written and published, Milton is evidently 
impatient with the leaders on hi his own s own side. . Near 
the end there is an allusion to 0 Essex. “ Since 
the days of Nicias no general at the same time 
so devoted, so incompetent, and so self-satisfied 
had been placed at the head of an army.”! This 
is the verdict of an impartial modern historian on 
Essex. Milton’s view of. him.was, that he lacked 
“just and wise ; discipline, ” and that he could not 
prevent his colonels cheating him as to the wages 
and number of their men. His incompetence was 
due to the fact that he had not “that knowledge 
which belongs to good governors” [p. 23} In 
1§. R. Gardiner, “Great Civil War,” vol. i, p. 465.

another place Milton is laying down the doctrine 
that every man should know something of medicine. 
With such knewledge-a commander would “not, let. 
the healthy. and stout, bodies of young men rot 
away.” This is also glancing [p. 14] at Essex, 
whose army. was much wasted by sickness.dyxing 
“the twelve months before the appearance of the 
Tractate. Milton thinks Essex_could have pre- 
vented this. As a strong argument that his 
students should be taught. politics, Milton. “urges 
[p. 16] that: “they would not then be “such poor, 
shaken, uncertain reeds, of such _a- tottering, con- 
science. as..many-..of.aur...great- Counsellors have 
lately. shown.themselves.” That is a direct allusion 
to the political world around him;.and when speak- 
‘ing of writing and composition, he makes a similar 
slap at the preachers [p. 19], who had evidently 
often sorely tried his. patience, but it may be 
doubtful whether of patience he had any great 
store. Once more [p. 8], Milton points his hatred 
of tyranny by allusions to political life as he had 
known it.

IEL CRITICISMS. 
Upon the scheme of education which Milton 
sets forth the following comments, not original, but 
‘gathered from various quarters, may be made. 
1. Notice its limits. It is for one sex only. 
Milton had nothing to say on the higher education 
of women. Secondly, it is for one class only—the 
sons of gentlemen. Milton has no proposals for 
the general education of the people. His scheme 
is for “our noble and our gentle youth” (p. 19, 
1, 23), those who will hereafter be commanders 
(p. 23). 2. Notice the quantity to be learnt. He legis- 
lates, it has been said, “for a college of Miltons,” 
The boys of his academy must certainly have larger 
- capacity of brain and more extensive memory than 
ordinary boys. He says that as much Latin and 
Greek would be learnt “easily and delightfully in 
one year” as in his time seven or eight years were 
spent over (p. 5). But he is by no means explicit 
as to the means by which this particular change is | 
-to be brought about. His prescription is diminu-. | 
tion of holidays, and diminution of composition. 
_But pupils cannot always be learning: they need 
holidays. And composition certainly helps rather 
than hinders the knowledge of languages. Milton, 
says one of his biographers, makes “the well-known 
mistake of regarding education as merely the com- 
munication of useful knowledge. . . . It re- . 
quires much observation of young minds to discover

that the rapid inculcation of unassimilated infor- 
mation stupefies the faculties instead of training 
| them.”? : 
3: “The proper study of mankind is man,” not 
Nature. This line of Pope, though not quoted, is 
the gist of Dr. Johnson’s objection to Milton’s 
views. It may be answered: Milton does include 
in -his course Ethics and History, Poetry and Dra- 
matic Literature, which many generations have 
thought stimulating and wholesome food for young 
minds; but he does not give them pre-eminence, 
and attaches much greater importance to knowledge 
of Nature. The epigram about a famous Cambridge 
don may almost be applied to the Tractate : “Science 
is its forte, omniscience its foible.” Milton’s plan 
coincides to a great extent with that of many 
modern reformers, who would make education more 
scientific and less literary: only the element of 
“man” must not be omitted. 
4, Milton would teach Agriculture through Latin, 
and Science through Greek! It is answered that 
no other course was open to him, not having the 
abundance of modern hand-books from which in 
the present day Science can be taught. But even 
two hundred and fifty years ago a great advance 
had been made on the methods of Cato and Colum- 
ella, as was to be expected after fifteen centuries, 
and Milton’s contemporaries were not satisfied with 
the physiology of Aristotle, nor with the medicine 
of Celsus. :

Holidays are to vanish, except in the matter of the 
excursions as a part of discipline. In the same 
way the play hours are all to be made of use for 
purposes of drill. Fencing and wr ~

which have flowered off, and are ax.

apparent in many places. Notice, for insti

ledge of personal duty, they may then begin the 
study of Economics.” The modern reader naturally 
misunderstands this last word, giving it a modern 
meaning. Milton means that the student may pass 
from the study of his individual duty to that of the 
art of living in a family. Much of personal or in- 
dividual duty, of course, implies a knowledge of this, 
and it would have been highly instructive if Milton 
had been more explicit, or could have told of some 
manual of Economics (in his sense). He does not, 
however, leave us without a clue to his meaning, 
because he selects two tragedies that treat of house- 
hold (or economic) matters. The lesson of the 
“Alcestis” is unselfishness on the side of the wife, 
but Admetus, the husband, according to modern 
ideas, does not play a very noble part in accepting 
his wife’s sacrifice. It then occurs to Milton that 
choice comedies may teach useful lessons in family 
life, and he wisely inserts comedies before tragedies. 
As he adds the words “Greek or Latin,” the value 
-of Italian comedies occurs to him. They must not 
be omitted, so, working backwards, he puts in the 
little sentence about learning Italian “ easily at any 
odd hour,” which has so often been quoted with 
scorn. : : 
The following sarcastic remarks upon the im- 
practicable character of Milton’s education proceed 
from the pen of an anonymous literary man:1 
“Here will every stripling, by the time he is one

the Prose Works of John Milton, by J. G. Graham” (p. 145).

and twenty, have read- more Latin and Greek 
authors than, perhaps, the most veteran scholar 
in these degenerate days; he will besides have 
mastered the Italian, the Hebrew, the Chaldee, and 
Syrian at ‘odd hours’? He will have made him- 
~-self, in his schoolroom and playground, a complete 
farmer, architect, engineer, sportsman, apothecary, 
anatomist, law-giver, philosopher, general officer of 
cavalry, skilled in ‘embattling, marching, encamp- 
ing, fortifying, besieging and battering,’ equal to the 
command of an army, the moment he has escaped 
from the rod.” ~ 
On the other hand, the case for Milton is 
summed up by the Proféssor of the Institutes 
and History of Education in the University of 
Edinburgh, who puts, Milton’s ideas into modern 
language : 
-“ Drop the mere externelities of the scheme and 
eonterhplate the ideas, and what do we find ? 
(1) A condemnation of exclusive Latin, and 
- Greek instruction, with which all thinking 
men now agree. 
(2) A condemnation of the verbalism and form- 
alism of the teaching, which also now meets 
with universal acceptance. 
(8) An advocacy of nature-instruction and of 
practical hand-work: who is there among 
thinking educationalists now to question | 
this ? ‘ / | 
2Not quite fair. Milton said Italian at any odd hour, | 
Hebrew “at a set hour” (p. 17, L. 15).
-P-A-G-E-32
INTRODUCTION. xxxi 
(4) An earnest plea for direct word instruction: 
still awaiting response from our schools. 
(5) A denunciation of attempts at composition 
without material to write about. 
(6) Generally, the putting the study of the seat 
of sense and the seat of the Humanities 
before the study of the organic arts— 
Grammar, Logic, Rhetoric: “ Matter before 
Form.” All intelligent. teachers (at least, 
theoretically) now accept this. 
(7) The recommendation of technical instruction 
in its widest sense. 
. (8) The advocacy of gymnastic and military 
drill, now accepted elements in all properly 
organized education. 
(9) The teaching of Latin grammar by means of 
the English tongue, and not in Latin, as was, 
then, and until quite recently, universal. , 
Even his encyclopedism may be defended as a 
necessary protest against the meagre intellectual 
life of the schools of his time.” + 
_If there were nothing worth remembering in the 
Tractate except the glorious definition’ of a com- 
plete and generous education, great would be its 
value. Not the particular recommendations of the 
scheme, but “the noble moral glow that pervades 
it, the mood of magnanimity in which it is con- 
ceived and written, and the faith it inculcates in 
the powers of the young human spirit, if rightly

fessor Masson, “are merits everlasting.” 
IV. BIBLIOGRAPHY. , 
The Tractate was published in June, 1644, in’ 
quarto, eight pages, in rather small type. It was 
anonymous, and had no title page, but was simply 
headed—‘* Of Education: to Master Samuel Hart- 
lib.” All who cared knew that the eight pages 
were Milton’s; but it is doubtful whether many 
cared, and probably the circulation was small. 
Twenty-nine years later, in 1673, when Milton pub- 
lished a second edition of his Minor Poems, he re- 
printed, in better form of type, this small pamphlet 
at the end of the book. On the title page 
volume occurs for the first time the name 
tate,” under which the little book generall; 
“ Poems, ete., upon several occasions. By Ms. vous 
Milton. Both English, and Latin, ete. Composed | 
at several times. With a small Tractate of Educa- 
tion to Mr. Hartlib.” It is only on the title page. 
that the name Tractate occurs. When the text 
begins it is headed as before—* Of Education: To 
Master Samuel Hartlib,” with these words added, 
“Written above twenty years since.” The addition | 
shows a singular carelessness on Milton’s part as to. 
bibliography. Curiously enough, in complete sets of 
Milton’s works, this heading, which understates by | 
nine years the interval between the two editions, is 
usually reprinted without explanation.

than once the book has been printed

lL, “with a dedication to Lord Harcourt, at

8, was just dead. His eldest son, afterwards 
IIL, was then thirteen; and Edward Augus- 
arwards Duke of York, was just twelve. 
v little over twenty-eight the latter died at 
The dedication adds that it was thought 
y “at this juncture to reprint it, as the 
ty of ourselves and posterity depends, in a 
veasure, on the education of two princes,

a model for the youth of this nation.” It

effect on the training of his future Majesty. The

quite without comment, as part of the prospectus of 
a projected “ Academical Institution” in Edinburgh.!

The only separate edition accompanied by notes| 
and an introduction for the use of studenti 
bridge University Press, 1890), that of Mi 
Browning of Cambridge, and formerly a masver ay 
' Eton, is described as “an exact facsimile of the’ 
edition of 1673, published in Milton’s lifetime.” 
With a curious idolatry it even reproduces the mis- 
prints of that edition. It has all the old-fa ~ 
spelling, the italics and the capitals. It i 
true that Milton was living when the edi 
1673 was published, and if Milton had enjo 
use of his eyesight, and had been particula 
his spelling and the general look of his page 
would be something to be said for reproducing we 
book as he sent it to the press. But his sight 
began to fail in 1644, the year when the little 
book first appeared, carelessly printed; and it 
awkward shape and form: six years later 
great work of the “ Defensio pro populo Anglicauo 
made Milton completely blind. 
There is no reason to believe that Milton ever 
attached importance to English spelling or to stops. 
Though Chaucer expressed the hope that none would 
“miswrite ” his little book, the importance of spel- 
ling -may on the whole be considered rather a 
modern fancy. Milton probably left such matters 
wholly to the printer. “To ‘medernize,’” says Mark 
Pattison in his preface to the “Essay on Man,” 
“the spelling of a classic is nothing less than to 
deface one of the monuments of the language.”

but in a book intended for educational purposes it 
seems better to follow the general practice. “ Spel- 
ling in Hooker’s time, and for long afterwards, was 
not only anomalous, as ours also is, but anomalous 
with an apparent unconsciousness of the possibility 
of regularity.”1 Of the many editions of Shak- 
spere’s plays with teaching in view, none follow the 
vagaries of the First Folio, which would certainly 
have been printed with much greater jcare. had 
Shakspere himself superintended it, as he did the 
printing of the Sonnets. There are facsinfilé 
editions of Bacon, but hardly in unum scholarum ; - 
and the spelling of Milton’s poems 'is modernized in‘ ° 
the many excellent students’ editions -of them. 
Many of the spellings of the old edition——they 
cannot be called Milton’s spellings—are not only 
wrong, but without excuse—ey., forreign, perswasion, 
comming, extream, theam, souldery, mispendiny, adve. 
Humane for “human,” then for “than,” though 
common in original editions of Bacon and Shak- 
spere, are misleading; /ain’d for “feigned” is 
probably a misprint. If an old use, it is unfor- 
tunate. As is pointed out in the note, p. 16,111, 
Milton would probably have written Cconomics. 
Where there is a reason for them several of the old 
spellings have been retained: fadomless, rimers, 
docible, spatious, unexpedient, pronuntiation, and 
kicshoes. The greatest doubt has been felt about

For a modern reader the division into paragraphs, 
probably Milton’s own, is inadequate. There are 
only eight in the whole Tractate, and in this edition 
a paragraph would be on an average three-and-a>half 
pages. At one place (p. 20, 1. 12) there is a greats 
break, with the sub-heading “Their Exercise.” There 
is no sufficient reason why one sub-division of the 
book should have a heading and none of the others, 
{ which are certainly of equal importance. In this 
edition paragraphs have been made of modern length, 
and there are about three times as many. 
Vv. MILTON’S PROSE STYLE. 
It is the duty of criticism not to be dismayed by 
J even the greatest names. The attitude of mind 
that merely finds what is to be admired in the writ- 
ings of great authors, like Shakspere, Goethe, and 
Milton, may be reverential, but certainly is not 
critical. It is not impertinent to dissect Milton’s 
prose style: to disapprove of it is consistent with 
} strong admiration for Milton. Others have found . 
fault with it before. Hallam, for instance, says — 
that “an absence of idiomatic grace and an use of 
| harsh inversions, violating the rules of language 
distinguish in general the writings of Milton, and 
require in order to compensate them such high 
beauties as will sometimes occur.” Keble points 
out the contrast between the extremes of Milton’s 
prose, though he is probably referring rather to the

matter than to the manner: “It must b 
expressive warning to men of genius to

as if an angel had held the pen, and the n 
-geems to me, more like Cobbett’s style 1

own critic, when he says: “If I were wisi 
my own ends I should not choose this 
writing, wherein knowing myself inferior t 
led by the genial power of nature to anoth 
have the use as I may account but of 
hand.”! And yet Milton’s greatness as 
writer is hardly sufficiently recognized. 
ject-matter of much of his prose is hopel 
of date and lacking in interest to moderr 
and the style in which he writes is so 
different from that of later prose writers 1

his’ own view, and to regard his poetry : 
the inborn power of nature and his pro

that Milton writing verse has over Milton writing 
prose, and laying the blame of the latter on the 
inadequacy of the he vehicle, bgcause a good prose 
Btyle hadfot in Milton’s time been invented, yet 
says: “No contemporary English prose writer must

best known eulogy on Milton’s prose proceeds from 
Macaulay: “As compositions, they deserve the atten- 
tion of every man who wishes to become acquainted 
-with the full power of the English language. They 
abound with passages compared with which the 
finest declamations of Burke sink into insignificance. 
They are a perfect field of cloth of gold. The style 
is stiff with gorgeous embroidery. Not even in the 
earlier books of the “Paradise Lost” has the great 
poet ever risen higher than in those parts of his 
controversial works in which his feelings, excited 
by conflict, find a vent in bursts of devotional and 
lyric rapture. It is, to borrow his own majestic 
language, ‘a sevenfold chorus of hallelujahs and 
harping symphonies’”! It has been pointed out? 
that the comparison with Burke is a little un- 
fortunate, for Burke’s prose has usually been 
thought “too declamatory, too easily carried away 
by his imagination,” and now we are told that 
Milton is more declamatory than Burke. One 
cannot help wondering what Milton himself would 
have thought of Macaulay’s praise. Lastly, it must 
be remembered that even this praise is a praise of 
parts and not of Milton’s prose as a whole, and 
is- quite consonant with the distinguishing comment 
of Hallam and of Keble. Milton’s prose is. rich 
and powerful, rich in magnificent passages—what 
Horace calls “purple patches”—-and powerful in 
much of the matter and the argument, but certainly

that there may be a good Latinized style—mai 
a critic would select Gibbon’s as representative 
such a style—but that Browne’s is too much i 
fluenced by Latin.. Yet the Latin element

cognize that a Latin idiom in English is equally 
to be avoided. In Milton’s time, it should be 
remembered, and indeed from the Renaissance 
almost to our own day, Cicero’s Latin was almost 
the only Latin acknowledged. Cicero loves a long, 
built-up sentence. Milton, through his great know- 
ledge of Latin and familiarity with it, imitates this 
structure of sentence: but Latin is an inflected 
language. In an inflected language, inversions for 
the sake of emphasis are possible which breed 
obscurity in an uninflected language, such as English, 
which has lost almost all its inflections. There is  
-P-A-G-E-42
INTRODUCTION. xii 
a great deal to be said for the use of @ periodic 
sentence in English. -It is stately, dignified, and 
can be very harmonious. Here is an admirable 
definition of it: “Each of these stately periods 
carries along with it, over and above its direct 
predication, all the conditions and exceptions to 
which the writer wishes to submit that predication, 
all woven into one structure. There is in each 
sentence so much as fills the mind to the utmost 
strain of its capacity for attention; and then a 
pause for reflection and digestion.”! Or take an 
earlier way of describing the same thing. Fuller, 
in describing Hooker’s preaching, says, “His stile 
was long and pithy, drawing on a whole flock of 
clauses before he came to the close of a sentence.”? 
These are the rules of the period, and those who 
use the period should abide by them, however 
difficult they are. Milton assuredly does not. He 
seems to believe in length of sentence for its own 
sake. Here isa passage from one of his prose works : 
“TI had no fear but that the authors of Smec- 
tymnuus, to all the show of solidity which the 
Remonstrant could bring, were prepared both with -

antiquity which he and his, out of stratagem, are 
wont to raise; but, when I saw his weak arguments

long sentence. What the French call le style coupé 
is to Milton a coy, flirting style, and short sentences _ 
are curtal gibes. Here, from the same book, is 
another attack on short sentences : 
“[He] sets me out half-a-dozen tizzical! mottoes, 
wherever he had them, hopping short in the 
measure of convulsion fits; in which labour the 
agony of his wit having escaped narrowly, instead 
of well-sized periods, he greets us with a quantity 
of thumb-ring posies.” 
It was the fashion of the day for grave persons, 
such as aldermen, to wear a broad gold ring upon 
the thumb, and on these rings, as on knives and 
swords, short mottoes were often engraven. A 
good instance is given by Shakspere in the “Mer- 
chant of Venice,” v. i. 148: 
“a paltry ring 
That she did give to me, whose posy was 
For all the world like cutler’s poetry 
Upon a knife, “ Love me and leave me not.” 
So Milton objects to short sentences, and prefers 
them long. The modern world seems to prefer 
them short; but the wise critic says that length of 
sentence should not be the criterion. Whether 
1“ Tizzical” is Milton’s own spelling. Nowadays we spell 
it more correctly, “ phthisical,” though doctors pronounce the 
word as if the first vowel were long. Masson interprets 
“tizzical” by “asthmatic ;” but it means “consumptive.” 
The idea is that the sentence itself is wasted away by disease. 
An asthmatic sentence would rather mean one such as would 
be gasped out by a man suffering from asthma.
-P-A-G-E-45
xliv MILTON’S OF EDUCATION. 
long or short, let them be clear; and do not make 
all of one pattern. What Cowper said in another 
‘connexion is true: “Harmony, the path to fame.” 
In the structure of the sentence the truest harmony 
is to be found in neither extreme, but in sentences 
of moderate length carefully constructed. 
‘When Keble compared some of Milton’s sentences 
to Cobbett’s style he was referring to their coarse- 
ness rather than to their force. Many critics hold 
that Cobbett’s is a model style for forcible writing. 
Cobbett, like Milton, wrote a Grammar, but whilst 
Milton’s was a Latin Accidence, Cobbett’s was an 
English Grammar, Milton does not include English 
Grammar among the studies of his Academy, and he 
is often inaccurate and even ungrammatical. Some 
of these inaccuracies are pointed out in notes: 
A sentence that is no sentence (p. 9, 1. 22). 
Wrong use of present participle (p. 4, 1. 22; 
p. 10,1. 6). : 
No subject to view (p. 13, 1. 18). 
Omitted antecedent (p. 1,1 8; p. 6, 1. 21). 
Inversions, first two sentences (p. 3, ll. 4 and 5). 
Either and or (p. 2,1. 20; p. 7,1. 21; p. 8,119). 
It is sometimes urged that Milton wrote in a 
hurry, and that may be true of the Tractate, but 
very similar mistakes can be found in. books that 
were published without any need for hurry at all. 
Let us, however, leave Milton’s style in the words

ary literary prose, and the most wonderful poet's 
prose, embodied in English literature.” A. W. 
Ward) 
“ As Milton’s poetry is unique in one section of 
our literature, so is his prose in the other. It is 
prose of that old English, or as some might say, old 
‘Gothic .kind which was in use among us ere yet 
men had given their days and nights to Addison, 
and when it seemed as lawful that thought in prose 
should come in the form of a brimming flood, or 
even of a broken cataract, as in that of a trim and 
limpid rivulet. But even amid the greatest speci- 
mens of such prose of the pre-Addisonian period 
Milton’s prose is peculiar. That of Bacon may roll 
with it a richer detritus of speculative hints and 
propositions; that of Jeremy Taylor may have a 
mellower beauty; but no prose in the language is 
grander than Milton’s or more indicative of moral 
greatness. Its characteristic in its best passages is 
a kind of sustained and sometimes cumbrous and 
operose magniloquence. Milton tells us himself 
that he wrote slowly, and one can see that as he 
wrote he was abashed by no weight of thought or 
sublimity of fancies that could come to him, but 
would pile thoughts and fancies together till no 
prose sentence could convey the whole burden in 
its cadence, and the residue had to be conveyed in 
a poetic chaunt.” Masson?

most industrious after wisdom ; so that lan- 
guage is but the instrument conveying to us 
things useful to be known. And though a 
linguist should pride himself to have all thes 
tongues that Babel cleft the world into, yet, 
if he have not studied the solid things in 
them as well as the words and lexicons, he 
were nothing so much to be esteemed a 
learned man, as any yeoman or tradesman 10° 
competently wise in his mother dialect only. 
Hence appear the many mistakes which 
have made learning generally so unpleasing 
and. so unsuccessful. First we do amiss to 
spend seven or eight years merely in scraping 15 
together so much miserable Latin and Greek, . 
as might be learnt otherwise easily and de- 
lightfully i in one year. And that which casts 
our proficiency therein so much behind is our 
time lost partly in too oft idie vacancies given 20 
~ both to Schools and Universities, partly in a 
preposterous exaction, forcing the empty wits 
of children to compose themes, verses and 
orations, which are the acts of ripest judg- 
ment and the final work of a head filled by 25

/ long reading and observing, with elegant 
maxims, and copious invention. These are 
not matters to be wrung from poor striplings, 
like blood out of the nose, or the plucking of | 
5 untimely fruit: besides the ill habit which — 
they get of wretched barbarizing against the 
Latin and Greek zdiom, with their untutored. 
Anglicisms, odious to be read, yet not to be 
avoided without a well continued and judicious 
loconversing among pure authors digested, 
which they scarce taste. Whereas, if after some 
preparatory grounds of speech by their certain | 
forms got into memory, they were led to the 
praxis thereof in some chosen short book

would bring, the whole language quickly into

25 Universities not yet well recovered from the

Scholastic grossness of barbarous ages, that 
in stead of beginning with Arts most easy, 
and those be such as are most obvious to the

novices at first coming with the most intel-5 
lective abstractions of Logic and .Meta-

left those Grammatic flats and shallows 
‘where they stuck unreasonably to learn a 
few words with lamentable construction, and 10 
now on the sudden transported under another 
climate to be tossed and turmoiled with their

promising and pleasing thoughts of litigious 
terms, fat contentions, and flowing fees ; 
others betake them to state affairs, with souls 
580 unprincipled in virtue and true generous 
‘breeding, that flattery, and Court shifts and 
tyrannous aphorisms appear to them the 
highest points of wisdom, instilling their 
barren hearts with a conscientious slavery, if,

enjoyments of ease and luxury, living out 
‘their days in feast and jollity ; which indeed

taken. And these are the fruits of misspend- 
ing our prime youth at the Schools and

‘this pattern, ag many edifices may be con-

better: and while this is doing, their speech 
is to be fashioned to a distinct and clear pro- 
nuntiation, as near as may be to the Italian, 
especially in the vowels. For we Englishmen 
being far northerly, do not open our mouths 5 
in the cold air wide enough to grace a 
southern tongue; but are observed by all 
other nations to speak exceeding close and 
inward: so that to smatter Latin with an 
English mouth, is as ill a hearing as Law- 10 
French. Next to make them expert in the | 
season them, and win them early to the love 
of virtue and true labour, ere any flattering 
seducement, or vain principle seize them wan-.15

Education would be read to them; whereof 
the Greeks have store, as Cebes, Plutarch, 
and other Socratic discourses. But in Latin 
we have none of classic authority extant, 20 
except the two or three first Books of Quin- 
tulian, and some select pieces elsewhere. 
But here the main skill and groundwork 
will be, to temper them such lectures and ex- 
planations upon every opportunity, as may lead 25

and draw them in willing obedience, inflamed 
with the study of learning, and the admira- 
tion of virtue, stirred up with high hopes of 
living to be brave men, and worthy patriots, 
sdear to God, and famous to all ages. That 
they may despise and scorn all their childish,. 
and ill-taught qualities, to delight in manly, 
and liberal exercises: which he who hath the 
art, and proper eloquence to catch them 
‘lo with, what with mild and effectual persua- 
sions, and what with the intimation of some 
fear, if need be, but chiefly by his own 
’ example, might in a short space gain them 
to an incredible diligence and courage: infus- 
15 ing into their young breasts such an ingenu- 
ous and noble ardor, as would not fail to make 
many of them renowned and. matchless men. 
"At the same time, some other hour of the day, 
“might be taught them the rules of Arithmetic, 
goand soon after the elements of Geometry, 
even playing, as the old manner was. After 
evening repast, till bed-time their thoughts 
will be best taken up in the easy grounds

the matter is most easy, and if the language

“an occasion of inciting and enabling them here- 5 
after to improve the tillage of their country, 
to recover the bad soil, and to remedy the 
waste that is made of good: for this was one 
of Hercules’ praises. Ere half these authors 
be read (which will soon be with plying hard, 10 
and daily) they cannot choose but be masters 
of any ordinary prose. So that it will be 
then seasonable for them to learn in any 
modern author, the use of the globes, and all 
the maps; first with the old names, and then 15 
with the new: or they might be then capable _ 
to read any compendious method of Natural 
Philosophy. And at the same time might-be 
entering into the Greek tongue, after the same 
manner as was before prescribed in the Latin ; 20

Seneca’s natural questions, ‘to Mela, Celsus,

_ principles of Arithmetic, Geometry, Astro- 
nomy, and Geography with a general compact 
sof Physics, they may descend in Mathematics 
to the instrumental science of Trigonometry, 
and from thence to. Fortification, Architec- 
ture, Enginry, or Navigation. And in Natural 
Philosophy they may proceed leisurely 
iothe History of meteors, minerals, plants auu 
living creatures as far as Anatomy. Then 
also in course might. be read to them out of 
some not tedious writer the institution of 
physic ; that they may know the tempers, 
15 the humours, the seasons, and how to manage 
a crudity: which he who can wisely and 
timely do, is not only a great physician to 
himself, and to his friends, but also may at 
some time or other, save an army by this 
20 frugal and. expenseless means only ; and not 
let the healthy and stout bodies of young men

tics, what hinders’ but that they may ‘pro- 
cure, as oft as shall be needful, the helpful 
‘experiences of hunters, fowlers, fishermen, 
shepherds, gardeners, apothecaries; and in 
the other sciences, architects, engineers, 5 
mariners, anatomists; who doubtless would 
be ready some for reward, and some to favour 
such a hopeful seminary. And this will give 
them such a real tincture of natural know- 
ledge, as they shall never forget, but daily 10 
augment with delight. Then also those poets 
which are now counted most hard, will be both 
facile and pleasant, Orpheus, Hesiod, Theocri- 
tus, Aratus, Nicander, Oppian, Dionysius, 
and in Latin Lucretius,.Manilius, and the 15 
rural parts of Virgil. 
By this time, years and good general pre- 
cepts will have furnished them more distinctly 
with that act of reason which in, Ethics is 
called Proairesis: that they may with some 20 
judgement contemplate upon moral good and 
evil, Then will be required a special rein-

ing to set them right and firm, instructing 
them more amply in the knowledge of virtue 25

and the hatred:of vice: while their young 
- and pliant affections are led through all the 
moral works of Plato, Xenophon, Cicero, Plu- 
tarch, Laertius, and those Locrian remnants ; 
sbut still to be reduced, in their nightward 
studies wherewith they close the day’s work, 
under the determinate sentence of David or 
Salomon, or the Evangels and Apostolic 
Scriptures. Being perfect in the knowledge 
l0of personal duty, they may then begin the 
study of Economics. And either now, or 
before this, they may have easily learnt at 
any odd hour the Italian tongue. And soon 
after, but with wariness and good antidote, it 
15 would be wholesome enough to let them taste 
some choice Comedies, Greek, Latin, or Italian: 
those Tragedies also that treat of household 
matters, as Trachime, Alcestis, and the like.

of them got by memory, and solemnly pro- 
nounced with right accent and grace, as 
might be taught, would endue them even 
with the spirit and vigor of Demosthenes or

with them those organic arts which enable men 
to discourse and write perspicuously, elegantly, 
and according to the fitted style, of lofty, 
10 mean, or lowly. Logic therefore so much as 
is useful, is to be referred to this due place 
with all her well couched heads and topics, 
until it. be time to open her contracted palm 
into a graceful and ornate Rhetorie taught 
15 out of the rule of Plato, Aristotle, Phalereus, 
Cicero, Hermogenes, Longinus. To which 
Poetry would be made subsequent, or indeed 
rather precedent, as being less subtle and 
fine, but more simple, sensuous and passion- 
goate. I mean not here the prosody of a verse, 
which they could not but have hit on before 
among the rudiments of Grammar; but that 
sublime art which in Aristotle’s Poetics, in 
Horace, and the Italian commentaries of 
25 Castelvetro, Tasso, Mazzoni, and others,
-P-A-G-E-66

teaches what the laws are of a true Epic 
Poem, what of a Dramatic, what of a Lyric, 
what decorum is, which is the grand maater- 
piece to observe. This would make them 
soon perceive what despicable creatures our 5. 
common rimers and play-writers be, and shew 
them, what religious, what glorious and mag- 
nificent use might be made of Poetry both 
in divine and human things, 
From hence and not till now will be the 10 
~ight season of forming them to be able writers 
md composers in every excellent matter, when 
hhey shall be thus fraught with an universal 
nsight into things. Or whether they be to 
speak in Parliament or Council, honour and 15 
vttention would be waiting on their lips. 
(here would then also appear in pulpits 
sather visages, other gestures, and stuff other- 
wise wrought than what we now sit under, 
oft times to as great a trial of our patience 20

twenty ; unless they rely more upon their 26 E

ancestors dead, than upon themselves living. 
In which methodical course it is so supposed 
they must proceed by the steady pace of 
learning onward, as at convenient times for 
5memory’s sake to retire back into the middle 
ward, and sometimes into the rear of what 
they have been taught, until they have con- 
firmed, and solidly united the whole body of 
their perfected knowledge, like the last embatt- 
10 ling of a Roman Legion. Now will be worth 
the seeing what exercises and recreations 
may best agree, and become these studies. 
The course of Study hitherto briefly de-— 
scribed, is, what I can guess by reading, 
15 likest to those ancient and famous Schools of 
~ Pythagoras, Plato, Isocrates, Aristotle and such others, out of which were bred up such 
a number of-renowned philosophers, orators, 
historians, poets and princes all over Greece, 
20 Italy, and Asia, besides the flourishing Studies 
of Cyrene and Alexandria. But herein it 
shall exceed them, and supply a defect as 
great as that which Plato noted in the 
common-wealth of Sparta; whereas that city 
26 trained up their youth most for war, and ee eee een tet

these in their Academies and

which I here delineate, shall be equall

an hour and a half ere they eat at noons 
should be allowed them for exercise and due 
rest afterwards: but the time for this may - 
be enlarged at pleasure, according as their 
rising in the morning shall be early. 
The exercise which I commend first is the 10 
exact use of their weapon, to guard and to 
strike safely with edge, or point; this will 
keep them healthy, nimble, strong, and well 
in bieath, is also the likeliest means to make 
them grow large and tall, and to inspire 15 
_ them with a gallant and fearless courage, 
which being tempered with seasonable -lec- 
tures and precepts to them of true fortitude 
and patience, will turn into a native and 
heroic valour, and_make them _hate the 20

Pagel. Tractate. This name has now a somewhat old-fashioned ring. 
The word ‘tract,’ now generally applied to a very small book on 
@ religious topic, is a shorter form of it. The Latin word 
tractatus, literally a handling (tractare, to handle, frequentative 
of trahere), is used frequently by Quintilian in the sense of 
dealing with a subject, and by Pliny for a little book. ‘Tractate’ 
comes to English direct from the Latin, and is probably of the 
Renaissance time, but the word had come into English through 
French. There is an-old French treatise which is used by 
Chaucer, who wrote a prose Treatise on the Astrolabe, and near 
the beginning of it speaks of «thy bisy preyere in special to 
lerne the Tretis of the Astrolabie” (Skeat’s edition, vol. iii., 
p. 175). : 
_ Master and afterwards Mr. The latter is an abbreviation 
of the former, as Mrs. was of Mistress. Mister and Missis 
as pronunciations are modern. Skeat says, ‘‘Richardson’s sup- 
position that it is connected with Middle English mister, a trade, 
ig as absurd as it is needless; notwithstanding the oft-quoted 
‘what mister wight’ (Spenser, F. Q. i. 9. 23). Of course, that 
means “a wight of what kind” (mister =French métier, Latin 
méinisterium), or, a8 we say, ‘‘ what kind of a man.” 
Samuel Hartlib, Milton’s friend, was partly a foreigner, a few 
(perhaps eight) years older than Milton. His father was a refugee 
from Poland, but his mother was English. He himself was in 
business in the city, but having plenty of leisure he devoted it 
to various public questions, especially to the reform of educa- 
tion. In this matter he was a zealous follower of John Amos 
Comenius, whom he admired more than Milton did. He pub- 
lished in England two of Comenius’ educational books—one, at 
least, without obtaining the author’s permission. Taking an 
interest in thé improvement in education, Hartlib issued, at his 
own cost, several treatises oR, that subject. About twelve  
-P-A-G-E-76
NOTES. ; - 29 
months after the meeting of the Long Parliament Hartlib dedi- Page 1. 
cated to it a little tract, A description of the famous kingdom of 
Macaria, a short account of an ideal state. Macaria is Greek for 
‘happy land,’ Itis quite evident that Hartlib spent his substance 
freely, in publishing tracts by himself and others, in agricultural 
ond in educational experiments ; and as it was ized that 
he had done this with a single eye to the public good, Cromwell 
granted him a pension of £300 a year, which, of course, was lost 
at the Restoration, when, by the bye, it was more than two. 
years in arrears. The philanthropic Hartlib says that he was 
“familiarly acquainted with the Best of Archbishops, Bishops, 
Earls, Viscounts, Barons, Knights, Esquires, Gentlemen, Minis- 
ters, Professors of both Universities, Merchants, and all sorts of 
learned or in any kind useful men.” Under which of these 
heads shall we class Milton, who addressed to Hartlib his 
Tractate of Education, the result of a request made by Hartlib 
himself? “Sir William Petty also wrote Two Letters to Hartlib 
on the same topic, the drift of these published letters being to 
give to education a more practical character. Hartlib was a 
man of boundless enthusiasm for reforms. ‘ There is scarce one 
day,” he wrote to a friend, ‘‘and one hour of the day or night, 
being brim full with all manner of objects of the most public and 
universal nature, but my soul is crying out, . 
‘ Phosphore, redde diem? Quid gaudia nostra moraris? 
Phosphore, redde diem.’”

-P-A-G-E-78
NOTES. 31 
‘ types. In some sense like this, though not so technical, Milton Page 3 
used it, and because this sense is lost, we now have the noun 
‘ideal,’ warped from its adjectival use. ‘‘We may die but 
the idea lives for ever. Liberty, equality, and fraternity must 
come” (Kingsley, Alton Locke, ch. xxxvii., p. 403), hat is 
now ‘idea’ for us? How infinite the fall of this word, since the 
time when Milton sang of the Creator contemplating His newly- 
created world— 
“how it showed 
Tn prospect from his throne, how good, how fair, 
Answering his great idea.”—P. L. vii. 557— 
to its present use, when this person ‘has an idea that the train 
has started,’ and the other, ‘had no idea that the dinner would 
be so bad.’ Matters have not mended since the time of Dr. 
Johnson, who, as Boswell tells us, ‘‘was particularly indignant 
against the almost universal use of the word idea in the sense 
notion or opinion, when it is clear that idea can onl: . 
signify something of which an image can be formed in the mind.” 
There is perhaps no word in the whole compass of the language 
so ill treated (Trench, Hnglish Past and Present, p. 313). 
Voluntary idea=voluntary pattern; no compulsion to be 
employed to make any conform to the pattern. 
24. Janua’s and Didactics. Milton is here sneering at Com- 
enius. Janua Linguarum Reserata was the name of one of this 
author’s books, the gate of languages opened, a method of teach- 
ing languages, “‘along with the elements of all the Sciences and 
Arts, comprehended under a hundred chapter-headings and in a 
thousand sentences.” His aim, says ofessor Laurie, was 
“to teach words through things and things through words.” 
This book was translated into no fewer than fourteen different 
languages. The other book alluded to was called Didactica 
Magna, Omnes omnia docendi artificia exhibens. Didactica is 
singular, agreeing with Ars understood. ‘It was put forth as 
4 systematic treatment of the whole question of Education.” 
Milton is certainly too supercilious in his mention of Comenius, 
who was rendering excellent service to thé cause of education. 
The best account of John Amos Comenius is that by Professor 
Laurie in the Education Library. The name is Latinized from Komenski. He was a Moravian and ultimately a Bishop of the Moravian Church, ‘‘Bishop of the Scattered Brethren.” His dates are 1592-1671. It is chiefly as an educational reformer 
Comenius is remembered. In that capacity he came to London, 
and if the Civil War had not broken out he would probably have received revenues from Parliament to open a college, 
From England he went to Sweden, and later for a while he Kept 
aschool at Elbing in the province of Prussia. He wrote many books, over forty on Education.

3. flowered off. The illustration is from the garden. ‘These

9. The end of Learning. Here, says Mark Pattison, ‘we have 
the theological Milton,” as in the definition of Education on 
p. 9 we have Milton the citizen, ‘the true Milton.” 
The end then. On this paragraph Professor Laurie 
(Addresses on Educational Subjects, p. 167), remarks: ‘‘In this 
ge we have several propositions which it is worth our while 
to disentangle that we may clearly comprehend Milton’s view 
of the End of Education. 1. The aim of Education is the 
knowledge of God and likeness to God. 2. Likeness to God we 
attain by Rossessing our souls of true Virtue and by the Heavenly 
Grace ‘aith. 3, Knowledge of God we attain by the study of 
the visible things of God. 4. Teaching, then, has for its aim 
this knowledge. 5. Language is merely an instrument or vehicle 
for the knowledge of things. 6. The knowledge of all the 
languages in the world, without a knowledge of the solid things 
regarding which they treat, leaves a man less ‘learned’ than any 
farmer or tradesman who knows only his own vernacular, but, in 
and through that, has a competent knowledge of things.”

themselves apparent to the senses.

by Bacon, is to know how. ‘To ken’ is to know. The Scotch 
say ‘I dinna ken.’

grave servant, I allow well: so that he be such a one that hath

quotes this passage, and Skeat quotes Blount’s Glossography, 
published in the very year of Milton’s death. “‘ Aegxés, of or for 
words, 7d Aetixdy sc. BiSdov, a lexicon or dictionary. Phot. and

idle vacancies, sc. holidays. Vacance is French for the 
English ‘vacation.’ Milton may mean that the regular school 
holidays and University vacations are too long, or he may refer 
to the whole holidays in the middle of school time, or the no- 
lecture days during the University term. Red-letter Saints’

verses. John Locke, writing half a century later, says, 
“Tf these may be any reasons against children making Latin 
themes at school, I have much more to say, and of more weight, 
against their making verses of any sort: for, if he has no genius 
to poetry, it is the most unreasonable thing in the world to 
torment a child, and to waste his time about that which can 
never succeed” (Thoughts on Education). Compulsory verse- 
making survived Milton’s attack by more than two centuries, 
and even now is dying with difficulty.

6. barbarizing, speaking or writing like a barbarian, violatin 
the laws of Latin or Greek grammer. The Greeks called all 
foreigners PépBapo, which prol bly first meant ‘stammering or 
talking gibberish.’ The Romans took the word from the Greeks, 
but felt that they could not apply it to the Greeks themselves: 
so that in Latin dardarus means ‘not Latin nor Greek,’ Ovid, 
in exile, wrote, “‘Barbarus hic ego nunc, quia non intelligor 
ull.”

Page6. 6. against, contrary to. 
7. idiom, a mode of expression peculiar to a language—from 
Greek, téos, one’s own. Skeat quotes Minshen’s Guide into the 
Tongues (1627) with spelling ‘“ idiome.” 
8. Anglicism, introducing an English idiom into Latin or 
’ Greek. Murray quotés Bentley’s Phalaris § 11, p. 318, ‘‘Dr. 
B. has abundance of pure Anglicisms in his Latin.” The earliest 
se in the New English Dictionary is only two years before this 
ractate. 
10. digested. The word ‘taste’ following shows that the 
illustration is from the use of food. Latin digero, carry in 
different directions, hence, arrange. Ovid, Flora, ‘‘Hos ego 
digestos potui numerare colores.” ‘These colours I was able to 
divide and count.’ Jn the Collect for Second Sunday in Advent: 
—‘* Blessed Lord, who hast caused all Holy Scriptures to be 
-written for our learning, grant that we may in such wise hear 
them, read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest them.” That is, 
that we may teke different parts of the Scripture for different 
uses—some for instruction, some for encouragement, some for 
reproof. So digesting food means to send part to make bone, 
part to make blood, part to make brain, and so on. 
12, certain, sc. regular. Milton is evidently of opinion that 
the regular grammar should be studied first, the irregular part 
afterwards. 
14. praxis. _The Greek zpafs means practice ;—use of the 
grammatical forms. Sometimes the word has the meaning of 
an exercise book. 
15, _lessoned throughly, taught thoroughly in lesson. Through 
is really the same word as thorough. This adverb is obsolete. 
Cf. Psalm, li. 2, ‘© Wash me throughly from nine iniquity.” 
16. substance of good things, p. 5, 1. 7, things as well as 
words. 
_ 17. Arts, here used in a technical University sense, as in the 
names of the degrees B.A. and M.A., and in the Middle Ages 
there were two courses—trivium, grammar, logic rhetoric, and 
the quadrivium, arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. 
“Arts” here includes the substance of all these, though later 
Milton rails against the order. Milton holds that if the sub- 
* stance of these Arts be learnt in Latin, the Latin words and 
Page 7. turns of speech will be learnt incidentally. 
1.1. Scholastic. The school men were the philosophers of the 
Middle Ages, usually also theologians. Much of their time was 
spent on the discussion of nice refinements of metaphysical 
speculation. Milton, writing whilst the reaction against schol- 
asticism was still strong, though it was about two centuries
-P-A-G-E-82

after the Renaissance, speaks more violently than modern Page 7. 
writers do. It is not considered right now to speak. of the 
“ grossness of barbarous ages.” 
3. most obvious to the sense. We should say “the senses,” 
Later reformers of education, such as Pestalozzi, hold this view 
strongly. We should begin with what appeals to the senses: 
therefore, of the seven Arts of the earlier curriculum, not with 
grammar, but with music for the hearing, astronomy and 
geometry for the sight. 
4, unmatriculated, curiously technical, Matriculation is the 
technical term for admission to a University. Matricula is 
Latin for a register, diminutive of matrix, which is used in the 
same sense, being literally a parent-stock. Milton’s scheme 
of Education set out in this Tractate is really a scheme for a 
new University. He means, then, that Logie and Metaphysics 
should not be taught at school, but kept for the University. 
All will agree about Metaphysics. As to Logic the followin, 
passage from Thomas Fuller: ‘‘Holy and Profane State,” Book - 
U., chap. xvii., The Good, Schoolmaster, p. 102 (a book pub- 
lished a year before Milton’s Tractate), may be quoted: “ He 
spoils not a good school, to make thereof a bad College, therein 
to teach his scholars Logic. For besides that Logic may have 
an action of trespass against grammar for encroaching on her 
liberties, syllogisms are solecisms taught in the school; and 
oftentimes they are forced afterwards, in the university, to 
unlearn the fumbling skill they had before.” 
5, novices, one who is new in any business, from novitius, a 
late form of Latin novus, new. e word is especially used 
during a period of probation of one who enters a religious house 
as a monk or nun. . 
intellective, another form of ‘intellectual,’ what can be 
grasped by the understanding, but not by the senses. 
6. Logic, the acience of exact reasoning, of the laws of thought.

ae not be known of being and the laws of being” (Cole- ridge).

pared with Logic and Metaphysics.

after grammar. The name Sophist is always opposed to philo- sopher ; yet Liddell and Scott (s.v.) say—‘‘ Many of the Sophists doubtless cared not for truth or morality, and merely professed 
to teach how to make the worse appear the better reason; but there seems no reason to hold that they were a special class, teaching special opinions ; even Socrates and Plato were some- times styled Sophists.” The word occurs in Chaucer, Legend of 
Good Women, 137: 
“Had him betrayed with his sophistrye.” 
The word ‘sophist’ was new, and it is probable that Milton was — not borrowing from Chaucer, nor from the French, but taking 
‘sophist’ from.Greek, and adding a termination.

the word has been abused, and is now in discredit. At page 21,

9. practitioners. This word has a double ending ; ‘practician’ 
was enough without the ‘er.’ Chaucer more correctly has 
“practisour’ (Prol. 422). Here it applies to lawyers as well as 
doctors. - : 
11, Lilly. When Dean Colet founded St. Paul’s School in 
London, William Lilly was his first headmaster (see Séebohm, 
Oxsord Reformers, p. 220). The Latin grammar, which went by 
the name of Lilly’s Grammar, was really Colet’s, published after 
revision by Erasmus and Lilly. The grammar was evidently 
still in use at St. Paul’s when, more than a century after its 
foundation, Milton was a boy at the school. 
commence, a technical University term for taking a degree. 
Commencement is a Degree Day. : 
17. civility, good citizenship. Milton has in the Introduction 
to Church Government, ‘To inbreed and cherish ina great people 
the sense of virtue and public civility.” Knowing Milton’s pub- 
lic spirit, I think this is the sense, but ‘civility’ is used in the 
sense of the modern word ‘ culture.’ 
25, Grammar. From what follows it is evident that Milton is 
thinking not of English grammar, but of Latin. That ‘‘now 
used” would be Lilly’s. See above 1, 11.

It is not certain that the Pinaz (rivag, a table), now extant and 
once very popular, is genuine. It is a ‘philosophical explana- 
tion of a table, on which the whole of human life, with its 
dangers and temptations, was symbolically represented. .. 
The author introduces some youths contemplating the table, and 
an old man who steps among them undertakes to explain its 
meaning. The whole drift of the little book is to show that only 
the proper development of our mind by. the possession of real 
virtues can make us truly happy ” (Smith’s Dict.).

“Can it mean the ‘old, accepted’? More likely Milton is 
probably thinking of the Greek word isropla, which meant 
‘inquiry’ or ‘investigation.’ The title of Aristotle’s book on

2. Solinus, compiler of a not very valuable account of the 
world, chiefly drawn from Pliny’s Historia Naturalis, Solinus

Saumaise or Salmasius, edited Solinus.

14. the tempers, the humours. The two words mean the 
same thing. According to ancient theories of medicine, man 
had within him four humours—black bile, Yellow bile, blood, 
and phlegm. The mixture of these was called. his temperament, 
or temper (Latin tempero, mix). The Greek was ovyxpasis, hence 
our idiosyncrasy. If the mixture was in good proportions the 
man was said to be good-tempered, or good-humoured. If one or 
other humour preponderated, then he was (1) melancholy, sad 
(Greek pédas, black, xédn, bile), or atrabilious (Latin form with 
same meaning), (2) choleric, violent (x6An), (3) sanguine, hopeful, 
or (4) phlegmatic, dull. Mischief in the body was traced to the 
presence of humours, and a trace of the theory is to be seen in 
the names Gout and Rheumatism. 
15. the seasons, 7.¢. from a medical point of view, ‘when to

4. apothecaries. The word is now archaic. ‘Chemist’ is the 
word generally used in England; ‘druggist’ in the United 
States, where ‘chemist’ is reserved for the scientific student of 
chemistry. The Greek dwofjxy means ‘a store.’ The word 
» ‘apothecary’ comes through Old French and Late Latin, and meant 
originally ‘one who kept a store or shop of such commodities as 
spices and drugs.’ For two centuries an apothecary has been 
a legally qualified medical practitioner. Before 1700 he was 
simply a seller of drugs. Cf. Chaucer, Prol. 425: 
« Ful redy hadde he (the doctour of Phisik) his apothecaries, 
To send hin drogges, and his letuaries, 
For ech of hem made other for to winne.”

13. Orpheus. An Epic poem called the Argonautica, a poem 
Lithica on precious stones, and a number of hymns, were long 
believed to be the work of Orpheus, the minstrel of whom 
/ various stories are told; see note, p. 9, 1.4. It is now known 
that the poems are forgeries of a date much later than the time 
of Orpheus, if he ever existed. 
Hesiod, author of Works and Days, chiefly concerned with 
agriculture and similar matters, was either contemporary with 
Homer, or lived within one hundred years of his time. 
Theocritus, a native of Sicily, the creator of bucolic poetry. 
His poems are called idylls, and about a third of them deal with 
country life. 
14, Aratus wrote two poems on Astronomy. He and Nicander 
lived in the third century 3.0. 
Nicander wrote a poem on venomous animals called 
Theriaka, He wrote many other poems now lost, including a 
Georgica. 
Oppian. There were two poems written by a poet with 
this name—the Halieutica and the Cynegetica. t is now 
believed that they were not by the same writer. The Halicutica 
(d@cevrixd), a poem on fishes and fishing, was probably written in 
the latter half of the second century of our era. The other, a 
poem on hunting, was probably about a generation later.

11. Economics. Readers must not give the word a modern 
meaning. . Nowadays this plural substantive is often used as equi- 
valent to ‘Political Economy,’ the very rudiments of which science 
were only appearing in Milton’s time. It was then called 
*Policical Arithmetic.’ The name Political Economy is not 
one hundred and thirty Pen old. Milton means ‘the art of 
managing a household.’ Had he attached importance to spelling 
he would. have written (Economics {olxovéuiKat). 
And either ... Italian tongue. Probably the best remem-

8. Edicts, sc. of the Praetors. One learned in Roman Law 
gives me the following note: The Praetor during the Republic 
was the magistrate principally concerned in the administration 
of justice. Like the other superior magistrates he had the 
power of issuing edicts in matters within his office. The system 
of law which he administered was that of the Twelve Tables, a 
compilation which was made at an unusually early stage of 
“social development, and thus necessarily soon became unfitted

vation, and legislation other than by way of declaration of the 
law.is almost unknown. A mitigation of the evils of an archaic 
system of law was found in the power of the Praetor. He had a 
wide discretion in the giving of actions, and soon used it’ to 
supplement the statute or to cover omitted cases, and eventually 
succeeded in effect in amending the law in the more glaring 
cases of injustice. The rules according to which this discretion 
would be exercised were embodied in an edict issued on the 
assumption of office ; and by the end of the Republic two rules 
were established—that. a Praetor was bound not to alter his 
edict during his year of office, and that a Praetor must not 
lightly depart from the edict of his predecessor. Thus there 
grew up a definite body of law alongside the law of the Twelve 
Tables, distinct in many respects, but administered as part of it 
and in the same tribunal. It was upon the edict that most of 
the speculations of the jurists were based, and its equitas was

has been handed down under the name of an orator of the latter 
half of the fourth century, B.c., Demetrius of Phalerus (a deme 
of Attica), but which more probably was the work of another 
Demetrius, an Alexandrine grammarian of the second century of 
our era. 
16. Cicero wrote various treatises on Rhetoric, 
Hermogenes, one of the most celebrated Greek rhetoricians, 
a native of Tarsus, who lived in the second century of our era. 
When a young man he wrote several books on Rhetoric, which 
are extant, but are now very little used. 
Longinus, a Greek philosopher of the third cent: of our 
era. He is best remembered as the adviser of Zenobia, Queen of 
Palmyra. The book here referred to is a treatise, zepi Gyous, On 
the Sublime. The homage which Longinus used to receive for 
this treatise is well shown in the lines of Pope, Hssay on Criti- 
cism, 675 : : 
“Thee, bold Longinus ! all the Nine inspire, 
And bless their critic with a poet’s fire : 
An ardent judge, who, zealous in his trust, 
With warmth gives sentence, yet is always just ; 
‘Whose own example strengthens all his laws, 
And is himself that great sublime he draws.” 
Doubt has been cast upon Longinus’ authorship of the famous 
treatise. There is no good evidence that he wrote it; and 
“opinion,” says Mr, Andrew Lang, ‘still floats undecided about 
its origin and period.” He inclines to the belief that it is, “if 
not by Plutarch, at least by some author of his age, the age of 
the early Caesars.” On the other hand, many good scholars hold 
that the style of the Greek is a strong argument for the old belief 
that the book is, after all, by Zenobia’s tutor. 
19, simple, sensuous and passionate. These epithets, applied 
by Milton to poetry, are often quoted: ‘appealing to the senses,’ 
‘rousing the passions.’ .

play-writers. Did Milton mean to include Shakspere and

“Then to the well-trod stage anon, 
If Jonson’s learned sock be on, 
Or sweetest Shakespear, fancy’s child 
Warble his native wood-notes wild.” 
Shakspere had been dead twenty-eight years, It was fourteen 
years since the Second Folio had appeared, and Ben Jonson was 
but seven ver dead. Milton’s contempt for English literature 
is followed by his contempt for English preachers, perhaps the 
greatest of whom was Milton’s contemporary, Jeremy Taylor.

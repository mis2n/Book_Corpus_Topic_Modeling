SECRETARY’S REPORT. 
Mosiiy, ALABAMA, Thursday, February 23, 1911. 
  To the Board of Directors of the S. E. A., Mobile, Alabama: 
Dear Sirs—I beg to submit the following report of my work 
as Secretary of the S. E. A. since my election on December 29, 
1910, as follows: 
In accordance with your wishes, Mr. E. P. Burns and your 
Secretary remain over in Chattanooga for the purpose of box- 
ing and shipping the proceedings in the hands of the former 
Secretary, Mr. Bierly, and securing the books and records in 
his hands. It was found impracticable for us to remain long 
enough to secure these, and arrangements were made by which 
the proceedings were to be sent to the Secretary at Mont- 
gomery. After considerable correspondence and telegraphing, 
the following proceedings were sent to your Secretary: 
         
      
  
  Place of Meeting. Date of Meeting. No. of Copies. 
Memphis, Tenn-__- .-December 27-29, 1899____ 52

Columbia, S. C. December 26-29, 1901__ 100 
Asheville, N. C June 30-July 3, 1903__- = 180 
Atlanta, Ga _--December 30, 1903-January 1, 1904_________ 33 
Jacksonville, Fla__-.--_- December 29-31, 1904____ 
Nashville, Tenn__ November 22-24, 1905- 
_ Montgomery, Ala November 27-29, 1906_ 
Lexington, Ky_ December 26-29, 1907__ 
Atlanta, Ga____ .-December 29-31, 1908____    
        Besides the above proceedings, forty volumes of the Imperial 
Encyclopedia Dictionary were sent, and the former Secretary 
states that these books were received by him in payment for ad- 
vertising in the Official Program of the Association at Char- 
lotte. 
Judging from the calendar of meetings in the Atlanta Pro- 
ceedings, the S. E. A. held its first meeting in 1890. I have no 
Proceedings whatever of this meeting, and neither have I any 
Proceedings of the meetings in 1891, 1892, 1893, 1894, 1895, 
2
-P-A-G-E-18
18 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  1896, 1898 and 1902. No meeting was held in 1897 in New Or- 
leans on account of the yellow fever. 
Your former Secretary turned over to me no record books of 
any kind, and very little data or information which has been of 
service to me. It seems that all the records were kept either on 
note books or not at all. The little information I have secured 
from the former Secretary has not been given to me freely, and 
what I have secured has been gotten after continued corre- 
spondence. 
As soon as I returned to Montgomery after the Chattanooga 
meeting, a circular letter under a two-cent stamp was sent to 
every one whose name appeared on either the program of the 
Charlotte meeting in 1909, or the Chattanooga meeting in 1910, 
requesting that a typewritten copy of their papers be sent to me 
immediately. I have with me the papers secured, and I trust 
that they will be referred to the proper committee at this meet- 
ing, in order that the Proceedings of the Charlotte and Chatta- 
nooga meetings may be printed immediately. 
Your Secretary took the Official Program of the Chattanooga 
meeting and estimated the cost of each advertisement in it ac- 
cording to a circular letter sent out by the former Secretary, 
Mr. Bierly, which circular letter was accidentally found in 
some old papers. A special letter was written to each of the 
advertisers and $1,098.30 have been collected (see Exhibit 
“A”). Of this amount $487.00 have been sent to the Treasurer, 
Mr. E. P. Burns (see Exhibit “B”), and the balance, $611.30, 
was retained by your Secretary. In addition to the $611.30, I 
have received $2.00 membership fee from Mr. D. A. Graves of 
Chattanooga, and $25.00 from Mr. E. P. Burns, the Treasurer 
(to be spent for stamps), making a total of $638.30 received by 
me. I spent $140.85 for necessary incidental expenses con- 
nected with my work as Secretary, and I’ have on hand at this 
time a balance of $497.45 (see Exhibit “C”). I have itemized 
accounts properly receipted for the money spent by me, and I 
have also the cancelled checks from the bank as additional 
vouchers. 
The total amount of the advertisements in the Official Pro- 
gram for 1910 is $2,572.75. As stated above, $1,098.30 of this 
amount was collected by me and $901.45 was collected by the 
former Secretary, Mr. Bierly (see Exhibit “D”’), and $573.00
-P-A-G-E-19
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 19 
  remains uncollected, unless some of this latter amount has been 
paid to Mr. Bierly without my knowledge. Of the $573.00 un- 
collected, I think about $81.00 of it will be paid in cash. 
Mr. Bierly has sent to me receipts for moneys amounting to 
$770.98 (see Exhibit “E”), but, as stated above, he collected 
$901.45 from the 1910 Official Program. I have in my hands 
the receipts as sent me by Mr. Bierly, and I presume these re- 
ceipts were for various incidental expenses connected with his 
work as Secretary, but all of the receipts themselves do not indi- 
cate clearly this fact. 
Many bills have been sent me by various parties and the total 
amount of these accounts is $2,374.72 (see Exhibit “F”). 
I know nothing whatever about the accuracy of these ac- 
counts and [ doubt very much whether the Association should 
pay all of them. I suggest, at least, that each account be care- 
fully investigated before it is paid. 
I wish also to call attention to the fact that the former Sec- 
retary has collected many membership fees, for which no ac- 
counting has been made to me. Letters have been received from 
different parties, stating that checks or money orders have been 
sent to Mr. Bierly and that copies of the Proceedings have never 
been received. Mr. Bierly claims that the Atlanta Proceedings 
have been sent to nearly all of those deserving them, but I still 
have many calls for copies of the Proceedings. Your Secretary 
has not sent out any Proceedings, as he did not know who was 
entitled to them. 
Exhibit “G” will show you a statement of the unpaid funds 
of those who advertised in the Official Program of the S. E. A., 
and I have with me correspondence indicating the exact status 
of each advertiser. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Ws. F. Faacin, Secretary.

Mr. Burns and Mr. Graves shall send a statement with vouchers prop- 
erly arranged to the Chairman of the Auditing Committee (P. P. Clax- 
ton), and that they demand of Mr. Bierly a complete statement of all

was selected by the Board of Directors to edit the papers for 
these proceedings.

that we sell all old volumes of the Proceedings at a dollar a 
volume, reserving twenty copies of each’s year’s Proceedings.

justify.

  22, SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Houston, Texas, November 30, 1911. 
To the Board of Directors of the 8. EH. A., Houston, Tewas: 
Dear Sirs—I beg to submit the following report of my work 
as Secretary of the S. E. A. since the last meeting of the Board 
of Directors in Mobile, February 23, 1911: 
Immediately after the meeting of the Board of Directors in 
Mobile, the papers which had been secured from those who were 
on the programs of the Charlotte and Chattanooga meetings 
were sent by express to President M. A. Cassidy, and they were 
returned to me with the request that I issue the following cir- 
cular, which was done on March 18, 1911: 
Lexineton, Ky., March 18, 1911. 
To WHom rr May CONCERN: 
Owing to the delinquency of the former Secretary of the Southern 
Educational Association, the Proceedings of the Charlotte, N. C., meet- 
ing have not yet been published. It is the sincere desire of the present 
officers of the Association to issue, at the earliest possible time, both the 
Charlotte and the Chattanooga Proceedings in two separate volumes. 
Because of an unwise and perhaps unwarranted expenditure of the 
Association’s funds by the former Secretary, the amount that can be 
expended on these publications is necessarily limited, and in order to 
meet the unpleasant—yes, embarrassing—exigency that has been forced 
upon the Association, it is found necessary to publish the papers read 
at Charlottte and Chattanooga in a greatly abridged form. This is 
much to be regretted, for, having, read these papers, I am impressed 
with both their thought and style of presentation, and am exceedingly 
sorry that each one cannot appear as originally written. 
It was it first contemplated, and was so ordered by the Board of 
Directors, that I should edit and condense all of the papers read on the 
two occasions referred to. The papers were sent to me for this pur- 
pose, but on beginning the work I was soon convinced that it was a task 
which no one could perform with satisfaction, either to himself or to the 
authors. It would be taking too much liberty with the fine thoughts of 
others. And upon mature reflection, I have concluded that in justice 
to the authors these excellent papers should be returned to them, and 
that they should be requested to rewrite them as briefly as possible. 
I feel sure of the cheerful codperation of each writer in this embar- 
rassing situation and earnestly request that he rewrite his paper, incor- 
porating nothing that is not absolutely essential to preserve the thought 
and unity of the production. In other words, make it as brief as pos- 
sible. 
If each contributor will do this at once, and return the condensed 
production to Mr. Wm. F. Feagin, Secretary of the Southern Educational 
Association, Montgomery, Ala., at the earliest possible moment, the Pro-
-P-A-G-E-23
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 23 
ceedings will be printed as soon thereafter as possible and promptly 
sent to the members of the Association, Please bear in mind, in rewrit- 
ing your paper, to preserve only essentials, to have the rewritten paper 
typewritten, and to return immediately to the Secretary at Montgomery, 
as stated in the previous paragraph. 
All who have not returned their papers by April 3, 1911, will be con- 
sidered as not desirous of having them printed, since the Proceedings 
must be in the hands of the printers not later than April 10, 1911. I 
beg to assure you that you will greatly assist us by complying promptly, 
if not cheerfully, with this request, and that no such contingency will 
arise after the next meeting. 
Assuring you of my gratitude and asking your hearty codperation 
for the future success of the Association, I am, 
With great respect, 
(Signed) M. A. Cassipy, 
President Southern Educational Association. 
  With one or two exceptions every one complied with the con- 
tents of the above circular, and the Proceedings for 1909 and 
1910 were printed and copies of the 1910 Proceedings were sent 
to all who were members of the Association in 1909, and copies 
of the 1910 Procedings were sent to all who were members in 
1910. These proceedings were sent by express prepaid. Four 
hundred and fifty copies of the 1909 Proceedings and 450 copies 
of the 1910 Proceedings were printed at a cost of $835, and the 
expressage was $79.78, making a total cost of $914.78 for the 
printing and sending out of the Proceedings for the years of . 
1909 and 1910. The Secretary had much difficulty in getting 
these Proceedings in the hands of the membership, as so many 
of them had changed their addresses and could not be located. 
This was especially true of the membership for 1909. 
After a conference with President Cassidy in Louisville, Ky., 
on July 11, 1911, it was decided that President Cassidy would 
look after and be responsible for the general program, and that 
your Secretary would do the best he could with the department 
programs. The various departments of the Association were 
very much disorganized and several of the officers could not be 
heard from. After communicating with President Cassidy, and 
with his approval, the places of those officers who could not be 
heard from were filled by the appointment of other officers. We 
could find no authority for such action, but something had to 
be done. A few of the Presidents of the departments prepared 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
24 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
the programs of their respective departments, but many of the 
programs were prepared by your Secretary. It is unnecessary 
to say to you that much difficulty was encountered not only in 
preparing the programs, but also in making the assignments. 
The programs this year were printed complimentary for the 
Association by Silver, Burdett & Company. Five thousand 
copies of the preliminary program were printed and distributed 
over the territory of the S. E. A. between October 13 and Octo- 
ber 20, and 7,500 copies of the final program were printed and 
5,500 of these were distributed over the territory of the S. #. A. 
between November 10 and November 20, 2,000 rene shipped to 
Houston for use at the annual meeting. 
We have on file in the office of the Secretary at this time the 
following back proceedings:

By your direction, several of the back volumes were sold at 
$1.00 each, and the exact number may be learned by comparing 
the above with my report to you of the proceedings on hand at 
the last meeting of the Board of Directors in Mobile. 
I have with me a statement of the unpaid accounts against 
the Association made by the former Secretary, H. E. Bierly. 
These accounts amount to $2,608.28, and they were made by Mr. 
Bierly during the years 1909 and 1910. 
Your Secretary has kept an accurate account of all receipts 
and disbursements during this year, and has kept all funds in 
the bank and paid all items by check. I have with me all of 
my record books, vouchers, etc., and I shall thank you to ap- 
point a committee to carefully check and report on them during

During the year hundreds of letters have been written, and I 
have made it a point to reply to every communication which 
came to me. By means of the use of a Gammeter Multigraph 
many circulars have been sent out with only the cost of the 
paper used. While results have not been altogether as satisfac- 
tory as he would have liked them to be, your Secretary has the 
consciousness of knowing that he has done the best he could 
under the circumstances.

upon new membership to be secured for that State and to be applied to 
the liquidation of the indebtedness of the Association. 
  On motion, a resolution was passed authorizing and direct- 
ing the Secretary-Treasurer to make such adjustments of the 
indebtedness of the Association as he deems best and proper. 
There being no further business the meeting adjourned.

PROCEEDINGS 
OF THE 
TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL CONVENTION, 
SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION, 
HOUSTON, TEXAS, NOVEMBER 30, 
AND DECEMBER 1, 2, 1911. 
(Reported by Mrs. Benigna G. Kalb, Crockett, Tew.) 
FIRST SESSION. 
Maszstic THEATER, THURSDAY ForEnoon, 9:00 O’CiocK. 
THE PRESIDENT, M. A. CASSIDY, PRESIDING. 
  Prior to the regular opening of the session, the audience was 
delightfully entertained by a chorus composed of children from 
the first, second and third grades of the Taylor School, Hous- 
ton, under the direction of Miss Winnifred M. Shumway, Musi- 
cal Supervisor. The two numbers rendered were, “Thanksgiv- 
ing” and “Awakening” by Gaynor. The children had been 
trained by Miss Helen DeChaumes, Primary Teacher in the Tay- 
lor School. 
Tun Cuair: Ladies and Gentlemen and Fellow Teachers: 
I am happy today, and I am sure that every educator here 
experiences the same pleasurable emotion. Parents who have 
nursed and trained a child to vigorous manhood know what 
that emotion is. It is the sweet reward of anxiety, labor and 
hope. 
Organized twenty-two years ago, when popular education had 
feeble hold upon the intelligence and affection of our people, the 
Southern Educational Association has required tender nursing, 
much labor and unflagging devotion to a great cause. But these 
have brought the reward of success, and the Association’s sta- 
bility is now assured. The vision of its founders is realized. 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 33 
  That the Southern Educational Association has been a 
mighty force in the development, uplift and progress of popu- 
lar education in the South, no one can deny. Through it, higher 
educational ideals have been promulgated. In its publications 
the best educational thought and action have been made gen- 
eral. Through its influence the standard of the teaching pro- 
fession has been raised. Ever taking a bold stand in speech and 
resolution for every child’s right to the better chance that comes 
through training, such has become the almost universal desire of 
the South. By its influence, school architecture has been gen- 
erally improved and teachers are better paid. Through its 
counsel the schools are relating themselves to every phase of life 
—moral, social, physical and industrial. 
But the Southern Educational Association has a greater 
work still to accomplish. It cannot rest upon its laurels. In 
the program of this meeting, some of the important things to be 
done are outlined. We must raise the standard of Southern 
intelligence and efficiency by training all of the South’s chil- 
dren, white and black. It is our duty, as promoters of civiliza- 
tion, to influence the training of future homemakers in the right 
direction, that these units of government may influence the 
whole nation. It is our duty to assist in giving the children of 
the mountains a chance through education. This is true, also, 
of the children of the factories. This Association must promote 
industrial training of every character in both city and country. 
It must influence a better citizenship through moral and civic 
training. The accomplishment of these things should be the 
constant aim. 
Every member of the teaching profession in the South should 
join this Association. In the multitude of council there is wis- 
dom. By becoming an active member, he will not only give 
timely financial assistance, but such a direct interest will make 
him a greater force in promoting the high aims of the Associa- 
tion. The widow’s mite not only helped a noble cause, but it 
rendered the giver famous. A word to the wise is sufficient. 
Let us make this session of the Association the very begin- 
ning of better things in the educational life of the South. Let 
us be enthusiastic during this meeting. Let us attend, not only 
the general sessions, but also the departmental meetings, in 
which you will find even better things than we will have here.

34 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
When I was a boy I attended an old-fashioned Methodist re- 
vival. Those of you who live in this generation perhaps do not 
know the meaning of those occasions. It meant emotion, en- 
thusiasm, and a great deal of intelligence. During the revival 
I have in mind, one of my neighbors got religion. He had an- 
other neighbor who had a large peach orchard. The owner of 
the orchard, Mr. Hunt, was applied to by this man, who asked 
if he might have a load of peaches. Mr. Hunt being a neigh- 
borly man, and kind hearted, told him, “Yes, to drive in and get 
a load.” This Mr. P- did, and after he had filled the 
wagon bed, he put up the sideboards and filled those, taking 
nearly all the peaches. During the revival, when Mr. P. 
got religion, he rose from the mourner’s bench and shouted loud 
and long. Giving one shout that would have been worthy of 
a warrior Indian, he said, “Thank God! I am full and running 
over with glory!” Then it was Mr. Hunt got in his word. Ris- 
ing from his seat, with everybody looking and listening to learn 
what he would say, he said: “Mr. P., I would advise you to put 
up your spiritual sideboards!” (Laughter .and applause.) 
Now, let us become so full of enthusiasm and the spirit of this 
occasion that we will be required to put up our spiritual side- 
boards! (Applause.) 
We will now listen to the Address of Welcome by the Mayor 
of Houston, Hon. H. B. Rice. (Applause.) 
ADDRESS OF WELCOME. 
H, B. RICE, HOUSTON, TEXAS. 
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
It seems to me that on this balmy day of Thanksgiving, no 
convention of men and women could be more appropriate than 
the one which is assembled here. We often welcome to this city 
our friends and large conventions, but it seems to me this is of 
more than passing moment, for the very foundation and pros- 
perity of our country depends upon the intelligence of its peo- 
ple. (Applause.) To secure that and maintain it, we must 
look to the educators of our country. 
Houston claims to have an up-to-date public free school sys- 
tem. This is due to our fine superintendent and corps of teach- 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 35 
ers. A few years ago when the people of Houston asked me to 
take charge of the new form of government here, I asked what 
kind of a public school superintendent they had. I was told 
that he was a good, pious man; a good educator, and superin- 
tendent of a Sunday school. I said if that was the case I need 
not be afraid, for he would know nothing about financial affairs. 
But I will say here that he has worked more money out of the 
city government than any other official. He has caused a great 
many new schoolhouses to be erected, and after those were built, 
he said to me, “Now, we want manual training.” I asked, 
“What is manual training? What do you want to do with 
that? I used to get manual training with a hickory switch!” 
(Laughter.) Then we held a meeting and concluded to let him 
have manual training. In a few months he came back and 
wanted domestic science. I asked what that was. He replied, 
that it was to teach girls to cook and keep house; so he got that. 
Now he is working on us to establish kindergartens. The ladies 
I have talked with favor it, but some of the men are of the opin- 
ion that they are for the purpose of leaving the ladies free to 
spend their time playing bridge whist. I don’t know about that 
myself. 
Houston is proud to have you here. We want you to look 
around this growing, prosperous city while here, and see what 
we are doing. Our streets are so torn up because of so many 
buildings being erected that it may not look good to you, but 
this, of course, is due to the tremendous prosperity and growth 
of the city. This weather is something unusual for this section 
at this season, and it will not last long. When it does thaw out, 
we want you to hold your convention in that splendid audi- 
torium which has been built by the generosity of the citizens of 
Houston. 
Again, I welcome you to our city! (Applause.) 
Tue Cuair: Ladies and Gentlemen: It has been said that 
he who bloweth not his own horn, the same shall not be blown! 
We will give the opportunity to P. W. Horn, Superintendent 
of the Public Schools of Houston. (Great laughter and ap- 
plause. )

ADDRESS OF WELCOME. 
  P. W. HORN, HOUSTON, TEXAS. 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
We are most pleased to welcome this body here, and I might 
say that we have already begun to learn things. We have 
learned that in certain quarters the custom of holding Meth- 
odist revivals has become extinct. We did not know that. We 
have so many in Texas that we did not know they had gone out 
of date in other parts of the country; but we are glad to know 
that they did at one time have a revival of religion in Kentucky 
and that one of the neighbors of our President got religion! 
(Laughter). We are glad to know it—and hope he still lives! 
(Laughter and applause.) 
I was glad to hear the talk our Mayor made. It was a good 
talk in many respects, though I am quite confident it is not so 
good as I have heard him make on one or two other occasions. 
I heard him make a talk on one occasion, when he-said we were 
going to have a new high school building and his talk was 
greeted with tremendous applause; and I heard him make a 
speech on another occasion, when he said he thought the Super- 
intendent’s salary ought to be raised! (Laughter and ap- 
plause. ) 
Mr. Mayor, you spoke of the amount of money we have had, 
but I will say that it is not half as much as we hope to get under 
your administration ! 
The commission form of city government is one of the things 
which we are proud of in Houston. It has taken the schools 
out of politics. This is one of the things to which we can point 
with great pride. 
I have heard many addresses of welcome and responses. Some 
were brilliant, some were eloquent, some were profound, and 
some had one other quality which I will not mention right at 
the present time, but which is even more popular. Some of us 
cannot be brilliant, some are not orators, and we cannot always 
be profound, but we can all win popular approval with that 
other quality which I will mention in a minute. 
We are glad you are here and we are going to do everything 
we can for your comfort. We will do our best to have a good 
convention here.
-P-A-G-E-37
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 37 
  That quality which always makes an address of welcome 
popular—I am sure you have guessed it—is brevity. This has 
all been preliminary, and I am going to set an example now, and 
show you just how long an address of welcome ought to be. 
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, we are glad you are 
here: if we had not wanted you, we would not have asked for 
you. (Laughter and great applause.) 
Tur Cua: We are glad to hear from Professor Horn that 
it is still fashionable to get religion in Texas. Probably that 
accounts for the fact that we were unable to find anyone to con- 
duct devotional exercises here this morning! (Laughter.) 
Prorrssor Horn: They have all gone to Thanksgiving ex- 
ercises ! 
Tue Cuair: For the first time in our history, a lady will re- 
spond to the address of welcome. When you see her, I am sure 
you will say my choice was an excellent one; when you hear her 
you will simply be enthralled. 
It is my pleasure to present Mrs. Marguerite Matlock, of Ens- 
ley, Alabama. (Applause. ) 
Mrs. Matlock, on behalf of the Association, responded to the 
addresses of welcome in the following language: 
RESPONSE TO ADDRESSES OF WELCOME. 
MRS. MARGUERITD MATLOCK, BNSLEY, ALA. 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
I esteem it an honor to stand in this splendid presence and 
respond in behalf of the teachers of the South to this most cor- 
dial welcome. In the list of blessings for which we are thankful 
today, the privilege of partaking of your generous hospitality 
is written large. We are glad to come again to Texas, the State 
of magnificent proportions, of splendid achievement, and of bril- 
liant promise. We shall find a tonic in your atmosphere and 
shall catch something of your enthusiasm. It is good to be with 
those who do not acknowledge obstacles to progress. Whither- 
soever we turn we see evidence of your development, your pros- 
perity, and withal your culture and refinement. 
Texas has an unique and fascinating history. She has served 
under five flags, and furnishes the only example of a country’s

  voluntarily surrendering its own government and joining an- 
other. We are standing today not far from the hallowed spot 
where independence was won, and behold what was twice the 
capital of the Republic. Dr. Burleson, one of your distinguished 
educators of precious memory, states that the convention that 
framed the Declaration of Independence of Texas was composed 
of a greater per cent of college bred men than had ever assem- 
bled in a like capacity. The founders of this great common- 
wealth showed their appreciation of the importance of educa- 
tion by providing generously for her schools. As we look down 
these magnificent avenues, as we see your artistic homes, your 
beautiful churches, your great public buildings, and contem- 
plate your admirable public school system, we know that these 
early fathers have had worthy successors. 
Our own John T. Morgan, “The Father of the Isthmian Ca- 
nal,” in one of his public addresses said: “When we get the 
canal bill passed the front porch of the United States will be 
the Gulf of Mexico.” The great railroad builders of America 
are using every means to extend their lines to the centers of 
Southern activity and to reach Southern ports in order to win 
positions of advantage in this section, which they recognize is 
to be the center of the world’s greatest industrial interests. 
The tide of investment of American and foreign capital and the 
movements of population are turning southward as never be- 
fore, and wonderful things are in store for this section. 
But industrial progress and material prosperity are of no 
real value unless they are the outgrowth of truth and righteous- 
ness. Jesus, who exemplified the truth of his teachings as no 
one else ever did, said: “Seek ye first the kingdom of God 
and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto 
you.” 
I take it that the primary and fundamental purpose of educa- 
tion is to reveal the ideal man, which is God’s image and like- 
ness, and the object of this convention is to gain a clearer com- 
prehension of how to accomplish this highest of all under- 
takings. 
It is fundamental that the teacher himself shall be attuned 
to receive the spiritual message that comes to every listening 
heart, that he shall have the standard of the high calling of God 
always before him, in order that he may clear away the rubbish
-P-A-G-E-39

of false thories and methods, banish the phantoms of ignorance 
and superstition, and avoid the demoralizing effect of a dis- 
parity between theory and practice. The teacher who caters to 
the forces in a community that are influential in business, poli- 
tics, or social affairs because he thinks it expedient forfeits his 
right to a place in the schools. 
The founders of our government were fully persuaded in 
whom they put their trust, and while it wisely provided that 
our public schools shall be non-sectarian there is no law exclud- 
ing God, who is everpresent and omnipotent good and the source 
of all wisdom. When the teacher sees in the child the divine 
possibilities instead of a deformed and dwarfed mortal con- 
sciousness the child will look up and behold the principles of 
government, of supply, of harmonious and right living individ- 
ually and in relation to all mankind, which principles are ever 
present waiting to be discerned just as the principle underlying 
the telephone was always available though not discovered until 
recent years. He will solve the problem of demand and supply, 
of labor and capital, and of universal peace. 
So, friends and co-workers, as we gather here today from all 
parts of the South accepting the generous hospitality of this 
great State and city, we dedicate ourselves anew to the service 
of the cause we represent to the end that all the children of this 
beautiful land of ours may find access to infinite wisdom, from 
which proceeds all that is good and true and beautiful. (Ap- 
plause.) 
Tue Cuarr: It now gives me great pleasure to introduce to 
the Association, though he needs introduction, the old and tried 
educator, Dr. John W. Abercrombie, of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, 
who will address you upon the subject of “Southern Educa- 
tion.” (Applause.)

40 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
OUR GREATEST WEAKNESS. 
What is true of Texas is true in large measure of each of the 
States represented in this Association. In climate, soil, forests, 
minerals, streams, and other natural endowments, “the South 
has been favored by heaven o’er all the world beside.” We are 
lacking in only one thing—a citizenship whose masses have been 
adequately trained to live ethically and to utilize wisely and in 
fullest measure the natural advantages with which we have been 
blessed. 
In other words, our progress in educational achievement, ex- 
cept here and there, has not been such as to render possible the 
best of development—civic, social, economic and industrial. 
The census of 1900 disclosed conditions both surprising and dis- 
couraging, and we await with uneasiness the disclosures of the 
census of 1910, though we indulge the hope that it will show 
material advancement. This seems to be indicated by the pre- 
liminary reports. 
CONDITIONS AND TENDENCIES. 
  The educational policy of a State or section should be deter- 
mined after a thorough understanding of existing conditions 
and developing tendencies. Even a brief investigation discloses 
the fact that we are confronted with many untoward conditions, 
with many alarming tendencies. 
In every avenue of human activity the evils of unrestrained 
selfishness, the natural and inevitable results of low ethical 
standards, are manifesting themselves, and are influencing un- 
favorably all social, business, and governmental life—even re- 
ligious life itself. 
The home, the source and nursery of every civic and social 
virtue, and out of which grow the sweet and sacred relations 
and obligations of family life, is being perverted and polluted 
by the demoralizing influences of modern social standards. 
Marriage is ridiculed; its sacred vows are plighted but to be 
broken; and the divorce evil threatens to make of the home a 
veritable pandemonium. 
In the domain of business, success at any price is coming to be’ 
the motto. That which is not specifically prohibited by statute 
is regarded as permissible. Take every advantage under the 
law; if possible, evade the law; if necessary, violate the law—
-P-A-G-E-41
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 41 
this is the growing practice in the get-rich-quick business world, 
and in some sections is resulting in the marvelously rapid ac- 
cumulation of colossal fortunes, which stand as a menace to 
democratic institutions and threaten to shadow democratic 
ideals. 
Contention from within and criticism from without disturb 
the church. Those who by virtue of the high faith professed 
should ever be shining lights of Christian consistency, not in- 
frequently wallow in the mire of greed, licentiousness and dis- 
honor. An alarmingly large number of people act as if they 
were created to eat, sleep, breathe, glitter and pass away—as if 
it were all of life to live, all of death to die. 
SPIRIT OF LAWLESSNESS. 
The orderly and efficient administration of government is 
jeopardized. The spirit of lawlessness is prevalent. Disregard 
for law, man-made and God-given, is widespread in every State 
and section, but perhaps the most alarming phase in which the 
lawless spirit manifests itself in the South is that of homicide. 
The frequency, the recklessness, and the impunity with which 
human life is taken should bring fear and shame to every patri- 
otic citizen. In no other civilized country is human life so 
cheap. In pagan Japan even, it is valued ten times more highly. 
The most distressing feature of homicidal crime is that of the 
growing tendency to resort to acts of mob violence, for it dis- 
closes not only the existence of widespread disregard for human 
rights, but also a supreme lack of confidence in our courts of 
justice and those who administer them. At first, for justifica- 
tion of mob violence, the “usual cause” was assigned ; then, mur- 
der and other felonies; then, misdemeanors and trifling offenses ; 
then mere race membership. Both North and South, negroes 
have been lynched because they were negroes. Worse still, they 
have been taken from the officers of the law, even from the tem- 
ples of justice, and murdered; and this has been done when 
legal conviction and punishment were certain and imminent. 
Only a few days ago, in a neighboring State, a white man 
who was on trial was assassinated while in the courthouse, and 
almost in the presence of judge and jury. Within a recent 
period the Governor of a proud Southern State announced pub- 
licly that rather than perform his sworn official duty in a cer-  
-P-A-G-E-42
42 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  tain instance he would himself lead a mob. What a stupendous 
misconception of the functions of government? What a sad 
commentary upon our boasted civilization! What a crime 
against civilization! 
At first, lynching was infrequent; now it is frequent. Then 
only negroes and uninfluential whites were the victims; now 
people of character and standing, without regard to race or 
color, are executed. The mob spirit is no respecter of persons or 
institutions. 
Everywhere, both North and South, both East and West, 
there is excess of liberty, unbridled license, barbaric lawless- 
ness; and lax law enforcement is the bane of both State and 
nation. 
The trouble lies not with our form of government, but with 
people who constitute the government; not with our judicial 
system, but with those who administered the system. The 
trouble is with our standard of duty, which is a direct result 
of the character and attitude of our homes, our schools, and our 
churches. One is constrained to wonder if the court is to be 
superceded by the mob, if self-government is to prove a failure, 
if the result is to be complete anarchy—a drifting back into 
the darkness of barbarism. 
Oh, for a copious outpouring of the spirit of honesty and cour- 
age in the execution of our laws! Not until then will the high- 
est functions of government be fullly established. 
OUR EDUCATIOAL POLICY. 
These are some of the conditions; these, some of the ten- 
dencies of the times. It is clear that there must be a betterment 
of conditions, a reversal of tendencies. 
Our educational policy must be all-comprehensive in scope 
and extremely individualistic in application. History and rea- 
son teach us that it is only through the process of education 
that a people can be advanced in civilization and prepared for 
the highest form of self-government; that only through the cul- 
tivation of mind and heart can the masses be brought to a 
realization of the fact that violation of law, civil or moral, de- 
grades all who participate, even all who witness or condone; 
that mob violence under any circumstances is unjustifiable; 
that crime is not a preventive, but a producer of crime; that
-P-A-G-E-43
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 43 
lawlessness begets greater lawlessness; that hatred and revenge 
breeds hatred and revenge. 
Unwise and full of error is the contention that a man is under 
obligation to provide educational advantages for his own chil- 
dren, and his own children only. Woe unto that government 
which makes provision for poorhouse, courthouse, jail, peni- 
tentiary and scaffold, and at the same time neglects adequately 
to train its children for the responsibilities of citizenship! 
If there be a matter of supremest importance to a State, that 
matter is the establishment and maintenance therein of an ade- 
quately supported, efficiently administered, free public school 
system—a system which will guarantee to every child, poor and 
rich, white and black, city and country, native and foreignborn, 
such training of head and hand and heart as will fit it for intel- 
ligent, independent and patriotic citizenship, and as will qualify 
for successful effort in the domain of everyday life. 
This should be our educational policy; this our educational 
ideal. 
GROWTH AND THEORY. 
Each of the States has established a system of public schools, 
but this ideal has been attained in few, if any. Certainly no 
Southern State has reached that standard. 
Prior to the war between the States conditions in the South, 
civic, social and economic, were not such as to conduce to a de- 
velopment of the doctrine of universal education at public ex- 
pense. Not until the close of the period of reconstruction did 
that principle take deep root; and not until within a recent 
period did it become popular. Even now, when seekers after 
office are falling over one another in their advocacy of big ap- 
’ propriations and better schools, we have among us many peo- 
ple, some of great intelligence and wide influence, some of ex- 
alted position and extended popularity, who, if they do not 
openly oppose, are extremely lukewarm in their advocacy of 
government-supported schools for all the people. 
This attitude upon their part is due chiefly to the fear that 
the education of the negro will tend to disturb social, ‘political, 
and industrial conditions, and thereby render more acute the 
already tensely acute racial situation. That such fear exists, 
and that upon the part of many it is an honest apprehension, 
there can be no question.
-P-A-G-E-44
44 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
LABOR AND RACE PROBLEMS. 
Our policy relative to negro education has to do directly with 
several perplexing problems, among the most important of 
which are the labor problem and the problem of the races. 
Every section is engaged in the solution of a labor problem, and 
every section is coming to have an increasing interest in the 
solution of the problem of the races. 
To the South especially each of these problems calls for 
prompt and serious consideration. Alike to both races do they 
appeal, and so related, so inseparably interwoven are they, that 
it is impossible to consider them as distinct propositions. With 
us the labor problem is largely a race problem, and for the same 
reasons the race problem is largely a labor problem. 
On account of the enormous influx of people from other na- 
tions, the problem of labor as it relates to the entire country 
appears to be growing in complexity. Labor and capital seem 
to be destined to the waging of an unending contest; and at 
times the fierceness of the conflict shakes the foundations of 
government, threatens a disruption of business and industry, 
and presents an appalling spectacle of man’s inhumanity to 
man. Students of government, lovers of justice, friends of hu- 
manity, followers of the cross, all have been shocked and dis- 
mayed. 
The South’s labor problem is peculiar to the section, and 
grows out of the occupancy of the same territory by two dis- 
similar races, one of which was for generations under involun- 
tary servitude to the other. It would be useless to undertake to 
place the burden of blame for the existence of slavery. Suffice 
it to say that the sections were jointly responsible, and that so 
long as slavery was financially profitable, neither section ques- 
tioned either the ethics or the wisdom of its continuance. While 
its abolition was accomplished through the most stupendous ex- 
penditure of blood and treasure known to history, the peopte of 
both sections, of the South no less than of the North, rejoice 
that human slavery no longer exists. 
RESULTS OF SLAVERY. 
The negro was benefited by slavery. He got more from bond- 
age than did the white man. What did the negro get? He got 
release from barbarism, physical development, industrial train-
-P-A-G-E-45

  ing, the lesson of obedience, the example of the master, the Eng- 
lish language, the foundation of the home, the introduction to 
civilization, and the elevating influences of the Christian re- 
ligion. What did the white man get?- He got freedom from 
physical labor and mental exertion, the results of which are 
invariably habits of ease, idleness, dissipation, weakness, help- 
lessness. 
The effect of slavery upon labor was to degrade it—to degrade 
it in the estimation of each race. To the white man, labor, espe- 
cially physical exertion, came to be regarded as fit only for the 
slave. To the negro, it came to be looked upon as an attribute 
of slavery, and therefore to be despised and evaded. Is it any 
wonder that freedom brought to both races economic confusion 
and industrial disaster? The negro regarded it as freedom from 
work ; the white man as subjection to an ignoble existence. The 
natural, the inevitable result was many mistakes upon the part 
of each. Each suffers today from those mistakes, though many 
of them were committed almost a half century ago. 
But the Southern whites and blacks were not the only people 
who blundered in the beginning of freedom. The greatest of the 
mistakes of that exciting period was committed by those who 
administered the affairs of the Federal Government. The sud- 
den enfranchisement of three million of people steeped in igno- 
race and superstition, and who had received no preparation 
whatever for the grave and exacting duties of citizenship, was 
the colossal mistake of the age; and was as unfair to the ex- 
slave at it was unjust and cruel to his former master. It drove 
a poisoned dagger to the heart of the white South, and has re- 
tarded for all time, I fear, the civic growth and educational de- 
velopment of both races. It complicated, if indeed it did not 
create, the race problem. The disastrous effects of that stu- 
pendous error are still visible and burdensome. For nearly 
fifty years they have obscured the vision of men. 
THE RACE PROBLEM. 
And there is a race problem. Close our eyes to it as we may, 
try to evade it as we will, the problem remains. To teach two 
wholly dissimilar races to live in harmony and mutual helpful- 
ness upon the same soil, to develop without friction a race 
within a race, to establish a civilization within a civilization—
-P-A-G-E-46
46 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  that is the problem of the races. There has been nothing like it 
in history; there is no lamp of experience by which to guide our 
footsteps. 
The problem is not open to immediate, definite and complete 
solution. If it is ever solved, the solution will come through 
codperative efforts upon the part of intelligent, honest and 
patriotic representatives of both races and all sections. Great 
intelligence, unswerving honesty, unfaltering patriotism, wisest 
discretion, and untiring consecration will be necessary. There 
will be needed also much of toleration, patience, confidence, 
earnestness, courage and true religion. 
In other words, for the race problem, as with all other prob- 
lems, there is no solution outside of education. This education 
must be of the right kind, and it must be universally applied. 
I do not subscribe to the doctrine that the more ignorant a man 
is, the more efficient will be the service which he can or will ren- 
der. The most ignorant are not the most efficient, even in the 
performance of menial tasks. On the contrary, the most igno- 
rant are the most inefficient, and at the same time the most im- 
moral, the most criminal, and the most dangerous to society 
and government. This is true of indivdiuals, of races, of na- 
tions. 
In my opinion, we have made a great mistake in undertaking 
to provide for the negro, a race yet in the infancy of develop- 
ment, the same form of education as that administered to the 
Caucasian, a race advanced thousands of years in civilization. 
The food which is good for a babe in arms is very different from 
that required by an adult engaged in physical labor. 
It is my opinion also that it was a great mistake in the be- 
ginning of freedom for us to leave the negro so completely to 
himself and to outside influences in the matter of education, As 
a result of that mistake, the barrier between the races is gradu- 
ally widening, and one by one the former points of cleavage are 
disappearing. Soon the old-time bond of interest, confidence 
and sympathy will have passed away. 
In the consideration of the race problem we resent outside 
interference, outside suggestion, even outside codperation, claim- 
ing that we and we alone know the negro. Are we correct in 
this claim. Do we really know the negro? Who knows of the 
negro’s home life? Who has knowledge of what is taught him
-P-A-G-E-47
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 47 
in his schools? Who is familiar with the preachments from his 
pulpit? Who can conscientiously claim to possess all the facts 
necessary for a sane consideration of this greatest of problems? 
Every white home is jeopardized by the presence of the great 
horde of ignorant, superstitious, unclean, disease-breeding mem- 
bers of that race. The negro cooks our food, nurses our chil- 
dren, washes our clothing, tends our homes, and in self-defense, 
if not from a spirit of altruism and patriotism, it develops upon 
us, the dominant race, to see to it that he is taught how to live 
intelligently, morally and hygentically. He must be trained for 
his enviornment, and his education must be industrial, techni- 
cal and moral, rather than literary, professional and cultural. 
It is too late for us to retrace our steps and take complete 
charge of the education of the negro. We may not go into his 
schools and instruct his children; but, without doing great vio- 
lence to custom or tradition, might we not train the teachers 
who are to conduct his schools? It is believed that the adoption 
of such a policy would in the course of years work a revolu- 
tion in the economic and industrial conditions of the South- 
land. 
NATIONAL AID NECESSARY. 
  While each of the Southern States has recognized the neces- 
sity for universal education at public expense, while each is 
striving heroically to meet its obligations in that respect, and 
while each is making commendable progress under existing con- 
ditions, the task is only begun. Indeed, to students of eco- 
nomics, it is coming to be clear that the task of providing ade- 
quate educational facilities for all of the people, is beyond the 
ability of the South to perform. 
If the South were as wealthy and productive as other sec- 
tions of equal area and population, which is not true by reason 
of the ravages of war and the presence of the negro, it would 
require about one-half times their rate of taxation to give to 
her children advantages equal to those provided by other sec- 
tions for theirs, for the reason that the South is confronted 
with the irremovable necessity of maintaining a dual system of 
schools? To provide equal advantages under existing condi- 
tions would require a rate of taxation many times larger than 
that levied elsewhere. Such a rate would be oppressive, im- 
poverishing, confiscatory, and most of the burden would have 
to be borne by about one-half of the population. 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
48 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  If this be a correct diagnosis of the case, what is the remedy? 
I may be mistaken, but in the absence of action by the national 
government, I see no hope of prompt and effective relief. Con- 
gress must make an adequate annual appropriation for pur- 
poses of general education, to be apportioned among all of the 
States of the Union upon the basis of illiteracy, and to be ex- 
pended by the several States through the channels already estab- 
lished. Such apportionment would place most of the appropria- 
tion where it is most needed, and therefore where it would ac- 
complish the most good. 
The plan suggested would leave the direct administration of 
the fund with the individual States, where it properly belongs. 
Shall the Federal Government make appropriations for the 
building of locks and dams, for the deepening of rivers and dig- 
ging of canals, for the irrigation of arid lands, for the construc- 
tion of public highways, for farm demonstration purposes, for 
the eradication of the boll-weevil and the cattle-tick, and at the 
same time neglect the nobler and more important duty of pre- 
paring the masses of its people for citizenship? 
The educational problem peculiar to the South was created by 
the national government, and that government is in duty bound 
to assume its share of the work of solving that problem. To 
create a burden, and then neglect to refuse to assist in bearing 
that burden, is reprehensible; if deliberately done, it is not only 
reprehensible, but absolutely wrong and criminal. This is true 
of individuals; it is equally true of governments. 
If the continued inaction of the national government renders 
it necessary for one or both of the races to receive meager edu- 
cational advantages, it is best for all concerned that for a sea- 
son the advantage should go to the dominant race; because the 
best way to secure universal education for the negro is to give 
universal education to the white man. The more you educate 
people in the right way, the more willing and eager do they 
become to give education to others. 
Educate the white man properly, and the white man will edu- 
cate the negro. (Applause.)

THE NEED OF A NEW CONCEPTION OF A COMMON 
SCHOOL FOR THE SOUTH. 
DR. H. L. WHITFIELD, COLUMBUS, MISS. 
  For nearly half a century the South has had free schools. The 
first generation to go through these schools has largely done its 
work ; that in active service today is the product of these public 
schools. We may now study the work of this system by its re- 
sults, to see if the billion dollars the South has devoted to this 
cause has been wisely expended; if the best possible results have 
been obtained for the great amount of time and human effort 
that have been dedicated to this great undertaking; in fine, to 
see if from turret to foundation, the institution is as it should be. 
The writer realizes that the natural conservatism of human 
nature opposes even the suggestion of the possibility that any 
time-honored institution’s work is not all it should be. But, my 
friends, the stake is too large for us to let sentiment dominate 
us. If we are wise, we will look the situation squarely in the 
face; not for the purpose of finding fault with those who have 
wrought before us, but to see in the light of modern achievement 
if our great common schools cannot be made a better instru- 
ment for bringing about improved conditions among our people. 
To do this is no reflection upon the motives or work of those 
who have gone before us. The progress of civilization depends 
upon the succeeding generation’s analyzing the work of the 
former generation, retaining that which by experience has 
proved good, and rejecting that on which time has failed to put 
the stamp of its approval. ! 
So let us, as devoted and loyal sons of the South, without fear 
take up this great problem for the purpose that during the time 
of our stewardship we may contribute something to the pros- 
perity, happiness, honor and glory of the section we love so well. 
Any statement of the purpose of education both defines the 
term and determines the process. 
As to the general purpose of public education, there has never 
been any serious difference of opinion among recognized educa- 
tional thinkers. 
Maintained at public expense, public schools must rest the 
reason for their being in the contribution they make to the pub- 
lic good. 
4 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  50 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
In the light of its very reason for existence there can be but 
one logical definition for public education. It is the appointed 
agency through which organized society seeks to improve both 
itself and its conditions. 
All improvements in society and its conditions must come 
through improvement in the efficiency of the individual and in 
his relations and adjustment to his environment, natural and 
institutional. 
The fundamental condition of highest individual efficiency is 
perfect physical health and development. 
Adiustment to natural environment conditions in a knowl- 
edge of the Jaws of nature, and in power and skill in employing 
the forces and utilizing the material supplies of the natural 
world. 
Adjustment to institutional environment, in general, condi- 
tiors in adjustment to the two great fundamental institutions, 
the home and the State. 
Here we have the clearly defined channels through which 
whatever public education contributes to public good must 
manifest itself. 
' lay it down as a fundamental and indisputable proposition 
that the measure of the efficiency and worth of any form of pub- 
lic education is the extent to which it is able to bring about for 
each succeeding generation a better form of physical life, home 
life, industrial life, and civic life; and to establish more favor- 
able conditions for the next generation. 
The purpose of public education having been defined, and the 
specific forms in which its beneficial results must present them- 
selves having been determined, the question suggests itself: Are 
the public schools making good? Are they giving us the returns 
we have a right to demand? Is our investment in that direc- 
tion yielding the dividends we have a right to expect? Are the 
children of the South getting such a preparation for living as 
will compensate for the time, money and effort expended 
through this channel? Are they in those years that determine 
their characters and destinies receiving those impulses and that 
training and guidance which will mean for them the realization 
of their fullest possibilities? 
The results of one half century of public education are writ- 
ten in the social, civil and individual life of today. To answer 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 51 
  the preceding questions beyond cavil, we have but to read from 
the records as spread before us in the open book of present life- 
conditions. 
Tet us briefly glance at a page or two. What about our pres- 
ent life? Is it at all points, is it at any point, as it ought to 
be, and as it might have been? These are grave questions. They 
touch our pride and test our intellectual honesty, but the time 
has come when we should be perfectly frank with each other 
and with the situtation. The American people are rapidly ap- 
proaching a crisis. This is no time for compliments and self- 
praise. 
Taking up the items in turn, let us give them a brief examina- 
tion. How about public health? This is the fundamental ques- 
tion, since all others rest more or less upon it. The character 
and destiny of any people are in a large measure shaped and de- 
termined by their health and physical strength. Happiness and 
economic efficiency cannot be vouchsafed to any people who dis- 
regard or pay scant attention to their physical welfare. 
Are we enjoying the physical health, individually and col- 
lectively, that should be our portion? Preventable diseases still 
flourish and each year number their victims by the thousands. 
Typhoid fever, diphtheria, scarlet fever, hookworm and that 
most dreaded of all human scourages, consumption, are all pre- 
ventable; and yet some of them can be found at all times in 
every community. Are we then making the progress that we 
should make in driving them out? If they are preventable, why 
are we not preventing them? I am answered that it is due to 
popular ignorance that these diseases continue year by year to 
take their mighty toll of human life and impose their awful 
tribute of human sorrow. But at what door can the respon- 
sibility for this continued ignorance be laid, but at that of the 
public school? I am well aware of the noble efforts of health 
boards, medical associations and philanthropic individuals, to 
disseminate the necessary health-knowledge, and that they have 
not been without results, necessarily limited, however, on ac- 
count of lack of resources and organization, and of their having 
to deal largely with adults. 
Are our boys and girls getting in the public schools that 
physical instruction and training that mean well-developed 
bodies and robust health? A glance at the records of those col- 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
52 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  leges where physical examinations and measurements are re- 
quired, answers the question. These records stand as unimpeach- 
able witnesses of the absolute neglect of this most important 
phase of education in our common schools. 
Do our people need instruction in the primary laws of health 
and sanitation? Let one stupendous and shameful fact answer 
the question: There is expended in this country every year for 
worthless patent medicines more than three times as much 
money as is expended for public education. At what door should 
the responsibility of this not only useless but hurtful drain upon 
the people be laid, except at that of the public schools, the only 
agency that can reach and remove the cause? 
How goes it with our civil life, and what are our schools do- 
ing towards the making of good citizens? Practically all Ameri- 
can-born citizens have entered citizenship through the door of 
the public school. The citizenship of America today is ninety- 
nine-hundredths the handiwork of public education. Is it what 
it ought to be? If not, where lies the responsibility ? 
Do the highest civic ideals prevail everywhere? Do they pre- 
vail anywhere? Are our civic problems solved in a scientific 
way? Are our public officers always actuated by the highest 
motives, both in seeking the office and in the performance of its 
duties? Do our candidates for the various offices, as a rule, 
make appeals to the reason and civic righteousness of the voters, 
or to their prejudice? Do our people exercise the right of suf- 
frage in such a manner as to show that they have been trained 
to regard it as a sacred responsibility? Is it not a fact that 
organized selfishness is too easily getting a foothold in all sec- 
tions of our country? Is it not true at the present time that 
a large section of the South is being greatly inconvenienced by 
an unnecessary contest between labor and capital? 
These questions will-be answered as the local situation ap- 
pears to the hearer; but all will agree with me in the conten- 
tion that our civic conditions could be greatly improved through 
the well-directed efforts of our public schools, and that it is 
therefore the duty of these schools to take up the work. 
Is our home life all that could be desired? And if not, where 
is the fault? Have our homes been constructed to save as many 
useless steps as possible? Are they equipped with those labor- 
saving conveniences that reduce drudgery to a minimum, and
-P-A-G-E-53
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 538 
  thus emancipate the house-wife from a large part of that cease- 
less grind which has so long been the characteristic of much of 
the house work, especially on the farm? Are the sanitary laws 
properly observed in the home? Have not only the homes been 
made comfortable, convenient and healthful, but have we had a 
proper regard for the development of the esthetic natures of the 
children in them? Yet it is the products of our public schools 
that have built and now maintain these homes. Where, then, 
must the responsibility for the neglect of all these things be 
laid? 
How about our industrial life? Have we a varied industry? 
Do we work up our own raw materials, or are they consigned 
to other sections to perform the skilled labor and reap the larger 
profits? Have we a properly diversified agriculture? Do we 
use the most modern labor-saving machinery? Have we adopted 
the best scientific methods of tillage? Farm-life in the South 
under imaginable and easily realized conditions could be made 
happy, and prosperous, and rich, and full, and enjoyable, almost 
beyond imagination. What have the public schools done for 
rural life except to dissastisfy and send away from it in disgust 
the very young men and women best fitted by nature to make 
the most out of it? It is no slander, unless truth is slander, 
to say that the public school has done more than any other 
single agency, and perhaps more than all others combined, to 
banish from rural communities their very best heart, and brain, 
and brawn. 
How does it stand with regard to morals? It takes a sturdy 
honesty to withstand the temptation to juggle with the record 
here. This is not a question of opinion. It isa question of fact; 
and both in our court records and daily press the story is writ 
so large that he who runs may read. Notwithstanding half a 
century of public education, vice has never been so brazen and 
widespread, and crime so rampant as it is in America today. 
Take a single specification, the disergard for the sacredness of 
human life. There are in the United States per year more homi- 
cides per each hundred thousand of population than in any 
other nation in the world, civilized or uncivilized, so far as 
figures for the latter are obtainable. Nor can we hide behind 
the plea that this is due to influx or foreigners, for two reasons: 
First, the homicide rate in the United States is higher than it is  
-P-A-G-E-54
54 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  in any nation from which it draws its foreign populaton; and 
second, the rate is highest in this country in those sections 
where there is smallest percentage of foreign element. 
Let me throw out a suggestion here that you may follow out 
at your leisure. A great thinker has said, “Any system of edu- 
cation that creates wants, without at the same time providing 
the means for their satisfaction, educates for discontent and 
crime.” Now I submit, may it not be possible that public edu- 
cation confining itself, as it has done, almost exclusively to the 
intellectual stimulation of the masses, and thereby vastly en- 
larging the circle of their felt wants, is, through its failure to 
provide for the lawful gratification of these newly awakened 
desires, directly chargeable, in part at least, with this humiliat- 
ing and constantly increasing criminal record? 
And last, what is the spiritual outlook? It is the concensus 
of opinion of those who are giving a study to the question, as 
well as from the common observation of all who are working 
along the general lines of development of the people, that our 
churches are not having the influence that they should have. 
Many denominations report not only that churches are getting 
fewer, but that congregations are decreasing in size; it is espe- 
cially noticeable in the falling-off of men in attendance on 
church service. The natural soul-hunger for spiritual things is 
not being satisfied by a formal church service. The demand is 
that religion be a vital thing in the lives of the people. It is 
not creed nor dogma that the hearts of men yearn for, but a life 
of service—the doing of the word instead of hair-splitting theo- 
logical refinements. 
Now I have tried to be perfectly candid in my statements, 
and in the presentation of existing conditions. I realize, how- 
ever, that I shall be charged with pessimism.’ I am not a pes- 
simist. No man looks out upon human life and destiny with 
a larger hope than I do. I have an abiding faith in the power 
and providence of an Overruling Intelligence and Love that is 
working out through all things the completion of a divine plan. 
I believe in the mightiness of right, and in the final triumph of 
all good. On the other hand, however, I am just as firmly con- 
vinced that we ourselves are the agents through which God 
works towards the consummation of His will, and that the time 
of this consummation is largely determined by us. We cannot
-P-A-G-E-55
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 55 
of ourselves bring it about or prevent it, but we can hasten or 
hinder it. 
I know things are getting better in many definite ways; but 
I resent the fact that most of the influences which are at work 
for better living have emanated from other than educational 
sources. To us, because of the very nature of the work to which 
we have dedicated ourselves, belongs the task of leadership in 
the bringing about of all these better things. 
We come now to a vital and practical question. Why have 
public schools, so long and so carefully nurtured, so fondly and 
blindly trusted in, and maintained at so tremendous an ex- 
penditure of money, been so barren of desirable results? Why 
is it that today it is impossible to lay our finger upon any great 
contribution to the general good, and truthfully claim it as the 
gift of public education? 
To my mind there can be but one answer. The schools have 
been too busy in doing the sacred work of handing abstract 
knowledge down along the line of the changing generations, to 
give time and effort to supplying the demands for these real and 
larger human needs. Under the thralldom of tradition, and 
dominated by the ancient dogma of formal discipline, public 
education has been based upon the idea that the mystery of a 
time-honored school curriculum was its chief concern; that 
until this sacred duty was met, schools had no time for the vital 
concerns of real life; nor was there any need for looking out for 
these, for in some mysterious way the mastery of this curric- 
ulum was in itself a complete provision for life and living. 
The tenacity with which we have clung to this dogma of for- 
mal discipline has been the cause of more material loss, blighted 
opportunity, and spiritual death, than have all the other stum- 
bling blocks to be found in the path of human progress. It is 
the one parent ill of all our troubles. A fundamental principle 
of our educational philosophy, it has given form, direction and 
purpose to all our educational effort. Making us a race of self- 
sufficient pharisees, looking out for our own honor and glory, 
it has given us a total misconception of the real purpose of life, 
and the real meaning of living. 
This theory of education, placing it among the abstract rather 
than among the natural sciences, long prevented a careful study 
of the ends of education, its processes and its subject-matter. 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  56 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
It has caused us to go on from generation to generation in a 
beaten path, deluded by the idea that, through the exercise of 
the intellect in certain prescribed lines of thought, we would 
acquire an elusive something called culture, which was in itself, 
if not the highest good, a sure and sufficient means thereto. 
The result has been lamentable failure all along the line. Let 
me emphasize this point by a bit of. personal experience and 
observation. During my long tenure as Superintendent of the 
schools of my State, I often visited communities where public 
schools had been maintained annually for more than forty 
years; more often than otherwise, I found that the buildings 
in which the educational processes had been carried on during 
all these years were uncomfortable, unsanitary and ugly; that 
the yards and general surroundings were not kept with any re- 
gard to health or to beauty. I failed to see in the homes of the 
people that improvement which, it seems to me, one would ex- 
pect to find in homes for so long a time situated so near schools. 
To me it seemed as if the school had had a blighting effect on 
the industry of the community; the lands year by year were 
becoming poorer; the tools were the simplest and the farm 
processes the most primitive. I found it unfortunately true 
that the boys of initiative, those especially needed for leader- 
ship in their respective communities, left for the towns as soon 
as they could procure positions. 
I came to the conclusion that social standards and civic ideals 
and general social conduct did not show the improvement that 
ought to be necessary results of so many years of the influence 
of public schools. The same general conditions prevailed in the 
country churches. After several years of experience in the study 
of our common schools at first hand, I decided that there was 
something radically wrong with their work. I had always been 
told that schooling was a preparation for living; I failed to see 
how these schools had made for the better life in the neighbor- 
hoods in which they were located. 
I wish to be fair; I know that most of these schools were in 
session for short terms and were generally taught by most inef- 
ficient teachers. While this is true, one thing was very notice- 
able, and that was, that these schools had the same spirit, ideals 
and procedure as did the better ones. There was a difference 
in power, but not in purpose; in degree, but not in kind. Asa
-P-A-G-E-57
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 57 
result of these investigations, I came to the conclusion that the 
very conception of the function of the public schools was wrong. 
Their ideals did not comprehened definitely great life-ends. Al- 
most without exception, their purposes seemed to be to have all 
the children attempt to master a traditional curriculum, with- 
out reference to whether the subject-matter of this curriculum 
had any specific bearing upon their present or future lives. It 
seemed to be assured that if this time-honored course of study 
was mastered, in some mysterious, unexplainable way the vari- 
ous and diverse aptitudes of the children would assert them- 
selves, and, as a final result of the process, each would somehow 
find himself in perfect adjustment to his own peculiar life. In- 
stead of the course of study being arranged with reference to 
the needs of the child, the attempt has been all along to make 
the child fit the course of study; with the result that the large 
majority, unable to conform, gave up in disgust long before the 
completion of the ordeal. It is but voicing common observation 
to say, it is a question as to whether those who remained to com- 
plete the course were better prepared to meet the demands of 
real life, than those who gave up and quit. 
What is to be done? We have tried adding practical subjects 
to the time-honored studies, with the result, and the only result, 
that an impossible tax has been placed upon the physical and 
mental ability of the pupils, and that whatever semblance of 
coherency there was in the course of study has been destroyed. 
What we so much need is not merely the addition of social and 
industrial branches to the curriculum, but a radical reorganiza- 
tion of the whole school curriculum with reference to the future 
home, social, industrial and civic life of the pupils. 
For example, I would not have the children learn less arith- 
metic; but if the teaching of arithmetic were correlated with 
other work in the school, and more especially with the actual 
life of the community, who can doubt that in less time a far 
greater usable knowledge of the subject would be gained than 
when pursued as an isolated subject related to nothing on earth, 
in the heavens above, or in the waters beneath? The same ap- 
plies, and with equal force, to all the other branches of the 
traditional curriculum. The formal studies must not be all in 
themselves. They must be vitalized by being placed in a dyna- 
mic relationship to the great needs for which ‘schools exist. A

school-subject has value only in so far as it acts as a positive 
force in connection with other school-forces to prepare and 
equip the pupil to meet the demands of life in some phase, or 
in all its phases. 
In setting an end for public education, let us come down from 
the misty heights of abstract generalization to the level of the 
real and practical. We must aim at definite and concrete re- 
sults. 
Human institutions, as well as social, civil and industrial 
conditions, are always just what the people make them. In the 
people lie both the force that operates here, and the power that 
employes and directs it. This statement cannot be made too 
emphatic. It is both fundamental and universal. The people 
are the producing cause of both the form and content of their 
civilization and of the resulting conditions. These are but spe- 
cific forms in which the people express themselves. In this com- 
plex product the people are the only variable factors; all the 
rest are constant. To change the product, then, we must direct 
effort upon the variable. Man is the strategic point. All time, 
effort and resources employed in an attempt to develop institu- 
tions and conditions beyond the level of the social average, are 
worse than lost. From time undated, it has been the dream of 
man, it seems, to discover some short cuts on the Almighty. 
Instead of applying our minds to the finding out of God’s way, 
and then with patience and industry traveling His blazed path 
to the realization of our desires and needs, we have always en- 
deavored by some kind of legerdemain to accomplish these re- 
sults in some shorter and easier way. Just as the alchemist of 
old would by some magic touch turn baser metals into gold, so 
does man of today, by legislation and other artificial means, 
hope to bring about a transformation of all phases of our life 
as a people. 
In the public school we have the means of reaching the peo- 
ple, the producing cause of all life conditions. It is through the 
public schools, then, that we must work. The work of the pub- 
lic school then must be to condition the people in these various 
directions, so that, as water seeks its level, or as effect follows 
cause, the desired results will follow. 
This is not new doctrine. When Philip of Macedon placed 
his son Alexander under the instruction of Aristotle, the aged
-P-A-G-E-59
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 59 
philosopher asked the father what he most desired taught to 
his boy. “I want him,” said the king, “taught that in his youth 
which in his manhood he will most need to know.” We are but 
insisting upon Philip’s demand when we declare that we should 
put into the public schools what the future men and women 
will need to know,. as a means of doing what they should do, and 
of being what they should be. Our present and future needs 
must therefore determine the scope and purpose of public edu- 
cation. 
One of the most conspicuous causes of the failure of our peo- 
ple to receive a considerable culture, is that the home and the 
school do not require that the educational careers of the chil- 
dren be started on the necessary concrete basis; it is a lament- 
able fact that our children have not been brought into intelli- 
gent contact with their immediate surroundings; they have 
never been caused to explorg fully the miniature world, the 
boundaries of which mark the limits of their opportunity for 
contact with things and the causes and relations which are in- 
separably connected with their concrete surroundings. 
Any person’s grasp of the concrete world, which is acquired 
in early life, is a necessary limitation upon that person’s entire 
educational career and his possibility for culture. This is the 
only basis upon which a life rich in knowledge, culture and 
service can be built; yet, our children, at the time when nature 
is inviting and urging them to linger in this rich field to gar- 
ner a full storehouse of the necessary raw materials for a com- 
plete life, are ruthlessly forced to sacrifice these natural crav- 
ings of childhood, and to give themselves up completely to an 
effort to master meaningless signs and symbols—meaningless, 
because detached from the things they represent, and, as a re- 
sult, to flounder about on an uncertain sea during all their 
school days, and to be entangled in a maze of doubt and uncer- 
tainty during all their after lives. God has put no barriers be- 
tween the material and the cultural; these distinctions are man- 
made; the concrete is the necessary basis on which the good, 
the true, and the beautiful must be builded. (Applause.) 
Such a condition does not exist without a cause, and I am 
sure the reason is, the teachers have never made themselves the 
possessors of this most essential elementary knowledge. When 
they went to school they did not get this training, and they
-P-A-G-E-60
60 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
have found it hard to get away from their past selves. We all 
see what ought to be done, but find it hard to do the work. 
It is to be very much regretted that the best prepared teach- 
ers of the South have not studied and put into teachable shape 
this necessary educational matter; our topography, animal-life, 
plant-life, traditions, local history, civic life, industrial life and 
all other characteristics of the South are unexplored fields. 
What a rich and inviting opportunity! How such organized 
material is needed in the homes and in the schools! This work 
should not be longer neglected; the children are entitled to 
know the full alphabet with which they must spell out their 
destinies, and it is the duty of our schools to bring them into 
their rightful heritage. (Applause.) 
This does not mean that the text-books are to be excluded 
from the schools; but it does require that instead of their being 
studied without regard to their relation to each other and how 
they contribute to great life purposes, that they shall be prop- 
erly correlated with each other, and that all subjects together 
shall constitute an organic unity for the accomplishment of 
definite ends; and that they must be considered not merely as 
isolated, unrelated subject-matter. A careful study of our com- 
mon-school curriculum with this end in view will clearly show 
us that much of its subject-matter is obsolete and worthless, 
and that the placing of the part most needed in its proper re- 
lation in the chain of causation, will give it a new meaning and 
invest it with a new interest for the child, with the result that 
it will be better learned, and that, too, with less drudgery. It 
would also give us the opportunity to weave in much new mat- 
ter that is vital and necessary to the accomplishment of the 
great ends we have in view. 
Another thing, let me say to the advocates of the old order, 
that the intelligent study of the question of physical well-being, 
home-making, civic duties and industry, is but the necessary 
basis for the ability to acquire abstract knowledge and to rea- 
son abstractly. Our appreciation of literature and the fine arts 
must have a concrete basis. We are able to interpret these 
things in proportion as we have a mastery of the concrete ele- 
ments to which every form of art is referable. True art is but a 
beautiful expression of life. When we know concrete life well, 
we then have the power of appreciation of the finer meanings
-P-A-G-E-61
JOURNAL OF PROQEEDINGS. 61 
  of life as they are written in the language of the arts. (Ap- 
plause. ) 
I plead not merely for the theoretical learning of the organ- 
ized subject-matter that belongs to these various ends; this is 
essential, but not all. I plead not for a generation of people 
who can only talk about these essentials of a great civilization, 
but for men and women who have been both taught and prac- 
ticed in these great fundamentals until they are living embodi- 
ments of these eternal verities of life. I would account noth- 
ing learned until the student by practice had been transformed 
by, and conformed to, these great truths—both the Science and 
the Art. Let our schools be great lecture-rooms, where the 
fundamental principles of life are scientifically learned, and at 
the same time be laboratories for the practice of these princi- 
ples, until they become automatic habits in the lives of the men 
and women of the next generation. To know, to do, to be, con- 
stitute the logical steps in the realization of a well-ordered life. 
(Great applause.) 
We must turn our eyes from the little ones under our guid- 
ance to the future. We must see these little boys and girls, the 
objects of our solicitude, the men and women of the next genera- 
tion, performing all the functions of life as we believe these 
functions, measured by the standard of Christian civilization, 
should be performed. They must be complete men and women. 
What would we have them be? 
First, I would say they should be strong physically. Through 
the training in the proper knowledge of physical development, 
they should have strong bodies, free from all physical pains, and 
capable of enduring the strain of the strenuous times in which 
they live; a generation of men and women who have so con- 
sistently and uinformally lived in obedience to the laws of physi- 
cal well-being that these principles have become so incarnated 
in their very beings that without effort they live well physically. 
They should be in full coéperation with their fellows in all 
matters relating to general health. Through the observance of 
the laws, and the application of scientific methods of sanitation, 
the preventable diseases which for so long have meant physical 
weakness, industrial inefficiency and premature deaths, shall be 
practically driven from the land. 
The home should show the effects of the scientific inquiry
-P-A-G-E-62
62 SOUTHERN EDUOATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  which has been given it by men of thought, those especially 
trained to formulate the many and complex processes of work 
and living for the home. These boys and girls, when they are 
grown, must have comfortable, convenient, healthful and beauti- 
ful homes; they must have the best labor-saving devices, and 
must be skilled in their uses; they must have an appreciation 
of art and books as necessary factors in the making of a real 
home; in the various relations of members of the family, they 
must daily exemplify the best that has been evolved by the ages 
for family-life. In fine, the home to be built by these boys and 
girls, the men and women of a great tomorrow, must be so or- 
ganized and conducted that their examples and teachings will 
lay the foundations and give the impetus to the making of the 
greatest civilization that the world has ever known. 
Again this vision must include a picture of the little boys and 
girls performing the various functions of citizenship in the best 
organization of society the world has ever seen. They must not 
be in a continual scramble for the positions of honor and emolu- 
ment, but they must by force of habit respond honestly and in- 
telligently to every civic demand. They must not despise the 
every-day functions of citizenship; they must be good voters, 
honest and intelligent jurors, contributors to the making of the 
right kind of political opinion; and when they enter the public 
service, they must regard their functions as sacred trusts; and 
must know that it is not the holding of the position, but the 
manner of the discharge of the duties of the office, that gives 
honor. 
These little boys and girls, when grown, must take this South- 
land of ours, depleted by wasteful and unscientific methods, and 
transform its industrial life. Their very lives must be living 
refutations of the charge that highly skilled or artistic work 
cannot be done in the South. It is for them to show that God 
has committed as much of original power to them as He has to 
those of any part of the habitable globe; that they hold it as 
their high duty to have part and parcel in the great achieve- 
ments of the race; that they sin against heredity, opportunity, 
and the end of their existence, when they fail to do their full 
work. 
They must rescue the churches from Pharisees. It is for them 
to teach that religion means right living and service, and not
-P-A-G-E-63
JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 63 
  the reciting of creeds and the performing of ceremonies. They 
must be doers of the word and not the hearers only. They must 
show the world that religion should be vital in the lives of the 
people, not one, but seven days in each week. Through them, 
all men must be brought to know and serve God. 
My fellow-teachers, this is our work; to accomplish it re- 
quires industry, zeal, patience and faith. The keeping and mak- 
ing of the South is in our hands. We have voluntarily assumed 
this trust; we cannot escape the responsibility if we would; and 
only cowards would shift it if they could. Never has a more 
sacred duty been committed to human hands and human hearts 
than that which is given to us of taking the South, with her his- 
tory and traditions, her failures and achievements, her blood 
and possibilities, and making her what she should and could be. 
As to what the future in the South shall be will depend upon 
the response the teachers make to this great duty and oppor- 
tunity. (Long continued applause.) 
Tue Cuarr: One of the greatest educators of these United 
States is the speaker who will next address you. He has done 
things as Superintendent of Instruction in the great city of 
Cleveland, Ohio, and these things which he has done we will do 
later. 
It gives me great pleasure to introduce to you Dr. W. H. 
Elson, Superintendent of Schools of Cleveland, Ohio. (Ap- 
plause.) His theme will be, 
“FACTS VERSUS OPINIONS IN EFFICIENT SCHOOL 
ADMINISTRATION.” 
W. H. ELSON, CLEVELAND, OHIO. 
I—SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT IN SCHOOL ADMINSITRATION, 
We hear a good deal these days about “scientific manage- 
ment.” Scientific management as employed in current maga- 
zines has to do with business. In the field of affairs, where ef- 
ficiency and economy were supposed to exist, need has been 
found for radical revision of methods. Elaborate studies are 
being made, both upon the material and the human side, with 
reference to economy in doing given kinds of work. New means 
are being devised to inspire in the workman a proper attitude
-P-A-G-E-64
64 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  toward his work, and a personal motive for doing it well. New 
conceptions are arising with regard to the adaptability of men 
for given tasks, and men are being selected with reference to 
their natural ability to do particular things. In a word, serious 
study of what is involved in a given product, of how to inspire 
workmen to do their best, and of how to select men for a given 
task, is bringing about a revolution in the business world. 
There is, to be sure, a difference between the school and its 
product, and business and its output. This difference, however, 
has been more or less exaggerated. Indeed, school administra- 
tors and teachers, as a rule, have a tendency to resent the im- 
plication that there is any analogy between business manage- 
ment and school management, that their work can be subject 
to definite checks and measured by fixed standards of efficiency. 
While the manager of a business establishment has been and is 
subjected to definite tests as measured on the one hand by out- 
put, and on the other by profits, the Superintendent in the ad- 
ministration of the school has been relatively free from all 
definite checks, whether on the side of business management, 
or on the side of educational work. To no inconsiderable de- 
gree school administrators have been free from those criteria 
and standards by which men in other activities have long since 
been judged. 
Again, workmen, in quite every line, are subjected to definite 
measures of efficiency. This is true, whether in handling pig 
iron, or in the production of articles involving skill, intelligence 
and taste. Every move of a baseball player, for example, is 
checked, and at the end of the season he may have a definite 
picture of his efficiency as measured by standards current in the 
baseball world. The teacher, like the administrator, however, 
has been inclined to resent the thought that her efficiency can 
be measured by any of the criteria or checks of business or by 
any definite standards. Though the teacher attempts to meas- 
ure the efficiency of the child, she demurs at the idea that her 
efficiency may at least be relatively determined by facts concern- 
ing her school—as by the regularity of attendance of her pu- 
pils; by the amount of absence; by the number of withdraws; 
by the number of failures in studies, and by the number of non- 
promotions. 
In a word, both teachers and administrators of schools have,
-P-A-G-E-65
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 65 
to a large degree, held themselves aloof from any definite tests, 
and from any definite measure of efficiency. The day is, how- 
ever, at hand when school administrators and teachers must 
come to appreciate that we are not a chosen class of workers, 
but that our work, like the work of all others, must be judged in 
view of relatively definite standards. We must come to appre- 
ciate that the spirit of scientific management as now applied to 
business must be brought over into the work of education, to do 
for the school what it is now doing for business. We have as 
yet only made a beginning. 
  II—PRESENT PLACE OF OPINION IN SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION. 
Not only have school administrators and teachers been more 
or less free from the exacting tests of other activities, but we 
have been guided in our work to no slight extent by opinion, 
rather than by facts. Perhaps in no other field does personal 
opinion play so prominent a part. The business of the school 
is carried on this way today because this was. the practice yes- 
terday; the school-year is of a given length because this was 
its length a decade ago; the same methods of promotion are 
continued because these were the methods of the past; our at- 
titude toward foreign languages, toward science, toward for- 
mal grammar, toward the time and place given to arithmetic; 
our ideas of where to begin the teaching of formal spelling, or 
of writing, or of geography; of how much to require in a given 
grade—these rest not wpon facts, but very largely upon opin- 
ions, opinions which in turn are determined to a considerable 
extent by education and temperament. 
Let us take reading as an example: Do the pupils in your 
school read well? Is their growth in the mastery of literature 
in grades between the fourth and the eighth satisfactory? Is it 
commensurate with the large share of time assigned to this 
study? Have pupils in these grades an organized knowledge 
of what they have read, and have they made familiar friends 
of our leading writers of prose and poetry, especially our Ameri- 
can authors? Have they learned to love good literature and to 
choose it outside the school? Have they learned to appreciate 
the beautiful way in which an author finds fine resemblances 
between things in most respects unlike, and with this simple 
method—the method of comparison—uses his vast fund of 
5
-P-A-G-E-66
66 SOUTHERN’ EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  knowledge and learning for our interest and pleasure? Whether 
or not you answer these questions in the affirmative is largely 
a matter of opinion, opinion unsupported by tangible data or 
criteria for measuring results. 
Not only in the work of administration are our larger policies 
a reflection to a greater or lesser extent of personal bias, but 
even in smaller matters—if they may be so called—the personal 
point of view dominates to a considerable extent. We arbi- 
trarily assume that our children profit by this or that study; 
we arbitrarily assume that the elementary school and the high 
school are doing all they should for their pupils; we arbitrarily 
assume that this style and type of writing are preferable; that 
our children are good or poor in spelling; that the work in his- 
tory and geography is effective; we arbitrarily assume that the 
proper emphasis is placed upon each of the studies, and these 
given their proper time value, and their proper emphasis in the 
advancement of children through the school. Seldom, indeed, 
in the past have we proved by systematic investgation any of 
the above assumptions. To illustrate: In view of the fact that 
children differ in natural capacity and interest, in opportunity 
and outlook, in destination and in the length of time they may 
remain in school, can a single course high school, offering only 
college preparatory courses, do for the community all that a 
high school should do? In view of these wide differences among 
children, must not a high school that would serve the whole peo- 
ple and be truly democratic, offer a variety of courses suited to 
these various needs? Further, in view of the fact that of the 
thirty-two million bread-winners in the United States, less than 
two million are in professional and official life, and more than 
thirty million earn their living in some form of work in the 
field of industry and commerce, is it not the part of wisdom that 
we should recognize this great fact and provide a variety of 
schools or courses suited to the needs of all the people in the 
community? When such provision is made, what effect has it 
upon high school attendance? In Cleveland, prior to 1908, the 
city offered but one type of high school instruction; that is, the 
usual academic cr literary course, requiring four years of for- 
eign language. it had six high schools of this type, and for 
three years previous to 1908 these schools were at a standstill 
in the matter of enrollment, notwithstanding the fact that the
-P-A-G-E-67
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 67 
  city was growing at the rate of over 2,000 school children each 
year, the total growth in school census for the three years being 
7,000. In 1908 the city opened a technical high school and the 
following year a high school of commerce. Immediately the 
high school enrollment jumped from 4,900 to 5,500, and the fol- 
lowing year to 6,400, and the next year to 7,300. In other 
words, the high school population for the three years preceding 
the opening of vocational high schools remained stationary, 
while the following three years it made a gain of 50 per cent. 
In other words, a new class of high school students was ap- 
pealed to, and within three years more than 2,000 of these chil- 
dren had enrolled in these new types of high school. Most sig- 
nificant of all, however, is the fact that the older type of high 
school, namely, the academic high schools themselves, shared in 
the prosperity. While at first the academic high schools suffered 
a slight loss by transfer of some pupils to the new types of 
school, yet within three years this loss has not only been re- 
covered, but these schools themselves have reached their highest 
point of enrollment, which is about 400 pupils in advance of 
their highest previous enrollment. To state the case in other 
words would be to say that so-called vocational high schools 
create interest and growth in all types of high schools, and this 
is just what has happened in Germany, where industrial educa- 
tion has multiplied enormously in the last fifteen years, during 
which period the literary universities of Germany have doubled 
their enrollment. If education, therefore, is to serve all the peo- 
ple, it must offer advantages and opportunities to students hav- 
ing different interests and different outlook and destination, and 
when a city offers such variety of opportunity it will be re- 
warded by a response that is truly encouraging. By actual test 
in Cleveland it is proved that enlarged opportunity brings in- 
creased enrollment in the high school. Schools of agriculture 
prove the same truth. 
If, however, the public school is to be scientifically managed ; 
if schoo] administration is to be elevated above the plane of 
mere personal opinion; if the work of the Superintendent, as 
well as that of the teacher, is to be measured by definite cri- 
teria; if our theories are to be given foundation; if our assump- 
tions with reference to lines of work, methods of instruction, 
mastery of subject-matter and skill in manipulation, are to be
-P-A-G-E-68
68 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  displaced by positive knowledge, scientific and systematic study 
must be made of school methods and of school results; for only 
as facts take the place of opinion, assumption gives way to defi- 
nite knowledge, mere personal opinion yields to established 
principles, will the administration of schools be placed upon a 
firm footing and become efficient. 
III—FACTS VERSUS OPINION IN MBASURING BFFICIENCY. 
An illustration or two will make clear to you the mode of 
procedure, as I take it, which must be pursued, at least in spirit, 
if the management of our schools is to become scientific. 
The present-day school differs from that or two or three gen- 
erations ago. Its purposes and aims have changed. Old studies 
have received new content, new studies have been added, and 
new methods of instruction employed. The reason for the dif- 
ferences between the school of the present and of the past not 
being readily understood, the present-day school comes in for 
criticism. It is affirmed that children do not read as well, spell 
as well, or write as well as in the past, and that they have not 
the same skill in arithmetic as formerly. Such criticism is, of 
course, the eternal protest of the old against the new. Yet 
school men are so accustomed to take things for granted, so lit- 
tle inclined to investigate, and to check results, that they have 
gone on year after year denying these protests and affirming 
that present-day instruction is better than the instruction of 
the past. The unsupported assertions of school men with re- 
gard to the efficiency of teaching will, however, no longer suf- 
fice. Public criticism must be met by facts. 
The spelling, for example, of children graduating from the 
elementary schools of Cleveland was criticised for years by busi- 
ness men. That data might be obtained either to affirm or re- 
fute this criticism, there was given to all eight-grade pupils of 
the Cleveland public schools, May 17, 1909, the spelling exami- 
nation which was set the corresponding grade of pupils, July, 
1858—fifty years ago. The test consisted of twenty words. The 
children of 1909 were at a disadvantage in taking this exami- 
nation, for the words employed were selected from the spelling 
work of the year and were for this reason familiar to the chil- 
dren of 1858. Notwithstanding this, the children of 1858 mis-
-P-A-G-E-69
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 69 
  spelled on the average practically one more word per pupil than 
those of 1909, giving the children of 1909 a better average ef- 
ficiency mark by 4.54 per cent, which represents an average gain 
in efficiency of 6.12 per cent. In a word, judged upon the basis 
of this test, the children of 1909 were better spellers than the 
children of 1858, the “golden age of spelling,” As a result of 
this and other like tests criticism was silenced, and the superi- 
ority of the present-day school as to the teaching of spelling was 
accepted by all. 
Similar critcism was made with regard to efficiency in arith- 
metic. That data might be had with reference to the effective- 
ness of the work in arithmetic, there was given, May 28, 1909, 
to all eighth-grade pupils of our schools, the same examination 
in arithmetic as was given July, 1856. This examination of 
1856 was a difficult one for the children of the present. Not only 
were the problems of a different character from those now used, 
but three of them came under parts of arithmetic which we no 
longer teach, and could only be solved by our children through 
the independent application of general power. This was done 
in a few cases. 
Despite this heavy handicap, it will be observed that the chil- 
dren of 1856 made on the average two or more errors than those 
of 1909, and that the latter made a better average grade in ef- 
ficiency than the former by 11.42 per cent. 
In other words, the children of 1909 showed an average im- 
provement in efficiency in arithmetic over those of 1856 of 23.69 
per cent. This improvement was made moreover in face of the 
fact that in 1856, 20.58 per cent of the total time of the school 
was devoted to arithmetic, against 16.40 per cent in 1909. Evi- 
dence that less time may be given to arithmetic without loss of 
efficency when it is correlated with geography, history, drawing, 
manual training and household arts; that is, when it is applied 
to practical activities and constructions. 
Such tests have, of course, their limitations. Still, only as 
data is collected and presented which is a reasonable measure 
of efficiency, can public criticism be met, will school administra- 
tors have a firm basis of judging the work of the school, and the 
public be convinced that the school is increasingly effective in 
the imparting of knowledge.

IV—FACTS VERSUS OPINION IN FIXING STUDY GRADES AND STUDY 
VALUES. 
  One of the most important problems in connection with edu- 
cation is to determine in what grades of the elementary school 
and years of the high school given studies shall be taught, and 
to fix upon the time value of these studies in particular grades 
and years, for the emphasis placed upon a school study is fixed 
by the time devoted to it. Thus far, tradition and personal opin- 
ion have been large factors in determining in what grades a 
study appears, and the amount of time to be devoted to it. 
That local tradition might to some extent be eliminated from 
our course of study, and that the personal bias of supervisors 
might be overcome, data was collected from fifty of the largest 
cities of the United States with reference to the branches find- 
ing place in the elementary school and with reference to the 
grades in which they were taught. These data were tabulated 
and became the basis of fixing the grades in which the various 
elementary school subjects are now taught in the Cleveland 
public schools. 
Similarly, in determining time values, the time-schedules of 
ten of the most important cities in the country were taken, and 
from these a time-schedule made, representing the average time 
given in these cities to each of the studies in the different grades. 
This average time-schedule was then made the basis of deter- 
mining the time-schedule of the Cleveland schools. 
To be sure, such data with regard to study-grades and study- 
values are by no means conclusive, for the problems involved 
can only be solved through careful investigation and study. 
Nevertheless, such data serve as a reasonable basis for the elimi- 
nation of personal bias and opinion from the course of study 
and the time schedule. 
V—FACTS VERSUS OPINION IN DETERMINING METHODS AND STAND- 
ARDS OF PROMOTION. 
Doubtless no one factor penetrates so deeply into the life of 
the school as methods of promotion, for this involves standards 
of attainment and modes of advancing children from grade to 
grade, as well as from school to school. To a very considerable 
extent plans of promotion have been determined in view of the
-P-A-G-E-71
  JOURNAL OF PROOBEDINGS. TW 
easy organization and administration of the school, and in view 
of the pleasure of the teacher. Whether the plan conserved the 
best interests of the child and permitted him without undue 
hindrance to advance through the school on time, has been little 
considered. 
The time is, however, at hand when standards of attainment 
must be re-determined, for as yet we are almost ignorant of 
what constitutes a just measure of the efficiency of children, 
even in such formal studies as spelling or arithmetic or writing. 
What speed, for example, apart from clarity, should be the re- 
quirement in writing? What is a reasonable degree of accuracy 
to insist upon in arithmetic? What is a reasonable number of 
errors in spelling? Our answers to these questions thus far rest 
upon tradition and opinion, rather than upon scientific investiga- 
tion. Furthermore, thetimeis at hand when modes of promotion 
must be viewed with regard to effect upon educational waste. 
That is, with regard to its effect upon withdrawal from school 
and upon the amount of repetition, and a promotion plan de- 
vised which will enable children as a rule to complete the ele- 
mentary school course on the average in eight years, and the 
high school course in four. Such a plan must be so flexible that 
each child shall be permitted to advance through the school 
according to his ability. It must permit the bright child to 
advance in less than the average required time, and even though 
the slow child may take longer, the average, when all the chil- 
dren passing through the school are taken into account, should 
not be more than eight years for the elementary and four years 
for the high school. 
Such a method of promotion can evidently not be determined 
theoretically, nor can personal opinion be a determining factor. 
Such a method of promotion can only be devised, and can only 
be administered in view of a large body of facts with regard 
to actual school conditions; with regard to failures in studies, 
withdrawals, retardations and non-promotions in a_ given 
system. 
It was found, for example, in the case of Cleveland that for 
a ten-year period but 48.23 per cent of all the children enrolled 
in the first grade reached the sixth grade, but 36.29 per cent 
reached the seventh, and that but one pupil in four attained the 
eighth grade. In a word, taking the records for ten years as  
-P-A-G-E-72
72 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  a basis of judgment, it was found that only one child in two 
ever advanced in our elementary school beyond the fifth grade. 
It was found that in the year 1909-10, exclusive of all special 
schools, 25.35 per cent of our elementary pupils were retarded 
from one to four years; that is, in a total enrollment of 61,668, 
9,278 children were behind their grade one year, 3,975 two 
years, 1,493 three years, and 891 four and more years. 
It was further found that for the year 1909-10 each tenth 
child was a repeater; that is, every tenth dollar spent on the 
elementary school during 1909-10 was expended in taking chil- 
dren over the same work a second time. Or to put it in terms 
of dollars, we were spending in our city over two hundred thou- 
sand dollars annually for re-teaching children. 
It was also found that at the close of the school year 1909-10, 
10.94 per cent of all elementary pupils, exclusive of those in 
special schools, had failed of promotion, and were thereby des- 
tined to repeat an entire year of school work. 
These facts with reference to withdrawls, retardation, repeti- 
tion and non-promotion, were brought to bear in determining 
a new promotion plan and in re-determining the length of the 
school year. To reduce the possible amount of repetition, the 
annual plan of promotion was abandoned and a term plan inau- 
gurated. A term of twelve weeks was made the unit, both in 
elementary and high schools. At the end of this period chil- 
dren are re-classified, and in case of non-promotion the pupil 
at most has to repeat at any one time but twelve weeks of work. 
Proceeding on the theory that there were as many pupils in 
the school who could do more than the average amount of work 
required, as there were pupils who could do less, opportunity 
was provided for the more rapid advancement of bright pupils, 
to the end that the amount of repetition and retardation might 
be reduced. Since the non-promotions for a two-year period 
amounted to approximately ten per cent of the enrollment, pro- 
vision was made that ten per cent of the pupils of any given 
room might be given double promotion—that is, jumped over a 
term’s work, provided, however, that no pupil might be given 
a double promotion unless his average for the term in all studies 
was 90 per cent or above, and that no pupil should be given 
more than one double promotion in a single school year. Though 
double promotion of a given number of pupils will, by no means,
-P-A-G-E-73
JOURNAL OF PROOCHEDINGS. 13 
eradicate repetition and retardation, yet in time the number of 
children repeating will be equalled by the number given double 
promotion, and the number of children behind their grade for 
their age will be offset or balanced by the per cent of pupils 
ahead of their grade. Our school system thus becomes its own 
clearing house, is made to check itself, and certain of the bad 
effects of repetition and retradation are neutralized. 
That it might be possible for the present large number of re- 
tarded children to advance further in the course of the elemen- 
tary school, the regular school year was divided into three terms 
of twelve weeks each and a twelve-week summer school, offering 
regular work and giving regular credits. 
The twelve-week summer term makes a unit of work which 
correlates with the unit of work of the regular school year. Re- 
tarded children, by taking advantage of the summer term, are 
thus enabled to reduce the degree of their retardation and ad- 
vance further in the course than formerly. Three high schools 
are opened for regular work for a twelve-week summer term, 
one being a technical high school, a high school of commerce, 
and an academic high school, to which pupils from any high 
school district in the city are eligible. Students taking advan- 
tage of this summer quarter complete a four-year high school 
course in three years. 
Whether the thirty-six week school year and a twelve-week 
summer term, and whether this mode of promotion will prove 
successful, experience alone can tell. At all events, this plan 
for the school year, and this plan of promotion are illustrations 
of how definite knowledge of school conditions may be used in 
attempting to meet actual problems in administration. 
VI—FACTS VERSUS OPINION IN STANDARDIZING SUBJECTS, DEPART- 
MENTS AND SCHOOLS. 
Notwithstanding the value of studies is fixed by the time al- 
lotted in the daily program, study requirements in practice 
seemingly have little relation to the value ascribed. Reading, 
for example, is given in the present time schedule 24.77 per cent 
of the total time of the Cleveland elementary schools; language 
and grammar, 12.33 per cent; arithmetic, 15.45 per cent; and 
history, 4.22 per cent; while in the first year of the high school 
Latin, English, algebra and natural history are ascribed like 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  T4 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  value. Nevertheless, the failures in language and grammar in 
the fall term of this year were, in view of the time value, almost 
four times as many as in reading, those in arithmetic five times 
larger, while those in history were six times greater; whereas 
in high school in the year 1909-10, 26 per cent of the children 
dropped out or failed in Latin, 15.9 per cent in English, 13.4 
per cent in algebra and 22. per cent in natural history. Such 
variations reveal a need for standardization in studies as well 
as in departments. Standards for completing a study of great 
value should be such as to actually put the emphasis on that 
study, rather than that pressure on one study when measured 
by the time allotted should be two to twenty times as great as 
upon another. Yet, until positive data is collected with refer- 
ence to failures in studies in the various grades, and these data 
made the basis of administrative action, little can be accom- 
plished in equalizing and standardizing study requirements. 
There is a similar need with regard to standardizing individ- 
ual schools, for there is a wide variation in the standards of the 
several schools in the same system. For example, in our system 
for the fall term the failures in reading on total enrollment 
ranged from 0 to 25 per cent, in language and grammar from 
0 to 34 per cent, in arithmetic from 0 to 37 per cent, while the 
per cent of non-promotions for individual schools ranged from 
0 to 47 per cent in the first grade, in the second from 0 to 38 per 
cent, and in the eighth from 0 to 55 per cent. Such variations 
in standards in a single system can scarcely be countenanced. 
That schools should be rightly judged with regard to their work, 
and that there should be reasonable uniformity of requirements 
in different schools, there can be little doubt. Yet, before this 
can be done, data must be collected with reference to failures 
in studies, and non-promotions in different schools; and upon 
the basis of these, city-wide standards fixed, and the require- 
ments of individual schools equalized and their work judged. 
But it is sometimes argued that attempts to measure ef- 
ficiency and to standardize results interfere with the develop- 
ment of that beautiful spirit which is at once the essence and 
glory of the public school. Obviously, this theory is without 
foundation, for the best teacher has the best attendance. Her 
pupils love the school. She has few withdrawals, because her 
pupils are interested and she does not permit them to become
-P-A-G-E-75
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 15 
discouraged. She has few non-promotions, because her teach- 
ing has been clear and strong. Is such a teacher less efficient 
and less powerful in her influence on pupils because the measure 
of her efficency has been taken and there is positive data show- 
ing that she is an efficient teacher? 
By a series of tests it was shown that the most efficient 
schools in Cleveland were not those suppose to be the most ef- 
ficient. 
For him who has no actual knowledge of school conditions 
there are no problems to be solved. Life is one beautiful dream. 
But to him who knows that those who fall by the wayside on the 
highway of elementary and high school are vastly more numer- 
ous than those who represent the “survival of the fittest”—for 
him there are innumerable and pressing problems to solve. 
CONCLUSION. 
The foregoing will suffice to illustrate how facts may be gath- 
ered and employed in the management of the school. In the 
collection and use of such data, a mere beginning has been made. 
Yet, if the spirit of scientific management is to pervade educa- 
tion ; if the effectiveness of the school as an institution is to be 
definitely measured ; if the work of the teacher, as well as that 
of the administrator, is to be subjected to fixed tests; if personal 
bias and mere unsubstantiated opinion are to give way to posi- 
tive knowledge, and school administration rendered effective, 
data similar to the above with reference to all administrative 
problems must be collected and employed in directing educa- 
tional activities, to the end that the modern school may be made 
to serve all the children and all the people of the community.

Professor Horn distributed telegrams and mail which had 
been received for various members and announced the details 
as to the afternoon departmental meetings. He stated that be- 
cause of the continued cold and lack of heating facilities in the 
City Auditorium, the evening meeting would be held in the 
First Methodist Church, and at 7:30 o’clock. He also called at- 
tention to the exhibits to be seen in the High School building, 
and urged all to examine them as well as to attend the depart- 
mental meetings.

Tup Cuair: As President of the Southern Educational As- 
sociation, I want to urge everyone to become a member. It is 
important that you should do so, because your influence, as 
well as the small sum you will pay to become a member, will 
redound greatly to the advance of education in the South. The 
spirit of education is more pronounced now than ever before in 
this beloved section of our country, and we want it to grow in 
strength until there is not left in the whole Southland a single 
child who shall not have the opportunity for an education. 
You are the ones to accomplish this. You are the leaders of 
educational thought and action in this great section of the Na- 
tion. Upon you depends the outcome, whether the general aver- | 
age of intelligence shall be raised and the stain of illiteracy re- 
moved from our beloved country, or whether it shall remain. 
So I hope that every person who is here tonight, is either al- 
ready enrolled as a member of this association, or will become 
a member of it before this meeting closes. 
As President of this Association, I am going to exercise a 
privilege tonight which I am sure you will readily accord me. 
This is the time-honored occasion for presentation of the Presi- 
dent’s Annual Address, but we have a long program and I am 
going to forego the pleasure of delivering that address, and 
turn it over to the Secretary to be incorporated with the Pro- 
ceedings. If any of you are very anxious to read this address, 
I will say that it will appear in the Houston Chronicle to- 
morrow.

PRESIDENT’S ANNUAL ADDRESS. 
SOME DEMANDS OF TWENTIETH CENTURY UPON EDUCATION. 
M. A. CASSIDY. 
The Twentieth Century will demand from public education 
a higher citizenship for State and Nation. The molding of the 
masses into good citizens is the only excuse for education at 
public expense. Enormous sums of money are expended upon 
public education, not from a motive of charity, but because the 
State hopes thereby to promote civilization and to perpetuate 
free institutions. If it may be called charity, it is an apt ex- 
ample of charity beginning at home; for an intelligent citizen- 
ship is the only security that free institutions shall not perish 
from the earth. Indeed, popular education is the price of popu- 
lar institutions. The citizen who pays a school tax should 
neither be stirred by charitable emotions nor disturbed by feel- 
ings of displeasure. He is neither giving nor being robbed; he 
is simply discharging a just obligation to posterity. He is only 
handing over to the State, an aggregation of individuals, its 
scientific, literary, vsthetic, institutional and spiritual inheri- 
tance, which, for a generation, he has held as trustee. Not only 
must the State, through its children, have the whole heritage, 
but, also, the interest of progress. If the schools do not steadily 
contribute to civic righteousness, they do not perform their 
chief function, and, therefore, public education is a failure. No 
one will deny that there has been marked improvement in the 
intelligence of our citizenship; but can as much be said for its 
civic righteousness? A few years ago “graft” would have been 
considered as dishonorable as theft. Now, it is generally con- 
sidered one of the perquisites of office. A large majority of 
those who practice it have been taught, I dare not say educated, 
in the common schools. Three generations ago dishonest elec- 
tions were almost unknown. It was a crime then, as now, to 
buy or sell votes; but then, as not now, an honest and a patri- 
otic public sentiment actually prevented its accomplishment. 
When I was a boy down in Tennessee, a candidate for Con- 
gress influenced a voter by giving him, a month before the elec- 
tion, a grist of corn. This became known throughout the dis- 
trict, and the candidate received only one vote. In low political
-P-A-G-E-79
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 79 
  parlance, the subsidized elector evidently “delivered the goods.”’ 
The opinion in those days was that any one who would pur- 
chase a vote could be bought—not, perhaps, in the same way 
or at the same price, but in a more important capacity and for 
a larger sum. This is doubtless truer now than it was then; 
for there are now more demands for the corruption of officials 
than then. The formation of the trust, which sets aside an an- 
nual corruption fund with as few conscientious scruples as it 
calculates its legitimate running expenses, gave a great impetus 
to official corruption. The civic conscience has been so seared 
with burning greed that corruption is considered a necessary 
part of politics. Only a few years ago I heard a politician, of 
more than local prominence, say, in a speech to an audience of 
ward workers: “Boys, you must win tomorrow’s election; 
honestly, if you can, but win.” The speaker and, with perhaps 
a dozen exceptions, his entire audience, had been taught in the 
public schools. Indeed, the most serious indictment that can 
be brought against the common schools is that, in the cities, 
where great sums are spent in their maintenance, and where 
the palatial buildings, trained teachers, modern equipment and 
perfected systems are the boast of the municipality, there is 
more civic corruption than in the rural communities, where 
few of these ideal educational conditions exist. The tempta- 
tions and opportunities, it is true, are greater in the cities; but, 
if our public schools are to subserve the purpose of, their 
maintenance, so are the means of training the civic conscience. 
Any kind of fraud against the ballot is a blow at the vitals of 
free government; yet’ it is planned in high places, and these 
plans are executed by the masses who have been taught in our 
public schools. Those of the latter who can devise the smooth- 
est schemes for their execution are applauded and rewarded. 
And, since many of our judiciary are elected in this way, they 
wink at fraud and turn a deaf ear to the defrauded. These 
nefarious shemes for corrupting the ballot and thwarting the 
will of the people are devised and executed by those who have 
attended the public schools. Even men who have aspired to the 
leadership of the educational forces, have been found in the 
counsels of the schemers and have profited by the theft of the 
ballot.
-P-A-G-E-80
80 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  All are familiar with the numerous phases which civic un- 
righteousness has assumed. Their name is legion. They are 
the devils with which our country is possessed. Greed is the 
father of them all. Many reformers, brave and devoted men 
and women, have attempted to cast them out 3 but, at most, 
they have only silenced them for a time. The devils will re- 
main in the body politic as long as they are in the individuals 
who compose it. The public schools are the only miracle work- 
ers that can cast them out. The twentieth century will demand 
that they do it. It will demand that teachers shall not only 
know the history and value of our politcal institutions, but that 
they are likewise familair with the dangers with which they are 
menaced. There is a lamentable ignorance in the teaching 
profession, I mean in the common schools where the masses 
are taught, concerning these things. Think of the public school 
teachers of your acquaintance, and you will be surprised how 
few of them have a historical and patriotic appreciation of our 
governmental institutions and know the civic vices which 
threaten them. 
It is character which counts in citizenship. The chief aim of 
education should be character; this is the great hope of society. 
The worth and strength of a State depend far less upon the 
form of its institutions than upon the character of its men. 
Civilization itself is only a question of personal improvement. 
Not until character is the great and steady aim of the public 
school teacher, will civic unrighteousness begin to disappear. 
“One former,” as a great man has truly said, “is worth a thou- 
‘sand reformers.” 
The public school is the loom in which our nation’s destiny 
must be woven. The woof and warp of this wondrous fabric 
must be character. Only in this way can the national con- 
science be restored. The State, like the individual, is dual. It 
has an ideal and real self. As in the individual, so in State, is 
conscience the criticism which the ideal self passes on the real 
self. It is only by heeding this voiceless criticism that either 
the individual or the State becomes nobler. The home and the 
school must implant and cultivate this conscience. Thus on'y 
will right become the politcal religion of the nation. The twen- 
tieth century will demand of its schools:
-P-A-G-E-81
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 81 
“Strong minds, great hearts, true faith and ready hands, 
Men whom the lust of office does not kill; 
Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy; 
Men who possess opinions and a will; 
Men who have honor, men who will not lie; 
Men who can stand before a demagogue, 
And damn his treachers flatteries without winking! 
Tall men, sun-crowned, who live above the fog 
In public duty and in primitive thinking.” 
In a government like ours any education is a failure that 
does not relate itself to citizenship and life. The political se- 
curity and the economic power of this republic rest upon the 
moral sense and the common disposition to produce. Honor 
and usefulness do not depend alone upon intellectual pursuits. 
The twentieth century will demand that the schools will aid 
in all of the industries; and will give as much honor to manual 
skill as to intellectual occupations. The man who can put a 
good roof on a house is a necessary as the one who makes good 
laws. In fact, it is more comfortable to live under a bad law 
than under a leaky roof. Even now preaching is considered 
more honorable than blacksmithing. One is as honorable as the 
other if the products are equally good. But every one must ad- 
mit that it is better to pound an anvil than a pulpit, and that 
a good horseshoe is better than a poor sermon. Well cooked 
food is an aid to right living, but trashy fiction, the production 
of which is the occupation and living of a great host of men 
and women, poisons the minds of the young and lowers the so- 
cial standard. The mechanic who designs and constructs a com- 
fortable, hygenic home, is even more valuable to society that the 
physician; for prevention is better than physic. One would 
think that carpentering would be honored above all professions 
or trades, since the lowly Nazarene, in whose honor millions of 
monumental churches have been upreared, wore a leathern 
apron and worked at the bench. In keeping our eyes fixed too 
intently on the halo with which art has surrounded His head, 
we lose sight of his toil-marked hands, and so we find it easier 
to honor a carpenter who lived 2,000 years ago than to respect 
one who lives today. In this we do not differ from the gentry 
of that far-off time. But we must realize that, inasmuch as we 
honor labor, do we glorify Jesus. His hands were as worthy 
of a balo as his head; both were glorious. While his brain 
6

82 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  conceived a matchless code of ethics, which throb with the 
rhythmical beats of love, his hands dignified and ennobled 
labor. 
Since there are but three possible modes of living, mendi- 
eancy, theft and labor, public education must train for effective 
service. Life is service, and education is for life. Any educa- 
tion that fails to give this sort of training promotes, in some 
degree, either mendicancy or crime. Therefore the schools must 
produce active men and women. Thought-power is good, but 
this without the power of concrete expression, is educational 
paralysis. The uneducated loafer is just as valuable to society 
as one who is educated. An education that sheds light upon 
darkness is valuable to society only in proportion as it gener- 
ates heat. Clearness of intellectual vision alone does not make 
man efficient. Each group of ideas must find its adequate mo- 
tor expression. 
The twentieth century will demand a model rural school 
within reach of every child, and a high school in every county. 
All of these schools will be related to all that is best in rural 
life.. An intelligent study of nature will make the country boy 
and girl satisfied with their environment. Not one in a thou- 
sand of the rural schools, outside of Illinois, and in a measure 
two other States, do anything to relate learning to the life of 
the pupils. Consequently, all farm industry is monotonous 
drudgery for the young, when it should be delightfully fasci- 
nating. The brain and the hand, in rural occupations, have 
been too long separated. The country children must be taught 
to know and appreciate nature by studying it at first hand. 
They only need the opportunity and wise direction to fathom 
her secrets and make practical use of them. In this way IIli- 
nois is revolutionizing her farming interests. School life is 
here so intimately related to farm life, that the interest in both 
has been greatly enhanced.. Books are studied with more zest 
than ever before, because the ideas acquired may be given mo- 
tor expression in some phases of rural industry. The rural 
schools and the agricultural colleges codperate with one an- 
other. The rural schools are taught in excellent buildings, which 
are furnished and adorned so as to create self-respect and culti- 
vate an esthetic taste. The yards are neatly fenced and are 
beautiful with trees, flowers and shrubbery. Seeds are fur-

  nished to the pupils by the State Agricultural Department, and 
the results of their experiments are shown at State and county 
fairs. Thousands are attracted to these fairs to see the progress 
of the Illinois schools towards a better rural life. Every phase 
of farm industry, from the cultivation of vegetables to the im- 
provement of the breed of animals, is encouraged in the schools. 
Nor are the bettering of domestic affairs and the beautifying 
of homes neglected. And, too, the literary taste of the country 
people is being steadily elevated through the school libraries. 
The books not only reach the pupils, but the go into the country 
homes and brighten them. The young are learning to inter- 
pret literature through nature. 
The twentieth century will demand that Illinois, the pioneer 
in relating rural school education with rural life, be imitated 
by every State in the Union. This must be done if the soi! is 
to support the two hundred millions who will live here before 
the close of this century. 
Every city school system will, during the century, make man- 
ual training a prime factor in its course of study. All the pub- 
lic schools will be so related to every phase of human industry, 
that skill will be the rule with every toiler. The schools of the 
future will produce moral power, mental power and earning 
power. 
The social phase of our national life clusters about the home. 
It is to be most greatly benefited by the demands of the twen- 
tieth century on education. The home will reflect the charac- 
ter of the school. Indeed, this is largely true of the schools of 
today. Show me the homes of the community in which a teacher 
has long done service, and I will know the character of the 
school without visiting it. His character and instruction will, 
in some way, be reflected in the homes of his pupils, if, indeed, 
his character is strong and his instruction practical. The school 
may be reflected in the number and character of books to be 
found in the home; the pictures and other adornments; the 
manner of preparing and serving the food; the ventilation of 
the house; the appearance of the yard, and, in many other ways, 
if civic pride, which begins in the home and school, has been 
aroused and cultivated, may the character of the school be read 
in the home. 
The city, the State and the nation are only aggregations of

  homes. In proportion as these homes are made sweet and whole- 
some, morally, mentally, artistically and aesthetically, will the 
State be all of these. There is no way of separating the munici- 
pality from the individuals who compose it. Society can only 
be lifted to a higher plane by elevating the home, and this can 
be done most effectively through the public school. 
I believe in the higher education of woman. She should com- 
pass all knowledge, if she so desires. Indeed, she now has access 
to every avenue of learning which is enjoyed by man, and she 
has proven herself his peer in intellectual pursuits. And, too, 
I am willing to accord her the right to enter any of the learned 
professions which may suit her fancy or satisfy her bent. The 
man who is unwilling to stand the competition is either selfish or 
incompetent. And, if she can perform the service to which she 
has given her life, a well as man, she should have a man’s wages. 
As a rule, women who go out into the world of business under- 
value themselves, and those who employ them generally take 
them at their own valuation. When they demand a man’s wages 
for equal service they will get it. 
But, granting woman every right and privilege which the 
most advanced of them may demand for the sex, the fact re- 
mains that they are the only homemakers. Take her out of the 
home and immerse her in business, politics and the professions, 
and civilization will be the loser. Women is to the home what 
the soul is to the body, its light and hope. “A hundred men 
may make an encampment, but it takes a woman to make a 
home,” wisely says the Chinese proverb. The home is essential 
to civilization, and woman is essential to the home. The All- 
Wise Father has eminently fitted her for this divinely ordered 
sphere, and her soul turns to it as naturally as the flower lifts 
its head to the sky. Here, more than in any other sphere, has 
she vital feelings of delight. 
Since woman is essentially and predeterminedly the home- 
maker, twentieth century education will specially prepare her 
for her sacred calling. She shall have all the higher education 
she may desire, but special courses will be formulated that will 
make her a wise, as well as a loving, homemaker. Then, indeed, 
will it be true that “The hand that rocks the cradle is the hand 
that rules the world.” ‘Then, as real princesses, they may ap- 
proach the sleeping beauties of the home and awake them to a 
glorious physical, spiritual and intellectual life.

What the twentieth century will demand of the schools will 
require specially trained teachers. Before the close of the cen- 
tury the haphazard hit-or-miss teacher will be as curious and 
rare as a cambrian fossil. Unskilled hands wi'l not be per- 
mitted to play the harp whose living tones are left forever in the 
strings. 
In the selection of teachers character will be paramount, be- 
cause character should ever be the chief aim of education. 
Ability to teach will rank next; this will mean ability to adapt 
self and subject to the pupil, and ability to inspire action. 
Scholarship will rank next. It is the reserve power of the 
strong teacher, and, when wisely displayed, commands respect. 
In the twentieth century teacher it will be liberal and special. 
Culture will be deemed essential. It gives tone to the entire 
personality, for it is the development of the finer nature. It 
means good manners, good taste, refined thoughts, elegant ex- 
pression and pure spirit. And, too, every teacher will be versed 
in sociology. Since the child must become an organic part of 
society, the teacher must have an intelligent view of the child’s 
education to the needs of society. The needs of the child and 
society are reciprocal. The aim should be to individualize and 
socialize the child. 
In a word, the twentieth century will require all of its schools 
to be taught scientifically. This is far from being true at the 
beginning of the century. Asa rule, the best elementary schools 
are conducted more in accordance with scientific methods than 
are the high schools and colleges. The reformation must begin 
at the top. The universities must get away from their archaic 
methods. They must consider more the art of arousing the self- 
activity of the student, and inspiring self-expression. As a rule, 
college professors are selected because of their learning; but the 
man of great learning is not necessarily a great teacher. Apt- 
ness to teach, special training in methods of mind development, 
a knowledge of each individual student who may come within 
the circle of his influence, an inspiring enthusiasm for truth and 
power of arousing self-activity, are as essential to the college 
professors as in the teacher of the elementary schools. But, too 
often, these heads of our educational systems sneer at special 
methods and psychological insight. These have but one peda- 
gogical rule, the transference of knowledge. They attempt to
-P-A-G-E-86
    86 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
take bundles of facts from the shelves of memory, and hand 
them over to students to be stowed away on similar shelves. 
They fail to regard youth as an evolutionary being, whose de- 
velopment must correspond to that of the human race, but as 
so many measures capable of holding so much knowledge. Self- 
activity and self-expression are discouraged. This is why so 
many college men are failures in life. The twentieth century 
will demand that high school and college teachers shall not only 
have broad and deep learning, but that they shall have special 
training the methods of mind development and experience under 
model teachers. 
One of the greatest drawbacks to our high schools and col- 
leges is that few of their teachers know anything of adolescence, 
or have any adequate conception of the best ways and means of 
handling youth at this critical period of their existence. It is 
because of this that so many boys and girls leave these institu- 
tions before completing their education. Just at a time when 
they stand so much in need of sympathy, encouragement, gentle, 
though firm, discipline, and inspiration, they are misunderstood, 
repressed, and too often forced out of school. Thousands of 
boys who have quit school, failed or barely squeeze through, 
would have been more fortunate had their teachers understood 
adolesence. Dr. G. Stanley Hall, in his eset nes of 
this important subject, has rendered a great service to educa- 
tion and humanity. Every high school and college teacher 
should study it as closely as he ever did any text in his educa- 
tional career. It would be the means of saving thousands of 
youths who otherwise will be lost. 
Before the close of the century teaching will have become a 
profession second to none in sacredness, honor and compensa- 
tion. Too long have teachers been led to look for their reward 
in heaven. Earthly honors and emoluments have been scant, 
indeed. The time is not far distant when they shall inherit a 
fair proportion of the kingdom of earth as well as that of 
heaven. The great army of teachers who have been the van- 
guard of civilization, will demand and receive this material 
reward during the twentieth century. If they are faithful, pro- 
gressive and consecrated, they are assured of the welcome 
plaudit: “Well done, good and faithful servant!” 
It requires no prophetic eye to read the future, if in the com-

mon schools of America the constant and devoted aim is gen- 
eral efficiency, culture, and the ennobling and perpetuation of 
liberty. Looking into the future of this great realm, long ago 
dedicated to freedom and the pursuit of happiness, I behold a 
race of people, the amalgation of every nationality, tribe and 
tongue, prosperous, because they have been educated for ef- 
ficient service, intelligent through the influx of the racial mind 
into their own mental reservoirs, and swelling this great mind 
stream as it flows on into the eternal future, with nobler 
thoughts, higher aspirations and finer ideals. I behold a people, 
whose noble conception of liberty is untainted by license, unfet- 
tered by mental or physical bonds, the pure flame of freedom 
blazing on évery family altar, and every man and woman a self- 
constituted priest and priestess, intent on transmitting the holy 
fire to future altars, brighter and purer than it shone upon their 
own. I see a people, who, through the influence of such an edu- 
cation as the common schools will promote and maintain, have 
cast off the brute inheritance, and are ruled by the law of kind- 
ness, I behold a. people whose banner has no crimson bar 
among its silken folds, but only the blue of loyalty and the white 
of gentle peace, and whose implements of war have been fash- 
ioned into the utensils of pacific pursuits. I behold homes that 
are happy and righteous, fields that yield abundant harvests, 
shops whose skilled and intelligent workmen perform their 
tasks with such ease and facility that they have ample time for 
recreation and culture. I see a people whose domestic felicity 
is heavenly, and whose righteousness is uninfluenced by fear of 
punishment or hope of reward. I behold a people fashioned in 
the image of the Prince of Peace, whose hearts throb with the 
rhymthical beats of love, and upon whom the benignant smile 
of the Eternal Spirit will.ever shine as a national benedction. 
Tue CuHair: It is now my pleasure to introduce to you the 
first speaker of the evening, Dr. D. B. Johnson, President of 
Winthrop Normal and Industrial College, Rock Hill, South 
Carolina, who will address you on the subject of “The Educa- 
tion of the Southern Girl.” (Applause.)

THE EDUCATION OF THE SOUTHERN GIRL. 
DR. D. B. JOHNSON, ROCK HILL, 8. C. 
I do not propose to discuss the details of methods of instruc- 
tion in what I have to say on this subject. That would hardly 
be fitting for an occasion of this kind. I wish to make a plea 
for the practical education of the Southern girl, as well as for 
her literary and artistic education, and for a harmonious blend- 
ing of the practical, the literary, and the artistic in her educa- 
tion—for her education for all the duties of her life in home 
and community; and that for every dollar devoted to the educa- 
tion of Southern boys another dollar be devoted to the all-round 
education of Southern girls, who are as numerous as the boys, 
to say the least; as eager for preparation for life’s duties, as 
capable of receiving such preparation, and whose preparation 
for life’s duties is as important, if not more important, to the 
welfare of the State, and also for the maintenance of highest 
Southern ideals in her education. There are those qualities of 
mind and heart in the young womanhood of the South, inherited 
from mothers and grandmothers—gentleness, faithfulness, loy- 
alty, modesty, womanly charm, that we would not exchange for 
anything in the new education, and there is no need of making 
any exchange. We can have the best of the new and hold fast 
to the priceless heritage of the ideals handed down to us from 
one of the greatest people of this or any country. 
There have been great changes in the South in the last forty 
years as a result of the civil war. These changes have been so 
great and so many that we are said to have a “New South.” If 
so, we must not forget that this “New South” has been made 
possible by the ideals and virtues of the “Old South,” that the 
“new” is the outgrowth of the “old,” that the “new” has its roots 
deep down in the “old.” There is a tendency to surrender our 
ideals of life and of education in favor of those of the section 
of the Union which proved the stronger in the war and has been 
more prosperous since, until recently controlling, on account of 
that prosperity, the great publications of the country which 
mould public opinion. We are prone to undervalue, if not to 
belittle the splendid virtues and achievements of the old civiliza- 
tion because they cannot be measured by the new “dollar” stand-
-P-A-G-E-89
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 89 
  ard, which is being adopted through the South to our serious 
injury. 
It is incumbent upon the leaders of the South in business, in 
politics, and in the professions, to earnestly resist this tendency. 
It is the intellectual, the spiritual life, rather than material 
prosperity, that determines the greatness of a people. “Man 
shall not live by bread alone.” We must seek first the intel- 
lectural, the spiritual things, and then all these other things will 
be added unto us. 
The South is the pioneer in this country in the field of fe- 
male education. Thomas Jefferson introduced in the General 
Assembly of the State of Virginia as early as 1779 a bill look- 
ing to the education of both boys and girls. This proposed edu- 
cation of girls preceded by ten years the admission of girls to 
the common schools of Boston. In 1790 girls were first ad- 
mitted to the public grammar schools of Boston for a part only 
of the school year. 
The first colleges for women in this country were established 
in the South, the oldest being the Salem Academy and College, 
established at Salem, N. C., in 1802, and Wesleyan College for 
Women in Georgia. A Moravian Seminary for young ladies, 
established at Bethlehem, Pa., probably in 1749, may be an ex- 
ception to this statement. But it must be admitted that the 
South, together with every other country, undervalued and neg- 
lected the education of women generally until comparatively 
recently. There was no adequate system of free public educa- 
tion for the children in the South before the civil war, owing to 
peculiar social conditions, but, in Dr. Alderman’s opinion, “It is 
doubtful if there were anywhere in the world, outside of Scot- 
land, better schools for the training of the few than existed in 
the South at that time.” 
Dr. Curry, in speaking of the educational opportunities fur- 
nished in the South before the war, says, “It must not be sup- 
posed that, because prior to the war the Southern States had 
no system of public schools for universal education, they were 
negligent of the duty of supplying a large number of the white 
population with instructions of the highest order. By the cen- 
sus of 1860, when the North had a population of 19,000,000 and 
the South had 8,000,000, the North had 205 colleges, 1,407 pro- 
fessors, and 29,044 students; the South had 262 colleges, 1,488  
-P-A-G-E-90
90 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  professors and 27,055 students; the North expended for col- 
leges per annum $1,514,688, and for academies $4,663,748, while 
the South expended for colleges $1,662,419, and for academies 
$4,328,127. Besides these, in nearly every State, there were de- 
nominational colleges, and I make bold to say that the educa- 
tion furnished according to the existing courses of study was in 
all respects equal to that furnished elsewhere. Webster once 
exclaimed of Massachusetts, “There she is—she speaks for her- 
self!’ With equal boastfulness the South may say of the edu- 
cation furnished, “There are her men—they speak for them- 
selves.” “What portion of the world can surpass our Marshall, 
Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Henry, Rutledge, Pinckneys, 
Calhoun, Clay and scores of others? Obliterate from our his- 
tory what these men have achieved and how barren it would 
be!” 
Testimony from the North to the high equality of the product 
of Southern civilization and education is given in a speech de- 
livered before the New England Society of Charleston, S. ©., by 
that profound student and ‘thinker, the late Senator Hoar, of 
Massachusetts, in the following language: “It was South Caro- 
lina whose lightning stroke smote the invader by the arm of 
Marion, and whose wisdom guided the framers of the Constitu- 
tion through the lips of Rutledge and Gadsden and Pinckney.” 
“The American people have learned to know as never before 
the quality of the Southern stock and to value its noble con- 
tribution to the American character; its courage in war; its at- 
tachment to home; its capacity for great affection and generous 
emotion; its aptness for command; above all, its constancy— 
that virtue above all virtues, without which no people can long 
be either great or free. After all, the fruit of this vine has a 
flavor not to be found in other gardens.” 
Are not ideals made and represented by such a people worthy 
of preservation? Do such a people have to imitate the profes- 
sional or educational methods of anybody? 
The quality of no stock in history was ever put to a severer 
test than the quality of the Southern people by the civil war 
and reconstruction. The South was left prostrate financially 
and industrially after the war. The property values had de- 
creased by 1870 as a result of the war and reconstruction to the 
extent of two billion dollars. The cost of the war alone to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 91 
South was one-tenth of her male population and three billions 
of property. Reconstruction left upon the South, on top of its 
impoverished condition, a crushing bonded debt of over $300,- 
000,000. 
Under such a staggering load as this, and with the old system 
of society overturned and new and untried problems to face, the 
Southern people bravely set to work to rebuild their fortunes 
and institutions. The “hero in gray with heart of gold,” who 
refused to sit down in sullenness and despair when he returned 
home to almost complete devastation, set an example which all 
loyal sons and daughters of the South followed. The magnifi- 
cent mettle of the people is attested by the fact that within 
twenty years, from 1880 to 1900, according to Dr. Wicliffe Rose, 
the South increased its wages paid to factory hands from $76,- 
000,000 to $350,000,000; its production of pig iron from 397,000 
tons to 2,500,000; its output of coal from 6,000,000 tons to 50,- 
000,000 tons. During the same period the total output of her 
manufactured products was increased from $338,791,898 to $1,- 
173,422,565. The development of textile industries within the 
same period was phenomenal. The number of spindles was in- 
creased from 667,000 in 1880, to 5,000,000 in 1899. In the one 
year, 1890, there were erected in the South 365 new cotton mills, 
as against 17 in the New England States. Since the war agri- 
cultural South Carolina has become the second State in the 
Union in cotton factories. 
A people who can accomplish such results as these in indus- 
trial life in the face of so many difficulties, can accomplish 
equally great results in educational matters, especially with the 
means at their. command furnished by these industrial ac- 
tivities. 
Great and sudden wealth, however, with accompanying new 
conditions, new adjustments and new ideas, is fraught with 
much danger to both individuals and a people. Prosperity is 
often a greater test of character than adversity. The South is 
in danger of modifying its standards, its cherished ideals. A 
cartoon in a leading Southern newspaper some time ago ex- 
presses my thought. A great dollar mark standing for commer- 
cialism is represented as casting the black shadow of moral de- 
generacy and intellectual degradation over the land. There is 
too great a tendency to worship at the shrine of a pervasive com- 
mercialism.

It is the special duty and privilege of all those in the South 
occupying positions similar to those of the members of this As- 
sociation to guard against lowering the high Southern ideals 
in regard to one of the most precious interests of the South, if 
not the most precious, the education and training of Southern 
young womanhood. 
The character of a civilization is not only guaged by the treat- 
ment and position of woman under it, but it is determined in 
great measure by that position and training. In darkest Africa 
the woman is the slave, the burden bearer; but in lands of the 
highest civilization she is liberated from this serfdom, this sup- 
pression, and her powers set free to accomplish the great re- 
sults already set down to her credit in such lands. 
An editorial in a recent issue of The News and Courier of 
South Carolina, taking an Atlanta, Ga., paper severely to task 
for asserting that the South’s greatest asset is its men, so ad- 
mirably gives the position of woman in the South and her incal- 
culable value to its civilization, that I cannot refrain from quot- 
ing it in part. The editor says: 
“We scorn the lack of gallantry displayed by our contemporary, but 
the inaccuracy of which it is guilty requires censure. Whatever great- 
ness the South has known, whatever she has achieved, bas been due to 
the women, and doubtless what she may achieve hereafter will be due 
to the women also. However heroic were Southern men in the civil 
war, the women who stayed at home were the real martyrs. 
The South has superb men today, but they are no greater, no better asset 
than the women. Some Southern men have failed in the supreme test. 
Have Southern women? Southern men, a great many of them, left the 
country in the time of its most dire need. Southern women stayed at 
home. They never sacrificed their ideals, never faltered in their trust. 
Their optimism bas made our present prosperity. Their faith is the 
promise of tomorrow. ‘The insipration they have given has been the 
keynote of our progress. There is scarcely a Southern man of any 
prominence today who does not trace the best that is in him to a 
woman, If deeds are not to be the criteria of our progress, but our 
assets are to be measured in personal terms, it ill behooves the Atlanta 
Constitution or any other paper to talk about men as the South’s great- 
est asset. The South is the South because of its women.” 
It gives me pleasure to state that South Carolina will soon 
unveil at the capital a noble monument to her noble women of 
the Confederacy. 
Dr. David Starr Jordan, of Leland Stanford, Jr., University,

well says: “The highest product of a social evolution is the 
growth of the civilized home—the home that only a wise, culti- 
vated, and high-minded woman can make. To furnish such 
women is one of the worthiest functions of higher education.” 
And he might have gone further and said in truth that the home 
is the very foundation of civilization—upon it must rest the wel- 
fare of a people. As is the home, so is the community, the State, 
and the Nation. We believe so strongly in training young 
women for homemaking, that we have at Winthrop College pro- 
vision for teaching cooking, sewing household economics and 
gardening, and maintain a small average home for practice in 
housekeeping. We give our students practice, also, in social 
and community service in mill and country communities. It is 
not form of government by which men are made or unmade. It 
is the character and influence of their mothers and wives. As 
a rule great men have great mothers. “The man of tomorrow 
is what the girl of today will make him.” 
It is imperative that the sex that furnishes 80 per cent of the 
teachers and all of the mothers shall be made efficient by the 
right kind of education. Kate Douglas Wiggin, author of “Re- 
becca of Sunnybrook Farm” and other well known stories, in- 
sists that young women should be given training to fit them for 
motherhood. She contends that girls and young women should 
be given the training that will make them proficient in the most 
practical and most fundamental homemaking tasks, that will 
give them actual experience with children, that will teach them 
how to feed the children, how to dress them, and how to amuse 
them. She holds that it should lay emphasis upon the discipline 
and training of children and their early education, that it 
should cover the beautiful as well as the practical side of life. 
She insists that the right kind of a school for women should 
turn out its graduates fitted not only to keep house, but to make 
a home; that it should prepare girls not only to be capable 
nurses for their children, if need be, but to be mothers; that it 
should give to the American home enthusiastic, beauty loving, 
conscientious and intelligent mothers and wives. Miss Wiggins’ 
attitude toward woman suffrage is interesting and refreshing. 
Asked the other day when she was in Richmond how she stood 
on the issue, she remarked that she did not stand at all, but was 
very much like a New England farmer’s wife whose ideas about
-P-A-G-E-94
94 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  the opposite sex were not excessively romantic. This good 
woman, content with her household duties, and graciously ac- 
cepting as a matter of course the multitude of cares that come 
to one in such an atmosphere, was hurrying from churn to sink, 
and from sink to shed, and then back to the kitchen stove. When 
asked if she wished to vote, she replied with haughty air and a 
vigorous movement of the churn-dasher, “No! I certainly do 
not. If there is any one thing the men can do alone, let them 
do it.” 
The white illiteracy of the South, which is giving our thought- 
ful leaders so much concern, could be speedily obliterated by 
educating all of the white women of the South. An educated 
mother will not tolerate illiteracy in her family. 
In this great and vital work for our country, shall the leaders 
in women’s education be governed by the high ideals and fine 
traditions of Southern womanhood, or shall they borrow the 
ideals of other sections of the country? There can be but one 
answer. 
The ideals of the South have proven their worth by the won- 
- derful achievements of the people dominated by them, and by 
the fruitage of the civilization of that people. We have our own 
background and our own conditions.. If our civlization has de- 
veloped anything worth preserving, we should not allow aims 
and methods in other sections to lead us to ignore these things 
or to undervalue them. The right of woman to higher educa- 
tion having already been justified by the women’s colleges that 
have already risen to the front rank, we in the South are in posi- 
tion now to ask ourselves the question, not whether women can 
take higher education, but what kind of higher education is best 
fitted for them and also called for by our own problems. 
There has been extraordinary progress in education in the 
South in recent years, and for that matter in the whole country, 
and the colleges for both men and women, as a result, are facing 
the future with many problems so far-reaching and funda- 
mental that the wisdom and experience of many years will be re- 
quired for their solution, 
Not until the middle of the nineteeth century were there 
more than a dozen colleges for women in this country attended 
by a few hundred of students. In 1907, according to the United 
States Bureau of Education, there were 53,125 women in col-
-P-A-G-E-95
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 95 
  leges, co-educational as well as for women alone, as compared 
with 96,575 men in co-educational colleges and in colleges for 
men. On account of this remarkable growth and expansion and 
the many new demands upon them, the Southern colleges for 
women have not yet definitely and finally settled upon what 
studies should be required of their students. 
In all of this work I would not be understood for a moment 
as advocating a “Chinese wall” or “ostrich” policy on our part. 
We may learn many things from experience of others, and 
should do so, and one of the most important sometimes is “how 
not to do it.” 
As surely as a man looks solely at his own business, so surely 
will be become narrow. Breadth of view and literality, the very 
breath of life of true learning, are secured by becoming ac- 
quainted with work similar to ours elsewhere. 
In the matter of entrance requirements and standards of 
scholarship for degrees for both men and women, we are free to 
admit that we are not up to the colleges in some other sections 
of the country, but this is because of the lower level, and in 
many sections of the country the entire lack of secondary schools 
in the South. I rejoice that this need of secondary schools is 
being rapidly supplied now in nearly all the Southern States. 
While believing that the education for women should give an 
“equal degree of breadth and thoroughness and equal fitness for 
high thinking and wise acting” as that for men, yet we do not 
believe that the curricula for women’s colleges should be copies 
of those of colleges for men. They should be equivalent, but not 
identical. Education is the preparation of the individual, man 
or woman, for life and the duties of life. Woman should be edu- 
cated for woman’s work, and man for man’s work. 
We of the South have never believed in co-education, and I 
am glad to see that the rest of the country is coming to our posi- 
tion in this matter. In a recent issue of the Boston Transcript 
appears this item: 
“The separation of the sexes in the public high schools, as well as 
the private secondary institutions, will doubtless in the fullness of time 
be complete in this State. Wesleyan Academy is not one in which we 
should have expected it so soon, because a large alumni constituency 
desire for their daughters as well as their sons the opportunities and 
the associations which they have enjoyed. But sentiment must give 
way before the pressure, if not the logic, of events. In Connecticut the

action of the university in terminating the co-educational relation has 
the project to establish a woman’s college in that State a strong im- 
pulse,” 
  We do not wish man-making methods for woman-making pur- 
poses. The functions and work of men and women differ, and 
their training should differ. They should supplement each 
other. Bishop Goucher has well said, “We should not refer to 
man and woman as superior and inferior, for each without the 
other is incomplete. Neither has a sphere, each is but a hemis- 
phere, ‘and they shall be one.’”” Though we may train women 
for housekeeping and not men, yet it must not be forgotten that 
housekeeping requires soundness of judgment, keenness of per- 
ception, quickness of decision, promptness of execution, all the 
highest powers at their best, to meet the manifold responsibili- 
ties and emergencies which arise. 
We fly in the face of nature if we give the same course of 
study to man and woman, between whom there is a natural line 
of division. 
We do not wish to produce the coldly intellectual woman— 
the mannish woman—without grace or heart or charm. We do 
not wish to produce the woman who in pursuit of scholarship 
for its own sake loses all interest in home, humanity and social 
service. ‘ 
We believe in that education of woman that produces healthy 
bodies, cultured minds and Christian characters; which blends 
the theoretical and practical in a way to make a harmonious 
union of learning and life; which produces womanliness, truth- 
fulness, graciousness, unselfishness, a willingness and the 
ability, forgetting self, to serve others—which fits for society 
and the home and for self-support, if need be. 
We believe that the personality, the individuality, of students 
should be taken into account; that their esthetic, social and 
spiritual needs should be cared for; that trust begets reliability 
and loyalty, induces self-reliance and self-control, and that char- 
acter building is the keystone of the whole educational struc- 
ture. 
We are to prove all things, holding fast to that which is good 
in the old and the new, and not to discard something because it 
is old, or accept something because it is new. 
We, the educators of the South, have splendid opportunities

   for creative work in our special field. We should be receptive 
and open-minded, but alert and critical. It would be folly not 
to profit by the experience of others. But let us be careful not 
to throw aside the old, true and tried ideals, which have come 
to us through war, and fire, and adversity, unscathed and un- 
dimmed, for untried and doubtful new ideals, however much 
that may glitter, and however much enchantment distance may 
lend them.

that every member of the Board be present. 
It gives me great pleasure to present to you Dr. B. C. Hager-

THE EDUCATION OF THE SOUTHERN GIRL. 
DR. B. C. HAGERMAN, LEXINGTON, KY. 
   
    
                                 
    Education is self-realization, the leading out in body, mind 
and spirit of every inborn force, and so adjusting it to the en- 
vironment of one’s lot that the individual may attain in his 
strivings the highest good. The purpose of an education, there- 
fore, is to fit the recipient to live, and that is the wisest educa- 
tion which brings the man or woman to think the noblest and 
live the best. 
The time allotted to our paper is not adequate to this trans- 
cendent theme. It is like the according of an hour to a guide to 
show the traveler New York or London, or fifteen minutes in 
which to point out the wonders of the British Museum, or to 
explain the merits of the masterpieces of art in the great gal- 
leries of Florence or Rome. 
In the first place, the word education is a word that neither 
Webster nor Wooster nor any dictionary that was written in 
the yesterday can define. Webster’s or Wooster’s definition is 
the grain of mustard seed which yesterday was the smallest 
among seeds, but today has become the greatest among herbs. 
Education is an acorn in this generation; in the next it is the

  mighty oak with wide outspreading branches towering into the 
heavens. 
It enlarges its significance to keep pace with the civilization 
of the nations. Indeed, a nation’s conception of the word is the 
measure of its civilization and its right to a place of dignity and 
standing among the other nations of the world. 
Of course, our dictionaries can give the etymology of the 
word; they say it is leading out, development; as I said in the 
opening of my paper, it is self-realization; but this is only the 
geographical outline. As one would say of America, it is a 
country bounded on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the west 
by the Pacific, on the north by Canada and Alaska, on the south 
by Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico, but is this our America? 
What of her great, never-resting industries, her splendid cities, 
her costly temples of religion and education, her teeming mil- 
lions of freemen, as fine specimens of manhood and womanhood 
as live anywhere under the blue skies. 
So our word education has its inner life and meaning, which 
is greater or less according to the scale of enlightenment in 
which we find the individual who gives it utterance. Our sys- 
tem of education from the kindergarten to the university grows 
with the nation’s growth, and is at all times a revelation of a 
nation’s heart thought and of a nation’s ideals. The Spartan’s 
culture was largely physical and its end was strength and endur- 
ance; the Greek’s aim was intellectual strength and artistic 
beauty; the Roman’s was worldly power; the Renaissance a 
kind of wsthetic classical culture, while our own America, espe- 
cially in this generation, is insisting upon a full, rounded, whole- 
some development of the whole being, which will produce 
strength of body, beauty of character, and a type of manhood 
and womanhood that shall lead in all civic virtues and give the 
largest service in a useful citizenship to our country. 
When we come, however, to discuss what sort of education 
we shall give to our girls, and to our Southern girls, the ques- 
tion becomes more specific and difficult. I think educators are 
about agreed that all true education must result in fitting one 
to live the best, and the best measure of one’s worth is the 
service one renders to the community in which he is fated to 
spend the allotted years. 
Now we have iong decided what a boy may elect to do. We
-P-A-G-E-99
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 99 
grant him the whole round of the world’s industries and learned 
professions from which to make his lordly choice, but the 
woman, what may she with public or masculine approval do? 
It is only within a generation that she has been conceded the 
right to be educated. It is but a short time since in enlightened 
England, a census was taken of 80,000 mothers in their homes, 
and the appalling fact was revealed that 68,000 of them could 
not read or write. It has not been long since a prominent man 
and leading educator said, “It was not necessary and was a 
piece of extravagance to spend the public money to educate 
women.” 
So if education is to fit for a life purpose, how shall we edu- 
cate our girls? I am glad to say that there is to be found a host 
of the world’s elect who are ready to say, educate our girls so 
that they may be ready to do anything honorable and of good 
report for which their talents best fit them. I also am glad of 
another fact, that it is no longer necessary to make any marked 
difference between the education of the Southern girl and the 
girl in any portion of our great country. Since the day when 
the fires that consumed Southern homes went out, and the dark 
retinue of Southern slaves melted away in the smoke of battle, 
the gentle, refined, self-indulgent Southern girl has arisen with 
the same heroic courage that her mother evinced in meeting the 
perils and hardships of that desolating war, and unflinchingly 
faces the demands of a new age, where a woman must do with 
her own hands and heart her share in the work of this busy 
age, and in a spirit of noble self-reliance take her part in solving 
the hard problems in our country’s steady march toward a 
purer and more enlightened civilization. 
Deplorable were those days of desolation, of fires and of tears 
and of blood, but God in his providence has wrought out of it 
a brighter day for all of our beloved South. It was a goodly 
day for the education of our Southern womanhood when the 
reign of the private tutor was abolished, the educator that 
rarely educated, and when the Southern girl was brought out 
from behind the walls of her private home into competition in 
the public class-room with her intellectual peers, and upon her 
was brought to bear the inspiration of competition with the 
youth of her own age and community. By this change she need 
lose nothing of gentleness and refinement, and yet make price-

  less gain in the strength and broadness of a self-reliant woman- 
hood. 
Therefore, taking the whole situation of the Southern girl as 
she now is and as life now opens up before her, how should she 
be educated? I do not conceive, as stated before, that the an- 
swer to the question for her differs from the answer that ought 
to be given to womanhood in any other part of our great coun- 
try. I think that all will agree that the answer to this question 
is, that a woman ought to be educated in the light of what she is 
to do and to be. The girls of today will be the women of tomor- 
row, and their duties and responsibilities will be very similar to 
our women of today. 
In what, then, does this closing month of this world’s greatest 
year find the women of our Southland engaged? A few 
of them are doctors and lawyers and preachers, many more of 
them are teachers in our schools, a large number are in commer- 
cial life, some are gay butterflies of society, but the large ma- 
jority of them, we gratefully affirm, are the queens of our hos- 
pitable Southern homes. 
We must by education minimize the number of the thought- 
lessly idle, and send out into all the various employments 
stronger, better equipped, and more efficient workers. How 
then is this to be done? I answer, by recognizing in the very 
beginning of our teaching the threefold nature with which we 
are to deal, and from the kindergarten to the university assidu- 
ously cultivate the body, mind and spirit of the immortal crea- 
ture whose destiny is committed to our charge. This is God’s 
will in the education of our girls, and nothing less ought to 
satisfy the will of man. 
This holy triune has not been regarded as it should be in the 
education of our Southern girls. Due amount of emphasis has 
been put upon the culture of the mind, yet the body and spirit 
have been left largely to chance for their development. I want, 
therefore, to emphasize the necessity of giving in our educa- 
tional system of the future a more prominent and rational place 
to the physical and spiritual education. 
We jestingly speak of the “pale student” and the “scholar’s 
stoop,” but it is a pathetic commentary upon our system of edu- 
cation. What does it profit the young girl who gains a world 
of book knowledge, but in the gaining loses the vigor of her
-P-A-G-E-101

  physical life? “Mens sana in corpore sano”—this old adage of 
a “sound mind in a sound body” has long been on our lips, but 
has been an utter stranger until quite late years to the practice 
of our schools. It does not yet get its due importance in our 
educational system. Our educational work ought to put a 
greater elasticity into the step of our girls, a healthier flush 
into their cheeks, a brighter flash into their eyes, and send them 
out not only with mind strong and alert, but with every nerve 
tingling with good health and a surplus energy, ready to ex- 
press itself in an active part of the best work of the life circles 
into which they may go. Good health is heaven’s gift to our 
young women; our schools have no right to rob them of it. 
When our schools begin, as they will some day, with the kinder- 
garten, and scientifically and conscientiously educate the body 
as they do the mind, through all the grades of public high school 
and college courses, then shall the hollow-chested, nervous, hys- 
terical girl disappear, and in her place we shall have a grace- 
ful, joyous creature, blessing the home with her gracious help- 
fulness. 
We can do little to help those of mature age. Our fathers 
and mothers are immersed in the pursuit of business and pleas- 
ure. They take no physical exercise worthy of the name. They 
are expending tremendous energy in acquiring money, and then 
almost as much in spending what has been acquired, as some 
one says, “Thus burning the candle at both ends.” Our method 
of life tends to physical degeneration, and the result is already 
alarming in the highest degree. 
Something must be done to help the young born under such 
circumstances. Irritable, flat-chested fathers, and nervous, com- 
plaining, fretful mothers, can never give strong, beautiful chil- 
dren to our race. It is a joy to see that the South is beginning 
to realize that an education is a preparation for complete liv- 
ing, and that good health is the basis of every happy and suc- 
cessful life. Our schools have been asleep to this supreme need 
and have looked at good health as a gift from heaven, rather 
than something to be attained by wise and continuous physical 
culture. Under the influence of this thought we are demand- 
ing better school houses, located and ventilated with reference 
to sane laws of sanitation, medical inspectors, daily physical 
exercises under teachers trained for this work just as are those  
-P-A-G-E-102

who teach the literary branches. We have not yet reached it, 
but I hope soon to see the day inaugurated, when as much dig- 
nity shall be attached to the chair of physical director of the 
college and school as any other; when this department shall be 
treated, not as a side issue as it now is, and largely left to shift 
for itself, but shall be considered an integral part of the college 
curriculum, and that a thorough physical course shall be made 
as essential to graduation as mathematics, the classics, science, 
or literature. When this is done, we shall build up for our 
young women a constitution that shall have power to throw off 
disease, and bodies clothed with such strength as shall make life 
a joy for them, and in the home they shall be helpmeets worthy 
of the name. 
I do not try to tell in detail how this training is to be done; 
as soon as fathers and mothers and teachers awake to the vital 
necessity of the doing, a way will soon be found and a course 
mapped out by which it may be efficiently accomplished, as 
clear and as uniform as the course which we now have mapped 
out for the development of the mind. Such training will soon 
give us in our youth not only stronger bodies, but brighter 
minds and cleaner souls. 
I have stopped to put this stress upon bodily development 
and training, not because it is the most important, but because 
the sentiment in its favor is so feeble, if we are to judge by the 
meager preparation that has yet been made for its attainment, 
especially in our public schools and in many of our colleges. 
The intellectual discipline of our girls, though not perfect, 
is creditable, and is greatly improving in our Southland every 
year. While there may be a crowding of what we call the pure 
culture studies in view of the time allotted to school life, yet 
our theory and practice here is so much better than the atten- 
tion given to the other two parts of what I called the holy 
triune to be cultivated in the education of our girls, that with- 
out laying any stress upon the mind training, I hastened on to 
that neglected field, the culture of the soul. And as the great 
Christian apostle once said in discussing this great topic, “Now 
abideth faith, hope, love; these three, but the greatest of these 
is love,” so say I now abideth the body, mind and spirit, but the 
greatest of these is spirit. For the strongest body shall soon see 
the day when it must bow down under the weight of years, and
-P-A-G-E-103
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 103 
  the mind shall forget the knowledge it has gleaned, but the 
spirit is to go on growing through endless years, for it is the 
image of God that is not to be marred by time or death. 
The great weakness of our school system today is, that it 
finds its goal almost exclusively in intellectual accomplish- 
ments. When this goal is reached, a diploma is put into the 
hands of a girl or boy who stands bewildered, having no vision 
of the world’s needs, and hearing no call to come forth and con- 
tribute his share to the world’s happiness and goodness. The 
girls thus educated go out to flit about and have a good time; 
the boys to drift, until some necessity throws upon them the 
harness ef service, which service they too often render sulllenly 
because there is nc inspiring motive built up within by a right 
education, which makes doing a joy, and all true needed service 
rendered to a needy world an inestimable privilege. The but- 
terflies of society, and the man who grinds the hours of the day 
and the days of the year into dollars, as if he were some in- 
genious mechanical device with no heart and no ulterior par- 
pose, are both made in a large degree by our imperfect system 
of education. 
The social evils that prevail today, the low standards upon 
which much of our commercial business is carried on, the parti- 
san corruption in politics; strife, bitterness, immorality and 
crime, all these cry out to our State to hasten to bring relief, 
and the strength of the nation in attaining any real deliverance 
from these things lies in her schools, her colleges and her uni- 
versities. Good morals are as much a matter of attainment as 
a knowledge of mathematics, and when a pupil begins to learn 
the A, B, C of the kindergarten, he also ought to be taught the 
alphabet of right conduct. The final end of all effort, all ac- 
tivity in nation or individual, is character. Everything else is 
incidental. Character is not of mushroom growth; it is not 
formed in a night; it is rather made as the coral islands in the 
silent blue sea depths—line upon line, precept upon precept, 
habit upon habit, until it becomes a mighty, deep-rooted thing, 
which the waves of doubt and temptation do not disturb. 
“Tis the miracle of the age that a nation with as enlightened 
civilization as our own, with as great churches and costly 
schools and colleges, should be so slow to see that we are taking 
care of the box and leaving the marble statue to lie in the gut-
-P-A-G-E-104
104 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  ter; that the soul is the kernel of the man, and that we are tak- 
ing care of the shell and making little or no appeal to man’s 
real essence. I know, of course, here and there are to be found 
schools that are bravely trying to appeal to and train the moral 
nature of its students, but this matter is vital to the whole na- 
tion’s good, and it needs a united, rational effort to do the big- 
gest and most important work it has ever done. 
It is not enough that there should be incidental references to 
great moral themes in teaching the different subjects to be 
found in literary training, but there should be in every school 
teachers whose whole time and thought should be given to the 
moral training. Princely men and women they should be, com- 
ing into daily contact with our girls and boys, and holding up 
before them lofty ideals of honor, truth, justice, duty, service, 
character and kindred themes. Then they should train them in 
habits of industry, obedience to authority, fairness in dealing, 
absolute honesty in work, self-respect, respect for others, loyalty 
to friendship, love of country, and the fear of God. Wise, ef- 
ficient, consecrated teaching along these lines will wipe out our 
gross national evils in a generation, and send into our business 
circles, into our homes and into society so splendid a woman- 
hood and manhood that there shall be rejoicing in our land like 
that which prevailed in Egypt when the shadows of the afflict- 
ing plagues were removed. 
Much of what I have suggested is as applicable to the educa- 
tion of the boy as to the girl—my particular theme. Indeed, 
there need be but few points where the education of the boy and 
the girl need part company. Of course the girl is the home- 
maker, and here she needs certain special instruction that ought 
to be given her in her school training. The responsibilities and 
the requirement of a model home ought to be frequently brought 
before her, and, as far as possible, she ought to be given the in- 
struction essential to meet these requirements. “She ought to 
be fitted,” as some one has said, “to make and inspire the home; 
to lessen suffering and increase happiness; to aid mankind in its 
upward struggles; to ennoble and adorn life’s work, however 
humble; these are woman’s high prerogatives.” 
Even when the world was young and woman first walked 
forth on the stage of life, Adam looked upon her queenly beauty 
and into her glowing eyes, and with an unclouded vision, named
-P-A-G-E-105

her Eve, or Life, and God said it is well. She was the crowning 
act in the last drama of creation, and robed in all the charms 
and graces of our beautful humanity justly laid claim to our 
loyal allegiance and unswerving affection. 
“Last came a female form more soft, more fair, 
And Eden smiled to see the stranger there; 
Then tones of joy from harps seraphic rung, 
The stars of morning in their courses sung, 
Earth echoed back a shout of grateful love 
From every valley, cavern, stream and grove. 
Man, filled with praise, in solemn rapture stood, 
God looked to view his work, and God pronounced it good.” 
Woman’s place then, in the drama of creation, the name given 
her by man under Divine approval, indicates her mission. Her 
name in Hebrew, Havah; in Greek, Zoe; in English, Eve or life 
—she giveth life, not the mere physical life of humanity, but 
she is the leader, the life and spirit of all true and real civiliza- 
tion. Where woman is respected, educated, honored, this is the 
test from which there is no appeal, of the grade of civilization 
of every nation on the wide, inhabited earth. 
America must continue to lead all nations in the homage 
paid to womanhood. She is the efficient helper in business cir- 
cles, the much loved teacher in our schools, the charming queen 
in our homes, the spotless saint in our churches, the spirit of life 
in all our movements toward national righteousness. We must 
see to it that no defect in our educational system shall rob her 
of her coronal of supreme usefulness, that by a wise and gener- 
ous training in body, mind and spirit, the holy triune of her 
nature, she shall grow more and more to be the intelligent help- 
meet of man in secular affairs, the revered teacher in our 
schools, the charming mother in our homes, the gentle saint in 
our churches, and the mistress of the moral destinies of our 
race.

THE ETHICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE COLLEGE 
WOMAN. 
  DR. LOUJS F. SNOW, WELLS COLLEGE, N. Y. 
In a gallery of paintings, a series of pictures represented the 
nine muses. Individually the faces differed. The symbols 
adorning each portrait were appropriate to the art represented. 
Clio held her scroll, Melpomene her lyre. Each goddess with 
varied pose suggested the special phases of culture she held in 
her keeping. Yet, as became the daughters of a common father, 
all reproduced in their countenances a noticeable resemblance. 
The college woman of America, in similar variety, alter some- 
what as this or that institution claims their allegience. The 
Vassar woman is distinctly different from her sister at Welles- 
ley; Smith and Oberlin may be distinguished from Chicago. 
The Southern circle of colleges, from Virginia to Louisiana, 
flashes with as varied and as brilliant splendors as those pulses 
of pale flames which presage in the heavens the oncoming of the 
Northern lights. Each school of the higher learning, from 
Sophie Newcomb to Minnesota, has its distinctive type of excel- 
lence, which, to an extent, is embodied in each of its graduates. 
Yet these graduates have also a noticeable resemblance in their 
common ideals—ideals which are a part of our common heri- 
tage. 
Here in America, college education for women was not an 
accident, but a result. If, as one of the latest French philos- 
ophers asserts, the present is but the past biting into the future, 
or as one of our own poets has beautfully phrased it: 
“Bverything fels a stir of might— 
An instinct within it which reaches and towers 
And groping blindly above it for light, 
Climbs to a soul.” ' 
and thus realizes the potentialities of its own existence, the pe- 
culiar type of education called collegiate was, for woman, 
merely the culmination of a process in the development and or- 
ganization of her powers in her groping, blind effort to adapt
-P-A-G-E-107

herself to the changing conditions of our ever-increasingly com- 
plicated civilization. 
The simple life of the Colonial dame produced no demand for 
the college course. Restricted, as the curriculum was, to the 
subjects preparatory to the study of divinity, the college was a 
thing too remote from her daily life to invite her attention or 
attract her interest. The diversified activities of her routine 
of duties at home, or about the farm or plantation, provided 
adequate mental stimulus, and guarded her from sluggishness 
of thought and unsystematic methods. A literary training 
sufficient to enable her to cast simple accounts and to read the 
Scriptures gave her a hold upon practical affairs and an insight 
into things spiritual, which formed the groundwork of a faith 
sublime—in some cases transcendent—and always wrought to- 
ward the accomplishment in her of the perfection of the fruits 
of the spirit—love, joy, peace, long-suffering. Her children 
were trained by her in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. 
She herself oftentimes— 
  “Climbed and saw the very God—the highest, 
Stand upon the paved work of a sapphire, 
Like to the bodied heavens in his clearness 
Shone the stone, the sapphire of that paved work, 
When they ate and drank and saw God also.” 
The God-fearing women of the Colonial era were the mothers 
of our grandparents of the Revolutionary time, who entered 
upon and lived their lives simply and courageously emulous, 
only to reach the best standards set by the past. They bear the 
name of revolutionists, and the course of political events forced 
them to destroy the old order of affairs temporal, but their 
spiritual hopes and aspirations remained secure, and they bit- 
terly defended against all attacks of infidels, free-thinkers and 
rationalists, the God-given arrangements transmitted to their 
keeping by their ancestors. As political architects, they became 
constructionists of a new and better order. But their faith was 
firmly fixed, and the moral standards remained unchanged amid 
all the hardships of war, of famine, the pains of sickness and 
the pangs of death, to be transmitted to their children as a 
richer legacy than it had been received. 
The troublous nature of the times well-nigh destroyed all the 
higher education for the men. The round of duties, which still
-P-A-G-E-108
108 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  fell to the lot of women, prevented all thought of their under- 
taking this work. Bond servants might relieve the mistress of 
drudgery, but the care and responsibility of supervision took its 
place. As yet there were no labor-saving devices to help. The 
only relief came from the union of many hands. Skill in direct- 
ing these developed in the Revolutionary grandmother execu- 
tive power. The value of the virtues of thoroughness, diligence 
and care became impressed when the workmen failed in their 
duty. Her ethics became practical as the problems of daily life 
clamored for solution, and she strove to transmit to her daugh- 
ters and to her sons not only the uncorrupted faith she had re- 
ceived, but also a lively appreciation of the value of good works 
and the importance of cultivating those mental habits by which 
these might be rendered more efficient. 
It is as home-keepers and home-makers that the Colonial dame 
and the Revolutionary matron are ethically significant. The 
civilization of the times centers about them as the typical dwell- 
ing of the period is built around the hearthstone. As the fire 
on the hearth warmed and comforted the dwellers in the home 
and sent forth its beams to brighten the wayfarer’s road, so did 
the character of the mother in the family influence her children 
by its beneficient gentleness, integrity and strength, and pour 
forth a kind, benevolent and wholesome radiance upon all sur- 
rounding life. Embalmed in the famous lyric the homes of 
early America have a world wide fame. The patience, fortitude 
and heroism of the women who made these homes “sweet”—all 
they are pictured, have been indelibly stamped on the charac- 
ter of our civilization and have endowed their descendants, of 
the generations succeeding, with habits of industry, skill in 
manipulation, fertilty in resources, and dexterity in execution, 
which has made for the material, social and moral uplift of the 
times they have served. 
In the early nineteenth century the altered conditions pro- 
duced by the diversification and development of manufactures, 
the influx of unskilled labor from Europe, the increase in 
wealth, and the growth and congestion of the population in 
cities, awakened in the women of the day desires and ambitions 
before unfelt. It seemed as if a voice spoke to them across the 
centuries, and with the tones of the Prophet of old cried: “Rise 
up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless daugh-

ters.” Standing at the doorway of the home the daughter saw 
many new and untried fields of usefulness opening before her. 
Her interests widened. The complexity of the life outside in- 
vaded her hitherto peaceful existence. She became dimly con- 
scious she was part of a large social whole, whose fortunes, bet- 
terment and destiny were, somehow, more or less intimately re- 
lated to the effort she herself might make. She found burdens 
in the home which she, even with her meagre equipment, might 
lift by earning an honest living elsewhere, and the labor was 
waiting for her hand. At first, timidly and reluctantly—some- 
times apologetically, did the girl begin these new occupations. 
Hampered by the influence of custom and tradition, her prog- 
ress was at first slow, but, little by little, gaining confidence as 
she moved onward, she found in her achievement a rich reward 
in independence. Accompishment strengthened the character 
rooted and grounded in the faith of her mother. 
Mere bread and butter occupations did not detain her long. 
This native born American girl of the early nineteenth century, 
“groping blindly for light,” “climbing to a soul,” felt within 
a spirit which called her to higher things. The academy gave 
her intellectual stimulus and, though to teach girls Latin was 
deemed the height of folly, some ambitious maidens were regis- 
tered in these classes and proved by their fidelity, their earnest- 
ness and their zeal, that the qualities of their nature had given 
them power here to achieve success. The intellectual horizon 
thus widened and enlightened could never again be clouded. 
It was bound to continue to expand until all knowledge was 
freely and clearly within the woman’s sphere. 
However confusing the debates concerning the higher educa- 
tion of women, the tendency to accord them this opportunity 
for development has been both natural and gradual. There was 
nothing really revolutionary in the idea of a college course for 
them, nor did it actually enter into our social existence as a 
strange or absurd phenomenon. The pioneers were possibly 
looked at a little askance, but not because they were taken from 
a select group of people. I have known some of them inti- 
mately the greater part of my life, and there has never been 
anything abnormal in their careers. They, each and all, are 
merely the result of tendencies which had been shaping their 
wholesome lives here in America for generations—tendencies

  which, as we have seen, have continually influenced our civiliza- 
tion for good; tendencies which made these young women sig- 
nificant exponents and exemplers of the true meaning of the 
college course for women and its appropriate ethical interpre- 
ters. Your own experience may also supply apt illustrations of 
my words. For myself, the careers of five of these early gradu- 
ates offer sufficient corrobration. 
Environment played its part in shaping their destinies. In 
the one case, the hereditary influence of the transcendental 
movement ; in another, fellowship in what is known as our Brah- 
min class. The home of a physician in a small country town 
gave to another the cultural surroundings requisite to awaken 
desire for study. The ambition of a God-fearing father and 
mother, and the innate desire to achieve self-improvement were 
all that distinguished the others from their school associates. 
The school course, which was the preparation for the college, 
was in each case marked by fidelity and industry. If these vir- 
tues are the qualities of genius, then these young women pos- 
sessed this excellence to a marked degree. But in no other re- 
spect did they evidence talent beyond their fellows, and they 
would be the last to claim for themselves extraordinary distinc- 
tion among their contemporaries. The honors which came to 
them were the result of hard work and earnest application. 
Whatever they possessed of individual predilection toward spe- 
cial fields of endeavor, was largely shaped by powers of circum- 
stance over which they had no control. 
The completion of the college course cannot testify to more 
than what the student herself carries in her inmost soul. In the 
words of a recent novelist: “Education can never change the 
quality of the stuff it handles. Sometimes it seems to act like 
an elaborate icing put on cheap cake. When you break beneath 
the surface you find a compound that surprises you by its 
poverty.” 
If for one of these women we are speaking of, the path of re- 
form and social amelioration opened on graduation for her to 
achieve a career tnexampled in her generation ; if the problems 
of college sanitation and government have been successfully 
solved by another; if a third was able to give a humble example 
of devotion to an invalid husband and was permitted to succeed 
him in his professional office; if a fourth has exemplified her
-P-A-G-E-111
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 111 
  own ideal of the true helpmate to the successor in her father’s 
practice; and if the fifth has shown by her fortitude, her cour- 
age, her strength, her determination, and, over and over again, 
has greeted the unseen with a cheer when the storm clouds low- 
ered and the bark of her life’s interests, with all that she held 
most precious, threatened to founder on unseen rocks and un- 
charted shoals—if these rewards have been secured to these 
women as the result merely of their college education, then 
should the doors of our colleges North and South be besieged 
by a constantly increasing multitude of maidens, clamoring for 
instruction to entitle them to bear away diplomas testifying to 
their ability likewise to win the battle of life. 
But the banner bearer is not always the conqueror. “Many,” 
says Plato, “are the wand bearers, but few are the mystics.” 
There are trite sayings to the effect that, “The diploma is no 
certificate of character.” To the five women I have mentioned, 
the college course merely offered the opportunity for perfecting 
their powers and of organizing their ability to accomplish the 
highest good, by leading them everywhere and at all times to 
perform the duty that lay nearest. 
This subject hardly has a place conspicuous in the curric- 
ulum. It certainly lacks the element of novelty. The legend of 
the aged monk disproves any attempt to foist it upon us as fad 
or frill to our course of study. Worshiped my the Stoics Duty, 
for the poet Wordsworth, was a stern daughter of the Voice of 
God. Yet even the monk found a reward in obeying her man- 
dates, and when he had accomplished his task at the gate of the 
convent returning to his cell saw again the vision of the 
splendor, 
“And a voice within his breast 
Whispered audible and clear 
As if to the outward ear, 
Do thy Duty, that is best, 
Leave unto the Lord the rest.” 
Respect for this fundamental quality of Christian ethics can- 
not primarily be inculeated during the four years in college. 
Nor would we claim that the earnestness, accuracy, unselfish- 
ness, candor, reverence for God’s laws and sturdiness through 
hardship, which have illuminated the later womanhood of these 
college women we speak of with a fresh and original beauty,
-P-A-G-E-112
112 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION, 
  were directly tracable to the pages of Greek poetry analyzed, 
the German verbs conjugated, nor the calculus differentiated. 
These were but the accidents of their careers. The habits of 
order, development of system, continuance of application, un- 
conquered enthusiasm, and conscientious faithfulness, which 
each now calls her servant, were posssessed and secured by a 
steady and wholesome condensation of tendencies, which have 
changed, matured and blossomed into characters intellectually, 
socially and personally righteous. 
The discontent which is now manifest with the plan of pre- 
paring students narrowly and exactly for after life should give 
us cause to consider if, in the preparation of these young women 
for their careers, much would have been gained with a more 
detailed attention to the special life work each was to have in 
her charge. If the scroll-of the future could for them have 
been unrolled, and the fruit of the accomplishment revealed to 
their eyes, would they have chosen to strengthen their reason 
and temper their wills by courses in journalism, in college ad- 
ministration in nursing, or in domestic science? Would ihe 
angelic light of their spirits have been more clear to warn, to 
comfort, and to command humanity, after a more. intensely 
specialized course during their college days? 
All will admit that the college course for women, as for men, 
cannot, while still remaining a college, employ the methods and 
fulfill the ideals of a technical school. Its chief function is by 
common definition to give a general education. Its aim is cul- 
ture. Culture, a much abused term, at one time synonymous 
with lost causes, forsaken beliefs, unpopular names, and im- 
possible loyalties; an adorable dream, a romantic vision, steeped 
in sentiment, and spreading its gardens to the moonlight and 
whispering from its towers the last enchantment of the Middle 
Age, as Matthew Arnold apostrophises Oxford University. It 
is supposed to be something apart from daily life. 
Perhaps the best description of this view of culture is the one 
illustrated in the story Robert Louis Stevenson tells of his ex- 
perience in the church tower. Whenhe left the public square the 
wind was so strong that the people were holding onto their hats 
and breasting hard against the breeze. In the course of his 
journey toilsomely upward, also along the dark winding stairs, 
he forgot the troubles of his own passage when he,was out
-P-A-G-E-113
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 413 
among men, and when he reached the narrow platform he en- 
tered into a full and selfish enjoyment of the quiet landscape 
stretching out before him. The gale was only in the lower 
strata of the air. Here on the height all was peace. He for- 
got that below were his fellowmen, with the wind buffeting and 
beating them about. Remote he contemplated the infinite 
alone. 
Culture has an element of remoteness in it. It takes us apart 
and above our fellowmen. It leads us out from the turmoil and 
the strife through dark and toilsome passages, up and onto 
pinnacles whence, in solitary contemplation, we view the blue 
sky above, the steep roofs around us, and far, far below the 
ant-like activities of the city streets. We no longer lean against 
the wind of learning, but stand erect and with full chests inhale 
the inspiring influence of its wholesome air. Our own person- 
alities expand. Our own powers are increased. Our selfish in- 
terests are perfected and we are, perhaps, led to feel that cul- 
ture has but little that is practical, and that anything practical 
has but little culture. 
Yet culture has also its practical side and is not wholly a 
thing apart from one’s fellows. Nor is it a thing to be annexed to 
oneself as our poor mistaken colored brother seems to imagine, 
when he buys organs which he cannot play, clocks which he does 
not know how to wind, and sewing machines which he cannot 
run, while he is still unacquainted with the use of our custo- 
mary table tools—knives and forks. Ye his experience is but 
an exaggerated instance of what many other people are guilty 
of when they suppose that culture is a thing apart from oneself, 
to be acquired by purchase in an academy of gilt unbelief and 
artificial letters—to hang in some conspicuous place, like the 
number on an automobile. 
Culture means something more than absurdity of manner and 
affected mode of speech. Its attainment involves more than the 
outward garb. Like the grief of Hamlet, it passes show. It is 
the total refining effect—intellectual, emotional and violitional, 
produced by insight into the meaning of what is learned. In- 
sight such as this these five women attained during their course 
in college. They have since proved by their lives and activities 
that for them, at least, culture is not wholly a thing apart from 
practical affairs.

  The Bab Ballads have rendered immortal two humble gentle- 
men who were cast upon a desert island after the founding of 
the good ship Ballyshannon. They were both engaged in trade, 
yet each observed the punctiliousness of etiquette even to the 
point of extreme personal inconvenience. One of them, you re- 
member, was a taster of tea; the other, from eastern shores, im- 
ported indigo. Now neither of them could have occupied his 
lucrative position with his firm if he had not been refined—in- 
fellectually, emotionally and volitionally, on this side of his 
nature and, by mastering the intricacies of his business have 
become in the one case sensitive to the most delicate odor, in the 
other conversant with all the grades, color and weight of the 
article of merchandise with which he dealt. Their culture was 
narrow, but it was thorough. In the case of these five college 
women the college course stood for thoroughness and scrupu- 
lous regard for detail. It was merely a reproduction, under 
slightly different conditions, of their grandmothers’ Colonial 
housekeeping. They knew nothing of the modern notion of 
“points” and “credits,” by which our college course has been 
standardized. A study was pursued by them for the knowledge 
to be gained from it. 
This old system of a college education has now given place to 
a new, which is still in the transitional and chaotic state. We 
today aim at the universal and fail in the particular. We have 
glorified and perfected a system (as the Hindoos, astonished at 
the performances of the English plow, gilded it, set it up and 
worshiped it), and have left the subject of it imperfect. The 
student is allowed to grasp at a large handful and but little or 
nothing remains in the hand. 
It has certainly become a serious question whether an ele- 
mentary knowledge of many things is worth as much as the 
mastery of one rugged art, which necessitates such a toughen- 
ing of the mental fibre as to enable the student to master the 
subject. Power balanced by character is the highest type of 
education. Life is a constant process—a process of continued 
analysis and synthesis. The soul may be a moving number, as 
the Pythagoreans alleged, but the abacus is too primitive a tool 
to serve as a measure of intellectual progress. The present ten- 
dency toward valuing the college work in points and credits has 
all the vices of the old “finishing school” and none of the excel-
-P-A-G-E-115
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 115 
  lencies of the apprentice system. Here, at least, the passing of 
the rudiments counts for progress toward the goal—the liberty 
to call oneself a master workman. The accumulator of “points” 
and “credits” uses them as does the card-sharper his chips, in, 
an illegtimate endeavor to break the bank of intellectual in- 
tegrity and lavish his ill-gotten gains on a deluded band of 
sycophants, who mistake the brass of cleverness for the pure 
gold of scholarship and worth. The “point” and “credit” sys- 
tem gives us superficially brilliant men and women. It has yet 
to prove its ability to provide earnest, conscientious, faithful 
workers, thoroughly prepared, as were these graduates of the 
elder day, rightly to estimate the value and the importance of 
all questions which vitally concern their temporal salvation. 
Culture is but the temporal aspect of that moral perfection 
which the word salvation covers. And the attainment of this, 
in the spiritual realm, we are told is accompanied with fear and 
trembling. It requires the utmost application of our moral 
and spiritual natures. It is a discipline—moral discipline. 
Culture comes also through discipline—mental discipline. Its 
quality depends upon the nature of the subject matter. Its 
quantity, upon the scope and intensity of the training. Was 
Thomas Stevenson, the builder of lighthouses, any less cultured 
than his famous son, the author? The scope and intensity of 
the training produces the cauliflower from the humble cabbage, 
which, as Mark Twain remarks, thereby receives a college edu- 
cation. The common resultant, in the case of the vegetable 
and the man, is a harmonious and vigorous personality. In the 
older day when these five women went to college, the course 
stood for intellectual honesty and hard work. Today, when thé 
demand for trained efficiency was never greater and the compe- 
tition was never more acute, the same lesson of thoroughness 
must be borne in mind by all students who look forward to ac- 
tive participation in that social machine we call civilization, 
and, as did those five graduates of thirty years ago, so should 
they prepare themselves that they may go forth well organized 
and harmonized to the present purpose of the world spirit. 
This, then, is the legacy of the college woman to the college 
girl—a legacy of duty done, of culture attained, of thorough- 
ness formed into a habit. This is the ethical significance of the 
college woman of the past as she hastakenher place in the civili-
-P-A-G-E-116
  116 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
zation of the present. She is found performing thoroughly and 
well all that she undertakes. Her culture is a living process 
of continued self-control, overcoming of evil and of strengthen- 
ing what is good. She is, what President, Butler says all edu- 
cated people should be, “those who can do what they ought to 
do when they ought to do it, whether they want to do it or not. 
Not with blatant boasting does she go about. The manifold 
activities of the college woman today in our social life and 
economy are largely performed in so quiet and unpretentious 
a manner as to pass unnoticed. A friend of mine encountered 
the objection that the college course for a girl unfitted her for 
participation in active life. The college woman was accused of 
being unsympathetic toward all movements of a philanthropic 
and socially advancing nature. The alumne list of a single 
college, with the casaul addition of such other names of women 
as were locally prominent in these affairs, demonstrated that, 
far from cherishing opposition to movements of this character, 
the college women today are leaders in all enterprises of pith 
and moment which aim truly and sincerely toward the uplift of 
humanity. 
You all will recall the story interestingly related by the mod- 
ern Swedish novelist of the rescue of a child by its mother, when 
it had fallen into the clutches of a lion that had escaped from 
captivity in the city of Florence. How the mother tracked the 
beast to the public square, where he lay keeping guard over his 
prey, and then gently and cautiously approached, meeting 
those big golden eyes, whose sparks seemed to dance in the cen- 
ter of a wild destructive light, with calm, sure, and overpower- 
ing look, until the beast turned his glance away; and then 
quickly, on her knees, she caught hold of the child from beneath 
the destructive paw, and with her head close to the lion’s mouth 
so she could feel his hot breath in her hair, she crept back again 
a few paces very slowly with the child in her hands. Then could 
she rise and hold him in her embrace as with silent steps glid- 
ing backward she fondled her treasure with trembling arms, 
feeling with lips and cheek if it were still safe and sound, while 
her eyes were still fixed on the luminous eyes of the monster. 
And proudly, though calm and with rather a disdainful smile, 
she walked down the road toward home. 
Her timid neighbors called to her from their bolted doors:
-P-A-G-E-117
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 117 
“Where have you been? Did you see him?” 
“Yes, she retorted; he had taken my child and I took him 
back from him. He is lying over there. Why do you creep in 
doors and are so scared when a woman has dared to go to 
him?” 
It seems as if the intelligent and orderly progress of the race 
upward and onward here in America, during the latter half of 
the nineteenth century, might, without too much stretch of the 
truth, be directly traced to the influence of the college women, 
and, as the household was kept in order by the Colonial dame, 
as the faith was preserved by the Revolutionary grandmother, 
so the ideals of right living, clear thinking, noble doing, for us 
as a people have been preserved, cherished and rendered practi- 
cal and vital by the dreams, the hopes, the illusions of the col- 
lege woman. 
College women of today, as was said of Evangeline of old, 
“Feeling is deep and still; and the word that floats on the surface 
Is as the tossing buoy, that betrays where the anchor is hidden, 
Therefore trust to thy heart and to what the world calls illusions.” 
remembering that what one generation hopes for the next 
achieves, and while all are striving, each in her own way, for 
“nobler modes of life, 
With sweeter manners, purer laws ;” 
the hopes, the aspirations, the victories of the future will be 
secured as you are true to the ideals of your common heritage, 
and are prepared in your turn to assume that ethical leadership 
your elder sisters, and your mothers, have so valiantly borne. 
(Great applause. ) 
Tue Cuair: Perhaps it would be unfair for me to say that 
I have saved the best speaker until the last, but I will say that 
I have saved one of the best. Dr. Edgar Odell Lovett, Presi- 
dent of the Rice Institute, Houston, Texas, will close this mag- 
nificent meeting, his subject being the same as has been treated 
of by the preceding speakers this evening. (Appaluse.) 
Dr. Lovnrr: (As a number of the audience rise to depart) 
I hope you will not all leave, ladies and gentlemen. (Laugh- 
ter.) In rising, fourth in line, to speak to a subject which has 
been so ably discussed by three of my colleagues on the program 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
118 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
tonight, I am reminded of a method which has arisen lately for 
determining, during the course of a trolley ride, the nationality 
of aman. The Englishman rises abruptly and rather brusquely 
and walks straight out of the car. The Irishman rises, looks 
around to see if he has left anything, and with less assurance 
leaves the car. The Scotchman gets up, looks around carefully 
to see whether anybody else left anything, and with some cau- 
tion leaves the car. (Laughter.) 
My father’s forebears were Scotch—but in despair I look 
around for anything my colleagues might have left unsaid on 
the subject of “The Education of the Southern Girl” before they 
left the program and your presence tonight. (Laughter and ap- 
plause.) 
However, I hasten to add that I have enjoyed with you Dr. 
Johnson’s pertinent plea for the practical in the education of 
the Southern girl. I have enjoyed with you President Hager- 
man’s eloquent plea for the spiritual education of both the 
young men and the young women; and I have enjoyed with you 
Dean Snow’s elaborate exposition of the evolution of the 
ethical education of the college woman in America. 
We have heard a good deal said tonight about education and 
its ends. It might be interesting in this connection to give the 
reply of a Yale student who, when summoned by the Dean and 
told that he had not been making a very good showing in his 
studies, was asked why in the world he came to college anyway. 
He replied, “For the life of me, I don’t know!’ (Laughter.) 
“Mother says it was to get ready to be President of the United 
States. Sister says it was to find a suitable chum for her to 
marry; Uncle Billy says it was evidently to sow my wild oats; 
while father has concluded that the main end was to wreck the 
family fortune.” (Laughter.) 
Milton says that he called a complete and generous education 
that which fits a man justly, skillfully and magnanimously to 
discharge all the offices, public and private, of peace and war. 
Another has said its aim is health of body, virtue and good man- 
ners. The common German saying in our own time is, that it 
is the harmonious development of all the powers. To Herbert 
Spencer, it was anything that makes for completeness of living. 
A distinguished pschychologist thinks it to be the realization in 
every individual of the ideal of man in and for himself. 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 119 
Education is a constant force of effort and environment 
which makes toward the ennobling and enriching of the human 
life. Its history has come to be the history of the progress of 
the human spirit. It is any movement making towards the 
chief end of man which is—if I may be pardoned for quoting 
a bit of Presbyterian doctrine on this platform—in the language 
of the document known in Scotland as the Shorter Catechism, 
“to glorify God and enjoy him forever.” 
These are beautiful generalizations, ladies and gentlemen, 
but they are too everlastingly general to be instrucuve. If edu- 
cation may be characterized by a single term, in England it is 
character ; on the continent it is culture; in America, its end is 
citizenship. Now the modern woman comes forward and de- 
mands all three, and I, for my part, am disposed to give her 
what she wants; for in my experience I have found that in the 
end she always gets what she wants! (Laughter and applause.) 
I thought seriously about this subject before I came here to- 
night. Entertaining and instructive as have been the expres- 
sions on this platform tonight, I have been in some agony as I 
found the things I had thought, one by one, being presented. 
But it has occurred to me, in this time of riotous high special- 
ization of modern knowledge and organization of modern life, 
when the leaders of thought and action are harking to the fun- 
damental things—not thinking too much of the process of the 
education of the Southern woman, but having in mind the prod- 
uct, which has been so handsomely and eloquently character- 
ized in the program tonight—I have thought that satisfactory 
system of education for women might be built around those 
homely and fundamental elements of character and conduct 
which we all associate with reading, ’riting, reckoning, and re- 
ligion, and I might press this a step further and add to this, 
race production and race preservation. 
Reading, which makes, in Bacon’s words, “a full man;” read- 
ing not only of one’s own mother tongue, but of at least one an- 
cient language for contact with the continuity of human 
thought and human endeavor, and one, at least, of the modern 
languages for increased contact with modern thought and prog- 
ress. 
I never think of reading that I do not recall a story which 
Professor told me at Prinecton. He had received a let-   
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  120 SOUTHERN HDUOCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
ter from a young lady, who stated that there had recently been 
organized in her town a Browning Club, of which she had been 
made secretary; that they were to meet a week hence, and they 
were then arranging a program in which she herself was to 
take part, and she respectfully asked him to recommend what 
she should read in order to get ready for this program. He re- 
plied: “Dear Madam: Yours received and contents carefully 
noted. Read Browning.” (Laughter.) 
I am not attempting to be facetious, and youare bearing with 
me patiently, but I have two or three more serious things to 
say before I leave this platform. 1 will tell you just one more 
story, however. When Prince of China was in this coun- 
try four years ago, a number of gentlemen in New York gave 
a dinner to him, which it was my good fortune to attend. One 
of my colleagues on the program helped to celebrate by way of 
some limericks—and I suppose limericks are respectable. He 
said:   
“There was a young Prince of Siam 
Spent his time reading Omar Kyam 
Said he, ‘Old Omar, 
You are my Homer!’ 
Said Omar Kyam, 
‘F-amit?.” 
(Applause and laughter.) 
Writing is a form of self-expression, self-realization, a means 
of rendering permanent fleeting experiences of the spirit. 
Reckoning is not merely the “rule of three.” Woman has 
been a long, long time coming into her own as a reasoning 
being. All the circumstances of her early evolution tended to 
develop her intuition and instinct and to retard the develop- 
ment in her of constructive and ready reasoning; but in our 
time she has vindicated her just claim as a reasoning being; 
though I am bound to admit that some of us men still have 
difficulty in recognizing her as a reasonable being, for whether 
she laughs or cries, our explanation is usually wrong. 
(Laughter. ) 
By reckoning, I mean the processes even of abstract mathe- 
matics, which furnish a foundation for those sciences—such as 
physics, chemistry and biology—which again have made pos- 
sible the domestic science and household arts; for I regard
-P-A-G-E-121
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 121 
them as the most significant signs of the times. We speak of 
efficiency and system, but do you know that the filing cabinet 
is now in the pantry and the card catalogue has reached the 
kitchen? (Applause.) 
Religion—certainly in its notions of Providence and of 
purity and purpose of life, it has ability to transform and 
transfigure the present into a future of promise through a 
ministry more ennobling and enspiriting than that of either 
prophet or priest. 
Now, I think, as we stand today with the experiences in 
the education of women behind us—and, by the way, ungra- 
cious as it may appear, I desire to take exception to a state- 
ment made here tonight. Women were not hoodwinked or 
tricked by the earliest education received in the universities 
of men. Women went after what they got. They went after 
the education that was given them, because they wanted to 
try themselves out with men. The first knocks at the doors 
of Cambridge and Oxford were made by women who wanted 
precisely the same courses which men took, and they have not 
gotten over it to this day. 
Progress woman has made in our time. Steadily she has 
come from pew to pulpit and platform. From sitting below 
the professor’s desk, she has come to be “professorin” in one 
of the most conservative of German universities; and the time 
is not far distant, I venture to say, though I am not a prophet 
nor the son of a prophet, when in our own country she is going 
to proceed from the voting booth to the councils of the state— 
(great applause)—though, for the life of me, I cannot under- 
stand why she should prefer the council chamber and the 
courts to the church and the cloister and the cradle. (Ap- 
plause.) 
I believe in according to womankind every opportunity to 
realize her every aspiration and ambition. (Applause.) It 
can be nothing short of injustice that mere accident of sex, 
mere accident of custom and convention should deprive her, 
as a sentient soul, of the fullest realization of the possibili- 
ties of that sentient soul. And I have yet to see where it has 
done harm; I have yet to see where knowledge has ever yet 
done harm to man or woman. 
As to the sort of education which should be provided for

women, we may repeat Plato’s question: “If we are not to 
give woman the same education as we give to men, what sort 
of education is to be provided for them?” It is a fact, ladies 
and gentlemen, whether we succeed in solving this educational 
problem for women or not, we have not yet succeeded in de- 
signing a system of education for them alone. I would see 
them accorded the same opportunities in letters, in science 
and in art. Why should they not, as feeling, thinking beings, 
enter with men into the spirit of the past? Why should they 
not with us follow the lead of the spirit of science as a re- 
vealer of the laws and a conqueror of the forces of nature? 
Why should they not with us follow the spirit of art as the 
sunshine and joy of life? Why should we not all, in the spirit 
of letters, in the spirit of science, and in the spirit of art, and 
in the spirit of that which the ancient seer called the spirit of 
wisdom, but which we in our day call the spirit of service, 
unite in achievement, by whatever educational program the 
experience of man can devise for each and all, of a complete- 
ness of life and a full growth of the human spirit? (Great 
applause.) 
Thereupon the President declared the meeting regularly 
adjourned.

TRAINING BOYS AND GIRLS FOR MORE EFFICIENT 
RURAL LIFE IN THE SOUTH. 
BH. 8S. RICHARDSON, BATON ROUGE, LA, 
Ladies and Gentlemen: 
I feel honored to represent at this meeting a man like Dr. 
Dodson, Dean of the College of Agriculture and Director of 
the Experiment ‘Station, Louisiana State University. I do 
not mean to take his place, but simply to occupy the time 
which has been allotted to him on the program. I was noti- 
fied of this pleasant duty only yesterday. I have not had 
time to prepare a paper, but I shall simply give my views as 
to the education of Southern boys and girls. I would like to 
say, by the way, that sometimes a set speech is not so good, 
perhaps, as one which comes right out of the heart, giving a 
man’s feelings and experiences. 
Because of my connection with my work at the head of the 
Agricultural Extension Department of the Louisiana State 
University, and my past work with the country boys and girls 
in the capacity of teacher and superintendent, it gives me
-P-A-G-E-124
124 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  great pleasure to have this opportunity of representing my 
State and talking to this magnificent body on this all-impor- 
tant subject. 
I wish to say in the beginning that I am a Southerner, born 
and raised in Louisiana. My father was a confederate sol- 
dier, wounded in the battle of Shiloh, and has not walked a 
step since that great battle without the aid of crutches. My 
mother is the daughter of a Confederate soldier. I married a 
girl whose ancestors for many generations were Southerners. 
My people probably suffered as much from the ravages and 
calamities of this war between the States as those of any man 
or woman in this audience. The slaves owned by my an- 
cestors were all freed. I am telling you these things be- 
cause I am going to say some things about the peculiar social 
conditions of the South, some things which I think I have a 
right to say, because of my Southern origin and Southern 
experiences. 
This Kentucky man with his excellent secretary is putting 
something into this association and is pushing it forward. 
(Applause.) You know, Kentuckians are men of big ideas 
(illustrating by story of Spanish War). We have one of these 
big men at the head of this organization and it is indeed tak- 
ing on new life. 
My subject is “Training Boys and Girls for More Efficient 
Rural Life in the South.” That word “efficient” is a very big 
word, and I would like to read a short passage which illus- 
trates my notion of what efficiency is: “We have a new word. 
This word is used in every sermon that is being preached, in 
almost every editorial and advertisement written.” 
When thinking men meet and mingle you will hear this 
word used over and over again; this is the word “Efficiency.” 
Aristotle and Plato separated over the relative value of poetry 
and philosophy. And while poetry and philosophy have not 
been discarded from our lives, they hold comparatively insig- 
nificant places. They are derivatives and not catagories. 
The big man now is the efficient man. 
The question today is not “What do you know?” but “What 
can you do?” 
Once all honors went to the destroyers and exploiters. The 
man who could kill was king by divine right. Now honors go 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 125 
  to efficiency. The efficient man is a creator and builder. To 
be efficient, not only must you make a living for yourself, but 
out of the surplus of your energy you must be able to do for 
others. 
The world is being made over, and man’s business is to work 
with Nature, to utilize forces and combine them in forms of 
utility and beauty. Philosophy means talking and thinking 
about things. Poetry means graceful, gracious, and beau- 
teous expressions of life. But it is not enough to be graceful, 
gracious and beautiful. We must be useful. This is the 
kernel of the new American Philosophy. 
Now, then, I want to say something of our unique social 
life in the South, which was created on account of slavery. 
These conditions have been handed down to our present-day 
generation. Under that regime we had the slaves to do our 
work. He was the man to draw the water, hew the wood 
and till the soil. Naturally, these things relieved us of much 
drudgery that the man who did not own slaves was compelled 
to do. This condition created what is known in the South 
as the “slaveholder” and “poor white trash.” When the slaves 
were freed and taken from us, the rich of the South were 
robbed of untold millions. Our inheritance from the system 
is the wrong attitude toward labor. It has possibly done 
more harm and has retarded the progress of the South more 
than any other one thing. We, the Southern people, say— 
I say it and you say it—labor is honorable. I say that I 
feel that the man who works with his hands should stand as 
well in society as the man who lives by his brains. But do 
you know, that way down in our make-up we do not believe it? 
We Southern people do not believe it. There is no use to 
make the assertion. We are not living it and all our social 
institutions plainly show our real belief: 
This “attitude” of ours has cost us thousands and thou- 
sands of dollars. This attitude has created among our South- 
ern people thousands and thousands of men and women who 
are not bread winners, but simply parasites. (Applause.) 
To illustrate: There is a certain town in Louisiana where 
there are about thirty grown men. I pass there frequently, 
and nine times out of ten at the railroad depot I have found 
twenty or thirty men—stout, stalwart, youthful fellows—sit-
-P-A-G-E-126
126 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
ting there, never doing a bit of work. These young men are 
not. afraid of work. They will play baseball the hottest day 
of the year, and are able in every sense of the word to make a 
good living. But in that community there lives a large num- 
ber of men who once owned slaves, or whose parents owned 
slaves, and the feeling is that it is not just right for these boys 
to work because their grandfathers were wealthy slave owners, 
and, of course, they have much “blue blood” in their veins. It 
would not look well for them to get out and labor with their 
hands. That feeling and attitude is the inheritance. 
My observation and experience has taught me that the 
Southern boy and girl does not mind work; it is not a ques- 
tion of what they can do, but a question of this handed-down 
attitude. (Applause.) 
Let us notice for a moment the result on the South’s finan- 
cial condition. If you will go to the tax roll of many of the 
counties of the South, you will find that our native-born 
Southerners do not own the great bulk of the property. On 
the other hand, you will find that in many instances the 
counties are owned largely by people who have come from 
other States. I have examined a number of parishes in my 
home State, and find that the newcomers and not-resident 
people own from one-half to as high as seventy-seven per cent 
of all the taxable property. This is indeed an alarming situ- 
ation and shows that something is radically wrong with the 
South’s economic conditions. 
I have been representing recently my home State at the 
Chicago Land Show, trying to get people to come down and 
occupy our Southern land. They are coming. We welcome 
them. We have already made great strides in the South, but 
it is just a beginning. Examine your assessment roll and 
see who is rebuilding this great Southland. Are we doing it? 
Statistics say, No. I am anxious for our own boys and girls. 
I feel that they should have at least stock in this great sunny 
land which was once ours. At present, according to figures 
just stated, our native-born people in many places own as lit- 
tle as twenty per cent of Southern values. We have too many 
men who spend their time talking about Southern chivalry and 
the South’s beautiful history. I love the Southern chivalry 
and agree with them that the South’s history is beautiful in- 
   
-P-A-G-E-127
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 127 
deed, but this old story does not regain for our posterity lost 
wealth. 
In order that our boys and girls shall become shareholders 
in this great awakening, it is absolutely necessary for them to 
learn that the South has been sleeping idly on a field of hid- 
den treasure, and that by intelligence, honest, well-directed 
labor, our boys and girls can regain the millions by right their 
own. (Applause.) 
I have been in the school work all my life. I have great re- 
spect for the public schools’ phenomenal achievement. I be- 
lieve that when our course of study is based on “Education 
for Efficiency” that our distorted social and economic condi- 
tions will be righted. It is right along this line that criticism 
comes in regard to our public schools. 
Now the boy is taught when he enters school, by teacher, 
mother and father, that he must go to school and get an educa- 
tion in order to get away from the South, to get away from 
the farm. They say to him, not in words, but in action, “Go 
to school so many months and you will be able to sell soda 
water in a drug store, or sell calico across the counter; you 
must go to school and make something of yourself!” (Laugh- 
ter.) 
Our boys and girls have not been told that right next to 
them just outside of the school door lies a great undeveloped 
country, and that with the proper knowledge of its great re- 
sources they could go out and become rich, or at least make 
useful citizens of themselves. (Applause.) 
They did not tell me when I was going to school that they 
wanted to get me away from home, but every lesson, every 
suggestion, tended that way. They did not tell me that in the 
forest surroundings were contained millions of dollars worth 
of timber. They did not tell me that in a few short years this 
forest would be manufactured into lumber and that Louisiana 
would be the leading State in lumber production. They did 
not tell me the soil was wonderfully rich; that it would give 
three or four crops a year, and under sunny Southern skies 
was the best place to live. I was not taught anything of this 
in school. Neither was I taught anything of the value of fine 
stock, how to distinguish between the dairy and beef types of 
cattle, how to raise an acre of corn, how to judge the values 
of things that I daily came in contact with.
-P-A-G-E-128
  128 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  We must change our attitude. Our boys and girls in the 
South must be taught practical values. I believe in a school 
system that teaches our boys and girls that our National Goy- 
ernment is the greatest of all governments; that our South- 
land is the best of all countries; that just outside the school 
building lies untold riches which, with foresight and industry, 
can be brought into use, and that to remain here and become 
intelligent, frugal citizens is wise and intelligent. 
My father and mother said when they sent me to school that 
they wanted me to “make something” of myself. What was 
that something? “That something” was the school’s ideal. To 
reach this goal, this social ideal, the schools insisted that we 
study everything that was not directed toward skilled and in- 
telligent labor. To “make something” was to study abstrac- 
tion and get away from those things that we were accustomed 
to on the farm. 
Let us notice some of the results. Fifteen or sixteen years 
ago there came to Louisiana a well-dressed business man, who 
said to Mr. Jones, a small farmer, who had several hundred 
acres of timber, “You have got some old trees here which look 
pretty fair; I will give you a dollar an acre for them if you 
do not say anything about it.’ Mr. Jones, who had not been 
taught the value of timber, said to the intelligent, value-seeing 
stranger, “You don’t mean that you will give me a dollar an 
acre for the timber which I have been praying would be blown 
off!” “T mean it,” said the man trained in values, and on the 
next day they went to the parish seat and had the deed made. 
This and similar instances happened all over the timber belt 
of our Great State. I ask again, what has been the result? 
The timber now does not belong to the citizens of the coun- 
try, but to people who have come from abroad, and non-resi- 
dents. I say again, we are not teaching the proper thing in 
our schools. If Mr. Jones and the thousands of other South- 
ern men had been taught properly, they would not have sold 
these great forests for almost a song. (Applause.) 
But you will say I need not talk about this now, that the 
forests are all gone. Our rich lands are going just as fast and 
just the same way. 
I was surprised while in the city of Chicago to find such a 
large number of dissatisfied persons, who told me that they
-P-A-G-E-129
  JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGS. 129 
were tired of the cold, severe climate there; that they were 
coming to live beneath our own sunny skies, coming South. 
I say, we Southern people ought to be able to trade with these 
newcomers intelligently. We ought to know the value of 
land, timber and live stock. Our farmer knows how to grow 
cane, cotton and other things, but he does not know how to 
market it. He does not understand the law of codperation. 
Our education should give him a codperative training and 
commercial knowledge, that would enable him to dispose of 
what he has for the very best price. I would not destroy or 
take from the course of study everything that has been taught 
in former years, but I would place in it those things which 
teach the value of our resources. It is not a question whether 
we ought to do it, but we must do it in self-defense. (Ap- 
plause). If this is not done, our boys and girls must neces- 
sarily become laborers for the men who are coming into this 
country. Do not misunderstand me; we are glad to see them 
come, we welcome them to our country, we need them, but 
let our own boys and our own girls become shareholders in 
this great development of our land. (Applause.) 
As stated before, we have made wonderful development in 
the South in the last few years, but not so much as there 
will be. The only way to get ready for this development is 
to teach the youth what we have. We are beginning the 
great work. A train of eleven cars, containing products of 
our native soil, furnished by the railroads, will make a trip 
all over our State, beginning March 4, 1912, to show Louisi- 
ana to Louisianans. 
Long years ago, when the South first organized its first uni- 
versities, they were built and maintained for the select few. 
In these great universities were employed professors with a 
wonderful knowledge of the subject they were to teach. I 
wish to say for them, that they worked in the spirit of the 
scientist and made some wonderful discoveries. What was 
done with these discoveries? They were recorded in a great 
book and filed away in the laboratory or library of the uni- 
versity. Who received the benefit of these great discoveries? 
No one except the professor who came after, and a few fortu- 
nate young men who were able to afford the higher education. 
The universities have had thousands of students, but these 
9
-P-A-G-E-130
130 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
represented but a very small portion of the thousands and 
thousands of bright boys and girls who never had an oppor- 
tunity of darkening their doors. This state of affairs has 
gone on and on and the universities have not reached the 
great mass of the people. The modern university is chang- 
ing this. It has an extension department to carry those 
things which are being worked out there by the different de- 
partments into the home, into the field, into the schools all 
over the State. Instead of the few thousands in the univer- 
sities, as has been the custom for years, we shall have in the 
near future every man, woman and child of a whole State en- 
rolled among the student body and receiving benefit from it. 
To illustrate: Take the case of an experiment recently 
worked out by an expert chemist in our own university, in 
the department of animal husbandry. This professor is try- 
ing out some molded corn on an old horse to learn its effect. 
Will the result of that test be filed away where it will be of 
benefit to no one and forgotten? No; it will be published in 
a bulletin, turned over to the Department of Agricultural 
Extension, carried directly to the farmer at his home. (Ap- 
plause.) 
Not only are hundreds of these experiments being made 
by the university, but our National Government is aiding 
and assisting in this great work. The results of these great 
experiments are carried to the people all over the country 
through the demonstration agents and the Department of 
Agricultural Extension. 
Take the work of the boys’ corn club of my own State as 
an example of what may be accomplished. Through the in- 
fluence of these clubs and the demonstration work among 
the farmers, the yield of corn in Louisiana has been increased 
from eighteen million to fifty-eight million bushels during 
the last decade. We did not know that we could raise corn 
in Louisiana. Through the work of our boys this was dis- 
covered. Let us see what was accomplished last year. 
Twenty-eight boys made more than 100 bushels per acre last 
year; two hundred and fifty-six boys averaged sixty-one bush- 
els per acre. One boy this year made 150 bushels to an acre. 
Our exhibit made at the State Fair was so striking that the 
commission appointed by the Governor insisted that it go 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 131 
to Chicago to show to those people what our Southern boys 
and girls are doing. I wish to say just here that it attracted 
more attention than any other part of the exhibit. The North- 
ern men, like ourselves, did not know that corn could be 
grown so successfully in Louisiana. 
The excellent showing made by our boys and girls in club 
work has taken deep root in the minds of their fathers and 
mothers. I will give you a little incident of the far-reaching 
effect of this work. Only a year ago a man came into my 
office, an old friend, a farmer. He had rather opposed his 
boy taking up the corn club work, being rather “agin the gov- 
ernment,” as some of our people are. He opened conversa- 
tion by saying, “I let my boy go into the corn club last year.” 
I said, “Yes,” encouragingly, for I saw he had something 
that he wanted to say. 
“T planted an acre along side his. My boy used the govern- 
ment method and I used my own.” 
I asked him how he came out. 
He said, “I didn’t come out much. He made sixty bushels 
to the acre.” 
“How much did you make?” I inquired. 
“IT made ten,” he said; but added, “He beat me, but I’ll be 
doggoned if he will do it again!’ (Laughter and applause.) 
This farmer was taught something of value to him through 
the work of the university, National Government and his boy. 
We are not only doing work among the boys, but among 
the girls, also. There has been a feeling in the Southland 
that girls ought not to made to work. In my experience I 
have seen conditions in some homes in our Southland which 
are very sad indeed, due to the attitude we have maintained 
on this question. I am sorry to say that some of our girls 
are taught that they must not work, but they must keep their 
hands soft, for piano playing. 
(The speaker told two stories illustrating the lack of culi 
nary training among Southern girls and embarrassing results 
which followed.) 
To illustrate my point, I will take you to the home of some 
of the best people in Louisiana, and possibly Texas. If we 
should knock on the door and find the daughter within, play- 
ing the piano, she would walk out to the gallery, bow grace-   
 
-P-A-G-E-132
182 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  fully, invite us into the parlor, and there sit and converse 
with us on anything but a practical subject. Suppose on an- 
other day we were to go to this same home. Suppose on that 
day the daughter was trying to cook a meal, for which she 
has had no training. We might knock at this door until our 
knuckles were sore, the girls would not be at home. Is the 
girl to blame? No; our Southern girls and boys are willing 
enough to work with their hands, but again that old attitude, 
which has been created, predominates, and for our own good 
must be overcome. 
Possibly in men and women who have passed the age of 
thirty, the old ideal will obtain, but our children can be given 
a different standard. I believe our public schools should have 
on one side of the school building the class in home economics 
and domestic science, which should have for its teacher one 
of the most beautiful and talented young ladies in the whole 
country; and on the other side of this school building should 
be a gifted lady teaching music, as beautiful, if you will, and 
I believe the daughter of the banker, the daughter of the doc- 
tor, the daughter of the farmer, and the daughter of the black- 
smith should go from lessons given in domestic science and 
home economics, the art of home-making, thence to the class 
in music. Such a condition would at once place labor on a 
high plane, and eradicate from the mind of these girls the 
traditional attitude. I would have a school of agriculture 
for boys, in charge of one of the best and strongest teachers 
of the faculty. I would have the sons of lawyers and farmers 
work in the field under the direction of this agricultural ex- 
pert, as well.as sit together in the class room of the classics. 
We have our boys and girls’ hog club, and I have seen girls 
take premiums on hogs they had raised and tended them- 
selves. This is indeed the new education. 
I want to give you an example of one thing that happened 
in the northern part of Louisiana. There is an old com- 
munity situated about eight miles out from the railroad which 
had produced, before the war, many great and cultured men 
and women. Since that time, however, the community had 
gone down, the paint had faded from the houses, the lawns 
were unkept, the signs of affluence were gone. They were 
simply living on things that had passed. Their talk was of
-P-A-G-E-133
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 133 
  things “before the war.” They often spoke of great deeds 
they had accomplished. Two years ago an agricultural 
school was started in that community and at the head was 
an expert agriculturist, a real live wire. He organized a 
girls’ and boys’ hog club, and I was called on to witness the 
school exhibit. At this exhibit the boys had there fifty-five 
registered high class Duroc Jersey, Poland China and Berk- 
shire hogs. These people came out and witnessed this boys’ 
hog show. They felt again that the South was being rebuilt. 
These boys carried their hogs to the parish fair and won 
every premium, and, too, they had seventy-five per cent of the 
hogs exhibited. The best of these were sent to the State 
Fair and there received several premiums. This work teaches 
a boy or girl how to properly feed a hog in accordance with 
a very best method. He learns what a balanced ration means; 
he gets in touch with the chemist of the university. He notes 
the gains made each day; and figures out the net profit and 
learns practical lessons in a systematic way. Such boys and 
girls as these will rebuild our Southland. (Applause.) 
To show you something of the attitude against this work by 
some people, I will relate an incident which occurred at this 
exhibit of fine hogs. There was one very fine specimen weigh- 
ing something like four hundred pounds. A progressive — 
farmer was looking at it in wonder and amazement and 
finally turned to another farmer, who was not in accord with 
this work, and said, “I would like to get some of that stock.” 
The non-progressive farmer shook his head and said, “Them 
hogs have been powerfully pampered; I don’t want none of 
sich hogs.” (Laughter.) 
Let us train our boys and girls to do things; let us teach 
them that their community is the best on earth, and that right 
where they are lie great opportunities. Teach them those 
things that are most valuable, so that they may become fac- 
tors in the great uplift of our splendid Southland. Let us 
as teachers encourage this new education. Let us preserve 
our beautiful stories and our South’s chivalry, but at the 
same time instill into the minds of the boys and girls that 
life is what they make it, and the vital question to them is: 
It is not what you know, but what can you do? 
Let us teach those valuable things that touches our lives 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
184 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  nine-tenths of the time. A school system or college that neg- 
lects this is not fulfilling its whole duty. These things must 
be done as a matter of our Southern preservation. Our eco- 
nomic condition today is the result of lack of training, the 
outcome of a mistaken ideal. (Prolonged applause.) 
Tue Cuair: This is an evidence that our Association is 
growing in interest and instructiveness. This is but the be 
ginning. To night we will have one of the biggest meetings of 
the Association; tomorrow it will be a little better, and to- 
morrow night it will go out in a blaze of glory. We want a 
great audience tomorrow night, and tomorrow night there 
should be an overflow. So please circulate the good news and 
tell all your friends what great speakers we are going to have 
from now on. I can assure you there will not be a dissap- 
pointment during the meeting. ‘ 
We will now have an address by Hon. M. L. Brittain, State 
Superintendent of Schools of Georgia, on “The Education of 
the Farmer’s Child.” (Applause.) 
THE EDUCATION OF THE FARMER’S CHILD. 
HON. M. L. BRITTAIN, ATLANTA, GA. 
Not long ago there was a pitiful scene in the courthouse of 
one of our Southern towns. The defendant, hardly more than 
a youth, was on trial for having killed a man. It was plainly 
evident that he was unschooled and untrained in almost every 
way—one of those unfortunates to whom, with an uncon- 
scious irony, the term “hand” is so frequently applied, as 
though it were the chief or only part of him of any conse- 
quence. The jury had brought in the verdict of guilty and the 
prisoner was ordered to stand up and say why the death sen- 
tence should not be pronounced. He shambled forward from 
his chair and stood with almost vacant expression as he 
stared at the court. Just at this moment, before the judge 
could utter the stern words of doom, a poor old woman arose ' 
from an obscure corner. She was dressed in homespun, and 
taking off the faded bonnet which had concealed the thin, 
wrinkled face, her strained voice shrilled across the room in 
pitiful tone: “O, Judge, don’t be too hard on my poor boy.

  He ain’t never had no chance, Judge; he ain’t never had no 
chance.” It was a sad occasion, and the truth of the poor 
mother’s words so clearly written in the countenance of her 
illiterate son made it more mournful. He had no school ad- 
vantages himself, and twenty out of every hundred men— 
white men—in his county, which is devoted almost exclusively 
to farming interests, are likewise reported by the census as 
being unable to read and write. While this condition is much 
below the normal, yet we all know, or at least could learn 
upon slight investigation, that our efforts to banish illiteracy 
and to educate our children have been far more in evidence 
in the city and town than in behalf of this great class of our 
people. 
Four-fifths of the population of the South are engaged in 
the business of agriculture, and practically all of us are both 
directly and indirectly concerned with the welfare and suc. 
cess of the farmer as with no other individual in the land. 
When his fields fail to yield their return, whether blasted by 
drouth, devoured by insect enemies, or lessened by lack of 
proper culture, our mills stand idle, our merchants lose trade, 
and the disastrous effect is felt throughout every walk of life. 
Since every thinking man must realize this truth, it would 
seem that at least equal advantage would be provided for the 
training of this large proportion of our people on whose 
efforts so much of our prosperity and comfort depend. And 
yet confessedly, from both State and National Departments 
of Education, the figures show that the farmer’s child re- 
ceives less attention and less money to prepare himself for 
life and business than any other. The school to which he goes 
in point of appearance, equipment, teaching and value, as a 
rule, suffers painfully by comparison with the palatial struc- 
trues provided in urban localities. To his educational home 
alone in our day do the words of the poet, in most instances, 
apply: 
“Still sits the schoolhouse by the road, 
A ragged beggar sunning.” 
His playmate in city and town, through large appropria- 
tions, the issuance of bonds, or other means made possible by 
the concentration of wealth, has no personal knowledge of 
Whittier’s pathetic picture.

  The important part which the little district school— 
whether brown, red, or simply weather-beaten—has played in 
the development of our country should not be overlooked. 
Its economy, simple organization and even its provincialism, 
have been of immense value and have given it a worthy place 
in our history. The work it has done, the men and women 
it has trained, speak for themselves with an eloquence which 
can be silenced by no contemptuous tongue. There will, at 
least for many years to come, in a large part of this country, 
exist conditions requiring the little one-room school, and this 
fact should cause us to see that it is better enabled to meet 
the demands caused by the complexities of modern life. Per- 
haps the chief cause of its failure to maintain its past excel- 
lence is due to the fact that greater opportunities in other 
lines of endeavor have stripped it of the splendid young men 
—teachers who were its glory sixty years ago. To take thei- 
places we have young women, who have been earnest for the 
most part, but lacking in intellectual strength, and too often 
with their faces turned citywards instead of being in harmony 
and sympathy with the life about them. In addition to the 
loss caused by this uneven exchange, more topics are today 
in the course of study, presenting still greater difficulties for 
the teachers than in former years. 
These changed conditions and the importance of the sub- 
ject naturally cause the inquiry as to whether or not the old 
order of things, however dear, should not be displaced, or at 
least modified. In the progress of civilization improvements 
have been made and evolution has occurred in other depart- 
ments of human endeavor, and it is but natural that the same 
thing should be expected in rural education. Upon some of 
us the thought has been growing into a conviction that salva- 
tion and regeneration in this great field must come through 
two things, namely, the Consolidated School and a Redirected 
Course of Study. 
CONSOLIDATION. 
It ought to be clear that if we are ever again to attract and 
retain the strongest men in the work of rural education, the 
unit of organization must be larger in order to pay better 
salaries. Seeing plainly the farcical work which almost neces- 
sarily results from the effort to teach forty classes a day,
-P-A-G-E-137
JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 137 
  and to give expert instruction in primary grades as well as 
in the upper classes, the highest type of teacher is repelled 
by the almost hopeless task, as well as the small salary. In 
such teaching or “near” teaching there can be none of that 
division of labor so necessary for expert efficiency. While in 
city and town schools, departmental work is more and more 
stressed to develop skill and specialized effort, the farmer, 
in many localities, seems bent upon increasing the number 
of schools, desiring apparently to multiply the miserable lit- 
tle “shoe-box” structures near his door, rather than to have 
real educational institutions further away. 
According to Mr. Hays, of the United States Department 
of Agriculture—and I desire here to acknowledge the aid 
and inspiration received from his address on “Country Life 
Education”—there are three hundred thousand of these little 
rural schools in our country, and two hundred thousand are 
so situated as to be easily susceptible of being combined into 
one-seventh of that number of centralized and consolidated 
schools. In six hundred instances in a dozen different States 
the experiment has already been successfully made without 
a single recorded failure. Some of the more notable of these 
were visited by the Southern State Superintendents of Edu- 
cation one year ago. In several instances the thirty or forty 
little schools of a county have been combined into a half 
dozen six and eight-room buildings, as complete in equip- 
ment and as effective in work as could be found in any popu- 
lous urban center. 
Under such conditions there are, besides the school spirit 
and civic pride engendered, numerous advantages. In the 
first place there is the comfort and safety of the child. In- 
stead of the lonely walk, the new order requires transporta- 
tion of the pupils. School wagons are used, and without 
burdensome expense the happy, living freight, warm and dry, 
is delivered each morning at the school door. In the South 
in particular, with the ever-present dread of the negro vag- 
rant, is this of value, for it would remove the pallor from 
many a mother’s cheek, now never relaxed from the strain 
until she hears the welcome sound of her daughter’s step re- 
turning unharméd to the parental hearth-stone. These two 
considerations of health and safety ought to be sufficient to 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
138 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  win the support of every father on the farm to substitute 
the consolidated school, with its natural accompaniment of 
transportation, in place of the small district unit, with its 
disagreeable and oftentimes dangerous walk. If it be urged 
that these things cannot be brought about by reason of the 
increased cost, the answer is two-fold: First, in many in 
stances the expense need be little if any greater; and second, 
even if this should require more money, let it do so. Double 
or treble the per capita now applied to the education of the 
average farmer’s child in the South, and it will still fall far 
short of that expended upon the more fortunately situated, 
but no more deserving, city pupil. 
As already indicated, the consolidated school meets the de- 
mand of the age for specialists in primary, intermediate, high 
school and supervisory work. There is a blind call from 
many country localities for secondary instruction, which 
grows more insistent each year. They know something is 
wrong, but, not reasoning clearly, think in most instances 
that their children will be given what is lacking if only they 
can have high school studies added in the little one-room 
schools already doomed to inefficiency by reason of their 
many grades. Besides meeting this very justifiable demand 
in the centralized school, the division of the work suggests 
the value of the codperative principle among those of our 
people who most of all need this lesson. In some instances 
it has brought about local creameries, canneries, fairs, and in 
other ways has shown the financial value of community spirit, 
as contrasted with the primitive plan with its selfishness and 
waste, where every man works for himself alone. 
There are many other advantages in consolidation, but to 
enumerate them would take more time than I have at my dis- 
posal on this occasion. Much could be said in favor of the 
value of such a public institution as a center of civic interest 
for lectures, concerts and public assemblages of all kinds. A 
half dozen in every county, if properly managed, would be 
productive of more reputation and real educational work than 
any number of the poor little schools now so much in evi- 
dence. This one change would mark a long step forward 
in the direction of giving a better chance to the child of the 
farmer.
-P-A-G-E-139

REDIRECTED EDUCATION. 
But the second need is likewise vital. Our schools, and in 
particular our rural schools, need to be more closely in con- 
tact with the life for which they prepare. In most cases they 
represent but pale and feeble imitations of city education, 
itself too often worshipping forms and words instead of the 
real things of life. Prior to the last few years there was very 
little available knowledge collected in text-books concerning 
agriculture and nature study. Recently, however, the re- 
searches of Luther Burbank, Bailey and the practical scien- 
tists connected with the Agricultural Department at Wash- 
ington, and others, have laid bare to our gaze a vast store- 
house of unexpected wealth ready for use. These wonderful 
discoveries in the field of nature are directly connected with 
the work of the farmer. Study and acquaintance with the 
principles already developed will result—have resulted in 
many instances—in multiplying the product of the farm many 
times. The question to be answered, then, is, shall all this be 
neglected and our schools, especially our rural schools, have 
none of the benefits of this inspiring material in their courses of 
study? 
Take the cotton plant as an example. On the successful 
outcome of its crop our prosperity and comfort largely de- 
pend. When it fails there is famine in the Southland. It 
covers our hills and plains with its mantle of white from 
Virginia to Texas. Upon its fleecy staple the world relies © 
mainly for clothing, and even in its seed-kernels there is 
stored a wealth vieing in richness with the olive orchards of 
Italy or the vine-clad hills of France. Men travel far merely 
to see this plant and yet, in spite of its beauty and impor- 
tance, it receives the silghtest of consideration at the hands 
of the Southern schoolmaster. Its family, friends and insect 
enemies are practically overlooked in the curricula of all ex- 
cept a few special agricultural institutions. In all of them 
it should receive attention, and it is almost ridiculous to have 
to argue that its culture and welfare should be in theory and 
practice a part of the course of study in every rural school. 
The same thing is true of corn, though this latter defect is 
being remedied by the inspiration of the corn club movement 
under the direction of the Department of Agirculture. 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  140 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Years ago Herbert Spencer, in “What Knowledge Is Most 
Worth While,” pointed out our weakness in giving the orna- 
mental precedence over the useful in things pertaining to the 
mind as well as the body. In a country like ours, where farm 
products form the basis of our prosperity and wealth, agricul- 
tural botany belongs, by right of common sense, in our school 
work. Nature study is confessedly of value everywhere, and 
with us it would be difficult to overrate its importance. And 
yet there is hardly a subject more likely to be omitted en- 
tirely from the course of study in the average school. It 
should receive the attention its worth demands, even at the 
hands of our urban teachers, for it was no meaningless myth 
told in the classic tale of the renewed strength and vigor 
which came to Antaeus from his contact with mother earth. 
Not a city child, boy or girl, but would be benefited and bet- 
ter prepared for life by substituting this training for some 
of the Greek and Roman history, language or mathematics, 
which now assume, at the dictation of our colleges, to be the 
only and divinely appointed means to secure an education. 
Pardon a personal word lest you imagine that I speak with 
some prejudice on this subject. My own training was largely 
of the old line, classical type, and yet there has not been a 
time for these ten years past when I would not have gladly 
surrendered a third of it in exchange for the nature study, 
practical botany and biology, so difficult to secure after the 
school years, which seem to me to be so essential for the edu- 
cation of Southern youth. 
MANUAL TRAINING—MIDDLE MAN, 
If it be urged that such a course is one-sided in that no 
provision is made for giving a similar practical tinge to the 
training of the farmer’s daughter, let me say that this also 
is emphatically meant. Sewing, cooking, the artistic and 
sensible care and decoration of a room, canning, all the arts 
which go with home-making, are needed to match the new 
work of the boys and to arouse the country school from the 
Rip Van Winkle sleep in which it too often lies dormant. 
The study and care of improve breeds of poultry are proper 
subjects for our schools, and under the guidance and direction 
of interested teachers the family income may be augmented,
-P-A-G-E-141
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 141 
the girls taught independence, and the price of eggs and 
chickens reduced until the rest of us, as well as the preachers, 
get a chance to eat them. They learn the meaning of a well- 
balanced food ration, and add to the mother’s training a prac- 
tical knowledge of the chemistry of foods. One little girl in 
a county of my own State, for instance, knows how to pre- 
pare corn in its various forms in sixty different ways for the 
family table. 
It is not contended or expected that these things can be 
put into our rural schools without perhaps additional ex- 
pense. Nor, as stated before, is this especially to be desired, 
since the farmer’s child now has less spent upon him than any 
other in the land. Give him the same chance and history 
shows that he will go further and do better, upon an average, 
than the city-reared boy. It is too much to expect, however, 
that he will be as well prepared for life upon a per capita 
of three or four dollars each year, as the urban child with an 
expenditure of from twelve to twenty dollars annually. It is 
paying him too high a compliment. Let us give him some- 
thing like an equal chance, however, and if the difficulties in 
the way seem great, let us strive the more to remove them. 
He deserves this consideration at our hands, for as a rule 
on the farm you will see the best type of American life and 
citizenship. Here you will not find the Slav. He is too busily 
engaged in peddling shoe laces until he has saved sufficiently 
to invest in a pawn shop or clothing store. Neither may you 
expect to see the Syrian or Italian. They must mind their 
fruit stands until they secure enough money to return to 
South Europe. The farm is controlled by the descendants of 
that same great race which has played such a mighty part on 
the world’s stage of action since they first appeared on Nor- 
man deck and Saxon field. The tow-headed, fair-skinned chil- 
dren of the American farmer as a rule go straight through 
the centuries from Yorktown to Senlac. They belong to the 
race which for a thousand years has held preéminence in his- 
tory; followed Richard the Lion Hearted in the Crusades ; stood 
with the barons who wrested Magna Charta and liberty from 
King John at Runnymeade; danced like bridegrooms at a 
marriage feast up the heights of Gettysburg; ever leading as 
inventors, statesmen and warriors, through race and heritage  
-P-A-G-E-142
142 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  they deserve well at our hands—as much in the remote dis- 
trict as in the crowded town. 
Perhaps the hardest part of the task will be to make the 
boy’s parent—the farmer himself—realize the necessity for 
the change and improvement. The most conservative of the 
conservatives, and nearly always predisposed to regard edu- 
cation as a tax instead of an investment, he is frequently the 
last to be convinced in a movement for the betterment of his 
educational facilities. This has discouraged many and caused 
good men to fear that the farmer’s indifference would lead 
with his consent to the toleration of an inferior or sort of 
peasant education in the remoter country districts. I need 
not say that every instinct of patriotism as well as prudence 
will forbid such a condition. These six millions of boys and 
girls in the rural schools form the very bone and sinew of the 
next generation, are its chief reliance for food and raiment, 
and deserve every opportunity possible for growth and de- 
velopment. 
If there were no other argument, selfish considerations 
alone should inspire us to render the conditions surrounding 
the country boy and girl as equitable and attractive as pos- 
sible. The rapid growth of urban life and the depopulation 
of our farms have been brought forcibly to our attention, not 
only by the figures of the Census Bureau, but by the increased 
cost of living as well. Nearly every boy attracted by the glare 
of the city becomes a consumer instead of a producer. The 
increase in the first class and the loss to the second naturally 
have an important effect on the cost of food and clothing. 
This injures all concerned, and yet the migration is unneces- 
sary and frequently undesired, even by those who make the 
change. If we had devoted some of the money we have been 
spending in training children for doctors, lawyers, teachers, 
preachers and merchants, towards giving instruction in agri- 
culture and its allied interests, it would be better for us all. 
The very subject in which we are most vitally concerned is 
a sort of Cinderella sitting disconsolate in the ashes, while 
her haughty city sisters flaunt their proud plumes through 
the culture courses of the average curriculum. 
Nor does this mean any lack of respect or consideration 
for the best that is in our old educational work. Some of it
-P-A-G-E-143

must give way to the insistence for modern needs and condi- 
tions, but much will remain as it has ever been—the glory 
of our schools, with its humanizing and refining influence 
upon the human mind. There is room, however, for the sensi- 
ble and practical as well as for the ideal and classic in the 
education of all our children. (Applause.) 
At this point Dr. Johnson, Chairman of the Committee on 
Resolutions, introduced the following resolution, explaining 
that it was necessary at this time in order that other action 
dependent upon it might be taken at the proper time: 
Resolwed, That the office of Treasurer is hereby abolished, and that 
wherever the word “treasurer” appears in the Constitution of the 
Southern Educational Association it shall be made to read “secretary- 
treasurer.” 
That section 2 of Article III be amended to conform with this 
action. 
  Dr. Johnson stated that the present Treasurer had served 
most faithfully, but that this action was suggested in order 
to curtail expense, which could be done to a large extent by 
consolidating the offices of Secretary and Treasurer. 
Dr. Johnson moved the adoption of the resolution, which, 
motion was seconded by Dr. Whitfield, and unanimously 
adopted. 
Professor Horn made announcement of arrangements for 
an excursion to Galveston on Saturday, returning in time for 
the evening meeting; and also extended, in behalf of the Y. M. 
C. A. of Houston, to the men of the convention, an invitation 
to make its building headquarters while in the city. Profes- 
sor Horn also extended, on behalf of the postmaster of the 
city, an invitation to everybody to visit the new Federal build- 
ing on the occasion of an opening reception to be held there 
this evening, following the regular evening session of the As- 
sociation. 
He also announced a demonstration of volley ball at the 
gymnasium of the High School at 1:30 o’clock this afternoon.

of the absence of the Secretary of Agriculture from Washing-

us in the person of Dick J. Crosby, of the Department of Agri- 
culture, who will ably fill Dr. Hayes’ place on the program.

COMMUNITY BUIDING. 
  D. J. CROSBY, WASHINGTON, D. C. 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
I can hardly undertake to do what your Chairman has said 
I would do, %. ¢., fill the place of the Honorable Assistant 
Secretary of Agriculture, and any of you who know the As- 
sistant Secretary of Agriculture will understand why I say 
this. I could neither do it in a physical way nor in an intel- 
lectual way. 
I have here a paper which has just come from the Assistant 
Secretary, but I will not undertake to spoil his paper by read- 
ing it without having first had a chance to glance over it. I 
will turn it over for publication, and, if I may, just say a 
word for myself with respect to the work of my department, 
supplementing what some of your speakers have said about 
education in the rural districts. I want to speak particu- 
larly, for a few minutes, to this point of community building. 
I do not want to draw any fanciful pictures, but will give 
you an account of some of the work which is being done by 
some of the rural schools of the country. I have in mind one 
little village and township school that was attended by about 
as many boys and girls from the country as there were boys 
and girls from the village. It was an ordinary high school, 
one of the old-time schools. They had a little science in the 
line of botany, chemistry, physics, etc., not amounting to 
much in the total. Finally, they employed an agricultural 
college graduate to teach science and agriculture. He reor- 
ganized the study of these sciences with direct reference to 
agriculture, and taught agriculture in the class room and 
laboratory. But particularly he taught the laboratory and 
community phases of this work. He used a microscope to
-P-A-G-E-145
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 145 
  study the plants of the farm, the things they were familiar 
with, and the boys and girls thus discovered some wonderful 
things right around them. 
One instance I might mention in connection with their 
microscopic work: One day a man in the village purchased 
some ground feed and suspected it was not all it was sup- 
posed to be. He sent a sample to the teacher and asked if he 
could tell what was in it. The teacher distributed the sam- 
ples among the pupils and they examined it. They found that 
it contained at least fifty per cent of ground corn cobs, and 
so reported to the dealer in feeds who had submitted the sam- 
ple. He sent the carload back and the community was saved 
the payment for half a car load of corn cobs. They also 
studied about animals, and did not confine their study to the 
text and the few pictures in the book. They went to adjacent 
farms, or had animals brought to the college for judging. 
The farmers brought there their best dairy and beef cattle, 
their fine driving horses, fine hogs, etc., to be used in this 
study, and some farmers also came and listened. When they 
studied beef animals, arrangements were made with the 
butcher of the town to give a demonstration on a beef animal. 
While the carcass was being cut up, the butcher told them 
why this particular cut was more valuable than another, and 
why it was important to have a beef animal that would lay 
on flesh in certain particular parts; also why it was impor- 
tant to have an animal for dairy purposes that would not use 
her feed in laying on flesh, but would utilize it for producing 
milk. 
Adjacent to another schoo} were big fruit orchards, which at 
one time had been very productive of fine apples, but which 
of late years had been growing principally cider apples. The 
orchards had been neglected and were covered with San Jose 
scale. This little agricultural school was organized and 
called a county high school, because county funds were used 
for its maintenance. They employed as teacher a young man 
from my office. They wanted to try the experiment of an 
agricultural school, and I was anxious:to help them make some 
experiments in connection with our work in the office of Ex- 
periment Stations with which I was connected. They did 
not feel that they could pay over six or seven hundred dol- 
10 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
146 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
  lars for a teacher; had no idea what it cost to get such a 
teacher. Finally I arranged for them to pay this man $800 
for eight months, and we employed him the rest of the year. 
One of the first things he did was to offer to test the seed 
corn for any of the farmers who would send samples. Fifteen 
to twenty-five sent in samples. It happened to be a year when 
the seed corn was particularly poor, and but a small per- 
centage of it grew. Many farmers were thus saved the culti- 
vation of large acreages of bare ground by thus learning which 
seed was good. One farmer did not believe in it and thought 
he could pick out his good seed corn by eye. So he tried an 
experiment of his own. He took fifty ears of the nicest corn 
he could find from a crib where it had been subjected to the 
cold, freezing weather, and fifty ears from some he had in a 
garret. He thought the corn from the crib was about as good 
as that from the garret. He looked at it and decided it was 
all right. He sent it to the school to be tested, neither teacher 
nor pupils knowing anything about the identity of the two 
lots. After the test they reported to the farmer that 33 per 
cent of the corn from the crib grew, and about 90 to 95 per 
cent of that from the garret grew. That convinced that 
farmer that they were doing something worth while to him. 
The teacher made arrangements with the owner of a neg- 
lected orchard not far from the school to give a demonstra- 
tion of spraying there. He made arrangements with the ento- 
mologist of the State to superintend the spraying and the 
boys did the work. The State entomologist talked to the boys 
and girls in the afternoon, and in the evening the farmers 
came to hear him talk about the San Jose scale. Next morn- 
ing they went into the orchard and prepared the spray, the 
lime-sulphur solution, going through every step of the prepa- 
ration and application in order to demonstrate it fully to 
those in attendance. The result has been, jumping over two 
or three years of time, that all the orchards around there 
were sprayed; while before that, in spite of the fact that the 
Experiment Station sent out bulletins telling of the need and 
advantages of spraying, how to prepare the mixture and apply 
it to the trees, none of the orchard owners were doing the 
work. But here was an occular demonstration, and when 
they saw at the end of the year the clean, thrifty condition 
of the trees, they were convinced and this led to action.
-P-A-G-E-147

That is what we must accomplish in this practical educa- 
tional work of ours, or we will not accomplish anything worth 
while. We must translate instruction into action upon the 
farm and in the home. 
The next year I wanted to take this man back into the 
office, but they wanted him in that school; and the result 
was that they paid him for that little school the next year 
sixteen hundred dollars, and I paid him four hundred dol- 
lars for the other four months in the office. They simply 
doubled his salary because they felt that the work he was 
doing was worth that to the farmers in the community, aside 
from the training he was giving the boys and girls. 
In an adjoining county is a consolidated high school. Mr. 
Brittain has visited this school. It is a good stone building, 
costing about twenty thousand dollars, with a splendid chem- 
ical and soil laboratory and good equipment for teaching 
dairying, and good equipment for teaching domestic science; 
in other words, a well-equipped, up-to-date high school out in 
the country. It has four wagons which bring the pupils from 
off the railroad, and the railroad brings others from north 
and south on its line. A graduate from Cornell University 
School of Agriculture is employed as principal of the school. 
He has taught the agriculture and science work; there is a 
good teacher of domestic science, a teacher of manual train- 
ing, and other teachers for the conventional subjects. 
I want to speak more particularly of the relation of this 
school to the community round about. This man came there 
with the idea that such a school thus planted out in the 
country should do work for four classes of people: the chil- 
dren of the school, regularly enrolled; young men and women 
too old to go to school; the farmers of the community, those 
who had been long out of school and engaged in the regular 
work of farming; and the farmers’ wives. 
He began by announcing a series of evening lectures for 
farmers, a ten-weeks’ winter course. Seventy or eighty 
farmers attended the first lecture, many of them out of curi- 
osity. Some of them told him in the beginning that ten was 
too many; that they might possibly attend five, but that they 
were not accustomed to that sort of thing and they did not 
think they could spend the time for ten. 
    
-P-A-G-E-148
148 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  The first lecture was on soils, soil fertilizers and soil man- 
agement. He made the lecture very simple, very plain, and 
had his apparatus, by means of which he performed little ex- 
periments. The attendance upon these lectures increased 
right from the start through the whole ten, until the average 
was 125 for the winter course, farmers who came from all 
parts of the district. 
A literary society and debating club was organized for the 
young men and women out of the school, and was well at- 
tended. For the farmers’ wives four short courses were organ- 
ized, held on Saturdays. The school wagons were sent out after 
noon on Saturday to bring the farmers’ wives to the school. 
First of all, there would be a lecture by some one outside of 
the community; then the women were separated into four sec- 
tions, each remaining with the same course throughout the 
year’s work. These covered cooking, art work—such as 
basket making, stenciling, etc—manual training, teaching the 
use of the saw, plane and hammer, and a modern literary 
course. These women came there week after week through- 
out the year—about eighty on the average, I think. 
Along in the spring they had a corn congress, a large meet- 
ing which brought the people together from all over the 
county. Special meetings of various kinds were also held for 
the entertainment and education of these people. 
The result was that the men and women of that community 
very soon came to consider that as their particular school, 
and they could not do enough to help out in the work. 
Another line of work was the home work, the summer work 
of the boys in the high school. The teacher thought it was 
not enough to teach the boys while in school, but that they 
should translate this work into the work of the farm at home. 
He required each boy to have a project to carry out at home— 
some with corn, some with alfalfa, some in dairying or other 
lines—each one working out some problem at home with the 
father’s permission and under the direction of the principal, 
who came back twice during vacation to see how they were 
progressing. That is similar to the boys’ corn club work, 
though more advanced. Their problem was starting with the 
seed and ending with the finished product, and reporting 
back to the school on the work at the end of the season.

The result of this was translated into community activity. 
This last summer the farmers wanted to go into this sort of 
thing, codperating with the school in carrying on some experi- 
ments; and that wish of theirs took the form of a demand 
upon the Experiment Station of the State to help out, so the 
station authorities hired a teacher to take his place in order 
that he might spend his time on the farm. In this way the 
farmers codperated in the working out of some of their own 
problems. 
These are some of the things I mean when I speak of the 
community work of public high schools. There are some in 
Texas working out some of these things in their own way. 
You ought to study about these things and understand them. 
We hope through the office of Experiment Stations to be able 
to describe this work to others throughout the country who 
are wishing and hoping for help along these lines. 
The work of our public schools must not only cover the old 
traditional subjects, which are good so far as they go, but 
must be made to contribute to the efficiency, as Mr. Richard- 
son has said, of the boys and girls who attend the school; 
must help make for progress and happiness on the farm, 
where there is so little now to cheer the people in their life 
work. When the schools are put on this basis we shall have 
a better and more efficient school system. _(Applause.) 
After again appealing to all in attendance to become mem- 
bers of the Association, and announcing the afternoon meet- 
ings, the Chair declared the session adjourned.

    THe Cuan: We have had a splendid meeting thus far, the 
best in the history of the Association. Texas has done well; 
Houston, nobly. We appreciate it, but we want these good 
things to continue through tomorrow night. Tomorrow’s 
program will be an excellent one. In the morning “Mountain 
Education will be discussed, something few of you are fa- 
milia with. You do not know the lamentable conditions which 
prevail in the mountain sections and the difficulties in the 
educational line. In order that you may feel for these 
neglected ones, and perhaps help to make their conditions 
better, we desire you should hear these discussions tomorrow. 
Mrs. Stewart, who is one of the principal speakers tomorrow, 
is a mountain superintendent as well as President of the 
Kentucky Educational Association, and I am exceedingly 
anxious that every educator here should hear what she is 
doing in the mountains. I am sure if you hear her and learn 
what she is doing under such trying circumstances, you will 
feel a deeper interest in your own work and be more deter- 
mined than ever to overcome your own seemingly insurmount- 
able difficulties. We want you to hear the splendid program 
for tomorrow morning and afternoon, and then we propose 
to go out in a blaze of glory tomorrow night. We hope your 
large auditorium will be filled to overflowing to hear Governor 
Folk and the other speaker on the program, Dr. Cope, who is 
equally as good. 
The subject of the education of the Southern Negro will be 
discussed tonight by gentlemen who have made careful study 
of the question. I trust you will listen carefully and pa- 
tiently to what they will say and that you will carry home 
with you the thoughts they will give; and that their expres- 
sions tonight will result in some concrete action on this great 
question that has long perplexed the South. I think I have 
made a wise choice in the selection of these speakers, and I 
am sure that when they have spoken you will agree with me 
that I have. I trust no one will leave this audience until the 
last word has been said. 
The first speaker of the evening is Hon. Clarence N. Ousley, 
President Fort Worth Record, Fort Worth, Texas. (Ap- 
planse. )

EDUCATION OF THE SOUTHERN NEGRO. 
C. N. OUSLEY, FORT WORTH, TEXAS. 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
I fell embarrassment of no small degree in addressing you 
at this hour, because, though I had ample notice for extensive 
preparation, I am the slave of. an imperious, whimsical and 
sometimes tyranical master—a daily newspaper that tries to 
render public service. As a consequence I have been sent 
hither and yon during these last few weeks, when I should 
have been reflecting upon the theme of this hour; hence I can 
bring you no well-ordered discourse fitting the dignity of 
this occasion and this distinguished audience. I beg you to 
accept my assurance, however, that what I have to say, ill- 
phrased and disjointed as it may be, expresses a deep convic- 
tion, and is no sudden or impulsive conclusion. I offer you 
this consolation, that whatever my address may lack will be 
abundantly supplied by the distinguished gentlemen who are 
to follow me. 
I beg you to accept my poor words, therefore, as a prelude 
to a symphony of high thinking and much learning. 
There are two facts with regard to the negro in the South 
which we may accept as established, open to no question, and 
not debatable within the realm of reason. One is, that the 
negro is here to stay. His nature, his more than two hundred 
years of training, and his affections fit him for this climate 
and the industries of this people. All schemes of separation 
or exportation are utterly fanciful. 
We may as well understand now as later that we are to 
abide with this race so long as God will let us live. We are 
called upon to perform the miracle of all human history, and 
that is for two peoples of superior and inferior qualities to 
dwell together without bondage, without destruction, without 
amalgamation.. Whether that task is laid upon us by a cruel 
fate or by wise Providence, whether it is a visitation for some 
error of ours, or is a selection of this people as the instru- 
ment of a mighty undertaking—whatever the circumstance, 
or philosophy, or history from the beginning until now, the 
fact remains that we are here, and they are here to remain.
-P-A-G-E-152
152 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  The second fact is that the negro will be educated. Having 
tasted of the cup of knowledge, he will not part it from his 
lips until he has drunk its contents to the utmost of his ca- 
pacity. If we will not educate him, he will educate himself; 
and his friends from other sections who do not know his needs 
and his nature as we know them will contribute to his up- 
lift, and contribute unwisely through their ignorance and 
their misguided zeal. 
Hence, it is no longer a question whether the negro will be 
educated, but it should become the question of how he will be 
educated and by whom. I have no sort of sympathy with 
that unstatesmanlike—I had almost said that inhuman—pro- 
posal, that education for any race or any class shall be meas- 
ured by the contribution of that class to the revenues of the 
government. Taxation for the education of the individual 
is justifiable only as a measure of protection to the State 
itself. The State has no right to take my property and yours 
to make the child of some other man more comfortable; but 
it has the right to tax our property or command our service 
or our lives to preserve the State itself; to conserve it as a 
political organization, to promote its prosperity in commerce 
and industry, and to maintain its sobriety and welfare by 
means of a moral and cultured development. Having this 
right, and no other right, it has not exercised that right nor 
discharged its plain duty until it extends its education for 
these public purposes to the least amongst us; and most impor- 
tant of all, it should bestow these blessings, for the public 
welfare, upon those most needing enlightenment and uplift. 
Consequently, there cannot be justice, nor philosophy, nor 
statesmanship in any division of public funds or any discrimi- 
nation in public service toward any class of citizens of any 
race or color. Nor is there sound educational philosophy nor 
sound social thinking in the proposal that education does not 
benefit the negro. Why, the very beasts of the field under 
education are tamed and made docile! No human intellect, 
no unit of intelligence, no class of society can be injured by 
education, if it be the right education. (Applause.) 
The fault with negro education heretofore has been that 
it has been directed along improper or impractical channels. 
The effort has been addressed to the superficial mentality of
-P-A-G-E-153
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 153 
the race, and in no wise, or only in small degree, has sought 
to broaden the intellect and awaken the comprehension of the 
negro to the problems of life. Indeed, we of the white race 
have not so much to boast in that respect. It is only in this 
generation that education in the South, and not more than two 
generations in any part of the United States, has been ad- 
dressed to making men more useful. 
We are just beginning to learn that during the period of 
youth men and women should be taught to make themselves 
valuable to society, valuable in industry, valuable in com- 
merce, valuable in agriculture, and valuable in all things 
which contribute to our material welfare, because our ma- 
terial welfare is the basis of social comfort and greater moral 
and intellectual development. 
Descending from these generalities to particular points, we 
must either direct our attention to the practical education of 
the negro, or we must leave him to his own untrustworthy and 
unsteady ambition for social and political accomplishments 
and association. He has heretofore looked upon education as 
a means of escaping from hard labor, and it has remained 
for one of his own race—one who is great by all the measure- 
ments of achievement and comprehension, one who is great, 
I say, by the standards of any race—it remained for Booker 
Washington, born a slave, to show his race, and in a large 
degree to show the superior race, what it means to society, 
what it means to the State as well as to the individual, to 
learn how to make a living in the simple way, how to dignify 
labor, and how to make men and women useful in their day 
and generation. (Applause.) 
It had not dawned on the negro race before to make them- 
selves useful and valuable in service. It had only entered 
their dull minds to escape hard labor, to escape the conditions 
in which they were reared, by occupying positions of ease and 
comparative idleness. Their whole ambition has been ad- 
dressed to the pulpit, the schoolroom, and political station; 
and unless we contribute to arresting that misdirection of 
negro effort, our social evils will be intensified. But if we 
address ourselves along the line which has been pointed out, 
then we may hope to serve this race as becomes the superiority 
which we boast. 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
154 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
    Let me remind you, too, when it comes to the question of 
support of the negro schools according to the ratio of their 
taxes, that in some parts of these Southern commonwealths 
we may find by analysis that the negro is not getting his 
share. There was a statement made by Superintendent Coon, 
of North Carolina, two years ago at the Conference for Educa- 
tion in the South which was somewhat fanciful, perhaps, but 
nevertheless which tends to show that in three States of the 
South the negro is actually, paying more taxes than he is re- 
ceiving in education. So, if you are going to reduce negro 
education to the basis of negro taxes, you may be required to 
give the negroes more than you are giving them now. But I 
dispute that artificial distinction as unstatesmanlike and un- 
fair. Public education can only be justified on the ground 
of the duty of the State to every citizen that constitutes a 
part of it. We are not discharging our responsibilities as 
the superior race, if we do not recognize our duty to better 
the condition of the inferior race. 
I have occasionally heard this extraordinary statement, 
that it might be unwise to educate the negro lest he become 
a competitor of the white man. Those who offer that silly 
reason pay a poor compliment to themselves. We started a 
million years ahead of the negro, and if we each maintain the 
same rate of progress we will be a million years ahead when 
he is where we are now. It insults our own faculty to inti- 
mate that we may endanger our prestige by doing justice to 
him. 
I beg to remind this Southern audience, also, that there is 
scarcely a man amongst us who is not in some wise the heir 
and beneficiary of negro toil. That race contributed to the 
early prosperity of this section. That people have been a 
part of all the material things that we have accomplished. 
Unwillingly, and yet cheerfully, through two hundred years 
they were bondsmen to your fathers and mine; and we owe 
them a debt of recognition, we owe them a debt of service 
which we were ungrateful and cowardly not to seek to dis- 
charge. 
The negro’s relation to the white race in social and political 
affairs-is an important consideration; but we have solved 
that, for we have demonstrated in these forty-odd years that
-P-A-G-E-155
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 155 
superior intelligence will, as it always has done, determine 
political affairs and direct the course of commonwealths and 
nations. We have demonstrated that by just measures, by 
lawful measures, and without violence, we may protect the 
integrity of the ballot box, and that we may confine it, as it 
must be confined in the perpetuity of a free government, to 
the intelligence of our citizenship. (Applause.) We have 
no longer anything to fear from those beneath us, and no 
longer anything to dread from those above us in political 
power, because all thinking men in this nation now recognize 
the monstrous blunder of negro enfranchisement and of po- 
litical: reconstruction. (Applause.) 
Those problems have passed, and these questions of educa- 
tion and contact in daily life need no longer disturb us as 
threatening the reign of intelligence in the Southern States. 
So we may, in all freedom, address ourselves to these problems. 
I perfectly understand the weaknesses of the negro race; 
I perfectly understand the horrors which have come of their 
atavism; I perfectly understand that by swift vengeance it 
has been necessary to hold in terror their blind brutes; but 
when I see in pulpits and in schoolrooms the well-meaning, 
trustworthy negro; when I see such men as E. L. Blackshear, 
of Prarie View, in this State; I. M. Terrell, of Fort Worth, 
and J. B. Rayner, of Calvert, and a score of others I might 
name—when I see these products of modern education in the 
negro race, I perfectly understand that that race is worthy 
of freedom and is fit for education. 
I am reminded also that in these forty-odd years that race 
of bondsmen has accumulated property estimated at from 
$500,000,000 to $1,000,000,000 of taxable value, and that means 
twice as much of real value. There are fifty or more well- 
conducted negro banks in the South; there are manufacturing 
institutions operated an financed wholly by negroes. 
' My countrymen, these people are capable of development, 
and we who boast a superior intellect reproach our superior- 
ity if we neglect to encourage that development in order to 
make better citizens, and in order to make them more useful 
for the industries of these Southern States. It is a great re- 
sponsibility; it is a great vexation; but we cannot escape 
it without being cowards, and we cannot neglect it without 
doing harm to our country. (Applause.)

He who contemplates any kind of social equality or social 
contact, is unlearned in history and stupid in philosophy; 
but he who cannot understand that side by side, day by day, 
with more or less friction, of course, but always with im- 
proved relations, that we who have reached these forty years 
together can march forty more or four hundred more with 
greater comfort, less understands history and is less lacking 
in philosophy. (Applause.) 
The President introduced the next speaker, Dr. James H. 
Dillard, President of Jeanes Foundation and General Agent 
of Slater Fund, New Orleans, La., who spoke as follows: 
NEGRO EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 
  DR. J. H. DILLARD, NEW ORLEANS, LA. 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
In any discussion regarding the negro in the South, whether 
of education or of economic conditions, or of race relation- 
ship, we need first of all to bring home to our minds a fact 
which we have often heard, but may not perhaps have fully 
realized. This fact is that the negroes are here in our midst, 
and that in the main they are sure to remain here, here in the 
South. We Southern white people should think deeply and 
soberly over the full significance of this fact. 
The census may show diminishing increase in the negro 
race, but this decrease of growth will be so slow, even should 
it continue, that it will not affect any present consideration 
of the question. The negroes may spread more and more 
through the Northern States, but this migration will con- 
tinue, as heretofore, to be confined almost exclusively to the 
negroes of towns and cities, and will not reach the masses of 
the rural districts. The various schemes of transportation to 
Africa, or to some one State, are utterly impracticable and 
have never appealed to thoughtful people as coming within 
the range of serious consideration. There is no avoidance of 
the fact that the negroes will continue here in the South as a 
large part of the population. 
History shows no other situation like ours. Other coun- 
tries, notably Spain, have faced the problems of unlike races
-P-A-G-E-157
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 157 
brought together under one government. But no nation, or 
section of a nation, has faced, as our Southern States must 
face, the juxtaposition, in a legally free condition, of races 
so unlike. The very peculiarity of the situation calls for the 
best that is in us. 
There is another fact which we have to realize, that as a 
rule the negroes are anxious for education and for an im- 
provement in their condition, and that very many of them 
have acquired a good education and considerable property. 
The amount of money which negroes have contributed during 
the past twenty-five years toward the establishment and sup- 
port of their churches and schools is most astounding. Sta- 
tistics are available, and if they mean anything, these statistics 
speak a wonderful progress. Now the white people of the 
South, to speak with the frankness which the case demands, 
can realize and deal with these facts—the presence of the 
negro, the desire of the negro to improve and the actual im- 
provement of many negroes—we can realize and deal with 
these facts with ill will and opposition, or, with good will and 
with such help and guidance as the conditions demand. 
My observation of the past three years leads me to the con- 
viction that the people of the South are now prepared to meet 
this question of race relationship in the spirit of fairness, 
and that we are seeking for information and methods that 
may lead to right conditions. 
We are becoming convinced that a degraded and ignorant 
class will be hurtful in every way—hurtful to health, hurtful 
to material progress, hurtful to every forward movement. I 
have found throughout the South that the efforts of negroes 
to better their school conditions have met with response from 
the best white people of the community. Such evidence has 
led me to think that Bishop Bratton of Mississippi is entirely 
right in saying in a recent article that the talk of ill feeling 
has been “to greatly exaggerated in the press and on plat- 
forms.” 
The improvement of the negro in morality, in reliability, in 
thrift, in sanitation, in intelligence, depends, as with others, 
upon the great forces of religion and education. We are not 
here to deal with the work of the churches, but with the prob- 
lems of education. Speaking of the educational sides, I should 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  158 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
like at this time to place all possible emphasis on one special 
thought which needs earnest attention. I am thinking of the 
masses of negroes in the open country. 
About four-fifths of the colored population of the Southern 
States still live in the rural districts, and I think no one, 
white or black, would gainsay the proposition that it is better 
that this distribution of population should continue. To my 
mind the question of most vital importance at this time for 
the prosperity and advancement of the rural South as well 
as for the general good of the negroes themselves in the im- 
provement of the masses in the rural districts. The only 
hope I see for the training of these masses into a more thrifty, 
intelligent and reliable character lies in the public schools, 
and our immediate duty to ourselves as well as to the negroes 
is to improve the public schools provided for them. Unless 
this is done the better class will inevitably move into the 
towns and cities in increasing numbers, and the larger class, 
remaining in the country, will become more and more de- 
graded and inefficient. We must lengthen the terms, im- 
prove the character of the schools, adjust the schools more to 
rural needs, and make them centers of neighborhood improve- 
ment. 
My present work in administering the Slater and Jeanes 
Funds is directed mainly to the improvement of these rural 
schools. The Slater Fund assists in the preparation of 
teachers, and the Jeanes Fund, through a method known as 
the Henrico plan, places in the hands of county superintend- 
ents the salary of a competent industrial teacher, who is to 
work in the small country schools of the country. This plan 
has met with much favor, and there are more applications for 
these supervising teachers than the fund can supply. It is 
well that such contributions can be used in this work. 
In conclusion, let me repeat that whenever the question 
comes, what is the practical duty that lies nearest, I see noth- 
ing so important as this simple problem of the country school 
which shall reach the largest numbers of those who most need 
enlightenment. We cannot endure to have in our midst a 
people untrained, unthrifty and ignorant. We must do our 
part for their uplift and betterment from every consideration 
of sanitary and economic conditions and in accordance with 
the obligations of religion and humanity.

The next speaker, Dr. J. H. Phillips, Superintendent of 
Schools, Birmingham, Alabama, was introduced and presented 
the following paper: 
THE EDUCATION OF THE SOUTHERN NEGRO. 
DR. J. H. PHILLIPS, BIRMINGHAM, ALA. 
I shall attempt in this paper to deal briefly only with a few 
of the immediately practical phases of the subject assigned to 
me. The historical and political factors which enter into the 
problem of negro education are too well known to require even 
a review; the psychological and sociological phases of the 
subject have also been amply discussed. Neither are we con- 
concerned here with the theories and speculations that have 
been so gratuitously offered for the ultimate solution of what 
is now regarded as the “Great American Problem.” 
What is the present status of negro education in the South, 
and what is the present duty of the intelligent white people 
of the South to the negro and to our civilization? If I merely 
attempt to answer these questions, I will have accomplished 
all that the time allotted me will permit. 
For more than forty years, it must be frankly admitted, 
the question of negro education has been seriously considered 
only by comparatively few people in the South. By the ma- 
jority it has been accepted as an unpleasant duty thrust upon 
them by conditions beyond their control. By many, it has 
been ignored, ridiculed or denounced, according to their inter- 
est, prejudice or temperament. In its earlier history it was 
treated as a sentimental rather than a practical question, and 
as such was relegated to the province of philanthropy. In the 
minds of too many people the noble word philanthropy be- 
came synonymous with sentimentalist, fanatic, and negro 
lover. Distrust and suspicion, always and everywhere, are 
deadly poisons in their effects, and the traditional story of 
the Greeks bearing gifts has its modern applications. The 
education of the negro was regarded simply as an effort to 
confer upon him, at the expense of the Southern white man, 
benefits he had neither earned nor deserved, and to elevate 
him to a station in life for which he was unfitted. Histor- 
ically, this attitude was but the natural and logical result of 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
160 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  causes which I need not here enumerate. The philanthropic 
motive as an incentive for negro education was ineffectual in 
the South. 
Nor was the civic motive, the preparation of the negro for 
the duties of citizenship, any more effective in its appeal to 
the masses. Indeed, the assumption that the negro, through 
education, should be elevated to a position of civil and politi- 
eal equality with the white man, at once complicated condi- 
tions and aroused bitter prejudice and antagonism. Political 
equality was promptly repudiated. The philantropic and 
civic aims alike, as incentives for the education of the race, 
made but futile appeals to the South. 
Gradually another motive has become manifest, and is the 
only motive likely to prove immediately effective—the appeal 
to the enlightened selfishness of the people, based upon their 
sense of right, justice and patriotism. Before the war the 
negro was recognized as an economic asset. Under the 
changed conditions of our modern civilization, the important 
task before us is in the training of the race so that its 
economic value to the State may once more be realized. The 
successful accomplishment of this task depends far more upon 
the Southern white man than upon the Southern negro. 
During the past few years the South has experienced a 
wonderful industrial awakening. With the building of rail- 
roads and cities, the development of commerce and manufac- 
ture, and the application of improved methods in agriculture, 
this new motive is beginning to operate as a powerful stimulus 
for the education of both races. The State is beginning to 
realize the fact that its material prosperity depends upon the 
productive power of the individual, and that its average pro- 
ductive power is in direct ratio to the average intelligence of 
its citizenship. While there is nothing new in this proposi- 
tion, the South has too long regarded it as an abstraction 
rather than a practical truth. Somehow we are learning the 
lesson that even in the cultivation of corn and cotton we must 
require more intelligence to increase the yield per acre; that 
ignorance does not increase capital or tax values, and never 
will. The State is finding that a considerable body of idle 
and unproductive citizens constitutes its most serious handi- 
cap, and society is learning that industrial efficiency is the
-P-A-G-E-161
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. : 161 
best remedy for the vices that infest our civilization. The 
economic motive appeals to the enlightened self-interest of the 
people, and as an efficient incentive promises large results in the 
education of the Southern negro. 
Among the economic problems of the South, the labor prob- 
lem today is perhaps the most acute. The extent to which 
this problem is affected by educational facilities is scarcely 
appreciated yet by our industrial leaders and political econo- 
mists. Those who assert that the negro laborer is indifferent 
to ‘the educational advantages of his children are not well in- 
formed. In a recent report, the distinguished State Super- 
intendent of North Carolina says: “It is manifest to me that 
if the negroes become convinced that they are to be deprived 
of their schools and of the opportunities of an education, 
most of the wisest and most self-respecting negroes will leave 
the State and eventually there will be left here only the indo- 
lent, worthless and criminal part of the negro population. 
Already there is considerable emigration of negroes from the 
State. There is no surer way to drive the best of them from 
the State than by keeping up this continual agitation about 
withdrawing from them the meager educational opportunities 
that they now have. This emigration in large numbers would 
result in a complication of the labor problem. Some of our 
Southern farms would be compelled to lie untenanted and un- 
tilled.” 
This phase of the economic problem appeals with force to 
those who are directly interested in their own personal wel- 
fare, as well as to those interested in the economic develop- 
ment of the South. The solution of the Southern labor prob- 
lem by means of foreign immigration has proven to be little 
more than a dream, and all efforts at colonization have so 
far met with poor success and little encouragement. With 
the lights before us, we are forced to conclude that the negro 
must remain in the South, and that he will continue as a fac- 
tor to be reckoned with in any scheme of industrial develop- 
ment. 
In the political arena the South has seldom failed to accom- 
plish her purposes. The disfranchising clauses of our South- 
ern State Constitutions, in my judgment, were wise and 
timely. But even our best and most sagacious statesmen re-

  garded them only in the light of temporary expedients. They 
have not only successfully and happily accomplished their 
avowed and immediate purposes, but have also accomplished 
other ends, then remote and unexpected. As an incidental re- 
sult, by no means intended, the negro has been sent to school. 
One of the most important incentives for our white boys to 
acquire an education was thus at least minimized, if not prac- 
tically taken away from them, and unwittingly given to the 
negro. As a result, the negro youth of the South are in 
school today, probably in proportionally larger numbers than 
the whites. If the negro cannot find a public school, he builds 
a private school. In South Carolina we are informed that 
the negroes have 718 private schoolhouses, while the whites 
have only 254. In Alabama, the estimated value of all pri- 
vate school property is $756,565, of which the negroes own 
$370,565, or 49 per cent of the whole, which is far more than 
their share, considering the disparity in wealth and popula- 
tion. The Atlanta Constitution, commenting upon the South 
Carolina statistics, says: “The report of the State Superin- 
tendent of Schools of South Carolina shows that the number 
of negroes taking the various studies in the common schools of 
that State overwhelmingly exceeds the number of white chil- 
dren engaged in similar branches.” “A highly important 
feature of these statistics is, that while they show little 
comparative disparity in the number of whites and blacks 
taking higher studies, the contrast in the attendance of whites 
and blacks in the primary studies, or the pupils who have 
enrolled but recently, is astounding. The fact demonstrates 
clearly the growing incentive that disfranchisement furnishes 
the negro to enter school.” 
The conclusion of the Atlanta Constitution with regard to 
South Carolina may be applicable, in varying degree, to the 
majority of the States of the South. Official enrollment sta- 
tistics of negro schools do not account for the increasingly 
large numbers in private and church schools, and therefore 
fail to tell the whole story. But there is still another item 
in our official statistics that should not pass unheeded. In 
at least some of our Southern States, the report shows that 
the negro percentage of daily attendance upon the number en- 
rolled is greater than the white percentage of average daily
-P-A-G-E-163

  attendance upon the enrollment. This greater interest in 
regularity of attendance by the negroes may be explained, 
in part at least, by their increasing sense of need, and con- 
sequently their more intense desire and more strenuous effort 
to obtain an education. Still another fact relating to school 
attendance needs to be emphasized. It is estimated that at 
present at least 25 per cent of the total illiteracy of the South 
is of school age, a fact which makes the problem more vital 
than it would be if all our illiteracy was confined to the adult 
population. Statistical tables, based upon the census of 
1900, have been widely published, without any refutation, as far 
as I know, showing that 30 per cent of the total white illiteracy 
of the South was of school age, 10 to 21, while only 27 per 
cent of the total negro illiteracy was of school age. Such sta- 
tistics must make us pause. We await with interest the 
revelations of the census of 1910 upon this point. 
It appears evident that those who object to compulsory at- 
tendance laws because of the negro, are aiming wide of the 
mark. The South needs compulsory education, but not for the 
negro. An old Scotch recipe for cooking the hare recites as a 
prerequisite, “First catch your hare.” The South has two hares 
to deal with—one white, the other black. The former is too 
often wary and had to catch; the latter, apparently of its own 
accord, leaps into the pot. 
Granting these statements, even as approximating the actual 
facts, what is the duty of the hour in the face of these facts? 
The South has never yet failed to respond with courage and 
patriotism to the call of duty. 
First of all, at the risk of digressing from my subject, let me 
emphasize the fact that the first indispensable step towards 
substantial progress in the education of the Southern negro, 
must be a more vigorous and determined campaign for the edu- 
cation of the white children of the South. To this end we must 
have better facilities, better teaching, better supervision and, 
above all, compulsory attendance laws. 
The old South devised an effective system of industrial train- 
ing on the plantation for the successful conversion of a non- 
descript mass of helpless ignorance and impotent chattel into 
a powerful economic asset; each individual unit was made eco- 
nomically productive. Can the new South, in this new time,
-P-A-G-E-164
164 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  through the agency of the school, train the descendants of those 
slaves to become productive, industrial units in the common- 
wealth? Dr. Knapp in one of his reports states that the pro- 
ductive power of the average farm worker in Iowa is seven 
times greater than that of the average farm worker in Alabama, 
North Carolina and South Carolina. How to raise the indi- 
vidiual in productive capacity to the Northern power, is the 
greatest economic problem that has ever confronted any people. 
It is urged that more money is needed for the accomplish- 
ment of this projected work than is now available. This is very 
true, but money is not the only essential. In any business or- 
ganization, administration is a vital element. No matter what 
its capital may be, the greatest trust on earth will become bank- 
rupt unless there be purpose, method and skill in its adminis- 
tration. It is estimated that the States of the South are ex- 
pending annually for negro education at least four million dol- 
lars, a sum representing the interest at four per cent upon an 
investment of one hundred million dollars. What would be 
thought in our modern business world of a corporation thus 
capitalized, but doing business without any specific policy, 
without any program of procedure, without expert supervision, 
and without any organization except that which is dictated by 
immediate necessity or political expediency. If this enormous 
investment is justifiable at all, and that question is not now de- 
batable, sound economy demands a specific aim, a definite pro- 
gram, and adequate skill. To bewail the entire policy of negro 
education is a belated cry; it is too late in this great day of 
our civilization to close the doors of the negro school. Those 
who insist that the negro cannot be trained, and that the State 
cannot be benefited by his training, are blind to the lessons of 
current history. The negro is getting an education, but how, 
by whom, and for what purpose, must be determined by our- 
selves. The negro children of the South are in the school, and 
it is our duty to see that that school has an industrially trained 
teacher, a teacher who can train children to do the things that 
need to be done. I concede that the negro is the logical teacher 
for the elementary negro school. The teacher and the pupil 
must possess a common race development, a common race con- 
sciousness. But, strongly as I insist upon the law of race 
identity in the elementary school, I must with equal force insist 
     
-P-A-G-E-165
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 165 
  that upon the plane of reason and the requirements of our 
civilization, the negro teacher must be sympathetically and help- 
fully directed by the skill and wisdom of the superior race. 
The negro schools of the South today, with few exceptions, are 
without supervision, except that of the most desultory and 
perfunctory character. In the absence of proper supervision 
or direction, these schools in the main are inefficient and waste- 
ful. Through the failure and negligence of school authorities, 
they accomplish little more than the useless waste of the re- 
sources of the State. The work of the average negro school, 
without direction or supervision, is little more than a faint 
echo of the courses of study and methods pursued in the aver- 
age white school. 
The people of the South are largely responsible for this condi- 
tion. So long as we insist upon uniformity, we cannot work 
out a separate course of study adapted to the needs of the negro. 
The widespread demand for statutory uniformity, together 
with the inhibition or unwise restriction of the local taxing 
power, must continue to paralyze initiative, and to harness 
progress, by reducing all communities to one common level, and 
placing all children, urban and rural, white and black, upon 
one common educational platform. We recognize the physi- 
cal difference of color in the races by providing separate schools 
for them. Let us further recognize their mental differences, 
their unequal capacities, and their widely differing life-func- 
tions and opportunities for human service, by providing sepa- 
rate courses of study and separate methods. Let us be con- 
sistent and fully justify our insistance upon race separation in 
the school. Of course, this can be done only under wise direc- 
tion and skilled supervision; it will require the maintenance 
by the State of negro institutes, conducted by experts, where 
the teachers of negro schools shall be trained for their specific 
work. It will also require that our State Board of Examiners 
shall abandon their rigid uniformity of academic requirements 
for State certificates, and find some method of determining 
the industrial qualifications of teachers as a basis for granting 
Industrial and Agricultural Certificates. Uniformity assumes 
equality, present or prospective, and makes the recognition of 
essential race differences impossible. With properly adjusted 
courses of study and skilled supervision, the great investment
-P-A-G-E-166

  made in negro education by the South may be made profitable 
to the negro, and productive of benefit to the State. The negro 
school should be made an instrument for the elevation of the 
negro laborer, by training him for the immediate work of the 
shop, the field and the household, and an efficient means for the 
development of such qualities as are calculated to promote his 
happiness and usefulness in the civilization in which he is des- 
tined to become a factor. In the rural schools of the South there 
is little excuse for the existence of the purely academic negro 
school. In our city schools, the mere training of the negro 
child in books leaves him too commonly with what proves at 
its best but a chaotic jumble of incoherent knowledge, a veneer 
of artificial culture, which readily yields under strain, and a 
woeful distaste for any useful service. In consequence he be- 
comes an habitual street idler, living by prey; or he becomes 
the prey of the designing and predatory vultures of both races. 
If, perchance, he is temporarily forced to work, in shop or 
household, his unwilling and untrained service is profitless both 
to himself and to his employer. 
And yet this work may be controlled and directed by our 
State, county and city authorities. If these schools fail to give 
the negro that kind of training that will fit him for intelligent 
and useful service, where lies the fault? The negro public 
school is the one instrumentality controlled and directed by the 
State for the great work of converting the negro youth of the 
South into a body of intelligent workers, each unit an indus- 
trial factor, and the whole an increasingly valuable economic 
asset in her agricultural and industrial development. As I 
have already shown, Southern politics and Divine Providence 
have prepared the opportunity by placing the negro in school. 
Will the South rise to the opportunity and purposefully take 
charge of the negro public school? There are abundant reasons 
why she should. The negro invites such direction and super- 
vision; the economic welfare of the State demands it; the re- 
quirements of public health and sanitation make it an imme- 
diate and imperative duty, and the incentives of philanthropy 
and humanity, civic welfare and political expediency, are re- 
enforced by the demands of enlightened public and individual 
self-interest. 
But the direction and supervision by the State of the negro
-P-A-G-E-167
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 167 
public school is not sufficient. Every educational agency for 
the advancement of the negro should be planned in accordance 
with a definite educational policy along industrial and economic 
lines, and should be subject to direction and skilled supervision. 
Every private institution for the education of the negro should 
be registered by the State, and its courses of study and meth- 
ods should be planned and subjected to frequent inspection by 
expert educational authorities. 
The South welcomes the aid of the philanthropist in the 
education of the Southern negro, and is grateful for the splen- 
did work that has been accomplished by mission schools and 
philanthropic institutions established and maintained by the 
noble self-sacrifice of those who in the years of the past have 
sympathized with the South in her financial extremities, and 
with the negro in his educational necessities. But, after more 
than thirty years of sympathetic interest and careful observa- 
tion, I have reached the deliberate conclusion that the majority 
of these schools are out of touch, if not at positive variance, with 
the communities in which they exist, and with the civilization 
they seek to serve. The isolation of such an institution, from 
both the official and social life of the community, exercises a 
blighting influence upon the student body that must inevitably 
widen the chasm of race prejudice. The baneful influence of 
some of these institutions, controlled by long distance agencies, 
is responsible for much of the current opposition to the educa- 
tion of the Southern negro. If such institutions were placed 
under the management, control and supervision of local authori- 
ties, State or municipal, I believe their influence and power for 
good would be increased a thousand fold. The life of the negro 
school must be coérdinated with the civilization in which it ex- 
ists; its success and efficiency must depend upon community 
sympathy and public confidence. 
We hear a great deal today of “social efficiency” as the chief 
end of the school. It behooves us to remember that before 
the individual or the race can attain the goal of social efti- 
ciency, it must first realize personal and industrial efficiency. 
A man must be enabled to do something for himself before he 
can do anything for society. To accomplish this, our uni- 
formity policy should be relaxed so that the negro child may 
enter school at an earlier age than the white child. The chro- 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
168 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  nological minimum age requirement of our State Constitutions 
overlook important anatomical and psychological race differ- 
ences. The real negro child is older than the average white 
child of the same age. This is not at all paradoxical; it is 
easily explained by the great biological law of “the prolonga- 
tion of infancy.” Thousands of negro youth receive practi- 
cally no benefit from the school because they begin too late. 
Their shortened period of infancy closes with the early arrest 
of brain growth, and they spend the remainder of life, men- 
tally, in a state of comparative childhood. 
Not only should the negro child enter school relatively 
earlier than the white child, but he should be provided with 
kindergartens and nursery schools, where he could receive 
training in moral and industrial habits, which would become 
automatic before the period of arrest is reached. Any train- 
ing given the negro after the age of twelve or fourteen, when 
the higher faculties become inactive, has little effect upon his 
moral character, and remains only as an artificial gloss, 
through which the earlier acquired automatic habits easily 
break and assert themselves. I believe in the kindergarten 
as the most efficient and economic agency available for the 
training of the negro in moral and industrial habits. It is 
true that the South as yet is scarcely prepared for such a 
movement, although a substantial beginning has already been 
made in several Southern States, where negro kindergartens 
are fostered by women’s clubs and School Improvement Asso- 
ciations. 
The conditions I have here dispassionately attempted to re- 
view, seem to me to point unerringly to the culmination of a 
critical era in the status of negro education in the South. The 
field is ripening for the harvest. Civil and political exi- 
gencies, economic and moral obligations, combine in the cre- 
ation of the South’s greatest opportunity. The education of 
the Southern negro by the States of the South is not simply a 
philanthropic and moral duty; it is not simply a civic respon- 
sibility; it is the unavoidable price of industrial freedom, the 
essential condition of economic salvation. 
But do not understand me to limit the obligation for the 
accomplishment of this task to the South alone. While the 
South must be held primarily responsible for the administra-
-P-A-G-E-169
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 169 
  tion of its own educational policies, the nation has its para- 
mount obligation and responsibility. The Federal Goyern- 
ment has recognized, though tardily, its duty to the American 
Indian; it has spent its treasures of blood and money for the 
freedom of the Cubans, and is today most generously aiding 
in the education of the Porto Ricans and the Filipinos. The 
time is now ripening for the recognition of a solemn obliga- 
tion to contribute to the education of its own immediate wards 
at home. The strong arm of the nation, that gave to the 
negro personal and civil freedom, should no longer permit the 
South unaided and alone to fight the battle of his educational 
and industrial liberty. 
Upon the teachers of the South primarily devolves the duty 
of providing a rational and practical program of negro educa- 
tion, and to reconstruct, if need be, the entire course of study 
for the negro school. It may require bold statement and 
heroic treatment, but we cannot evade our present responsi- 
bility, nor escape our future accountability. It is not to ex- 
traneous agencies, no matter how abundant or how helpful, 
but to the State-supported public school that the South must 
look for the efficient training of the negro masses. A rational 
program for the education of the Southern negro, wisely and 
sympathetically administered, must eventually restore the 
race to its legitimate place in the industrial and economic 
system of the South. By this course alone will the South 
most effectively promote the welfare of the Southern negro, 
reéstablish her economic and commercial supremacy, and dis- 
charge her obligations to the world’s civilization. (Applause.)

of thoroughness within the time limits which this occasion 
affords. The solution of the problem of negro education in- 
volves to a greater or a less degree the study of every impor- 
tant phase of the whole realm of human development. AI- 
ready abundant literature which treats of the problem is avail- 
able. Some of it is the result of careful and unprejudiced 
thinking; much of it, however, has been evolved from the 
inner consciousness of ill-informed and passionately biased 
partisans. The summary and valuation of the magazine ar- 
ticles, books, pamphlets, reports and special studies would 
alone afford a task too large to be treated in even a volume 
of cyclopedic proportions. I shall, therefore, in order not to 
weary your patience, confine this paper, first, to a brief his- 
torical survey, and, second, to a still more hasty presentation 
of some important principles to control the education which 
the negro has a right to enjoy, and which should be guaran- 
teed him by the Southern white man, with whom his lot is cast. 
I. HISTORICAL SURVEY. 
The education of negroes in our section of the country began 
long before the Revolutionary War, when they were brought 
as slaves into the Southern Colonies. Not a few of them were 
taught to read and to write by Southern white women and 
children, many a wife of a salve-owner taking an unfeigned 
interest in this philanthropic work. It has been estimated 
that, about the time of the opening of the Civil War, ten per 
cent of the adult slaves had, by the benevolent offices of their 
white owners, been elevated out of the class of illiterates. In 
struction was not confined solely to secular subjects, as les- 
sons in the Sacred Scriptures and the Christian religion, both 
practical and theoretical, were quite common. A celebrated 
man engaged in this form of benevolence was Thomas J. Jack- 
son, who was elected in 1851 professor of natural philosophy 
and artillery tactics in the Virginia Military Institute. While 
serving in this capacity he also founded, and conducted until 
the opening of the Civil War, a Sunday School, the pupils con- 
sisting of negro slaves of all ages. The founder served as 
Superintendent, and the work of the school was carried for- 
ward with the same grave enthusiasm and orderly efficiency

as subsequently characterized the management of his great 
military campaigns in Virginia. 
Negroes who had obtained their freedom, either by gift or by 
purchase, enjoyed educational privileges to an even greater de- 
gree. It is true that, after the Revolutionary War and after 
_ the adoption of the Constitution and the establishment of the 
National Government, in some of the Southern States there 
existed statutory provisions against the education of negroes, 
even free negroes. To cite one example: Mrs. Margaret 
Douglass, who lived in Norfolk, Virginia, was, in 1853, ar- 
rested for teaching a school attended by free negro children, 
the offense being “against the peace and dignity of the Com- 
monwealth of Virginia.” Being duly tried, she was convicted, 
and a sentence of thirty days’ imprisonment was imposed 
upon her, a punishment which the trial Judge declared was to 
“serve as a terror to those who acknowledged no rule of action 
but their own evil will and pleasure.” Nevertheless, these 
statutory enactments denying the privileges of schooling to 
negroes, did not arrest the development of the black race in 
the South. Everywhere education along many vocational lines 
was compulsory. The negro was taught to speak, and in many 
instances to read and to write the English language, and not 
infrequently his conversation with his white master was di- 
rected along lines both wholesome and stimulating. He was 
permitted, and even encouraged, to exchange the traditions 
of African superstition for the inspiring truths of the Chris- 
tian religion, and to become acquainted with the English Bible, 
the greatest of the world’s classics. When it is remembered 
that the greater part, and the more substantial part, of edu- 
cation consists in doing, rather than in knowing, in the for- 
mation of right habits rather than in the memorizing of mere 
word-forms, one easily reaches the conclusion that the educa- 
tional regimen of the negro prior to the Civil War produced 
splendid results, arming him with the intelligence and the 
power that come from the mastery of various forms of indus- 
trial activity and endowing him with the elemental habits of 
civilized society. That these were bona fide results is suffi- 
ciently evidenced by the fact that, so far as I am informed, 
during the Civil War, when the white men of the South able to 
bear arms were away from their homes, and when their fami-
-P-A-G-E-172

lies were left to the care of the slaves, not one instance of arson 
or other heinous crime was charged against these faithful 
servants. The truth is, that the system of slavery which ob- 
tained in the South was as benign as was ever known among 
men, and, while there were some exceptions, the rule was that 
master and servant occupied not only that relation, but the 
relation of friends, also. This view is illustrated in a recent 
novel, The Long Roll, written by Mary Johnston. In describ- 
ing a short visit of a Confederate soldier to his home just after 
the fight of the Monitor and the Merrimac, the author relates 
that his black mammy met him at the top of the steps, exclaim- 
ing, “Oh, my lamb! oh, glory hallelujah! What you doin’ wid 
dem wohnout cloes an’ yo sh’ut tohn dat-er-way? What dey 
been doin’ ter you—dat’s what I wants ter know? My po’ 
lamb! Marse Edward, don’ you laugh kaze mammy done fergit 
you ain’ ’er baby still.’ And then the novelist adds, with a 
touch true to nature: “Edward hugged her, and remarked, 
‘One night in the trenches not long ago I heard you singing, 
mammy. I could not sleep, and at last I said, “I’ll put my 
head in mammy’s lap, and she’ll sing me The Buzzards and the 
Butterflies, and I will go to sleep.” I did it, and I went off like 
a baby.’ ” 
Whatever may have been the sins of the old South—and 
every well-informed Southerner is now willing to confess at 
least some of them, and that, too, without any degree of dis- 
loyalty, her development of the negro slaves, as indicated above, 
is convincing evidence of her intelligence and philanthropy. 
In those old days the love of money, which is the root of more 
than on grievous evil, had certainly not taken possession of our 
fathers, and had not blinded them in the discharge of their 
duties toward a race which, in the providence of God, had 
been placed in their keeping. 
During the Civil War the education of the negro, as well 
as of the white children, was sadly interrupted. Nevertheless, 
his experience-in caring for his master’s family and property 
confirmed some habits the negro had already acquired. There 
were, furthermore, philanthropic people in the North, who 
established some schools for negroes who had refugeed to 
Union camps, and the United States Government also estab- 
lished schools more or less effectively in various places, and
-P-A-G-E-173

provided the.means for conducting them. They were, at best, 
most elementary in their nature, and were administered with- 
out either expert teaching or supervision. When a people are 
engaged in a mighty military struggle, one cannot expect that 
serious attention will be given to consideration of plans for 
the promotion of educational progress. Napoleon remarked on 
one occasion when the Swiss educator, Pestalozzi, was seek- 
ing an interview with the great First Consul, “I cannot be 
bothered about questions of A, B, C.”* 
Inspired by the efforts of the Emancipation League of Bos- 
ton and by other freedman’s aid associations, Congress, on 
March 8, 1865, passed the bill which established the Freedman’s 
Bureau. General Oliver O. Howard, the commander of the 
Army of Tennessee, was appointed Commissioner, and, in com- 
pliance with the statute, he appointed ten assistant commis- 
sioners, who severally had charge of the ten districts into 
which the South was divided. Among these assistant com- 
missioners was Colonel John Eaton, Jr. (afterwards United 
States Commissioner of Education), who had charge of the 
District of Columbia, including Maryland and three counties 
in Virginia. At first Arkansas and Texas constituted one dis- 
trict; but somewhat later Texas became a separate district, 
and General E. M. Gregory was appointed Assistant Commis- 
sioner therefor. In his honor a school for negro pupils was 
founded in Houston, Texas, and was named The Gregory In- 
stitute. 
General Howard was a man of excellent character. While 
he was faithful to the doctrine of emancipation, and while he 
believed that the negro is capable of improvement, he could by 
no means be classed among the ultra-radical abolitionists of 
his time. He had the confidence of military men and of philan- 
thropic associations. Concerning him General Sherman said, 
“I cannot imagine that matters that may involve the future 
*On his return to Switzerland, Pestalozzi was asked: “Did you 
see Bonaparte?’ “No,” replied Pestalozzi, “I did not see Bonaparte, 
and Bonaparte did not see me.” Concerning this circumstance, Quick, 
in his Educational Reformers (page 348), writes: “The whirligig of 
time brings in his revenges, and before the close of the century Europe 
already thinks more in amount, and immeasurably more in respect, of 
Pestalozzi than of Bonaparte.”

  of four millions of souls could have been put in more charitable 
or more benevolent hands.” * 
The work of the bureau was divided into four departments: 
(1) Land; (2) official acts relating to labor, schools, quarter- 
master and commissary supplies; (3) financial affairs; (4) 
medical and hospital service. The educational functions of 
the bureau were under the general direction of a special of- 
ficer in Washington; but the ten assistant commissioners ap- 
pointed superintendents of education to supervise the schools 
of their respective districts. 
When the bureau was established, there were already in ex- 
istence some schools attended by freedmen and refugees. Some 
of them were day schools for the younger negro children; 
others were night schools, in which older boys and girls and 
adults were instructed. There were also some industrial 
schools, in which women were instructed as seamstresses, and 
Sunday schools, in which the elements of secular and religious 
education were taught. The bureau sought to codperate with 
the individuals and the benevolent associations by whom these 
schools had been founded. 
Still greater powers relating to education were given to the 
bureau by the act of July 16, 1866, the commissioner being di- 
rected to lease buildings for school purposes whenever teachers 
and means of instruction could be provided without cost to the 
government, and he was to furnish such protection as might 
be required for the safe conduct of these schools. Congress 
appropriated $521,000 for school expenses, and also provided 
additional funds to be derived from the sale and lease of prop- 
erty which had formerly belonged to the Confederate Govern- 
ment, but which the United States had acquired by confisca- 
tion or otherwise. Another act, passed June 24, 1868, directed 
that all unexpended balances in the hands of the Commis. 
sioner, not required for the due execution of the law, might, 
in his discretion, be devoted to the education of freedmen and 
refugees. 
In 1872 the bureau was abolished by law; its work had

granted it an appropriation. In the year last named the bureau 
received reports from 2,677 day and night secular schools, in 
which were 3,300 teachers and about 150,000 pupils, and from 
1,562 Sunday schools, with 6,007 teachers and about 100,000 
pupils. 
It is easy to demonstrate that the efforts of the Commissioner 
and his subordinates to educate the negroes in the South were 
far from successful. The greater part of the instruction given 
was confined to exceedingly elementary phases of education, 
and the instruction itself was too often decidedly poor in 
quality. The negro scholastic population in the South in 1870 
was nearly 1,700,000, while only about 150,000 were in the 
secular schools. With less than one-tenth of the children at 
school, with almost the entire adult negro population grossly 
ignorant, with teachers ill-prepared for their duties, the edu- 
cation of the negro was in an exceedingly crude, not to say 
lamentable, condition. In this connection, however, one should 
not forget that the ravages of war, and the even more grievous 
afflictions visited upon the South during the days of Recon- 
struction, made it well-nigh impossible to establish an efficient 
system of public education for her white children, not to speak 
of the children of the former slaves. 
Dr. J. L. M. Curry, who was a valiant Confederate soldier, 
who was for many years general agent of the trustees of the 
Peabody fund, who was the consistent and courageous friend 
of the negro, and whose name is a household word in education 
circles in the South, thus sums up the value of the educational 
work of the bureau: “What was done locally and individually 
was almost universally short-lived and in utter misapprehen- 
sion of conditions and methods.” * 
The same mistake was made in education as in the political 
treatment of the South—the powers in control overlooked the 
fact that the first indispensable requirement for-success in any 
social undertaking is a thorough understanding of the condi- 
tions that obtain. On this point Booker T. Washington, one 
of the really great leaders of his race, remarks: “Men have 
tried to use with these simple people just freed from slavery

    and with no past, no inherited traditions of understanding, the 
same methods of education which they have used in New Eng- 
land, with all its inherited traditions and desires.” * 
The bureau should, surely, not be held entirely responsible 
for the mistaken policy which resulted in giving the negro a 
mere smattering of culture, for the teachers and the benevolent 
societies very largely determined the methods actually em- 
ployed, the bureau’s activities being confined chiefly to the 
financial side of the difficult problem, the annual amounts dis- 
tributed for educational purposes ranging from $27,000 in 
1865 to more'than $1,000,000 in 1870, and the total sum appor- 
tioned from June 1, 1865, to September 1, 1871, being more 
than $5,000,000. 
While it is true that the schools under the control of the 
bureau could not by any grace of courtesy be regarded as ef- 
ficient, yet there is unquestioned evidence that its work em- 
phasized the necessity for elementary education ; that it demon- 
strated the importance of systematic administration, and that 
it aided in the development of public opinion in the direction 
of higher education, especially for the men and women to be 
employed as teachers. It is in these higher institutions, such 
as Fisk University, Howard University, and Hampton Insti- 
tute, the founding of which were encouraged by the bureau, 
and in smaller institutions founded since 1870, that the South- 
ern negro finds opportunity to fit himself for geninue service. 
Public education for the negro at public expense in the sey- 
eral Southern States during the era of reconstruction requires 
no extended treatment, for, while the Constitution adopted by 
the carpetbag governments included articles relating to the or- 
ganization and conduct of systems of public free schools, 
these educational measures did not become effective. The an- 
tipathy of the Southern people to the rule of the carpetbaggers 
inspired resistance, both passive and active, to educational as 
well as to other governmental policies the reconstructionists 
attempted to establish. The free schools were generally re- 
garded by the white man as part and parcel of that system 
which sought to enslave him and place him under the domina- 
tion of his former slaves and their abolition friends. The re-

  construction era, which was responsible for more evils and 
which engendered fiercer passions and more deep-seated preju- 
dices than the Civil War, was fortunately brought to a close 
early in the seventies of the last century, and the people of our 
common country, North and South, are now practically unani- 
mous in the opinion that the efforts to restore the Union by re- 
ducing one-half of its people to a state of vassalage and by 
seeking to keep them in subjection by force, was the greatest 
political blunder made by the party that had been victorious 
in war, and had destroyed the institution of slavery in the 
United States. When the white people in each of the Southern 
States regained their liberty and took charge of their own 
State governments, they at once began the stupendous task of 
providing for a system of public free schools, and, to their 
credit be it said, opportunities for free education were ex- 
tended to whites and blacks alike, at least so far as constitu- 
tional and statutory measures are concerned. 
It is true that immediately after the close of the recontruc- 
tion era there was some opposition to popular education, espe- 
cially for the negroes; yet the public school idea steadily won 
its way, and today no people in the wide world are more de- 
voted to the democratic ideal manifested in public education 
at public expense than are to be found in America south of 
Mason and Dixon’s line. Nowhere does there exist a stronger, 
a more militant conviction that the safety and perpetuity of 
democracy is dependent upon popular intelligence and virtue. 
The South is today irrevocably committed to the doctrine that, 
as President Lamar once wrote in a message to the Congress of 
the Republic of Texas, “cultivated mind is the guardian genius 
of democracy. It is the only dictator which freemen acknowl- 
edge and the only security which freemen desire.” 
Thirty or forty years is a very short time in the life of a peo- 
ple, and it is an exceedingly brief period in the evolution of 
a great institution like a system of public education. The 
South, however, in this short space of time has accomplished 
educational results that are indeed not far from marvelous. 
The testimony to support this view is strong and ‘abundant. 
The late United States Commissioner of Education, Dr. Wil- 
liam T. Harris, declared at a National Congress of Education 
held in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1895, that “the Southern people 
12
-P-A-G-E-178

    in the organization and management of. systems of public 
schools manifest wonderful and remarkable self-sacrifice.” 
Concerning educational advantages supplied to the negro, 
competent witnesses living North as well as South, men of 
African as well as of Caucasion descent, are agreed that in all 
the history of the world there has been no higher manifesta- 
tion of justice and liberality by a superior to an inferior race 
than the South has shown in its efforts to improve the intel- 
lectual condition of the black population. Of the many men 
who have spoken on this point is Dr. Lyman Abbott, editor of 
The Outlook. Below I give his opinion, an opinion which is 
typical, and which is to be found in an article written by him 
and published in Volume 83, pages 634-639 of that journal: 
“While Northern benevolence has spent tens of thousands of dollars 
in the South to educate the negroes, Southern patriotism has spent 
hundreds of thousands of dollars for the same purpose. This has been 
done voluntarily and without aid from the Federal Government.” 
Out of their poverty the Southern States have contributed 
millions of dollars to educate the negroes. It is impossible to 
determine the exact amount of this expenditure, because sepa- 
rate accounts for negro education have not been kept by the 
several State governments. In only two or three of the States 
are they so kept at this time. The State of Texas, from 1870 
to the close of the scholastic year ending August 31, 1911, ex- 
pended upon common school eduation for negroes about $23,- 
500,000, and for the support of the Prairie View Normal School, 
an institution for the training of negro teachers, there has 
been expended since 1879, $715,382. The estimated value of 
schoolhouses and school property used by the negro schools of 
that State is $1,500,000, the greater portion of which was de- 
rived from taxes paid and from donations made by white citi- 
ens. In the State of Virginia there has been spent since 1871 
between fifteen and eighteen millions of dollars upon the com- 
mon school education of the negro, and that State is now 
spending about $600,000 a year therefor. 
The figures given for Texas and Virginia may be properly 
regarded as fairly representative of all the Southern States. 
Not one of these States has failed to provide for common schoo} 
education for negroes on substantially equal terms with the 
whites, and in addition normal schools have been founded and
-P-A-G-E-179
        JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 179    
maintained in order that competent teachers may be trained 
for work in the negro schools. In a letter I received some days 
ago from Monroe N. Work, who in charge of the Department 
of Research and Records in the Tuskegee Normal and Indus- 
trial Institute, he estimates that the amount devoted to negro 
education in the South for the forty years ending with the 
academic session of 1910-11 is, approximately, one hundred and 
sixty-six millions of dollars. When it is remembered that the 
negroes own a very small per cent of the taxable property in 
the South, the figures given above are convincing evidence of 
the sincere desire of the Southern white man to give to the 
negro the blessings of at least a common school education. It 
should, furthermore, be remembered that while the negro 
schools, even today, are not as efficient as they should be, and 
while many of the negro children are not matriculated in even 
these inferior schools, the public schools for the white children, 
especially in rural districts, are themselves far from ideal. 
There is reason for believing, however, that in the fullness of 
time with the continuance of that progress which forms a 
bright page in the educational history of our country, the pub 
lic schools for blacks, as well as whites, will function with 
such efficiency as will guarantee reasonably satisfactory re- 
sults. This optimistic view was well expressed, but not under- 
stood, by a little piccaninny, who, some years ago, when di- 
rected by his teacher to form a sentence containing the word 
delight, wrote the following inspiring words on his slate: “De 
light am a breakin’.” 
II. SOME PRINCIPLES OF THE PROGRAM FOR NEGRO EDUCATION. 
I regret that this important topic must necessarily be dis- 
missed with most superficial discussion. It will no doubt, in 
the years to come, receive at the hands of educational leaders 
the attention which its magnitude and difficulty merit and re- 
quire. Only six principles or planks in the program will now 
be submitted, and some of them without elaboration. 
1. In the negro are to be found the essential elements of hu- 
man nature, and, therefore, he can be educated. He is not an 
anthropoid ape, which has no capacity for real thinking and 
which responds only to instinct and to mere training. The 
one great human attribute in which all men, including the    
    
-P-A-G-E-180
  180 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
negro, share, is reason, which gives insight into the relations 
of things, a result which marks both the beginning and the 
end of wisdom. 
This plank of the program requires that we carefully ex- 
amine our prejudices against the black race, and determine 
whether these prejudices be founded upon facts. There is no 
doubt that racial influences exist. Thorndike is of the opin- 
ion that “differences in remote ancestry account for a very 
large percentage of the differences among men, if we consider 
both their direct effect upon original nature and their indirect 
effect through the differences in training which commonly 
parallel them.” * 
But, while the racial element is to be considered a factor, 
environment, also, must undoubtedly be reckoned with. The 
value of this second factor is not yet known. How far train- 
ing can modify and overcome original mental characteristics, 
nobody has yet determined. Boaz, in his work entitled, The 
Mind of Primitive Man, published this year, devotes a chapter 
to race problems in the United States. Concerning the ques- 
tion, how far undesirable traits now found in the negro popu- 
lation are due to racial influences, and how far they are due to 
social environment for which that population is not account- 
able, he reaches this conclusion : 
“To this question anthropology can give the decided answer that the 
traits of African culture as observed in the aboriginal home of the negro 
are those of a healthy, primitive people, with a considerable degree of 
personal initiative, with a talent for organization, and with imaginative 
power, with technical skill and thrft. Nether is a warlike spirit ab- 
sent in the race, as proved by the mighty conquerors who overthrew 
States and founded new empires, and by the courage of the armies 
tbat follow the bidding of their leaders. There is nothing to prove 
that licentiousness, shiftless laziness, lack of initiative, are’ funda- 
mental characteristics of the race. Everything points out that these 
qualities are the result of social conditions, rather than of hereditary 
traits.” + 
He remarks with emphasis, however, that it would be alto- 
gether a fallacious view to assume that there are no differences 
in the makeup of the negro race and other races, and that their 
activities should run in the same line. I am reminded here 
* Thorndyke’s Individuality, p. 35. 
+ Boaz’s The Mind of Primitive Man, p. 271. 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 181 
that this conclusion of Professor Boaz was once expressed by a 
good old uncle in the black belt to a hot-gospel reformer who 
had come South, bringing with him idealistic notions concern- 
ing people of African descent. As the missionary was con- 
versing one day with Uncle Josh, a Caucasian gentleman liv- 
ing in the neighborhood appeared. The negro at once 
raised his hat, and with cordial courtesy remarked, “Good 
mawnin,’ Marse George.” “Good morning, Joshua,” was the 
reply, and the negro’s white friend passed on. When he was 
out of earshot, the philanthropist from the North said, “What 
do you mean by calling that man ‘Marse George?’ Don’t you 
know that Lincoln freed you, and that now you have as many 
rights as anybody, and that you are as good as anybody; that 
you are as good as I am?” “Oh, yas, suh!” said the wise black 
man, “I knows I’se as good as you is; but you and me and 
twenty mo’ like us ain’t as good as Marse George.” 
‘Whatever determination shall finally be reached concerning 
the respective values of racial inheritance and of modification 
by environment, however’ well founded may be certain racial 
instincts, it seems clear that in the education of the negro he 
should be granted every reasonable opportunity to make all the 
advancement of which he is capable. To deny him such oppor- 
tunity is un-Christian, undemocratic and unsafe. This view 
of the question is held I believe by the great majority of the 
better-informed white people of the South, and it has led the 
directors of the Young Men’s Christian Associations in South- 
ern colleges to incoporate into their work for this year the 
systematic study of a treatise which is entitled Negro Life in 
the South, and of which Dr. W. M. Weatherford, a native 
Texan, is the author. I am informed that more than five thou- 
and college students are now engaged in mastering that excel- 
lent book. The rational attitude of mind toward the black 
race, as manifested in this new movement of the Y. M. C. A., 
was eloquently described a few years ago in these words by 
that great Bishop of the Methodist Church, the late Charles 
B. Galloway: 
“The right education of the negro is at once a duty and a necessity. 
All the resources of the school should be exhausted in elevating his 
character, improving his condition, and increasing his capacity as a 
citizen. . . . From the declaration that education has made the 
‘
-P-A-G-E-182
182 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
negro more immoral and criminal, I am constrained to dissent. 
Indisputable facts attest the statement that education and higher ae 
tendant influences bave elevated the standard and tone of morals among 
the negroes of the South. . . . I believe it is perfectly safe to say 
that not a single case of criminal assault has ever been charged against 
a student of a mission school for negroes founded and sustained by a 
great Christian denomination. . . . This is no question for small 
politicians, but for broad, patriotic statesmen. It is not for non-resi- 
dent theorists, but for practical publicists; not for academic senti- 
mentalists, but for clear-visioned humanitarians. All our dealings 
with these people should be in the spirit of the Man of Galilee.” * 
  2. Education being a process of conscious evolution, the 
negro himself must, by his own self-active efforts, reach higher 
levels of intelligence and character. The observance of this 
principle will lead him to exercise great patience, and the 
white man even greater. As long as there is “first the blade, 
and then the ear, and then the full corn in the ear” in the 
physical world, we must not expect development with light- 
ning-like rapidity in any social institution. If this principle 
be correct, the negro children ‘should be taught by negro 
teachers. 
In Charleston, South Carolina, however, a contrary policy 
has long obtained. So unique is the educational experiment 
made in that city that I give below a letter received last month 
from Mr. W. K. Tate, the State Supervisor of Elementary 
Rural Schools in South Carolina: 
“Your information that young women belonging to the best South- 
ern families are engaged in teaching in the public schools for negroes 
in Charleston is correct. This policy has been pursued ever since the 
establishment of the public school system in Charleston. The public 
school system of Charleston originated before the war, and at the out- 
break of the war between the States there were four large public schools 
in operation in Charleston. The people have never regarded the public 
school system a product of reconstruction, but as their own institution. 
“The negroes have always been in the majority in the city of 
Charleston. The explanation of the fact that the white teachers are 
employed in the negro schools may be stated in substance as follows: 
The white people realize that the teaching which the negroes receive 
under white instruction is much better than that which they would 
receive with negro teachers. They wish to get along pleasantly with 
the negroes, and to do so they believe that their instruction should be in 
the hands of the white people. There has never been the slightest fric- 
* An Era of Progress and Promise, p. 557.
-P-A-G-E-183
    
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 183 
  tion between the races in Charleston, and the people attribute this to the 
fact that the negroes have been brought up under white discipline and 
white instruction. 
“The young women who teach in the negro schools do not, in the 
slightest degree, lose their social prestige. They are transferred from 
the negro schools to the white schools with the greatest freedom, and 
many of the best principals now employed in the city began their work 
as principals in negro schools. The majority of negroes themselves 
prefer the white teachers. I have had from no less authority than 
Dr. George S. Dickerman, who has observed widely, that the discipline 
and instruction in the negro schools in Charleston are the best he has 
seen in the United States. 
“T was connected with the Charleston schools for twelve years, serv- 
ing for some years as Assistant Superintendent of Schools. Some of 
the most efficient teachers in the city are teaching in negro schools. 
There are evident objections to the system; but it is a sufficient answer 
to say in Charleston that it has worked well, and has certainly pro- 
duced an understanding between the races I have found nowhere else. 
“I know of no other Southern city in which this condition prevails.” 
This principle provides furthermore for the selection of such 
culture-materials, and such administrative machinery, and such 
methods of instruction as are dictated by concrete, rather than 
abstract, idealism. The negro race being, relatively speaking, 
in the infant stage of civilized life, should not be expected to 
undergo all the training that belongs to higher races. This 
principle undoubtedly justifies great emphasis upon vocational 
studies in the school, for the basis of human life and human 
civilization is physical. It does not imply, however, that the 
negro should be compelled to level down in his education to 
preparation for becoming a mere work animal, for such a 
policy would disregard the higher human elements with which 
even the lowest of races is endowed: 
The next three principles I shall not discuss, but shall merely 
formulate as follows: 
3. The professional education of teachers is an indispensable 
agency for the elevation of the negroes in the South. 
How meager are the qualifications of the negro teacher is shown in 
the following tables, which refer to Texas and which reveal a situa- 
tion no more unfortunate than exists in other States in the South: 
Certificated Negro Teachers in the Common School Districts, and in 
Independent Districts with fewer than 150 scholastics, in Texas for 
the year 1909-10: 
Holders of County Certificates—Third grade, 171; Second grade, 
829; First grade, 39; Permanent, 6; Total, 1,045.

Permanent, 186; Total, 1,210. 
Graduates—Of high schools, 92; of normal schools, 159; of colleges 
and universities, 45; Total, 296. 
4, Efficient supervision of the negro schools can be accom- 
plished only by professional experts having adequate opportuni- 
ties for the discharge of their functions. 
One has only to read the recent report of Jackson Davis, State Su- 
pervisor of Rural Hlementary Schools in Virginia, in order to be con- 
vinced of the importance of the supervision of negro schools. 
5. The compulsory education of the negro is demanded upon 
both educational and political grounds. 
6. The sixth principle may be stated thus: The education 
of the Southern negro should be marked by the continuous 
manifestation of the spirit of codperation on the part of all 
who are concerned in the welfare of the nation. Such a spirit 
will lead to the study of actual conditions, facts will be kept 
in authentic records, and in time we shall have at our com- 
mand a great wealth of material which will enable us to dis- 
cover the wisest plans for promoting the educational progress 
of the negro, as well as the means best adapted to that great 
work, Inspired and directed by such a spirit we may hope 
to accomplish what seems to be the will of God in extending 
to the negro race in America the blessings of democracy, along 
with the obligations which democracy imposes. *

  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 189 
The Chair announced that advice had been received from 
Dr. A. J. McKelway, of Washington, D. C., to the effect that 
it was impossible for him to be present, but that he would be 
represented by Mr. E. N. Clopper, Mississippi Valley Secretary 
of the National Child Labor Committee. Mr. Clopper was 
introduced and presented the following paper on 
THE EDUCATION OF FACTORY CHILDREN IN 
THE SOUTH. 
BE. N. CLOPPER. 
The trade journal of an important American industry which 
has been a notorious employer of child labor, recently declared 
in an editorial that no boy could live on a knowledge of reading, 
writing and arithmetic; that one man might be able to speak 
and read a dozen languages, and still not be decent enough to 
behave himself; and that another man might be so illiterate 
as not to know B from a bull’s foot and yet be a good husband 
and father; this is all very true, but the paper went on to 
say that for this reason it was opposed to an educational quali- 
fication for labor, and declared that if it could it would remove 
every educational requirement, and when anyone asked for 
employment it would only look at his teeth and examine his 
stomach. It seems almost incredible that an American in this 
day and age could put into cold print such an absurd, reaction- 
ary statement. There can be no enlightened public opinion 
without public education, and without enlightened public 
opinion a nation cannot prosper. Child labor and education 
do not go hand in hand—the one works against the other. Child 
labor means adult ignorance, and adult ignorance means disas- 
ter. But substitute education and training during childhood 
in place of employment in gainful occupations, and what it the 
result? The knowledge and efficiency acquired make laborers 
scorn the meagre wages and refuse to tolerate the bad condi- 
tions which the ignorant and untrained blindly accept, and so 
force all forms of pauper labor to decrease before the irresist- 
ible demand for a higher standard of comfort. Study labor 
conditions all over the world, and in every community where 
wages are low with respect to the cost of living, you find a 
correspondingly low standard of comfort. On the other hand,
-P-A-G-E-190
    190 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
where wages are high, you find better equipment, more skill, 
less cost of production and wider markets. England has stead- 
ily advanced to a position of industrial supremacy, and every 
step in the progress she has made has been marked by iegislation 
that shortened work hours, restricted the employment of chil- 
dren and provided for public education. W. H. Dawson, in his 
book on “The Evolution of Modern Germany,” while discussing 
the great expansion in the textile trades of that country, says 
“the mere figures of persons employed would be misleading 
unless allowance were made for the altered conditions of pro- 
duction, which have operated in Germany as in Great Britain— 
larger looms, improved machinery of all kinds, speeding up and 
other contrivances for increasing production, and not least, 
the raising of the factory age for children.” 
The Federal Government recently published the report of its 
investigation into the condition of woman and child wage- 
earners in the cotton textile industry of the United States. 
Its agents did not visit all the establishments of this industry 
in the country by any means, but in 152 cotton mills in six 
Southern States they found alinost ten thousand boys and girls 
under 16 years at work, or 20 per cent of all the employes of 
these establishments. The census of manufactures of 1905 
showed that the cotton industry employed more children than 
any other four manufacturing industries combined. The ten- 
dency of the Southern mills is to manufacture coarse goods, 
the New England mills fine goods. While children may be 
profitably employed in spinning coarse yarn, they cease to be 
profitable on fine, because of the greater skill required. Hence 
the widespread demand for child labor in the South, labor 
which is essentially cheap and unskilled. The government 
agents found 560 little boys and 389 little girls at work in the 
Southern cotton mills who were proved to be under 12 years 
of age. And the report says that beyond question there were 
many more. One child was only 6 years old, the others were 
F, 8,9, 10 and 11. «In addition to this thousand of littlé 
ones, they found 1,394 children who were only 12 years 
old, and nearly two thousand who were 13. And think 
of the long hours these little ones are kept at work! 
The average hours for the Southern mills is from 60 to 
64 per week. One overseer was found who gave the children
-P-A-G-E-191
   
            
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 191 
10 cents a piece per week for beginning 20 minutes before the 
regular time at noon daily; another who paid them 5 cents a 
week for working six hours overtime. Twenty-six mills fre- 
quently required their employes to work overtime. In 31 estab- 
lishments children under 16 years were found working at night, 
and in 14 of these mills children under 12 years were working 
11 and 12 hours at night for five nights in the week, some of 
them as young as 8 years! What will be the ruin wrought 
upon these little ones by the exhaustion of fatigue? The report 
describes one of these children under 12 years as “an emaciated 
little elf, 50 inches high and weighing perhaps 48 pounds, who 
works from 6 at night till 6 in the morning, and who is so 
tiny that she has to climb up on the spinning frame to reach 
the top row of spindles.” The report adds, rather laconically, 
“mothers complain that the children who work at night are 
nervous.” 
The percentages of illiteracy of children 10 to 14 years of 
age in some Southern States are nearly as high as, and in two 
States are actually higher than, those of the total white popu- 
lation in those States. This does not mean that the schools 
have not improved; “it is rather an evidence that the children 
have not availed themselves of such advantages as the schools 
offer, and this view is borne out by the high percentage of 
child labor as shown in this report and by the statistics of 
the school attendance of illiterate children.” The government 
agents did not, of course, include all the working children 
in their investigation; they gathered data concerning the 
literacy of 1,311 children 6 to 13 years of age whom they found 
at work in Southern cotton mills. Of these, 273 had never 
attended school; the others had attended for an average of 
14 months; 43 per cent were able to read and write, while 52 
per cent were illiterate. Those who had attended school had 
averaged more months of work thay of school attendance, and 
this was found to be true of every Southern State included in 
the study. Bear in mind that these figures do not relate to 
negroes nor to foreigners—for practically all of the operatives 
in the cotton mills of the South are white, native-born of native 
parents. Compulsory education is needed not only to help in 
keeping young children out of the mills and factories, but also 
to oblige the parents to send them to school wutil they have   
-P-A-G-E-192
  192 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
attained to the proper age for employment in industry. Many 
parents are indifferent, some even hostile, toward the school, 
and compulsion by the State is the only means by which their 
children may acquire the rudiments of an education. The goy- 
ernment agents visited 1,567 families in the South and found 
that a large proportion of their children from 6 to 11 years of 
age, who were not at work and for whom school was available, 
were not attending school, but were remaining at home for no 
good reason whatever—spending their most important school 
years in idleness, shiftlessly passing the time. It is sometimes 
argued that the mill children have better educational advan- 
tages than the children on the farms, on account of the good 
schools which the mill owners help to maintain in the mill 
villages. This is true in many instances, but in addition to 
the indifference of parents, the great difficulty is that the mill 
owners regard the pupils as a reserve supply of labor, ready 
for use in any emergency and at a moment’s notice. The gov- 
ernment report says: : 
“Some of the mill owners visited in the South who build schools 
for their employes often permit their superintendents to empty them. 
The school work of the child from 12 to 16 years of age is frequently 
interrupted by a hurry call from the mill superintendent.” “The records 
at a number of schools at both large and small mills showed that in 
the large majority of cases the enrollment of children decreased rapidly 
as the higher grades were reached, the decrease corresponding very 
strikingly with their reaching the age of serviceability in the mills. 
Such a decrease in enrollment is a thing common to schools everywhere, 
but in the cotton mill schools the percentage which those who dropped 
out bore to the total enrollment was greater, and the dropping out 
process began much earlier in the course than it does in other sec- 
tions. . . . Average attendance falls very low in the cotton mill 
school from a number of causes. These are the unattractiveness of 
the school, the inefficient teaching, the lack of mechanical aids to 
instruction, the physical discomforts of the school and the irksomeness 
of school work. . . . The situation at the large mill school is a 
little better than at the small mill school, but not much. Indifference, 
absenteeism, insubordination, lack of equipment, interference from the 
mill and about everything else that can defeat a teacher’s efforts, she 
has to contend against. She finds every interest of the school subor- 
dinated to the needs of the mill. With little or no local public senti- 
ment back of her, she can do practically nothing to remedy the con- 
ditions. . . . The early age at which children may become wage- 
earners in the mill tends to make parents start them in school very 
early. . . . Poverty and the generally low earning capacity of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 193 
mill people, who get lower wages than the people in almost any other 
great industry, are among the prime causes of the indifference and hos- 
tility of the parents toward the schools. They say they had no educa- 
tion themselves, and their children can get along without it; that since 
they supported the children when they were very small, they should 
now help to support themselves; that school regulations are curtail- 
ments of their personal liberties—such requirements as that children 
shall be vaccinated and come to school properly dressed and clean, 
they regard as enough to condemn the whole school system as undemo- 
cratic; and the parents say that the man who rents a house of the 
cotton mill company is required to furnish on an average one worker 
for each room in the house when it has more than two. The house 
was built to shelter a required number, not of persons but of workers, 
and must serve that original purpose. The pressure on the parents 
to supplement the labor supply is none the less weighty because indirect 
or couched in terms that do not openly suggest taking the children 
out of school.” 
But the cotton mill is not the only institution that exploits 
child labor in the South. A line of canning factories stretches 
along the Gulf Coast from Florida to Louisiana, and all of 
them employ little children. Our own agent found 125 boys and 
girls working in them, whom he judged to be from 3 to 11 
years of age. It is not at all a rare sight to see 4 and 5-year- 
old children struggling with the rough, heavy shells, shucking 
oysters, and in the course of the day earning about five cents. 
Seven and 8-year-old children earn from 10 to 25 cents, while 
one 11-year-old girls was earning $1 a day when the shrimp 
were large. When the children become too tired to work they 
tend the baby, for often the whole family stays in the cannery 
shed all day. An active little girl of 8 years said, “I shucks 
six pots a day when I don’t got the baby wid me, an’ two 
pots if I got him.” The work day begins usually at 3 o’clock 
in the morning. Some of children work from 8 or 4 a. M. 
until school time and also on Saturdays; others are in the 
cannery all day until quitting time, which is 4 p. m. In can- 
ning shrimp a corrosive substance attacks the fingers of the 
pickers and it is not possible for them to work much more than 
six hours. It is not uncommon to find the children with 
swollen and bleeding fingers, but still keeping bravely at it. 
In the evening they harden the fingers in a solution of alum 
to prepare for the next day’s work. One mother said her small 
boy went to school when he wasn’t working. 
13

    In the eternal unfitness of things many of these families 
revolve in a vicious circle of industrial exploitation, for they 
spend the winter season along the Gulf working in the can- 
neries, and then are shipped north to pass the summer laboring 
in the berry fields, the truck gardens and vegetable canneries 
of New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland. Aside from the lack 
of opportunity for proper recreation, many of these children are 
growing up in ignorance and the others get but meagre educa- 
tion. It is the plain duty of the States to pass such laws and 
to make provision as will prevent the premature labor of chil- 
dren in this and all other gainful occupations, and oblige them 
to attend school until they are at least 14 years of age. 
Our newly-awakened social conscience has decreed that child 
labor must be abolished. It is an evil that affects us all very 
closely, for it strikes at the very foundation of things, what 
we regard as most sacred of all—the family. The family is 
the recognized unit of our civilization; whatever attacks the 
integrity of the family undermines our civilization and impels 
the social structure to its fall. There are many agencies that 
weaken the influence of the home and break the tie that binds, 
and of these the premature employment of children ranks among 
the most effective. A child’s spirit of independence normally 
reaches its full development upon his arrival at years of dis- 
cretion, and then the time is ripe for him to withdraw from 
the shelter and protection his parents afford and to take his 
place in the great scheme of society, supported by the ideals 
that home has instilled into his soul and strengthened by the 
discipline and training that were his in childhood and in youth. 
But if this spirit of independence is developed at too early an 
age, as is the case when a child becomes a wage-earner, parental 
authority is disregarded, the relationship between parent and 
child is thereby weakened and the disintegration of the home 
begins. We provide juvenile courts, probation officers and 
reformatory schools, all of them necessary, but having to deal 
only with the effect; we do not make sufficient provision to 
remove one of the principal causes of juvenile delinquency, 
which, as one of the reports of the federal investigation con- 
clusively proves, is child labor. As Judge Ben Lindsey, of 
Denver, says: “This report completely explodes the idea that 
the working boy and girl under 16 years of age is freer from
-P-A-G-E-195
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 195 
the dangers of delinquency than the non-working child. One 
of the main conclusions of the report is that putting children 
to work prematurely is not an effective method of training 
them for good citizenship.” This simply serves to show that we 
must put forth every effort to the end that our American chil- 
dren shall be protected, nurtured and educated, for this is our 
duty not only to the children, but also to the nation and to 
society. 
Compulsory education and the restriction of child labor form 
the principal part of the program for the training and pro- 
tection of children in nearly every State of the Union. These 
two elements of the great constructive plan for child welfare 
are complementary, and to ensure the successful operation of 
the whole program the close relationship of the one to the other 
must be recognized. The full benefit of compulsory education 
cannot be realized if young children are allowed freely to 
engage in gainful occupations during the hours in which the 
public schools are not in session; neither will the opportunity 
for education, which the State seeks to grant through the 
prevention of child labor, be fully taken advantage of unless 
attendance at school is required. Physical strain from excess 
of work defeats the aim of the State in the one case, while the 
evil effects of idleness are the consequence in the other. 
Whenever the enactment of compulsory education and child 
labor laws are urged for the benefit of children under 14 years, 
the employers of child labor and their satellites at once con- 
jure up the spectre of the poor widow who is dependent upon 
the earnings of her young offspring, and they paint for us an 
appalling scene of desolation which they assert would be the 
inevitable consequence of the passage of such laws. From the 
experience of social workers in listening to these claims it 
would seem that the population of the United States consisted 
largely of widows and orphans, and that the labor of little chil- 
dren was absolutely indispensable in order to maintain many 
of our industries and to keep countless families out of the 
poorhouse. The persistence of such claims is merely a reflec- 
tion on the intelligence and good judgment of the American 
people. There is no such widespread dependence as the em- 
ployers would have us believe. The Federal Government’s 
report on child labor in the cotton textile industry shows that 
   
-P-A-G-E-196
  196 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  of the 1,428 children under 14 years of age at work in Southern 
mills whose family condition was ascertained, over 67 per cent 
had their fathers but not their mothers at work, 6 per cent had 
both parents at work, 3 per cent had idle fathers, 4 per cent 
had disabled fathers, 6 per cent had mothers who had been 
deserted and 14 per cent had widowed mothers. Consequently, 
76 per cent of these little breadwinners had both parents living 
and able to work and support and educate them, while only 
24 per cent were the children of incapacitated fathers and of 
deserted and widowed mothers, all combined. There are many 
other and similar proofs of the fallacy of the poor widow argu- 
ment as a justification for child labor. 
This mark of sympathy for the tiny orphans shown by the 
employers by taking them into their mills and factories to 
work ten and eleven hours a day reminds one of Lanigan’s fable 
about the “kind-hearted she-elephant.” An elephant, while 
stamping through the jungle one day, quite unintentionally 
stepped upon a mother bird, crushing it to death. Hearing 
ihe cries of the little brood in the bushes near by, she sought 
out the nest, and with a sympathetic sigh said, “Poor little 
things! I’ve been a mother myself, I'l] keep you warm,” and 
proceeded to sit upon the nest. 
If our civilization is to continue and to improve with time, 
every child must have a proper opportunity to grow under con- 
ditions as nearly normal as possible, and the child who needs 
to have such an opportunity created for him is the very one 
whom the thoughtless would further oppress by sanctioning 
his labor at a premature age—the very one who is already 
weighed down by the misfortune of orphanage and poverty, the 
very one who needs most this chance to grow. 
The figures in the Federal Government’s report are perhaps 
most significant in showing the need of enlightened public 
opinion in regard to these matters, that will insist upon the 
improvement of conditions. To think that more than three- 
fourths of the little children under 14 years at work in the 
Southern cotton mills had both parents living and able to work! 
The church would render a great service to society if it would 
instill into the minds and hearts of these misguided parents the 
truth of the old saying in the book of Corinthians, “For the 
children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents
-P-A-G-E-197
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 197 
for the children.” And if it should be said that wages are 
low and the father alone cannot support the family, and that 
an increase in wages would drive the industry out of business, 
1 would answer in the words of Emerson: “I would not have 
the laborer sacrificed to the result. I would not have the laborer 
sacrificed to my convenience and pride, nor to that of a great 
class of such as me. Let there be worse cotton and better men. 
The weaver should not be bereaved of his superiority to his 
work.” 
In the study of the situation, I am reminded of an incident 
that occurred some centuries before the Christian era in a 
country called Shunem. A little boy was out in a field near 
his home one morning, where the harvesters were at work, and 
complained to his father of a pain in his head. The child was 
carried back to his mother, who held him in her lap until noon, 
when he died. The mother laid the lifeless body upon a bed 
and went in search of a certain man of God called Elisha, who, 
when he saw the woman approaching, asked her, “Is it well 
with the child?” Upon learning the cause of the mother’s 
grief, Elisha went to the stricken home and worked with the 
dead child until its flesh waxed warm, and life was brought 
back, when he gave it alive and well to the mother and went 
his way. Nearly 3,000 years have elapsed since that event, but 
today there are thousands of little children in our own land, 
whose future is dead because of the apathy of the State, chil- 
dren in whom no end of serviceable talents lie dormant because 
of the lack of a chance to develop through protection and edu- 
cation. Our Legislatures must realize this situation and ask 
the question, “Is it well with the child?” And having learned 
the truth, they must work with the problem until it is solved 
and the children are restored to their mother, the State, in full 
possession of childhood’s birthright of the chance to prepare for 
a useful life and intelligent citizenship. (Great applause.) 
At the close of the reading of this paper, a member called 
attention to the great value and importance of this address, 
and suggested that the two local papers be asked to publish it 
in full if possible. 
Thereupon, the Chair declared the meeting closed.

The program was preceded by a well-rendered selection by 
a chorus of High School boys and girls under the direction of 
the Musical Director of Houston Schools. 
The Chair introduced as the first speaker, Dr. E. O. Holland, 
Superintendent of Schools of Lexington, Kentucky. Dr. Hol- 
land had been set down upon the program for Friday fore- 
noon, but owing to a misunderstanding as to place of meeting, 
had arrived at the theater not until the time for adjournment. 
He presented the following paper upon 
THE EDUCATION OF THE FACTORY CHILD. 
E. 0. HOLLAND, LEXINGTON, KY. 
According to Doctor Cubberley in his “Changing Conceptions 
of Education,” in 1790 there were in the United States but 
six cities with a population of over 8,000 inhabitants, represent- 
ing but 3 4-10ths per cents of the total population. In 1900 
there were 545 cities in the United States with a population 
of 8,000 or more, representing 33 1-10th per cent of the entire 
population of the country. With the enormous increase in 
urban population has come a demand for a different prepara- 
tion for the work of the city, the factories, the shops and the 
whole commercial life of the country.. 
In the meantime, a most profound change has affected both 
the home and the church. No longer do the main educational 
agencies center in the home, and many contend that the church 
is no longer the great inspirational force it used to be in the 
realms of religion and ethics. Those of us who work in cities 
realize that there is a profound need for a change in our educa- 
tional aims and methods. 
In most States the compulsory education law holds the child 
until the age of 14, sometimes to the age of 16, but we know 
that this school-leaving age is too young. And as a great Ger- 
man educator has put it, “The premature release from school 
 
-P-A-G-E-199
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 199 
discipline means for most pupils a complete cessation of all 
systematic education, and this cessation occurs at an age when 
the demoralizing influences of an uncontrolled life may have 
the most baleful effect on the budding moral character.” If 
this assertion is half true, how can the American people permit 
thousands of Southern children from 8 to 12 years of age to 
labor from 10 to 14 hours a day in the factories and cotton 
mills? 
Doctor David Snedden, Commissioner of Education in Massa- 
chusetts, has stated it thus: “It has been pointed out in the 
report of the Douglas Commission (of Massachusetts) as well 
as elsewhere that the period from 14 to 16 is a critical one in 
the vocational development of large numbers of children. This 
is the period when economic necessity or ambition tempts chil- 
dren into callings which are temporarily quite remunerative 
(for children), but which are essentially non-educative. The 
outcome is the unskilled worker.” 
John Spargo has stated the same thing in a somewhat 
different way: “The child who is forced to be a man too soon, 
forced too early to enter ihe industrial strife of the world, ceases 
to be a man too soon, ceases to be fit for the industrial strife. 
Ruskin’s words are profoundly true, that ‘to be a man 
too soon is to be a small man.’ ” 
In the United States in 1900, according to the census, 1,752,- 
187 children under 16 years of age were employed in gainful 
occupations. Such a vast army of little ones, whose future 
is in jeopardy, cannot be ignored. In many respects this is the 
most important educational and social problem that is pre- 
senting itself for solution today. Where have we been com- 
pelled to turn for guidance in meeting this difficult question? 
As in many other things, we find that the German people have 
come more nearly than any other civilized nation to solving 
their industrial problem. Let us consider the progressive Ger- 
man empire for a moment. A giant hand could take up the 
German empire and one-half of the State of Kentucky and 
find room for this territory in the single State of Texas. In 
our entire country we have at present but eighty-five millions 
of people, while the German empire has today a population of 
sixty-five million, with an annual increase of 750,000 a year. 
The natural resources of the German empire do not compare   
 
-P-A-G-E-200
    200 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
with those of this country, and yet we find less of pauperism 
and crime and lawlessness in this monarchy than can be found 
in almost any other civilized country. 
A few years ago, S. S. McClure, the author and publisher, 
discovered that in the city of Chicago there were four times 
as many murders committed each year as in Berlin, a city of 
the same size. He further discovered that there are four times 
as many convictions for murder in Berlin as there are in 
Chicago. A recent article in Collier’s Weekly shows that there 
are but ten murders annually to every million inhabitants in 
Germany ; in the United States there are eighty-five murders to 
every million inhabitants. Obedience to the law and a deep 
respect for human life are direct carollaries to an efficient school 
system such as Germany has had for nearly a century. 
The story is told that a number of years ago, the Ear! of 
Shaftesbury took the famous Arnold of Rugby to the East 
Side of London, where thousands of people live in want and 
squalor and misery, and where both lawlessness and disease 
are rampant. These two spent nearly the entire night going 
from hovel to hovel, and as they proceeded, the famous school- 
master could hardly believe that they were walking through 
the streets of the largest and wealthiest city in his own country, 
for until then he could not believe that civilization was able 
to produce and tolerate such misery. As he and Shaftesbury 
were leaving the district as the early morning dawn was break 
ing, he turned to Shaftesbury and said: “Many years ago the 
vandals or Goths of Northern Europe swept down and destroyed 
the civilization of Italy. If we Englishmen do not take thought 
of these thousands of workers, another horde here in our own 
midst will rise up and destroy all that our civilization holds 
sacred. We can no longer ignore these poor helpless beings 
as they have been ignored in the past.” 
And yet the conditions that Arnold and Shaftesbury saw 
in the London East Side were in many respects no worse than 
what we can find in many of the larger cities of this country, 
and no worse than many of the conditions that are bound to 
arise in many of our Southern cities where the factories are 
springing up by the score. Spargo states that from 1880 to 
1900 the value of Southern manufactures increased from less 
than $452,000,000 to $1,463,000,000—an increase of 320 per 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 201 
cent. According to one expert, this growth was due “chiefly 
to her supply of tractable and cheap labor.” 
A few years ago I had an opportunity to inspect the Elmira 
reformatory and examine the classes of young men who were 
confined in that institution. I discovered that 58 per cent 
of the 1,600 young men in that reformatory came from the 
single borough of Manhattan, and that 73 per cent were from 
the city of New York. At once you might imagine that this 
large percentage from New York City was mainly composed 
of foreigners who were not able to adjust themselves to the 
conditions in a great city. But this is the very thing I did not 
discover. In fact, I discovered that practically all of these 
young men were American born, though it is true that most of 
them were of foreign-born parentage. 
You will agree, however, that many of these young delin- 
quents were the product of city life, rather than of social and 
economic conditions in the home itself. This maladjustment of 
social and economic conditions which develop hundreds of crim- 
inals each year in the single city of New York, was more largely 
due to inadequate city administration and unsuitable educa- 
tional opportunities, than to indifference on the part of the 
parents who had come to this country from foreign lands. 
We must learn that it does not pay to permit either parent 
or city prematurely to exploit childhood. In the end the family 
and the city will suffer, and the State eventually will be dis- 
rupted. If we believe that self-preservation on the part of the 
State is of first consideration, we then may proceed to a con- 
sideration of how to meet this problem. 
Experiments in Germany looking toward a different curri- 
culum for the children who must work in the factory, the store 
and one the farm, have been eminently successful. The Director 
of the Public Schools in Munich, Doctor Kerschensteiner, has 
developed a type of school which is considered in many respects 
the model for both Europe and the United States. Doctor 
Kerschensteiner states that the first aim of education for those 
leaving the primary school is the “development of trade effi- 
ciency and love of work, and with this, the development of those 
elementary virtues which effectiveness of effort and love of work 
immediately call forth—conscientiousness, diligence, persever- 
ance, responsibility, self-restraint and dedication to a strenuous 
life.”
-P-A-G-E-202

  “Tn close connection with this,” he states, “the second aim 
must be pursued; to gain an insight into the relations of indi- 
viduals to one another and to the State; to understand the laws 
of health, and to employ the knowledge acquired in the exercise 
of self-control, justice and devotion to duty, and in leading a 
sensible life, tempered with a strong feeling of personal respon- 
sibility.” 
Have the educators in the United States developed a primary 
school system that fulfills these aims in the education of the 
factory child? The answer is an emphatic negative. 
First of all, the older type of night school which is to be 
found in many of the larger cities of this country, has failed 
to add materially to the equipment of the factory folk who are 
growing so rapidly in numbers. In the main, their work has 
been negative rather than positive, and, as a consequence, only 
a very small percentage of the boys and girls attending this 
type of night school in American cities has been able to com- 
plete the work. 
In a few places, the splendid work of the continuation schools 
in Germany has been imitated in this country. Some splendid 
experiments have been tried recently under the direction of the 
University of Wisconsin in the work shops and factories of 
Milwaukee and Beaver Dam. Very recently vocational and 
continuation schools have been established in various parts of 
Massachusetts, where there is great need for such schools, since 
thirty thousands of boys and girls leave the common schools 
‘each year at the age of 14 to take up some trade. 
Recently the University of Cincinnati and the public schools 
of that city have worked together to solve this very important 
juvenile and industrial problem. After some experimentation 
had been carried on under private initiative, conferences were 
called between the leading manufacturers and the Board of 
Education, and the whole question of vocational education was 
discussed in detail. Finally, it was agreed that the city was 
to provide the necessary teachers and the proper equipment for 
a school of industrial education. At the same time, the manu- 
facturers pledged themselves to send a sufficient number of 
apprentices to justify the city in establishing and maintaining 
such a school. This school was opened in September, 1909, and 
has paid for itself in many ways. 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 203 
Since that time, according to the statements made by the 
city officials, the attendance in this school averages at this time 
about 200 a week. The boys come in groups of about twenty 
each, and remain for half a day or for four hours each week. 
The employers of these boys pay them their usual wages for 
attendance. When the boys return to the shops for their regu- 
lar work they are questioned by the workmen and foremen, in 
order that the lessons in the school can be understood and 
applied to the definite work of the shop. Many of the older 
workmen have become interested in this vocational work and, 
as a consequence, many of them attend night school, where 
definite instruction is given and various shop problems dis- 
cussed. 
This experiment, which has been eminently successful, is 
similar to what has been tried with such eminent success in 
many of the industrial centers of Germany, and it will not be 
long before other cities will awaken to the needs of the factory 
boy and girl. In imitating the continuation schools of Ger- 
many still further, a part of each day is given to general cul- 
ture and to talks on hygiene and civics. 
Such continuation schools should be in every city. They 
should have the direction of all working children between the 
ages of 14 and 16. For some time, because of the economic con- 
dition in many families, it will be impossible for the city or the 
State to monopolize the time of the child from 14 to 16. It is 
likely that a compromise will have to be effected, and during 
these two years only from 4 to 8 hours of each week required 
of the child. If this much time can be given to continuation 
work, expert industrial training can be furnished the boys and 
girls upon whom the economic demands are already pressing 
heavily. At the same time they can be instructed in hygiene 
and civics, so that they will know how to become better citi- 
zens. Besides, the voluntary movements among the young 
workers in our various industries should be encouraged. They 
should feel that they belong to a large organization, which 
must work together for a better industrial and social condition 
of the entire working class. Finally, technical schools should be 
established in every city, and the teaching done by skilled work- 
men and the most expert teachers that can be found. 
In the past the natural wealth of this country has been so
-P-A-G-E-204
  204 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
bountiful that we have easily met the competition of the indus- 
trial classes in other countries. But much of this natural 
wealth has been consumed, and, sad to say, much more has 
been wasted. As a consequence, if we are to maintain our 
position of commercial supremacy, we must see that the work- 
ing class is reinforced by young people who are splendidly 
equipped and more intelligent and better protected than were 
their fathers from any dangers of exploitation on the part of 
the manufacturer. 
The commercial and industrial supremacy of this country 
demands this; moreover, our democracy depends upon it. We 
must have a working class that is intelligent, that has industrial 
skill and is not lacking in steadiness and sobriety. A democ- 
racy standing upon any other industrial organization will fail, 
as will the sanctity of the home, when these qualities are lacking 
among the industrial classes of this country. Certainly it 
can be said that the primary school, established at the begin- 
ning of the nineteenth century, no longer adequately meets 
+he requirements of society at the beginning of the twentieth, 
when economic, social and political conditions have completely 
changed. 
As Jane Addams has stated in her wonderful book, entitled 
“The Spirit of Youth and the City Streets:” “We may either 
smother the divine fire of youth or we may feed it. We may 
either stand stupidly staring as it sinks into a murky fire of 
crime and flares into the intermittent blaze of folly, or we 
may tend it into a lambant flame with power to make clean 
and bright our dingy city streets.” 
If today one of us should see a man on the streets of Houston 
beating a child or mistreating even a donkey or a horse, we 
would protest and interfere. Yet, we are willing to permit the 
exploitation of the Southern boys and girls in the factories 
and mills and shops of our Southern States. We are willing to 
permit these children to be enslaved even before the adoles- 
cent period, and this means that they will never become strong, 
vigorous men or women, or be able to enjoy to the fulk the 
civilization of which we are so proud. The beating of a child on 
the streets of Houston, from which the child may recover within 
a few hours or a few days, cannot be compared with the irre- 
parable injury done to the same child by permitting ignorant
-P-A-G-E-205
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 205 
  parents to sell the very body and soul of that child for a few 
paltry dollars. 
Germany has found that from the financial standpoint the 
exploitation of childhood is indefensible. The philanthropists 
and educators of the country have raised their protests from 
the standpoint of social and moral progress, and our democracy 
will not much longer endure such a terrible violation of the 
rights of our children. Certainly our economic progress cannot 
continue unless we are able to develop skillful and intelligent 
workmen as does Germany and other European countries. 
Let us go back to our homes and lend our aid against the 
folly and the injustice of exploiting childhood in the Southern 
factories. Let us interest the leading men of our community— 
the ministers, the editors, the doctors, the lawyers and the labor- 
ing men—in this great question. Have them comprehend what 
frightful toll inevitably comes from compelling a child to take 
up the burden of the adult. Let the religious forces of your 
community understand that the saving of souls is not possible if 
the body is broken in the terrible grind of factory toil. Let 
us wage a campaign for the children of the South. Let us 
demand that those children be given the same opportunities in 
the way of thorough economic preparation and higher concep- 
tions of civic duty that are given to the child of the German 
laborer. The social, economic and political future of this coun- 
try demands that the exploitation of youth be discontinued. 
Many years ago a famous artist looked out upon a field and 
saw there a dull-minded, broken-hearted man toiling with his 
hoe; and in his imagination he saw back of this toiler the 
injustice that had come upon the individual and the thousands 
of his brothers who had been held in the ranks of serfdom. 
His picture has aroused the sympathy of the world. It has 
done its part with Rousseau and the other social leaders in 
the awakening of public conscience to a realization of such 
injustice. Those of us who are engaged in educational work 
should understand that we also can do our part in arousing 
the public to adopt effective measures for the protection of 
the children of the South.

THE EDUCATION OF THE MOUNTAIN CHILD. 
J. T. C. NOE, LEXINGTON, KY. 
  All writers on education in recent years have defined educa- 
tion as a process of adjustment. .I consider it a rather fortunate 
thing for the future generations that we have at last arrived 
at this conception of the educative process. Just how long 
it will take us to adjust ourselves to this definition cannot with 
any degree of certainty be predicted. Methods and courses 
of study are in the end conditioned, if not absolutely deter- 
mined, by the goals we are aiming to reach, by the ideals we 
set for ourselves. If this statement needed proof, it could easily 
be found in the pages of the history of education. The fact, 
then, that we have reached the conception of adjustment as an 
aim in education, means in the end that we shall shape our 
courses of study to reach the aim. We must admit, however, 
that this ideal has not, at present, influenced the educative 
process in this country to any appreciable degree. Many educa- 
tors who are fond of quoting President Butler on occasion, and 
who read O’Shea with approval, often most bitterly oppose any 
change in our ancient course of study, and I sometimes think 
would plunge our country into a bloody war before they would 
give up educational practices as manifestly useless and unpsy- 
chological as the old-fashioned spelling “bee.” 
I want to discuss the education of the mountain child as a 
process of adjustment. It is high time that here in the moun- 
tains, at least, our definition were taking form in method 
and content of the course. You will not be surprised when I 
tell you that I have sat in a little log schoolhouse in the Ken- 
tucky mountains, within hearing distance of a mine and lumber 
mill and heard boys, who could not speak a sentence of choice 
English, draw] out to the accompaniment of a coal tipple and 
a steam planing mill, “Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres,” 
while a Northern corporation was dividing their own moun- 
tains and valleys into only two parts, and hauling both parts 
away to a foreign market over a railroad owned by a foreign 
   
-P-A-G-E-207
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 207 
  corporation. I believe in history. I believe in letting in the 
light in education. I am fond of considering education as a 
process of tearing down the walls of darkness and letting in 
the light of history and literature. I can see no reason why 
the mountain boy should remain ignorant of ancient Gaul and 
the fate of Aeneas, so long as the son of the plains is going 
around quoting Caesar in oratio obliqua and Virgil in high- 
sounding hexameters. But how we can adjust this conception 
of education to our definition of adjustment is more than I can 
tell. It is true that Greek no longer holds the mountain passes 
against the ambitious young mountaineer. But it has been only 
a half generation since the son of Atreus and god-like Achilles 
stood athwart his path and demanded that he listen to their 
quarrel that sent so many valiant souls to Pluto’s gloomy reign. 
May we not hope that another generation will drive Caesar back 
across the Rubicon and free the world once more? Not so. 
For every mountaineer hereafter must know the story of 
William Tell. Was he not a mountaineer himself? And how 
delightful to hear that story told in Schiller’s guttural tongue! 
Adjustment, indeed! How long will it take at our present 
rate of travel to reach the goal? 
Oh, but you say, the mountaineer needs only an elementary 
education, and you are discussing high school work. How about 
geography? Is there any more adjustment in the methods and 
aims of geography as this subject is now taught in the moun- 
tains, and elsewhere, for that matter, than there was when 
Xenephon was marching so many parasangs a day with the 
immortal ten thousand through every mountain pass? Even 
the education of the Chinese is as near to a process of adjust- 
ment as is our own formal and conventional teaching. For only 
the Chinaman who can master the four books and five classics 
can reach the highest position in the civil service, and their 
education is, therefore, a form of adjustment—a means to an 
end. But what can be the value of learning the names of all 
the rivers and mountains of Afghanistan and India? Will 
such knowledge ever function? And capes! My early experience 
with geography was one long nightmare of capes and coast 
lines. Even in my sleep I seemed sailing on a harborless sea, 
always in sight of shore, but ever in imminent danger of being 
wrecked on some projecting cape. Now I have forgotten the
-P-A-G-E-208
208 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  name of every cape in the whole round world. I have still 
a vague memory that the Penobscot River is somewhere in the 
State of Maine, but I have never had the pleasure of a sail on 
its placid waters (or turbid, as the case may be). And this is 
geography as it is taught. And yet geography properly taught 
would put much meaning into our modern definition of the 
educative process. How comprehensive is geography! Practi- 
cally everything that the mountaineer needs to know of his 
mountain land with its buried treasures could be learned 
through a proper study of geography. 
What an opportunity for the teacher in the lesson of con- 
servation of timber and timber land, though I fear it comes a 
bit too tardy for the conservation of Kentucky forests. Enough 
trees to timber the hanging gardens of Babylon have floated 
down the Cumberland and Kentucky Rivers with every freshet 
in the last twenty years. And probably as much more has been 
destroyed by fire. Ignorance of geography, more than anything 
else, is responsible for the great loss to the people of the Ken- 
tucky mountains. Oh, they have all had geography, i.e., all who 
have had anything taught them in the schools. But the schools. 
were dealing with capitals and gulfs and bays, and learning 
the names of volcanoes in Mexico; and while students and 
teachers were thinking of the great rivers of lava flowing out 
of Mexican craters, they were blind to the rivers of wealth 
flowing out of the bowels of their native mountain peaks into 
the coffers of foreign corporations. All this, because education 
in the mountains has never meant adjustment. A1I this, because 
education stil] remains formal and conventional. All this, 
because writers of history have described battles and sieges 
and exalted military heroes, rather than discussed industrial 
and social life. I once heard an examiner ridicule domestic 
science and manual training and agriculture as silly subjects 
for a course of study in school—an examiner who that day 
refused certificates to several intelligent applicants because of 
their inability to solve some crazy problems in annual interest 
and compound proportion. 
If education means adjustment, why should not elementary 
courses in political science and sociology, something more than 
is now comprehended in civil government, be put into our 
schools of the people, for the people, and by the people? Surely 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 209 
we have sufficient data upon which to base some principles of 
right living. In fact, does not our whole course of study need 
readjustment? 
The first step, I think, that should be taken toward the educa- 
tion of the mountain child is a readjustment of methods and 
courses to meet the modern aims in education. Education for 
the mountain child means that reading, writing and spelling, 
arithmetic and geography shall be made practical—shall be so 
taught that they will become a means in the hands of the child 
for future adjustment. In order that this may come to pass, 
arithmetic must be made more simple and more concrete, and 
we must await a later period of maturity and the attainment 
of much leisure for the solution of arithmetical puzzles. Geog- 
raphy must become an elementary science and contribute to 
the solution of many practical problems that lie at the door of 
the mountain child, instead of being a game of tit-tat-too on a 
mariner’s chart or civil engineer’s map. Education for the 
mountain child means that he shall be early brought to an 
appreciation of good language as it is revealed in good litera- 
ture, and not be put to parsing such sentences as, 
“The swan on still St. Mary’s Lake 
Float double swan and shadow,” 
before he is out of his intellectual swaddling clothes. It means 
that some practical lessons in sanitation shall take the place 
of the number of bones in the human body; that the rights 
and duties of citizenship be taught in connection with our 
country’s history and government; that social, economic and 
industrial questions be discussed and become as familiar to 
the child as rules in cube-root and alligation; that a knowledge 
of the soil and its productivity, of food values, of stock-raising, 
poultry culture and the science of cookery, take the place of 
many impractical things now receiving attention. But in order 
to accomplish even a part of these reforms, more than a mere 
readjustment of methods and courses of study is necessary. 
Thousands of teachers must be prepared to accomplish this 
work. Those now teaching have fed too long on the crumbs 
from the conventional table and in turn can give only a portion 
of those crumbs to the starving multitudes of children. To do 
this work, to bring about these reforms, if they are reforms, 
teachers must be instructed in subject-matter, and trained in 
14

method as well. By method I do not mean, of course, devices 
and schemes and outlines and moving picture paraphernalia. 
Heaven forbid! I mean a knowledge of aims and values, of 
psychological principles, of sane and logical procedure. Meihod- 
itis is a disease that needs the surgeon’s knife quite as often as 
does the vermiform appendix. Teachers must be professionaily 
trained, but methods is not the chief business of the profes- 
sional schools. That business is to rationalize the teaching 
process, to give clear understanding to fundamentals, a scien- 
tific knowledge of values. Give the mountains an army of 
teachers thus trained and educated, and every cove and moun- 
tainside will become fragrant with peach and apple blossoms, 
even as they are now odorous with the bloom of rhododendron ; 
and the happy hum of industry will rival the song of the thrush 
and red-bird in mountain, glen and steep defile. 
But the education of the mountain child should not stop 
here. He has as much capacity for higher learning and scien- 
tific philosophic training as the child that runs the streets or 
follows. the plow in the lowlands. Education for citizenship, 
social efficiency, is our aim, and this means adjustment, of 
course, to conditions that lie around about us. But adjustment 
means progress as well as adaptation, the moulding and shaping 
of environment, and not mere submission to physical condi- 
tions. And social efficiency means culture, as well as vocational 
training or technical education. ‘The mountaineer does ueed 
a practical education. He needs knowledge that will enable 
him to live a higher material life than he is now living. But 
he needs more than this—more than knowledge that will enable 
him to meet the daily needs of a stomach that waits on the 
toil of hands. He needs, as much as does any other child, an 
education that leads into the temple of art and nature made 
aesthetic. Why not allow him to sit at the feet of Theocritus 
and Virgil; of Wordsworth and Tennyson; of Homer and 
Sophocles, and Shakespeare and Browning? The only trouble 
in the past has been that the fundamental was the super- 
structure—that the practical, the vocational, the technical was 
unworthy until we had first builded high on Horace and Aris- 
totle. The process must be reversed. Education must be made 
a preparation for life, but not for a material life alone. This 
were a mistake, if not as detrimental to the social whole, far 
more fatal to individual development and progress.

My experience with the Kentucky and Tennessee mountaineer

John Fox, Jr., has, in my opinion, been unjustly criticized by 
those who do not know the facts, for turning a poor, ignorant 
mountain girl of fourteen, who never knew a finer dress than a 
linsey homespun, and purer speech than “I seed and knowed,” 
into a young lady of eighteen, wearing the latest Parisian styles 
in dress, and talking philosophy and literature like a Cambridge 
connoisseur. If John Fox is right, the mountaineer not only 
has capacity for adjustment, but most rapid adjustment. And 
this is the truth. An instance out of my own experience may 
throw some light on the subject. A girl from far back in 
the mountains came to my school at Pineville, Kentucky, about 
ten years ago. She was only seventeen years of age when she 
entered, but she looked every day of twenty-two. She was 
stooped and walked with a shuffling gait. Her face was pinched 
and her countenance haggard. Her dress did not fit her body 
and was at least four inches shorter in front than behind. There 
was only one thing about the girl that did not excite pity, and 
that was her eye. That eye was dark and piercing, and when 
riveted on you had almost hypnotic power. My school had many 
fashionably dressed girls, for Pineville is a town of considerable 
culture. Within a few months the mountain girl from far 
out in the hills had changed from a poorly dressed, awkward, 
self-conscious, diffident, over-worked and consequently almost 
physically deformed girl, into a fashionably dressed, graceful, 
self-possessed, well-formed, beautiful and intelligent young Jady. 
The transformation was nothing short of a miracle enacted 
before my very eyes. Not only that. But within five years 
from that date she held the highest grade teachers’ certificate in 
that county, and was sought after by the best schoois for her 
superior ability as a teacher. Nor is she the only case that I 
could mention. The mountaineer is primitive only because he 
is isolated, shut out from civilization, and not because he has 
not great capacity for achievement. He is childlike even up 
to middle-age. He resembles in a remarkable degree the pre- 
historic Grecian, as depicted by Homer. The mountaineer is 
not lazy, but indolent. He will travel a score of miles on the 
darkest night for a big fat opossum, or dance till the burst of
-P-A-G-E-212
212 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  dawn to the monotonous thrumming of a badly tuned banjo. 
All of this proves that he is not lazy. He lives altogether in 
the present. He must see the immediate results of his labor. 
Fifty cents or one dollar is worth more to him today than a 
hundred dollars will be next year. This is why the moun- 
taineer has sold all his mineral and timber rights for a mess 
of pottage. He cannot look to the future, to remote ends, any 
more than can a child. The business of education is to develop 
capacity for sustained labor that awaits remote results. The 
mountaineer needs to be taught the investment of labor. But 
this connot be given him by precept alone. He must be made 
to see the value of labor. He needs and must have a teacher 
who understands him, a teacher who believes in him, a teacher 
who himself has faith in sustained labor and high purpose, and 
who has an enthusiasm that will inspire the mind, and an 
intelligence that can direct the energies of this plastic son of 
the hills. 
And now, finally, education for the mountains does not mean 
education for the child alone, though that is the subject that 
I am supposed to discuss. It means education for the com- 
munity as well, the adult whose span of infancy is twice that of 
him who is born and bred in the city. I believe in the teacher. 
Teacher ought to mean leader. We must fill the mountains 
with professionally trained, well-endowed, thoroughly edu- 
cated teachers, who will not only instruct the children in bet- 
ter modes of living and more practical knowledge, but who 
will arouse the volitional consciousness of whole communities 
and districts, and direct the energy now expended in hunt and 
dance and frolic toward more remote but far more useful ends. 
This is more easily said than done, but it can be done and is 
now being done in some parts of the Kentucky mountains, as 
one who will follow me in the discussion of the subject is able 
to show you. 
The teachers that go to the mountains must not carry with 
them theory and philosophy alone, but power of demonstration, 
as well. The mountaineer, still in his childhood, learns more 
by imitation than by instruction. I have traveled for more 
than a hundred miles in the mountain section of Kentucky 
where the trimming on every house that contained any paint 
whatever, was painted in the same style, and where a single 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 213 
style of architecture prevailed. Screen one house against the 
deadly fly, and a hundred others will bar the passage to death 
that now stalks unrecognized and unopposed into every moun- 
tain cabin. This is adjustment for the adult population. This 
is fundamental education. We have been too long building 
superstructures without foundation—mere castles in the air. 
Why not put the temple of art and culture in the top story of 
our intellectual sky-scrapers? But I see no reason why sky- 
scrapers should not be erected on the mountain peaks as well 
as in the plains. Still we must keep the useful and practical 
in the valley, where the mountaineer for the most part must 
live and move and have his being, until he is able to climb to 
the mountain tops of culture and poetry, the “Argive heights 
of old philosophy.” (Applause.) 
Dr. George A. Hubbell, President Lincoln Memorial Univer- 
sity, Cumberland Gap, Tennessee, was next to speak upon the 
subject. His paper follows: 
EDUCATION WITHIN THE MOUNTAIN WALLS. 
G. A. HUBBELL, PH. D. 
“I, THE LAND.” 
Appalachian American is an unknown land; a land of ro- 
mance, charm and mystery. It includes the mountain territory 
of some eight States, reaching southward from Pennsylvania 
‘until it loses itself in the plains of Alabama. The mountains 
have rounded tops, and except where man has stripped them 
of the verdue, they are forest-clad. The valleys are, for the 
most part, winding and narrow; are sharp foldings which show 
nature in a mighty mood. The rivers are irregular and wind- 
ing, fed from mountain springs and rushing down like little 
torrents after every rain. The roadways are largely in the 
creek bottoms, and one rides up one creek over a pass in the 
mountains and down another, and directions are given, not by 
roadways, but by creeks. As I rode on one of the great ridges 
separating Virginia and Kentucky, and looked over this land, 
I realized as never before what a tremendous barrier nature 
has thrown across the path of man in his progress. The peo- 
ple are settled in mountain coves; the houses near the mouth
-P-A-G-E-214
  214 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
of the river are often of fair size; a little farther up of two or 
three rooms, and at the head of the cove only a vest-pocket 
dwelling, though it may hold a large family. 
“TI, THD PEOPLE.” 
The people in these mountain fastnesses are of the sterling 
Anglo-Saxon blood, with independence, ambition, love of lib- 
erty and the tenacity and perseverance which knows no defeat. 
Their blood is the inheritance from the men of Hastings, who 
fought against William the Conqueror, and blending with the 
Norman nobles, have wrought out character and power in a 
thousand years of toil and strivings and discipline. Paraphras- 
ing Page, though they are called “poor whites,” and are white 
enough and poor enough, but not unworthy nor of ignoble 
blood. In these pockets of the mighty hills they have worked 
out for themselves such destinies as well they may, and bound 
by the ties of kinship or necessify to abide in the home nest. 
Many in a restless and never-ceasing westward tide have over- 
flowed into the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Ar- 
kansas, Oklahoma and the far west amid a new environment, 
to found for themselves great homes and achieve greater des- 
tinies than could be possible with them at home, but I would 
speak of the mountaineer at home of splendid stock, with the 
Revolutionary aspect, with a loyal love of home. He has been 
beating against his mountain wall for more than a hundred 
years, and the education from the outside world must be edu- 
cation, suited to his needs and his environments. 
It is the fundamental fact of education that man reacts upon 
his surroundings. The dweller of the mountains is not dif- 
ferent from other of our stock, except as isolation has made 
him so, this isolation has resulted in a narrow experience, in 
narrow but deeper experience. The virtues and vices have 
been intensified. The splendid loyalty to kin, and the recogni- 
tion of the ties of blood, both find here unusual emphasis, so 
the fued may be understood and explained, and so the moon: 
shine habit which still marks many of the remote mountain 
regions, has grown up strongly among a people, earnest, inde- 
pendent, individualistic, proud, purposeful and determined.

“11, ‘THE CONDITIONS.” 
The education for the boys and girls of this region has the 
same need as education of all the land—that is, that it should 
be practical, sensible, and fit near to the needs of daily life. 
Against this type of education there are two great forces con- 
tending from the outside. The first is a well-meant effort to 
standardize education everywhere in the country, and par- 
ticularly higher education. It is a movement to fit all regions, 
all men, all conditions, with the same carefully worked out 
positive and definite standards, but with the great variety in 
initiative, in ability, in purpose, in plans and in thought among 
the people and the great differences in conditions and stand- 
ards of life, it is doomed to fail. The other cause is the cry 
of the philanthropic demagogue that the mountain child must 
have no education beyond the common school. Now just as in 
the years that are gone an eternal stream has been pouring to 
the westward, and boys of unusual promise and aim pull and 
burst from their restricted environment, and find for them- 
selves the room and opportunities for the larger educational 
lives. There is no way to keep the American boy on the farm, 
or to shut him up in the mountains, except to surround him 
with an army of soldiers, and then he can be kept there dead, 
but not living. They will exercise the same right to change 
their location and to take up other activities as do the people 
of other regions, and this is as it ought to be. 
“Ivy. THE AIM.” 
The aim of education for the mountains must be the frank 
and practical aim of earning a living and making a life. 
There is no use to pretend longer. We will come to the best 
results by the simple acceptance of the fact that school ought 
always to prepare for the duties of earning a Jiving, of mak- 
ing a home, of performing one’s duty as a citizen, and living 
one’s life in the world, and this preparation should not be 
made in any remote or abstract sense, but consciously and 
directly for the end to be attained. The larger share of our 
food is imported from beyond our boundaries; in a region 
where the petty and commonplace receive too much considera- 
tion; in a region where the human factor performs only a
-P-A-G-E-216
216 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
small share of its normal office, it is important that the edu- 
cation should adapt itself promptly and directly to the real 
need. In a region where tuberculosis has in its deadly grip 
a considerable share of the population; in a region which 
suffers from the annual ravages of typhoid fever and small- 
pox. It is futile to discuss any system of education which 
leaves out adequate and wise training in the laws of health. 
  “y, THE MATTER AND THE METHOD.” 
With this as a fundamental, goes the child’s independent 
thought of how to care for his body, how to protect himself 
from the ravages of disease, how to feed and clothe himself 
against the warring elements and deadly germs. There is 
much stress placed on economy among those who discuss 
mountain education, but the need is not so much economy 
among the people as it is abundance. There must be a great 
increase in the food supply. Agriculture, gardening and dairy- 
ing should be taught in a practical and comprehensive manner. 
Every fertile spot in the mountains must be yielding its share 
for the support of human life. It is a notorious fact that there 
is poured into the mountain markets of the South, the second- 
hand goods and clothing, inferior and spoiled articles of food 
from many a manufacturer or wholesale dealer’s shelf-worn 
supply. No one has a right to complain of this, if our people 
are willing to buy such goods, for it is a part of the great 
economical law which operates over the whole country; but 
we must be alert to manufacture for ourselves such food, cloth- 
ing and products of daily life as can profitably be made at 
home, and we must manufacture for the outside world, baskets, 
furniture, rugs and a number of distinctive articles, which 
will bring wealth to the region. Our first independence must 
be an economical independence, and our first triumph must 
be a triumph in the essentials of earning a living and desery- 
ing to have one. 
A few days ago a gentleman connected with a great enter- 
prise, conducted from Washington City, which operates all 
over the entire South, made the statement that for office men, 
stenographers, promoters and managers, he was continually 
driven to import help, because the great mass of those pre- 
pared in our territory were not able to carry on the work 
 
-P-A-G-E-217
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 217 
successfully. Only in the great cities of the South has office 
training reached a degree of excellence which affords a satis- 
factory output. 
The eternal struggle goes on, and our people must be 
equipped to do their work promptly and efficiently, and our 
education must have sufficient range and thoroughness to meet 
the need. No education is worth thinking about, unless it 
prepares our boys and girls to do their part and hold their 
place in the great industrial and commercial development upov 
which the New South has entered. 
It is true enough that the majority of these boys and girls 
will make their homes in the mountains, but with the develop- 
ment of our mines and the utilizing of our forests in our own 
region, this will become a great field of commercial and indus- 
trial activity, and our people must bear their part or fail. 
It is perfectly natural that the range of our boys and girls 
should be narrow. They have seen little of the world. Many 
of them have never looked upon a railroad train. Others have 
seen a building of but two or three stories in height, and still 
others have no conception of the stir, activity and intensity 
of modern business. Their ideals are permeated by a spirit 
of “supreme leisure,’ which is fatal to the best achievement, 
but the education is not wholly, nor perhaps chiefly, from the 
school. By means of the rural mail delivery, the great world 
Hfe presses into every mountain cove and hamlet. New ideas 
and impulses are at work among the people, and the throb 
of the national purpose and the national life is felt by the 
quiet mountain brook and in the lonesome mountain store. 
It is wonderful that near and far the life of our whole 
people operates among us with new lessons of power and shap- 
ing, with the aim frankly recognized as practical. With the 
material understood and used, one turns to the method of 
instruction. This method must be largely determined by the 
need of the one to be instructed, and that need points to the 
use of our visualizing agencies. Pictures and models must be 
used in abundance. The laboratory and the work shop must 
have a place in every system of sound education, and the 
training of these boys and girls must include some plan for 
their immediate and helpful touch with the outside world, 
where agricultural trains, extension courses, illustrated lec-  
-P-A-G-E-218
218 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
tures and all of the agencies for community education swing 
at once into place. 
The practical and enterprising policy of the State Depart- 
ment of Health, particularly in Louisiana, Tennessee and in 
some of our other Southern States, illustrates my meaning. 
The students of these mountains are born of that stock which 
loves the National Government and believes in its cause, and 
in its plans. No better soil can be found for the planting of 
patriotism than that of our own Southern mountains, where 
the people are ready with the slightest stimulus to enter upon 
new duties and use new opportunities for the development 
of our national life. They know the meaning of the flag, and 
respond to its call with enthusiasm. | 
In our own school the flag pole long in use had fallen, dis- 
abled. The students at once determined that it should be 
worthily replaced. They went to Colonel Patterson, an ex- 
Confederate soldier living two miles away, and stated the 
need. He told them to find the best pine tree on the place. 
This was cut, drawn by the college team to the grounds, and, 
after being trimmed, was painted, and presently by the 
enthusiasm and hard work of the boys, it was put in place, 
so that the flag again flies on every fair day over our school 
grounds. It is not a solitary incident, but with suitable initia- 
tive will repeat itself in almost any quarter of our great moun- 
tain region among the millions of our people. 
“VI, THE SPIRIT OF THE WORK.”   Any reformer who plants himself upon material ideals and 
agencies alone is already doomed to defeat. The mighty part 
of a man’s nature is the deathless part, and with all the con- 
servations which the world has—with our conservation of tim- 
ber and coal, and water-power and the soil, there is nothing 
equal to the sublime and beautiful conservation of childhood— 
care for the developing, the concentrating and the utilizing of 
the finest elements in the human soul for the achievement of 
great and noble and beautiful results. I say then that our 
supreme factor in attaining this particular and definite edu- 
cation is to be found in the planting and cultivating of right 
and high ideals, in the kindling of life and character, in 
quickening minds that have been sluggish or asleep, and in 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 219 
  putting our young people in possession of themselves. Such 
preparation and such work are the things we seek for the 
attainment of the true education in our mountains. With 
the growth of the spirit of brotherhood; with the new sense 
of codéperation in work and play; with the new understanding 
of man’s place in the world, and the unparalleled value of 
the human soul, we shall find a new spirit in education pene- 
trating, permeating, kindling, and achieving for all men things 
noble and things excellent beyond what they had thought or 
dreamed. It is first, then, for our purpose, the development 
of the individual soul, that he may be excellent, that he may 
be strong, that he may be true, that he may be efticient in 
the every-day needs of life.’ And then it is the higher achieve- 
ment that one shall have abundant spiritual vitality; that he 
shall respond to large needs; that he shall note the feeling of 
brotherhood and the sense of power which should come to him. 
These lives, these thoughts, and these opportunities are the 
ones that await the education in the mountains. With the 
new consciousness of the nearer relations there will spring a 
new State and national consciousness, which will make patriot- 
ism not an iridescent dream, but a great, living and glowing 
reality, and having mastered first the things that are imme- 
diate and practical we shall go with winged speed to the attain- 
ment of the things that are noble and spiritual and eternal. 
(Applause. ) 
Tue Cuair: It is with great pride and pleasure that I 
present the next speaker, who is a Kentucky product, a “live 
wire” of the Kentucky mountains. I have often thought that 
if she in her environment can do great things, how much more 
should we, who live in so much better environment, accom- 
plish. Her environment is to that of yours what Helen Kellar’s 
is to the normal child. The lady whom I shall introduce to 
you is the only County Superintendent in the United States 
who has established night schools in every school of her county. 
In these schools men and women students from 21 to 94 years 
of age have learned to read and write. Last year more than 
1,200 of these older students attended the night schools. 
I now take great pleasure in introducing to you Mrs. Cora 
Wilson Stewart, Superintendent of Rowan County, Kentucky,

who also has the honor of being President of the tucky 
Educational Association. (Applause.) 
Mrs. Stewart held the closest attention of the large audience 
during the presentation of the following paper, the reading of 
which was frequently interrupted by applause. | 
THE EDUCATION OF THE MOUNTAIN CHILD. 
MRS. C. W. STEWART, MOREHEAD, KY. 
  The mountain child, so long isolated and retarded, so long 
enslaved by poverty and ignorance, so long imprisoned between 
high hills and bridgeless streams, has missed much in the 
march of civilization ; but has preserved the purity of his Anglo- 
Saxon blood, and has gathered strength, freshness and recep- 
tiveness which fit him today for a development more rapid 
than the world has ever witnessed. He stands out before the 
world today a creature wonderfully interesting in his possi- 
bilities for development, and wonderfully pathetic and appeal- 
ing in his lack of opportunities. 
His intellect has never been weakened by wines or dissipating 
narcotics; his perceptions have never been dulled by the glitter 
and glare and rush cf a money-mad world, and his blood has 
never been infused with the sluggish, impure blood of alien 
races. When opportunities are added commensurate with 
these natural advantages, a new and distinct and powerful 
type of citizen will enter the arena of America’s activities 
and America’s achievements, to measure his abilities against 
those who have inherited generations of culture, and to add 
his quota of greatness and usefulness to the nation’s citizen- 
ship. 
An analysis of the capaci of an individual may guide us 
in determining his worthiness, his needs and his possibilities. 
Heredity, that powerful agent which, though it may not fix 
a destiny against all environment, may invest a character with 
such qualities of true greatness as will forbid contentment 
with an inferior sphere, has lavished on the mountain child 
qualities of honesty, pride, originality, ambition, loyalty and 
reverence. 
Honesty is one of the post pronounced characteristics of the 
mountain child. His contempt for dishonesty, in any form, is
-P-A-G-E-221
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 221 
always strongly manifested. The boy who cheats in a moun- 
tain school is promptly banished from the playground, an out- 
cast from the associations and good offices of his fellows; while 
the one who fights and conquers is eulogized and worshipped 
as a hero. And when the mountain boy becomes a mountain 
man, it is because of this same overwhelming contempt for 
dishonesty that he has earned the reputation as juror for 
sending to the penitentiary the man who has stolen a hog, while 
he oftentimes exonerates the one who has taken human life. 
Locks and keys are superfluous attachments on the doors of 
mountain homes. Public sentiment is sufficiently strong to 
bar all attempt at theft, and robbery is, in that country, a 
thing unknown. The mountain child, backed by generations 
of honest men and women and having the abomination for 
dishonesty so strongly inbred, absolutely will not compromise 
with it in any of its forms, whether it be petit thieving or 
legalized graft. For this trait alone, his development wou!d 
be much to a world which so much needs men, honest men. 
“Men whom the lust of office does not kill; 
Men whom the greed of office cannot buy; 
Men who possess opinions and a will; 
Men who can stand before a demagogue 
And scorn his flatteries without winking; 
Tall men, sun crowned, who live above the fog 
In public duty and in private thinking.” 
The pride of the mountain child has militated somewhat 
against his higher development, as well as against his present 
welfare and comfort. Alms he will not accept, even when 
confronted with dire straits of poverty and suffering. Well 
did the author of “The Trail of the Lonesome Pine” conceive 
this trait in the character of little June Tolliver, and well did 
he conceal John Hale’s charity to her under the guise of a 
payment of a debt for her father’s coal lands; for had he pre- 
sented her as accepting charity knowingly and willingly, his 
characterization would have been both unjust and untrue. An 
example of this pride was witnessed recently by ai teacher in 
a mountain district school in one of the poorer sections. The 
teacher, wishing to inculcate a lesson in charity, and to instill 
into her pupils the true Christmas spirit, announced that the 
school would close with a Christmas tree, from which gifts
-P-A-G-E-222
  222, SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
would be distributed to the poor children, and to the poor 
alone. The announcement was received without comment - or 
demonstration, but when the hour arrived for a distribution 
of the gifts, all little hands were folded and every child sat 
with eyes blazing with indignation, and lips set with deter- 
mination; and sweets and fruits and glittering toys, so tempt- 
ing an appeal to childish hearts the wide world over, were 
promptly and positively refused, for not one would confess 
himself in a class more dependent than his neighbor. The 
mendicants of the nation, if mendicants it must have, will 
have to come from the low lands; the pride of the mountain 
child will save him forever from that class. 
The originality of the mountain child has provided more 
than one author with a cherished theme, and has led a reading 
public into a new and delightful field of literature; and yet 
it is a subject which has scarcely been touched, and affords 
today a rare and prolific field for some gifted writer of child 
stories. Untrammeled by the world’s customs, and haviug 
but a limited knowledge of its books, he is one of the freest 
and most independent of thinkers. His originality stamps 
every crude composition, every invention, every utterance, and 
every effort as something different from the hackneyed phrases 
and efforts employed by the masses of children of this age. 
1t is a delight to read of the sayings and doings of an original 
child; but it is better to develop and utilize him, and to apply 
his originality to the science, art, literature and invention of 
the world. a 
Ambition and loyalty, two well-known traits of the moun: 
tain child, have already been too widely advertised by his 
fathers. Not to blood-thirstiness must be attributed the feuds 
which bave arrayed clan against clan, but to a loyalty which 
knows no satisfaction in giving or requiring less than life 
itself, and to an ambition which prefers notoriety to obscurity, 
condemnation to oblivion, and which accepts the world’s scorn 
rather than escape the world’s notice. The call of the feud 
is but the call of this ambition—an ambition to achieve, to 
excel, to display his prowess, to overcome; or the call of-a 
loyalty which has threaded itself down to him through the 
generations from his early ancestors, the Scottish clansman. 
Such an ambition, properly directed, might mean’ an achieve-  
-P-A-G-E-223
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 223 
ment of no inferior order; and such Joyalty, under cultivation, 
may become support of church, organization, State or nation 
so unswerving that neither need fear his desertion, treason, 
or failure of duty. 
Whatever may be said of the ignorance of the mountain 
child, he is wiser than many learned men in his knowledge 
of God. Religious fervor and reverence for his Creator are 
instincts as lasting within him as his immortal soul. Men of 
affairs and large responsibilities may feel that they can assume 
and direct such without invoking divine aid and guidance; 
but The Little Shepkerd of Kingdom Come knows that when 
he is “only a boy” and must rise to the occasion “and ack 
like a man,” that it requires the sustaining power of the Omni- 
potent. The mountain child is devout in the days of his youth, 
and among his fathers you will find no atheists. 
The tastes, talents and inclinations of the individual should 
guide us somewhat, too, in his training for higher useful- 
ness. The mountain child is by nature poetical. What the 
child of the plains accepts as a matter-of-fact occurrence, the 
child of the hills invests with mystery and charm and weaves 
into crude yet rythmical verse or ballad. His teacher can 
witness that the mountain child is a poet; that he turns with 
indifference from prose to read poetry with delight; that the 
preparation of prose composition is regarded by him as a 
hardship, while the same subject will be presented in verse 
with ease and often excellence. “Rebecca of Sunnybrook 
Farm” has many a counterpart among the hills. Not only 
romance and tragedy, but even trivial neighborhood occur- 
rences and peculiarities are sufficient to inspire descriptive 
pallad or verse. The ballad is, in fact, his weapon of ridicule— 
and again, his instrument of eulogy. These compositions may 
deal with subjects as sublime as love or war, or as ridiculous 
as the teacher’s faults and frailities. Even letters in rhyme 
and poetic subscriptions are not rare among ‘the first’ com- 
munications of mountain boys and girls. 
Oratory is one of his richest gifts, there being many a Cicero 
and Demosthenes among the hills whom even illiteracy cannot 
chain to silence. If he finds no other avenue for the practice 
and display of this talent, frequently he seeks the pulpit of 
a’ certain sect which welcomes unlearned men as ministers,
-P-A-G-E-224
224 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
    and permits six or eight speakers to address an audience at 
one sitting, and there he displays this natural oratory which 
fills and inspires him. Not a dearth of speakers, but an over- 
abundance of them may be found in certain mountain counties. 
In some counties there are very few men who will not attempt 
to express their views or to preach or deliver an oration before 
an audience; and a child omitted from the school exhibition 
program is a child deprived, insulted and outraged. 
There are sufficient distinct characteristics and talents of 
the mountain child to occupy a discussion of greater length 
than the time allotted to this; but there are other conditions 
of equal importance to the child and to those who may be 
interested in his development. 
If there be one who can surpass the mountain child in 
wealth of character and in brilliance and originality of mind, 
there is none who can equal him in the insatiate desire of 
knowledge. As one long starved eats ravenously, the moun- 
tain child, long deprived of opportunity, embraces it with 
unusual and astounding avidity. More than a childlike curios- 
ity must be satisfied by all with whom he comes in contact. 
Every visitor is converted into ‘an instructor, and subjected 
to an examination or quiz. This remarkable curiosity is not 
the only symptom of an eager, hungry mind; for such brave 
and heroic efforts haye been made by mountain girls and boys 
in their struggle for an education as would entitle them to 
an honored page in education’s history. These incidents have 
never graced the pages of the newspapers, however, which have 
devoted so much space to his fathers’ vendettas. 
For instance, journalism, one of the most crowded and exact- 
ing professions, did not appear too difficult for one little moun- 
tain couple, brother and sister, age 10 and 12; so they started 
a little newspaper, styled “The Young Mountaineer.” Having 
no equipment but a few galleys of discarded type, they used a 
picture frame for a chase, and wedged in the type with sticks, 
and published for several years this crude little sheet to defray 
their expenses in school. 
One mountain girl, living on a cliff twelve miles from any 
settlement, having not available means, and desiring a college 
education, set herself up in competition with the great hosiery 
factories of the world and knitted socks at twelve and a half 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 225 
  cents a day, and laid her hard-earned fund at the shrine of 
education. 
Another girl, being denied employment in a college town 
in any position requiring the services of a girl, sacrificed her 
womanliness and her pride, over-reached her strength and 
endangered her health by masquerading in masculine attire 
and assuming the sterner, severer duties of a boy. She had 
worked her way almost through school when her identity was 
discovered, and she was forced to retreat; and there was not 
a student in her class which stood above or equal to her. 
One other incident, a mountain boy in North Carolina, learn- 
ing that there was a scholarship to be secured in a school in 
the Kentucky hills, set out a-foot at once to claim the coveted 
prize. He did not halt or hesitate, was not deterred by dis- 
tance or danger, but braved alone every peril of the mountain 
fastness, and endured every hardship of its rough and rugged 
road, and walked into the school with bare and bleeding feet, 
but a happy heart, to claim tbe cherished opportunity. 
Such incidents as these, and others equally as significant, 
exonerates the mountaineer forever of the charge that he is 
indifferent concerning education, or that he is content and 
satisfied with his present condition. These incidents all 
occurred within a small area; to enlarge the area and to 
extend the acquaintance with the mountain child, will but 
produce more overwhelmingly convincing evidence. ‘The cause 
of education has not, indeed, so faithful an advocate and fol- 
iower as the mountain child; the goddess, Minerva, has no sub- 
ject so loyal and adoring: worshipping at her shrine. His 
allegiance to her should surely be rewarded by her prompt 
and hearty recognition of him. There are races and classes 
which have to have education forced upon them. To force 
education upon the indifferent and the self-satisfied, while the 
most eager, hungry-minded children of the nation cry for learn- 
ing, is like taking bread from the starving and forcing it upon 
the satiated. This organization, which is pledged to the 
advancement of the cause of education in the South, does well 
today to consider the thousands of children within its Appala 
chian region. You do well to remember who these children 
are—not the descendants of the African, the Mongolian, or 
ether inferior races, but the sons of the Clays, the Jacksons, 
15

  the Lees, the Marshalls, and all the nobility of the South; 
boys and girls, who, like little Chad, have kinsmen in the val- 
leys more distinguished, but none more proud and honorable. 
Who and what the mountain child is—his abilities and 
ambitions are easier to outline than a proper and adequate 
course of instruction suitable to his needs and environment. 
His educational advantages, if equal in provision to those of 
other children, must necessarily be limited by the topography 
and climatic conditions of his country; for when the short 
term public school is efficient, the child is deprived of much 
of the session; for even the rain, which blesses flock and field, 
renders mountain roads impassable and swells the bridgeless 
streams between the mountain child and the school. 
Faithful and efficient service on the part of the road builder 
seems as necessary a condition in the education of the moun- 
tain child, as faithful and efficient service on the part of the 
school teacher. The educational advantages of the masses of 
mountain children lie entirely in the short-term public schools. 
Denominational institutions, scattered here and there, have 
afforded for the last quarter of a century superior advantages 
to some, and in several Southern States high schools have been 
established, which add to the advantages of those who live 
adjacent to the town, or can overcome poverty and ignorance 
sufficiently to reach and attend them. Even the institutions 
which he has, in fact, are not always accessible, and will never 
be until he has overcome to some extent the handicaps of 
poverty and rugged roads. 
Good roads, longer and more efticient elementary schoots, 
with a more practical course of siudy, efficient secondary 
schools with industrial departments, separate and _ well- 
equipped industrial institutions, all have their part to play 
in his education. Being more poetical than practical, he needs 
the balance of industrial training. He needs to have his ideals 
readjusted—the best and truest retained, the lowest and most 
pernicious elevated or destroyed. He needs industrial training, 
not merely as a balance and a force of readjustment, but as 
an avenue of escape, emancipation from pauperism to pros- 
perity, from ignorance to intellectuality. 
His course of study needs to be altered to meet his condition 
and environment. Instead of the mathematics of the stock 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
  JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGS. 227 
exchange, the shipyard and the clearing-house, he needs the 
mathematics of the field, the forest and the mine; it will do 
him no harm to ascertain the boundaries of Liberia or Man- 
churia, to read Cicero or Caesar, provided he also learns the 
elements of the soil beneath his feet, “which lifts bread to 
him and roses sweet.” He had better know how to discover 
the secret wealth of the hills than to know the greatest depth 
of the Atlantic Ocean; should know how to live in content- 
ment, comfort, peace and prosperity among the hills, as well 
as to recount the world’s famous battles and to enumerate 
its most successful generals. He should be taught, not only 
how to construct a correct English sentence, but how to con- 
yert each tree into its highest use, whether for shelter, fruit 
or shade; and how to use each furrow of the soil in his valleys 
and on his hillsides to their adapted purpose. He may scan 
poetry with profit, but with greater profit could learn to scan 
the secret wealth of the hills, to drag forth and enrich himself 
with their hidden treasures. Practical education and indus- 
trial training will not woo him from his higher ambitions nor 
prevent him trom reaching higher attainments; they will only 
assist him to greater achievements. 
The-crying needs of the hour in the Southern mountains are 
industrial training for the young mountain child, and some 
provision for at least the rudiments of an education for the 
adult, those mentioned by one speaker previously as being 
“children in the acquirement of knowledge,” and I will add, 
not merely in the lack of knowledge, but in their childish eager- 
ness for it, as well. While I would not add to the burdens 
of the already over-burdened South, I must declare it my con- 
viction that we are responsible for the development of more 
than its Appalachian youth; we are responsible, too, for the 
education of his father and his mother. There is in the moun-, 
tainous section of the South as great demand for intellectual 
development among those who have passed youth’s golden age 
without having shared youth’s opportunities and glory, as 
ever burned in the breasts of any unfortunate retarded people. 
Even if these people were resigned to their fate, would it be 
good political economy to overlook and neglect them, and shall 
the South wait for its highest achievement and recognition, its 
greater glory and completer culture, until this people of re-

    markable vigor and longevity live out their quarter or half 
century in ignorance and die? But, I wish to emphasize the 
fact that they are not resigned; that the hearts of these adult 
mountain children throb with a yearning for intellectual free- 
dom as great as filled the hearts of our forefathers for civic 
and religious freedom. Whatever may have been the exper- 
iences of others who are engaged in mountain work, whether 
they have been confronted with the startling evidences of this 
demand, I do not know; but to me it has appealed with over- 
whelming force. 
In response to this great need, we have answered to some 
degree in Kentucky. with an experiment, already mentioned by 
the President of this Association, as “the rural night school,” 
or moonlight school.” Before I relate the history of that experi- 
ment, may I take you into my confidence and relate the specific 
incidents, personal experiences which enlightened me as to the 
necessity of providing some educational facilities for adult 
mountaineers ? 
Mollie McGlothin, a mountain woman, bent with age, came 
into my office one morning, fondling a letter tenderly. Her 
daughter had grown up and: secured an education, had gone 
to Chicago and engaged in business. Her letters were the 
one bright spot in the old woman’s existence, and the drafts 
which they contained were often the only means of relieving 
her present necessities. When a letter came, she usually went 
to the home of some neighbor and engaged their services to 
interpret its precious contents. Occasionally she came to town, 
some seven miles, to enlist my services, and I anticipated that 
such was her mission on this occasion. “A letter from Jane!’ 
I exclaimed. “Shall I read it for you, Mollie?” Her face 
fairly beamed. “No,” she replied, “I have learned to read and 
write, and am going to answer it myself.” “Learned to read 
“and write!” I exclaimed in astonishment. Why, only a month 
ago she was ignorant of the significance of the slightest literary 
character. I questioned her and drew from her this simple 
story. “Well, sometimes the neighbors were busy and some- 
times the cricks were up, and I got tired, anyway, runnin’ 
round botherin’ the neighbors, and, then, I jist wanted to read 
with my own eyes what Jane had writ with her own hand, 
so I went to the store and got me a speller, and I sot up till 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 229 
midnight at night, and sometimes till daylight until I larned 
to spell and read and write.” And to verify the statement, she 
spelled out slowly the words of her daughter’s treasured mis- 
sive; and then, under my direction, she sat down and wrote 
her first letter, an achievement which delighted her beyond 
all expression, and which must have delighted Jane more. 
A few months later a prepossessing mountain man of middle 
age came into my office, and while waiting for me to dispatch 
some other business fingered several books wistfuily, turning 
them over and over again, and laying them down at last 
with a sigh. Knowing the scarcity of interesting books 
throughout the country, I inquired whether he wished to take 
one home with him to read, and he replied with tears in his 
eyes, “No, I cannot read or write. I would give twenty years 
of my life if I could.” 
Again, a short time afterward, at a school entertainment in 
the country, a tall six-foot, sturdy, handsome mountain lad 
of twenty-one, stepped out and without embarassment and 
with great force and power sang a long and interesting ballad, 
partly original and partly borrowed from his English ances- 
tors. When he sat down I went over and took a seat beside 
him, and said, “Dennis, I should be pleased if you would write 
me a copy of that ballad. It is worthy of publication.” He 
replied, “I would if I could write. I have thought up a hundred 
of them, some better and longer than that, but I forgot them 
before I could get somebody to write them down.” 
Each of these incidents were impressive; together they were 
overwhelming. Opportunities must be provided for them, 
but how? The day schools were already crowded, and the 
mountain people must employ every hour of the day anyway 
in toil to eke out an existence. Then came the inspiration, 
“the rural night school,” or “moonlight school,” as we have 
designated them, because they were conducted on moonlight 
nights when travel along steep and rugged roads was not 
so hazardous as on the dark nights. I gathered the teachers 
around me, outlined the plan, called for volunteer service, 
and without any difficulty enlisted them heart and soul in the 
cause. On Labor Day, September 4th, the teachers observed as 
a real Labor Day, by walking over their districts, explaining 
the plan and announcing the opening, which was to occur 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
230 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  the following evening. The demand was great; the teachers 
knew it and I knew it, and we confidently expected that there 
would be an average of two or three pupils to each teacher, 
making perhaps 150 adult pupils in the county; but we never 
knew how great it was until the doors opened and the school 
bells rang out for the first moonlight schools in America, when 
twelve hundred boys and girls, ranging in age from eighteen 
to eighty-six, came trooping up out of the hollows and over 
the hills, some to receive their first lesson in reading and writ- 
ing, and some to improve their limited education. Illiterate 
merchants who had been in business for years, ministers who 
had been attempting to lead their flocks along paths of 
righteousness, lumbermen who had engaged in commerce with- 
out having in their possession the keys of learning which would 
most successfully unlock its doors, took advantage of the oppor- 
tunity, and actually learned to read and write. Mothers came 
that they might learn to write letters to their precious sons 
and daughters in distant lands; fathers came that they might 
learn to read and write sufficiently to exercise the divine right 
of suffrage with secrecy and security. They came with dif- 
ferent aims and purposes, but, after all, inspired by the one 
great aim—the escape from the bondage of ignorance and the 
stigma of illiteracy. Almost one-third of the popuiation of 
one little county was enrolled, and it was a county which con- 
tained no greater porportion of illiterates than many others 
in the South, both lowland and highland. They had all the 
excuses and all the barriers which any people might offer—high 
hills, bridgeless streams, rugged roads, weariness from the 
day’s hard toil, the shame of beginning study late in life, and 
all the others; but they were not seeking excuses—they were 
sincerely and earnestly seeking knowledge, and I have in my 
hands some proofs that they found it. Their interest, their 
zeal and their enthusiasm were wonderful to witness. It was 
truly an inspiring sight to see these aged pupils bending over 
the desks which their children and grandchildren had occupied 
during the day. I have witnessed many degrees of joy and 
pride, but their delight in learning and their pride in their 
achievements exceeded any joy that I have ever witnessed. 
It was an inspiring sight to see the patient, noble, unselfish, 
young teachers instructing by night as well as by day; and it

is an inspiring thought to remember who these teaciiers were— 
their neighbor girls and boys who had secured an education, 
and had gone back to elevate their own communities; teachers 
who knew best the peculiarities and limitations of their senior 
pupils, and could best encourage and inspire and Jead them . 
along the road of learning. They used as a text a little news- ~

paper, especially prepared for the occasion, containing simple 
sentences concerning the movements of pupils with whom they 
were acquainted, together with such sentences as would in- 
spire their county pride and awaken them to continued effort. 
The object in using this paper was as much to save them from 
the embarassment of using a primer, and to arouse in them

the felling of importance in being, from their first lesson, a 
reader of a newspaper, as for the objects already erumerated. 
The first lesson of the rural night schools was a decided 
success; one hundred persons learned to read and write, and 
- Jetters from persons who had ever been denied the delightful 
' privilege of correspondence found their way in large numbers 
into the mails. Some of these letters came to my desk, as 
I had offered a book to each one who would learn to write 
a letter during the first two weeks’ term. They may not be 
so interesting to you as they were to the recipient; but I can 
assure you that her firsi love letter was not so highly prized. 
The first one I received is as follows:

I hold in my hand some interesting pictures of these adult 
pupils, the picture of a woman 86 years of age, the oldest 
student in America;,a night school class of persons who had 
passed over the crest of the hill of life, each one being over 
fifty years of age; a group of four families who were in one 
school at one time, the children during the day and the fathers 
and mothers at night; the picture of a Baptist minister, past 
fifty years of age, who had for thirty years been leading his 
followers blindly and ignorantly, but after the first session 
of “moonlight schools” could preach from the text found in 
Job, “Who is this that darkeneth council by words without 
knowledge?” 
The reports from the various schools bore witness as to 
the great interest of the people and the demand for an exten- 
sion of the term. The question, “Was the night school popu- 
lar?” “Was there a demand for an extension of the term?” 
brought, in every instance, an affirmative reply. The question, 
“What was the effect on the day school?” was answered in 
each instance by the reply, “It increased-the interest and the 
attendance.” Parents who had never seemed to be in sympathy 
with the school made sacrifices after their attendance at the 
night school to send every child. To the teachers’ reports were 
appended many letters, telling in an enthusiastic way of the 
fine spirit manifested and the great good accomplished, and 
the result was of course an extension of the term. I could 
spend hours telling you of pathetic and inspiring incidents, of 
incidents of joy over the emancipation from ignorance; but 
there is not time to dwell on the subject longer. Suffice it to 
say that the rural night school fills a much-needed want in the 
lives, not only of the adult mountain child, but of any other 
adult country child in the South. It has been tried and 
adopted in one county in Kentucky, and is already being 
adopted in others. By this means we propose to wipe out 
illiteracy from the mountainous section of Kentucky and pre- 
sent that people to the commonwealth, a people happy, con- 
tented, intelligent and useful, uot merely in its younger genera- 
tion, but in its entirety. 
For the older mountain child we can foresee, when educated, 
years of satisfaction, even usefulness and perhaps prominence; 
for the younger, there seems no pinnacle of success beyond

THE TEACHER AS A FACTOR IN COMMUNITY LIFE. 
DR. J. J. DOYNE, CONWAY, ARK. 
  The wonderful advance of our country in point of popula- 
tion, development of resources, increase of trade relations and 
extension of comity between it and other nations, challenges 
the attention of all interested in our welfare, and no one in 
our day has cause for being pessimistic as regards the future 
of our land; yet no one denies that ours is, in many respects, 
a selfish age. The growth of corporate interests; the frequent 
holocausts that occur in buildings constructed without ade- 
quate protection for their inmates; the utter disregard of 
human life in pushing forward to successful completion great 
engineering projects; the constant strife between iabor and 
capital; the employing of deadly agencies in wreaking ven- 
geance on those who offer opposition to individuals cr organi- 
zations refusing to accede to demands at variance with their 
interests; corruption so widespread in political life; the un- 
precedented growth of the divorce evil, thus putting to shame 
the sanctity of the marriage vows and giving the leash to 
libertinism ; the travesties that so often mark the proceedings 
of our courts when wealth and power are arrayed against 
right and poverty—the prevalence of these among us has 
caused many to take a somber view of present conditions. But 
those who are the closest students of conditions tell us that 
these evils have had their day, and that there is abroad in 
the land a modern Theseus, whose mission it is to destroy these 
Minotaurs who have so long wrought havoc among us. 
’ There is, too, a growing tendency toward the development 
of the nation through the individual; thoughts of men are 
turning more and more toward giving the other half of the 
world a chance; the right to the amenities of life is being 
recognized; and, as a consequence, the thraldom that has so 
long marked the class whose life has been one long struggle 
for existence is giving way, and the value of a man, whatever 
his station, is no longer estimated by his social status or the 
size of his bank account.

Nations rise to their highest development when unity of 
purpose accentuates each and binds all into a harmonious 
whole. However diverse may be the phases of Jife and its 
varying activities, in the unselfish thought of each there comes 
the feeling that the hopes, the sacrifices, the fruition of one 
lend a potent influence toward the well-being of that great 
throbbing mechanism, human communal existence. 
It is well that the jurist should be versed in the law; the 
life or the property of his client may depend on this. It is 
meet that it should have large place in his thought, and that 
his daily endeavor should be to be more worthy of the faith 
' accorded him by his clientele. Should be suffrage of his peers 
or the fortune of appointive preferment place him in position 
to sit in judgment in legal matters, much more necessary is it 
that his time, his talent, his energy should be devoted to such 
prepartion as shall fit him to deal intelligently with matters 
under his jurisdiction. But let- him not overlook the fact 
that he is still a member of the great body politic, that he 
is a part of the seething multitude that are continually pressing 
toward the goal of successful venture. His knowledge of the 
jus gentiwm is of value, but as a citizen there are claims that 
he cannot ignore. His position as advisor is conceded; then 
are there not matters of public concern to which he must give 
due care and attention? Is it not his province to study closely 
the statutes of his State and Nation, with a view to popular- 
izing their merits and cultivating a public sentiment that 
shall put to work remedial agencies for their defects? Is his 
work done when he shall have performed well his duties as 
judge or as advocate? Or is there not a broader conception 
that he must entertain, a wider field in which his talent must 
be put to usury, a humanitarianism that must have large place 
in his thought? 
The physician is a necessaxy—I had almost said-—evil. His 
services are now and thén indispensable. The demands of 
his calling are most exacting, and no opportunity for thorough 
preparation for his work should be unimproved. The issues 
of life and death, verily, are at times in his hands; patient 
vigils by anxious bedsides; dire exposure by day and night; 
steady nerve in critical moments; stoical bearing in the midst 
of disconcerting laments—too well does he learn by experiences 
16

  about these and other matters incident to his profession. To 
husband his resources and his energies that he may be at his 
best in crucial moments is meet, to spend much time and labor 
in keeping alive to the advances being made by the masters 
in his line is proper; but can he overlook, without a failure 
to measure up to the stature of a full man, the duties that he 
owes to his commonwealth and nation? Who better than he 
becomes cognizant of the means that may be set in motion 
to prevent much of the sorrow, suffering and dissolution that 
some fatuous one would with stolid resignation call a dis- 
pensation of providence? The health and genera) welfare c‘ 
the people claim the henefit of his superior attainments. Not 
alone when the call comes for his visit to the sick should he 
consider the amelioration of conditions that may have brought 
on disease. Questions of sanitation, good water, pure air, 
comfortable housing, preper diet, and many others should have 
consideration, and those about him should have the benefit of 
his counsel. He calls himself a disciple of Aesculapius, but 
let him remember that as the god of medicine roamed the 
classic ways of Thessaly, accompanied by Telesphorus, the boy 
genius of healing, with him also went Hygeia, the goddess of 
health. 
To him who wears the vestments of the sanctuary, due rev- 
erence should be shown. That he be worthy of his sacred 
office no effort in the way of preparation should be spared. 
The representative of Him who came that the people might 
have more abundant life, his ideals and aims should be such 
as shall lure to higher heights, while he himself shall lead 
the way. His work, however, is only partly done when the 
functions of his office as minister to his congregation or pastor 
to his flock have been performed. In the busy marts of com- 
merce, along the crowded thoroughfares, in the haunts of vice 
and squalor, amid the scenes of pleasance—in all places, amid 
all conditions of life, wherever the soul’s need calls for a 
helper, there should his place be. Not only this; as a citizen 
of the world, his right to have voice in all councils consider- 
ing measures for the general welfare of the public should be 
conceded. His voice, if need be, should ring out strong and 
true to his convictions to what is best, and wisest, and most 
wholesome for the uplift of the people.

While mention has been made of these, the leading learned 
professions, who shall say that each in his sphere shall not have 
that broad, cosmopolitan view that incites him to do and to 
be his best for his home, his community, his State, his nation, 
the world? Yet into this work he must put his highest energy, 
his liveliest interest, his most intense enthusiasm, his un- 
swerving devotion, if even he is to get the best results out of 
it. As Ruskin says: “We are not sent into this world to 
do anything in which we cannot put our hearts. We have 
certain work to do for our bread, and this we are to do strenu- 
ously; other work to do for our delight, and that is to be done 
heartily; neither is it to be done by halves or shifts, but with 
a will; and what is not worth this effort, is not to be done 
at all.” 
Is it not passing strange that the one who has made pos- 
sible the accomplishments of the many in the varied walks 
of higher living should be inclined to discount his own worth, 
to narrow his path, to limit his horizon, to place metes and 
bounds to his own sphere of activity? Yet such, in large 
measure, has been the course pursued by the teacher, and he 
has been, in consequence, a thing apart from the world about 
him. His life has been to a great extent a drudgery; his 
dreams have been vague and uncertain; no visions of larger 
usefulness have ever entranced him; no plaudits from the mul- 
titude have ever entered into his conception; he has been con- 
tent to live out his little day and pass to silence and pathetic 
dust. 
It is a beautiful picture, though very unsatisfactory, that 
Thompson, in his “Day Dreams,” draws of the schoolmaster 
in Scotland: “From dawn to sunset of their daily toil they 
sowed the seed, or drave the plow, or brake with harrow the 
obstructive glebe. And when at length for them it was grow- 
ing dark, these husbandmen: dismissed their little reapers and 
gleaners and gat them home, wearied; and turn to; and fell 
on sleep. From modest homes they were borne unnoticed, to 
modest graves; but the statutes of the Cincinnatus-teachers 
stand not unwreathed with laurels in the Valhalla of great 
and good and single-hearted schoolmasters, with all the other 
good men and true.” 
That the sphere of activity of the teacher is primarily the

  schoolroom, no one will gainsay; that much time and study 
should be given by him to the problems so multiform that 
daily confront him, is readily admitted; that there are con- 
tinual drafts on his patience, his energy, his resourcefulness, 
few fully appreciate; that no overplus of time is left for out- 
side service when the demands of the schoolroom have been 
fully met, is still less understood; that the teacher’s worth 
as a man of affairs is often considered as practically nil is 
lamentably true; that the teacher should be chary of taking 
active part in community affairs where there is a division of 
sentiment, is sometimes urged. And why is all this the case? 
Is it that the community is not ready to welcome any who may 
aid in the upbuilding of its highest interests, or that they are 
jealous of their right to control their own affairs? Is it that 
the spirit of partisanship has overriden the spirit of justice, 
and that they are unwilling to grant to the teacher the in- 
alienable right to a candid expression of his views and the 
privilege of asserting himself as a man and a citizen? Is it 
that the traditions of the past as regards the idiosyncrasies 
of the schoolmaster have led them to conclude that he will be 
a misfit in all other positions? 
If in other vocations men have become leaders in public 
affairs, despite the engrossing duties of their chosen work; 
if they have been able so to distribute their time and energy 
that, without lessening their chances for success in their 
chosen field, they have been numbered among the statesmen, 
philanthropists and world-benefactors, surely the teacher— 
the one who has primarily done most to render all classes efti- 
cient for service—should feel it his duty to continue his work 
beyond the borders of the schoolroom, and should aspire to 
recognition among his fellowmen, not alone as the pedagogue, 
also as the socius communis et dux peritissimus. He is dis- 
counting his own influence when he concludes that those who 
were under his control and direction in childhood, or whose 
children were entrusted to his care in the morning hours of 
life, will fail to accord him consideration in matters with 
which he has just right to be identified. 
While it is not intended in this paper to discuss the rela- 
tion of the teacher to home life, it must not be forgot that 
his value as a visitor in the home, as a companion in public,
-P-A-G-E-245
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 245 
as an interested participant in social affairs is set at a high 
‘mark for good reason. In these varying relations, his ex- 
ample and influence have weight with young and old alike. It 
bodes no good for the pupil to be left to outside influences 
five-sixths of his time, unless the teacher can so shape his in- 
fluence that the lessons of the school may not be overshadowed 
by the extraneous circumstances that sometimes count for so 
much in the young life. Besides the child needs him on the 
outside to strengthen his purpose to put into effect the teach- 
ings that have appealed to his moral, esthetic, intellectual and 
devotional nature, and to keep his enthusiasm proof against 
the apathy, crassness, and laissez faire so apt to be found in 
many homes and communities. So frequently, too, is it the 
case that the interest shown by the teacher in the hours out 
of school creates a corresponding interest on the part of the 
parent in his offspring; possibly he determines that an alien 
shall not manifest more care for the welfare of his progeny 
than he, the progenitor, has been wont to exhibit. 
It is not insisted that the teacher should exploit his views 
on matters religious, but no one will deny that he who lives 
out the teaching of the greatest of all teachers, whose walk 
and conversation show forth his love of fellow-man and inter- 
est in his well-being, yet who is not ashamed to pin his faith 
to the friend “who sticketh closer than a brother,” and who 
strives each day to be more worthy of such friendship, will 
win to him adherents and coadjutors who might else have 
been indifferent to all his plans and paid no heed to his pleas. 
But here is the crux of the matter. The teacher so often 
withdraws himself from association with the busy, clamorous, 
surging world, and gradually loses his identity as one of the 
mass. Soon indifference sets in, and he thinks his duties have 
been performed when his classes have been dismissed and the 
scenes of his daily round have been abandoned for the while. 
The philosophy of Plato, the poety of Milton, the history of the 
Reformation, or even the vagaries of the New Thought in edu-. 
cation are more attractive to him than the happenings of the 
day in the great world about him, the timely discussion of 
vital issues in the current periodicals, or the tenets and plati- 
tudes of contending parties as set forth by their leaders in 
public debates or reviewed by their followers in chance dis-
-P-A-G-E-246
246 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  cussions. The advances in science, literature and art afford 
small interest to him, and more and more he lives in the past, 
withdraws himself from the fellowship and communion about 
him, and in semi-obscurity goes on his way, leading a life not 
much to be differentiated from that of the hermit. Yet there 
are those who would fain have him in their midst, who still 
cherish the lessons learned from him in former days, and are 
even now ready to listen to his counsel and be guided by his 
admonitions. 
Men are wont, however, to welcome to their midst those who 
are not simply able to tell what were best to be done, but who 
are also willing to take active part in the doing. Whatever 
we may say to the contrary, places of prominence are always 
open to those who in fact deserve them, though it may seem 
that “pull and pelf” are the open sesame to preferment. But 
the man who seeks on his own merits such favor must be will- 
ing to have his claims put to the test. Thus the teacher, 
naturally a leader, must under new conditions manifest his 
ability as such. In discussions of matters of public interest, 
he must demonstrate that his knowledge is not superficial ; 
in his estimate of men, his judgment must be clear and dis- 
cerning; in his alignment with those who represent the prin- 
ciples for which he stands, he must be able to defend his posi- 
tion, or at least impress others with the sincerity of his con- 
victions. 
Certainly the teacher should cultivate the best in society. 
There should be no shrinking on his part from associations 
with those who are recognized as leaders. Is not he seeking 
only the companionship of his peers, provided his development 
has been commensurate with his capabilities? Far be it from 
him to make undue claims to superiority; rather let his quiet 
and persuasive speech and demeanor gain for him such recog- 
nition as he deserves. Occasion may demand that he give 
voice to his opinion on matters in which he, as a citizen, 
should be concerned; and maturity of thought and clearness 
of expression, rather than flippancy of speech, should charac- 
terize his utterances. 
While it is admitted that the tendency of those who have 
held long the position of teacher is toward arbitrariness—not 
to say obstinacy of views; while, having so long been accus-
-P-A-G-E-247
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 247 
tomed to obedience to his authority and ready—at least si- 
lent—acceptance of his views, it may be difficult for the 
teacher to hold himself under control when there are those 
who express opposing views, the value of a teacher as a com- 
munity leader is measured by his ability to impress others 
with the sincerity of his motive, the accuracy of his knowledge, 
the altruism of his efforts, the reasonableness of his position, 
and the graciousness of his manner as he sets forth his views. 
Too much emphasis cannot be placed on the fact that peo- 
ple, young and old, appreciate the man that knows, and knows 
that he knows. Some years ago the New York Tribune had 
this to say about Dr. William Matthews, for twelve years 
professor of literature in the University of Chicago: “Dr. 
Matthews appears to have known everybody worth knowing, 
to have seen everything worth seeing, to have read everything 
worth reading, and to have forgotten nothing worth remem- 
bering. Without the garb or the rod of a teacher, he allures 
to the bright realms of literature, and leads the way through 
smooth and delightful paths.” A remarkable tribute was this, 
and yet no one will gainsay that the work and worth of the 
man about whom it was written won for him this enconium. 
When one thinks of it, who is in better position to assure 
high rank in community life than the teacher, especially in 
the public schools? He is the deliberate choice of the school 
board, who thus declare to the community their confidence in 
his ability and his integrity as a man. Right soon he estab- 
lishes himself, if he so wills it, in the good graces of his pupils, 
and from this his entré to home and community life is assured. 
Here is where the young teacher is so likely to make a serious 
mistake. There are to be found in almost every community 
people who are nursing a grievance, real or fancied. The new- 
comer is sure to have his patience put to the test as he listens 
to their tale of woe. Again there may be those who are zeal- 
ots or partisans, and their aim will be to enlist him in their 
views and enroll him under their banner. There comes to 
mind here the admonition of Polonius: 
“Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice; 
Take each man’s censure, but reserve thy judgment ;” 
and it seems to fit in admirably for the guidance of the new 
man in the community.  
-P-A-G-E-248
248 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
No man, however, should be a closer student in community 
affairs than the teacher. If the people therein are live, ener- 
getic and progressive in their ideas, so much the better for 
him. If they are lethargic or indifferent, as the periphery of 
his influence increases, so should the awakening come to those 
on whom it is exercised. If there are vague ideas among them 
about the school and its work, through him must the commu- 
nity directly or indirectly be enlightened. The traditions of 
former days must gradually be supplanted by the verities of 
today; the indifference or opposition on the part of the public 
toward the progress and welfare of the school must give place 
to an awakened sentiment in favor of codperation between 
patron and teacher, having for its end the highest good of the 
pupil. A recent issue of the Winnipeg Saturday Post states: 
“Our schools and our ideas of education are almost as back- 
ward as our penitentiaries and our ideas of crime.” Here 
indeed is a field too long untilled, and one in which the value 
of the teacher as a factor in community life may prove beyond 
estimate. While some may declare that the statement will by 
no means apply to present conditions in the United States, 
who does not admit that there is among us an astounding 
and inexcusable ignorance as to what the schools are really 
accomplishing? 
Again, if there are agencies at work militating against the 
physical, moral or spiritual welfare of the community, who, 
more than the teacher, should be keenly alive to the danger 
that lurks here or unabashed stalks among the people? Who, 
if not he, should be the first to set to work influences that shall 
extirpate these evils ere their strength or numbers so increase 
as to jeopardize or destroy the peace, harmony and welfare of 
the community? Does some timid one shrink from the re- 
sponsibility to be assumed? Then let him in all good con- 
science determine whether or not he measures up to his esti- 
mate of what the province of a teacher really is. It is true 
that he may be a pioneer in the work; the way through the 
wilds must be blazed by him; dangers may beset his path; 
and the hurtling of the storms may threaten his destruction ; 
but who shall say that, for these reasons, he may evade the 
issue and rest content in the thought that what others have 
not done he need not undertake?

In all the walks of life, men here and there have been called 
upon to stand in the forefront and bear the brunt of the con- 
flict, and their victory, though long delayed, has won the ac- 
claim of admiring, but more timid souls. 
“Battles have you and I to fight, and we fight with the souls of men; 
We rise and fall, then we heed the call, 
And rise and fight again. 
We fight for the right, for the sake of the fight, 
And we fight because of hate; 
We stab with wit, and we clinch with grit, 
But we play the game as the rules are writ, 
With never a care for fate.” 
Who does not feel a thrill of admiration for American man- 
hood when the name of Robert Marion LaFollette is men- 
tioned? For years his life has been one fierce struggle for 
purity in politics and the rights of the people against the 
domination of the oppressor. When in 1905 he took his seat 
in the national Senate, he was ostracised by his Republican 
confreres, his opinions were derided, and the bitterness of 
political animosity let no opportunity escape to accomplish 
his downfall. Five or more years past, during which time 
he was known as the “lonely Senator,” and what his thoughts 
and feelings must have been during this time none will ever 
know. But his time has come; after patient waiting he is 
seeing his hopes in a fair way of being realized; men in the 
Senate who were at first wary of him, are now anxious to be 
known as his friends; the sincerity of his conviction, and his 
absolutely impersonal attitude toward matters of national 
concern have won him recognition throughout the land, and 
there are those not slow to declare that his chances for the 
Republican nomination for the presidency of our republic are 
by no means uncertain. But Robert LaFollette was a busy 
man both before and after he entered politics. His profession 
made increasing demands on his time and continual drafts 
on his energy. He did not, however, overlook his duty to his 
community and his commonwealth, neither did he leave the 
work to be done by others. Are there not teachers whose po- 
sitions are such as to give them opportunity to become leaders 
in the highest sense—broad, humanitarian in their attitude; 
optimistic in their conception of community possibilites; mag- 
netic in action and utterance, so as to draw others to them
-P-A-G-E-250
  250 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
and join them to their views; unswerving in their purpose; 
and unwilling to risk their all upon the issue? 
What teacher has had more demands upon him than Thomas 
Woodrow Wilson, and who ever rose with greater nerve to the 
occasion? As teacher, as author, as statesman, and, best of 
all, as private citizen, his record has been one continuous story 
of disinterested ambition-—an ambition to serve his generation 
according to the measure of his gifts? That he is endowed 
above the average may be conceded, but his highest claim to 
public praise is the fact that he knows the value of efficiency 
in every undertaking; no persiflage, no feeble strokes, no vacil- 
lating in purpose, no waste of time in concluding what course 
to pursue, no ambient ways in accomplishing his aim, no 
dread of result when once convinced that he is right. Small 
wonder then that preferment was his, that his community 
loved him, his State admired him, the far-away East should 
desire him, and that now his party would make him the first 
citizen of our republic. 
Examples need not be multiplied. But one conclusion can 
be reached concerning the teacher as a factor in community 
life. He has the right of way to leadership, and no one can 
effectually stay his progress. He himself has been the main 
hindrance to his advancement. The thought that his claims 
might be considered presumptuous, that his position might 
be rendered insecure, that his sphere is limited to the school- 
room, that invidious criticism might be his lot, that after all, 
others might do the work, that the sacrifice is greater than 
he should be called upon to make—these and many other 
equally untenable positions have been taken by him in the 
past. But the dawn if a new day has broken for him. His 
heritage fits him for place and prominence, encouraging words 
come from those who just now are seeing that his importance 
has too long been overlooked; his judgment is being sought; 
his counsel is being followed; and the time is ripe for the 
teacher, deserving the title, to take front rank as a factor in 
community life. (Applause.)

will show you how he can make a sacrifice for the sake of the 
comfort of the Association. It has been found impossible to 
properly heat this hall this morning, so it will be necessary to 
conclude our session as soon as possible. 
In deference to the atmospheric conditions of the building, 
Mr. Richards made no attempt to read his paper, but with a 
good-natured remark or two turned the paper over to the re- 
porter and yielded the floor. His paper follows: 
DIFFICULTIES AND NEEDS OF THE SOUTHERN 
FARMER’S BOY. 
C. W. RICHARDS, ARDMORE, OKLAHOMA. 
It may appear a little incongruous for a man who is super- 
intendent of city schools to discuss the difficulties and needs 
of the farmer’s boy, and yet I think that I shall be justified 
in part at least for making such an attempt when I tell you 
that for twenty-two years I was one of these boys. During 
these years my life experience was very like that of the vast 
majority of boys who have lived close to nature and tickled 
the bosom of mother earth. I experienced their privations 
and hardships, felt their loneliness and emptiness of life, and 
knew their disappointments, their joys and their sorrows. 
These early experiences have ever caused my sympathy and in- 
terest to go out to the country boy and produced a desire 
within me to do something that would improve his condition 
there. 
The welfare of this class of young people constitutes what 
is possibly the greatest problem confronting the people of the 
South today. It is important because of the large number 
belonging to this class—there being three millions three hun- 
dred sixty thousand of these boys of school age. Next it is 
important because in his veins flows the purest strains of 
Anglo-Saxon blood to be found in any part of this country. 
It is also important because of the wonderful progress and 
achievements of these boys in the past and the splendid part 
they have played in the development of this country in spite 
of their great disadvantages and many handicaps. However, 
it is not my purpose to pass enconiums upon them for what 
they are and what they have done, but rather to point out
-P-A-G-E-252
  252. SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
their difficulties and needs in such a way that we may under- 
stand the problem of preparing them for a larger service and 
a larger usefulness as demanded by our modern civilization. 
Before we can do this it is necessary for us to get in a very 
large degree his view-point of the world as it comes to him 
through his environment. It is also necessary for us to under- 
stand what the world is demanding of him, and after under- 
standing these two things we must know how best to get be- 
fore him that training which will best fit him to meet the de- 
mands which the world is making upon him in our present 
day civilization. 
The home, the school and the church are the three great in- 
stitutions which are chiefly responsible for the education of 
childhood. Through these the child must get a great deal of 
the many-sided experience of the race which constitutes a large 
part of his education. These institutions must bring to him 
those life experiences which are noble and elevating in their 
tendencies and keep away from him those experiences which 
are ignoble and degrading in their nature. Each has its 
work to do in this educational process. If any one of them 
fails to do its part, then the burden falls heavier upon the 
other two. If two of them fail to contribute their part toward 
the education of the child, the burden becomes still heavier 
upon the one. But if all three fail to do their full duty by 
the child, then he must of necessity go through life handi- 
capped in the struggle for existence. Then not only does the 
individual suffer, but society as a whole is made to sustain a 
loss economically, intellectually and spiritually. 
These things being true, let us consider the work of these 
three institutions as they exist in the life of the farmer’s boy, 
and thus we shall be able to determine some of his difficulties 
and some of his needs. 
When we come to consider his home life we are brought 
face to face with a very large number of his gravest difficulties. 
As a rule his parents have not had the advantage of very 
much education. Their training has been obtained largely 
from tradition and their own life experience. This of neces- 
sity makes it narrow and causes them to do things very much 
as they were done by their ancestors. Their ideas are in a 
large degree traditional and provincial. With these the child
-P-A-G-E-253
     
       JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 
  253 
is to a large extent bound down and his own life experience 
circumscribed. In homes of this kind it becomes necessary 
for the boy just as soon as he is at all large enough to begin 
to contribute to the support of the family. This in a measure 
deprives him of many of the experiences of childhood to which 
he is entitled, and prematurely lays upon him responsibilities 
too grave for his years and his experience. [ realize the im- 
portance of early in life giving the child that training which 
comes from the assuming of responsibility, but in a very large 
per cent of the cases of boys raised on the farm, these respon- 
sibilities are few and of such a nature as to be narrowing and 
of such a hundrum monotony as to make his work a drudgery. 
He has entirely too few diversions. There is very little of the 
best literature found in the home and often still less encour- 
agement from parents and opportunities given for the reading 
of that which may be found there. In many of these homes 
anything is considered good enough for the boy while the best 
of everything is given to the girl. He is required to contrib- 
ute toward giving her the best to be obtained, and very often 
when the family finances are limited, he is required to work 
and assist in making it possible for her to go to college and 
there receive that training and culture which educates her out 
of her class. Educated and cultured mothers are very much 
to be desired, but we should see to it that we have educated 
fathers who shall have a much larger earning capacity than 
the majority of our Southern farmers have today. 
If we turn to the church, we find that conditions there are 
in many cases not so good as are found in the home. The 
buildings as a rule are very poor and unattractive. Services 
are held there only once a month. Ministers of these churches 
are often men who are forced to follow some other occupation 
in order that they may make a living for those dependent upon 
them. Therefore, they have very little time for the study of 
God’s word or the spiritual needs of their congregation. The 
boy who is raised in this community finds nothing about the 
services of the church to attract him or to enlarge his views 
and elevate his ideals of the spiritual life. Hence this side of 
his nature is impoverished and stinted in its growth. 
But we as educators should be especially interested in the 
third of these institutions which is responsible for the devel-    
    
-P-A-G-E-254
254 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  opment of childhood—the school. If there is one of these in- 
stitutions that is failing more than the others to do its full 
duty by the Southern farmer’s boy it seems to me that it is the 
school. It is failing in many respects. The buildings, as a 
rule, are very poor and in many instances are very unsightly. 
Where there is any equipment at all it is of the poorest, so 
that there is nothing about the physical environment to at- 
tract the average country boy. He is forced to go long dis- 
tances through muddy and often almost impassible roads 
which tend to discourage rather than hearten him for school 
work. Possibly in a majority of cases when he reaches the 
school building he is greeted by a teacher who taught his fa- 
ther and whose educational interest has never gone beyond the 
meager school warrant which he received for teaching from 
three to five months of the year; or, perhaps, this teacher is 
one of the girls of the community who was a very bright girl 
and led her classes in school and whose employment has been 
a favor to some influential man in the community; or, again, 
she may be a young girl who has been raised in the city or 
town who desires to make some money of her own with which 
to buy a more elaborate trousseau, whose life experience is 
entirely foreign to that of the children whom she is teaching, 
who has no interest in nor conception of how to prepare them 
for the largest life possible that they may live there in that 
community. As she hears the recitations of each day she 
teaches books and not subjects, and as she teaches the book 
she stands before the class with one hand on the text and 
with the other she points the girls and boys of that commu- 
nity to the city or town. As a result of this kind of teaching 
we see the boys and girls of the country turning their faces 
from the farm toward the city and great numbers of them 
are pouring into these centers of population every year. 
Another defect of the rural school is the curriculum or the 
subject-matter taught in them. Here we find served up from 
day to day and year to year that same mental pabulum which 
has been served to young minds ever since the middle ages 
and very little recognition given to the needs of the eyer- 
changing civilization in which we live and the demands which 
it is making upon the youth of our Southland today. 
Thus the training which he receives is of such a nature as
-P-A-G-E-255
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 255, 
to cause him to be narrow in his ideals, aims, and purposes 
and at the same time to be strong in his likes and his dislikes, 
to have strong friendships and prejudices and very decided 
convictions. Therefore his chief difficulty lies in the fact that 
the institutional life about him is so constituted that it does 
not bring to his life experience a sufficient amount of the life 
experience of the race, and for this reason he is unable to meet 
the larger demands made upon him by our modern civilization 
or to function to the largest good of which he is capable in his 
own sphere in life today. 
We have now spoken of some of the difficulties confronting 
the Southern farmer’s boy many of which suggest accom- 
paning needs. But let us now turn specifically to some things 
which he needs to fit him properly for his sphere in life. 
First, I should say that he needs a home life which contains 
more diversions than it now has. Fathers and mothers should 
give more attention to providing pleasures and entertainments 
in the home for boys which will be wholesome and attractive. 
Such as will attract the boy to the home and cause him to en- 
joy the home life; such as will give him proper ideals of social 
relations and such as will deter him from any forms of ex- 
cess and abuse. It is in the home that he is to largely re- 
ceive such training as will fit him for ideal home life and do- 
mestic felicity. As much thoughtful care should be given to 
preparing him for a larger and more useful life as is given to 
his sister in order that the progress of the two sexes may be 
uniform and consistent. 
Next, the country church must provide more attractive 
houses of worship and then set apart men who shall devote 
all of their time and talents to the study of their profession 
and to the spiritual needs of the people of the community. 
The worship must be so changed as to be attractive to these 
boys and to be in accord with the demands of our modern 
civilization. The services here must be such as will appeal to 
the country boy and give him training in the work of the 
church. That form of worship which appeals to the adult 
and mature mind will not appeal to the young, immature 
mind; therefore, more attention should be given to that form 
of worship which appeals to him. 
But the greatest number of his needs and those which go
-P-A-G-E-256
    256 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
farthest toward preparing him properly for the larger life 
which the farmer of the South is to live in the future are 
found in connection with our rural schools. The burden of cor- 
recting many of the defects of the home and the church in a 
large measure rests upon the schools, at least to the extent of 
taking the initiative in these reforms. Besides that, we must 
have larger and better equipped school buildings in rural dis- 
tricts, and this equipment made to meet the needs of rural 
schools and not such as is used in our city schools. Next the 
teachers of these schools must be so trained that they thor- 
oughly understand and are in sympathy with rural life. If 
possible these should have been raised in the country and be- 
fore beginning the work of teaching they should take a course 
in a normal school or a teachers’ training school which offers 
such courses as will especially prepare and equip them for 
understanding rural conditions and rural problems. She 
should be a teacher who is thoroughly in sympathy with rural 
life and filled with a desire to improve its condition. 
Another thing, the course of study offered in these schools 
should be very different from that offered in city schools. It 
should be such as will present to the child the very best that 
is to be found in the life experiences of the farm. The sub- 
jects taught here should relate to farm life and should be 
presented in the light of this life. So much has been said and 
written in recent years about teaching agriculture, horticulture, 
animal husbandry, fruit raising, seed selection, etc., in our rural 
schools that I shall not make any repetition of these things 
here. But I do desire to say that these subjects should be 
taught by teachers who are capable of presenting them in such 
a thorough and attractive way that the boy on the farm may 
appreciate the dignity of farm life end that it may become so 
attractive to him that he will be entirely content to remain 
on the farm and dignify the life there. 
Elbert Hubbard tells this story. A few years ago a convict 
served out his sentence and was released from the penitentiary 
in New York. For three days he walked the streets of Buffalo 
seeking employment, but no one would hire him because he 
was an ex-convict. At last some one suggested that he go 
over to East Aurora, and that possibly he could secure work 
there. The next day he walked from Buffalo to East Aurora
-P-A-G-E-257

reaching there near sunset. He sought out Mr. Hubbard, meet- 
ing him in the path as he was returning from the field. The 
convict asked if this was Mr. Hubbard. On being told that 
it was, he said, “I want work.” Mr. Hubbard told him that 
he was sorry, but that they had nothing there that he could 
do. The convict straightened up and said, “Give me a chance,” 
to which Mr. Hubbard replied as before, but with more em- 
phasis. Then the convict squared himself in front of him and 
said with all the force of his being, “Give me a chance.” Mr. 
Hubbard said that he had to give him a chance or run, so he 
told him to come down to the shops next morning and he would 
let him break rock. The next morning the man was there 
before time to begin. When the whistle blew that evening 
the others came into the shop and asked who that man was 
out there breaking rock. He told them to tell the man to 
come into the shop, and there he told him that when the 
whistle blew he should quit work. Mr. Hubbard said that the 
fellow continued faithful at his task breaking rock from day 
to day until at last one day he found him in the shop handling 
tools and that he was expert with their use. So he took him 
off the rock pile and put him in the shop. He said that this 
man had continued faithful in his work and that he has con- 
tinued to rise in the work there until now if anything gets 
wrong with any of the work there the boys all go to this man 
and ask for his advice, and Mr. Hubbard said that if anything 
should happen to him or he should suddenly drop off there 
is only one man who could take up the work at East Aurora 
and carry it on as he is doing and that is the man who met him 
in the path that evening and said, “Give me a chance.” 
My friends, this farmer’s boy of the South has been working 
against heavy odds in this country for many years. He has 
continued faithfully working at his task and has made wonder- 
ful progress. But today he is calling to you and to me in no 
uncertain tones, “Give me a chance for a larger and a fuller 
life.” Let us do it.

“PUTTING ON THE TROLLEY.” 
DR. J. W. NICHOLSON. 
Mr. President, Fellow Teachers, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
I was once shown what appeared to be two grains of wheat. 
One of them was an artificial grain, made of wheat dough, 
but so much was it like the natural grain in size, color and 
shape that I could not tell the one from the other. The chief 
difference between them was that the one had life, and the 
other had not. Although this difference, life, was: invisible, 
imponderable and intangible, yet what a mighty difference it 
was! If an electrician could have flashed into the artificial 
grain the spark of life, he would have imparted to it creative 
energy, and the capacity of endless reproduction. That one 
sterile grain could have been made to feed the world. What a 
wonderful thing is life! 
THE TROLLEY. 
  My subject on this occasion is, “Putting on the Trolley,” 
and in illustration of its significance let me relate a little 
incident. I was once riding on an electric car when, appar- 
ently without cause, its speed began to slacken’ and soon it 
stopped altogether. Some one within inquired, “What is the 
matter?” Some one without replied, “The trolley is off the 
wire.” Of course if the trolley was off the wire the car had 
to stop, for the trolley is the medium through which the elec- 
tricity makes the car move. In short, the trolley forms the 
connection between mechanism and life. Note that, in the 
movement of the car, the two things of primary importance 
were efficient machinery and adequate force; but however 
efficient the one and adequate the other. there was no progress 
-without the trolley. The trolley gave life by the establishment 
of a sensitive reciprocity between the things connected, thus 
uniting the whole, as it were, into a common living sensorium, 
A COMPREHENSIVE THEME. 
Figuratively, these three factors, machinery, trolley and 
force, constitute the essentials to success in all the projects of
-P-A-G-E-259
JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGS. 259 
commerce, education and industry. For example, a business 
man needs the machinery of method and the force of principle; 
but these, however good within themselves, will be unavailing 
unless articulated as members of the same living body. This 
articulation is the trolley. Again, in the work of education, 
the pupil may have the machinery of capacity and the teacher 
the power of knowledge, but there will be no real growth with- 
out the trolley by which the receptivity of the one becomes 
responsive to the scintillation of the other. 
Evidently, the theme is a comprehensive one. No satisfac- 
tory discussion of it can be pressed into the narrow limits of 
the time assigned. From the standpoint of popularity this 
enforced brevity may not be objectionable, because a speech is 
like a wheel, the longer the “spoke” the greater the “tire.” 
In any event, I beg you to consider my statements rather as 
hints, intended to awaken a deeper interest and stimulate 
a broader inquiry. 
THE IMPORTANT QUESTION. 
  Without defining education, suffice it to say it may stand 
for culture, as is largely the case in England; or it may stand 
for scholarship, as is largely the case in Germany; or it may 
stand for efficiency, as is largely the case in the United States. 
But whatever it may stand for, the question of primary impor- 
tance is how to connect, as by a trolley, the teacher and the 
pupil. Or, to be more precise, how is the teacher to touch, 
quicken and expand the powers of the pupils, and implant in 
them facts, truths and principles in such a manner that they 
will be absorbed and assimilated. This is an old theme. It 
has engaged the attention of the most thoughtful minds of all 
ages and lands. Since the dawn of civilization, psychologists, 
sages and philosophers have poured upon it a steady stream 
of intelligent and relentless inquiry. What I am about to tell 
you has been told substantially to countless generations. Bar- 
ring fads, whims and sensationalisms, there is almost nothing 
new in educational matter and methods. The great need of 
the times is not new things, but old things simplified, vitalized 
and adapted to modern conditions. As to the facts, I lay no 
claim to novelty or originality, except probably in the manner 
of their presentation and coérdination.
-P-A-G-E-260

FUNDAMENTAL PREREQUISITES. 
  The first prerequisites are that the teacher must have a thor- 
ough knowledge of the subject taught and an abiding confi- 
dence in the capacity of the pupil. But, however thorough 
the one and strong the other, these will be inefficient without 
an earnest and unwavering interest in the work. Indeed, if 
there is one thing which, more than all others, forms the 
trolley, it is the teacher’s interest in the work—an interest 
springing out of a love for the subject and a positive delight 
in teaching it. In this, as in every other human undertaking, 
interest is life. The farmer, or merchant, or doctor who takes 
an active and intelligent interest in his work succeeds; and all 
enterprises fail where this interest is wanting. A proper 
interest in the work will inspire the teacher to study and 
profit by the teachings and experience of others. The best 
known normal and psychological methods of reaching and 
quickening that volition of the pupil’s mind which makes it 
a motive power will be earnestly sought. Furthermore, they 
will be readily apprehended and appropriated by the interested 
teacher; for, as to method, the drift of all live teachers is in 
the same direction, and they easily understand one another. 
Again, interest on the part of the teacher begets interest on 
the part of the pupil. While I do not wholly indorse the old 
saying, “As the teacher is, so is the pupil,’ I do believe that 
the pupils absorb much of the animus of the teacher. Let me 
tell you a little story and leave you to make the application: 
A gentleman living down in the swamps of Louisiana, where 
the mosquitoes are large and plentiful, had an old negro serv- 
ant named Sam. A friend asked old Sam if his master was 
not terribly annoyed by the mosquitoes. “No, sur,” said Sam. 
“You see, tis dis way. Ebery ebenin’ Marse George is so ’toxi- 
cated he don’t mind the skeeters, and ebery mornin’ the skeeters 
is so ’toxicated they don’t mind Marse George.” 
Similarly, a pupil imbibes the interest of the teacher; and 
without this interest on the part of the pupil very little per- 
manent good is accomplished. The mind is strengthened and 
enriched, not by the information which it receives from an- 
other, but by its own action on what it does receive. The 
worth of knowledge is to be measured by the energy with which 
it is sought and employed. “A bird may be shot upward by
-P-A-G-E-261
  JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGS. 261 
some external force,” says Dr. Channing, “but it rises in the 
true sense only when it spreads its own wings and soars by its 
own living power.” 
The unfolding of the subject is to be made attractive to the 
pupil to the end that his desire to know more of it may be en- 
kindled and stimulated. The capacity of the pupil is thus 
put in a state of receptivity, and the seeds of knowledge im- 
planted therein take root and grow. His reaction on the sub- 
ject taught is manifested in the amount of interest shown on 
his part, and in the measure of his codperation with the 
teacher. Fortunate is the teacher who stimulates this co- 
operation with the result of an increasing vitality and an en- 
larged capacity on the part of both himself and the pupil. Ia 
a word, the teacher who is imbued with a proper interest in 
his work will sooner or later change the attitude of a class 
from the static to the dynamic. 
THE PUPIL IS THE EDUCATOR. 
That the pupil is the educator cannot be emphasized too 
strongly. It is a misnomer to call the teacher an educator. 
No person can educate another one. Every man educates him- 
self, if any education is accomplished. The pupil learns to do 
things by doing them. The teacher is merely the instructor, 
and he can no more teach children how to solve problems, 
construct sentences, or analyze soils and flowers by instruc- 
tion than he can teach them how to ride a bicycle or play on a 
piano by telling them how to do it. The teacher should re- 
gard the pupil as the educator, and his highest aim should be 
to teach the pupil how to educate himself. To use a very 
forceful expression common among teamsters, the pupil should 
always be “worked in the lead;” and the function of the 
teacher should be to quicken, stimulate and guide. In thus 
working the pupil “in the lead,” the objects should be to train 
him in the disposition and habit of taking the initiative, im- 
press upon him the necessity and power of using previously 
acquired knowledge, and enkindle and develop his resources 
of invention. 
WORK AND EXERTION. 
There is a vast difference between work and exertion. Work 
involves exertion, but exertion is not always work. According
-P-A-G-E-262
262 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
to mechanics, work is performed only when the object acted 
upon is moved. A man pushing all day against an immovable 
stump or wall does no work. The car which sustains the 
burden of the passengers does no work unless some force puts 
it in motion. Similarly, the mere loading of the pupil’s mind 
with facts and truths is not doing educational work. It is 
simply exertion on the part of both teacher and pupil. Such 
knowledge is evanescent. It soon vanishes, leaving the higher 
powers of the pupil unstimulated and unstrengthened. It is 
only when the pupil is moved to act upon what he receives, 
making it a part of himself by diligent study and application, 
that any uplifting results are achieved. Exertion is to be en- 
couraged, for without it there can be no work. How to arouse 
the pupil to exertion, and how to put the trolley on between 
exertion and work, are ends well worthy of the best efforts of 
the teacher. 
WORK AND PLAY. 
  The disposition of children to play is fundamental. It was 
implanted in them for wise and beneficent purposes. Children 
turn to play like the opening flower to the morning sun. 
Under its spell their interest is awakened and their percep- 
tions quickened. Nerves, muscles, and faculties throb for 
movement and action. As to methods of teaching, the ideal 
will be attained when the trolley'is put on between play and 
useful work. Propelled by this stimulus, exertion would be 
voluntary and work persistent. Already much has been done 
in this articulation of play and work. The time once was 
when work and play were thought to be incompatible with 
each other. That old-time doctrine is being demolished by 
our progressive modern methods. Whether in the schoolroom, 
on the farm, or in the workshop, work is most efficient when it 
has in it an element of play, just as play is most enjoyable 
when it involves exertion. “Of all the combinations of our 
age,” says Dr. Hadley, “we have here the profoundest—that 
combination which does away with the distinction of work 
time and play time, and which makes all life a harmony rather 
than a conflict between pleasure and duty.” 
This disposition to articulate work and play is one of most 
prominent, as well as promising, signs of the times. It is to 
be seen more or less in all departments of modern educational
-P-A-G-E-263
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 263 
  work. In the classroom and laboratory the up-to-date teacher 
strives to fuse labor and pleasure, earnestness and cheerful- 
ness, making each contributory to the other. Cheerfulness is 
as helpful to thought digestion as to food digestion. A short 
story told in illustration of a point or lesson quickens inter- 
est, removes obscurity and monotony, and give zest to the 
pupil and life to the recitation. This is my reason and my 
apology for whatever of humor I inject into lectures and ad- 
dresses. 
In the estimation of some people it is undignified to inject 
funny stories into serious lectures and discourses. Of dig- 
nity, I shall have something to say further on. Suffice it here 
to say that nothing is more hurtful to the trolley that should 
connect the teacher and the pupil than too much formality 
and dignity. Humor is one of man’s most fruitful endow- 
ments, and education can serve no higher end than quickening 
and fostering it. The best advice Dickens ever gave the world 
was, “Keep jolly.” The lesson of all his immortal writings 
is: Every situation in life has its funny side—learn to see 
that side. Unfortunate, indeed, is the teacher in whom the 
sense of humor has become atrophied for want of use, like 
the eyes of the mole and of fish that inhabit the waters of ray- 
less caverns. What a poor stimulus it is to Moses, when the 
teacher on telling him to “Go to the board,” does it in a tone 
and manner which seem to say, “Man that is born of a woman 
is of few days, and full of trouble.” 
Almost as much attention is now given to games on the 
campus as to lessons in the classrooms. Teachers have learned 
that football, baseball, tennis, etc., are not only safety valves 
and schools for the development of bones and muscles, but 
under the proper direction, lead naturally to the laboratory 
and workshop, and give impetus to the movement, everywhere 
prevalent, of amalgamating work and play. Indeed, of the 
academic and athletic departments, it is difficult to tell which 
is dominating the other. It reminds me of an old story. An 
old darky, sitting in a light canoe, was fishing just off the coast 
of Florida. He hung a large tarpon, and the fish made out to 
sea;.and as he carried the canoe and the darky along at a 
fearful rate, the old negro exclaimed: “What I want to know, 
is dis nigger er fishin’, or is dis fish er niggerin’?”

SIMPLICITY AND DIGNITY. 
  People differ in their ideas of dignity and simplicity. Some 
associate dignity with a formal reserve or pomous mummery, 
with elevation in rank or position, and simplicity with com- 
monness or vulgarity. Whatever dignity and simplicity may 
stand for with kings or slaves, and however much they may 
differ essentially in military and court affairs, they should be 
one and the same in the classroom. To the teacher simplicity 
and dignity are alike indispensable, provided they are so ar- 
ticulated that each gives inspiration and strength to the other. 
Simplicity of bearing is essential to a free communication be- 
tween teacher and pupil; simplicity of language is necessary 
to render instruction intelligible to the opening mind; and a 
certain dignity is necessary for the teacher to command the 
respect of the pupil, and impress upon him the worth and no- 
bility of knowledge and character. Putting on the trolley be- 
tween simplicity and dignity is not only a brace to both, but 
it makes each a check on the excesses of the other. Therefore, 
the ideal teacher is he in whom dignity and simplicity are so 
harmoniously blended that it is difficult to tell where the one 
begins and the other ends. 
If straightness and stiffness of person alone constitute dig- 
nity, the most dignified man in the world is a dead man. 
During the reign of King Charles II, Dr. Busby was head- 
master of Westminster School. On one occasion the king vis- 
ited the school, and the doctor, in great dignity, strutted’ 
through the school with his hat on his head, while his majesty 
walked complacently behind him with his own hat under his 
arm. But when the king was taking his leave, the doctor, 
apologizing to him, said: “I should never be able to rule my 
boys if they ever once got the impression that there is a greater 
man in the kingdom than myself.” It might not be advisable 
nowadays to put a trolley between a pupil and a teacher of 
that kind. Naturally such exponents of education thrived in 
the feudal ages, but fortunately they are passing away under 
the onward march of broader pedagogical attainments and 
higher democratic ideals. 
Nothing is more absurd and grotesque than the association 
of profound learning with pomposity and a spirit of vainglory, 
In proportion as one is thoroughly educated does he see the
-P-A-G-E-265
  
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 265 
comparative narrowness of human attainments. The more 
one really knows, the more clearly does he see how little he 
does know. Let me give you an illustration. As the tourist 
ascends the mountain, new and more distant scenes open to 
his view, and these in turn disclose an ever widening region 
that lies beyond the range of his vision. Precisely so in learn- 
ing; as man mounts to loftier and loftier heights, or penetrates 
to deeper depths, he is more and more impressed with the lit- 
tleness of what is behind and the vastness of what is beyond. 
Truly the road to learning leads to humility and simplicity. 
How fortunate it would be if our lives could begin in wisdom 
and end in simplicity, instead of the reverse, which now ob- 
tains. “When I was a young man,” says a venerable savant, 
“T despised incapabilities; as I grew in years and wisdom I 
came to pity them; now in my riper years I have for them a 
sympathetic feeling of brotherhood; I have learned that we 
all are incapables, differing only in degree.” 
CULTURE AND PRACTICALITY. 
Before the Civil War education in the United States stood 
for culture. In the colleges the course of study consisted 
largely of Latin, Greek and mathematics; and the secondary 
schools were organized mainly to meet the demands of the 
higher institutions. The chief purpose was to train and de- 
velop memory and reflection, reason and imagination, senti- 
ment and ideals. The system well subserved the purposes for 
which it was intended. Probably no better could be devised 
for the education of lawyers, ministers, and statesmen. There 
is in it that which appeals especially to us sentimental and 
idealistic Southern people—a splendor which charms and awes 
us. Its moulding forces gave to the Old South her great 
orators and statesmen, ministers and patriots. Among its 
eminent products were Jefferson and Madison, Calhoun and 
Stephens, Palmer and Pierce. 
But with all its merits, that system of education was illy 
adapted to the promotion of the industries and scientific agri 
culture. It built no mills or factories, spindles or looms, fur- 
naces or forges; none of the mechanical contrivances that help 
io swell the grand whole of private and public prosperity. 
The Old South abounded in spiritual development, but her 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
266 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
boundless material resources lay undeveloped in her hills and 
valleys, in her forests and fisheries. Recently the South has 
caught the practical spirit of the age. Her schools are now 
being organized on the basis that men and women must live 
in order to act and improve; that there is a primary necessity 
for that information and skill by which subsistence is earned 
and life preserved. The South is now educating her children 
to meet the practical exigencies of life, realizing that it means 
for the masses better food and clothes, better sanitary condi- 
tions, and more time for reading and improvement. Every- 
where she is putting on the trolley between culture and prac- 
ticality. In the higher institutions the microscope, the lab- 
oratory, and the machine shop go hand in hand with litera- 
ture, language, and political economy; and the secondary 
schools are extending their courses in the rudiments of prac- 
tical agriculture, industry, and mechanics. The most hopeful 
sign of the times is the growing tendency of education to touch, 
uplift, and develop all that is best in the race, and at the same 
time train the pupils in the self-helpful means of subsistence, 
and in all the useful and mechanical arts by which the re- 
sources of a country are developed. 
This means a new era for the South. In diversity and fer- 
tility of soil, in diversity and healthfulness of climate, in abun- 
dance and variety of minerals, in forests and fisheries, in water 
power and fuel, the South is rich beyond the power to calcu- 
late. The one thing heretofore lacking was agricultural, in- 
dustrial, and mechanical training and skill. Supply her with 
this, as is now being done, and she is destined to become the 
most prosperous land on the face of the earth. (Applause.)

RESOLUTIONS. 
The Southern, Educational Association, now holding its twenty-second 
annual session at Houston, Texas, desires to extend its thanks to the 
press, the citizens, the city government, the School Board, the Superin- 
tendent of City Schools, and the teachers of the city and to the manage- 
ment of the Majestic Theater and the trustees of the First Methodist 
Church for the gracious courtesy and hospitality extended to the mem- 
bers of the Association and for the substantial contribution made to 
the success of the meeting. The Association desires to place on record 
its hearty appreciation of the good work done by its officers in arrang- 
ing for this meeting and carrying it to a successful issue and especially 
in response to a vote of the Board of Directors, of the energetic, thor- 
ough and effective work of its Secretary. 
We affirm our faith in the efficacy of the public schools, properly or- 
ganized, conducted and maintained, to prepare the boys and girls of the 
South for good citizenship and our belief that universal education sup- 
ported by State and local taxation is necessary to the highest and best 
democracy. The public schools should give equal opportunity to all the 
children for industrial, civic, intellectual and moral training, and there 
should be a closer articulation between practical life and the school 
process of education in all grades and kinds of schools. 
We believe the special consideration given in the discussion of this 
meeting to the education of the Southern girl, the country child, the 
mountain child, the factory child and the negro child, indicates the line 
of special effort by the educational forces of the South. The Southern 
girl should be given an education that will fit her for all the duties of 
life, for home-making and social service, as well as for school-teaching, 
bread-winning and society, and as much money should be expended upon 
her education as upon that of the Southern boy.
-P-A-G-E-269
  JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGS. 269 
The country child and the mountain child should be given that edu- 
cation which will fit them for the duties of life in their environment. 
In a region so largely agricultural as our own, it is imperative that 
agricultural education should have its rightful place in the instruction 
of the rural population and we heartily commend the efforts of the many 
agencies now at work to give training in this and allied subjects to the 
children in the rural districts. 
The proper education of the mountain child presents a serious and 
important problem to the South. The conservation of the great mineral 
and timber wealth of the mountains of the South has engaged the ear- 
nest thought of our leaders’ in every walk of life, but the conservation 
of the child of the mountains is of vastly more importance than that of 
their natural resources. 
We earnestly urge upon those to whom this kind of education is 
entrusted, a full recognition of the problem and a vigorous effort to 
meet and solve it. | 
The factory community, being rapidly multiplied throughout the 
South, has produced peculiar social conditions for the factory child 
which require special study and special educational effort. It is ear- 
nestly hoped that the factory child will receive that training which will 
make him a self-respecting, moral, useful member of society. 
We reaffirm our conviction that the welfare of the white people of 
the Southern States requires the proper education and training of the 
youth of the negro race. Under present conditions the efforts of the 
State should be largely and immediately directed to the training of the 
negro youth in those practical industries which directly affect his 
physical welfare, such as agriculture, gardening, poultry-raising, cooking 
and the arts of thrift and economy. Instruction in hygiene and sani- 
tation is of paramount importance. Unless the negro home is made 
clean and sanitary, our efforts to protect our homes from contagion and 
to eliminate disease from our cities and towns must remain futile. 
We heartily endorse the general movement for public health and 
urge in all quarters that special emphasis be put upon such instruction 
and such regulation in connection with public and private education in 
the South as will provide for the preservation of the health of the 
people and for the abolition of preventable diseases. 
We place ourselves on record as fully and strongly endorsing the 
movement for school peace leagues, assured that they will ultimately 
result in the development of a strong public opinion for peace and 
exert a mighty influence for the termination of war among men, Be- 
lieving that the ratification of the pending arbitration treaties by the 
United States Senate will be a great service to the world and promote 
the moral leadership of our country in the cause of international jus- 
tice, we urge our Senators from the Southern States to use their in- 
fluence to secure their ratification. 
We endorse again the Dolliver-Davis Bill introduced anew in the 
United States Senate by Senator Page as a measure calculated to pro-

mote most effectually and practically the secondary industrial training 
of both races. 
We endorse the rural night school as a practical plan of reducing 
adult illiteracy in the South. We commend it to superintendents and 
teachers of the South for trial. 
As the character and efficiency of the schools depend on the char- 
acter and efficiency of the teachers, we earnestly urge that greater and 
better provision be made for the training of teachers for all the schools 
and that the teachers’ salaries be made commensurate with salaries 
paid in other professions in order that men and women of the highest 
intellectual attainments, broadest culture, most thorough training and 
loftiest ideals may be secured and retained for the teaching profession. 
We heartily endorse the movement for good roads, recognizing the 
interrelation of good roads and good schools and also the relation of 
good roads to the economic and social uplift of the people. 
We heartily appreciate the appointment by the President of the 
United States of Dr. P. P. Claxton, a member and former President of 
this Association, as United States Commissioner of Education. Coming 
from the South as he does, he is thoroughly acquainted with Southern 
educational conditions, and because of the great development, economic 
and educational, going on in this large and important part of our 
common country, he is prepared to render most vital service to this sec- 
tion as well as to the whole country. We want to pledge him our 
hearty support in measures for the public welfare and to urge upon 
Congress such appropriations as will enable him to properly carry on 
the great and growing work committed to his important department.

Committee on Resolutions, 
  Moved by C. W. Richards that the resolutions as read be 
adopted. Motion seconded. : 
Moved by E. 8. Richardson, of Louisana, to amend the reso- 
lution endorsing the Dolliver-Davis bill so as to go on record 
as favoring National aid, but not specifying any certain bill. 
Dr. JoHnson: As Chairman of the committee, I will say 
that this Association is already on record as having endorsed 
this bill. The Association adopted this resolution last year 
in Chattanooga, and it seems to be the only practical thing

offered just now. If there are any other bills looking toward 
this end, I do not know of them. I am a member of the Na- 
tional Committee of Representatives of all the Southern States 
which is back of this practical effort in this direction. This 
bill provides for secondary agricultural schools and also pro- 
vides for work through existing State Normal Schools. The 
A. & M. Colleges of the South have been receiving Federal aid 
for this work for years. This bill provides for the first time 
for the training of the women through the State Normal 
Schools of the South. It does not provide for separate insti- 
tutions. There is no proposition of the United States Govern- 
ment coming into the States and trying to run their schools. 
I have the latest bill, and it is the only practical thing offered. 
This is a practical way now proposed for National aid in this 
line, and we should therefore put ourselves again on record as 
favoring it, for we want something. 
Dr. Wuirrietp: The issue is simply this, as I see it: Aid 
has in several ways been given to the agricultural colleges 
and they have done a great work. This proposes to aid va- 
rious individual colleges of the South to send out women 
equipped to do for the homes of the State what the men have 
done for the farms. The issue is whether it shall be left to 
the agricultural colleges, their getting it all and leaving the 
women out. Those in favor of giving the women an oppor- 
tunity to do this work will vote against the amendment. 
Upon being put to vote, the amendment was declared lost. 
Vote being taken upon the motion to adopt the resolutions 
as reported, the same were declared adopted. 
Mr. Richards, Chairman of the Committee on Necrology, 
stated that it had been impossible for the committee to obtain 
necessary information in the time at its command and asked 
for further time. 
Tue Cuan: As President of the Association, I will exer- 
cise the privilege of extending the time of this committee until 
the next meeting of the Association, in order that it may be 
able to make a proper report upon deceased members. The 
committee will therefore be continued until the next meeting.

called earlier this morning, but my absence was due to a mis- 
understanding as to the program for the morning, I having 
been assigned a place on the afternoon program. I was to have 
presented a paper on “A Constructive Library Platform for 
Southern Schools,” and I want to call attention to the fact 
that the paper will be published in the proceedings. Very 
probably, had I been here I would have been called upon, with 
others, to sacrifice my time for the comfort of the audience, 
which I would most gladly have done. But I hope the paper 
may be of some value in emphasizing the necessity of better 
libraries in connection with our rural schools. 
After announcing that there would be no further session 
until evening, the Chair declared the session adjourned. 
A CONSTRUCTIVE LIBRARY PLATFORM FOR SOUTH- 
ERN SCHOOLS. 
LOUIS ROUND WILSON, CHAPEI. HILL, N. C. 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
In a gathering of men and women assembled to discuss mat- 
ters pertaining to the advancement of general education, it 
may seem inappropriate to raise the question whether or not 
the modern library, whatever its form, is considered seriously 
as a helpful, constructive, educative agent. Upon first thought 
such a question seems wholly uncalled Yor. Its answer in the 
affirmative is so obvious that no good reason is apparent to jus- 
tify its asking. This seemingly is especially true so far as the 
Southern Educational Association is concerned; for it has ex- 
pressed itself unmistakably as to its conception of the impor- 
tance of the library as an educational influence by providing 
in its constitution for a library department and by giving a 
place in its general program for the discussion of vital library 
topics. Furthermore, as members, we have written laws pro- 
viding for the establishment of rural school libraries from 
Maryland to this great State, and all of us who, in our child- 
hood years, hung upon our mothers’ lips as we heard of fairies 
and princes, or in our early teens followed the heroes of Cooper 
and Stevenson across the printed page, or in our maturer years 
have felt the ennobling, vitalizing influence of some great book, 
need no argument to win us to a belief in the library. We know
-P-A-G-E-273
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 273 
it is an indispensable agent in any educational system and 
absolutely so in one from which broad culture and enduring 
satisfactions are to be derived. 
Such, seemingly, is true, and yet, with no spirit of fault 
finding, but rather with rejoicing that every Southern State 
has made provision in its laws for school libraries and with a 
desire that we may not fall into error by taking for granted 
what may not in the fullest sense be true, I ask the question in 
all seriousness, and I believe with justifiable appropriateness, 
if an analysis of library conditions now prevailing in the South 
and for which we are largely responsible, will show our works 
in full accord with the profession of our faith. Are we, as 
educators, convinced, and have we expressed our conviction in 
our works, that the library, as an educational instrument, is 
an absolute essential if the process of education begun in the 
child by means of the school is to be carried on and brought 
to full fruitage in the after-school life of the adult? I ask it 
seriously, are we? The question demands an answer, and I 
shall attempt to give it. 
An analysis of library conditions now prevailing in the South 
will reveal the following facts upon which the answer may be 
properly based. 
First, it will show that beginning with the year 1900, or 
thereabouts, a definite forward movement was made by one or 
two of the Southern States to provide for State-supported sys- 
tems of rural school libraries. An examination of the proceed- 
ings of this Association and of the Conference for Education 
in the South will show that from that date until the present, 
State after State has taken up the work and from year to 
year has so added to the number of volumes in libraries already 
established and has so increased the namber of new libraries 
that now scarcely a county in the whole South is without some 
sort of school library facilities. I refrain from figures with 
a long train of ciphers following in their wake, however im- 
posing they may be, but the number of such collections run 
high into the thousands and the number of volumes is well 
beyond the two million mark. 
Second, it will show that fully fifty per cent of the graded 
school systems of our towns and cities have library facilities 
18

    274 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
of varying kinds and that in many instances the work done by 
the library is very vital. 
It will show in the third place that through the personal 
efforts of schoolmen many well-equipped, serviceable public 
libraries have been established and library clubs and associa- 
tions has been organized for the purpose of making the public 
libraries of the South more efficient servants in the field of 
general education. 
These are facts of splendid achievement. If there were no 
others to be considered, I should withdraw the question. But 
a continuation of the analysis will show on the opposite side: 
First, that with very few exceptions no instruction in the 
administration of school libraries in the use of books and in 
supervision of children’s reading and literature, has been given 
by the Southern States in their teachers’ institutes, normal 
schools and State universities. Be it said to the very great 
credit of Winthrop College, of South Carolina, whose very pro- 
gressive head has led in many forward movements in Southern 
education, that for a number of years it has given two courses 
of such instruction with the view of equipping its graduates 
with such a store of information concerning school libraries 
as would enable them to administer them to the ultimate good 
of their pupils. In my own State, with its State university 
and four normal schools providing instruction for 3,000 pupils 
during the year, and with its 2,500 rural school libraries, not 
to mention town and city school libraries, only fourteen 
students were given instruction in a regular course in school 
library methods last year. It was our privilege to have this 
class at the State university, and to give several talks before 
students on the subject of the library, but this was the extent 
of normal training in this branch in North Carolina. From the 
reports I have had before me I have been forced to the con- 
clusion that a similar proportion prevails throughout the whole 
South between the number of school libraries and of teachers 
prepared by the normal schools to administer them. 
Secondly, it will show that of the Southern States holding 
teachers’ institutes, few, if any, offer in their courses of study 
any instruction in the subject mentioned or prepare bulletins 
for the guidance of the teachers in it. 
It will show in the third place that although the movement
-P-A-G-E-275
      JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 275    
                                         
                          
     
                                          for State-supported high schools has been begun since the one 
for rural libraries was inaugurated, adequate provision has not 
been made by which the special and larger needs of the high 
school’s library may be met. The high school library has been 
placed on the same basis as that of the rural school library, 
although it is clearly apparent that a more comprehensive 
library is essential to the best work of the high school and a 
larger income for library purposes is absolutely necessary. 
Fourth, it will show that although with the establishment of 
high schools high school inspectors have been appointed and 
sent here and there within the borders of the State to aid in - 
the standardization of courses and in the solution of local 
problems, no library inspectors have been appointed to do a 
similar work in the field for the libraries, although, on account 
of the fact that no instruction is given teachers in this all- 
important subject, by the normal schools and institutes, there 
is a correspondingly greater need for the services of such a field 
worker. 
It will show in the fifth place that the State teachers’ asso- 
ciations have yet to form library sections or to give place in 
their programs in a large way for the discussion of library 
problems. I note with genuine pleasure a tendency last year, 
and this on the part of teachers’ associations, to give librarians 
an opportunity to present library topics. This year at least 
in three States the Teachers’ Assemblies and Library Associa- 
tions are meeting in conjunction and exchanging speakers, but 
this is as yet by no means the general practice. 
Sixth, it will show that in securing legislation for the estab- 
lishment of library commissions and for the operation of sys- 
tems of traveling libraries, or, to put it differently, in the 
endeavor to extend library privileges to the whole people, the 
betterment associations, the women’s clubs, the literary and his- 
torical associations, and the library associations have been the 
principal aggressors. They have led the fight, and so far as 
victory has been won it has largely been won by them. 
Further analysis, however, is unnecessary. I think the point 
I am trying to make is by this time clearly patent. There is, 
in all seriousness, a timeliness and appropriateness in my ques- 
tion; for if we but admit the facts as they are, we are forced 
to acknowledge that in the matter of providing such library
-P-A-G-E-276
    
     
276 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
training as will best bring out the resources of our libraries we 
have been woefully negligent and in the work of general State- 
wide library extension we have been satisfied with too small a 
part. If we hark back to the ever-convincing test that trees are 
judged by their fruits, we are driven to the admission that in 
this all-important matter our actions have belied any profes- 
sions we have made to the contrary. We have not thought 
through the matter and have not given it the large, careful 
consideration it demands and of which it is eminently worthy. 
We have but made a beginning in the right direction. 
A thorough analysis also reveals the causes producing this 
condition. In an attempt to formulate a plan by which the 
condition may be remedied they must be taken into account. 
Briefly stated they are three: 
First, we have been so obsessed with theories and methods of 
how to teach, that we have lost sight of the alarming fact that 
80 per cent of us are out of school by the time we are 12 or 
14 years of age and that if we are not trained in that time 
as to the use of books and the value of reading as a means 
of enriching our experience and quickening our inner life, the 
mere how of reading will avail us but little. The object of our 
teaching has been too much to teach how to read rather than 
the reading habit, and to cram our minds with unrelated facts 
rather than to train us in the use of books from which in after 
years we can find for ourselves the chart for our daily sailing. 
Second, we have had, through keenest necessity, to provide 
the school house, increase the length of term, and train the 
teacher in what we have rightly or wrongly conceived to be 
the fundamentals. 
Third, too many of us have not known how to use books our- 
selves, and have experienced but little delight and inspiration 
in what we have read. Today many of us stand helpless before 
an encyclopedia which contains the information of which we 
are in need, and a card catalog overwhelms us. We have not 
known how to help ourselves, and failing in this we have not 
seen the necessity of training our children to help themselves. 
Again, far too many of us have never felt the fire of imagination 
kindled by nursery rhyme, fairy story and tale of heroic adven- 
ture. In my own experience I was twenty-five before I became 
acquainted with Alice in Wonderland or read a line of Aladdin
-P-A-G-E-277
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 277 
  and his wonderful lamp, and I expect to make my first genuine 
acquaintance with Andersen and Grimm and their troop of 
fairy folk during the next few years while my two little ones 
don their gowns in the evening twilight and climb and rest 
upon my knee before they are off for dreamland. Through 
them I hope to be led, even this late, if possible, into that won- 
derland which I failed to discover in my childhood in which 
fairy and prince and dream-children of Eugene Field and the 
little boy and snowy-haired Uncle Remus are forever at play. 
The very pathos of it, that so many of us have grown to 
maturity without having experienced the subtle influences of 
the book touching and moulding us in cur tender years! How 
can it be otherwise that we should be blind leaders of the blind, 
having thus failed to see the light? Or how can we be other 
than strong, rugged men, if such we are, possessed of undis- 
puted power, yet power not full and complete, because in our 
early years that which gave swiftness to fancy, alertness to 
thought, breadth to vision, depth to character, in so far as 
it is furnished through reading, was mostly lacking? 
But to dwell too long upon the analysis of the conditions 
or the causes giving rise to them is beside the point. The real 
matter is. yet before us, and I pass immediately to a very brief 
consideration of the subject of my paper which, according to the 
official program, is a Constructive Library Platform for South- 
ern Schools, or, a course of procedure by which the library 
conditions generally prevailing in the South may be improved 
by the efforts of the schools. 
If it were my high privilege to assist in writing a platform 
for Southern schoolmen or in mapping out a plan by the opera- 
tion of which the library would be made a more efficient agent 
in the work of public education, a privilege of which I think 
it is the duty of the Southern Educational Association to avail 
itself, I should have it look to the accomplishment of the fol- 
lowing ends: 
ADDITIONAL SCHOOL LIBRARIES. 
First, continuing the practice already so splendidly begun of 
placing libraries in the rural schools, every public school in 
the South should be equipped with the best school library pos- 
sible. The few years constituting the school period are too 
brief in themselves, and the training too limited, to chart the
-P-A-G-E-278
  278 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
  pupil’s whole course. He needs to learn how and where to find 
his bearings after the sheltering haven of the school has been 
left and he is driving before the winds on the high sea. In 
the case of the primary schools a serious fault which injures 
the efficiency of the present system and which needs considera- 
tion, is that of close supervision. Neither the State superin- 
tendent nor the county superintendent watches after the use 
of the library as carefully as could be desired. Of course, the 
difficulties involved are great and the failure is pardonable, 
but if it can be avoided it should be. To do this effectively 
it may be necessary to follow the plan recently adopted by 
California as a whole, and by sections of other States— 
namely, of employing a county superintendent of school 
libraries. Another weakness of the system is that adequate 
provision is not made by which the individual collections can 
be freshened up from time to time. It is true that books 
are added occasionally, but some plan should be devised by 
which an exchange of collections could be made if desirable 
between neighboring schools. In this way each school would 
retain its reference books, but if its main collection was not 
a duplicate of that of the neighboring school, an exchange 
could be effected by means of which renewed interest could 
be created and each school would be benefited. Instruc- 
tion in the use of books should be given, and such selec- 
tions should be read and assigned for commitment to memory 
as would insure the formation of habits of reading and stand- 
ards of taste. 
In the high schools a larger list of reference works should 
be provided and the collection should be so amplified that in 
the special class rooms and the general library material could 
always be found at hand which would stimulate interest in 
the prescribed work and would further develop the habit of 
reading and fix standards of taste. In other sections of the 
country where the library has been used to great profit in the 
schools, the presence of from twenty-five to fifty volumes in 
each class room, known as class room libraries, insures in 
connection with the general library of the school, the most 
effective method of providing library material for every pupil. 
In order that the range of choice might be larger than it is at 
present the superintendents of public instruction, in connec-
-P-A-G-E-279
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 279 
tion with library commissions or individual library workers, 
should compile adequate lists from which every need of the 
high school library could be met. Among the many excellent 
lists of this kind which would be unusually suggestive and 
helpful are to be mentioned the one prepared for the second- 
ary schools of Oregon, copies of which may be had from the 
Library Commission of that State, and the list prepared for 
the National Education Association and published at a cost 
of ten cents the copy, in its report on the Relation of Public 
Libraries to Public Schools in 1899. These two lists, revised 
and adopted to meet the needs of special localities, are in 
every sense admirable and I commend them most heartily to 
you. 
NORMAL SCHOOL INSTRUCTION IN LIBRARY METHODS. 
Second, after the libraries have been secured and proper 
methods of administration of the system have been devised, 
provision should be made for the training of teachers in the 
use of books and children’s literature. It is not sufficient 
to set the book case beside the teacher’s desk or place it in a 
corner, and let it stand there. It must be properly used. It 
is the clear duty of the departments of pedagogy of the various 
State universities, of the normal schools, and of the conductors 
of summer schools and teachers’ institutes, to give this in- 
struction. If we wish guidance in this matter, there are a 
dozen splendid manuals which can be had at a nominal price, 
and the extensive report of the National Education Associa- 
tion, submitted, adopted and printed in 1906, are at hand. 
SCHOOL LIBRARY INSPECTORS. 
Third, in continuation of this instruction the State should 
provide a school library director or inspector who should not 
merely have charge of the distribution of the State appro- 
priations for school libraries, but should visit, as the high 
school inspectors do, the various school libraries in the State 
and give them the benefit of personal advice and suggestion in 
addition to that given from time to time by the central office 
through bulletins and special letters. This person should be 
a trained librarian as well as teacher, and his work should 
be the standardization of school library methods. The sugges- 
tion I am making is not an experiment. It has been carried
-P-A-G-E-280
280 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
out in practice in a number of large city school systems and 
in several States, and has yielded splendid results. 
The recent experience of a congregation of which I know 
will possibly give point to what I have been urging. At con- 
siderable expense and very great sacrifice, it purchased and 
installed a splendid pipe organ. The Sunday following the 
installation the membership gathered, full of pleasurable an- 
ticipations. The deep bass pipes, the tremulous flute notes, 
the subtle overtones and the splendid harmonies—the thought 
of all of these and the comfort and spiritual rapture they 
could impart possessed every mind. But when the moment 
came for the instrument to win joyous, reverent tribute from 
every heart, the minister arose and announced that as yet 
its stops were not fully understood by the organist. In the 
meanwhile it would be necessary to use the old reed organ. 
And so the new instrument, capable of filling every heart with 
a glow of spiritual fervor, stood silent in its splendid beauty, 
while the congregation sat cramped in purse and starved in 
soul. In what whit is the case of the community different 
which has taxed itself to procure a school library without at 
the same time having secured a teacher so trained in the sub- 
tleness and power of books as will enable him to make its 
splendid resources touch the boy and girl and flood his or 
her life with the cheering warmth of song and story? 
INSTRUCTION OF PUPILS IN THE USE OF BOOKS. 
  Fourth, instruction should not only be given teachers 
through normal instruction and library methods standardized 
through inspectors, but definite instruction should be given 
every pupil in the use of books. Special periods in the course 
of study should be devoted to this work. The pupil should be 
taught the purpose of the preface of a book, how to distin- 
guish between the table of contents and the index, how to use 
the index, even if it is to a set containing two or more volumes ; 
how to consult dictionaries, encyclopedias, atlases, maps, etc., 
and how to use a card catalogue. If need be, he should be 
taught to classify and catalog a small collection. In this day 
of modern business methods, when one cannot carry in his 
memory all the facts essential to the conduct of the business 
in which he is engaged, it is absolutely necessary that he em-
-P-A-G-E-281
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 281 
ploy scientific time and labor saving devices. Among these, 
along with the adding machines and cash register, is the alpha- 
betic card or printed index. The mastery of this index prin- 
ciple, whether the pupil is to be a librarian, a banker, a law- 
yer, a physician, a politician, a traveling salesman, a mer- 
chant, or what not, is one of the greatest assets he can acquire 
because it enables him to aid himself. If he goes to college, 
it opens the college library’s resources to him. If he becomes 
a banker, he will find the principle employed in the handling 
of notes and loans. If he becomes a lawyer, he will use it 
in citing cases with which to support his brief. If he tends 
the man who is parching with fever, it will enable him to con- 
sult his medical library for the further study of the disease 
from which his patient is suffering. Even if we leave out 
of consideration the moral and cultural value of the reading 
which such training will lead to, the training in itself is 
invaluable; for through it the boy becomes a self-educated man 
and is capable of continuing his education in his after-school 
career. In our manual training classes the boy is taught the 
use of tools; in our agricultural classes he is taught farm 
methods and the use of implements; in our business courses 
he is taught the administration of the store and the keeping 
of its accounts. It yet remains for us in our libraries to 
teach the use of books which will make of permanent value, 
through study after school, all that he has been taught in 
the other branches. In whatever work he engages, he will 
find this part of his training of service, and long after his 
geometry and Latin are forgotten, he will find himself still 
in possession of a key which will unlock the store of informa- 
tion bearing upon the infinite problems of his daily life. 
     
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LIBRARY COMMISSIONS. 
Fifth, every schoolman should busy himself in securing 
legislation in his State providing for the establishment, equip- 
ment and adequate financial maintenance of a free library 
commission, which, composed of educators and _ librarians 
alike, should act independently of the superintendent of pub- 
lic instruction’s office, but should maintain to all libraries in 
its State an advisory, helpful relation. It is the duty of the 
schools to aid in securing this legislation, although they are
-P-A-G-E-282
    282 SOUTHERN BDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
not the only ones who may be benefited by it. The experience 
of thirty or more States of the Union points unmistakably to 
the conclusion that library work for the whole people yields the 
largest returns when such a special board of library commis- 
sioners and library organizers maintain a public office and offer 
their services to any community, school, or club for the improve- 
ment of its library facilities. These should be the active agencies 
for the formation of library sentiment and by them every library 
problem should be considered and in so far as possible solved. 
They should maintain public offices at the State capitals and 
be in readiness to serve anyone in the State at all times. In 
Maryland, North Carolina, Kentucky, Missouri and Georgia, 
such commissions exist as separate State departments, but only 
in Kentucky and Missouri is the appropriation made by the 
State in any sense adequate. In North Carolina, Missouri and 
Kentucky trained librarians have been employed as field secre- 
taries and are rendering an enlarging, useful service. In Vir- 
ginia, Tennessee, Alabama and Texas library extension is pro- 
vided for by the State through the State library or the depart- 
ment of archives and history. This arrangement, however, even 
appropriations are equal, is not as satisfactory as that in which 
the commissions are separate; for the work of library extension 
is apt to be subordinated to that of the department with which 
it is connected. It suffers, too, from the lack of standing out 
singly and distinctively as an office having special work to be 
performed and of an importance second to nothing. 
TRAVELING LIBRARIES. 
Sixth, to do their work properly it is a matter of wide ex- 
perience that these commissions must not only publish bulletins 
for the dissemination of knowledge concerning library matters, 
send out library organizers, encourage communities to estab- 
lish new libraries and to improve old ones, etc., but they must 
be enabled to aid schools, rural communities, villages and towns 
by sending out a well-organized collection of traveling libraries. 
Up to the present Virginia, Missouri and Tennessee have been 
the only States in the South to operate an extensive system of 
this kind, but during the present year over six hundred cases 
of fifty volumes each are in circulation and are rendering a 
splendid service. By means of such a system any rural primary
-P-A-G-E-283
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 283 
school may have its library shelves replenished by a loan; the 
debating and reference sections of the high school library can 
be supplemented for a given period ; a village community can be 
supplied with a collection of books on agriculture, public health, 
domestic science, etc., in addition to a representative list of 
fiction, travel, history, biography and other forms of literature ; 
a town which has never had a public library can receive a case 
and make it the nucleus of a free, public library. Books can be 
brought to all the people, and the library idea can be crystalized 
into a general forward library movement. Here, certainly, is 
a splendid field for coéperation on the part of the schoolmen 
with the librarians, and every effort possible should be made to 
bring about the proper establishment of these offices. 
ENLARGEMENT OF SERVICE OF STATE LIBRARIES. 
Seventh, the State library, whenever it is expedient, should 
be made to contribute to the library needs of the State. In the 
South State libraries have until recently been little other than 
documentary collections and have served few others than the 
State officers and members of the legislatures, Under the newer 
order of things, when every genuinely progressive library is 
extending its usefulness in as many directions as possible, it 
should not be so restricted either in the character of its contents 
or in the extent of its service. In the South especially, where 
large city public libraries are few and where distances to other 
large libraries of other sections are great, it becomes more and 
more imperative that the State library should build up a strong 
reference collection and extend its privileges to any individual 
or library in the State. Among the Southern States which have 
adopted this plan Virginia has met with most signal success. 
On the other hand, in my own State, where the service of the 
State library is restricted, it is possible for the university library 
to borrow books easily through inter-library loans from every 
library in the State except the State library. The Virginia plan 
is certainly the better of the two and its general acceptance is 
exteremely desirable. Here again, the schoolmen can help the 
librarians in securing the desired legislation. 
MORE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. 
. Eighth, the services of the free public library must be secured 
for all of our towns and cities and must be more systematically

utilized by our pupils and teachers. Unfortunately for the 
South, development in this field has been slow. The library’s 
place and usefulness must be more fully understood. Its work 
with children, its coéperation with the schools, its helpfulness 
to study clubs, its contributions of books and periodicals and 
sets of stereopticon views to surrounding rural communities, its 
public lectures, its activities in a thousand helpful directions— 
all this is too far-reaching in its influence for good and in its 
educational import for the South to miss. It must be secured 
at whatever cost. If there are no constructive library laws upon 
our statute books which will stimulate the establishment of such 
libraries (and in several States there are not) they must be 
writen and enacted. Public sentiment in favor of libraries must 
be cultivated. Vigorous local tax campaigns for the mainte- 
nance of libraries, as well as of schools, must be waged and 
won. The library must be directed intelligently and made to 
serve. This is our work as educators. If we perform our duties 
well, our labor shall not be in vain and our reward will be great. 
The analysis of library conditions existing in the South today 
has been made and a plan or platform by the adoption of which 
it can be changed, and changed for the better, is before you. 
I realize fully that it is one man’s analysis and one man’s plan, 
but until a more comprehensive and more thoroughly thought 
out policy is laid before you I present it to you and in the name 
of the children of the Southland, whose duty and high privilege 
it is yours to prepare for participation in a large, well-rounded 
life, I call upon you to adopt it and see to it that the good 
which it contemplates for your children and your children’s 
children is happily realized.

THE AMERICAN SCHOOL PEACE LEAGUE. 
L. A. MEAD, BOSTON, MASS. 
Just a modern industry and commerce are making new and 
costly demands upon our school equipments, so modern politics, 
investments and higher standards of ethics are demanding 
teachers with broader views, larger sympathies and a keener 
sense of justice. The new technical and commercial courses 
require machinery, laboratories, time and money. The new 
teaching of patriotism and internationalism requires no machin- 
ery, money and very little extra time. It requires chiefly a 
teacher who understands this new century’s problems and pos- 
sibilities, and who counts nothing human foreign to him. 
The American School Peace League, endorsed by the National 
Education Association and by the large majority of the super- 
intendents of the country, is today the most efficient instrument 
yet created to introduce into our schools that twentieth century 
point of view in the teaching of patriotism, history, literature 
and economics, which is demanded by modern conditions of 
commerce and by a higher standard of ethics. : 
Modern business has discovered a new fact. It is that, not 
only is Franklin’s maxim true that “The worst thing you can 
do to a customer is to knock him on the head,” but the next 
worst thing you can do is to leave him a pauper. If we want 
to sell goods, we must have prosperous customers. The business 
man of the past assumed that his own prosperity implied an- 
other’s loss, and that, like children playing see-saw, when one 
was up the other must be down. The modern economics which 
should be taught in every grammar school is, that in trade both 
parties must prosper or trade will cease; that the time has 
passed when any nation can go to war with its neighbor and 
gain as much as it loses, even if it is victor; that banking and 
commercial interests and investments have revolutionized the 
conditions that obtained a half century ago, and brought about 
a complexity of relationships and interdependence which make 
the war system today even more insane than it is wicked. Mod- 
ern business, quite as much as Christian ethics, demands the 
teaching in our schools ef the new twentieth century spirit of 
internationalism. his goes hand in hand with that patriotism
-P-A-G-E-286
  286 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
which makes all men and women i1«ilize it to be a religious duty 
to serve their country as they do their God, every week and 
every year, as long as life shall last. Just as love of home does 
not diminish love of country, so the new internationalism does 
not diminish that just pride in country which every child must 
be taught. But it is perhaps not too much to say that, until 
recently, no subject has been soo poorly taught in our schools as 
patriotism. Some years ago a teacher in Washington asked 
a pupil to define the word, and he replied, “Patriotism means 
killing Spaniards.” The conception of the soldier as the patriot 
par excellence has been all but universal. President Eliot’s 
statement that the function of the policeman is far higher than 
that of the soldier needs special emphasis. Pride of country 
has too often been substituted for service of country among the 
large class who boast of revolutionary ancestry, and who would 
rather listen to papers on colonial furniture or eighteenth cen- 
tury tomb stones than to help the immigrant Slay or Italian 
to know our laws and history, and to worthily share in the up- 
building of this nation. We have disabused our minds of the 
notion that steeples and stained-glass windows make us 
religious, but we still cling to the notion that saluting the flag 
and rising when we sing the “Star Spangled Banner” indicates 
that we are patriots. 
The teacher who is imbued with the spirit of the new teach- 
ing has the task of translating this beautiful, sacred word, pa- 
triotism, into concrete deeds of daily good citizenship. He must 
teach girls that they are not only to be mothers of defenders 
of their country, but defenders themselves; that the only enemies 
that threaten us, or ever will threaten us, are those which are 
not to be fought with guns or bombs; that the great army of 
school teachers which is keeping our country from being ruined 
by an illiterate mob is a far greater defense than all the iron- 
clads which paraded down the Hudson to the plaudits of the 
uninformed populace. He must teach that in all this republic’s 
- history we have lost less than 15,000 men by foreign bullets, 
which is only one-tenth the number slain every year by tubercu- 
losis, and one-half the number killed every decade in our mines. 
He must show how disease, poverty, ignorance, intemperance, 
vice and crime are undermining our national life, and that we 
are blindly concentrating our defense where it is least needed,
-P-A-G-E-287
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 287 
and leaving ourselves undefended from real danger. The pupil 
needs to know that we burn up every year seven times as much 
property as does all Europe, and that we are the most homicidal 
of all great nations, far more than he needs to know the products 
of Siam or the campaigns of 1812. The new teaching of patriot- 
ism will be concrete and intensive; it will minimize prejudice 
and emphasize personal service. It will point out that heroes 
and deserters and traitors in civic life are as many as in time 
of war. It will count Colonel Waring’s cleaning up of New 
York streets and lowering the death rate by 15,000 as a greater 
patriotic service than that performed by any man in our war 
with Mexico, which General Grant, who fought in it, denounced 
as iniquitous. 
The teacher of history, who has the view point of the Ameri- 
can School Peace League, will pay far less attention to the 
details of wars, and far more to their causes and results. He 
will show that our Revolutionary War was fought between the 
progressive party and the retrogressive party on both sides the 
Atlantic, and that the week of war flurry in 1896 over the 
Venezuelan boundary line, which cost us $100,000,000 in foreign 
investments, was largely due to the fact that for three genera- 
tions we had been taught to hate redcoats. We did not know 
that all English history text-books teach English children to 
honor Washington and condemn the policy of George III. The 
teacher of history will show that we began every foreign war 
we ever had, and that for 100 years at least we have had no 
attack; that when in 1817 we, in time of peace, prepared for 
peace with England, we achieved it and have kept it for 100 
years. He will teach also the marvelous history in the making, 
as thrilling as Marathon, or Dunbar, or Bunker Hill; the teacher 
who has the dramatic instinct can make the story of the Hague 
Conferences, the Doggerbank inquiry and the Portsmouth treaty 
as exciting as any event in history when he shows the far-reach- 
ing significance of this beginning of world organization. But 
“above all nations is humanity,” and this fundamental doctrine 
must be taught in every primary school that men are not first 
of all, Russians, or Frenchmen, or Englishmen, or Americans, 
but they are first of all human beings, citizens of the world, 
children of God. More and more the common interests of men, 
not mere propinquity, are drawing them together. The physi-
-P-A-G-E-288

    cians of Italy and Germany and Argentina have more in com- 
mon than the rich and poor, the great employer and peasant, in 
each of their own countries. Workingmen’s and employers’ 
organizations are stretching beyond their territorial boundaries. 
There is to be a new alignment in the future, when international 
investments are so rapidly forcing men to care as much for 
the prosperity of lands where their money is invested as for the 
land where they live. 
The School Peace League had its origin in the great meeting 
of 1907 in Carnegie Hall, New York, when, in connection with 
the first National Peace Congress, 4,000 pupils, chosen as dele- 
gates from their respective schools, attended a great peace meet- 
ing presided over by Superintendent Maxwell. So brilliant was 
the success of this gathering that a committee was appointed 
to promote organized effort for peace instruction in the schools, 
which has resulted in the formation of a league of educators, 
who work to accomplish results through printed matter, prize 
essays, and through addresses to normal schools and teachers’ 
conventions. The subject is new, and as yet few teachers are 
prepared to present it adequately. The league has today twenty- 
seven State branches, besides eight other branches, and expects 
this coming year to establish them in most of the remaining 
States. No fee is asked of teachers, and the movement is sus- 
tained by the voluntary contributions of several individuals and 
the World’s Peace Foundation. Its resources are still inade- 
quate, but when they are enlarged directors will be employed 
to conduct several different departments, such as press, publica- 
tions, history text books, etc. 
Last year the British School Peace League was established, 
and probably in a few years most of the European and South 
American countries will have similar organizations. The Inter- 
national Council, composed of two representatives of each na- 
tion, which is in process of formation, includes Count Apponyi, 
the distinguished Hungarian statesman; M. Ferdinand Buisson, 
formerly Minister of Education in France; Prof. Ostwald, the 
famous chemist of Germany ; Sir Michael Sadler and Sir James 
Yoxall, of England, are others who have consented to serve. 
When thoroughly equipped, this council will employ six direc- 
tors, who will have organized departments of the work similar 
to those in America, and will include one on interchange of
-P-A-G-E-289
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 289 
teachers and pupils and one on standardization of history text 
books. 
The league offers yearly to seniors in high and normal schools 
in Europe as in America, two sets of three prizes each. These 
are for $75, and $50, and $25, and are for the best essays respect- 
fully on “The Significance of the Two Hague Peace Confer- 
ences,” and “The Opportunity and Duty of the Schools in the 
International Peace Movement.” 
The league has been organized with extraordinary care and 
efficiency by its able Secretary, Mrs. Andrews, and the list of 
its officers and councilors in clude the names of the leading 
educators of the country. ‘The superintendents have unani- 
mously voted at their annual meeting to recommend the celebra- 
tion of May 18, the anniversary of the first Hague Conference, 
by holding special exercises in the schools, in which a lesson 
on the new international history shall be taught, and the pro- 
gram of world organization be made clear. The child will be 
taught how that method which brought peace with justice be- 
tween thirteen quarreling colonies, and then between forty-six 
States, is to achieve peace with justice between forty-six nations. 
The directors of the league have in preparation an outline of 
study on Good Will, which is to cover every month of the year 
from the lowest primary to the highest grammar grade. Be- 
ginning with the first duties in the home and toward playmates 
and animals, it proceeds later to show how good will manifests 
itself in civic patriotism, then in national patriotism, and 
finally, in the larger internationalism and in the plan for an 
organization and the most hopeful instrument today in the edu- 
revision by experts, pamphlets will be prepared for use in each 
grade, which will give all the material necessary for these brief 
lessons in ethics to be used in the year. Stories and questions 
which shall elicit original observation and thought will be the 
chief method of instruction. The business world has come to 
see that good business and national honor require that our 
schools teach what, alas, the homes neglect to teach. 
Recent revelations of wholesale bribery in rural sections, of 
savage cruelty and lawlessness in Christian communities, of 
colossal graft in civic offices, are compelling the consideration of 
something more fundamental in our curriculums than book- 
keeping, drawing and sloyd. The study of Good Will in all its 
19
-P-A-G-E-290

  ramifications is more needed today than any technical instruc- 
tion. The children who are going into business must be pre- 
pared to resist that temptation peculiar to our get-rich-quick 
age of trying to get something for nothing. The future voter 
must develop imagination and sympathy and power to put him- 
self in the other fellow’s place. He must learn that there is no 
double code of ethics, one for the gentleman and another for 
the nation. 
The American School Peace League is, I believe, the best 
organization and the most hopeful instrument today in the edu- 
cational world to promote the moral advancement of the rising 
generation, and to lay the basis of industrial and international 
peace by the careful study of that upon which all peace must 
rest, namely, justice. The study of justice, the removal of 
prejudice, the enlargement of sympathy through a deeper com- 
prehension, demand no more time from the already overbur- 
dened school curriculum. But they demand from the teacher a 
new method of teaching all subjects which deal with human life. 
One may continue the nineteenth century methods of teaching 
mathematics, grammar, spelling and carpentry, but, I repeat, 
one cannot properly teach geography, history, economics, or 
patriotism in this twentieth century without that new and 
broader point of view for which the School Peace League stands. 
The Cosmopolitan Clubs, numbering 2,000 members in thirty 
colleges, are continuing the spirit of the School Peace League 
in the higher institutions. The league is heartily in sympathy 
with the noble efforts of President Taft to arbitrate every jus- 
ticiable question arising between our own and other nations. 
Every teacher should be a missionary in his own State to arouse 
the voters of his State to write personal letters to his Senators 
to ratify the pending arbitration treaties. The importance of 
their ratification to the future world leadership of our country 
cannot be overestimated. With these two treaties secured, 
others would soon follow, and no longer would our Government 
be willing to squander, as it is doing, seventy cents out of every 
dollar in our National treasury in paying for past war and in 
preparation for future war. If there is anyone who should wish 
to divert these colossal sums to constructive purposes, it is not 
the Southern teacher, who needs ten times the present funds to 
fight the enemy of ignorance? (Applause.)

Tur Coair: The great aim of education is character. With- 
out character all education is as sounding brass and tinkling 
cymbals. Heretofore we have emphasized physical education 
and mental education. Spiritual education has been a side issue, 
incidental to the other kinds of education. The time has come 
when it is desired to have a well-rounded education—physical, 
mental and spiritual. The speaker whom I now have the pleas- 
ure to introduce brings us a most important message, which 
should find lodgment in every mind here, and all who hear him 
should go forth with the determination to work for the educa- 
tion of the well-rounded man—the spiritual, the mental and the 
physical man. I take great pleasure in introducing to you Dr.

EDUCATION ADEQUATE TO THE FUTURE OF THE 
SOUTH. 
H. F. COPE, CHICAGO, ILL. 
No man can predict the future, but everyone may observe the 
signs of the times. We may not prophesy, but we must prepare. 
There are three outstanding and prophetic features of the pres- 
ent era which indicate the future of the South. These features 
point impressively to the tasks which the educational agencies 
cannot but face. We all clearly recognize that the schools have 
no other purpose than that of preparing citizens to live fully 
the life and meet the duties and problems of their age. But 
the true school is a prophetic institution; it employs the life 
that has been on the life that is to fit for the life that is to be. 
The schools of the South will prepare for: First, an age of 
great commercial and industrial development; second, a period 
of close and more complex social organization; and third a 
period of struggle over the great social questions. This is no 
dull, tame age in which we live. The battles are not all in 
history; the opportunities for heroism are not all past. But 
the battles of tomorrow will be fought not with carnal 
weapons, but with spiritual. They are not likely to lead to 
bloody fields, but they will call no less for the laying down 
of life. The scholar and the teacher are the captains of this 
new age of heroism. Because the battle is with ideas, prin-
-P-A-G-E-292
292 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
ciples, motives and thought, the schools are the great chances 
for heroic service. 
There are few so foolish as to suppose that the promise of a 
period of great commercial prosperity means a future of un- 
hindered felicity, means a facile entrance into a land flowing 
with milk and honey. With the developments come the diffi- 
culties. Doubtless many will look back to the period when, as 
Riley says, “We used to be so happy and so poor.” But only 
the cowardly will seek to dodge the duties that the development 
of our civilization brings upon us. The hardest of all work is 
pioneer work, and the hardest of all pioneer work is that which 
lies in the intellectual and spiritual realm. This is the teacher’s 
task. The schools are the moral and intellectual pioneers of 
the nation. They blaze the new trails and cut out the clearings. 
They do not simply teach that which all men know, but that 
which men need to know for the coming day. 
I. LOOKING FORWARD TO INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT. 
  The South faces a new era. No one doubts but that she will 
come to its zenith with splendid commercial prosperity. The 
era will be that of great mills, splendid transportation facilities, 
large fortunes, and material advance, of which we as yet cannot 
even dream. But if we could spend the hours describing the 
wonders, cataloging the marvels, estimating the wealth that 
awaits the South, would the tale be all told? No; for the South 
means something more than mills and merchandise and money ; 
the South means men and women. The South means traditions, 
ideals and character. When you have cataloged all that she has, 
you have not touched what she is. You can no more know the 
South by her coming prosperity than you could tell her worth 
by her past industrial poverty. We must always keep clear 
the distinction between what we have and what we are. The 
purpose of education, in part, is to make what we have serve 
what we may be. The big question for the South is not, after 
all, what will coming ages tell of mills and noisy industries, but 
what shall she produce of manhood and womanhood, through 
the toil and strain, through all the curriculum of the mills and 
merchandise? What shall be the gift of the South to the com- 
ing America? There is something finer, something needed far 
more than great industrial prosperity, and no education is
-P-A-G-E-293
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 293 
adéquate that does not keep that in mind. We ought to train 
all-our boys and girls to efficiency in making a living, but remem- 
bering that this is only a part of the greater process of making 
lives. That vocational education which’ makes the youth only 
the nimble tool of either a taskmaster or of his own ambition 
to maké wages, loses sight of man’s’ true vocation, his calling 
to manhood. That education which has eyes only for machinery 
and money, and’ forgets man, particularly the youth as a moral 
factor, forgets to think of the kind of man it is making, ends 
only in disaster. Our modern danger is that we shall educate 
ourselves into a racé of slaves, slaves to the necessities of com- 
mercialism, bent beneath the load of our success, and shivering 
at the whip of our own sensuous desires. We do not need to 
court poverty nor to fight against prosperity; we do not need 
to decry material success; but we do need to put all the lesser 
ends as séervants of the greater ones, to make our commercial 
success serve the end of personal development. The oné product 
by which we may measure the value of all our progress is the 
personal one the kind of people we make in that process. 
The increasing complexity of business life calls for closer 
social organization. Many of us can remember the days when 
life in at least many sections of this country seemed’ to be a 
pleasant, lazy, hap-hazard business. A man might go to his 
office, or to fishing, hunting or pleasuring of any sort, as he 
chose. Some people call those the shiftless days, and some think 
of them as the days when folks really lived, enjoyed life and 
found themselves. At any rate those days have gone; we are 
caught up’ into the rush and press of modern economic condi- 
tions. We find the easy-going ways past, and intricate organi- 
zation stamping all our life today. When life was a matter of 
sauntering along at your own gait, working or resting, fishing 
or gossiping, as you chose, it seemed as though there could be 
no doubt but that men were making manhood through it all; 
that was the only thing they were making. Now, under our 
present-day conditions, what are we making? A few people are 
making money; many are passing more money than before 
through their hands—they are making a partial living. But out 
of all the energy, whirring of wheels and grinding of men and 
things, what is the ultimate product? Are we growing a better 
race of people? Are we producing higher, finer, stronger, nobler 
character?
-P-A-G-E-294
  
  294 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
_ The South has the opportunity to determine whether her 
people shall be masters or slaves of industrialism and commer- 
cial mechanism. You can face your problem before it is fully 
on you. The menace which threatens communities which have 
been longer under complex commercial conditions is, that they 
have had no opportunity to face the problem; their people have 
been conquered before a campaign could be planned. 
Without doubt the prime factor in an educational program 
adequate to an age of industrial development will be its em- 
phasis on personal character. We must save the person from the 
materializing potencies of our age and, for the permanency of 
industrial and commercial success, we must give to our age 
morally developed and highly motived social servants. 
Another demand of such an age is that in education we lay 
sound foundations of physical health and development for these 
factors in social efficiency. The strain of living, the very needs 
of society, demand strong and developed bodies. We can only 
secure these by attention to physical training and by insuring 
that the student is under the direction of the school a sufficient 
number of years for his development. If the people make the 
schools responsible for training youth to social efficiency, the 
people must furnish equipment for physical training and must 
give us the youth during all the growing years. This means 
playgrounds and directed play. 
The school period of life must he lengthened or the South will 
be attempting a giant’s task with but dwarfed lives. The longer 
the compulsory school period, the larger the race we can raise. 
Health is to a people like breath to a person. There is neither 
spiritual nor material progress in advance of the physical. The 
schools must teach the life of sane hygiene. We cannot afford 
the handicaps of dirt, disease and indifference to physical well- 
being. To raise a race of fit people we have to lay foundations 
in blood and muscle, and teach them how to cause physical con- 
ditions favorable to health to prevail. 
. Next, ample attention must be paid to moral training. In 
the elementary schools this will be the chief aim, secured through 
organization and discipline and in all the curriculum; in the 
advanced schools it will be a matter of direct instruction. The 
product of the morally disciplined and matured person will be 
the test of the schools. Vocational training offers peculiar 
opportunities to train to an ethical relation to life.
-P-A-G-E-295
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 295 
  iI. FACING INCREASINGLY CLOSE AND COMPLEX SOCIAL RELATIONS. 
We will, first, recognize the school as society; as the place 
where, by living together, children learn the art of social living. 
We can hardly emphasize the importance of this view of the 
school. It is our great American melting pot, where lives are 
fused under ideal an altruistic motives. It does not melt us 
into uniformity, but into harmony. It should teach by its very 
organization and conduct, duty, consideration of others, cour- 
tesy, honor, loyalty, and the glory of service. The problems 
growing out of new social relations are solved only as we 
habituate ourselves to take all life in terms of the efficient ser- 
vice that leads to the larger self, in terms of culture for the 
sake of service. 
We will recognize education as directed evolution. The in- 
creasing complicity of life is only the mark of higher stages of 
being. The school leads ever from the simplest relations into 
the more complex. It is not so much to teach us the facts of 
this mundane organism, as to train us to organize ourselves 
and all ourselves into one social whole. We can devise no cur- 
riculum embracing the social situations and problems of to- 
morrow; they are unknown to us. But we can determine that 
the schools shall grow lives, shall aid and stimulate every one 
to reach the fullness of social development. Nor dare we allow 
the careless criticism of the ignorant, nor the demands of the 
shortsighted, mechanical mind, to turn us from the purpose of 
bringing the riches and stimuli of the ages to the work of 
developing people competent to live in this age. We do not 
train hands, we do not teach minds; we do cause lives to grow, 
and know their work and their world. The best contribution 
that the school can make to the society of tomorrow is a 
developed person, who is strong enough in motive and so dis- 
ciplined in will and habit that ie can meet the situation which 
we cannot yet see. 
Facing increasing complex social problems, we cannot avoid 
the peculiar racial problem of the South. I approach it with 
hesitation, because you must know it so much better than I 
can. I treat only in response to the explicit mandate of your 
program committee, and do so only in terms of education, i. e., 
in terms of the directed evolution of personality. Nor is this 
a study any further than their moral development. This is

  a problem dealing with a people who are in a, to us, remote 
stage of evolution. To ignore this fact is to kick out the facts 
and: try to stand on sentiment. The negro race has not yet 
reached the stage of the white race. To attempt to use’ precisely 
the same methods for both is surely a disastrous. blindness to 
the laws of evolution. The ultimate purpose of all personal 
evolution is the same, but the process must vary with the stage 
of development. To admit this is simply to apply to a race 
what we have been so strenuously contending must be applied 
in school to the individual. The fact that the negro is not 
racially the white man’s equal does not mean that he has fewer 
rights; it does mean they are different. It may mean he has 
more rights—the right to our fostering oversight, patience, lead- 
ing, discipline and affectionate development. History has made 
an advanced people the responsible educators of a people less 
advanced. 
What does this mean for the school policy of the South? A 
clear understanding, based on the motive of an accepted racial 
responsibility of the type of educational stimuli needed by this 
negro race in its present stage of evolution. The first thing 
needed is a scientifie study of the genetic basis of negro educa- 
tion. This has not yet been attempted in any broad and 
thorough manner. The peculiar task of the South is to work 
out a special educational program for the negro stage of develop- 
ment, basing it upon racial psychology. We must have the 
courage to follow the facts of racial and social evolution, and 
to be loyal to the same principles of genetic psychology which 
have so greatly modified the educational program in the schools 
for our own race. The attempt to solve the negro problem by 
a lazy transfer of the curricula and schools for the white is 
only to dodge a great duty, to fight the facts of science and to 
miss the high destiny of a splendid service. No further steps 
ought to be taken until a thoroughgoing study of his peculiar 
race needs has been inaugurated. Such a study will doubtless 
result in the establishment of schools or educational agencies of 
an entirely new type for this race. 
I believe that if we accept the educational responsibility for 
the negro race, we will find that he will grow best among his 
own kind in the environment, particularly the personal environ- 
ment which is normal to him. No stimulus can be as great as
-P-A-G-E-297
  JOURNAL OF PROOEHEDINGS. 297 
that of teachers and social groups of his own race. This is 
simply to recognize 'that all life grows best in its normal environ- 
ment. 
Next, develop leaders of his own kind, preachers, doctors, 
teachers, who will be the pioneers of their people. They must 
be moral leaders. The moral education of the negro can come 
only through such leaders, teachers and preachers, who will 
interpret the life about them’ on’ moral terms, who will show 
these people how to find right social rélations and right adjust- 
ment to their whole environment. They need moral heroes. 
There is especial need of training such leaders to take religion 
in terms of moral duty. 
If we would lead into the moral stages of racial development, 
the negro schools must first teach the great lesson which the 
Anglo-Saxon had to learn long ago, that living means useful- 
ness. The white man’s intellectual development was preceeded 
by apprenticeship to the tasks of the world. He entered this 
stage by the avenue of toil; he is not ashamed of the way, nor 
does he believe that any man can really and fully live without 
labor. The schools for the negro must teach and train him to 
take his life in terms of usefulness. This does not mean that he 
shall be a beast of burden, but it does mean that he shall most 
certainly learn the lesson which has been and must continue to 
be our social salvation, that we owe it to life to give the world 
our efficient service. We ought to try to lead the negro from 
the shiftless, happy-go-lucky, banana-drop-in-the-sleeping-mouth 
stage, to the entrance of that higher way, where men read life 
as their chance to serve. Such training in trades, in occupa- 
tions, will be the only way to lay moral foundations for them, 
for all moral living is simply taking our lives in terms of social 
obligation, rendering to our age that which we owe to it. Really 
to earn a living, to seek to be useful, to discipline the muscles 
and master the vagrant desires, that we may become good ser- 
vants of the social good, is the first great step in moral living 
and in spiritual self-realization. Specific moral instruction is 
needed that all life may be taken on terms of moral obligation. 
Every word of this is as true of the elementary education of 
the negro as it is of any higher training. We owe it to every 
negro child to make a useful man of him. The universal, com- 
pulsory education of the negro must mean the provision of  
-P-A-G-E-298

training especially for his stage of being, not the attempt to 
make them all ape-like imitators of the white, spectacle-wearing, 
diploma-bearing performers of meaningless, fruitless and mis- 
leading scholastic stunts; not the production of “gents” wearing 
flashy clothes and imitation jewelry, but the directed evolution 
of a race. 
A program of negro education based on his present racial 
needs, conditioned on his own environment and facing his 
development into usefulness, will not be a facile escape from 
present duty. It means a broader thing than giving them the 
schools you have; it means giving them the schools which a 
scientific study of their racial needs will dictate. That will 
cost you brains, time, money and will win opposition from 
superficial sentimentalists. But it will mean building for the 
long future. It would mean undertaking an essentially high 
and spiritual service. 
Ill, FACING GROWING DIFFICULTIES IN THE FIELD OF 
SOCIAL PROBLEMS. 
I refer to the questions of social adjustment, to problems of 
civic and social living. Strikes, graft, industrial oppression, 
the miscarriage of justice, poverty and crime, are all still with 
us. They are not likely to easily grow less, as social living 
passes from the simple to the complex. 
In a relatively simple order of society the function of the 
schools seem to be simple and easily attained. The experience 
of the students is comparatively uniform; their relations are 
similar and the demands of society upon them are easily met. 
But when the life of the city, with its cosmopolitan character, 
its complexities of living, its temptations and variety of pos- 
sibilities is introduced, it is obvious that the schools must pre- 
pare people for a new kind of life. The city frequently involves 
the loss of home consciousness and the decay of neighborliness 
with their power to mould lives, a multiplicity of distractions 
and a variety of types of living. When you add to this the 
industrial situation of the city, the demands on youth to early 
exclusive application to toil, the infinite variety of possible 
tasks the moral strain of the inevitable apparent conflict be- 
tween orders of workers and between employer and employe, it 
is evident that the old simple type of neighborly school will 
not meet the need of the present day.
-P-A-G-E-299
  
       JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 299 
Now, we have expected to meet the need of an increasing 
complex social living in two ways. First, we depended on com- 
pulsory general education. We said, give every child all the 
cultural advantages and knowledge discipline that belongs to a 
gentleman and you will make gentlemen of all. We, therefore, 
selected a wide, inclusive curriculum for the schools and hoped 
to make efficient citizens by a factory process which passed the 
child through the stages of a knowledge mill, the elements being 
determined by the traditional requirements of the gentleman. 
We forgot that the knowledge processes were only incidental 
to the making of a gentleman; that the informational elements 
which the educated men of a few generations ago, the favored 
sons, obtained was only a small fraction of that whole course of 
life which, as an invariable environment surrounded him, 
moulded all his thoughts and habituated his whole life. The 
aim was right, to make every youth a gentleman; that is, one 
who took life in terms of obligation and who, preparing himself 
for the life of usefulness, learned to live in gentleness, good will, 
social harmony and efficiency. But we centered attention on 
the gentleman’s head and forgot his hands and his heart. How 
signally the informational process has failed to make gentle- 
men in this sense of efficient social factors must be evident when 
we consider the statistics of juvenile criminality, not less preva- 
lent among our American school graduates than amongst for- 
eigners, when we remember that the disgraced captains of indus- 
try are the product of our schools and that, as a civilized people, 
we stand disgraced amongst the nations for our popular flout- 
ing of these simplest canons of an honorable life, the canons of 
honesty of action, integrity of word, civic honor and domestic 
purity. It is as though in truth we had trained intellects with- 
out developing wills; our schools have taught us to memorize 
without either guiding us to will aright or inspiring us to 
worthy ideals of conduct. 
Second, we have sought to meet the demands of an increas- 
ingly complex civilization by what we call vocational training. 
This is a wise recognition of ourselves as under obligations to 
render service to society, of the moral obligation of every one 
to do his work and to do it well. As to the values of vocational 
training scarce too much praise cannot be given. Its danger 
lies either in over-emphasis or in wrong aim. Conscious of our   
    
  
-P-A-G-E-300
  300 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
age as distinctly industrial, we are likely to’ hope to make’ full 
men by making efficient hands. We must take heed that voca- 
tional training does not mean the exploitation of our youth 
for the sake of factories and dividends. The aim’ is wrong, too, 
when vocational training means emphasis on the’ mus¢lés as an 
end in themselves. It is of value only as it seeks to make the 
developed moral being. Here is the principal need of our edu- 
cational program today, the development of the person who’ has 
learned to live as a person in a society of persons, who is 
habituated to do right, motived to will good will, and control- 
ing his conduct for the sake of aims and ideals sufficiently high 
to’embrace the good and’ well being of all men. 
The educational problems of a complex society are not the 
problems of labor and a living primarily; they are the problems 
due to an increasing number living in closer relations and to 
the growing variety of these relations. Industry and commerce 
are the avenues which bring people together and soon whirl 
and toss them into struggling masses of social complexity. The 
great matter is that these persons shall become rightly related 
one to another. You cannot solve the problem of this mass of 
struggling, jarring, conflicting persons by procésses of méchani- 
cal regulation and organization. Your regulations, called laws, 
are invalid without the volitional response of the person. The 
effective laws will be only as people will. The essential problem 
of a democracy is not that of regulating people into ideal forma- 
tion, but that of educating them into willing ideal conditions. 
Our problems of industrial strife, graft, corruption, dishonesty 
and crime are not problems of regulation, but of education. 
They are all personal problems at bottom. As Josh Billings 
said, “You will never have an honest horse race till you have an 
honest human race.” They are problems not of intelligence, 
either, but of volition and of ideals. The hope of their solution 
lies only in the training of all men to will to live together in 
harmony and good will and the training each one to render a 
full and efficient service to all. In a word it is a matter, so far 
as the duty of the schools is concerned, of moral education, or, 
as I would prefer to say for the sake of wider meaning and 
sufficient motivation, of religious education. 
Now, the conception of the primacy of our moral needs does 
not mean that we are to throw away all our intellectual dis-
-P-A-G-E-301
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 301 
  ciplines and our yocational training. It does mean that we 
are to conceive and test all these wholly by and for the sake 
of the moral product. The test of an efficient school today is 
the kind of a person it is able to produce; not whether he can 
pass examinations in this or the other field of the world’s 
accumulated knowledge, but whether he has learned to will 
that which is good, to discern that which is right, to follow 
that which is hard and high, and to render the services of a 
trained life. 
An educational program adequate to the future of the South, 
or to any region of our life, must, first of all, determine to 
raise men; socially harmonized and efficient character must 
be its real product. Whatever the curriculum may contain 
must be there for life purposes, and whatever else may be 
learned this must be acquired, the will and power to follow 
the right life. 
Now, we used to think, in past decades, that all the per- 
sonal problems of the universe would be solved by education. 
We believed that when all children went to elementary school 
and the youth to college that we would be done with political 
corruption, business dishonesty, social oppression and injus- 
tice, lawlessness, race hatred and every form of anti-social vice 
and crime. But the classes have graduated, the schools have 
turned their product loose on society, and still the social fer- 
ment augments, the problems grow. blacker and our hearts 
often fail within us. Education has failed to solve the social 
problems with us because it has been primarily intellectual in 
character. We have tried to train minds, to pack intellects, to 
cram memories. We have planned our schools as packing 
houses of information. We have tested education by ability 
to do memory stunts and mental gymnastics. We have thought, 
or acted, in our schools as though we believed that children 
were walking intellects, memories, machines built only to 
know, scarcely to think or to reason, still less to feel and to 
will. For the battle of life, for the perplexities of its ways, 
we have furnished the youth with the lumber of dead ages 
and with staggering heaps of alleged facts and masses of 
information. He quickly discarded all the junk when he 
turned to tackle his first real life-problems. But see what 
we have missed of opportunity really to equip him for the
-P-A-G-E-302
302 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
  burdens and business of living and of giving a life of useful 
service to his day! 
Yet we turn once again, with hope and confidence, to the 
forces of education, believing they are competent to prepare 
youth to the future. The teachers of the South can work out 
a system of education for all the youth of the South adequate 
to the future of the South. They will do this if they are loyal 
to their own ideals and are free from the hamperings of cheap 
politicians and fussy, amateurish and often corrupt school 
boards. 
There is just one guiding principle which will apply to all 
the problems of education as they rise in the South; it is, that 
the business of education is the development of efficient per- 
sonality. The schools exist to grow the life of youth in the 
growing period into the best possible type of rightly ordered 
personal and social living. The normal product of the schools 
is trained, adjusted, well-motived efficient citizens. The busi- 
ness of studies, the courses, the training in arts and trades, 
are all but the means by which the great end is secured; they 
are not ends in themselves. An educator is not one who causes 
us to know many things, but one who by leading us, stimulat- 
ing us to the knowledge of things, brings us to the knowledge 
and development of ourselves. You can never test any system 
of education by the degrees it confers. Hanging degrees on 
a donkey’s ears in no way affects his vocal organs. We must 
test all our educational institutions by the product of man- 
hood and womanhood competent to live the life and do the 
service of their day. 
Specifically what will be the salient features of a general 
policy of education adequate to the future of the South? 
1. The adoption, by her educators, of the moral aim as the 
dominant and determinative purpose of the public schools. 
2. A steady program of the education of public opinion to 
appreciate and accept the moral aim and to test the schools 
by their efficiency in the development of competent social 
character, also the education of the public will to provide the 
funds and facilities adequately to carry on this work. This 
would include more adequate physical equipment, salaries that 
would attract higher personalities capable of moral leader- 
ship, provision for universal elementary education covering 
the first eight grades.

                 3. Preparation of teachers in normal schools and teachers’ 
colleges in the science of moral training. The larger schools 
should have special instructors and the smaller ones could 
share traveling lectureships, while, most of all, the moral aim 
of the public school would permeate all the curricula of the 
training schools. 
4. Test all the present school curricula by the moral and 
social aim of the school. Now is the time to determine whether 
the schoo] is to exist for studies or for life—for the traditional 
learning which was supposed to mark a gentleman, or for the 
training that will make our youth competent to the tasks of 
their manhood? Shall the public school be for the few who 
go on to the professions, or for the many who must work with 
their hands? This involves new relationship with the colleges 
and academies. The South is in a better position to work out 
this readjustment than the North. 3 
5. Provide schools according to needs. As suggested above, 
special schools for all negroes, compulsory as to attendance, 
independent in curriculum, aiming to develop him to a life 
of usefulness, to train him to steady progress in his own race, 
unitary with them. This item also would mean the provision 
of different types of schools for the white race in the city, in 
industrial centers and in rural communities. We need more 
of specialization in the elementary schools, not alone nor so 
much in teaching trades, but in that whole training which 
has in mind the pupil’s environment as well as his vocation. 
6. Foster special experiments in selected schools and cities, 
particularly experiments in moral training, but also in admin- 
istration and revision of curricula. The greatest foe of prog- 
ress is the fear to initiate and to experiment. We especially 
need experimentation as to the relation of the school to the 
physical well being and culture of the child. 
7. Such undertakings as these already suggested should be 
under the general direction and encouragement of at least two 
strong committees of the S. E. A., two committees which would 
be the strongest in all your officiary and which would be pro- 
vided with sufficient funds for their work. 
(a) Committee on moral training, to maintain a scientific 
study of aims, methods, materials, etc., and to make reports 
embodying practical suggestions to teachers and to schools.
-P-A-G-E-304
304 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  (b) Committee on school efficiency, to study the work of the 
schools in view of the industrial, social and civic needs of the 
age, to keep the schools up to the demands of the times, to 
become investigators of scientific schoolmanship. 
8. In all the problems and opportunities of the South in her 
work of public education, we hope that her educators will feel 
assured of and make full use of the hearty, steady, practical, 
and, as we trust, valuable services of the Religious Education 
Association. (Applause.) 
Tur Cuair: The man whom I will now present to this 
splendid audience really needs no introduction to the Ameri- 
can people. His high ideals of civic duty, his noble conception 
of citizenship, have endeared him to the American people. He 
stands high among the first men of this nation and I sincerely 
hope that he, at some future time, will be the first citizen of 
this great Republic, the President of the United States! (Ap- 
plause.) I am sure no greater good could befall the American 
people than to haye Joseph W. Folk in the White House! 
(Renewed applause.) I now present to you Joseph W. Folk, 
‘of Missouri, who will address you on 
EDUCATION IN A REPUBLIC. 
JOSEPH W. FOLK, MISSOURI. 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
I am glad Mr. Cassidy gave you the subject of my address, 
but the subject of an address does not make so very much 
difference, after all. Over in Iowa at one of the colleges, not 
very long ago, some one was to make a talk upon the subject 
of “Love, a Cosmic Force.” The man who introduced the 
speaker said he would talk on the subject of “Love, a Comic 
Force.” The speaker did not call attention to the mistake, but 
went ahead and delivered the original address, and the audi- 
ence neyer noticed the difference. (Laughter.) But my sub- 
ject has been given correctly. 
It is a mere truism to say that the perpetuity of a republi- 
ean form of government depends upon the constant creation 
and wise use of educational facilities. If every university 
were closed, every schoolhouse shut, every teacher’s lips sealed, 
the result in a few years would be chaos, anarchy; and as an

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 305 
  entire lack of education of the masses must lead to disaster, so: 
the more the masses can be mentally enlightened, the greater 
the governmental benefit and the more the rights of the indi- 
vidual are safeguarded. 
The child of today will be the sovereign of the Nation tomor- 
row. As the State has the right, in order to protect society, 
to punish crime, so the State has the right to demand the edu- 
cation of the children who will be the citizens of the years. to 
come. Years ago there was great prejudice against compul- 
sory educational laws, but I am glad to know that prejudice 
is rapidly passing away. It used to be argued that the State 
had no right to go into the home of a man and take his chil- 
dren and educate them without the consent of the parent; but 
we have learned that it is less harsh for the State to make a 
useful citizen of the child through education than for the 
State to be compelled to imprison it in after years for crime, 
without the parent’s consent. (Applause.) 
The criminal institutions of the land are crowded with the 
ignorant and uneducated. Crime and vice go hand in hand 
with ignorance. For every dollar the State spends in educa- 
tion she receives tenfold its value in better citizenship, in 
greater regard for the things that make for the common good. 
(Applause. ) 
Another thing which has been agitating the country for a 
good many years in connection with education is the child- 
labor question. When I was Governor of Missouri, I went 
through some of the great factories of that State. I saw little 
children seven to nine years old working and toiling at the 
looms or in some other capacity. In many instances it was 
claimed a child was the sole support of some indigent parent, 
but in a majority of the cases investigated it was found that 
these claims were not bona fide. I have always thought that 
a man who is so poor as to depend on the labor of a little child 
is poor enough for the State to support him as a pauper. He 
has no right to ruin that child mentally, morally and physi- 
cally, as is done when the child at a tender age is placed at 
work in a factory! (Applause.) Child labor is an enemy to 
civilization, and an awakened public conscience is beginning 
to recognize it as such. Not only do we need better educational 
laws of wider application, but we need more attention paid 
20 
 
-P-A-G-E-306
  306 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
to the education of the many instead of exhausting the most 
of our energies on the higher education of the few. (Ap- 
plause.) 
It is well enough for men of great wealth to endow univer- 
sities; but it would be better if some of those millions were 
expended on the common schools for the education of the 
average man. (Applause.) It is a commendable thing to 
give libraries to cities and towns, but if some of the millions 
going into those libraries were given to the cause of common 
education, the public benefit would be greater. Let the masses 
be educated and libraries will spring upon every hand without 
being donated. Let the masses be ignorant and the costliest 
library buildings will be mere ornaments; the rarest of books 
will moulder in disuse. We need universities, we need 
libraries; but the need of these things should not cause us 
to forget that every State needs more common schools, better 
equipment, more teachers, better paid teachers (applause), and 
better teachers (applause), for no school can be better than 
the teacher makes it. 
In foreign lands, ruled by kings and emperors, the child 
destined to be a king is educated with especial reference to the 
duties of sovereignty which are to devolve upon that child in 
after years. In this country, where every child will be in 
part a sovereign, too little attention is paid in the public 
schools to instilling in the minds and hearts of the children 
the duties of citizenship in a free country where every man 
is in part a king. 
As I came into the hall here tonight, Mrs. Mead was talking 
of the new patriotism. There is a new patriotism in the land 
today, or rather a new idea of patriotism. The old conception 
of patriotism was that a man should go out on the battlefield 
and risk his life for his country. We have now learned that 
there is a patriotism of peace as well as a patriotism of war. 
Some nine years ago there was held in the city of St. Louis 
a banquet attended by a number of prominent business men. 
After the repast was over the band played “America,” and 
the audience stood and sang the words. As the strains died 
away one man, with tears of delight trickling down his cheeks, 
said, “Oh, I wish I could die for my country!” Three weeks 
after that that man was on his knees confessing that he had
-P-A-G-E-307
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 307 
bribed the municipal assembly! That man was a type. Many 
men would be willing to give up their lives for the State or 
country, and that sentiment cannot be too highly commended ; 
but the man who will live every day for his country is the 
man the country needs most just now. (Applause.) Children 
should be taught that there is as much patriotism in living 
for one’s country as in dying for one’s country. Patriotism 
does not abide alone in the roar of the cannon, midst the din 
and clash of arms, but in the every-day duties of civic life as 
well. The man who gives his time to bettering civic conditions 
and to the righting of public wrongs may be as much a patriot 
as the man who bares his breast to the enemies’ bullets in time 
of war. It is upon this common, every-day patriotism that 
the safety of the republic rests. 
Go where you will, from the largest city to the smallest 
hamlet, and you will find the decent people are in the majority 
everywhere. Emerson says that every man alone is conscien- 
tious. That is only another way of stating what I believe to be 
true, that ninety-five out of every hundred men are honest; that 
is, when they have no selfish reason to be otherwise. (Laugh- 
ter.) Selfishness causes nearly all the trouble in this world, 
but even with the selfishness I believe a majority of decent 
people are left; but those who compose the vicious minority 
are always active, while the forces that compose the decent 
majority are less active. If the forces of honesty and decency 
had always been as active as the forces of graft and greed, the 
millenium would have been reached on earth. If patriotism 
could be made as active as rottenness, the problems of good 
government could soon be solved everywhere. We do not need 
more honest men and women—there are plenty of honest peo- 
ple—but we do need more men and women who can be aggres- 
sively honest. Negative honesty is the very next thing to posi- 
tive dishonesty. This table may be said to be honest, in the 
sense that it is not dishonest; but a man should be more than 
passively honest; he should be actively honest. We need more 
men and women who are not afraid to show their colors and 
let the world know where they stand. 
Some four years ago I received a letter from one of the 
counties of Missouri, signed by a hundred citizens of a town- 
ship, complaining that the law was not enforced in that town-
-P-A-G-E-308
308 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  ship, and asking me to direct the sheriff to enforce the law. 
I wrote to the sheriff about it and he replied that he would 
like to have the names of those 100 men, for he would like 
to have them help him enforce the law. I sent the names to 
him. Two or three days afterward I received a letter from 
a man whose name appeared on the petition, asking me, “By 
what principle of ethics did you send to the sheriff the list 
of names we sent to you asking for the enforcement of the 
law. You have got us all into trouble.” I wrote back: “I 
sent the sheriff the list of names you sent me because I believe 
that any man who is afraid to show his colors is of no benefit 
to good government.” He wrote back and said he humbly 
begged my pardon, that he had not thought of it in that light 
before, but that he had talked with the others who had signed 
it and they had concluded that from that time on they were 
going to be just as bold as the other fellows; they were going 
to be just as courageous in standing up for the right as the 
others were for the wrong. The result was there was no more 
trouble in that township. What was done there can be done 
anywhere. A dozen aggressively righteous men and women 
can bring about a reign of civic righteousness anywhere. But 
not only must they be righteous—mere righteousness availeth 
nothing—they must be aggressively righteous if they do any 
good. 
The greatest impediment to progress is the indifference of 
the average decent citizen. He is too apt to say, “What can 
Ido? I am only one and can accomplish little or nothing at 
all.” The man who dares attack wrong, even though single- 
handed, has an influence that cannot be estimated. One may be 
in the minority, but one in the right will usually constitute a 
majority in the end. 
This government of ours is no better than any other except 
as the lifters make it so. In fact, a government by the people 
is the very worst form of government the human brain could 
conceive of unless the people take the trouble to govern them- 
selves; for if they do not do it, then they will be governed 
by the selfish interests having a special purpose in controling 
the governments of cities, of States, and the government of 
the Nation. 
In a government by the people, there is an individual re-
-P-A-G-E-309
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 309 
  sponsibility for the affairs of the government that should be 
impressed upon the school children everywhere. If anything is 
wrong you are to blame, for the people in a government by 
the people can get just as good a government as they want 
to make it, or just as bad as they permit it to become. When 
the decent element neglect their civic duties, then corruption, 
the child of greed and avarice, always springs up. Abraham 
Lincoln said a few days before his death that he feared more 
for the safety of the Republic through the selfishness and cor- 
ruption which might follow the war, than from the war itself. 
How well did he prophesy! 
For a few years after the war the people were so busy solv- 
ing the problems arising out of that fierce conflict that mat- 
ters of government were lost sight of, and when they awakened 
to a knowledge of what was going on they found that corrup- 
tion had entered the municipalities, that some State legisla- 
tures were selling Jaws like merchandise, and even some 
officials of the national government were involved. Men gave 
bribes and thought nothing of it; men took bribes and boasted. 
The people were at last awakened to the fact that a govern- 
ment by bribery was not a government, of, for, and by the 
people, but a government of, for, and by the few with wealth 
enough to purchase official favors. The came a stern demand 
for a cessation of the offense that strikes at the heart of free 
government. The public conscience was aroused on the sub- 
ject. 
But ten years ago men took and gave bribes and still con- 
sidered themselves honest men. It is a strange fact that some 
men who would take or give bribes would be honest in other 
cases. I remember a case of a member of the House of Dele- 
gates of St. Louis, who confessed to having taken bribes in 
certain cases for a dozen years. In speaking of another mem- 
ber, he said he was not an honest man. Being asked what he 
called “dishonesty,” he said this man, if sent to get the bribe 
money, would stick part of it in his own pocket—and that 
was what he called a dishonest man! That was his idea of 
dishonesty, a very common idea at the time. 
In another case, a man sold his vote for $25,000 in a certain 
matter of franchise, and afterwards a representative of the 
other side came along and paid him $50,000 to vote against 
 
-P-A-G-E-310
310 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  it. The delegate returned the $25,000 with a note, saying 
he did not think he could conscientiously earn the money. He 
prided himself on his conscientiousness! Then he turned 
State’s evidence against the man who paid him the fifty 
thousand. 
During the course of the trial the attorney for the defendant 
asked him, “Why did you send back the twenty-five thousand 
dollars and keep the fifty thousand? You committed a crime 
when you did so—why didn’t you keep the twenty-five thou- 
sand?” The witness looked at him in injured innocence, then 
shaking his finger at the attorney, he said: “I want you to 
understand right here and now that I am too honest a man 
to take money from both sides!” That was his idea of honesty, 
and a very common idea at that time. 
Today when we pick up a newspaper, we find accounts of 
graft and fraud in many American States, and exposures going 
on. In the New York Legislature there was such an instance, 
and a member was expelled for corruption. In the State of 
Ohio, exposures in the Legislature disclosed an amazing mass 
of rottenness. In Illinois, seat in the Senate of the United 
States was purchased, and then the Senate voted to exonerate 
the man thus having secured a seat therein, making his elec- 
tion and the way he was elected a national shame and a 
national disgrace. (Applause.) Another investigation is being 
held in the Lorimer matter, however, the result of which will 
probably be very different; for the United States Senate is 
now being touched with a live coal from oft the altar of publie 
conscience. Corruption has stalked through the halls of Con- 
gress unashamed and unafraid, and has become so wanton 
that even the blind Senator from Oklahoma could see it and 
protest against it. (Applause.) 
Now, the exposures in New York, St. Louis, California, 
Seattle, Pittsburg, Philadelphia, Ohio, Illinois, the Sugar 
Trust frauds, etc—what do they mean? Are the American 
people becoming a nation of robbers and crooks? Is there 
more tendency to violate the command, “Thou shalt not steal,” 
than there used to be? Is corruption more general than 
formerly? You must remember that for every wrong act 
brought to light there are scores beneath the surface that never 
become known. If you will multiply each exposure by twenty,
-P-A-G-E-311
      JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 311 
you will get some faint conception of the real crookedness 
going on. Nevertheless, I do not believe there is more corrup- 
tion than there was ten years ago. On the other hand, I think 
there is less. There is more being exposed, but that is the 
difference. Ten years ago corruption was being covered up; 
today it is being uncovered. At that time, crookedness was 
being looked on either indifferently or despairingly. Today 
is it being fought against everywhere. Public opinion is better 
educated; the public conscience has been aroused and will 
not submit quietly to graft as it did. This educated public 
conscience is marching on and on, day after day correcting 
some evil, day after day fighting some wrong. 
Ten years ago the open gambling house was very common 
in nearly all large cities. Today the open gambling house has 
disappeared except where corrupt officials allow it. Race track 
gambling even half a dozen years ago was not considered as 
involving serious moral turpitude; but today the educated con- 
science of the people in many of the States has ended this 
practice, and it will only be a little while until this criminal- 
making vice will be a thing of the past in all States. 
Better liquor laws, anti-lobbying laws, enacted in so many 
States, also give evidence of this educated public conscience. 
The measures being advocated for more popular government 
also show that the people have been educated to their rights 
in government. The primary system which so many of the 
States now have was not in operation in any of them a few 
years ago. The primary system is not perfect, but as imperfect 
as it is I believe it is far preferable to the old convention idea, 
under which the boss was usually supreme. The political boss 
is generally a man of very strong mentality, but very feeble 
morality. He is the connecting link between the criminal rich 
and the criminal poor. He is employed by special interests 
and devotes his entire time to politics, so that he is enabled 
to control conventions and have the few reap where the many 
sow. He still has too much influence under the primary ‘sys- 
tem, but not as much as under the convention plan, and by 
just that much the primary plan is preferable. 
The initiative and referendum, which has been adopted in 
many States, also indicates this educated conscience of the 
people is being awakened. Eight years ago I advocated the    
  
-P-A-G-E-312
312 SOUTHERN EDUOATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  initiative and referendum as the best means of stopping cor- 
ruption in our Legislature. Four years ago it was adopted 
and ended corruption in our General Assembly. What use is 
it for anyone to bribe a legislature to pass a bill, when the 
people have the power to veto any bad law which the legis- 
lature many enact? (Applause.) What would be the use 
ef anyone bribing the legislature not to pass a good bill, when 
‘the people have the power, through the initiative, to enact 
sany law over the head of the legislature? For the purpose of 
venacting all laws, these measures are entirely too cumbersome, 
‘but as checks in the hands of the people over their Legislature 
they are very effective. Like the power of impeachment, their 
very existence has a tendency to keep things straight and pre- 
vent the very abuses requiring their use. Instead of destroy- 
ing representative government, these measures preserve repre- 
sentative government by insuring a government representing 
the people and not special interests. 
Government by the people is either right or wrong. If it 
is wrong, then this Republic is the mightiest blunder of all 
the ages. If government by the people is right, then the people 
cannot be given too much power to run their own government. 
Applause.) 
The commission form of city government, which was born 
right here in Texas in the neighboring city of Galveston, and 
which I understand has been adopted in Houston, is another 
good step in the right direction. Ten years ago there were 
none, while today 136 cities and towns in the United States 
operate under that plan; and in twenty years I believe that 
every city and town in the United States of consequence will 
be operating under the commission plan. After all, the com- 
mission plan is merely a simplified form of city government, 
and the simpler the government can be made, the more govern- 
ment by the people there will be; and the more complex the 
government can be made, the less government by the people 
there will be. 
But the initiative and referendum, the primary plan, and 
the commission form of city government cannot bring good 
government in themselves. No law can produce good govern- 
‘ment automatically. The most any law can do is to afford 
the people, through that law, opportunity to obtain good gov-
-P-A-G-E-313
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 313 
ernment by their own acts. No matter what the laws may be, 
the question of good government always comes back in the 
last analysis to the activity and aggressiveness of the good 
people. Good government must begin in the home, at the 
mother’s knee, in the school, and go from there to the city, to 
the county, to the State, and to the Nation. Do not forget 
that it is not only good government we want, but good govern- 
ment through self-government. There may be good government 
under a king, but such is not self-government; and I believe 
good government without self-government is not as desirable 
as bad government with self government. What we want in 
this country is good government through self-government. 
The only way the people can govern in a government by the 
people is through the laws that they make, either directly or 
through representatives. If those laws are not enforced, then 
the will of the people is thwarted to the extent that the laws 
are not carried out; and to that degree, instead of government 
by the people, there is government by the few with wealth and 
influence enough to affect official conduct. 
Laws are of two kinds. The violation of one kind results in 
private injury and public wrong. If a man robs another, it 
is a private injury and a public wrong. If he shoots another, 
it is the same. In such cases, the machinery of the law is 
put in motion by the injured parties to punish the offender. 
But the violation of the liquor, gambling, railroad rebating 
laws, etc., is simply a public wrong without private injury, 
as a rule; and it is in the enforcement of the laws involving 
simply a public wrong that difficulty comes, in government by 
the people. Those who have been to England, or any country 
under king or emperor, have observed how much better these 
laws for the protection of the public are enforced in those 
countries than under this government by the people, and there 
is a reason. The reason is, that in this Republic too often the 
very interests concerned in violating the laws will elect the 
man whose duty it is to enforce the law. There is an em- 
bezzlement of public power, which is far more dangerous in a 
republic than embezzlement of public money; for money em- 
bezzled may be recovered or replaced, but power embezzled is 
gone forever. Officials have vested in them certain powers to 
be exercised for the public good. If an officer has power to  
-P-A-G-E-314
  314 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
enforce the people’s laws and fails to do so, either through 
private or political considerations, he embezzles the power im- 
posed on him by the people, and he is just as guilty, morally 
speaking, as if he placed his hand in the public treasury and 
took therefrom money to pay a private debt. The time will 
come in this country, as the public conscience becomes more 
and more educated, when embezzlement of public power will 
be just as great an offense upon the statute books as the 
embezzlement of public money now is. 
But with all the wrongs we still must fight, I do not believa 
there is cause for despair. On the contrary, I think there is 
hope for the future by reason of this educated conscience of 
the public. If things had gone on as they were a few years 
ago, when bribery was looked on with indifference, when law- 
lessness was regarded with despair, then the end of this Repub- 
lie itself might well have been prophesied; for we were going 
the way other republics have gone that have passed to their 
death in the flight of time through the ages. This is not the 
first republic, nor the oldest. One hundred and thirty-six 
years is a long time as compared with the life of man, but 
a short time in the history of nations. Rome had a republican 
form of government for five hundred years; Athens, with 
various interruptions, nine hundred years; Venice, three hun- 
dred years. What caused their death? It was not lack of 
money, but lack of men. They ceased to exist, not for want 
of material wealth, but for lack of moral health. Some of 
those who lived in those republics were highly educated, but 
the masses of the people had no education at all. There were 
a few more intellectual than we have today; there were some 
more advanced in learning than the highest of the present; but 
one may search through the ruins of those ancient republics 
for a trace of a single institution for the education of the 
masses. There was not one, in all of Rome, nor Athens, nor 
Venice, nor Carthage, nor Florence—not one. Those were 
civilizations of the few, while ours is a civilization of indi- 
vidual enlightenment. Under those civilizations there could 
be no awakening of the public conscience. Under our civiliza- 
tion, with its ideals of individual enlightenment, for the first 
time in the world’s history there is a public conscience that 
may be aroused to condemn the wrong and to approve the
-P-A-G-E-315
JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 315 
  right. And it is by reason of these ideals on which our Repub- 
lic was founded that this world has made more progress in 
invention since this Republic has been in existence than the 
world had made in a thousand years before. Why, Washing- 
ton had no better way for transporting his troops than Caesar 
had two thousand years before! He could not communicate 
with distant commands by swifter methods than could Alexan- 
der the Great! The wonders of steam, the telephone, and the 
telegraph were not dreamed of then. Any man here who is 
sixty years old has seen more progress than any man who lived 
before him in all the history of the world! And some of the 
younger of us can recall the first electric light and the first 
electric car; and it is only within the past six or seven years 
that wireless telegraphy became an accomplished fact, whereby 
our ocean steamers can communicate with the outside world 
as they race across the sea. 
The magical age in which we live is the direct outgrowth 
of these ideals of brotherhood and individual enlightenment ; 
and the nearer we can keep to these ideals, the more progress 
we shall make; and the farther removed from them, the more 
removed we shall be from the ideal republic we all hope for. 
Notwithstanding all the evils we must constantly fight, not- 
withstanding the fact that the battle for the right is never 
over and the fight against wrong never quite finished, I be 
lieve that owing to this educated public conscience, the world 
is growing better and better every day, not worse. 
Poets have sung of a golden age that lies buried somewhere 
way back in the history of the world; but I believe the golden 
age is before, not behind us, and that it will come when there 
is more of the Golden Rule and less of the Rule of Gold, in 
the government and in our daily lives; when there is more of 
brotherhood and charity, and less of selfishness, of avarice, of 
graft, and of greed. (Applause.) Even now, wealth irre- 
spective of its source is not worshipped as it used to be, and 
gold irrespective of its source is not looked upon with the 
awe it used to be. The ideal of the young man is becoming 
more and more to get right and keep right, rather than to 
get and stay rich. This new standard is just plain, simple, 
aggressive honesty; that is all. Political leaders are coming 
to believe honesty the best politics as well as the best policy, 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
  316 SOUTHERN HDUOATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
as it used to be considered. Corrupt men, when attacked, were 
wont to hide behind the political shield of some party and 
claim that party was being served. But we have learned that 
a rascal is a rascal still, whether he is a Democrat, Republican, 
Socialist, or what. In my opinion, as between a Democrat 
who violates the law and a Republican who violates the law, 
I would have the Democrat punished first, because he ought 
to know better. (Laughter.) A Republican friend of mine 
who heard me say that not long ago said that as between the 
Democrat and the Republican violator of the law, he would 
have the Republican punished first, because he does know 
better! (Laughter.) However, the man who violates the law 
is neither a Democrat nor a Republican. He is a criminal, and 
ought to be treated as such by the honest men of the political 
parties. (Applause.) 
There is a constant battle between the public good and pri- 
vate greed, between right and wrong, between vice and virtue. 
The puble good, the truth, the right, the virtue, must always 
be fought for. The greed of a few, the wrong, the bad, the 
false must always be fought against. The farmer must sow 
his wheat and corn; he must care for them and nurture them; 
while the briars and the thistles sown by accident, cared 
for by chance, will flourish anywhere. A field neglected will 
not grow useful grain, but the useless weed. The child 
neglected will not become virtuous and educated of itself (ap- 
plause), but will become vicious. A government neglected 
will not become a government for the common good, but will 
surely become a government for private greed. The lesson 
which all nature teaches is that whatever is good, whether in 
our lives or in the government, must be fought for, while the 
bad thrives on its own wickedness. 
Now these things may be ideal, but do not forget that ideals 
and ideas are the life of a free people. We are made and 
governed by the things we cherish. The public life of a nation 
is simply a reflection of its private life. Take away the ideals 
from the hearts of a people and the strength of the nation 
would be gone. Rome built great highways and founded 
mighty cities, while the strength of Roman character ebbed 
away, and when that was gone there was nothing to defend, 
nothing to conquer.
-P-A-G-E-317
JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGS. 317 
  There is an old story of an Eastern king who caused a great 
palace to be erected as the abode of majesty and power. Stone 
by stone the structure grew, and the heart of the king swelled 
with pride. One morning the place was found in ruins, hardly 
one stone left standing on another. 
“What great treason has been committed here?” the king 
exclaimed ; and a price was put on the head of the traitor who 
had destroyed the abode of majesty. But a wise man thus 
addressed the king: “Great Master, there has been no treason. 
Thy house has fallen down because the builders used mortar 
without sand. 
We may calculate our wealth by the sands of the sea; we 
may build domes of capitols until they pierce the clouds and 
glitter among the stars; but all must fall and crumble away 
unless welded and strengthened by those principles of univer- 
sal education that constitute the groundwork of enlightened 
citizenship. Here between two great oceans we have founded 
an empire such as no conqueror of old ever dreamed of; a 
Republic that is the hope of the oppressed of every land! 
God’s melting pot, as has. been said here tonight, into which 
he is throwing all the races of the earth, and by mixing and 
mingling them evolving the superman of the future! But 
greatness of a nation does not consist alone of acreage of 
territory, nor strength of battleships, but in purity of ideals 
and intensity of devotion to those principles of right and 
justice and education that must make for the welfare of a 
free people. In vain will we build battleships, fortify our 
coasts, and man our guns, unless into every rampart there be 
brought these ideas and ideals that make the men behind the 
guns! (Applause.) 
Let us preserve these ideals! Let us unite in enforcing the 
laws and in counteracting any attempt to defy them! Let us 
join in sincere devotion to a religious faith with the broadest 
religious toleration. Let us not array class against class, but 
preserve the rights of all by causing each to respect the rights 
of the other. Let us not attack wealth in itself, but the unfair 
privileges out of which tainted riches grow. Let us protect 
property rights, but let us not forget that property rights 
should not be inconsistent with public rights. Let us not 
combat men, but the evil men do. Let us seek a remedy for 
 
-P-A-G-E-318

  existing wrong—not less government by the people, but more 
government by the people; not more money, but more man- 
hood; not more cunning, but more conscience. Let us place 
the common good above private greed, and thus find that 
righteousness that exalteth a nation! (Great applause.) 
Tue Cuair: This makes a fitting climax to the great meet- 
ings we have had. I will ask the audience to retain their 
seats until the new President comes to the stage. I will also 
ask the Secretary, Mr. Feagin, to come forward. (Mr. Feagin 
fails to respond.) 
Ladies and Gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to resign 
the honor which I have held for a year to such a man as him 
whom I shall present, Dr. H. L. Whitford, of Mississippi. I 
bespeak for him a growing Southern Educational Association. 
(Applause. ) 
Dr, Wuitrietp: I do not know whether my coming upon 
the stage or the program we have had tonight was the fitting 
culmination of which our worthy retiring President spoke. 
(Laughter.) But I thank you from the bottom of my heart 
for the great trust and responsibility you have seen fit to put 
upon me. 
Our institution has passed through the various stages of 
development. We have had the period of discovery, the period 
of enthusiasm, and the period of glittering generalities. We 
had to have all those; but we must remember, my fellow 
teachers, that with all the good things we have heard during 
this meeting, the culmination of which we have had tonight, 
if this country is to be what it can and ought to be, it must 
be brought about by having the right kind of people. (Ap- 
plause.) The people are the producing cause of everything, 
and it is in the school that we must make these people. The 
object of our work from now on should be to secure an Ameri- 
can school system which will bring to the people these splendid 
things we have heard tonight. So, at the next meeting, let us 
get more into the detail and work out something of practical, 
tangible value to the teachers who are working in the South 
today, so they may be able to do this work which they will not 
be able to do without such assistance. (Applause.) 
Again, I thank you for your confidence, and want to ask 
the help of everyone. My initials are “W. L.,” and my address

is, “Columbus, Mississippi.” If you have a suggestion which 
may help our work, write me. 
Tan Cam: Thanking the people of Houston and of the 
great State of Texas for all their kindness and for what they 
have done toward making this a great meeting, I bid you 
goodbye! (Applause.)

REPORTS OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN 
THE SOUTH. 
ALABAMA—HENRY J, WILLINGHAM, STATE SUPERINTENDENT. 
During the twelve months intervening since the last meeting 
of the Southern Educational Association, activities in Alabama 
touching schools have been directed for the most part in secur- 
ing and trying to secure needed legislation during the session 
of the Legislature through the months of January, February, 
March and April, of 1911, and to the subsequent work of put- 
ting into execution the new laws passed. The most important 
of these laws were as follows: 
1. An act removing from the office of county superintendent 
the duty of handling the public school money in any way what- 
ever, except that he continue to make out the monthly payrolls. 
The office of county treasurer of public schqol funds was pro- 
vided in each county without pay, in order to relieve the county 
superintendents of the responsibility and extra work of hand- 
ling the funds, thus enabling them to have more time for the 
supervision of their schools. 
2. The law requiring the location and maintenance of 
special public schools for children employed by manufacturing 
establishments. 
8. A law authorizing the sale and conveyance of school 
 
-P-A-G-E-321
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 321 
  property. This enactment was intended to enable communities 
to concentrate into fewer and better schools by disposing of 
and abandoning some school property now in use. A com- 
panion bill, authorizing the expenditure of certain funds to: 
pay the transportation charges of children to central schools, 
passed the House, but was defeated on a close vote in the 
Senate, thus preventing in a large measure, for the present, 
our desire to begin actively the movement of providing central 
schools and the concentration of several smaller schools into 
one good one. This subject, however, is taking root in the- 
minds of the people throughout the State, and in some local- 
ities reports are already received indicating the fact that the 
people in some places are taking this matter into their own 
hands, recognizing the importance of having fewer but better 
schools. No general movement, however, of serious conse- 
quence can bring results in consolidating rural schools until 
the Legislature authorizes the expenditure of some public 
funds for transportation charges. 
4. A board of trustees consisting of eight members, includ- 
ing the Governor and the Superintendent of Education, ea- 
officio, was created to take the place of the several boards which 
hitherto have controlled under separate management the six 
white normal schools of this State. The beneficial effects from 
this legislation in the standardization of normal school work 
are already apparent. 
5. A law was passed authorizing the establishment of rural 
school libraries in communities of less than 1,000 inhabitants. 
The communities are to raise $10 each; the commissioner’s 
court is authorized thereupon to add $10 each out of the 
county revenues, whereupon the State appropriates $10 to each 
community, making in all $30 as a minimum for each of ten 
communities in each county annually, for the purchase of 
books and the maintenance of a rural school library. This 
little appropriation from the State of $6,700 annually (there 
being sixty-seven counties), carries with it the “rider” fixed 
by the Governor to all new appropriations, thus permitting 
the law to become operative only when, in the opinion of the 
Governor, the condition of the treasury will warrant. I have 
good reason to believe that this law will be allowed by the 
Governor to become operative during the present month. 
21

6. The work of holding teachers’ institutes was completely 
revolutionized by a law which appropriates $5,000 annually 
for the holding of institutes for white teachers and $1,500 
annually for the holding of institutes for colored teachers. 
Last summer a teachers’ institute of one week, under the direc- 
tion of paid professional instructors, was held in each county 
for the benefit of white teachers, and ten similar, well-attended 
institutes were held in the centers of negro population for 
negro teachers. The marked improvement already manifest 
through the operation of this law, in developing an enthusias- 
tic spirit on the part of the teachers, to say nothing of the 
highly beneficial results in the way of specific training thus 
received, are already strongly evidenced. 
  ARKANSAS—GEORGE B. COOK, STATE SUPERINTENDENT. 
The growth of our public school system has been constant 
since its reorganization thirty-five years ago, but the develop- 
ment during the decade just closed has been remarkable. Ten 
years ago the value of all public school property was approxi- 
mately $2,500,000; today it is over $7,000,000. 
During this same time the school population has increased 
over 100,000, more than 20 per cent, and the annual school 
revenues more than doubled. The average length of the school 
year in 1900 was 77.4 days, in 1910 it was 106.5; that is to 
say, a full school month has been added to our school term. 
The number of teachers employed has increased from less than 
7,000 to more than 9,500. We have now one teacher for every 
60 pupils of school age, whereas ten years ago there was one 
teacher for every 72 of the school population. Since 1900, 
there have been erected 2,731 new school buildings, aggregating 
in value $3,395,083 ; the revenue per capita of each census child 
has increased from $4.13 to $7.82; and the average monthly 
salary paid teachers has advanced from $32 per school month 
to $56 per school month. 
In 1910 there were 3,767,970 more days of school attendance 
than in 1909. This gain in actual school for the past year is 
equivalent to seven years’ schooling for 5,054 pupils. The 
biennial term just closed has been peculiarly remarkable for 
public school progress. The total value of school property 
has increased $2,000,000, and two and one-half weeks added

  to the length of the school term. The four agricultural schools 
have been established. Summer normal terms were instituted 
for the benefit of teachers, and a six weeks’ course was offered 
at the State Normal School and the State University. Com- 
pulsory school attendance laws became effective in 40 counties. 
Under the provisions of the act of 1907, creating the office of 
county superintendent of schools eight have elected county 
superintendents. 
Recent educational legislation: The thirty-eighth General 
Assembly of Arkansas, 1911, added much in the way of pro- 
gressive and remedial educational legislation to the statutes 
of Arkansas. A State Board of Education was created with 
general administrative powers. An act permitting the con- 
solidation of weak school districts and the transportation of 
pupils was passed. State aid to high schools was made pos- 
sible. 
Twenty additional counties were included in the operation 
of the compulsory school attendance laws. The law permitting 
special school districts in rural communities was amended, 
and the salary of the county superintendents increased and 
their duties made clear. The State Department of Public In- 
struction was strengthened by adding to the force an assistant 
deputy. 
Liberal appropriations for the maintenance of the State 
University, State Normal School, Branch Normal for colored 
teachers, the four Agriculturals Schools, the Deaf Mute and 
Blind Schools, approximating $1,000,000.

GEORGIA:   
M,. L., BRITTAIN, STATE SUPERINTENDENT. 
The figures for some years past show improvement in the 
school work of Georgia and the statistics for 1910, as compared 
with the year previous, also indicate progress. 
In 1909 the total enrollment of pupils was 547,912; for 1910 
we have 555,794. For 1909 the number of school houses built 
was reported as 320, with the total valuation of $467,891. For 
1910 the number is 301, at the cost of $512,641.20. The cost of 
the average house is, therefore, more and this is significant 
since the need is rather for larger and better than for more 
schools. The value of the common school property is reported

  $9,883,760.77, as against $8,603,853 for last year. The amount 
raised by local taxation during 1909 was $1,261,471.31; for 
1910 the figures show $1,307,136.65. Three entire counties 
voted for local tax during 1910 and 189 districts; 27 counties 
and 561 districts now supplement the State funds. For 1909, 
7,789 schools were reported with 12,231 teachers; for 1910 we 
have 7,946 schools and 12,625 teachers. The average monthly 
salary paid white male teachers in local systems for 1909 was 
$104.32; for 1910, $117.40; female teachers for 1909, $47.76; 
for 1910, $49.34. In the country schools the white male 
teachers received $58.34 and female teachers $37.48 in 1909; 
for 1910 this amount was increased to $59.56 for the white 
male teachers and $39.28 for females. The negro male teachers 
in local schools were paid upon an average in 1909, $49.53 
per month; female, $25.83. For 1910 in these same systems 
they were paid respectively $45.90 and $26.29. In the country 
schools the negro male teachers received $27.72, and female, 
$20.36. The total fund raised for common schools in 1909 was 
$4,229,254; for 1910 it is $4,606,410.88. 
The figures given above are presented with the hope of show 
ing something tangible in the way of work done in Georgia, 
although I realize fully the public appreciation of the old 
adage that lies are of three degrees, and the greatest of these, 
statistics. The truth is that these details give little idea of 
what we are most proud of in our State. The new laws passed 
by the General Assembly during last August furnish the real 
rainbow of promise in Georgia’s educational sky. After six 
years we have succeeded at least in securing important legisla- 
tion, which removes many of the cramped conditions under 
which we have labored for years past. Briefly, some of the main 
points of our successful educational bill are: The securing of 
a State Board of Education with increased power and com- 
posed of practical educators. The change in name from State 
and county commissioners to superintendents, with increase of 
salaries. Authority to consolidate schools and transport 
pupils. The appointment of an auditor to look after the ex- 
penditures of school funds. Three State supervisors for the 
training of teachers, and improvement in rural school condi- 
tions have also been provided. 
We have yet to obtain prompt payment for our teachers and

compulsory education, but we believe our State is in better 
condition than ever before to prepare the children of Georgia 
for the battle of life. 
KENTUCKY—ELLSWORTH REGENSTHIN, STATE SUPERINTENDENT. 
The most wholesome sign of educational progress in Ken- 
tucky is the sentiment of agitation throughout the State for 
better school conditions. Numerous organizations in the State 
are discussing and agitating various questions for the improve- 
ment of the schools. Numerous commercial bodies and other 
organizations are devoting much time and attention and are 
expending large sums of money to stimulate interest in the 
public schools. The people are becoming aroused, and in 
almost every county of the State are demanding additional 
legislation, additional taxes and improvement in various other 
ways. 
The amount of money for the current year for the public 
schools of the State has been greatly increased. The amount 
of per capita paid by the State has been increased from $4 to 
$4.40 per pupil, thereby adding an additional amount of over 
$300,000 to the school fund for the payment of teachers alone. 
The amount of local tax has also increased in almost every 
county in Kentucky, and I estimate an additional amount of 
local taxes for the current year of more than $250,000. 
Under the law enacted in 1908, providing for the establish- 
ment of one or more county high schools in every county of 
the State, we have seen the establishment of numerous county 
high schools during the current year. Many new high school 
buildings are being erected and equipped, while many other 
high schools erected prior to that date are being enlarged and 
improved. The people are becoming awakened to the impor- 
tance of first-class county schools in all counties of the State, 
and the improvement in this line is very marked. 
For the first time in the history of the State, we have caused 
to be conducted at the State Capitol an institute instructors’ 
convention. This convention met in May and was in session 
for three days. A number of the leading institute instructors 
of the State were present, an organization was formed, and 
much work was done toward the improvement of the various 
county institutes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
  326 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The instructors agreed upon uniform methods of instruction, 
and the work in this line has been greatly improved. 
With the assistance of the Southern Education Board and 
the General Education Board, a supervisor of rural schools, a 
supervisor of high schools and an assistant supervisor for 
colored schools have been appointed, and their work for the 
first year has been very effective. These officials have offices 
in the Department of Education at the State Capitol, and the 
results of their splendid work can be seen in almost every 
county in the State. The Southern Education Board has also 
provided for part payment of the salary and expenses of the 
School Improvement League organizer. This work has been 
carried on successfully for almost a year and a great good has 
been accomplished in the improvement and equipment of rural 
schools. 
The following important bulletins have been issued and 
widely distributed by this department: 
Examinations and Certificates.—This bulletin is devoted en- 
tirely to the question of examinations and certificates in Ken- 
tucky and codifies the entire law relating to this question. 
School Architecture.—This bulletin is devoted entirely to 
the question of building, equipping and beautifying the school 
buildings of the State. It gives plans and specifications for 
one, two, three and four-room school buildings, with numerous 
suggestions as to heating, lighting, sanitation and ventilation. 
Elementary Course of Study.—This is the largest and most 
complete course of study that has ever been prepared by the 
State. It has been placed in the hands of every teacher of 
an elementary school in Kentucky, and for the first year in 
the history of the State has been generally followed in the 
rural schools. 
Arbor and Bird Day Bulletin.—This bulletin is very large 
and most attractive. It has been distributed to every teacher 
in Kentucky, and the day was generally observed by all schools 
throughout the State. 
Public HealthtThis bulletin was prepared by the State 
Board of Health, but published by the Department of Educa- 
tion, and distributed to every teacher in Kentucky. It is one 
of the most important public documents that has ever been 
issued by any authority in the State relating to public health.
-P-A-G-E-327
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 327 
High School Course of Study.—A very elaborate course of 
study for city and county high schools has been prepared and 
distributed, giving suggestions as to equipment and operation. 
Under the direction of the Kentucky Educational Associa- 
tion, a legislative committee was appointed and has held 
numerous meetings during the current year. A very effective 
organization made, and sentiment created for new high school 
legislation by the State Legislature, which convenes on Jan- 
uary 1st. The conditions have been carefully studied, the 
school forces have been united, and great hope is entertained 
that the next Legislature will give us much wholesome legisla- 
tion for the improvement of all schools in the State. 
  LOUISIANA—T, H, HARRIS, STATE SUPERINTENDENT. 
The purpose of this report is to give an outline of the various 
lines of activity which have engaged the attention of the public 
schools during the last year, and a word concerning the prog- 
ress made in each of these fields of educational endeavor. In 
a report so brief it is necessary to omit much and to state 
without discussion the few facts that are given. 
Public School Sentiment.—The people of Louisiana are 
vitally interested in their public schools and never fail to 
respond when called upon to improve their educational facil- 
ities. School houses are being built where needed, the school 
term is being lengthened, and funds are being voted for 
teachers’ salaries, etc. All of these things the people do will- 
ingly. Very rarely does a man oppose any proposition which 
has for its object the improvement of the public schools. 
The Eelementary Schools—The elementary schools were 
open last session a little more than eight months throughout 
the State. Generally speaking, these schools were taught by 
competent teachers. In response to a resolution of the State 
Board of Education limiting the grades that should be taught 
in schools of one, two, three or four teachers, etc., many of 
the parishes limited their one-teacher schools to five grades, the 
‘wo-teacher schools to seven grades, the three-teacher schools 
to eight grades, etc., and made provision for assisting children 
needing instruction beyond that given by the school of their 
communities to attend the nearest school offering the instruc- 
tion required.

  828 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
There has been little or no increase in the number of high 
schools over that of the previous session. The State Board 
of Education has established high standards for its high 
schools in such matters as buildings, equipment, course of 
study, and teaching force. The aim has been to encourage 
schools to meet these standards, rather than to increase the 
number of schools. There are 190 State approved schools at 
‘this time, and about forty other schools are applying for 
-admission to the approved list. Each of the State approved 
high schools receives a special State appropriation of $500. 
Agriculture and industrial work: The General Assembly 
of 1910 appropriated $25,000 a year for the encouragement of 
agricultural schools; twenty-five schools have been established, 
representing all sections of the State. These schools are re- 
quired to have demonstration farms, trained teachers of agri- 
culture, and the tools and implements needed for the agricul- 
tural work. Several of them have domestic science depart- 
ments for the girls. Many other schools throughout the State 
thave added domestic science departments and employed 
teachers trained along this line, and these schools has in- 
stalled as much work as possible of this character. The parish 
of Bienville has introduced domestic science into fifteen of its 
schools and has employed a supervisor, who directs the do- 
mestic science work in all of the fifteen schools mentioned 
above. Several thousand boys were enrolled in the corn clubs 
last session and more than one thousand in the pig clubs. 
Canning clubs were also organized in various parts of the 
State for the purpose of instructing the girls in the preserva- 
tion of products that usually go to waste on the farm. These 
various industrial clubs had among the best exhibits at the 
State fair recently held in Shreveport. 
The State Board of Health has been operating a health car 
over all of the railroad lines of the State during the last year, 
giving lectures and demonstrations in the interest of public 
health. The State Department of Education kept a lecturer 
constantly with this car, with the view of impressing teachers, 
children and the public with the importance of thorough clean- 
liness and sanitation about the schools and in the homes. 
Many country schools were consolidated during the session 
1910-11. We have in the State more than 200 consolidated
-P-A-G-E-329
  
  JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGS. 329 
country schools and about 300 school transfers, which are used 
in transporting the children to these central institutions. Our 
people realize that the consolidated school does much more 
efficient work than the one-teacher school, and consolidations 
are being made wherever the condition of the roads, the dis- 
tance between schools, etc., will permit. 
The institute meetings and summer-school work have been 
highly satisfactory. The most of the parishes hold one-day 
institutes at the close of every school month and enroll in 
them the most of their teachers. A regular course of pro- 
fessional reading was pursued in these institutes. We held 
last summer five summer schools of nine weeks for the white 
teachers of the State, and two summer schools of six weeks for 
the colored teachers. About 65 per cent of the white teachers 
of the State and about 50 per cent of the colored teachers at- 
tended the summer schools. 
All of the State institutions are making satisfactory prog- 
ress: Practical all of them added new permanent buildings, 
had larger faculties, and increased attendance. The State 
Normal School is now establishing a rural school department, 
with the view of training teachers for country school work. 
The school census for 1911 gives 304,157 white children and 
222,111 colored children, making a total of 526,268 children 
in the State of school age. There were enrolled last session 
200,000 white children and 90,000 colored children, making a 
total of 290,000 children enrolled in the public schools. 
Many permanent brick buildings were erected in the towns 
and cities and many frame buildings in the country districts. 
The funds for this purpose were realized as a rule from special 
taxes which the people voted upon themselves. 
The school revenues last session amounted to $5,596,349.34 ; 
‘male white teachers were paid $74.21 a month, and white fe- 
male teachers $58.86 a month. 
Our parish superintendents are, generally speaking, well 
prepared for their work. The law requiring superintendents 
‘to pass an examination before they are eligible to hold the 
office of parish superintendent, makes it almost impossible 
for an incompetent man to be employed in that office. The 
average salary of our parish superintendents is $1,505.25 a 
syear.

The last Legislature passed ten laws bearing upon the public 
schools. They were all in the interest of progress. Four of 
the most important were (a) a law simplifying the machinery 
of holding special school tax elections and funding special 
taxes into bonds; (b) a law regulating institutes and summer 
schools; (c) a law regulating the adoption of text-books; and 
(d) a constitutional amendment requiring the police juries of 
all the parishes to appropriate as much as three mills of the 
parish’s taxes for public education. 
The following are assistants to the State Superintendent of 
Education: L. J. Alleman, State Institute Conductor; he has 
general supervision over the institutes and the summer schools. 
Mr. L. M. Favrot, the State High School Inspector; he super- 
vises the work in the State approved high schools and recom- 
mends new schools for approval. Mr. C. J. Brown, the Rural 
School Supervisor; his work is to assist communities in con- 
solidating their schools, in voting special taxes, and to en- 
courage them to introduce courses suited to the needs of coun- 
try communities. Mr. E. 8. Richardson, Supervisor of Agri- 
cultura] Schools; he has charge of the corn and pig clubs and 
supervises the work of the agricultural schools. Miss Agnes 
Morris lectures on sanitation and public health, generally, 
and has charge of the girls’ canning clubs. 
The above is a bare skeleton of the work of the public schools 
of last session, but it will serve to give some idea of our efforts 
in the interest of the children of the State. 
MARYLAND—M. BATES STEPHENS, STATE SUPERINTENDENT. 
It is gratifying to be able to say that the year has been a 
satisfactory one for the public schools of Maryland. Increased 
local interest evidenced by the activity of patrons’ clubs, neigh- 
borhood associations, corn clubs, and various other organiza- 
tions centering around the school; the marked increase in the 
amount of money raised locally for school purposes; the in- 
creased professional spirit indicated by enthusiasm at the 
teachers’ institutes and other meetings, as well as by the 
number of teachers who attended summer school during the 
last vacation, are all factors that seem to show a general move- 
ment in the right direction. 
Normal Schools.—The report of the principals of our normal 
schools show no material increase in the number of trained
-P-A-G-E-331
      
        JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 331 
teachers supplied through this medium. The supply is proba- 
bly less than one-fourth of the number needed annually. The 
trained teacher is now regarded as being as essential for the 
success of the modern public school as the pilot is for the ship 
that is plying in strange waters, yet our school boards are 
forced to employ each year several hundred persons as teachers 
who have had no special training for their work. Many of 
these either fail entirely, or do poor work for a number of 
years, to the great disadvantage of the pupils under their care. 
Normal education, though begun early in Maryland, has been 
much neglected in recent years by the State. We believe that 
the normal school should be made the one most important unit 
in our entire State system, an institution around which the 
whole system could proudly center, and whose influence could 
be felt in every fiber. Plans for a new plant are under way. 
Summer Schools.—The increased number of teachers from 
our State in attendance at the various universities, holding 
summer sessions, the summer work done in Garrett County, 
and especially the work of the teachers of Allegany County in 
session at Frostburg, are pleasing evidences of professional 
growth. The Johns Hopkins University, which should be a 
source of pride to every Marylander, embarked this year for 
the first time in summer-school work. We cannot overesti- 
mate what this means to the schools of Maryland. While a 
number of the teachers who attend the Hopkins may have gone 
elsewhere, we nevertheless feel assurd that it will attract many 
teachers who would have otherwise not attended summer 
schools at all. We believe that this enterprise will in the 
future become an important intergral part of our public school 
interests. 
High Schools.—High schools have made substantial prog- 
ress. Two additional ones have been placed on the “approved 
list,” and the total enrollment of students has increased 333, 
or about 9 per cent. There have been extensive additions of 
laboratory and other equipment, and these schools are more 
and more adjusting themselves to the real vocational needs of 
the great majority of students who attend them. ; 
Maryland Normal and Industrial School—The Maryland 
Normal and Industrial School, located at Jericho Park, in 
Prince George’s County, opened its doors for students for the
-P-A-G-E-332

  first time in September of this year. The institution now has 
enrolled as many students as it can properly accommodate, 
and if it achieves the success that the board should reasonably 
expect, it will in a measure solve some of the problems of 
future negro education. 
Compulsory Attendance.—Maryland seems to be one of the 
three or four remaining States that has not enacted a com- 
pulsory school attendance law. When we compare the number 
of children enrolled in the schools with the number of children 
of school age in the State, and note the low percentage of at- 
tendance in the majority of our counties, we are convinced that 
it is not because such a law is not needed in Maryland. The 
right of the State to guarantee at least an elementary educa- 
tion to every child within its borders is a principle accepted 
by all of the civilized nations of the globe. Neglect, poverty 
or greed on the part of the parent do not seem to furnish justi- 
fiable grounds, for depriving the child of this important heri- 
tage. 
School Statistics.—The statistical tables following show that 
the total amount expended for public school purposes has 
reached approximately the four and one-quarter million mark. 
There was an increase of $153,962.91 in the amount paid for 
teachers’ salaries in the counties, while the average salary 
moved upward from $367.52 in 1910 to $399.84 in 1911. There 
was a decrease in total enrollment of 1,274 pupils, 1,108 of 
which was in Baltimore city. The average number of pupils 
in daily attendance, though, decreased only 413. A decrease 
of twenty-eight in the total number of schools in the State can 
be accounted for by the progress being made in consolidation. 
In 1908 a proposed law fixing the minimum local levy for 
schools at 25 cents on each $100, which was about the average 
for the counties at that time, met with fatal opposition. Since 
that time, without being coerced, the average local levy has in- 
creased to 32 cents. Last year sixteen of the twenty-three 
counties levied more that 30 cents, four levied more than 40 
cents, while only two levied less than 20 cents for school pur- 
Does: MISSISSIPPI—(No Report.) > 
MISSOURI—WM. P. BVANS, STATH SUPERINTENDENT. 
The most conspicuous advancement in Missouri schools has 
been in some exceedingly high class legislation passed by the
-P-A-G-E-333
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 333 
Forty-sixth General Assembly in session January to March of 
this year. The principal laws passed are mentioned below, 
and some brief statements in regard to the causes leading to 
them and the results. 
One of the most far-reaching measures ever passed is the 
measure on certification of teachers by the county superin- 
tendent. This measure aims at the gradual raising of stand- 
ard on the part of candidates for county certificates, and will 
cause this preparation to so advance that in 1918 candidates 
for examination must have had four years high school prepara- 
tion, or its equivalent. Another change in the plan of issuing 
these certificates is that the papers of the higher grades of 
certificates will be graded in the State Department, and 
such others as the candidate chooses to have so graded. As 
this law has not yet gone into effect, it is too early to state 
just what the results will be, but it is confidently predicted that 
there will be a considerable weeding out of weak teachers, and 
as a result a much better standard of salary will come into 
effect. 
Another very important measure passed by the Legislature 
relates to the apportionment of the State school fund. This 
fund has become very large and now amounts to about one 
and three-quarter millions annually. The apportionment has 
heretofore been on the school census, including all between 
six and twenty years of age. The new plan provides that this 
money shall be apportioned on two bases: number of teachers 
employed and total average attendance. A certain apportion- 
ment will be given each school district for each teacher, and 
the balance of the fund, about one-half, will be apportioned on 
the total attendance of pupils in the various public schools of 
the district. In this way it is planned to have certain local 
effort in maintaining public schools recognized; also faithful 
attendance will be rewarded. Another feature that is to be 
commended is that those districts that tax themselves to main- 
tain high schools will receive apportionment for the full period 
of attendance in school, instead of being treated in the same 
manner as those districts that have slight interest in public 
schools and have short, weak courses. Reports from all quar- 
ters of the State are already showing greatly increased attend- 
ance and are pointing toward the effectiveness of the new 
 
-P-A-G-E-334

measure in enforcing the compulsory attendance law. Many 
people are willing to aid in the enforcement of the compulsory 
attendance law, when it results in a bonus for the district, who 
would hesitate to bring a penalty upon the violator. 
The Legislature also passed a law authorizing transporta- 
tion at the expense of the district. Laws had already been 
enacted permitting consolidation, but these laws were merely 
a dead letter owing to the fact that public money could not be 
used for transporting children to the school. The law was 
passed too late for districts to avail themselves of it this year. 
It is hoped, however, that many districts will consolidate and 
adopt means of transportation next year. There seems to be 
growing up in certain districts of the State a very strong sen- 
timent for consolidation. 
The law giving State aid to weak rural school districts was 
also improved, giving a larger number of districts opportunity 
to get the needed aid. This measure, however, is still only 
tentative, as the popular tendency in this State is at present 
toward equalizing school opportunities and enlarging the tax- 
ation unit. Illustrative of this tendency is another measure 
that narrowly missed enactment—State aid to weak high 
schools. The laws of this State have never taken special 
cognizance of the high schools, but here as everywhere the 
demand for this secondary training for the rural boys and girls 
is growing and measures of this sort cannot much longer be 
delayed. The State Teachers’ Association has also taken hold 
of this general proposition of enlarging the taxation unit, and 
has committed itself to trying to secure the passage of a con- 
stitutional amendment providing a “permanent education 
fund” by means of an additional tax, which, of course, will be 
State-wide and will furnish money that can be used in aiding 
and promoting educational advancement in the poorer dis- 
tricts of the State. When this movement is coupled with con- 
solidation and becomes widespread, the schools of the State 
will advance very rapidly and those in the weaker districts 
will draw much nearer to the advantages now offered in the 
town centers. 
It is proper to mention also that the Department of Educa-

schools, prepared largely by specialists with thorough prepara-

  tion. This is receiving a great deal of careful study and is 
widely commended for its many useful features. Among these 
features may be mentioned the scheme of alternation in the 
grades of the country schools, by means of which the teacher 
may have less grades each year. This scheme makes it possi- 
ble to reduce the necessary number of daily recitations to 
twenty-five or less. This is, of course, a very great reduction 
from the number necessary when all of the eight grades are 
taught each year. Another feature is that the work in these 
rural schools is based largely on suplementary reading, that 
the presence of supplementary reading in the classroom to fill 
out and enrich the instruction is taken for granted. Careful 
attention is paid to recommending the best available supple- 
mentary books for this purpose, and not too many are recom- 
mended. Another feature is a carefully selected list of library 
books for the rural schools. Many teachers are anxious to 
secure books and are unable to make selections, and such a 
list is essential to their wise use of the money put at their dis- 
posal for buying library books. 
The counties all chose county superintendents during this 
year, and so wisely was this choice executed that people in 
other States who are familiar with the county superintendents 
of this State are impressed with the strength of the people 
chosen to fill this exceedingly important position. County su- 
pervision has only existed two and one-half years in Missouri, 
and during this time rapid progress has been made in organiz- 
ing the work of the rural semi-rural schools. The county 
superintendents’ chief difficulties in the discharge of their 
work have been lack of sufficient numbers of well-prepared 
teachers, scarcity of money for the retention of the best quali- 
fied, and the pernicious custom that has grown up in the rural 
districts of frequent changes of teachers. It is thought that 
all of these difficulties will in part be removed and that these 
schools, on which more than half of the boys and girls of Mis- 
souri are attending, will soon move up to the standard set by 
the town schools. 
YEAR’S PROGRESS IN EDUCATION IN NORTH CAROLINA. 
During the year the regular annual county school tax for the 
maintenance of the elementary schools has been increased from 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
336 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  18 to 20 cents on the hundred dollars valuation of of property, 
making an increase of more than 11 per cent, that will yield 
a total increase of at least $350,000 in the annual elementary 
school fund this year. A corresponding increase was made 
during the year, by legislation, in the funds for the mainte- 
nance and improvement of the rural high schools, of the uni- 
versity, of the A. & M. colleges, of the State Normal and In- 
dustrial College, and other teacher-training schools. There 
are now 200 rural public high schools, in which are enrolled 
at least 7,000 boys and girls, and in ninety-one counties thou- 
sands now have a better chance for preparation for citizenship 
and life through high school instruction. 
By legislation and State appropriation, the way has been 
opened for the establishment of county farm-life schools for 
the preparation of country boys and girls for more profitable 
farming and more comfortable living on the farm: Two county 
farm-life schools have already been established this year. 
During the past decade one new, comfortable schoolhouse for 
every day in the year, Sundays included, has been built, and 
the people have kept up this splendid record in schoolhouse 
building during this year. Since 1900 the value of the school- 
houses and public school property of the State has been in- 
creased from $1,115,250 to $5,862,969, and the figures when com- 
puted will certainly show a proportionate increase for this 
year. : 
During the year 113 special rural school-tax districts have 
been established by vote of the people for lengthening the school 
terms and improving the schools, making a total of 1,280 such 
districts, in which is raised annually by special taxation, to: 
supplement the regular school funds available in those districts, 
more than one million dollars. Two hundred and eighty-three 
new rural libraries have been established, making a total of 
about three thousand. 
During the year teachers’ associations in ninety-two of 100 
counties have been actively and successfully working for the 
professional improvement of the rank and file of the teachers. 
More county fairs have been held this year than ever before in 
the history of the State. At most of these one day has been 
set apart as Educational Day, and among all the exhibits the 
living exhibit of thousands of school children in parade on that 
day attracted most attention and awakened most interest.

OKLAHOMA—R. H. WILSON, STATE SUPERINTENDENT. 
It is now a little more than four years since Oklahoma was 
admitted to the Union. In this short time two undeveloped 
territories have been merged into a prosperous commonwealth. 
The population and material resources of this new State have 
increased marvelously; churches and schools have kept pace 
with the multiplication of homes. An educational system with 
State and county supervision and a liberal provision for its 
support has been established, and the schools have grown rapidly 
in numbers and efficiency. 
Notwithstanding this gratifying growth, the school system in 
Oklahoma is yet in the formative period. It is now only one 
year since the beginning of the second State administration, but 
even in this brief period a number of important laws have been 
enacted and put into operation with a view to improving the 
system. 
Among those enactments may be mentioned a law providing 
for a centralized board of education. In addition to the usual 
duties conferred upon a State board, this board is empowered 
to act as a State text-book commission and as a board of regents 
for the State University, the six State normal schools, three 
industrial colleges, two preparatory schools and five eleemosy- 
nary institutions. The board also appoints a high school in- 
spector, whose duty it is to visit the high schools of the State 
and inspect the course of study, the character of instruction, 
and make such recommendations to the board as may result in 
a uniform course of study and a higher standard of affiliation 
with the State institutions. 
Another recent act of the Legislature provides that the State 
Superintendent shall appoint a common school inspector, whose 
duty it is to travel throughout the State and visit county super- 
intendents, and, with their counsel and assistance, inspect the 
conditions among the rural schools and to make such recom- 
mendations to the State Superintendent as the needs of the 
school may seem to demand. 
Another bill passed at the last session of the Legislature is 
worthy of mention. It provides for State aid for rural con- 
solidated schools from the proceeds of the rentals and sale of 
certain State lands. While this provision is not a large one, 
it is a step in the right direction, and has already given a very 
22  
-P-A-G-E-338
338 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
great impetus throughout the State to the plan of consolidating 
rural schools. 
Other laws are needed and some changes in existing laws 
would be welcomed. The board of education, the State Super- 
intendent, the high school inspector, the common school in- 
spector, and the county superintendents are working hand in 
hand to secure this needed legislation, and to place the school 
system of the State on a sound business and pedagogical basis. 
Some Sraristics.—Population of the State, 1,657,055; 
scholastic enumeration, 544,650; number of teachers in the 
State, 9,295; number of counties, 76; number of district 
schools, 5,820; number of consolidated schools, 86; number of 
high schools, 485; number of State institutions, 19; number of 
State normal schools, 6; number of private and denominational 
colleges, 12; State apportionment, $729,586.65; State expendi- 
tures, $6,739,215.67; total valuation of school property, 
$13,310,039.75. 
SOUTH CAROLINA—J. BE. SWEARINGEN, STATE SUPERINTENDENT. 
The educational work of the year has been eminently satis- 
factory. The enrollment and average attendance of pupils 
have been the largest in the history of the State. The liberal 
support of public education is shown by the fact that school 
receipts were the heaviest ever reported. During the year 
223 school districts either increased existing levies, or voted 
new levies for school purposes. 
The number and efficiency of the teaching force shows marked 
improvement. The summer school, held at Rock Hill in July, 
was one of the best in the experience of our most active edu- 
cators. The Legislature meets in January, and will doubtless 
continue its liberal policy towards high schools and other edu- 
eational institutions. 
  THNNESSEE—J. W. BRISTER, STATE SUPERINTENDENT. 
Perhaps the most significant evidence of educational progress 
during the past year in Tennessee has been the actual beginning 
of two State normal schools, one in the eastern section of the 
State, the other in Middle Tennessee. Both schools opened 
with a gratifying attendance, which has steadily and satisfac- 
torily increased. The normal school for West Tennessee is in 
process of construction, and will open with a summer session
-P-A-G-E-339
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 339 
in 1912. The Agricultural and Industrial Normal School for 
Negroes is also nearing completion, and will be ready for work 
next summer. ‘The schools now in operation are reasonably 
well equipped, and the others will be as generously cared for. 
Their course of study embraces not only the conventional sub- 
jects presented in normal schools, but domestic science, agricul- 
ture and kindred subjects will receive especial attention. A 
demonstration farm has been provided for each school, and the 
agricultural and related departments will be thoroughly 
organized. 
The high school situation in Tennessee is also encouraging. 
During the last two years, under the stimulus of State aid, 
about half of the counties in the State have voted special high 
school taxes. The county high schools enroll the best grad- 
uates of the elementary schools, and the type of work done is 
being constantly improved. The State Board of Education 
prescribes the qualifications of the high school teachers, thus 
enabling the counties to secure a competent teaching force. A 
number of the high schools are splendidly equipped with library 
and laboratory facilities, and a few are operating demonstration 
farms. There is a growing sentiment in favor of domestic 
science and agriculture, and these departments will soon find a 
place in all the schools. 
The elementary schools, it should’ be remarked, are showing 
improvement, especially in the matter of grading. A graded 
course of study, covering the eight grades of the elementary 
school, has been introduced into numerous schools in every 
county, always with beneficial results. A healthy library 
sentiment is in evidence in the schools. The State makes a 
small appropriation to supplement local funds, and during the 
last two years nearly 900 small libraries have been established 
in as many rural schools in the State. 
The movement for consolidated schools is well under way in 
Tennessee. It was inaugurated years ago, and has had some 
good results. But there are still too many one-room schools 
for an efficient system, and many of them are being abandoned 
for larger and better schools, which promise more effective 
response to the new demands being made upon the rural school. 
Improved rural conditions, especially in the matter of good 
roads, are favorable to this movement, and thus the consolidated

school is becoming practicable, as well as desirable and neces- 
sary. A few counties have adopted transportation with consol- 
idation with satisfactory results, and the disposition to follow 
the example is noticeable in every part of the State. 
Of the 96 counties in Tennessee, 22 levy local taxes for the 
elementary schools in excess of 40 cents; 63 have a 40-cent tax 
rate, and the other 11 average about 30 cents. In addition to 
this, about 50 counties have local high school tax rates varying 
from five to fifteen cents. It is generally known that the State 
supplements these local taxes by appropriating 25 per cent of 
its gross revenue to school purposes. It is realized, however, 
that the present school revenues are inadequate for present 
needs, and the sentiment is strong for increased local taxes as 
well as a raise in the State’s appropriation from 25 to 334 per 
cent. 
Definite statistics as to the present educational situation in 
Tennessee are not available, because of the delay in getting out 
the Annual Report, and for that reason it has been necessary to 
confine the statement to general remarks. 
TEXAS—T. H. SHELBY. 
There has been a feeling among the educational leaders of 
Texas for some years that this State has not made as good 
progress as she should have done, in view of the large permanent 
school fund which was provided by the early fathers of Texas. 
Texas has the largest permanent school fund of any State in 
the American Union, and doubtless of any State in the world. 
This fund aggregates at the present time something more than 
seventy millions of dollars. In many communities small politi- 
cians and other Fourth-of-July orators have vied with each 
other in their praise of the wonderful school system which 
Texas had, and as an indication of this have pointed to the 
great and magnificent permanent school fund. In many in- 
stances this has resulted in a sort of feeling on the part of the 
local communities that our patriotic forefathers have made 
ample provisions for the children of this and future generations, 
and have made no effort to supplement the income from the 
permanent fund and the State tax by local taxation. The 
result of this is that Texas has not only fallen far below her 
own possibilities educationally, but finds herself actually behind

       JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 341 
       
                                          
          
      
                                              a great many other States in the Union very much less favored 
by natural resources, and certainly not so fortunate in this 
permanent income. In recent years educators and other patri- 
otic citizens have not hesitated to proclaim our shortcomings, 
and have unhesitatingly declared that something must be done 
to improve the school conditions of this State. As a result of 
this agitation, and through the efforts of the Conference for 
Education in Texas, in coéperation with the educational leaders 
and the other worthy organizations of various kinds, there has 
been an educational uplift, which finds expression along several 
distinct and important lines. 
Texas has made commendable progress in the financial sup- 
por of her public schools. The State apportionment of available 
school funds is the largest in the history of the State—$6.80 
per capita. The number of the nearly 8,000 common school 
districts which levy a local tax has increased from 40 per cent 
to 50 per cent during the year. There are 680 independent 
school districts and cities and towns which have assumed 
control of their schools, 96 per cent of which levy a local tax 
for maintenance, for bonds, or for both. The amount per 
capita spent for maintaining the schools for the entire State 
increased from $10 to $13 during the last year. During the 
year 1909-10, the last year for which we have complete reports, 
bonds were sold by the various school districts and cities for 
the erection of schoolhouses to the total amount of $2,793,858. 
This represents an increase of almost 100 per cent over the 
amount of the bonds issued in the year 1908-09. This remark- 
able development in local school tax for maintenance and for 
building and equipment is the result of the constitutional 
amendment adopted in 1909, by which the two-thirds-vote rule 
was displaced by majority-vote rule in all common school and 
independent school district school-tax elections, and the local 
tax limit increased from 20 cents to 50 cents on the $100 of 
property valuation. 
The greatest progress to be noted in Texas has been the ad- 
vancement in school sentiment and school ideals. An aroused 
public sentiment in favor of sane and evolutionary school im- 
provement as expressed in the resolutions and proceedings of 
the various teachers’ associations, the Conference for Education 
in Texas, the Farmers’ Congress, the Women’s Federated Clubs,
-P-A-G-E-342
   
      342 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
the Press Association, and various other progressive and worthy 
organizations, and as pronounced from the platform by leading 
educators and other public-spirited and patriotic citizens, has 
been crystalized into some legislative enactments of far-reach- 
ing importance. 
The most important factor in any school or system of schools 
is the teacher. Thousands, or even millions, of dollars may be 
expended for the most modern schoolhouses to little avail. The 
most up-to-date school furniture and other equipment; the best 
sanitary conditions; the best equipped laboratories and libra- 
ries; the latest and most approved course of study as to both 
subject-matter and arrangement—all these will avail little if 
you have a bungler or a novice to face the pupils in the school- 
room. The Legislature of Texas enacted at its last session a 
certificate law, which will compare favorably with any similar 
law in any State in the Union. Under this law all certificates, 
except a second-grade county certificate and certain classes of 
city certificates, are issued by the State Superintendent of 
Public Instruction. The law substituted an easy method of 
building from a lower grade State certificate for the extension 
features of the old law. Under the new law the holder of a 
second-grade State certificate may build to a first-grade State 
or a permanent primary certificate by taking the examination 
in the prescribed additional subjects at any time during the 
life of his lower grade, the applicant having the privilege of 
being examined in one or more subjects at any one examina- 
tion. The holder of a first-grade State certificate my build to 
a permanent primary or a permanent certificate in the same 
manner. This law gives opportunity to teachers to do some 
really intensive work upon a few subjects, and eliminates the 
craming process with its attendant evils. Results, an in- 
creased interest in professional advancement are already evi- 
dent, and a general raising of the standard of scholarship, 
academic and professional, is inevitable. 
In the recent session of the Legislature the State normal 
schools for the training of white teachers were taken out of the 
hands of the State Board of Education, an ex-officio board, and 
placed in charge of a Normal School Board of Regents, of 
which the State Superintendent of Public Instruction is ea- 
officio chairman. It is confidently expected that efficiency of 
the schools in preparing teachers will be increased very much.    
    
 
-P-A-G-E-343
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 343, 
It has been noted by our leading educators that one of the 
great weaknesses of our public schools is the lack of the proper 
classification and graduation, and lack of organization of the 
work, and the lack of high school advantages within reach of 
the thousands of boys and girls who reside in rural communi- 
ties. The rural high school law as enacted by the Legislature 
at its recent session provides for a county board of school 
trustees composed of five members, elected by the county at 
large. It provides that this county board of education shall 
classify the schools of the common school districts of the county 
into primary schools, intermediate schools, and high schools, 
and give authority to this board, in codperation with the 
county superintendent, and in conformity to the rules and 
regulations of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
to prescribe a course of study for all of the schools of the 
county.. The law also gives authority to the county board, in 
codperation with the local trustees, to consolidate two or more 
common-school districts for the purpose of establishing a rural 
high school. In consolidating these districts, the law makes 
it the duty of the board to give due regard to schools already 
in existence. If in the consolidated district there are two or 
more schools already in existence, the board may classify these 
schools as primary schools or intermediate schools of so many 
grades, and may limit the instruction in these schools to the 
classification given. It may then at some central point, pos- 
sibly at one of the schools already established, make provision 
for all of the pupils of high school advancement residing in 
the consolidated district. The law further provides that the 
county board of education may negotiate with the trustees in 
districts in which high schools are maintained for the free 
_ tuition of eligible high school pupils residing in adjacent or 
convenient common-school districts not maintaining high 
schools, and gives authority to the board to transfer an equita- 
ble sum of the State and county and local tax fund of the dis- 
trict from which the transfer is made to the district in which 
the high school is maintained. The transportation of pupils. 
who reside at a great distance from the school is made possible 
and practicable under this law. 
The law makes it the duty of the State Superintendent of 
Public instruction to classify the high schools in common-
-P-A-G-E-344
344 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
school districts who desire such classification into high schools 
of the first class, of the second class, or of the third class, and 
prescribes the minimum requirements for high schools of each 
class. The authority of the State Superintendent under the 
law makes it possible for that official to define what shall be 
considered a primary school, what an intermediate school, and 
what a high school, of the third class, of the second class, or 
of the first class. A course of study has been issued by the 
State Department of Education defining these various classes 
of schools, and indicating the work in the various subjects to 
be done in each grade of each class of schools. This course of 
study, while not compulsory, except in an indirect way, has 
been adopted by the trustees of a majority of the counties of 
the State. 
The rural high school law carries with it an appropriation 
of $50,000 per year for each of the years ending August 31, 
1912, and August 31, 1913, to high schools classified and ac- 
credited by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction for 
the establishment of departments of agriculture, manual train- 
ing and domestic economy. The State Board of Education is 
vested with the authority of disbursing this fund to the va- 
rious districts, on condition that the districts meet all the re- 
quirements of the law and the regulations of the State Super- 
intendent of Public Instruction, and that they further set aside 
an amount equal to the amount appropriated by the State 
Board of Education. In this conection the law indicates the 
minimum and maximum amounts that may be received by any 
school for any one year, and also for the two years. In many 
counties in the State work has already begun under authority 
of this law. 
The classification of the schools and the prescribing of the 
course of study has consumed the time and attention of most 
of the county trustees thus far. Definite ideas among the 
county and local trustees, and the people generally, are begin- 
ning to crystalize concerning the meaning of classification 
and gradation and the importance of these things in accom 
plishing definite results in school work. The provision of the 
certificate law that a teacher to be eligible to teach in a high 
school must hold a first-grade teacher’s certificate or certificate 
of higher rank, has a tendency to cause local trustees in em- 
 
-P-A-G-E-345
JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 345 
ploying teachers to make a sharp discrimination between 
teachers holding various grades of certificates, and will in- 
evitably result in an effort on their part to employ teachers 
holding the highest grade of certificate. 
In many instances consolidation has been effected, and 
something more than twenty rural high schools have met the 
requirements and have received State aid in the establishment 
of one or more of the departments of agriculture, manual train- 
ing and domestic economy. 
Through the work of the Extension Department of the Uni- 
versity of Texas and the Conference for Education in Texas, a 
sentiment in favor of modern school buildings, sanitary in 
every respect, equipped with the most approved furniture and 
fixtures, is growing in many sections of the State, so that much 
of the money spent on school buildings, as indicated in the 
earlier part of this report, has gone into buildings and equip- 
ment such as are approved by the best authorities. 
An effort has been made by means of the course of study 
issued by the State Department of Education, and through the 
codperation of the county superintendents, to adjust the cur- 
ricula of these rural schools, and especially of the consolidated 
high schools, to the needs of the various communities. The 
industrial branches are receiving special consideration. Since 
Texas is largely an agricultural State, this subject is receiv- 
ing large attention, both from a theoretical and a practical 
standpoint. 
It is hoped that the high schools established will become 
centers for the social activities of the community, and for the 
formation of clubs and society which will reach and vitally 
affect for good the young people of the community who are 
beyond school age, and the parents of the children in the 
school, and the older persons of the community in general. To 
this end we are encouraging the formation of corn clubs, poul- 
try clubs, debating clubs, societies for the study of literature. 
home economics clubs, etc., in connection with the school. The 
aim in all this being to relate the school as much as possible 
to the community life and to make it a vital force, not only in 
the proper training of the young, but in giving information to 
the older persons of the community that will be of great 
benefit to them in their every-day life.

VIRGINIA—J. D. EGGLESTON, STATE SUPHRINTENDENT. 
Educational progress in Virginia during the year 1911 was 
notably evident along many lines. Without special effort or 
the slightest evidence of a campaign, local school revenues 
were increased nearly $700,000, more high schools were opened, 
in building operations the high-water mark of $1,000,000 per 
annum was almost reached, and the movement to secure graded 
and consolidated schools was successful to such an extent that 
nearly half of the country schoolrooms in the State are in 
schools having more than one teacher. The total enrollment 
of the public schools was 409,491, and 16,442 were enrolled in 
high schools. Ten thousand five hundred teachers were em- 
ployed and the average length of session for the entire State 
was 140 days. Our average salaries are $47.59 per month for 
males and $36.02 for females, as compared with $36.86 for 
males and $28.11 for females five years ago. White male 
teachers averaged $52.22 per month, and white female teachers, 
$37.03. The salaries of teachers aggregated $2,950,000. 
Virginia has 432 high schools, an increase of 358 in five years. 
The Department of Public Instruction is engaged in perfecting 
the practical details of administration in these schools, and is 
more anxious to bring all of the schools up to a high standard 
than to establish new ones. 
The normal training departments in high schools, twenty- 
five in number, were visited during the year by an officer spe- 
cially appointed for that purpose. The results found expres- 
sion in a new and definite course of study, which has put new 
life into the normal ‘training work, now measured and de- 
scribed in definite terms of high school units. The teachers 
are enthusiastic and the coming year will probably see a large 
increase in the number of such departments. 
Industrial work in our cities and demonstration work in the 
country have made great strides forward, thus bringing the 
school in touch with many phases of actual life not hitherto 
affected in any direct and vital way by the school. The corn 
and domestic science clubs are part and parcel of our rural 
school work, and the simple facts of agriculture are taught in 
an ever-increasing circle of elementary schools. 
The increase in the number of consolidated schools has been 
most gratifying, and the substantial nature of the new founda-
-P-A-G-E-347

tions thus laid is indicated actually on the physical side, and 
emblematically on the mental and moral side, by the heavy 
outlay for new and commodious buildings. Two hundred and 
forty-seven new schoolhouses were erected at a total cost of 
$837,338.32. One hundred and ninety-nine wagons were em- 
ployed in the transportation of pupils. 
During the year the State Board of Education has discon- 
tinued the State Board of Examiners and Inspectors and trans- 
ferred their duties to the Department of Public Instruction. 
This does not mean a return to the county system of examin- 
ing teachers, nor any abatement in our efforts to inspect 
schools; it simply means the closer organization of codrdina- 
tion of the work for the sake of promoting efficiency. 
WEST VIRGINIA—M. P. SHAWKEY, STATE SUPERINTENDENT. 
Educational progress in West Virginia has been steady and 
continuous for a number of years. It has been and is more on 
the nature of an evolution than a revolution. While events 
educational are occurring in more rapid succession at the pres- 
ent time than heretofore, there is nothing of the nature of ex- 
citement in connection therewith. Our chief difficulty has 
been in overcoming the inertia of the common mind; in other 
words, to arouse the proper interest on the part of the people 
at large in the education of their children and in the work of 
the schools. Fortunately the organization of the school sys- 
tem in West Virginia is such as to make it practical to under- 
take to arouse public sentiment on a broad scale, and that has 
been done. While we have succeeded in working out valuable 
courses of study, and in securing important legislation of va- 
rious kinds, and in having the levying bodies and the Legisla- 
ture provide liberal sums of money for all of our educational 
institutions, in my judgment the most valuable asset we have 
educationally is the aroused and intelligent public sentiment 
in favor of education, and especially in favor of improved 
methods and more vitalized schools. 
Schoolhouses.—During the last school year we built 148 
schoolhouses of various kinds, or a little less than three to 
each county. About two-thirds of these were added to our 
former supply and the other one-third is to displace worn-out 
or disused buildings. A large percentage of these houses were

  single-room country schools, the average cost of which was a 
little less than $1,000. There has been, however, an unusually 
large number of high schools and town buildings erected dur- 
ing this time. i 
Public School Libraries.—We have in our State a law au- 
thorizing the boards of education to appropriate as much as 
$10 per schoolroom each year for library books. We consider 
this a good law, but before we had this law our teachers and 
patrons interested themselves in school libraries, and began 
establishing them by voluntary effort and contributions. We 
believe that this custom, which has prospered in a marked de- 
gree, is even better than our law. We have therefore paid 
little attention to the law, but have encouraged the establish- 
ment of libraries in every school, and I find by examining the 
county report that we added last year 25,117 volumes, making 
a total of 285,939 volumes in the school libraries of the State. 
December 8th is Library Day, for which we have issued and 
distributed a very attractive program, and from which we ex- 
pect to realize great results in the aggregate. While we had 
but 635 libraries ten years ago, with a total of 30,679 volumes, 
we now have 3,680 libraries, with a total of 285,939 volumes. 
In one county every one of the 112 schools, nearly all of which 
are single-room buildings, has a library, and it is believed that 
within the next two years 90 per cent of the schools of the 
State will be thus supplied, and, as I have remarked, prac- 
tically all of them without an appropriation of public funds. 
Clean-Up and Beautify Day.—For several years we have 
been stressing the importance of clean and attractive school 
premises. For the purpose of giving this line of education 
definiteness and direction, we have designated the first Friday 
in October as Clean-Up and Beautify Day, and have provided 
some kind of literature each year to arouse an intelligent in- 
terest in that work. This year we issued a score card, by 
which each teacher can easily grade the standing of his school 
as to physical conditions inside and out. This card is ar- 
ranged in such a shape that it may be hung on the wall, and 
the record changed like a thermometer as the condition of the 
school grows better or worse. This little device proved ex- 
eeedingly serviceable, not only in arousing interest, but in 
giving proper direction to the resultant activities.

School Attendance.—There are many things in connection 
with school work that are more spectacular, more interesting 
and more attractive than the persistent effort required to 
secure and maintain a high percentage of attendance on a 
broad scale throughout all the schools of a State under all 
conditions. We feel, however, that our schools lose much in 
efficiency, as well as waste much in the lost expenditure and 
loss of opportunity, by the low percentage of attendance and 
the irregularities in attendance. To help remedy this a cru- 
sade was inaugurated, which was carried on first through 
the State Educational Association, then through the county 
institute and the school journals, and finally through the big- 
gest device that was ever made up as an aid in common school 
work. It was announced at the beginning of last year that 
an honor roll book would be published, including the name, 
age and address of every boy and every girl in the State who 
made a perfect attendance record. As a result nearly 20,000 
children’s names were reported and a book of 280 pages was 
issued, a copy of which was supplied to every school and 
family whose children had made a perfect record. This proved 
a wonderful stimulus to the interest in school attendance, and 
upon the request of hundreds and thousands of children, 
teachers and patrons the book is to be reissued for the present 
year. I may say that the figures, while yet imperfect, show 
a material gain in school attendance. With the gain in school 
attendance has come about the natural intensity of school 
interest, one of the ends so much desired. 
Reinforcement of Single-Room Schools.—Statistics show that 
in the United States, even as in West Virginia, every fourth 
teacher every year is a beginner. In West Virginia about 
three-fourths of all our teachers are employed in single-room 
country schools. A large percentage of these beginning teach- 
ers are not more than seventeen years of age, with no profes- 
sional training. Such a teacher in an isolated country school, 
where educational interest is at its lowest ebb, under conditions 
as they have existed all these years, presents a pretty cold and 
hopeless picture. If there is any teacher anywhere who needs 
the warmth of close contact with associates in the work, the 
counsel of wise friends and the support of an efficient super- 
visor, it is the young, inexperienced, isolated, country teacher. 
   
-P-A-G-E-350
  350 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
To improve this condition we have not only provided literature 
and organized local reading circles and institutes, but we have 
also made optional provision for district supervisors. For lack 
of funds and want of trained supervisors, this system could not 
be introduced generally at once. We have, however, at present 
thirty-eight of these district supervisors at work, and that 
number will materially increase in the immediate future. We 
have also done something along the line of consolidation. 
There are now twenty distinct cases of consolidation in the 
State. Eight wagons are being used, and the trolley and steam 
railroad have been called into service in several other cases, 
in addition to those where consolidation has been practical 
without providing for transportation. At Gary and elsewhere 
plans for consolidation and transportation on a large scale 
are on foot. 
Medical Inspection and Child Labor.—This year for the 
first time we have a new law throwing greater safeguards 
around the schools and the children with respect to employ- 
ment. This law in the first place prohibits the employment 
of children under fourteen in any kind of a factory, mill or 
workshop, and the same prohibition applies to all children 
under sixteen years of age while the schools are in session. 
We also have a law providing for medical inspection of the 
children of the public schools throughout the State. This 
law makes the appointment of a medical inspector obligatory 
in the towns and cities, and has an optional provision for 
magisterial districts. This law is bringing about unmeasured 
good to the State. 
High Schools.—During the past year we have established 
twenty-five high schools, being an increase of almost 30 per 
cent on the number of such schools within the State. During 
the school year which closed the 30th of last June, our reports 
show an increase of 980 high school pupils, making a total 
attendance of 5,880. Reports for the present school term are 
not complete, but we have sufficient information to indicate 
that there will be at least 30 per cent increase in high school 
attendance again this year. We find also that 43 per cent 
of our high school teachers are graduates of a reputable college, 
and practically all of the rest of them are graduates of State 
normal schools or institutions offering equivalent courses. For
-P-A-G-E-351
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 351 
the first time this year the State Department of Schools has 
authority to classify the high schools of the State, and that has 
been done, putting them upon a standard basis. A number of 
the so-called high schools have not been included in the figures 
which I have given. For the first time also the State has made 
an appropriation for the support of high schools, which is 
apportioned according to the grade of work they do. 
School Hapenditures.—In West Virginia 85 per cent of the 
revenues for the public school system is raised by local taxa- 
tion. These levies are laid by the authority of the people 
expressed by the ballot. For the present year we are raising 
about five million dollars, or four dollars per capita on every 
man, woman and child in the State. While I believe we have 
the reputation of raising the largest amount of money for 
schools by local taxation of any State south of Mason and 
Dixon’s line, and larger than the average State either North 
or East, yet the amount raised would have been increased by 
the voluntary efforts of the people this year had it not been 
for our law, which places a maximum limit upon the amount 
of levies that may be laid for such purposes. As an indication 
of the growth in school interest and expenditures, I beg to cite 
the fact that in 1900 the total amount of school money raised 
by the State of West Virginia was $2,019,165, and in 1910 this 
amount had increased to $4,542,611, showing an increase in 
ten years of 125 per cent. For the year just closed our figures 
show we spent $5,200,000. 
Miscellaneous.—Other items indicating some degree of prog: 
ress are rather too numerous to enumerate. I am particularly 
gratified, however, at the growing tendency among individual 
teachers who experiment on plans that seem worth while, and 
reach out for the best that may be had for themselves and their 
schools. In four or five instances men teachers in single-room 
schools have added the work bench or a complete work shop, 
with tools, to their equipment and are doing something through 
this process to intensify interest in school work and correlate 
it with the actual life of the community. Nearly all of our 
leading high schools are now taking up manual training and 
domestic science. Agriculture in some form is taught in every 
public school of the State. The work of teachers’ reading 
circles has greatly increased and every year shows a larger

number of graduates from the normal schools taking their 
place in the ranks of the teaching profession. The secondary 
and higher educational institutions all report a better prepared 
class of entering students, and the demands for more thorough- 
ly trained teachers is insistent throughout the State. Atten- 
tion has been given to the weaker places in our educational 
system, with the result that the larger and higher elements of 
the system have a stronger base upon which to build. We are 
yet a long way from ideal conditions, but there is some satis- 
faction in knowing that a reasonable opportunity is offered 
every child in the State for acquiring a good, thorough, general 
or special education without great expense and without the 
necessity of going away from his own home.

THE PROPER BASIS FOR THE PROMOTION OF TEACH- 
ERS AND INCREASE OF SALARY. 
THOS, L. TOLAND, WICHITA FALLS, TEXAS. 
This is a subject that is very near the hearts of both the 
supervisor and the supervised. It has been discussed far and 
wide in teachers’ gatherings, and in many instances by the 
leading educators and thinkers of modern times, but, like many 
of our school problems, no equitable basis or plan has been 
devised that will solve, for all, the problems of promotion and 
increase of salaries. The problems of a proper basis for the 
promotion and increase of salaries are closely related, and a 
correct solution of the one will aid materially and intelligently 
in the right solution of the other. 
I presume in this discussion the promotion of teachers means 
the advance to places of higher trust and greater authority; 
places where a higher degree of responsibility exist, positions 
that require a marked degree of executive ability and insight 
above that required for the proper direction and management 
 
-P-A-G-E-355
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 355 
of a grade or single class-room. For example, in the high 
school, to the head of a department, assistant principal or 
principal itself; in the elementary school, to principal, assist- 
ant principal, or supervisor of some special subject. 
I do not think it advisable to make it appear to elementary 
teachers that it is a promotion to be changed from a lower 
to a higher grade in that department, as, for example, from 
the second to the fifth grade. Elementary teachers should 
rather be encouraged to select and make a thorough prepara- 
tion for a certain grade of work, or a certain subject, in schools 
where departmental work is done in the elementary school. 
As long as superintendents and principals hold out the idea to 
their teachers that it is a promotion to be changed from the 
third to the sixth grade, teachers in the lower elementary 
school will not stay long enough in that work to become effi- 
cient, if it is possible for them to secure the so-called promo- 
tion. 
I see no good reason for school men and school authorities 
to make it appear to teachers that it is more honorable, and 
that it requires higher grade teachers for the upper elementary 
school than for the lower grades. In fact, if there is any 
difference, it requires greater skill and ability to make a suc- 
cess in the lower grades than in the upper elementary grades. 
In speaking of the elementary school, I refer to all grades 
below the high school. 
I am of the opinion that it would, to a great extent, over- 
come this false idea of promotion, which exists among teachers, 
if we would cease using the useless terms primary, inter- 
mediate and grammar school, and refer to the work below the 
high school as the elementary school. 
There are many essential qualities which the teacher who 
is being considered for promotion should possess. I shall in 
the time allotted me be able to discuss only a few of the most 
vital ones, as I see it. 
One of the most important of these is scholarship. It is true, 
especially in the high school, that this quality is largely taken 
care of in the employment of teachers; as, it is generally con- 
ceded by our best school men that a high school teacher should 
have, at least a university degree. I am of the opinion that 
training above a mere college or university degree should be
-P-A-G-E-356
356 SOUTHHRN HDUOATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
required of high school teachers of special subjects, as it is 
possible to do very limited special work on a subject while 
taking a bachelor degree. Therefore, it would be desirable for 
a teacher of a special subject in our high schools to have taken 
a postgraduate course in that subject. If they have done this, 
and continue to study and prepare as they have opportunity, 
then the scholarship requirement for promotion to heads of 
departments and principalships is to a great extent fulfilled. 
However, academic training is not sufficient in itself, but pro- 
fessional training must be considered. Certainly a teacher 
should not be promoted to a higher position of trust in our 
school systems who is not sound pedagogically, who is not 
a firm believer in professional education and training for 
teaching as in other professions, such as law, theology and 
medicine. Furthermore, it is not enough to be a believer, but 
those who aspire to higher positions in our school systems must 
be students of the history and science of education. 
What I have said about professional training in reference 
to high school teachers will apply also to elementary teachers. 
As to scholarship, it is important that elementary teachers 
have at least a normal school education; and it is very desir- 
able that they have both college and normal school training. 
While there are many most excellent teachers in elementary 
schools who have only high school training, they should not 
be seriously considered for principals and supervisors; for the 
reason, that teachers of limited scholarship do not possess the 
high educational ideals required for successfully leading and 
directing other teachers to the best in education. 
Again, the attitude of a teacher toward those above him in 
authority should be carefully considered for promotion. Those 
who would lead others must first learn the important lesson of 
loyalty to their superiors in authority. Is he loyal to the 
board of education, to the superintendent, to the principal, and 
to all interests of the schools? Is he willing to sacrifice his 
opinions, not principles, and follow the instructions of his 
superiors in authority? Has he learned well to whom to go 
with his school problems, and be sure that he will receive the 
correct advice and help? The authority vested in the board of 
education by the public school laws, and the choice of the 
people, make it right that their employees should respect them 
 
-P-A-G-E-357
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 357 
and carefully follow their instructions, not because of their 
personal rights, but because of their legal rights, and their 
position. The superintendent, the legal executive officer of the 
board of education, is entitled, on account of his position and 
relationships to the schools, to the loyal coéperation and sup- 
port of his teachers in executing the instructions of the board 
of education. The principal, the teacher’s immediate profes- 
sional superior, made so by his position in the system, to whom 
the teacher should turn with the problems concerning his 
room and classes, should have the loyal support and help of the 
teacher. 
It requires but little professional insight, it seems, for a 
teacher to comprehend these relationships; but often they be- 
come so confused or misled that they confide their troubles 
first, perhaps, to other teachers, then to anyone that they may 
chance to meet; thus, by so doing, they advertise their own 
troubles and embarrassment. In my opinion, the teacher who 
so far fails to comprehend the proper school relationships, will 
have an undesirable career in whatever position he attempts 
to fill. The superintendent or principal who has recommended 
the teacher, and made him secure in his position, is his best 
friend and should be consulted first of all. These relation- 
ships are so important that the teacher who cannot understand 
and appreciate them, or the teacher who willfully neglects 
them, should not be considered for promotion to places of 
greater responsibility. 
Other essential qualities are real love for the work; an 
abiding faith in the possibilities of education; an interesting 
current pedagogical literature; an appreciation of the benefits 
of teachers’ gatherings, such as grade meetings, institutes, and 
State and national associations for the study and discussion of 
educational problems; ability and willingness to do the things 
not required by rules and regulations of the boards of educa- 
tions; a pleasing personality and an optimistic view of child 
life; resourcefulness, tact and skill in meeting difficult situa- 
tions, and in preventing such situations from arising. - 
The promotions that I have mentioned naturally carry with 
them increase of salary, as well as greater responsibility. 
In the minds of many the salary phase of my subject is 
more important; but, as in promotion, I am persuaded, after 
 
-P-A-G-E-358
358 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION, 
  careful study of the question, that merit is the reasonable and 
proper basis for advance in teachers’ salaries. However, I 
understand that conditions often obtain which make it almost 
impossible to place increase of salaries on merit alone. There 
are other questions which must be considered, but after the 
proper minimum basis has been equitably fixed for salaries in 
the different departments of the school system, and the mini- 
mum qualifications of teachers for the different departments 
fixed, I see no good reason for using in the main any other 
except the merit system in promotion and increasing teachers’ 
salaries. 
My subject, as I understand it, assumes that it is not a 
matter of raising funds, but of raising salaries on the proper 
basis after the funds have been provided, and I am very glad 
of this. While we have not as yet found a strictly scientific 
basis for increasing salaries, I had rather undertake to evolve 
such a basis out of the chaotic theories and discussions offered 
in the past, together with my own experience, than give a prac- 
tical basis for raising the funds necessary to meet the increase 
after the proper basis has been determined. For the people 
have been slow in meeting the just demands of the children 
of this great nation for more efficient and better paid teachers. 
The best way to approach the majority of teachers is to 
arouse an interest in the increase of salaries. This is a certain 
basis upon which to get their attention, and many designing 
people have learned to approach them in this way. They are 
told that the board of education is against them, and often 
caused to join a crusade against the board, with the hope of 
getting concessions along the salary line. In some instances 
they have formed organizations, and allied themselves with 
trades and labor unions, in their effort to obtain increase 
of salary. I believe in the right of teachers to organize for 
their improvement, as a class; but I regard it as a fatal mis- 
take for teachers to ally themselves with any union in order 
to secure increase of salaries and other desired concessions. 
They should remember that -they serve all classes of people, 
and as a matter of public policy and propriety should refrain 
from an alliance with any special class of citizens. They are 
not employed to teach the children of any particular class, 
but of all classes. I do not question the right of the organiza-
-P-A-G-E-359
      
        JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 359 
tion of labor, or of public school teachers forming associations 
for mutual benefit and improvement along educational lines. 
It is very true that good teachers do not always get what 
they merit, but the main reason for this is that they are al- 
ready classed with time servers in the minds of many good 
people, which is a very unfortunate classification for them. 
So there is no good reason why they should further burden 
themselves, and jeopardize their chances for promotion and 
better salaries, by more closely relating themselves with the 
time servers in the profession. 
It is generally conceded that the income of good teachers 
is too small. I believe that the crusade for higher minimum 
salaries for the teachers of our public graded schools should be 
urged by every parent who is interested in the welfare of his 
child, because better salaries mean better talent, better prepara- 
tion, a higher character of work, and the ability to take advan- 
tage of greater opportunities for improvement on the part of 
the teachers. 
Some think that the earning power should be taken into 
account more than it is at present; that often the teacher of 
limited ability and power receives as much for her effort as. 
the more capable one. I am sure this is often the case, for 
the public has been slow in making a clear-cut difference be- 
tween the services of the efficient teacher and the teacher who 
is teaching while she waits. In theory, teachers should be 
paid according to the services rendered, but the distinction is 
hard to estimate. Even if the difference could be definitely 
determined, on account of local conditions salaries cannot be 
fixed entirely on a basis of merit. 
Some cities pay the same salary to all teachers of the ele- 
mentary school, and the same to all teachers of the different 
departments of the high school. Boards of education in these 
cities know that there is a vast difference in the ability of 
these teachers, but because they fear to offend the weak, in- 
efficient teacher more than they fear to do the efficient teacher 
a known injustice, they continue to place them on the same 
salary basis. This method has but little to commend it save 
its simplicity. 
There are other cities that fix the same minimum and maxi- 
mum salary for all the grades in the elementary school, and
-P-A-G-E-360
360 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  the same minimum and maximum for the different departments 
of the high school. This is a much better plan than the one 
mentioned above; however, I would favor making some dis- 
tinction in the departments as to salary. Let these limits be 
made as high as possible, and at the same time raise the 
requirements of scholarship and ability in proportion. In this 
way efficient teachers are sure of an increase of salary each 
year until the maximum is reached. This plan encourages 
good teachers to stay for several years in one place, while it 
makes it possible to get rid of the inefficient teacher without 
any disturbance to the community or those in authority. This 
plan rewards merit. 
One of our leading superintendents has said: 
“To make increase of salary depend upon assignment to a higher grade 
is to cause teachers to regard their present work as temporary and of 
relatively small importance, and to divert their attention from the finer 
problems of the work with the group of children immediately in their 
charge. This policy in school management tends to lessen the efficiency 
of service in the grades from which transfer is sought. For the sake of 
the children for whom the schools exist, therefore, teachers should be 
able to secure increase of salary in present work, not exclusively away 
from it; at least they should not be forced by considerations of salary to 
bend their efforts toward getting away from present work. Taste and 
aptitude should govern in such adjustments. To place a higher money 
value on teaching in the upper grades would imply that these grades 
require more of the teacher in education, training, skill and effort than 
is required for thoroughly good work in lower and intermediate grades. 
If the authorities fix a higher salary for upper grade work, teachers not 
‘well adapted to it will seek it solely on account of the financial induce- 
ment offered. It is to be expected that they will magnify the value of 
the work that carries the higher salary, and to proportionate extent be- 
little the value of service in the lower grades.” 
Experience has been suggested as a proper basis for increase 
of salary. This basis is all right and worthy of consideration, 
but it is necessary that the experience be obtained in the right 
atmosphere, else it might be a detriment rather than a help 
to the teacher. If the teacher has been in a good system of 
schools, and has had expert help and supervision, then I accept 
that experience is worth while and should be considered in 
any scheme for the systematic increase of salaries. 
Some think that examinations may be made an element in 
the increase of salaries. Under wise direction they may serve 
 
-P-A-G-E-361

a very valuable purpose, but they are valuable, in the main, 
by aiding the supervisor to detect weaknesses and defects that 
he might otherwise overlook. Their value is negative to a 
large extent. 
In some places the marking system is employed to good 
advantage. That is, the supervisor grades his teachers on 
different points while making his rounds, and this at the proper 
time is used as a basis for his recommendations in reference 
to promotion and salary increase. This is a good system and 
has much that is commendable. Yet it has its limitations and 
should not be used alone. The supervisor must be competent 
and just in dealing with his teachers, else this plan might work 
injustice to the teacher. 
There are many devices for judging teachers’ work. I have 
mentioned several. All of them have their strong and weak 
points. Perhaps one of the safest plans is to judge results, and 
yet this is not an easy matter; for there are various standards 
as to correct results in teaching. In order to be fair and just 
to the teacher and all concerned, he should be tested on several 
recognized qualities, and the estimate for promotion and in- 
crease of salaries should be an average of these. 
It may be asked, who should judge these qualities in teachers 
and form the estimates for promotion and increase of salary. 
In my opinion the principal’s estimate should be one of the 
most potent factors. Of course, the superintendent’s opinion 
should have first consideration, and in case of conflict between 
his and the principal’s estimate, his estimate should obtain. 
After all that has been said, it must be admitted that 
efficiency is the only just and equitable basis for promotion and 
increase of salary. Merit must decide the matter. 
THE PROPER BASIS FOR THE PROMOTION OF TEACH- 
ERS AND INCREASE OF SALARIES. 
J. P, WOMACK, MAGNOLIA, ARK. 
I am glad to note that Superintendent Toland conceives of 
promotion as a matter of assignment to positions requiring 
superior ability, rather than of transfer to a so-called higher 
grade. There is a feeling among grade teachers that an assign- 
ment to the high school would be a promotion. But such 
assignment, per se, is not promotion. It is no more honorable 
 
-P-A-G-E-362
362 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
to teach Latin than the multiplication table, and the teacher 
who is moved from the grade where multiplication is taught 
to the one where Latin is taught, simply because she is better 
adapted to that work, is not promoted. Such shifting is a 
matter of adjustment rather than promotion, though the pro- 
motional feature may be present. The teacher who is moved 
from a quiet, easily managed room to one that is noisy and 
unruly because of her known disciplinary skill, is promoted, 
and of right should receive an increase of salary. Or, the 
principal of a five-room school who, because of his proved 
ability in organization or executive force, is transferred to a 
twenty-room school, is promoted and should get an increase of 
salary. Promotion then, in the sense here used, is to be as- 
signed to a more difficult place because of one’s proved ability 
to handle a more difficult situation. 
As to the basis for promotion, as indicated in the paper, I 
am in hearty agreement. There is, however, one phase of the 
subject which I think deserves additional emphasis. It is this: 
Many teachers have splendid literary and professional equip- 
ment, and yet do not succeed as well in their work as we 
think they should. They read professional literature, attend 
educational meetings, spend their vacations in school, and yet 
their teaching does not perceptibly improve. What is the mat- 
ter with them? 
Their knowledge does not function. They do not assimilate 
the lessons learned and reorganize their methods of work 
around the new idea. They drag along from year to year and, 
thanks to the system in vogue in many of our cities, finally 
slip into the best positions and draw the maximum salaries. 
No wonder we face the ever-recurring charge of inefficiency. 
There should be a way to get at the teachers’ inefficiency. 
There should be devised a means of checking up the teachers’ 
work to estimate its worth. Superintendent Toland is right 
in saying that this duty devolves upon the superintendent 
and his supervisory staff. 
Permit me now to indicate a way of establishing what seems 
to me a proper basis for promotion and increase of salaries. 
You will observe that my suggestions are practically in line 
with the recommendations made by Superintendent Toland. 
The foundation idea of the scheme is efficiency. What has
-P-A-G-E-363
  ee ee ee 
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 363 
the teacher done that is worth while? We must know this 
before we can even guess what she can do. If she has done 
well, and if her assets bear the right proportion to her lia- 
bilities, we may safely rely on her to do well in a more exact- 
ing situation. 
The second idea is, the ability of the teacher to transmute 
knowledge into skill. Can the teacher use what she knows and 
is learning from year to year? If not, she is incapable of 
growth. Her going to teachers’ meetings and attending summer 
schools means nothing to the school, unless the knowledge thus 
acquired functions in her daily work. 
To these basic principles let me add the items enumerated 
in the paper-scholastic and professional training, love for the 
work, attitude toward those in authority, ability to manage 
children, habits of preparation, etc. Let the superintendent, 
in person or through his supervisors, keep accurate records of 
the teachers’ activity in the school room, on the play ground, 
in the teachers’ study circle, at the institutes, in the vacation 
schools, and, if possible, in the community life, covering at 
least the following points: 
(a) Scholastic attainment—does she know her subject 
(b) Professional knowledge—does she know the educational value of 
the particular unit of subject-matter she is teaching? 
(c) Professional skill—can she teach? 
(d) Attitude toward those in authority—is she loyal? 
(e) Adjustability—does she fit into the system? 
(f) Progressiveness—is she trying to grow? 
(g) Teachableness—does her knowledge function? s 
(h) Disciplinary skill—does she maintain order, and how does she 
do it? 
(i) Personality—what of her personal equation? 
(j) General results—does she hold her attendance? Does she grow 
on the pupils? Do her pupils show signs of awakening powers? What 
per cent of her pupils pass? Do her pupils succeed in the next grade? 
Do dull, careless, intractable or vicious pupils show complete, or even 
partial, transformation when subjected to her influence? 
You will be ready to object that this long list of requirements 
falls heavily on the superintendent and his supervisory force. 
Yes, but it is to do such work that they are employed. And 
the superintendent, who really wishes to get results worth 
while, welcomes the announcement of a plan capable of scien- 
tific application.

In the second place it does not even take into account the 
popular tenure-of-position idea, except in so far as tenure of 
position enables the supervisor thoroughly to guage the teach- 
er’s worth. 
In the next place it makes the interests of the school para- 
mount. It conceives of teachers as existing for the school and 
not vice versa. 
It lays supreme emphasis on efficiency. 
Finally, it presupposes that the successful teacher will do 
certain things better because she has done certain other things 
well. “He that is faithful in little is faithful also in much.” 
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION PROBLEMS IN THE SOUTH. 
W. F. DOUGHTY, SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS, MARLIN, TEXAS. 
“School Administration Problems in the South” is a great 
subject for any man to discuss with ample time at his disposal. 
It is one frought with almost innumerable sub-topics, any one 
of which might require more time for fair treatment than is at 
my disposal for this discussion; it is one worthy of the most 
careful consideration of the greatest educator in the land or 
of the profoundest statesman in public affairs; and it is one 
now commanding the attention of thinking people in one form 
or another as hardly no other subject can interest them. 
THE GREAT PROBLEM. 
The problem of school administration here in the South that 
rises above all others in importance is the one demanding the 
education of all the people whether white or black, native or 
foreign, high or low, rural or urban. We are educating most 
of the white children of the South and some of the negroes; 
but, if education is good for most of the white people and some 
of the negroes, why then is it not good for all the people? If 
education is as good as we have claimed that it is, and if it 
will do as much for the individual as we have said that it 
would, then we ought by some means bring all the children into 
the schools. Here I wish to be clearly understood as believing 
that education adjusted to meet the needs of the people is the 
very best thing in the world for any man. It is good for all 
people alike if it qualifies them to live cleaner and better lives 
and prepares them for higher social service in their respective
-P-A-G-E-365

fields of duty. Education must make a man the better for 
having had it or else it should be termed mis-education. ; 
With reference to universal education the South presents its 
own peculiar situation. Economic and social conditions have 
not readily contributed to the cause. Being largely an agricul- 
tural people the children have been kept from school to work in 
the cotton fields, especially those of the poorer classes of both 
whites and negroes. And, too, the South has been made to 
bear the brunt of the curse of slavery. Millions of ignorant 
negroes were freed in our midst and left for us to educate with 
our own funds. In our efforts to do them and our own children 
justice and at the same time come out from under the wreck 
and ruin of the war between the States, we have been unable 
to make anything like satisfactory progress in comparison with 
our sister States, North and East. The inclusion of these 
negroes in all Southern statistics has served to belittle the 
white man of the South in the eyes of the world as it relates 
to his progress and achievement. Although education in the 
South is largely voluntary, nevertheless all the States con- 
tribute without discrimination toward the education of all 
the children even though it be scanty in some cases. The prob- 
lem of getting the children out of the cotton fields into the 
schools for a portion of the year is quite a difficult one, I grant 
you; but it is not much more serious in its nature than that 
one presented in the towns and cities of the South by the less 
fortunate of both races. 
Statistics show that we are not educating all of our children. 
We are permitting hundreds of thousands of our Southern chil- 
dren to go each year without even entering a school of any 
kind whatever. The report of the Commissioner of Education 
in the United States for 1910 shows that there were exactly 
2,648,341 children in the South between the ages of five and 
eighteen who did not enroll in school at all during the year 
1908-1909, and more than 500,000 of these appear to be white 
children. Practically all of these children are within reach 
of public free schools, yet their parents do not see the reasons 
why they should send their children to school, or, if they do 
see them, circumstances fail to favor school attendance. So 
long as conditions remain as they are, the evil of ignorance 
will continue to grow, for this ignorant population continues 
to increase as population increases.   
 
-P-A-G-E-366
  366 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
You sometimes hear people object to universal education, be- 
cause, as they say, it tends to bring about equality of races, of 
classes, and of individuals. This is not necessarily true, for 
education is supposed to bring out the inequalities of men and 
show them up for what they are worth to society from the 
standpoint of useful service, and that is what sometimes cuts 
worse than a two-edged sword. Education develops a child 
according to God’s plan, it tags the man for what he is worth, 
it classes the hewers of wood and the drawers of water, and 
its intent is to reward each individual according as is his due. 
Men often oppose the movement for universal education be- 
cause they have been taught that the general prosperity of the 
people depends upon there being a large population of ignorant 
people from whom shall come the laborers. Men will oppose the 
movement for political reasons because they know that an 
appeal to the prejudices of the people is sometimes more effec- 
tive in turning the balance of power than is the power of 
reason. In this day of personal greed there is no hesitancy 
on the part of some to exploit child labor for financial advance- 
ment, and these, too, we may expect to oppose any movement 
looking to the liberation of the masses through popular educa- 
tion. Patriotic men will defend the movement because they 
believe that education is the greatest factor in perpetuating the 
blessings of civil liberty and in promoting the general peace 
and prosperity of all the people. 
| EDUCATING PUBLIC OPINION. 
Another great problem in the administration of school affairs 
in the South, and one which is largely a preliminary to the 
realization of the first, is the one relating to the development 
of public opinion in favor of educating all the people. People 
generally have just as good schools as they want, and the prob- 
lems now is to get them to wanting better schools and better 
environments. A campaign amoag the “grown-ups” is neces- 
sary to inform them of the great benefits to be derived from 
the education of all the children and to explain to them the 
ways and means of establishing and maintaining adequate 
school facilities for all the people. The citizens of a democracy 
must have confidence in any general plan of education before 
they are going to give it their moral support and financial 
endorsement. When the people see that it is the right thing
-P-A-G-E-367
JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 367 
to do and are convinced that it will pay, then there will be 
nothing left for us to do but to inaugurate definite plans for 
action. While most people grant that education is a paying 
investment both socially and financially they have not fully 
realized the great possibilities in educating the other fellow’s 
child. If they did fully comprehend the marvelous dividends, 
so to speak, that education of the right kind will yield through 
the individual to society in general, they would be tempted to 
go sell all their goods and invest in education. 
In this stage of the propaganda of universal education we 
stand in need of educational prophets, as it were, full of the 
faith, who can dream dreams and see visions of good to come; 
and of great men who, possessing the power of the spirit, are 
willing to live the vicarious life, if need be, in order that we 
may secure to the children of the South the blessings that a 
knowledge of the truth brings unto all men. As educators we 
must raise up in our midst leaders among men, who can so 
burn the truth of their convictions into the hearts of men that 
they, seeing, will spring into obedient action, ready to do what 
they know to be right. In this connection permit me to quote 
Dutton and Snedden, who say, “A constant factor in the 
development and growth of American education and the im- 
provement of administration has been the active labors of 
men and women who were in a certain sense prophets and who 
were able to communicate their ideals and their aspirations to 
others.” We need men with strong personalities to reconstruct 
our ways of thinking of education and to lead us to a realiza- 
tion of our extraordinary possibilities in the development of 
the intellectual resources of our people. 
This is the age of golden opportunity for the realization of 
extraordinary achievements. Once we thought that history 
was made by waging relentless wars of subjugation upon the 
enemy or that that man was great who could lead a successful 
expedition of conquest into new lands, but now we like 
to read in our books of the successes that have crowned 
the efforts of men in their struggles for civil and re- 
ligious liberty, of the great factors of civilization that 
have contributed to the world’s progress, and of the 
achievements of men that make life on earth now 
full of opportunity for the accomplishment of greater 
 
-P-A-G-E-368
  368 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
deeds than have yet been realized. A new situation now pre- 
sents itself, and he who would be patriotic and great must 
lend himself soul and body to the establishment of better social 
conditions. That man who can effect great changes in the 
minds of the people for good is greater than he who destroys a 
navy or defeats an army. 
In my remarks upon this topic of my subject I would not be 
unmindful of the great work being done in the South by the 
several State departments of education, by the departments 
of extension in our colleges and universities, by the different 
conferences for education working in our midst, by philan- 
thropic individuals and societies working for the advancement 
of universal learning. They have accomplished wonders, but 
only a beginning has been made. The most and the least that 
can be said in this connection is that we need more of them 
and stronger ones. 
Commercialism has robbed the profession of many of its 
brightest prospects for the work under consideration. Men 
with capacities for doing things are needed in other fields where 
the remuneration for efficient service is more attractive to some. 
Many of our most promising young teachers are seized upon 
bodily and removed without ceremony, you might say, from the 
field of education to commercial and industrial ranks. Some 
of us who are not thus called lose much valuable time waiting 
for the summons that does not come. Give us men like Robert 
E. Lee, who can decline princely salaries if there be need of 
it to accept poorly remunerative work if it will promote the 
general interest of education. Give us more men like Curry 
and Baldwin and McIver and Claxton and others who can 
forget themselves in their incessant labors for universal edu- 
cation. We need such men in every State, in each county, and 
in each community in order that we may hasten the day when 
all the people of the South shall have school privileges ade- 
quate to their individual needs. In the words of Sidney Lanier 
I would encourage you to, 
“Yield not to the lures 
In the clefts of the hills of Habersham, 
In the beds of the valley of Hall 
Downward the voices of duty call— 
Downward, to toil and be mixed with the main, 
The dry fields burn and the mills are to turn,
-P-A-G-E-369
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 369 
And a myriad of flowers mortally yearn 
And the lordly main from beyond the plain 
Calls over the hills of Habersham; 
Calls through the valley of Hall.” 
THE FINANCIAL PROBLEM, 
The financial problem is generally uppermost in the adminis- 
tration of public affairs. Money is always needed where good 
schools are maintained, and yet we have no satisfactory method 
of raising the necessary funds for the support of the school 
system that will be adequate in the promotion of the plans 
already projected for the education of all the people. Every 
advance step in education calls for an increased outlay of pub- 
lic funds. New types of education and better teaching effi- 
ciency can be had only by increased expenditures. The length- 
ening of the school term in the poorer districts, the provisions 
for compulsory attendance, free text-books, and expert super- 
vision make increased demands upon the State as a whole. 
State universities with their departments of extension, likewise 
the agricultural and mechanical colleges, industrial colleges, 
normal schools, and State schools for the dependent, delinquent, 
and defective children are all calling upon the State for in- 
creased appropriations. The amount spent annually in the 
South for elementary and secondary schools is more than 
$176,000,000, and yet this enormous expenditure of public 
money is inadequate to the new demands. Large as it may 
appear, it is small in comparison with some others. Billion 
dollar congresses are now on record. Many times this amount 
over is spent annually in maintaining courts and jails and 
prisons in the South. Our citizens spend several times as 
much for liquor each year as they do for free schools, while 
the cost of tobacco surpasses it. 
Is the State justified that increases its expenditures for 
public education in the South? I would answer this question 
by asking two others. Is not education a means of increasing 
social efficiency? Is not the investment made in schools ulti- 
mately returned to the State many times over in increased 
earning capacities and living efficiency of its citizenship? Com- 
pilations have been made which show that the graph repre- 
senting the average expenditures per capita by States for pub- 
lic free schools is closely paralleled by the one representing 
24
-P-A-G-E-370
370 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
the average earning capacities of the citizens of the same States. 
In other words, the average earning capacities of the citizens 
of the States rise or fall as the average expenditure per capita 
for education rise or fall. History is an open book to that fact 
that no nation ever achieved remarkable advances in civiliza- 
tion where the masses remained in ignorance any length of 
time. From the declaration of independence of the Republic 
of Texas we have a significant assertion which says, “It is an 
axiom of political science that, unless a people are educated 
and enlightened, it is idle to expect the continuance of civil 
liberty or the capacity for self-government.” Thomas Jefferson 
is recorded as saying that if a nation expects to be ignorant 
and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what never was 
and never will be. Robert E. Lee said that the education of 
all classes of people is the best means of promoting the pros- 
perity of the South. 
In general the chief source of revenue to the State, the county 
and the locality is the taxation of private property, the in- 
creased annual expenditures is sufficing in some localities to 
make the rate of taxation rather burdensome on the individual 
citizen. Special tax commissions, as in New York State, have 
been successful in relieving personal property from burden of 
heavy taxation. Many students of finance now believe that 
some form of indirect taxation, as corporation and franchise 
taxes, should be enacted by the State to supplement the funds 
being raised from taxation of private property. A premium, 
nevertheless, should always be placed upon local effort; and no 
matter how poor a community may be, the people should con- 
tribute in some way, to some extent, to the management and 
support of. the local school, and be required to meet certain 
standards as regards results. 
In connection with the expenditure of public school funds 
there arises the very complex problem of equitable distribution 
of State and county funds to the children sharing this money. 
A very responsible duty devolves upon the State boards of 
education in distributing State funds so that the maximum 
of results may be obtained. State funds should never be dis- 
tributed merely to give equal educational opportunity to all 
children, even though that might be the aim; but some system, 
as the one in use in Florida, which gives additional aid to
-P-A-G-E-371
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 871 
schools making an average daily attendance of eighty per cent 
or more, should be inaugurated to stimulate local effort. The 
apportionment of funds by the per capita enrollment plan has 
never yielded the best results because it fails to stimulate as 
it should local effort and it does not give equal school oppor- 
tunities as to length of term. The ability of a community to 
support a school and the interest the people manifest in that 
school should be the two governing factors in the distribution 
of public funds. 
THE PROBLEM OF STRONGER ORGANIZATION. 
Before there can be any satisfactory degree of efficiency in 
the administration of public education in the South there must 
be maintained a sane system of school organization. Strong 
organization is necessary to eliminate waste of time for the 
child, to reduce cost to the State, and to increase the efficiency 
of the contributing forces of education. From the local unit 
to the national there is little system in school organization. 
The history of the beginnings of school legislation in all the 
States of the nation shows that local codperation came first and 
then of necessity followed State school legislation. Early con- 
stitutions made little or no mention of school organization al- 
though there are many evidences that the founders of the 
Republic wished to support public education. As matters 
progressed school atfairs have grown and become more complex 
so that now school organization is a very much discussed 
problem here in the South. Then the question is, how are we 
going to organize our educational machinery that we may get 
the greatest efficiency for the investment made in education? 
The tendency now is away from local organization toward 
centralization of educational forces, which means that author- 
ity and responsibility of school administration is being removed 
wholly or in part from local unit to the more centralized and 
remote. For example, there is more tendency now to amend 
State constitutions so as to specify the details of school admin- 
istration than formerly. The organization of State and county 
educational machinery, the specific designation of school funds, 
and the regulation of other pertinent matters are now finding 
their way into State constitutions. 
No State organization that seeks to eliminate entirely local 
organization and responsibility can be justified in a democracy,
-P-A-G-E-372
  872 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
but State and county organizations that have for their purpose 
close codperation with the local unit in the education of its 
children are highly desirable. Since the education of all the 
children of the State is such a tremendous undertaking, it is 
thought that a division of the responsibility between the three 
units, the State, the county and the community, is advisable for 
the promotion of educational efficiency. State boards of edu- 
cation should be authorized to codperate with the State super- 
intendent in the administration of State school matters in 
accordance with the constitutional provisions and the enact- 
ments of their respective legislatures. Likewise there should 
be authorized for each county a board of education whose duty 
it would be to assist the county school superintendent with 
the administration of county school matters; and also a local 
board in each community to attend to purely local matters as 
they relate to the school. Whether these boards should be 
elected or appointed, and when and by whom, are questions not 
yet satisfactorily answered; but that these boards should be 
composed of able men who are thoroughly in sympathy with the 
ideals of public education there is no doubt. No ex officio 
board of education is any longer able to meet the requirements 
and responsibilities of the increased duties resting upon it as 
the administrative agency of either State or county education. 
An efficient, local organization is the ideal, I grant you; but, 
since there are so few of them in evidence, we find strong State 
and county organizations absolutely necessary to stimulate and 
reinforce local effort. 
EXPERT SUPERVISION. 
The problem of securing expert school supervision has not yet 
been worked out satisfactorily by any State. By this I mean 
that we have no adequate means of giving the schools outside of 
the better organized cities and towns anything like real con- 
structive school supervision. The supervisor should set stand- 
ards for pupils and teachers, and then help them in their efforts 
to realize the attainment of these aims. As it is, school super- 
vision is too far between to be effective in its results. The 
State Superintendent can do little more than collect a few sta- 
tistics, publish some general observation of the progress of edu- 
cation, and make appropriation of school funds. The county 
school superintendent can make but one or two visits during
-P-A-G-E-373
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 873 
the year to each school under his care, which may enable him 
to determine fairly well the character of work being done; but 
what of his opportunity to do real constructive work with the 
teacher he sees in school only once or twice during the school 
term? 
Supervision in the larger towns and cities is, as a rule, fairly 
satisfactory. Over each small group of teachers, usually not 
more than twelve, is a supervising principle, who is generally 
permitted to devote much of his time daily with his teachers in 
working out details of constructive teaching. Working through 
the different schools of the city we find the various supervisors 
of primary methods, of drawing, of music, of writing, and of 
other branches if thought necessary, all of whom are centering 
their efforts with those of the teachers toward the realization 
of the highest degree of efficiency that skill and insight of super- 
vision and the art of teaching can secure. Over the supervisors, 
the principal, and the teachers, is the superintendent who coér- 
dinates the work of the whole system. As much cannot be said 
of the situation in the rural districts, for, generally speaking, 
the rural schools of the South are not given the advantage of 
real constructive supervision. How they are going to get it is 
another unsolved problem. 
If supervision is advantageous to the city child, then why is 
it not good for the rural child? Wherever he may be con- 
structive school supervision is just as necessary to the child’s 
welfare as superintending in any other line is to the improve- 
ment of the service. In order to make a railroad company suc- 
cessful there is careful expert supervision from the road gang 
to the directorate. There is the section boss, the road master, 
division superintendent, general superintendent, general man- 
ager, and the directorate. In addition to these we find the 
railroad company employing numerous inspectors, as bridge 
inspector, pump inspector, and car inspector—all of whom are 
retained that the service of the company may be made satis- 
factory to the public and profitable to the company. Like- 
wise is handled the United States banking system and the post- 
office service. So complete in organization and supervision is 
either of these systems that even incompetent help is not per- 
mitted to make mistakes that go uncorrected. Then why not 
provide all of our schools with expert school supervision, so
-P-A-G-E-374

that inefficient teaching will no longer hinder the progress of 
our children? Are our children worth less than dollars? Is 
their advancement of less worth than-the transportation of a 
patent medicine almanac? 
In the combining of supervision areas it is economically de- 
sirable that each superisor shall have not more than thirty 
teachers under his immediate supervision, and that the terri- 
tory thus covered should not exceed one day’s journey from 
the center to the most distant school served. Where practi- 
cable, the smaller towns and nearby districts should combine 
for the purpose of securing closer school supervision. In sev- 
eral of the New England States there are laws compelling each 
town and district to enter into some kind of supervisory union. 
In the South we stand in need of laws that will put more su- 
pervisory officers in the rural districts—men and women who 
can help the teachers do real constructive work with pupils 
and parents. 
In the selection of a supervisor more than one local board 
may be concerned, likewise the county and State if they con- 
tribute to his support. Various plans of selection have been 
proposed and some have been practiced with success. It is 
generally believed that these supervisors should be nominated 
by the county superintendent and elected by a joint committee 
representing all the schools interested. Such a plan is in 
harmony with the spirit of democracy, and at the same time 
guards against incompetency by giving a chance to the superin- 
tendent to name an expert supervisor, under whose direction he 
will work. 
While it is desirable that the local unit meet its pro rata of 
expense of the supervisor, yet in many instances this cannot 
be done. Since the county and the State are to profit from the 
investment in education, it is generally thought that they 
should bear such part of the expense as is necessary to secure it. 
Supervision thus exercised may well be regarded as a sort of 
extension work of the State. 
THE THACHER PROBLEM IS UNSOLVED. 
You have heard it said that the teacher, the pupil, and the 
place of meeting make the school; but I would also remind 
you that as the teacher is, so will be the school. The respon-
-P-A-G-E-375

sibility of securing, placing, and building up strong teachers 
for the children of the schools rests heavily upon administra- 
tive heads. A few years ago we had no system of schools de- 
manding teachers, but with the advent of the public free school 
there has been an everincreasing demand for more and better 
teachers. At the present time we number more than 150,000 
strong in the South. In point of numbers we are more than 
three-fifths as large as the aggregate of the entire Confederate 
Army, and yet the numbers must grow to supply the demand. 
The ones we have must be kept growing in efficiency, while 
thousands of others must be prepared each year for the serv- 
ice. The selection and dismissal of teachers, their examination 
and certification, their improvement and length of service, 
their promotion, specialization, and pensioning are special 
teacher problems that have not yet been worked out satisfac- 
torily by any one, and their detailed discussion is too long for 
this paper. 
Before the inauguration of the free school system in the 
South the teacher was more of a transient being than now. 
Rarely did he have a family, and less often did he have a fixed 
boarding place in the community where he taught subscription 
school. <A little evidence of a working knowledge of the ele- 
mentary subjects and an ability to handle well the rod were 
usually the only requirements made of the man who came to 
“take up school” in the community. After the introduction of 
free schools higher and better standards were exacted of those 
who would be teachers. The establishment of the normal 
school soon followed for the purpose of giving the prospective 
teacher professional training along with their academic learn- 
ing. This period which is characterized by professional train- 
ing may be regarded as the second in the evolution of the 
Southern teacher. In more recent years—in fact, now—we 
are talking about selecting, retaining, and promoting teachers 
on the basis of professional efficiency, meaning that a teacher’s 
worth to her school is to be determined by her powers to bring 
about desirable changes in the minds of her pupils that will 
ultimately give them strength of character. This period 
marked with the beginning of professional efficiency may be 
regarded as the third in the evolution of the teacher, the estab- 
ment of which presents a difficult problem. 
 
-P-A-G-E-376
  376 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The certification of teachers in the South has thus far been 
of such a character as to permit many opportunities for the 
abuse of the profession. With the inauguration of the free 
school system there came an unprecedented demand for 
teachers. Nearly any one with a little knowledge of the ele- 
mentary subjects could secure appointment as teacher in some 
school and earn some ready money. If a young man in the 
course of his preparation for law, or medicine or any other 
profession found himself in straitened circumstances as to 
finances, the schoolroom has offered him a ready source of 
relief. If a young lady, previous to her matrimonial tie, finds 
herself in need of money to tide her over the pre-nuptial 
period, she likewise has turned to the schoolroom with some 
satisfaction. In more than one case the educated man who 
has been unsuccessful in other callings has found himself re- 
deemed in the ranks of the teacher. The custom among the 
ladies of getting married, and the practice of using the profes- 
sion as a stepping-stone by others, results in complete regi- 
mentation of our forces about once in three years in the 
South. This regimentation problem I regard as one of the 
most difficult of solution in the administration of schools. 
I would keep these promising prospects rather than let them 
go, although they may not have entered the profession with 
intentions of remaining. There is evidence already that we 
offer inducements enough to the beginner, but not enough to 
retain them and make them seek to improve their teaching effi- 
ciency. Some of our leading lawyers, doctors, preachers, and 
successful business men have first demonstrated their abilities 
to do things by teaching awhile. As a beginning it paid them 
well. We should reconstruct our educational machinery so 
that it will be possible for us to promote and advance the 
successful and efficient teacher on the basis of merit alone. 
This will aid in giving the profession rank in the affairs of 
men in proportion to its greatness as a factor in the world’s 
progress. Be it far from me to have you regard the financial 
reward as the only inducement to enter the profession of teach- 
ing the young. Well do I know that man liveth not by bread 
alone, but I regard it as rather essential in providing a com- 
fortable home, in supporting a family, and in developing pro- 
fessional efficiency. There is no temporal law that forces any 
one into the profession of teaching, and because one has en-
-P-A-G-E-377
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 377 
tered it, there is no reason why she should be made to forego 
any temporal need in order to instruct the youth of the land. 
The teacher loves home and family and friends and the com- 
forts of life somewhat as other people appreciate them. 
As matters now stand, we are in need of virile teaching. 
Originally men did nearly all of the teaching, which was un- 
satisfactory in a measure; now women do eighty per cent of it 
in the South. Away from the rural districts where the 
father and son work side by side—in cities, particularly—the 
children have little chance to learn anything of their fathers, 
good or bad. With the growth of the cities has come the busi- 
ness man, the traveling man, and the office man, and home to 
them has come to mean a place of rest, mainly, and at his 
request the children are kept away from the father too much. 
Children are learning all the virtues of their mothers, but are 
failing to get from their fathers at the right time that virility 
of character so necessary in daily contact with the world out- 
side the home. Careful observations show that neither boys 
nor girls can well afford to be deprived of the influence of the 
father or of some responsible male friend. If a boy cannot 
get this influence at home, he is going to get it somewhere else ; 
and the next best place to get it is at the school. 
In nowise do I depreciate high and worthy estimates that 
have been placed upon the mother’s influence and teaching; 
in fact, I regard it as far superior to that of the father, but 
the influence of the father is the complement of that of the 
mother, and both are necessary to complete the home circle of 
influence and responsibility. Nor would I undertake the work 
being done by our worthy co-laborers, the ladies; we could not 
dispense with their services if we would. We need more 
strong men in the profession to reinforce the situation. The 
women have done their parts nobly, but the plan is that man 
shall bear his part of the responsibility of rearing and training 
the child, and it is his part that is being largely neglected. If 
I am clearly understood, you will see that I am in favor of 
more real men teachers in the schools, men who are the equal 
of the most efficient women now there. 
THE HYGIENIC SITUATION. 
The lack of hygienic conditions in the schools of the South 
has hindered the progress of our children more than we are
-P-A-G-E-378
    378 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
willing to admit. We are just now awakening to the impor- 
tance of sanitation with reference to the welfare of our chil- 
dren. A widespread interest is now taking hold upon the 
minds of the people with reference to the hygienic situation 
that is going to do more for the social uplift and the material 
advancement of our people than all the legislative bodies of 
the land can do for them. Schoolhouses are now being located. 
with more precaution as to elevation and protection, their con- 
struction is being studied more from the standpoint of the 
school’s needs, and their furniture and equipments are being 
placed more for the convenience of the young student than for 
appearances. In a few more years, if matters progress as we 
hope they may, it may come to pass that the schoolhouse will 
be so complete in its appointments that the child will feel 
quite at ease in the schoolroom, and work will become a pleas- 
ure to him. 
To secure general hygienic conditions the school is only the 
starting point. Some of the homes, many of the streets, and a 
number of the rural districts must be reached. Here lies the 
problem. How are we going to accelerate this interest in the 
hygiene of living until it penetrates every nook and corner and 
wipes out the causes of physical irregularities? Certainly 
the school can do no greater service than to instruct the chil- 
dren in such a way that they will understand, and understand- 
ing, will enlist the support of their parents in the fight against 
unsanitary conditions, insect sources of contagion, as regards 
malaria, typhoid, and some other preventable diseases. This 
work of giving instruction in hygienic living may be done in 
an informal way, though by devoting a definite amount of 
time to it, by making use of the materials of the environing life 
of the child. Formal instruction should be given where pos- 
sible in the practical application of the principles of house- 
hold science with reference to sanitation, dietetics, contagious 
diseases, care of the sick, effects of stimulants, narcotics, 
growth of strength, formation of good habits, and physical 
ideal. Talks, illustrated lectures, and experiments should be 
given as often as suitable occasions present themselves until 
all the people can appreciate the advantages of general 
hygienic conditions and are willing to apply their knowledge 
toward health preservation.

WHAT SHALL WE TEACH SOUTHERN CHILDREN? 
Just what we should teach our Southern children is a great 
problem difficult of solution. For centuries men have been at- 
tempting to tell us what we ought to teach children, and it 
might be well for us to pause long enough to examine some of 
the answers. The ancient Jew says, “Teach him the piety of 
Jehovah, that he may be good;” the Spartan says, “Teach him 
to develop physical strength, endurance, and patriotism, that 
he may be a useful citizen;” Plato raises his voice out of the 
historic past and says, “Teach him to control his appetite and 
balance the elements of the soul, so that each may tend to the 
perfection of the other ;” Herbert Spencer, of more recent time, 
says, “Teach him that knowledge which is of most worth, 
which is science;” and Herbart says, “Teach them morality, 
for it is the highest aim of humanity, and consequently of 
education.” But none of these men quite solve our problem 
here in the South, I fear. I would that our children have 
the piety of Jehovah, the physical development of the Spartan, 
the control of Plato, the knowledge of Spencer, and the moral- 
ity of Herbart; but I fear then that there might be a deficiency 
in their education. They have not been trained in service. 
Did not Christ, our Master Teacher, teach that service is the 
true aim of life on earth? 
Our curricula are lacking yet in that they fail to give suffi- 
cient training in the doing of things. Knowledge may be 
power, but without service it is latent power. Education 
should teach the child to know, to love, and to do; and what 
he shall know, what he shall love, and what he shall do de- 
pends largely upon the training he gets in the school. We 
see boys and girls leaving the schools at very tender ages, feel- 
ing that they are not getting the help that they need in the 
solution of life’s problem. We are yet planning too much for 
the pupil that is going to graduate, go higher, and enter some 
one of the learned professions, and we are forgetting the large 
majority of our children who never go through school at all. 
The great problem of life is how to secure food and protection 
for the body, and while this is not the highest aim of life, it, 
nevertheless, is the first aim of life. Consequently education 
should first look to the solution of this great life problem; and, 
 
-P-A-G-E-380
  380 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
secondly, to the highest development of individual social effi- 
ciency. 
As we proceed along the course of civilization the school 
curriculum is made to tax more and more the intellectual ca- 
pacities of the child while not enough is done to train the 
individual in earning an honest living and in making a home. 
Vocational training, including household economics and arts, 
should be given more or less in all schools for the benefit of those 
who are not preparing to enter the higher callings of life. So 
far as social efficiency is concerned, the majority of the children 
are leaving the schools to enter life’s activities for weal or woe 
without any training at all in service. The school that ele- 
vates and broadens the tastes of its pupils through intellectual 
development without giving them the necessary vocational 
training to supply their increased wants stands in great 
danger of having a large percentage of its pupils fall short of 
their possibilities in the world’s work. 
Our education should train for a better general development 
of the physical man. Teachers, pupils, and parents must 
awaken to the meaning of a sound mind in a sound body. 
Life from a physical standpoint has become too easy for our 
boys in the towns and cities, and in consequence thereof we 
find ourselves in danger of a sort of physical degeneracy upon 
the part of our male population in the places named. Our 
athletics are at fault because they fail to reach only a small 
portion of our pupils. Our playgrounds are inadequate to the 
demand, and our children must play in the streets and alleys, 
the child’s energies are misspent, and false tastes are devel- 
oped, which lead him astray in seach of the things that will 
gratify his ungoverned appetite and baser wants. A larger 
portion of the school day should be devoted to systematic and 
instructive play, and in order that this may be done, more 
playgrounds must be provided for the children who should 
play under the direction of teachers who know what play 
means to the development of the child. Provisions should be 
made for the holidays and vacations that the work may not 
fail in its purpose. Games that will engage all the children 
should be selected for their value in bringing about desirable 
physical development and intellectual sagacity. 
From what I have said, you may observe that the problems
-P-A-G-E-381
       JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 381 
of school administration in the South are not very unlike those 
of any other section of our Republic. One of the great prob- 
lems of any people is the education and training of their chil- 
dren so that each individual may perform an admirable share 
of the world’s useful work, earn while doing this work sufii- 
cient of the necessaries and conveniences of life to sustain him- 
self and those dependent upon him, and develop a spirit of 
happiness full of the joy of living right and doing good unto 
others. Such education will approximate the ideal by giving 
the pupil the physique, knowledge, power, and character. 
This is the kind of education we need here in the South to 
qualify our children to share evenly in the industrial prosper- 
ity and the intellectual progress of the future. This is the 
kind of education needed by all people everywhere dispersed 
upon the face of the earth. 
THE DEPARTMENTAL SUPERVISOR. 
SUPT. P. W. HORN, HOUSTON, TEXAS. 
There are two reasons: why the departmental supervisor is 
needed in a city school system of considerable size. (1) There 
are some subjects about which the average superintendent knows 
even less than he does about others. Some of these subjects 
are music and drawing. (2) Even if the superintendent were 
competent to supervise these special subjects, it is not possible 
in a system of any considerable size for him to do so. He lacks 
the time. There is a limit to the number of teachers that any 
one superintendent, without aid, can efficiently supervise. I 
do not undertake to state this exact limit. Perhaps it is about 
fifty teachers. 
The following observations are submitted concerning the 
duties of the departmental supervisor : 
(1) She must be a specialist in her department. She should 
know more about this special work than do any of the teachers 
under her supervision. She should constantly keep in touch 
with the latest and best ideas concerning her specialty. 
(2) She should also be a specialist in human nature. The 
woman who supervises fifty or a hundred or a thousand other 
women has no easy task. She should be on the lookout for 
talent, should know it when she sees it, and should know how to
-P-A-G-E-382
  382 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
develop it. A supervisor who is not a specialist in human 
nature will find a hard task before her and incidentally will 
make hard tasks for a number of other people—including the 
superintendent. 
(8) The supervisor should have due regard for the claims of 
other departments than her own. The supervisor who desires 
to advance her own work by reorganizing and diminishing all 
the rest of the work in the schools will not be effective. The 
supervisor of music, drawing, writing, manual training, and 
domestic science should be zealous for the success of the work 
in their specialties, but should be willing to leave at least a little 
time for reading, spelling, and even arithmetic. 
(4) The supervisor should take the initiative in her depart- 
ment within the limits of the general policy set by the superin- 
tendent and the board. One does not want a supervisor who 
will simply “do as she is told.” She should do the thing before 
she is told; should, in fact, discover what is to be done, and 
have herself and others do it. She should, however, respect 
the general policies agreed on by superintendent and board. 
The general policy as to the amount of money that can be given 
to the department is a case in point. 
(5) The supervisor should work in harmony with the prin- 
cipal of the building so far as routine matters are concerned. 
The general regime of the building should be respected so far 
as is practicable. 
(6) The supervisor should supervise for results rather than 
for exact methods. She should insist that the work by each 
teacher come up to the general standard, and should be both 
willing and able to suggest methods by which this may be done. 
She should, however, require the teacher to reach the result 
rather than to use the method. 
(7) The supervisor must, herself, be willing to be judged by 
her general results. The superintendent and board may not 
know much about the technique of music. They do know, 
however, as to the interest the children take in music, and they 
have a general idea just how well the children sing. They may 
not know much about how to teach writing, but they know in a 
general way as to whether the children are writing better now 
than they did last year, or worse. 
(8) In general, the departmental supervisor must depend
-P-A-G-E-383
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 383 
upon encouragement, inspiration, good will, and general leader- 
ship, and not upon authority or any form of force. The super- 
visor who asks, “How can I make the teachers do thus and so?” 
is on the wrong road. With her even more than with other 
educational workers, it is a question of leading and not of 
driving. 
THE DUTIES OF DEPARTMENT SUPERVISORS. 
In discussion of this subject, Superintendent J. F. Kimball, 
of Temple, Texas, said: 
The duties of the department supervisor are twofold and two- 
sided. Viewed from the standpoint of the subject-matter of her 
department, her duties are, first, to conceive the depth and scope 
of the work of her department, to plan and project it in her own 
mind as an organized, unified, purposeful entity; and, second, 
having thus conceived its scope and breadth and depth, to inter- 
pret this conception to her teachers and their pupils so that it 
shall find expression in the system of schools. The department 
supervisor must be able to see visions and to dream dreams, and 
then, like Daniel of old, to interpret these visions and dreams to 
the working folk of the schoolrooms. 
Viewed from the standpoint of her relations to the pupils of 
the schools, her duties are twofold also. First of all, it is her 
function to reach and touch every pupil under her supervision 
by her interpretation of the subject-matter of her department 
and her inspiration therefrom, to bring to the lives of all the 
children whom she supervises some inkling, some glimpse of 
what her particular field of endeavor may mean to them in their 
lives. Another function no less important is the discovery of 
talent among the few. In every system of schools there are 
pupils with talents undiscovered, often unsuspected. One 
great function of the schools is to discover these unusual talents 
and to give them full expression and opportunity in the lives of 
those who possess them. This duty of the school is especially 
committed into the hands of the supervisors of special depart- 
ments. Every teacher of drawing or music in a system of 
schools is under moral obligation to discover the gifted ones and 
to reach them with the inspiration that shall make their talent 
worth while. 
In addition to the technical preparation which Mr. Horn has 
 
-P-A-G-E-384
384 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
mentioned, it is of great advantage in the training of the super- 
visor of any department that she should have served as a grade 
teacher. The ideal preparation for a supervisor, especially of 
penmanship, drawing or music, is a few years of successful 
experience in the class-room under competent supervision before 
taking up the preparation in specialized work that is to fit her 
for the narrower field of departmental supervising. It is essen- 
tial that the department supervisor shall have in her own mind 
a clear notion of what a second-grade child is and what may be 
expected of him in interest, attention and achievement, of what 
a fourth-grade child is and what he can do. She needs to know 
something in a practical, concrete, common-sense way of the 
development of children at various stages of the school life. 
This additional point is essential for the highest efficiency in 
departmental supervision, and many school systems lose by 
failing to recognize its importance—namely, that any subject 
presenting sufficient value and enough technical difficulties to 
justify the employment of a special supervisor deserves to be 
taught by special teachers, not by the general teaching body. Of 
necessity this is the common practice in domestic science and 
manual training, but the truth is not so generally recognized 
as to singing and drawing. Every reason that justifies the 
employment of a special departmental supervisor in these sub- 
jects applies with equal force to the employment of special 
teachers. The work of the supervisor should be confined to a 
few teachers in each building. Her work should not be spread 
out so thin that it loses its personal force, nor should her in- 
spiration be transmitted to the pupils through such a poor con- 
ductor that its electrifying power is gone when it reaches the 
pupils. If all your teachers teach drawing, it will happen not 
infrequently that one year a gifted pupil has a gifted teacher 
and grows wonderfully in power and skill, but the next year 
this same pupil is taught by a teacher whose weakest point is 
drawing, one who might well learn of this pupil in some ways. 
This is a tragedy. Most of the real teaching of penmanship is 
done in the language work and in the other written work of the 
daily routine, so that there is not the same chance to protect the 
pupils from the teacher who writes poorly. For this reason, I 
am fully persuaded that no new or young teacher should be 
employed in the grades below the high school who does not write 
   
-P-A-G-E-385
  JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGS. 385 
a good hand. No teacher of writing or supervisor of penman- 
ship is gifted enough to teach pupils to write well habitually 
with the added burden of a teacher who is a sloven in her hand- 
writing. For our own individual comfort, we may mutually 
agree that the same standard of fitness need not apply to us 
superintendents. 
One of the best ways to develop department supervisors of 
music and of drawing is to select certain teachers in each 
building to take charge of these lines of work under the direc- 
tion of the general supervisor of the department. This gives 
opportunity to show capacity, arouses ambition, and is a prep- 
aration for sympathetic work later in supervision. The teacher 
gains valuable training in that matter of adjustment to the 
other interests of the schools with tact and good fellowship to 
which Superintendent Horn alluded. 
THE KIND OF SUPERVISION MOST NEEDED. 
SUPT. J. M. GWINN, NEW ORLBANS, LA. 
That kind of supervision is most needed which meets the needs 
of the community. Communities vary in their needs, first, be- 
cause they differ in the elements which make up their economic, 
political, social, and spiritual life; and secondly, because 
different communities have attained different stations and pro- 
cesses in their course of development. It is, therefore, impos- 
sible to give a specific answer to the query as to what kind of 
supervision is most needed, or one which will be equally valid 
for all communities. It is possible, however, to indicate the 
general principles of supervision and some of the lines along 
which they should operate. 
A second difficulty one meets in discussing the topic is met 
with in the broad, vague and changing meaning given the word 
supervision. If in supervision one includes all those lines of 
activity commonly occupying the time of a city superintendent, 
then it is practically impossible to get off the subject or in 
twenty minutes catalogue one-half the valuable kinds or lines of 
supervision. 
With these limitations in mind, there must necessarily be 
much omitted or left for the discussion to follow. Supervision 
is both a science and an art. The emphasis has been placed on 
the art and imitation has been the dominant line of activity. 
25
-P-A-G-E-386
  386 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Like the old game, “Simon says wig-wag,” superintendents have 
“performed the operation” after the most approved patterns, 
whether made in Germany, Boston, or Batavia without having 
made the connections between the imported specifics and local 
conditions. 
The science side of supervision needs to be magnified. The 
kind most needed is more scientific. 
The first need of science is facts. No superintendent can 
contribute in any permanent way to the educational betterment 
of the schools of a community unless he be informed in regard 
to the facts; he must know the life in all its phases, the material 
resources, the history and ideals of the community; he must 
know his teachers and pupils and material means of education. 
The first duty of the superintendent is to know the facts. That 
these facts may be valuable, they should be collected and sys- 
tematized in a scientific way. Many superintendents are so 
busy bragging on their schools, their teachers, their school 
board and their own transcendental qualifications to be con- 
tinued in their positions at an increased salary that they have 
no time to collect facts, and probably do not care to know them, 
fearing that the facts might contradict their extravagant claims. 
The spirit of some superintendents, and teachers, too, is to make 
a good showing in spite of the facts. How often have we heard, 
“You need not count that, for it will cut down the average?” 
Every superintendent should, each year, make at least one 
exhaustive study of some one phase of the work under his care. 
This study should be published and put into form, for being 
understood by the lay public of that community. The study 
should be scientific, but the results should be popularized. 
Some superintendents may not know how to make a scientific 
study. These will have to use the method of imitation and do 
over for their community some scientific study made by a uni- 
versity department of education or by some school superintend- 
ent who is trained in the methods of investigation. 
That kind of supervision is needed that magnifies the facts 
and bases wayS and means of improvement of the schools on 
known conditions. Knowing the facts—the things that are— 
the next need is to know the things that ought to be. In the 
second place, then, that kind of supervision is most needed that 
sets up standards—attitudes of mind—and magnifies ideals.
-P-A-G-E-387
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 387 
The superintendent should be a large force in making the educa- 
tional standards and ideals of his community. There 
is a kingdom of these standards and ideals ranging from the 
shape of a pen-point to the ultimate goal of education. His 
greatest enemies are no ideals and standards, or low or wrong 
ideals and standards. He must be an ideal maker. He must 
be the evangelist proclaiming the doctrine if the ideal school 
board, its functions and duties and limitations. He is looked 
to to guide the administrative changes on their educational side. 
He must create the right ideals for his school principals, clearly 
establishing their functions and duties, and giving them the 
measuring rods by which to test their teachers and pupils and 
the whole results of the individual schools. To particularize, 
the kind of supervision needed here is that which gives correct 
notions of what is good teaching, what is good study, what are 
good hygienic conditions, what is a good daily program, what 
is good method of securing order, etc. There is the greatest 
variety in standards, as can be easily shown by requiring a 
group of principals to pass judgment on any set of the above- 
mentioned facts—some principals will rate as excellent what 
should be rates not above fair. 
The ideal teacher, the ideal course of study, the ideal school 
building and equipment, all these ideals and more are sadly 
neded by most communities, and it must be the function of the 
superintendent to eliminate wrong and make over low ideals and 
set the educational pole stars for the community. 
How these ideals are to be established is a most practical and 
pressing problem. It is impossible to set them up like tenpins 
or to accomplish the task in a day, for an educational system 
is an organism and not an aggregate. To establish one ideal 
it becomes necessary to modify many others and change possibly 
the whole system. For purpose of illustrating the way in 
which these ideals may be elevated it becomes necessary to con- 
sider a particular case. Let it be that most important one of 
establishing an ideal of what is good teaching. We shall 
assume that the ideal is low and the concrete problem is before 
the superintendent of inaugurating ways and means of raising 
the standards. Different superintendents will have different 
resources, and so the specific things done may vary with the 
communities, but the general problem is one and the principles 
are the same in all cases.

The beginning of salvation is a consciousness of guilt, so it 
is first necessary to assist the teacher in question to realize that 
her ways are not perfect, and with this act, of necessity, there 
is presented a better way. The means available for aiding in 
the solution of this important problem include the following: 
1. Observation in the model school in connection with the 
city or state normal school. This school should have exempli- 
fied the very best in teaching. Here the normal student sees 
the best, and to this school the teachers should come on their 
visiting days. Days off to visit are absolutely necessary. That 
the visit may be more profitable, the principal of the building 
from which the teacher comes should assist her in planning her 
visit. 
2. Observation of grade teachers of similar grades in other 
buildings. 
3. Model lessons taught by principal or supervisor handling 
the class of the teacher. 
4. Requirements for preparation and plan set by the principal 
or superintendent. 
5. The principals’ semi-annual report to the superintendent 
on the efficiency of their teachers—the points magnified. 
6. Teachers’ meetings and reading of professional books 
under direction of superintendent or principal. 
7. Summer school work with specialist in the branches taught 
and in general pedagogy. 
8. Exchange of teachers between cities and schools. 
9. Exhibits and contests, ete. 
Having a knowledge of the facts—the things that are—and 
knowing the things that ought to be the third, and perhaps 
greatest task of the superintendent, is to make real the ideals 
through working with things that are. Progress is not of the 
mass, but of the individual. While the whole educational sit- 
uation is involved, yet the movement is not uniform. The 
meaning of this is that the superintendent, principal, or teacher 
who would move forward must push forward a point at a time. 
Here I revert to my beginning statements that the varying needs 
of different communities will determine what should be the line 
of the superintendent’s principal endeavor. If buildings are 
wanting, or poor, or if financial support is meager, it may be 
best to work for these material improvements; if the course of
-P-A-G-E-389
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 389 
study is divorced from present-day needs, then the line of effort 
must be to socialize the curriculum, to introduce, maybe, house- 
hold science and art, manual training, and even trade and 
mechanical courses; if standards for teaching are low, another 
superintendent would better work for the appointment of a 
better class of teachers and for the improvement of those in 
service. 
Taking the things that are as stages in the process of devel- 
opment and the ideals as the ever-receding goals, the funda- 
mental thing is growth. -That kind of supervision is needed 
that stimulates, nourishes and directs growth, education is a 
becoming, there are no final stages to the process. On the one 
side the school is the great conserving and conservative institu- 
tion of society. It seeks to bring all to conform to the social 
forms and to preserve the advances of civilization. On the 
other hand, the school is radical in seeking to change the indi- 
vidual from what he is into a more socialized being. The 
school is more of a conservative and habit-forming agency than 
otherwise. The system tends to lose its fluidity and to become 
rigid and its proceses to operate mechanically in grooves. 
While conservatism and habit are essential to progress, yet, at 
the same time, they may be its greatest enemies. 
The superintendent must be a growing superintendent in 
order to stimulate growth in others. He must know the 
psychology of habit, both on the side of how habits are formed 
and how broken. The most imminent perils of all teachers are 
the force of habit and the enchantments of the line of least 
resistance. The normal school sends forth the young teachers 
full of enthusiasm and with lofty and modern ideals, but soon 
the iron hand of the system and the influences of low ideals of 
principal or associates cause her to encyst her normal training 
and revert to the imitation of the methods used in the school 
where she was a pupil in the grades. It is just here that the 
superintendent must come to the rescue and save the young 
teacher from the system. 
The illustration used a while ago in regard to the way to 
establish an ideal of what is good teaching may as well serve 
to illustrate the method of stimulating and directing growth. 
To sum up the discussions, it may be stated that the kind of 
supervision is most needed which seeks to know the facts in a 
 
-P-A-G-E-390

scientific way that sets up the ideals and puts into operation 
ways and means of causing the things that are to grow toward, 
if not into, the things that ought to be. 
“THE KIND OF SUPERVISION MOST NEEDED FOR 
NEGRO SCHOOLS.” 
SUPT. WALKER KING, PALESTINE, TEXAS. 
In order to hedge myself about properly I will state that my 
ancestors, for three generations, have lived in the Southern 
States and have been slave owners. I myself was born in the 
South, attended school in the South only, have worked in the 
South all my life, and expect to vote the Democratic ticket 
until I die. It is my firm conviction that this section of the 
United States must of necessity be governed and absolutely 
controlled forever by the white race. Social equality between 
different races has never existed, can never exist, and will never 
exist. Among the many crimes of the Civil War, the greatest 
was the giving of the right of suffrage to the newly freed and 
ignorant negro. The burden of the negro race is upon our 
shoulders just as the burden of a family rests upon the mother 
and father. In no way can we evade this race problem. No 
matter what the view-point—religious, humanitarian, eco- 
nomic—it still looks us squarely in the face and demands so- 
lution. The South is spending millions upon millions of dol- 
lars upon her negro schools. The burden of this paper is: 
First, we are not getting the greatest returns for our money; 
second, a suggestion as to how these returns may be increased. 
A questionnaire was sent to the superintendents of schools 
in eighty-five of the largest cities and towns in the Southern 
States. Fifty-two more or less complete answers were re- 
turned. From nearly all the larger cities the answers were 
complete. We take it for granted then that they are fairly 
representative of the best educational conditions among the 
negroes. ‘ 
Following is the questionnaire that was sent out: 
Question 1. What is the average number of times per year 
that each negro schoolroom in your city is visited by the super- 
intendent or some other white person in supervisory capacity? 
Question 2. What is the nature of the help or instruction 
given to teachers on these visits?
-P-A-G-E-391
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 391 
Question 3. How much and what is the nature of the super- 
vision done by negro principals or supervisors in the negro 
schools? 
Question 4. Are you in favor of extending and do you be- 
lieve that it would be profitable to extend the scope of super- 
vision of negro principals and supervisors? 
Question 5. What kind of supervision do you think is most 
needed for negro schools? 
Each question will be taken up, one at the time, and the 
tabulated answers given. Question 1: What is the average 
number of times per year that each negro schoolroom in your 
city is visited by the superintendent of some other white per- 
son in a supervisory capacity? Forty answers were given to 
this question, which may be tabulated as follows: 
Seventeen cities, 9 visits or less per room per year. 
Fourteen cities, more than 9 and less than 19 visits per room 
per year. 
Nine cities, more than 18 visits per room per year. 
It is necessary at this point to establish a basis as to the 
minimum number of visits required in order that a supervisor 
may plan the work of a schoolroom and see that these plans 
are carried out. Taking the grades, high and low, we find on 
an average about five studies to the room. One visit per 
month, of a recitation period in length, to each of these studies, 
it seems to me would be the minimum, in order to carry out 
anything like systematic plans. Thus fiorty-five visits per 
room per year would be required as a minimum. Is this an 
unreasonable basis? I leave it to you to answer. If we ac- 
cept this as a reasonable standard, then what must we say of 
the supervision in the school systems whose superintendents 
were kind enough to answer my questions? 
The case that I have tried to make out is, that with the small 
number of visits reported, intelligent white supervision is an 
impossibility. 
In checking up the situation, the next most important item 
is to notice the nature of the answers given to my second ques- 
tion. That second question is: “What is the nature of the 
help or instruction given to teachers on these visits?” Of the 
thirty-seven answers given, twenty-five state that incidental in- 
structions in methods and organization are given, and twelve 
that there is simply inspection or a general checking up.
-P-A-G-E-392
  
3892 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Six of the larger cities report that regular white supervisors 
of special subjects visit more or less frequently the negro 
rooms. Do the answers to question 2 show that there is ade- 
quate white supervision of the negro schools? 
My third question is: “How much and what is the nature 
of the supervision done by negro principals or supervisors in 
the negro schools?” Forty answers were given to this question. 
Nineteen of the larger cities report that they have either negro 
supervisors of instruction or that the principals are required 
to devote all or a part of their time to supervision. Twenty- 
one, generally from the smaller cities, show that negro princi- 
pals teach all of their time and exercise what we might call 
playground or disciplinary supervision. 
The fourth question is: “Are you in favor of extending, and 
do you believe that it would be profitable to extend the scope 
of supervision by negro principals?” Forty-four superintend- 
ents answered this question directly, twenty-nine giving the 
answer “yes” and fifteen the answer “no.” This, practically 
two to one vote, seems tolerably conclusive as an expression 
of opinion. Ags a general proposition, the larger cities voted 
“yes,” and the smaller ones “no.” Some very interesting 
answers were given to this question. These are two of the 
“yes” answers: <A superintendent in a city of about one hun- 
dred thousand population, and a large proportion of it black, 
says: “We do not have the negro supervisions for our colored 
schools, but our reason for not having them is purely financial. 
I believe it would be well to employ a good, strong supervisor 
for our colored schools, and I hope that we can do this before 
long.” The superintendent in another city of fifty or sixty 
thousand says: “This is the only efficient way of making close 
supervision. The principal should have no grade room, pro- 
vided there are eight or ten teachers under his care. His 
whole time should be given to the management of the building, 
the supervision of the teachers, and the care of the property.” 
With few exceptions the “no” answers to question 4 were 
simply “no,” without comment. 
It might be in place to mention that many cautions were 
given by those who favor the extension of negro supervision, 
that only the most competent should be given these places. In 
the majority of answers, however, no apprehension was shown
-P-A-G-E-393
    
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 393 
as to the finding of these supervisors. Without a single ex- 
ception, every superintendent who expressed himself was firm 
in his conviction that the white superintendent should be the 
authoritative head of the negro schools, and keep in close touch 
with them; in fact, no one suggested that the negro schools 
should be completely turned over to negro principals. It is 
urged in a number of answers that an intelligent negro prin- 
cipal can and does understand the conditions that obtain 
among his own people better than a white man can. If we 
employ negro teachers to teach negro children, why not have 
these teachers supervised by one of their own race? If no 
Southern white man wants to teach a negro school, why should 
he want to supervise negro teachers? If called upon to make 
a candid confession, many superintendents will admit that 
they, in the rush of other matters, neglect more or less the 
negro schools. I for one make this confession and plead 
guilty. Many of the answers given insist that negro schools 
need more and closer supervision than the white schools. The 
truth of this is readily seen. Any one who is at all acquainted 
with the situation knows that the preparation of many negro 
teachers is very crude. Their methods are as crude as their 
professional training has been. To let many of them go with- 
out the closest supervision means that their salaries are totally 
wasted in the inefficiency of instruction. Notwithstanding 
the crudeness of the masses of the teachers, it is the experi- 
ence of almost every superintendent that where he has as 
many as ten or a dozen teachers he will find one or more of 
superior efficiency. With a very small additional salary you 
can secure your supervising principal from these efficient ones. 
In question 5 I submitted to every one the subject of this 
paper in the form of a question, viz: “What kind of supervi- 
sion do you think is most needed for negro schools?” A ma- 
jority of the answers to this question were worthless insofar 
as their use in the paper is concerned. Thirteen of these 
answers, however, are made the concrete suggestion that the 
scope of supervision of negro principals be extended; four 
others answered in a positive way that “white supervision” is 
what is needed for negro schools. Two of these answers are 
well worth quoting: 
“TI believe that the supervision of well-equipped negroes will 
 
-P-A-G-E-394
    394 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
be most efficient and helpful for the reasons mentioned in 
question 4.” One of these reasons mentioned I will quote, 
notwithstanding the fact that the same idea has been pre- 
viously advanced. The reason is: “His (referring to the 
negro principal in general) knowledge of negro teachers, negro 
pupils, and negro patrons, is more thorough than any white 
man’s can ever be. Efficient negro supervision of the negro 
schools require a more intimate knowledge of and contact 
with negroes than a white superintendent can get or than 
public opinion will allow him to get. And I feel that the 
white superintendent can do his best work through a negro 
principal who has sense enough to employ the best of his sug- 
gestions and leave out those not usable among negroes.” 
The next answer comes from a superintendent in one of the 
oldest and most aristocratic of Southern towns. It is truly 
typical and describes the conditions in which many superin- 
tendents work. But to quote the answer in question: It is 
said, “Of course one feature would be regular teachers’ meet- 
ings, in which the superintendent could outline plans for the 
teachers to follow, and then see, from day to day, that these 
plans were carried out. This however, would presuppose much 
closer supervision than the average superintendent could de- 
vote to the negro. I have eleven schools in all, three of which 
are colored. You can easily see that I could only afford to 
devote a good part of my time to the negro by neglecting the 
white schools, and that is a thing my people would not stand 
for a minute.” This superintendent could get an efficient 
negro supervisor, talk to him in the office one or two hours per 
week, visit each negro room once a month, and revolutionize 
conditions in his negro schools. 
In addition to the general questionnaire sent out to the 
superintendents, questions 4 and 5 were submitted to twelve 
presidents of the leading Southern universities and colleges, 
and also to twelve of the State superintendents of Southern 
States. Eight of the college men answered question 4, five of 
them favoring the extension of negro supervision, one opposing 
it, and two non-committal. I will quote as typical the answers 
from one of these college men who has had large experience 
also in public school work. “I am in favor of extending the 
scope of supervision of negro schools by negro principals. As
-P-A-G-E-395
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 395 
a rule the principal of a negro school is engaged continuously 
in teaching, no time being left for supervision. This is a 
weakness not only in schools for negroes, but in schools for 
white children. In the school system of a very large city it 
may be advisable to have a negro serve as supervisor of the 
negro schools, but he should be an assistant superintendent 
acting under the control and direction of the superintendent, 
who will be, of course, a gentleman of Caucasian decent.” 
Of the twelve State superintendents to whom this question 
was submitted five answered, “Yes;” three, “No,” and two 
for reasons refused to answer. This is a sample of one of the 
“no” answers, “In my opinion any extension of the supervision 
of negro schools by negro principals is undesirable. The negro 
must constitute the peasant class in the South, and any 
attempt to train him along other lines will destroy his use- 
fulness and deprive him of the opportunity to work. His 
education should be of such a character as to fit him for 
intelligent service in the trades. If his training seeks in any 
respect to confer social, political, or industrial equality with 
the whites, such training will not be approved by the people 
who must dominate this section of the country. Education 
cannot remove the inferiority of the negro race, and the hal- 
lucination leading many people to make the school the open 
sesame to all vocations for the darky would be laughable if 
it were not pitiable. Any education that unfits the negro to 
recognize the superiority of the white man and obey his orders 
causes friction between the races, awakens impossible aspira- 
tions in the negro, and unfits him for the honest and honorable 
work open to him in the South.” 
This is one of the five “yes” answers from a State superin- 
tendent of instruction in one of the Gulf States: “In answer 
to your first question you will permit me to say that I am in 
favor of the supervision of negro schools, as far as may be 
practible, by negro principals. I favor this proposition for the 
reason, the white principals and superintendents, as a rule, do 
not have sufficient time to devote to the supervision of negro 
schools, practically all their time being demanded by the white 
schools. 
“In this part of the country I think it will be a long time 
before the white superintendents and principals will devote
-P-A-G-E-396
  396 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
much of their time to supervising the negro schools, and it 
seems to me that it would be both wise and profitable to pro- 
vide for the supervision of negro schools by capable and relia- 
ble negro principals and supervisors. In the work of super- 
vision of negro schools the negro principal or supervisor 
should be under the direction and supervision of the white 
superintendent, thus giving the benefit of the judgment and 
experience of the white superintendent to the negro schools 
through the medium of a negro principal or supervisor.” 
The efforts of this paper have been directed toward condi- 
tions that exist in city schools. The negro rural schools are 
practically without supervision of any kind. A negro super- 
visor should be employed for about every twenty rooms in all 
counties in the black belt. By this method practically every 
school could be visited one day in each month. 
Summary.—I have tried to show in this paper that at pres- 
ent the direct white supervision of negro schools is inadequate ; 
second, that the logical method of remedy consists in extend- 
ing the scope of supervision of negro principals and super- 
visors under the direct and immediate management of the 
white superintendent. 
KIND OF SUPERVISION MOST NEDED. 
SUPT. J. H. BRIGHT, PORT ARTHUR, TEXAS. 
To my mind the question, “Kind of Supervision Most Needed,” 
is specific, and suggests that some field of supervision is being 
neglected, or that we should concentrate our efforts more upon 
some feature of the work. 
We have just had two excellent papers and a splendid dis- 
cussion of supervision, but who of us can now tell the Kinp oF 
Supervision Most Neepep? I can agree with almost every 
remark that has been made in regard to supervision, both in 
white schools and in colored schools, but I desire to emphasize 
particularly that part of the last paper dealing with industrial 
training in the colored schools. 
To my mind, the time and money spent in giving to the colored 
schools a classic course, or any course whose paramount purpose 
is culture, is time and money wasted. I believe that the negro 
should be trained to do honest and efficient labor, to become 
expert “hewers of wood and drawers of water,” leaving for a 
thousand years the field of the classics.
-P-A-G-E-397
  
JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 397 
It appears to me that the kind of supervision most needed is 
not along the line of the usual work of the superintendent; the 
course of study, rules and regulations, laws and their execution, 
selection of teachers, direction of teaching, raising qualifications 
of teachers, and securing better school accommodations. 
These things are neglected by no superintendent. The course 
of study, what we are teaching and how we are teaching it, is 
the foundation topic of most of our meetings, and I would not 
yield to any one in rendering to these topics their just meed of 
importance and consideration. The superintendent must be in 
touch with the facts of his business and have the ability to meet 
those personal conditions that are sure to arise. 
In my opinion, Mr. Chairman, the superintendent may do all 
the work that I have outlined, he may have the facts and all 
knowledge in regard to his course of study and yet his work not 
be a success because he lacks one thing. And this brings me to 
the kind of supervision that I believe is most needed, Epuca- 
TIONAL LEADERSHIP. 
Keeping harmony, adjusting the machinery of his system, 
keeping alive that spiritual life without which there is no edu- 
cation, touching hands with the people, the school board, the 
teachers and the children, is the supervision most needed. 
He is a good superintendent who can lead people and school 
boards to his ideals and leave with them the idea that they are 
directing, in a large measure, the affairs of school life them- 
selves. 
Behind every movement for better school boards, more ideal 
conditions under which teaching can be done, must be a live 
superintendent. 
In this field of supervision, the public must be attracted to 
the schools and their needs. Not merely attract attention to 
the schools, but attract attention to the support of the schools. 
If the superintendent would study his people a little more, 
get a little nearer their lives and ideals, he would be able to 
serve them more efficiently. 
The superintendent should cease to be a worshiper of organ- 
ization, machinery, plans and devices, rules and formulas, and 
become a discoverer of human beings, become a fisher of men. 
In conclusion, allow me to repeat that educational leadership 
is the need of the hour, and that the man who can fill the place 
would make a splendid ambassador to any king’s court.

EFFICIENT SUPERVISION. 
SUPT. W. L. HUGHES, SAN ANGELO, TEXAS. 
The subject which I am to discuss is the most vital one that 
is at the present time engaging the attention of the school 
people of the South. The rural school problem is the problem 
of the hour. Fully 70 per cent of the population of the South 
is rural. This I believe is a conservative estimate. The ques- 
tion of giving these boys and girls advantages equal, or ap- 
proximately equal, to those of the city is the problem of the 
South. We have made a statement of the problem but have 
not solved it. 
In my discussion I shall use Texas as a type, believing that 
she has as good schools, or nearly as good, as any of the 
Southern States. This may not be true, but my limited time 
for investigation has not taught me otherwise; so if I do not 
give some of our sister States a square deal, remember it is 
through ignorance of their real conditions, etc. 
I believe that the most vital question connected with any 
business is the one of supervision. No man would undertake 
to spend the modest sum of fifteen or twenty thousand dollars 
in the construction of a house without an expert supervisor. 
The man who spend his money must know that his supervisor 
is competent to see that nothing is wasted and that the work 
is good. He must see that every workman who applies for 
a job on the building is competent, and that everything is 
carried on in a business like manner. These same business 
methods should control our rural schools. We are all witness 
to the fact that these methods do not obtain in our rural 
schools. Not half of the counties in Texas have any kind of 
supervision whatever, and very few of these counties that do 
have supervision have the competent supervision they should 
have. The people are not yet awake to the necessity of super- 
vision, and every condition is against the country boy and 
girl. To state the case in a few words, the country schools 
have the shortest terms, the poorest houses, very few libraries, 
almost no equipment, inefficient teachers, and poor super- 
vision; therefore, what can be expected of the country boy and 
girl? All honor the boy or girl who rises in spite of these 
conditions and takes the lead among his or her fellow citizens.
-P-A-G-E-399
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 399 
I sincerely believe that there is no good reason why the rural 
schools should be behind the city schools if they are managed 
on a business basis. What can be expected of a county super- 
intendent under the present conditions? If his county has 
seventy-five districts, he has seventy-five sets of incompetent 
trustees to deal with—trustees “to most of whom,” to quote 
Jas. P. Munroe, in Popular Science Monthly, “the problems of 
education are as remote as the wisdom of Confucius.” He has 
seventy-five school systems to deal with, and the very best 
he can do, under present conditions, is to visit these schools 
about once or twice a year. He is not allowed to select his 
teachers, so how can he be held responsible for their work? 
A teacher may be ever so incompetent, but it takes a decision 
of the State board of education to decide the matter. Again, 
the county superintendent is elected by the people who exer- 
cise the same discretion in their selection of him as they would 
a sheriff or any other county officer, and in Texas, the un- 
written law is that no man shall eat at the political pie- 
counter longer than two terms, or four years. He should be 
wealthy enough in four years to retire and live on the interest 
of his money the remainder of his days. These are some of 
the conditions that confront county supervision, and add to 
them the magnificent salary paid the Texas county superin- 
tendents and a political campaign every two years and you see 
at once the impossibility of securing efficient rural school 
supervisors. These conditions must be changed if the rural 
schools are to make any improvement. I believe that the com- 
mon school districts should be united under one board of 
trustees. This board to select the supervisor and fix his salary, 
also furnish him with means of travel. There is no further 
excuse for a county superintendent to be traveling over his 
county in a buggy; let the county board furnish him with an 
automobile so that only a small fraction of his time will be 
spent on the road and so that he can be at home at night with 
his family. Let this board reach out after the best men in 
the country regardless of whether he be a citizen of their 
country of not, and pay him a salary that will get the very 
best men. A city superintendent has smooth sailing as com- 
pared with a county superintendent, yet Texas says that a 
county superintendent is worth only $1,500 a year, while the 
 
-P-A-G-E-400
  400 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
salaries of city superintendents in Texas go as high as $4,000 
per year. This is an unfair and unjust discrimination against 
the rural school children of Texas. 
I would have this board, upon the recommendation of the 
county superintendent, select the teachers of the county and 
fix their salaries, build and repair school houses, consolidate 
weak schools, establish high schools, furnish transportation for 
the children to reach these high schools—in fact bring the 
rural schools under some sort of system. The three-trustee- 
district system will never succeed in securing a high standard 
of efficiency. They have no system, no policy and no houses 
fit for school purposes, nor can they be made to see the need 
of these things. The rural schools of Texas are today prac- 
tically where they were twenty years ago, while the city 
schools under business management are making rapid prog- 
ress. Millions of dollars are being absolutely wasted on the 
rural schools, all for the want of business management. Not 
only are we wasting money, but we are doing worse; we are 
permitting the country boys and girls to grow up in ignorance 
and superstition, a menace to the perpetuity of liberty and free 
government. 
Under present conditions, what is expected of a county 
superintendent? My answer is: Everything. He is not fur- 
nished with any clerical help, and is, therefore, expected to be 
in his office attending to clerical duties and visiting schools 
all at the same time. The Texas statutes say that the county 
superintendent must visit schools four days in every week. 
If his only means of travel is a horse and buggy, the chances 
are that it will not be possible for him to comply with the 
law because of bad weather. Again, the rural people in many 
counties are unfriendly to any sort of supervision, because 
many rural teachers do not want a superintendent interferring 
with their work. My experience as a county superintendent 
has taught me that the rural people need experts to supervise 
their schools. A man must be able to mingle with the country 
people; must be able to inspire confidence in his ability; must 
pursue constructive policies; must know school architecture; 
must know the price of lumber, school furniture, etc.; must 
know how and where to purchase these things; must know how 
to build a school house with ventilation and plenty of light;
-P-A-G-E-401
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 401 
must be able to show the people the necessity of such things; 
must be able to show the people the necessity of better school 
houses and better school conditions; must be willing to go 
in any kind of weather; must be able to talk to his people on 
school questions so as to make them see the need of education. 
These are some of the things he must be able to do outside of 
his professional work. The professional side of the work needs 
a man of scholarship; a man of experience in all kinds of 
schools, from the rural school to the city high school. If a 
supervisor’s ideals are not above the rural school, he sees 
nothing to improve, and is willing to drift along from year 
to year, doing nothing more than trying to hold his job. A 
supervisor must know how to get the very best work out of 
the raw material given him as a teaching force. If he had a 
voice in the selection of his teachers, he might and could im- 
prove his teaching force; since he has no such power, he must 
be with his schools as often as possible to instruct and assist 
his teachers in systematizing their work. A large majority of 
the teachers of the rural schools are beginners and wholly 
incompetent, so he must take these things in consideration 
so as to place his help where most needed. He has a com- 
paratively new set of teachers to deal with each year, as the 
rural teachers shift from pillar to post each year seeking better 
conditions and better wages. These conditions must be 
remedied before a supervisor’s work can become effective. 
In addition to being a man of scholarship and experience, 
a supervisor should be a man of infinite tact or his people 
will lose confidence in him. Having no board of trustees upon 
which to rely, he must be careful. No revolutionary measures 
“must be introduced, but he must seek to improve the condi- 
tions gradually, and he must remember that he has to educate 
his partons to new ideas and new conditions. He must remem- 
ber that the ignorant man is the one most jealous of his rights 
and suspicious of the other man’s actions. I have never seen 
statistics on what per cent of the farmers of the South have 
even as much as a high school education, but am of the opinion 
that it is disgracefully low, yet our forefathers declared in 
the Declaration of Independence of Texas that, “It is an axiom 
of political science that, unless a people are educated and en- 
lightened, it is idle to expect the continuance of civil liberty 
26
-P-A-G-E-402
  402 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
or the capacity for self-government.” A county superin- 
tendent must therefore realize what a great responsibility 
rests upon him; he must have the missionary spirit, and try 
to forget that his remuneration is not sufficient to enable him 
to live in a respectable manner. 
I do not know what the conditions are in other States, but 
I do know that in Texas the legal qualifications of a county 
superintendent are a mere travesty—a first-grade certificate 
alone qualifies a man to hold the office. This in addition to 
being a political office makes it an easy prey for political 
office-seekers of the incompetent type. There is no chance of 
promotion and no increase in salary and the better class of 
school people look upon a man who holds the office as a man 
who is a political trickster. If the county board selected the 
county superintendent and were allowed to select a man from 
any county or State, strictly from the standpoint of qualifica- 
tions and were allowed to fix his salary, then the incompetent 
man would be driven from the ranks and the competent man 
would have a chance to be promoted from one county to a 
wealthier county where he could secure an increase in salary. 
Not only would this be true, but-the county board would 
quickly recognize the competent man’s ability and retain him 
year after year. The distasteful political campaign would thus 
be avoided and the county superintendent would be on the same 
basis with the city superintendent. Not only would this induce 
better men and women to seek the office of county superin- 
tendent, but I believe it would be only a short time until the 
rural people would become more friendly toward supervision, 
from the fact that they would get more competent men and 
feel the need of it. 
In too many counties in Texas the people would entirely 
abolish the office of county superintendent if they had a chance. 
They consider the man who holds the office a parasite, and 
often ask what are his duties, and what is the need of such 
an officer who does nothing and gets part of the money their 
children need to help along in their schooling. These are un- 
healthy conditions and must be remedied. The only remedy 
I can offer is to get more competent officers, thereby raising the 
standard of efficiency so that the superintendent’s influence 
can be felt. In passing, I cannot resist the temptation of say-
-P-A-G-E-403
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 403 
ing that I do not believe that young and inexperienced teachers 
should be permitted to go out and practice on the rural chil- 
dren, where conditions are more complex than in the city. Yet 
the city trustees guard against this very thing by requiring 
a higher standard of efficiency in the way of experience and 
education. This State, as other Southern States, must provide 
more training schools for teachers and require a higher stand- 
ard of efficiency in order to guard the rural children against 
the present conditions. Whenever this is done we will see the 
teachers’ work become more remunerative. We are constantly 
agitating the question of higher wages for teachers. I believe 
school people of all classes are underpaid, but I further believe 
that we will have to raise the standard of efficiency of the 
average teacher before we can hope for much increase in wages. 
We must not forget that the competent teachers are forced to 
compete with the incompetent ones; especially is this true of 
the rural schools where there is no standard of efficiency and 
where business methods do not obtain. 
Possibly you think by this time that I am a chronic kicker, 
but I am not. I have stated the case just as it is, and have 
offered some suggestions and plans for bettering conditions. 
When we take in consideration how few country teachers ever 
attend these conventions and how few county superintendents 
are ever placed on the programs, it is almost safe to conclude 
that most of you people do not know the real conditions in the 
rural communities. We meet in our State teachers’ associa- 
tions and discuss school conditions relative to the city school 
systems and almost forget that more than six hundred thou- 
sand of the nine hundred thousand school children in Texas 
are in the rural schools. The county superintendent alone 
cannot build up an efficient system of rural schools. He must 
have help. He may be ever so able a man—and Texas has 
her quota of good county superintendents—but he must fail 
and become discouraged under the present lack of system. Give 
him a board of trustees to deal with instead of the ignorant, 
miserly and unfriendly commissioners’ courts; let him have a 
voice in the selection of his teachers; give him longer terms in 
office, provided he is competent; give him better wages; let him 
have a voice in constructing and equipping better school houses 
and in consolidating weak schools. In large counties let him   
   
-P-A-G-E-404
404 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
divide his county into several districts with assistant super- 
visors. It is a physical impossibility for one man to supervise 
from one hundred to one hundred and fifty schools located in 
the several parts of his county. One visit of possibly one-half 
day is all he can do in the entire school year, and such super- 
vision amounts to little. Furthermore, we can never have 
efficient one-teacher schools so long as the one teacher is re- 
quired to attempt all the work from the primary grades up to 
and including the high school grades no matter what kind of 
supervision we may have. When consolidation comes, when we 
can establish the five and six-teacher school in the rural dis- 
trict, then, and not until then, can the supervisor’s work be- 
come really effective. Not only must we consolidate, but we 
must have compulsory education. A supervisor can expect very 
little of a teacher who has a poor school house with no equip- 
ment and a very irregular attendance. All of these conditions 
make efficient supervision almost impossible. 
For fear of being called a pessimist, I want to say that in 
Texas the signs are good. Texas has recently passed a high 
school law, which, when properly amended, will become a great 
factor toward improvement. This law also creates a county 
school board. This is a long step in the right direction. I be- 
lieve the next generation will see a great development of the 
rural school system of the South. Along with her material and 
industrial development, I believe we will see the rural school 
brought up to the point where they will meet the needs of the 
people. I believe that rural school supervision will be brought 
up to the standard of the city schools. These things can be 
done by putting the rural schools on a business basis. As long 
as a county superintendent has to make a dirty, political cam- 
paign to secure and hold his job, just so long will the better 
and more competent class of school men and women pass the 
office up as undesirable. These things can and will be remedied 
in the near future. 
EFFICIENT CITY SUPERVISION. 
SUPT. J. A. BROOKS, DALLAS, TEXAS. 
Efficient supervision of a city school comes from and through 
the efforts, guidance, direction and leadership of an efficient 
city superintendent. An efficient superintendent is more born  
-P-A-G-E-405
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 405 
than made. His inherent qualities are of far more importance 
and of far deeper significance than are his acquired qualifica- 
tions. It is always assumed and generally understood that the 
superintendent is a scholar; that he is a gentleman; that he is 
a leader; and that he is not only well versed in, but is a past 
master of the necessary details of supervision. These assump- 
tions must be true or the very foundation on which a system of 
supervision rests is defective. Upon and out of these basic 
principles may be built a system of which any man may be 
proud, and of which any city may justly boast. A superstruc- 
ture resting upon these fundamental principles will be efficient 
and successful in proportion to the number of human virtues 
possessed by the superintendent, and in proportion to his 
judicious and correct employment of these virtues. If super- 
vision is a success it must be impregnated, and permeated, and 
saturated with such virtues as truth, honesty, justice, fairness, 
sincereity, kindness, reasonableness, liberality, sociability, pa- 
tience, faith, hope, charity, love and common sense. 
Truth must be exemplified in the lives of the superintendent 
and his co-workers. Truth must be sought. Truth must be 
taught. Truth must be insisted upon. Truth must be one of 
the shining stars in the great galaxy of human virtues, giving 
light and strength and help in the solution of all problems of 
school government. It must be so apparent in the superin- 
tendent that it is taken as a matter of course and never ques- 
tioned in his plans and suggestions and recommendations. If 
a great system of schools is to succeed, honesty must be one of 
the great watchwords in the conduct of its affairs. Honesty 
is the best policy in school management as well as in all things 
else. It is not only to be expected but is to be demanded and 
insisted upon until it is observed by all. Nothing short of it 
should satisfy any one either interested in or connected with 
school work. Above all, the honesty of the actions and inten- 
tions of the superintendent should be so obvious that no sus- 
picion even should ever attach to him. 
The city superintendent who is able to recognize and prop- 
erly dispense justice is the man to work out the most efficient 
system of supervision. Justice—common justice to all—in a 
large system of schools is an ever-present perplexing problem. 
It is eminently desirable; it is persistently sought; it seems
-P-A-G-E-406
  406 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
hopelessly unattainable in many instances. It cannot be side- 
tracked; it should not be ignored; and it must not be per- 
verted. Its cries are irrepressible; its pleas are incontrover- 
tible; and its demands are eminently commendable. Nothing 
confronts the busy superintendent quite so often as the ques- 
tion of justice. It bobs up on all occasions. It reaches the 
superintendent through many mediums—in person, by proxy, 
by letter, over the telephone, through the telegram. This ques- 
tion arises in every department, and insists upon an immediate 
answer. The success or failure of any school man’s plans de- 
pends very largely upon the correctness or incorrectness of his 
verdicts in dealing out justice. If he is right in his decisions 
he succeeds. If he errs, he fails to the extent of his error. 
Justice under the name of fairness is best known to the child 
and appeals to him early in life. It is recognized and insisted 
upon by children even before they enter school. If properly 
nurtured, it grows in its beauty and develops in its splendor 
as the child grows. After entering upon his school life he 
soon decides in his own mind whether his teacher, his principal 
or his superintendent is fair. It is a happy situation when 
fair dealing is recognized and observed by the pupils, parents, 
teachers, principals, superintendents and members of the board 
of education. When this condition exists and is daily exem- 
plified by the superintendent and when he is generally known 
as its chief exponent and advocate, then it is that city super- 
vision is on the high road to efficiency. Fairness is the panacea 
for many school ailments. It satisfies the wronged child. It 
soothes the angry parent. It calms the disturbed teacher. It 
allays the suspicions of the principal. It dispels the apprehen- 
sions of the superintendent. It gives confidence to the public. 
~ Sincerity is another gem among the virtues of men that must 
be advocated and employed by school people. It must be mag- 
nified in order that sham, deceit, hypocrisy and certain other 
evils may be minified. It should be commended and encour- 
aged in order that its resplendence may attract, and that its 
value may be emphasized. Sincerity should characterize every 
act of learning, every act of teaching, every act of school gov- 
ernment, and every act of supervision. Supervision without 
sincerity vitalizing is as sure to fail as it is attempted. It 
must be a potent factor in every effort put forth to evolve 
and maintain an efficient system.
-P-A-G-E-407
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 407 
Kindness in school management is an indispensable principle, 
the efficacy of which cannot be gainsaid. By its employment 
the board will éndorse any reasonable recommendation of the 
superintendent. Put to the proper use the greatest interest 
may be roused in the principal, and his best efforts and noblest 
purposes may be called forth for service in furthering and up- 
building and perfecting the school system. Kindness toward 
the tired and care-worn teacher who bears the brunt of the 
battle; who sometimes uncomplainingly carries a load taxing 
her strength to the limit; who in some instances is crowded to 
the point of surrendering her charge; will restore her spirit, 
will revive her strength, will put new hope and new life into 
her very existence. Kindness is a strengthening tonic, a bouy- 
ant agent, and an exhilerating force that will win in every con- 
ceivable detail of school work. One of the greatest pleasures 
in school supervision is to make people happy, thereby placing 
them in an attitude to do the greatest good to the greatest 
number. Kindness, judiciously used, especially by superiors in 
office, will insure certain indispensable results which cannot be 
secured by school authorities in any other manner. There 
should be a good and valid reason at command for all the acts 
and doings of the superintendent. The reasonableness of his 
recommendations, his instructions and his requirements should 
be apparent at all times. If good reasons can be given, rough 
places in school government may be made smooth. If the why 
of certain requests is clear and unquestioned, these requests 
will be cheerfully obeyed. If the wherefore of the superin- 
tendent’s intentions to inaugurate even something new and 
novel in school work is sufficiently elucidated and conclusively 
shown to be a necessity, very little opposition will ensue. 
Reasonableness is that salt that saves the situation and per- 
petuates the vantage ground already gained. 
Liberality must not be overlooked or belittled in institut- 
ing or carrying on a system of efficient supervision. There 
are many roads leading to Houston. There are many methods 
whereby the same end in education may be reached. There 
are many ways of accomplishing the same results. No two 
principals manage their schools the same way. No two teach- 
ers can teach the same class in the same manner. Since we 
are not created equal or alike, we must be liberal in our
-P-A-G-E-408
    408 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
expectations and requirements of teachers. A reasonably 
liberal management will create less friction, will preserve the 
teacher’s individuality and will give sufficient scope to many 
most excellent teachers whose usefulness is destroyed when 
hampered by any kind of narrow system. 
Sociability is a necessary factor in the successful manage- 
ment of teachers. Many teachers do not like one another be- 
cause of some trivial matter which could be adjusted in a few 
minutes. Teachers are often heard to say, “I did not like her at 
first, but since I know her better I like her very much.” One of 
the problems in supervision will be largely solved when teach- 
ers learn to know one another better. It is worth while for 
teachers to get together as often as possible in a social way 
and cultivate one another. They are working together in a 
common cause to a common end. The superintendent himself 
should be an affable gentleman. His social qualities should be 
such as to make his teachers feel at perfect ease when in his 
office, or when he visits their school rooms. He should know 
his teachers and they should know him, if school supervision 
is to be most efficient. 
Patience as a virtue in school supervision is an inestimable 
agent. A superintendent without an enormous stock of pa- 
tience is sure to fail. He is daily put to the test. The tests 
come from as many sources as there are necessary details in 
the management of a great school plant. As is his patience, 
so will the patience of all with whom he comes in contact be. 
His success is very largely measured by his patience. Most 
superintendents, who fail, fail because they cannot manage 
people, and they are unable to manage people because they 
have no patience with them. Since the great first need of a 
city superintendent is for people, and since the great first 
purpose of school supervision is for people, and since people 
are always interested in what they own, and since the schools 
belong to the people, it follows that the chief business of the 
superintendent is dealing with people and that one of the 
chief requisites in properly handling them is patience. Pa- 
tience then becomes a necessity in school management. 
If city superintendents succeed they must do it largely 
through faith. In a large school system it is impossible to 
know all of what is being done and all about how certain work 
 
-P-A-G-E-409
JOURNAL OF PROOEEDINGS. 409 
       
    
                                           
    
                  
   
     
              
     
      is being done. Able assistants must be employed and then 
the superintendent must pin his faith to them. They must 
know and feel that school authorities believe in them and have 
the utmost confidence in them. Without faith in one another 
any attempt at any kind of school work is more or less a 
failure. Hope is one of the strongest and most useful stimu- 
lants to all school work. It leads on to greater effort and to 
nobler purposes. It is the buoyant agent which helps the 
weak, uplifts the dispirited; adds strength to the already 
strong, and gives promise of reward to all. The poor teacher 
hopes to be a better one. The good teacher hopes to have his 
salary raised. The poor principal hopes to be promoted. The 
good principal hopes to succeed the present superintendent. 
This is just as it should be. It is the business of the super- 
intendent to so manage his school people that their hopes will 
always be reaching out for something higher, nobler and 
better. 
Charity cannot be left out of a successful school adminis- 
tration. The superintendent who practices it himself, and 
encourages it in others, is not only doing good on earth, but 
is laying up treasures in heaven. Not one of us approaches 
perfection. Teachers are human, therefore they err. Be chari- 
tably inclined toward the teacher, or principal, or superin- 
tendent who makes a mistake. Brand him not as a failure, but 
kindly overlook his fault and help him to be a success. It is 
a lamentable fact that there are too many in the teaching 
fraternity who emphasize their self-importance and stress their 
superiority. Such persons, as a class, are uncharitable, and 
will mar the unity, spoil the harmony, impede the progress 
and ruin the efficiency of any system of schools, if allowed to 
continue in the error of their way. But a superintendent who 
is known to be kind and sympathetic and magnanimous and 
charitable and fearless can remedy this evil in one of two 
ways, either of which will be a charitable act on his part. He 
can reform the offender within the ranks, or he can recom- 
mend and secure his dismissal from service. Either of these 
steps will improve the efficiency of the system. 
We are enjoined in holy writ to love one another and to 
love our neighbors as we love ourselves. In no other institu- 
tion under Heaven should this injunction be more religiously
-P-A-G-E-410
  410 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
obeyed than in the school. When the children love their 
teachers, the teachers love their pupils, the teachers love their 
principal, the principal loves his teachers, the principals love 
their superintendent and the superintendent loves his prin- 
cipals, his teachers and his pupils, then do we have a school 
system in the right attitude to perform the high office for 
which it was instituted. Teaching is largely a labor of love. 
The smaller the number of people connected with the school 
who do not have an ardent love for humanity, the better it is 
for the school. The greater the love we have for one another 
and one another’s success, and for the system’s success, the 
more perfect will our supervision be. All the knowledge of all 
the ages crammed into the cranium of a superintendent avails 
but little if he is short on common sense. Sheepskins, and 
degrees, and titles, and honors, and scholarship, without com- 
mon sense will just about as definitely determine the course a 
superintendent will pursue as will the course of a rudderless 
ship in mid-ocean be determined. Common sense must enter 
into the course of study, into the selection of teachers, into 
the assignment of teachers, into the general management of 
teachers, into the rules and regulations, into the superin- 
tendent’s recommendations, in fact into every act of the super- 
intendent. Its proper exercise in employing many of the 
factors heretofore mentioned will determine the potency of 
those factors. If these forces are overworked; if they are in- 
judiciously applied; if they are improperly stressed; if they 
are unduly emphasized, or if they are intentionally or unin- 
tentionally perverted, failure and disappointment will in- 
evitably follow. Common sense as one of the chief qualifica- 
tions of the superintendent endows him with poise, good judg- 
ment and correct decisions. The city superintendent, then, in 
my judgment, who possesses to the highest degree the greatest 
number of cardinal virtues and is able to most judiciously use 
them is the superintendent who presides over the most effi- 
cient system of city schools.

NOMIC AND MATERIAL DEVELOPMENT OF 
THE STATE. 
ALEXANDER DEUSSEN, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, 
Mr. President, Members of the Southern Educational Associa- 
tion and Fellow Citizens: 
Limitations of time will of necessity prevent anything like 
an adequate discussion of the subject assigned to this speaker. 
So important a topic can be viewed from so many angles that 
it would tire your patience to attempt anything like a full 
presentation. I have, therefore, selected one line of thought 
by way of illustrating how the university is aiding in the 
material development of the State which thought I would be 
glad to leave with you on this occasion. 
We, of this State, who know its history, its resources and its 
conditions, are profoundly impressed with fact that here, as 
elsewhere, a number of problems urgently press for solution. 
It is a fact unfortunately true that here industrial and eco- 
nomic conditions lack much of being ideal. It is a fact that 
our agriculture, which is our basic industry, is not in an en- 
 
-P-A-G-E-412
  412 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
tirely prosperous condition, notwithstanding the idle com- 
ments of ill-informed writers in the newspapers and popular 
magazines. We, who are familiar at first hand with these 
and other conditions, and we, who have attempted to diagnose 
these conditions, know that no single thing will more effec- 
tively minister to the material welfare of this people than the 
establishment of a manufacturing industry, an industry 
whereby the products of our farms will be converted without 
the gross economic waste now attendant in the way of costly 
transportation charges both to and from the factory, now over 
fifteen hundred miles removed from the source of the raw 
material. We conceive that with the establishment of factories 
—cotton mills to convert our chief product, steel mills to 
utilize our stores of iron, clay burning establishments to utilize 
our stores of clay—we conceive that in this way we will build 
cities, towns, consuming centers where now only small towns 
and struggling villages exist; we will stimulate the building 
of railroad lines and electric interurbans to facilitate the 
movements of raw materials and finished products; we will 
establish a market, and will bring producer and consumer in 
close communication with each other with mutual benefit to 
both. In this way, and in this way only, can we hope to 
establish that diversification in our agricultural industry 
which it is universally admitted is the only ultimate solution 
for our present agricultural depression. It is idle to expect 
the farmer to raise vegetables and fruits and hogs and corn 
and other things that he might raise or prepare to raise in 
place of cotton, if he possessed a place in which these things 
could be marketed at a price that would repay him for his 
labor and leave him a small profit on his investment. When 
we build a consuming center, and not until then, will we 
emancipate him from his present bondage to cotton, for under 
present industrial conditions prevailing in this State, it is the 
only thing which it is practicable to raise as a crop for mar- 
ket, the animadversions in the popular press to the contrary 
notwithstanding. 
It is probably true that the most potent drawback—it is 
not the only one, however—that retards this development is 
the lack of an adequate fuel supply which will furnish cheap 
power. Texas is blessed with a vast store of raw material—
-P-A-G-E-413
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 413 
its wealth of soil, underground water, clay, stone and iron 
is stupendous—but the single item lacking in this galaxy of 
nature’s stores is (or rather has been) fuel. Our streams, 
unfortunately under present conditions, unlike those of New 
England and the Piedmont States, are not harnessed with 
comparative simplicity at low cost, and made to do duty in 
the mills in place of coal. Neither can this State boast of 
coal supplies comparable to those of Pennsylvania. 
It is only during the last few years that it has been possible 
to secure anything like cheap fuel in this State at prices suf- 
ficiently low to enable factories to meet the competition of 
those more favorably situated as respects this important item. 
It is only since the discoveries of the gas fields at Caddo in 
Louisiana, and at Henrietta and Laredo in Texas—discoveries 
made within the last four years—that cheap fuel has become 
a reality, but this so far is only in isolated spots. We hope 
through the investigations which the University is directly 
and indirectly fostering to materially enlarge these areas of 
favorable condtions. In much the greater portion of Texas 
high cost of fuel in addition to lack of transportation facilities, 
still prevents the utilization of many deposits of clay, gypsum, 
stone, iron ore, cement rock and glass sand, and makes im- 
possible the profitable operation of cotton mills. 
The University of Texas, among other things, is alive to the 
fact that the problem of fuel supply is primarily the problem 
of Texas. If it solves or aids in the solution—as it is now 
doing—it will contribute much to the material welfare of 
this State. If it should accomplish nothing else other than 
the solution of this problem, its existence and establishment 
will have been justified, and it will have repaid to the people 
with interest compounded all of the money that it has taken 
from them. 
This, then, is one of the problems upon which we are actively 
at work—though we know that perforce in solving it, we will 
generate other problems almost as profound. We have dis- 
covered that though we do not possess the anthracite of Penn- 
sylvania, we do possess something almost equally as valuable. 
What is lacking in quality is made up in quantity. It is very 
probably true that our lignite deposits will prove the ultimate 
solution of the problem I have outlined. It is along this line

that our efforts are now being largely concentrated. We are 
at work determining the extent, occurrence and character of 
these deposits; we have been making investigations into the 
proper and most suitable methods of firing this fuel under 
stationary boilers; we hope to materially enlarge these in- 
vestigations so as to determine the relative efficiency of lig- 
nite when used in gas producers; we are agitating for the 
more extensive use of this fuel by the domestic consumers; and 
we are advertising the existence and the possibilities of these 
stores to the outside world. 
This work was first begun by Mr. E. T. Dumble as State 
Geologist, now chief geologist for the Southern Pacific Rail- 
road and a distinguished citizen of Houston. The University 
has largely assumed and succeeded to the activities of the 
former State geological survey, and since the unfortunate dis- 
continuance of that survey it has attempted, as far as pos- 
sible to continue the efforts so successfully inaugurated by Mr. 
Dumble. 
The efforts made in these directions have already brought 
profound results. It is the source of much gratification to 
those who are able to appreciate its significance to know that 
our lignite is being more extensively used each day, and that 
new deposits are constantly coming one the market. We are 
mining now nearly nine times as much lignite as we were in 
1895, when the extent and the value of these deposits were 
first made known through the medium of a report issued by 
Mr. Dumble which still remains the most comprehensive on 
the subject, and which perhaps has had more to do with such 
development as has occurred than any other single influence. 
It is the hope of the University that it will become—through 
its present activities, and the activities contemplated—one of 
the most important influences in the acceleration of this 
development. We hope to see the time, when, as a result 
largely of these activities, a railroad will span every county, 
an electric interurban will connect every village, and when a 
cotton mill will adorn every county seat. We hope and be- 
lieve that then a happy and contented people—an educated 
and a militant people—will grace the homes of this fair land.

WISE, HONEST AND JUST ADMINISTRATION OF COL- 
LEGE ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. 
DR. JAMES ELLIOTT WALMSLEY, JACKSON, MISS. 
The title of this paper suggests its own grouping into the 
three classic divisions, but before deciding what is wise, or 
honest, or just we would settle one thing as a premise. Why 
should there be entrance requirements? Why should not any 
one willing to take the risk be admitted to any class to get 
what benefit he can from the course and to take his own 
chances of passing on what examinations may be set? Some- 
thing like this was the rule for years at the University of Vir- 
ginia, and the results were not all bad. This is another phase 
of a question which should be asked oftener than is the rule, 
“What is a college?” I know of no better definition than the 
one set forth by Dr. Henry S. Pritchett: “That ideal con- 
templates a group of able, cultured and devoted teachers liv- 
ing and working in social and intellectual communion with 
an alert body of youth so nearly homogeneous in age and in- 
tellectual equipment that the members of this body react the 
one upon the other.” 
Accepting this definition we see clearly that to admit im- 
mature students is to break up the homogeneity and to lower 
the quality of the work, while the opposite extreme of admit- 
ting students of too great maturity will equally destroy the 
poise. Every successful teacher soon catches the one and spirit 
of his class, and his work is then an adaptation of himself to 
that class, so that no two years’ work in the same course will 
be exactly the same in spirit and emphasis. Last year in 
attempting to train an assistant I put a student doing grad- 
uate work into a new freshman course that I was giving. I 
soon found that I was teaching that student and missing 76 
others. This year, owing to exigencies of a schedule I have 
three or four freshmen in junior classes, and I am having dif- 
ficulties in getting my mental balance. If this is true in one 
department, it is much more true in the college at large with 
its various departments, and its varied social and literary 
activities, often of much more importance than the work of 
the class room. Instead of being a kindness it is really a
-P-A-G-E-416
  416 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
cruelty to admit an immature student to an institution where 
there can be no real harmony of ideals. 
It is unfortunate that this vital subject has been for years 
in educational gatherings a dark and bloody ground. The 
sessions of the National Education Association have been 
marred by angry tones and skillful sarcasm, but enlightened 
by a little calm thought on the subject. The meeting of the 
Department of Superintendence at Mobile last winter showed 
more real sanity than any meeting for several years, and it 
was at this meeting that the President of Miami University 
said: “The earnest prayer of every progressive teacher of our 
own times should be for poise, for balance, and for real san- 
ity.” And it is the executive officer in charge of administering 
entrance requirements that is particularly in need of this rare 
grace of saving common sense. 
Out of the chaos of rallying cries is emerging one idea of 
self-evident weight, that education must be a unity; that 
in the words of Dr. Pritchett, “The same methods that make 
for efficiency in the training of boys and girls for college will 
also make for efficiency in the training of boys and girls for 
their vocation.” If our college and our high school are both 
honestly meeting the purpose of their existence they must 
have the same object in view—that of preparing living men 
and women for the strenuous life of modern civilization. I 
have little patience with that conceited form of ignorance that 
pictures the college man with no work to do, leading a life 
half aristocrat and half hobo, and not facing exactly the same 
problems which his less fortunate brother without college 
training must meet. I am tired of the empty assumption that 
colleges are for the purpose of training men for the polite 
professions. 
The real weakness of colleges is repeated in the high schools, 
a little smattering of this and a few months of that, a repeti- 
tion of that cheap pedagogical fallacy that education is like 
eating dinner, “Not every man likes the same thing, and you 
must provide for different tastes.” And the intellectual in- 
digestion that is cramping our educational progress is largely 
due to indiscriminate feeding on the part of spoiled children. 
While not agreeing in every detail with the report on Articu- 
lation of High School and College adopted this past sum-
-P-A-G-E-417
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 417 
mer at the San Francisco meeting of the National Education 
Association, I am especially delighted with the insistence on 
continuity of work in standard subjects implied in the recom- 
mendation that every high school course include at least two 
majors of three units each and one minor of two units. 
On only one point are our colleges agreed, the demand of 
fourteen or fifteen units for entrance, always including three 
units in English. Beyond this we have almost no uniformity, 
and we have the spectacle of two students from the same high 
school entering fourteen unit colleges in the same States, one 
with full credits, the other with two conditions. While abso- 
lute uniformity in entrance requirements is perhaps not de- 
sirable, a greater degree of uniformity in all our Southern 
States in desirable and certainly in each State the organiza- 
tion of State association of colleges can do much to help in 
this line. The differences are minor in character, though they 
seem matters of principle to each college but they tend to 
harass the preparatory school in a manner wholly unjustifi- 
able. We need far more insistence on a few fundamental facts 
of education and a broader view of educational problems in 
place of our undue stressing of minor differences. It is hoped 
that the tabulated statement, prepared as an exhibit with this 
paper, may be of help in suggesting ideas of agreement. 
After these prefatory words let us take up the subject as 
assigned: “Wise, Honest and Just Administration of College 
Entrance Requirements.” I shall interpret these terms as 
follows: Wise, from the point of view of the interest of the 
college; honest, from the point of view of carrying out strictly 
the published requirements; just, from the point of view of 
the interest of the individual student. 
First, as to what is wise, we may regard the obligation 
of the entrance authorities to the college itself, to the con- 
stituency, and to the ideal of scholarship. The modern college 
is founded for a definite purpose, to give a certain broad 
basis of culture that will develop the man rather than the 
machine; and no matter how able a faculty may be, it is im- 
possible to do this work without adequate preparation on the 
part of the student. Every college is under a moral obliga- 
tion to its constituency—whether the State, a religious denom- 
ination, or private donors—and it cannot discharge this obliga- 
27
-P-A-G-E-418
  418 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
tion of honest college work if it fills its halls with immature 
boys. While the ideal of scholarship is supposed to be the 
special aim of the university, yet the foundation of real scholar. 
ship is laid in the college and that foundation cannot be even 
imagined unless there is that homogeneity of spirit and aim 
which Dr. Pritchett makes his criterion of the true college. 
From all these points of view it is exceedingly hazardous 
to admit under any pretense immature and unprepared 
students. Theoretically one of two things must happen, the 
teacher must teach in a language and on a plane unknown to 
these misfits, or he must lighten the course to fit their attain- 
ments. Unfortunately for the college it is the latter that 
usually happens and the standing of the whole college and the 
thorough training due to those students who have fitted them- 
selves for what the entrance requirements seem to mean, are 
sacrificed to the weak sentiment of giving the boy a chance 
to show what he can do. Really we are stultifying ourselves 
by outlining a college course that contains enough bone and 
muscle for the boy who has prepared himself by four success- 
ful years of high school work, and then tacitly admitting that 
another boy who is unprepared to start with can complete 
this course and at the same time do two or four single year’s 
work in getting rid of conditions. 
As a parting thought, under this head of wisdom of require- 
ments, I might say that a modicum of good hard common sense 
is an excellent thing to use along with all theories. I believe 
in specifying entrance requirements but in specification in 
amount rather than in detail. When an institution demanding 
six orations of Cicero conditions a student offering seven be- 
cause a certain oration is not offered it at least raises the 
question of the presence of a Dr. Dryasdust in the faculty. 
When two institutions drawing patronage from the same com- 
munity demand for one year’s German credit selections from 
four authors, but specify different authors, it is manifestly un- 
fair to the secondary school. 
When it comes to the subject of honesty in enforcing stand- 
ards, we reach a moral rather than an intellectual subject and 
I fear that college men rank no higher in technical morality 
than men in any other business. The chancelor of a Southern 
university recently said to me, “We don’t need any more honest
-P-A-G-E-419
Te ee 
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 419 
requirements, we need some honest men to enforce what we 
have.” 
We have heard for years that the present conditions in the 
South do not permit high or thorough standards. At the risk 
of being classed as a hopeless insurgent, let me say that I 
don’t believe a word of it. That time has passed. With the 
remarkable development of Southern high schools in the last 
five years, with the existence of private secondary schools 
accessible to those rural pupils not yet reached by the high 
school, we have fully reached the time when we can demand 
fourteen or fifteen units for entrance, can honestly enforce 
the demand, and can put the high school students at present 
enrolled in college back where they can receive the training 
best suited for them. My own opinion is that no Southern 
college need allow conditions in any subjects except Greek 
and modern languages. 
The principal cause for this lack of honesty in enforcing 
entrance requirements is the desire for a large enrollment. 
The American mania for measuring prosperity in figures and 
success in numbers has invaded our colleges, and you will find 
conservative college men after discussing standards of work 
inquire rather enviously, “What is your enrollment this year?” 
This mania for numbers is more prevalent in the State institu- 
tions than in private colleges, for a rather interesting reason. 
The denominational or private college knows that its income 
from year to year is practically a fixed quantity, while the 
executives of State institutions must, every few years, labor 
with a legislature for their annual appropriation. No argu- 
ment has yet been found that will appeal to the average legis- 
lator except that attendance has increased and a greater ap- 
propriation is needed. Consequently we find in many State 
institutions a constant struggle between the faculty and the 
financial authorities of the institution-—the faculty endeavor- 
ing to hold up the standard of admission, the financial au- 
thorities endeavoring to increase the enrollment in order to 
secure needed funds. 
A second clause which has played havoc with the honesty 
of the entrance committee is the requirement of the Southern 
Intercollegiate Athletic Association, that no first year student 
may play intercollegiate ball unless he has matriculated with  
-P-A-G-E-420

fourteen Carnegie entrance units. In one case under my own 
knowledge of two students graduating in the same class from 
a high school, one without athletic ability, after making up 
one-half unit, entered one college with twelve units, the other 
with marked athletic ability entered a neighboring college 
with fourteen full credits. I will mention only one other in- 
stance of the many that I have observed. An athletic young 
boy left the high school in the second week of his eighth grade, 
went to a private preparatory school and two years later was 
on a university football team with his fourteen units credit. 
In fact, it is more than common rumor that at least one 
preparatory school in the Southern States exists largely for 
the sake of supplying entrance credits to ambitious athletes. 
In several of our Southern States professional schools exist 
as mere side entrances for students who could not otherwise 
enter college or university. I have known of several students 
who have entered colleges by this means thus rendering them- 
selves eligible for athletics or fraternities when they had been 
refused entrance through the acadmeic channels. I have pre- 
pared no figures for the professional schools of the Southern 
States. In Mississippi there are two law schools, one of which 
frankly advertises no entrance requirements for the law de. 
partment and honestly lives up to its advertisement; the other 
has advertised for years the same entrance requirements for 
the law department as for the academic, but has never claimed 
until this year to enforce in any sense these requirements. 
One more illustration of these grosser forms of dishonesty 
and I will hasten to leave this painful subject. I was con- 
nected for several years with an institution in which the pro- 
fessor of Greek advertised entrance requirements of one year’s 
work in beginning Greek, a freshman class in Anabasis, sopho- 
more class in Lysias, etc., as a matter of fact for six years to 
my certain knowledge and probably for twenty years he taught 
his freshman class beginning Greek and credited it for fresh- 
man work, read Anabasis with his sophomores, and Lysias 
with his juniors. To any question in regard to this method 
of handling work he answered that it would not look well for 
the good name of the college to advertise no entrance require- 
ments in Greek. 
Under the head of justice to the individual student, we must
-P-A-G-E-421
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 421 
consider the question whether circumstances ever arise under 
which it would be unjust not to admit certain students who do 
not come up to the entrance requirements. It would seem 
that the fundamental question here is the student’s relation 
to the high school. A boy under twenty-one who is unprepared 
for college, belongs in the high school; and not only for the 
sake of the integrity of the high school, but for the real train- 
ing of the boy he should be kept there. On the other hand, 
there may be mature and serious persons who, for one reason 
or another, have not pursued the regular educational routine, 
and who through extraordinary effort have won a second 
chance; their seriousness of purpose and their maturity of 
development amply compensate a technical deficiency in en- 
trance units. It would be manifestly unjust to exclude from 
academic privileges a student who, relatively late in life, thus 
gains access to collegiate opportunities. This comparatively 
small number of students may well be admitted and classed 
as special students, but it is both dishonest and untrue to the 
best interest of the student to extend this class by including 
immature boys who cannot meet requirements, but who do 
not want to spend another year in the secondary schools. 
It is hard to conceive a greater injustice to a student than 
to admit him weakened by inadequate preparation to what 
must be unfair competition with other men who are fully pre- 
pared for carrying regular work. This usually results in such 
discouragement that the student soon falls out of the course. 
It is my experience that the great majority of those students 
who drop out before reaching the end of the sophomore year 
come from this heavily conditioned class. If such a student 
persists in his course he continues under such serious disad- 
vantages that his college work is a heavy drag to himself and 
to his teachers. Dr. Pritchett well says, in the Fourth Report 
of the Carnegie Foundation: “In no other institutions of 
higher learning as in our American colleges is so large an 
amount of teaching energy given to lifting the unready over 
difficulties and to dragging mediocrity to graduation.” 
In illustration of some of the points advanced in this paper 
I here submit a tabulated statement of the entrance requirements 
of Southern colleges for the A.B. degree. I have endeavored to 
secure information from all the colleges in the limits of the

{No method indicated by which the remaining half unit may be attained. 
*Units in Mathematics are not standard units. 
I have prepared no detailed table of the number of condi- 
tioned students in each college, but, from consulting a similar 
table prepared by President Gaines of Agnes Scott College 
for the Association of Southern Colleges and Preparatory 
Schools, I feel it safe to say that more than one-half of the 
freshman students are conditioned with from one to four con- 
ditions. Of course four conditions mean one year’s work, and 
this means that the student is counted on the college rolls 
while actually belonging to the secondary school. With a 
smaller number of conditions conditioned students may mean 
one of two things: either an attempt to swell the enrollment 
by the presence of immature boys, or a rigidly specified list of 
entrance requirements. In the latter case a student may have 
 
-P-A-G-E-424
  424 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
done fourteen or fifteen units of work, but may yet fail to meet 
the exact requirments. This student may be well fitted for 
college work, while a conditioned student in a college offering 
a wide range of electives is likely to be sadly deficient. 
In the matter of specified units the table, although compiled 
from the entrance requirements, is not always accurate, inas- 
much as there are conflicting clauses in the catalogue. For 
instance, Millsaps College, with whose requirements I am most 
familiar, specifies nine and one-half units with four and one- 
half elective, but adds the following paragraph: “The above 
is for entrance to the college, but for entrance to any depart- 
ment the student must satisfy the minimum entrance require- 
ment of that department.” As a matter of fact, this makes 
the specified requirement for the B.A. degree twelve and one- 
half units, with one and one-half units elective. 
The last column in the table headed “Other Subects” in- 
cludes those which are accepted as entrance units by some in- 
stitutions, but in which no college courses are offered. On any 
topic concerning what is called “vocational subjects” I speak 
with due caution, having been often beaten with rods by the 
zealous advocates of the theory that one subject is as good as 
another. Yet it would seem to an unprejudiced observer that 
of two colleges each of which offers the same general number of 
departments of college work, the one requiring fourteen units 
of work of the kind which the college proposes to do, should 
be ranked higher than the one requiring eight units of such 
work and allowing six units of other work. 
The College Entrance Examination Board (Carnegie Founda- 
tion) allows fourteen different subjects, aggregating thirty-one 
units, to be accepted for entrance into colleges of first-class 
standing. Comparing this list with the actual subjects ac- 
cepted, it appears that several of our universities and colleges 
are accepting a large number of subjects not found in the offi- 
cial list of Carnegie units. The following are a few of these 
subjects: physiology, civics, shop-work, agriculture, commercial 
geography, astronomy, manual training, surveying, domestic 
science, State history, geology, economics, bookkeeping, wood- 
working, foundry work, forge work, stenography and type- 
writing. From this it appears that it is possible for students 
to enter some of our universities or colleges with less than 
the advertised number of Carnegie units.

With this brief analysis of conditions at they are, I recur 
to the principal thesis of this paper, that while our colleges of 
the South are fitted in faculties and often in plants to do thor- 
ough work; while they are, as a rule, inspired by the real spirit 
of scholarship, yet today they are facing the danger of a 
subtle lowering of standards under the pressure of the demand 
for numbers taking the form of a more or less open relaxation of 
entrance requirements. 
THE PROPER RELATION OF THE AMERICAN HIGH 
SCHOOL TO THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY. 
HON, ARTHUR LEFEVRE, AUSTIN, TEXAS. 
The main desideratum for a useful consideration of any prac- 
tical question is a distinct separation of the essential principles 
that must underlie any wise conclusion from those subordinate 
details which are, in their nature, either of transitory import or 
of dubious effect. The most injurious mistakes made by man; 
kind proceed from the common failure to attain such clarity of 
reasoning in the popular consideration of plans for ‘societal 
action. This fact is not merely the consequence of the infinite 
complexity of every concrete problem of social welfare, but it is 
also the result of an interference by the passions, which are 
always involved, and generally illogically involved, in every 
matter requiring sustained coéperation. 
For instance, whatever the proper societal relations of men 
and women may be, there should be no war of sex against sex, 
and by imagining that there is or ought to be such antagonism, 
some women are bringing hardships upon us all. 
Whatever the proper relation of the American high school to 
the American university may be, it is certain that the men who 
are clamoring about antagonistic purposes or interests are 
darkening counsel. It is undoubtedly true that some damage, 
along with mutual services, has come from each side to the 
other, but there is no conflict of genuine interests. 
I believe I shall best employ the brief time allotted, if I do 
not consume any of it in formulated statement of the proper 
relation of our high schools and our universities, but allow that 
to be inferred from indicated errors of activity and of attitude. 
The most conspicuous mistake that has been made by the 
‘higher institutions is but one of innumerable manifestations of 
 
-P-A-G-E-426
  426 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
an idea by which the American people have been beset for the 
last decade—an obscession that has led to intemperate legisla- 
tion in many different spheres. No one is so active as a zealous 
innovator, none so prone to enforce by law-making power 
(whether that power be legitimate or usurped) any notion of 
virtue or expediency that may take possession of an undisci- 
plined mind. Such men have of late years exercised an abnormal 
influence in the off-hand faculty debates wherein such matters 
are wont to be determined by our universities. Thus, partly 
from inadvertence, partly from the tendency to attempt to get 
by force of law results unattainable by such means (which has 
spread like an insidious disease even to some minds of the better 
sort}, many universities have imposed ill-considered regulations 
upon secondary schools. 
A point to bear in mind, however, is that we have herein not 
at all something done at the expense of the high schools for the 
good of the universities, as some are exclaiming; but that, on 
the contrary, all true interests of the universities suffer more 
from these mistakes than do the high schools. While the high 
schools may well lift aloud the voice of protest against some 
injurious restrictions forcibly imposed upon them, they are in a 
position to make the retort: “Daughters of Jerusalem, weep 
not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.” 
The important characteristics of the abuse of power we are 
considering are the absence of evil intention, its accidental 
nature, and the ease with which it could be corrected. It is 
only necessary for the universities to recognize that they ought 
not to dictate beyond minimum requirements for profitable 
attendance in the first courses of study offered by them. They 
may and ought to give advice far beyond their peremptory 
requirements; but it is neither possible nor desirable for them 
to inspect authoritatively everything that an affiliated high 
school undertakes to do. 
Within the sphere of legitimate demands for admission to 
college, it would be well to establish more thoroughly the author- 
ity of the university, but the attempt to spread authority over 
everything and for all purposes weakens it where it is legitimate 
and would be beneficial. 
The universities should thank their stars that the burden and 
responsibility of legislating for the general good of the high
-P-A-G-E-427
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 427 
schools (as distinguished from the legitimate requirements I 
have mentioned) does not rest upon them. On the other hand, 
I would have the universities become far more sensible of their 
true responsibility for wise counsel, in this and in inany other 
spheres. 
A good basis for the development of the proper relation be- 
tween secondary schools and colleges would be provided by two 
easy reforms, to wit: the repeal of supererogatory regulations, 
and recognition of the fact that advice is better not given unless 
it be wise advice. 
If these remarks were left entirely without concrete illustra- 
tion, it is probable that their true bearings might not be under- 
stood by some. For that reason I cite two examples: 
One of the largest universities in the United States (not a 
State University) has undertaken the direct government (except 
for “independent business management,” which is solemnly per- 
mitted) of “all academies and other secondary schools” that 
aspire to be “affiliated.” Only those schools are admitted to 
that high adoption which place themselves “under the advisory 
management of the University in respect to faculties, curricula, 
and educational methods.” The usual relation of “inspecting” | 
everything and “recognizing” or not recognizing, is also main- 
tained with other schools, which is designated by the term 
“codperation ;” but this term, all are advised, is to be “carefully 
distinguished from ‘affiliation.’” To such an extreme, in its 
zeal to be “doing things,” has one department of the “science 
and art of education” precipitated its university. 
Another institution (a State University) promulgated last 
year the requirement that for full credit in the subject of 
English, “at least one-fourth of all the pupil’s school work, in 
each year of a four years’ high school course, must be done in 
English.” Some other colleges may have made the same law, 
but as far as I know, this particular fatuity is unique. It has, | 
also, been quietly revoked after protest from high school men; 
nevertheless it aptly illustrates the sort of thing that the mis- 
taken attitude I am indicating is likely to cause a university to 
stumble into. 
The entire limits of this address would not be sufficient to 
point out all the objections, fundamental and incidental, to this 
demand. Of course, the full credit in English which was con- 
Sg
-P-A-G-E-428
  428 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
ditioned on this peculiar ground was not required for admission, 
but the exaction was set up as a criterion for superlative 
approval. 
It might be well, indeed, to offer different degrees of approba- 
tion or “credit” in the subjects chosen for authoritative inspec- 
tion; but excellence of results is the only rational ground for 
the highest credit. To make the devotion of some absolute 
amount of time a requisite, might not be absurd; but to demand 
an absolute ratio to the time devoted to all other activities, is 
not only preposterous in the abstract, but would interfere with 
many desirable possibilities. For instance, a pupil who, in even 
one of his four years, had taken five studies would, under this 
peculiar rule, forfeit a degree of credit in English to which, by 
hypothesis, he would have been entitled by the amount and 
quality of his knowledge of English, had he not taken that fifth 
study. 
Two years ago I would not have believed that such a rule 
could be enacted by a respectable faculty, except through inat- 
tention to a thoughtless proposal by some individual who had 
been entrusted with matters too wonderful for him. But I 
learned through experience that clear statements of objections 
were not only unconvincing, but apparently unintelligible to 
some men who are presumed experts. I may, therefore, without 
apology, point out several more self-evident facts: (1) It is 
impossible to estimate the amount of time a pupil devotes to any 
one study by the number of “recitations.” (2) English is 
learned best in the school where the precepts of the English 
class-room are practically enforced in every other room, and 
through proper study of some other language. (3) If the 
university’s influence were strong enough to excite ambition to 
win its maximum approval in the subject of English, some 
almost indispensable studies would be crowded out of reach. 
This would necessarily follow in the particular case referred to, 
because of the simultaneous regulation compelling every subject 
to be taught every day. That is to say, five recitations a week 
throughout the year must be devoted to a subject, or credit for 
a year’s study of it is refused. The whole obliquity of the pro- 
posed rule for full credit in English is not apparent until the 
other rule requiring five periods a week in every subject is taken 
into account. 
 
-P-A-G-E-429
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 429 
The colleges of this country might be classified as to their 
relations with secondary schools, into those that define a “unit” 
of credit for admission as (1) not less than three recitations a 
week for a year; (2) not less than four a week, and (3) those 
who do not allow any elbow room at all, but require recitations 
every day in every subject, on pain of exacting two years’ work 
for one year’s credit. This order of 1, 2 and 3 would correspond 
to a decreasing comprehension of the subject-matter of the 
legislation. Of course, I do not mean to suggest the preferabil- 
ity of the minimum for any subject, and certainly not for all; 
but latitude is needed for the very reason that different allot- 
ments ought to be made for different subjects, or for the same 
subject under different conditions. 
There are two ways whereby proper relations of our high 
schools to our universities might be established so as to safe- 
guard legitimate requirements for entrance, and so as to set and 
keep the high schools free to fulfill their manifold functions: 
One way is for the universities to admit through their own 
examinations, offering the same examination at every high 
school requesting it, and at their own doors—as many univer- 
sities as possible adopting the same examination. This is the 
simplest way of avoiding the existing evils. It would be fol. 
lowed unless the preferable but more difficult way is cleared of 
present obstructions. It has proved satisfactory in England, 
where it has grown steadily in the esteem of all concerned. 
The advantages of such a system competently administered 
may be considered by reading an able discussion of the question 
by President Edward McQueen Gray, of the University of New 
Mexico, issued last month as a bulletin of that university, enti- 
tled, “How the Curriculum of the Secondary Schools Might Be 
Reconstructed.” Aside from its direct bearings, I would recom- 
mend that paper to every teacher for its exposition of the nature 
of a good examination. Of one thing we may be sure: The 
disrepute into which all examinations have fallen among the 
American people is the result of the fact that most of the exam- 
inations within their experience have not had the characteristics 
of a good examination. As with everything else, the worth of 
an examination depends on its quality. 
The other way is for the universities to recede from their 
vain attempt to control, by requirements for “recognition,”  
-P-A-G-E-430
  430 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
everything that the high schools do. No such task is imposed 
upon them either by duty or necessity. On the contrary, the 
attempt dissipates their legitimate and much needed influence, 
and demoralizes the secondary schools. 
The universities may justly and prudently require for ad- 
mission to their courses of instruction a fair quota of the 
proper results of what we term “formal education,” sufficient 
discipline of mind to proceed firmly and swiftly in the new ad- 
vances contemplated in the college curriculum, and in several 
subjects a definite minimum of accurate knowledge which is 
presupposed by the corresponding college courses. This they 
could successfully exact, and it is far more than they now get. 
By attending to too many things, they are missing the things 
most essential to their own primary responsibility—upon 
which even the higher developments of their great enterprises 
rest. 
The system of inspection and affiliation, with all its alluring 
and noble possibilities, will survive only through genuine use- 
fulness. And it can become genuinely useful only if the uni- 
versities maintain a temperate and high-minded self-restraint. 
The university should offer counsel upon any subject when- 
ever it has ripened counsel to offer; but in the matter of re- 
quirements for admission it ought to restrain itself to a de- 
mand for good quality in the results of a few studies. And 
that demand must leave perfectly free a considerable margin 
of time for such application as the individual high school may 
deem best. 
For the marginal part of the pupil’s time, the university 
need feel no responsible concern. There ought to be no run- 
ning to the university for “recognition” of this or that voca- 
tional instruction, manual training, or exercises in physical 
culture. Let the high school do all this, let the university give 
all good advice about it that it can command; but separate 
such matters from university regulation. 
If the university were attending directly to its own affair of 
entrance requirements, it would make a rational choice of sub- 
jects in which examination is advisable, in order to insure 
profit from the instruction offered. Nothing else needs to be 
or ought to be considered. Therefore the same subjects would 
be enough to legislate about in codperation with affiliated
-P-A-G-E-431
    JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 431 
schools, in order to admit their graduates without examina- 
tion. 
It ought to have been known in advance; but experience has 
demonstrated that to attempt more is to secure less. 
I shall say little about the shortcomings or duties of the high 
schools because little that bears upon the special subject of this 
address needs to be said. That the results of our educational 
activities at every stage are a mixture of good and evil, is to 
say no more than that those activities are social undertakings. 
The achievement of an individual mind and character may in 
rare instances approximate perfection; but no social undertak- 
ing has ever attained any such result. That secondary schools 
may just now be guilty of extraordinary shortcomings is 
merely the consequence of the extraordinary difficulties and 
disturbances that have beset them during recent years. Such 
is the point of view of every sympathetic critic, and every critic 
ought to be sympathetic. On the other hand, high school teach- 
ers and administrators might well take for the text of a profit- 
able self-examination Coventry Patmore’s loving reproach to 
womankind : 
“Ah, wasteful woman! 7 
How has she cheapened paradise ; 
How spoiled the bread and spilled the wine, 
Which spent with due respective thrift 
Had made brutes men and men divine.” 
It may be assumed, then, that there is room for infinite im- 
provement in both ideas and execution; but improvement 
would naturally follow the establishment of the proper rela-. 
tion with the universities. 
All questions could then be considered upon their merits. 
There would be no more bungling attempts to stretch out this 
and lop off that in order to make the same “unit” of each. 
The very men who have proved themselves such poor legislators 
would often be good advisers. Certain it is that the teaching 
of some subjects under prevalent arrangements is as loose and 
long-drawn-out as if the main purpose were to consume time. 
Subjects of study and allotments of time, best for one school, 
do not suit another. Vital organisms and quasi organisms, 
such as social institutions, have but one known way of improve- 
ment—by spontaneous variations and selections of the fittest.
-P-A-G-E-432
  432 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Uniformity means deterioration, and is possible only under 
arbitrary control. 
The situation of the secondary schools at the present time 
is such that it seems to me to be of peculiar, I may say vital, 
importance that they be set free to adjust themselves to a 
changing order. If the bonds are not speedily loosed, they 
will be burst with reactionary violence. 
In the relation of seekers and givers of counsel, the high 
schools and universities could find safe courses of action; but 
there is an importance in the present circumstances that every 
law, or requirement, should be framed to allow the greatest 
latitude consistent with efficiency. 
Let any man argue for his opinion that it is a mistake to 
study more than four subjects in one year, but let him not dare 
to enforce that opinion by an arbitrary requirement. Perhaps 
it may be discovered that there is no way to meet modern needs 
and tendencies without sacrificing paramount interests of the 
individual and society, except by carrying five subjects a year. 
But whatever experience with free variations may prove to be 
best, we may be sure that it is a mistake to give the same’ time 
to every subject. A clear mind would deem it very extraordi- 
nary, if it should not prove to be better to give five periods a 
week to some subjects, four to another, three to another, and 
soon. It is almost unthinkable to a disciplined mind that the 
same time for all could be best. It is at least an obvious fact 
that in some schools classes do more and better work in three 
periods a week than is done in others in five; or more and 
better in one year than results elsewhere in two years. Let 
us get away from the idea that school work can be measured 
by the clock. ‘ 
But the important thing is for the universities to get it out 
of their head that it is incumbent upon them to legislate on 
such questions. Let them inspect and test results to their sat- 
isfaction, and more keenly than they do; but let them forego 
the dictation of programs. 
The fundamental principles to which I have appealed in 
these hurried remarks stand on so wide a basis of hurfian his- 
tory and are so open to the experience or observation of all 
men, that it is almost superfluous to cite concurrent judgments. 
But it may help some who do not think independently, to men-
-P-A-G-E-433
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 433 
tion that the Report of the Committee of Nine on the Articu- 
lation of High School and College, presented last July to the 
National Educational Association has, as the gist of it, protests 
and recommendations such as I have suggested. The report does 
not deal much with underlying principles, but its specific com- 
plaints and its most important demands are corollaries of 
what I have set forth. A few quotations will sufficiently show 
this: 
“As an illustration of the confusion in the requirements of different 
colleges, one requires one foreign language, counts work in a second, 
gives no credit for a third; another requires two foreign languages and 
one unit in a third, unless music or physics is presented as a substitute; 
and a third absolutely requires three foreign languages.” 
“The most serious objection to the present condition is the restrictive 
effect upon true high school development.” 
“By following the usual college prescription, the best preparation for 
college is not secured.” 
“A course that is good in one high school may not be suited to an- 
other. Uniformity in this subject is utterly disastrous.” 
“Quantity should be subordinated to quality.” 
Speaking of the minimum that high schools should themselves 
exact of a graduate, the committee is of the opinion that “the 
quantitative requirement should be fifteen units.” But the 
committee demands that the university must not require or 
supervise more than “eleven units” out of the high school’s fifteen 
for any one course of study. Also, the committee’s “unit” repre- 
sents the requirements of not less than four periods a week. 
“That the subjects from which the margin (i, e., beyond the eleven 
units subject to university requirements) may be made up should be 
left entirely unspecified, appears to be vital to the progressive devel- 
opment of secondary education.” 
“As long as formal recognition must be sought for each new sub- 
ject, so long will the high school be subservient and not fully progressive. 
It ought to be possible for any high school at any time to introduce a 
subject that either meets the peculiar needs of the community or that 
appears to be the most appropriate vehicle for teachers of pronounced 
individuality.” 
The gist of these demands of the National Education Asso- 
ciation is that the high schools should themselves require a 
minimum of fifteen units for graduation, and that the univer- 
28 
 
-P-A-G-E-434
  434 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
sities should exact results of good quality in eleven units of 
each graduate’s course of study, leaving all work in excess of 
eleven units entirely free for such application as the high 
school may deem best to require or permit. 
The “unit” demanded by the committee represents not less 
than four periods a week. 
Such a program is thoroughly harmonious with my sug- 
gestions in all its bearings upon the proper relation to univer- 
sities. And in regard to the self-imposed requirements of high 
schools, there is only the difference that I would not advise the 
exaction of a whole “unit” for everything that the high school 
offers. It would be best to leave the margin, beyond the uni- 
versity’s requirements, free for determination by each high 
school. Such, indeed, may have been the intention of the com- 
mittee; but their plan may be understood to mean that the 
free margin of four or more units should be filled by full 
“units.” One-fourth of the program should be left free for the 
independent judgment of each school. 
Allow me a few concluding words to indicate my own con- 
ception of the potential consequences of the establishment of 
the proper relation between American high schools and uni- 
versities: 
Let us accept our American plan of advancing to a higher 
institution after the stage fixed by graduation from standard 
high schools, and of uniting in one student body the undergrad- 
uate and postgraduate student of our typical university, as 
probably more suitable to our needs and spirit than the German 
plan. 
If our universities will give up all attempt to rule the sec- 
ondary schools beyond intrinsically necessary requirements for 
admission, and will faithfully accept the high calling of guide, 
counsellor, and friend, the affiliated secondary schools would 
respond loyally, and the unaffiliated would sincerely seek to 
qualify themselves to enjoy such helpful relations. And wise 
decisions concerning principles and expediences would generally 
be reached, if the universities will recognize the prime necessity 
of choosing able Visitors of Schools. 
Advice, as I have said, is better not given unless it be wise 
advice. To take upon oneself the office of a counsellor is no 
light responsibility. In some States, universities have ap-
-P-A-G-E-435
JOURNAL OF PROOEEDINGS. 435 
pointed to be the mouthpiece of their advice a Visitor apparently 
chosen for his popularity with school men of the political sort, 
or because he was a “good mixer.” That is done, if the truth 
should be spoken, simply because the authorities have not been 
sensible of the responsibility to give good counsel when advice 
is voluntarily offered, and they have wanted a “drummer” for 
the university. The itch for numbers is a disease that noble 
educational institutions need today to be especially upon their 
guard against. 
It is worse than an impertinence to offer an incompetent 
adviser. I believe a university ought to seek more conscien- 
tiously for excellent qualifications in its Visitor of Schools than 
in any other of its agents and representatives. Experience, 
sound scholarship, ripened judgment, and a detached open- 
minded attitude toward all intellectual questions, are the essen- 
tial qualifications. The “good mixer” is seldom a good adviser, 
simply because he is so frequently a flatterer; and a flatterer is 
an enemy—according to Tacitus, an enemy of the “worst kind” 
—“pessimum genus inimicorum laudantes.” 
In regard to State educational systems, I want to make one 
remark about Texas. It was perfectly clear to the early law- 
makers of Texas, remarkably enlightened as they were, that all 
parts of the State’s work of education, from the elementary 
schools to the State University, ought to codperate as organs of 
a vital system. And they knew that the worst affliction that 
could befall the entire system would be any paralysis or derange- 
ment at the top. Nothing could be more inconsistent with the 
best traditions of Texas than the spectacle we sometimes witness 
of men claiming to champion the “common schools” in opposi- 
tion to allleged conflicting interests of higher education. 
The truth is, that no part of any system of education can be 
healthfully independent of any other part. From the lowest 
“grade” to the arena of adult life, the exit from one stage should 
be the entrance to the next. No matter where an individual 
may leave the system’s tutelage, at every stadium there is need 
for an index pointing upward. 
It is no argument against the maintenance of high schools or 
of universities, that comparatively small numbers reach those 
stages. Besides the necessity of an incentive to something 
beyond, nothing could be more blind than to suppose that only

those who attend a school are benefited by that school. All 
higher education, or anything that leads thereto, is of incalcu- 
lable worth to society at large, in countless ways which will 
suggest themselves to anyone who will take the trouble to think 
on the subject. Water runs down hill; yet the earth were 
sterile if water did not ascend to the sky. But men are prone 
to praise only the descending rain and the powerful down- 
flowing streams. And in the flow of life, the majority of us 
seem able to see only the mechanical results as life spends itself 
in downward-streaming activities of work and enjoyment, and 
are blind to the effects of ascending thought and emotion. Yet 
from that ascent comes the whole force and meaning and worth 
of life.

THE FUNCTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL. 
J. RB. RUTLAND, ASSOCIATE PROFDSSOR OF ENGLISH, ALABAMA 
POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE. 
In the preparation of this paper I have not tried to draw fine 
distinctions between the work of the high school and that of the 
elementary school and the college. In a certain sense all 
schools are finishing schools, and here I have tried to give some 
idea of the goal toward which the high school—and, in a meas- 
ure, all schools—should start its pupils with devotion and 
capacity for intelligent activity. As teachers we should keep 
in mind the finished product, the work our pupils are to do, and 
the communities in which they are to labor. The impatience 
of teachers with the practical demands of business men and 
every-day life is a sign of fossilization. For what I have to say, 
I claim no originality, but present it with hearty approval. 
In the beginning, I wish to define the function of the high 
school as an obligation to fit boys and girls for the duties of 
life by helping them to discover and develop their natural capac- 
ities and interests. The high school is a part of a State system 
and has obligations to the elementary school and to the college. 
It is an institution of the State and the community, and owes 
specific duties to both. But these apparently diverging aims 
center in its duty to fit the adolescent boy or girl for his or her 
destiny. During the high school age, boys and girls are growing 
rapidly. Sex consciousness appears. Social life acquires a 
new interest. Imagination extends its bounds, taking in the 
universe for its operations. A yearning to know and experience 
all that the world offers urges the youth to conquest. The 
young mind and body realize that they have greater faculties 
than they have been aware of. .To inspire and restrain these 
yearnings, to establish worthy ambitions, to enthrone habits of 
self-direction and self-control, and to fit minds and bodies for 
the work of the world, is the obligation of the high school. Ob- 
viously this kind of education is not merely for the few that go 
to college or even simply the few that now go to the high school, 
but for all. All should become honest, intelligent citizens, and 
self-supporting, enterprising, mutually helpful, enlightened 
members of the communities in which they live. The high 
school should be the popular school, and its function is to give
-P-A-G-E-438
  488 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
every child in its vicinity that training which will most ade- 
quately fit him for the best life possible in his community. 
The first obligation of the high school which I shall mention 
is that of preparing the child to make a living. Every parent 
has a right to expect that the school course will prepare his 
children to support themselves. Industrial schools, technical 
high schools, colleges of technology, are more popular today 
than the old academic schools, because they meet the actual 
demands of life better for a larger number of people, and those 
schools whose curricula have been enriched by the addition of 
courses in cooking, housekeeping, farming, woodworking, and 
other vocational subjects, are not only more popular, but are 
more successful in keeping their pupils throughout the course 
than schools without these subjects. If we really believe in 
universal education, we must agree that the farmer, the 
mechanic, the seamstress, and the cook should be as well pre- 
pared for their work as the lawyer, the teacher, or the cultured 
man of leisure. If all must be educated, all should have the 
training they need in the struggle for existence. Furthermore, 
most boys and girls are more easily educated through the motor 
activities, and practical studies give these the impetus to carry 
them through the course. On the other hand, the business 
world is demanding business English, practical arithmetic, 
applied science, commercial and industrial skill. A great many 
parents feel that four years spent in a course that adds little to 
the earning power of their children is wasted; and they are 
partly right. Our schools ought to help their pupils to become 
self-supporting. 
To be self-supporting, a man juste a healthy body, the ability 
to think, and a store of vocational knowledge. One of the first 
considerations of any school is the care of the body. Health 
of body and soundness of mind go hand in hand. It is cer- 
tainly the duty of the school to see that the health of the child 
is in no way impaired at school. School buildings should be 
properly lighted and ventilated. Pupils should be required to 
assume right positions in walking, sitting, and at work so that 
their physical efficiency may not be diminished. They should 
be protected against contagious diseases, and their play should 
be supervised to prevent them from overtaxing delicate organs. 
Our best schools have medical supervisors whose duty it is to
-P-A-G-E-439
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 439 
discover and help remove physical ailments, for a large percent- 
age of the failures in school are due to curable ills, and many 
children leave school on account of poor health. The principles 
of body cleanliness, school, home and community sanitation, 
should be taught from the first grade; but in the high school, 
when boys and girls are emerging from parental authority into 
manhood and womanhood, guidance and instruction in the 
prudent care of the body is imperative. At no time is the pupil 
readier to receive it or more in need of it. Games, organized 
play, school athletics for all students, exercise at work and at 
play, should be as much a part of the curriculum as English or 
arithmetic. On nothing is success more dependent than on a 
strong, vigorous body. 
Doing the work that the world pays for requires the ability 
to use one’s wits. One of the most imperative duties of the 
school is to train its pupils to think. The high school period 
is especially important because it is then, if ever, that the pupil 
learns to compel himself to mental application. Too many of 
our recitations are superficial parroting of the subject-matter. 
To read, to glean thought from the written page, requires think- 
ing. Some of our pupils go out into the world with the idea 
that studying is memorizing. To disintegrate a paragraph, 
separating its main idea and details, to pass judgment on the 
aptness of an illustration or the value of a conclusion, to accept 
opinions tentatively weighing evidence for and against to real- 
ize a general statement concretely by calling up illustrations 
and instances, to read with a specific aim in view unerringly 
sifting out what is irrelevant, to put statements to the test of 
experience or practical use—this is, to study, to think. Read- 
ing properly taught should, with the help of grammar and 
rhetoric, lead pupils to think for themselves by seeing what and 
how others have thought. Arithmetic in its practical aspects 
requires clearness of interpretation and gives skill in finding 
solutions. But how hesitatingly our pupils guess the next 
step, depending on our nodding approval to know that they are 
right! The pupil must learn to turn himself from rule and 
teacher and know some things for himself. Geography, if 
studied for the purpose of understanding how man’s environ- 
ment has influenced his activities and what he has done and is 
doing with nature’s gifts, offers vital aims for the organization
-P-A-G-E-440
  440 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
of facts, and the exercise of the reasoning powers. Almost any 
subject, properly taught, can be used as a means of teaching chil- 
dren to think. 
But the teacher needs more than a means of instruction. 
The learner must consent or the best of teachers and the best of 
plans will fail. Unlike the school of experience, the high school 
cannot force a child to think. He must be led. If the influ- 
ences at home do not predispose him to study, the teacher’s 
example is the greatest of the forces at his command. The 
atmosphere of independent, original work in school, due to the 
presence of the teacher’s active mind and to the natural response 
of many of his pupils, is the best inducement to mental applica- 
tion. However, if the teacher can implant a deep-seated con- 
viction that good thinking gives genuine satisfaction and that 
the most desirable attainments in life depend on the power to 
think, he will have won half the fight. On the other hand, it 
is the duty of the teacher to subject the pupils to every plan 
his ingenuity can devise. If Latin and English are uncongenial, 
let him try woodwork and sewing; if these fail, try cooking or 
gardening. Pupils cannot easily be brought to concentrate 
upon subjects which they do not like. It is the duty of the 
school to provide a curriculum so varied that every study may 
be available to teach the children to concentrate and to think. 
Business efficiency demands ability to work. It is not enough 
for one’s body to be strong enough to endure physical labor, but 
one should acquire in the high school bodily skill and dexterity. 
The best training is that which combines mental alertness and 
physical adroitness. The trained eye of the locomotive engineer, 
of the mechanic, of the architect, is as indispensable as the 
trained hand and brain. The senses of smell and of taste de- 
serve careful attention, because they are our food inspectors 
and the purveyors of much wholesome pleasure. The ear should 
be trained to listen attentively and to enjoy music and poetry. 
Upon skill in the use of the senses, success in many kinds of busi- 
ness and many of life’s best pleasures depend. Lord Chesterfield 
advocated horseback riding and dancing as good training in 
the gracefulness and ease so necessary in the society of his day. 
Lathe work, drawing, hoeing in the school garden, and all other 
forms of manual training, help a boy to gain an even control 
over his physical and mental faculties. Mental cultivation should
-P-A-G-E-441
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 441 
be reinforced by physical skill. Furthermore, the union of phys- 
ical with mental labors in school contributes strongly to the 
formation of habits of industry, and no qualification for success 
is greater than this. 
The chances of success in making a living are greatly multi- 
plied if the high school graduate is equipped with definite voca- 
tional training. Dean Davenport, of the University of Illinois, 
says that the function of the high school is “to educate its nat- 
ural and local constituency for the duties of life.” That is, it 
should be “a true picture of the life outside in all its essential 
activities.” | Whether the community be chiefly engaged in 
manufacturing, commercial enterprises, or agriculture, boys and 
girls should find in school such vocational instruction as will fit 
them to enter the business of their choice. If they wish to study 
typewriting, poultry raising, truck farming, stock farming, cook- 
ing, sewing, the school should give them the opportunity. We 
must recognize that one needful activity, whether well-digging 
or selling groceries, is as important as another, and that the 
well-digger and the grocer are entitled to such schooling as will 
help them in their business, and, at the same time, preserve their 
equal right to education and the pursuit of happiness. Further- 
more, the school should present as large a variety of industrial 
courses as possible, so that children may not be hampered in the 
least in finding the activity which best suits their capacities. 
Dr. Curry said a few years ago that education should not raise 
“hewers of wood and drawers of water” above their work, but 
should enable them to draw more water and hew more wood, 
and thus become more prosperous and happier citizens. 
The second obligation of the high school is to give to its pupils 
an impetus toward culture. By this I do not mean to say that 
such training as I have outlined for self-support lacks all the 
elements of culture. The passion for knowledge and the ability 
to think and to work, so indispensable in making a living, are 
also eminently characteristic of the man of true culture. The 
modern view of culture includes not only acquaintance with the 
classics, highly developed mental, imaginative, and moral 
powers, but also the obligations jof service, infusion of the 
scientific spirit of inquiry, acquaintance with the field of scien- 
tific knowledge, and even skill in some form of manual labor. It 
is scholarship at work in society, the positive force of the

efficient man more than the finish of phrase, delicacy of manner, 
classical attainments, depth of emotion, and scope of imagina- 
tion, that characterizes the cultured man of today. But these 
qualifications are not attained in a day, nor in a school course; 
it is the ideal of attainment of a lifetime. All that we can 
hope to do in the high school is to implant the desire for more 
learning and greater conquest in the field of personal endeavor. 
Just as vocational courses in school only introduce the pupil 
to his real life work, the ins and outs of which he must learn by 
experience, so the school only begins the cultivation of a lifetime. 
The individual must work out his own salvation. The school 
can help him by giving him a sense of values: the value of 
money, of work, of honesty, of politeness, of books, of man, of 
the highest aims of being. It must help him further by teach- 
ing him self-cultivation and dependence on his own initiative. 
If we give a boy a sufficiently strong ambition to know and to 
be, a sense of the true values of things, and the habit of energetic 
initiative, we give him all the forces he needs to attain his 
highest possibilities. 
We should see that our pupils attain some degree of correct- 
ness and precision in spoken and ‘written English. He who 
knows but cannot communicate his knowledge is not a culti- 
vated man. He who has something to say and can use ‘his 
mother tongue with ease, elegance, and individuality is welcome 
in any company. No man can be a peer of the best in any pro- 
fession or society without this power. Almost inseparable from 
this power of expression is literary appreciation. Too many of 
our teachers read only the newspapers and the text-books. No 
voice out of the past brings the gladness, or the wisdom, or the 
virtue, or the good fellowship afforded by the companionship of 
books. The habit of reading good books it is the duty of the 
school to foster in its pupils. From the earliest times literature 
has been the inspiration of the best men and women, because in 
it are portrayed human passion, human hopes, the desires, the 
wisdom, the aspirations, and achievements of the good and 
great in the past. Books will acquaint our pupils with the best 
in human nature and prepare them for the highest joys of 
human intercourse. The masters and great books provoke the 
best conversation in cultivated society. This course of study at 
the feet of the greatest teachers of men in all ages is one of the
-P-A-G-E-443
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 443 
best introductions a child can get to the highest life of the world. 
in preparing the way for literary appreciation, there must be a 
plentiful lack of formal analysis of masterpieces; and a good 
library full of books that appeal to the newly awakened thirst 
for travel, knowledge, and truth; and all the incentives at the 
command of a teacher who loves reading himself. 
Literary appreciation is closely allied to another qualification 
of culture, a love of the beautiful in nature and in art. The 
exercise of esthetic discernment has always characterized the 
man of culture. It is hardly possible to open the door to litera- 
ture without at the same time opening that to art. I do not 
mean art for art’s sake alone. In masterpieces of music, archi- 
tecture, sculpture, painting—just as in literature—we find the 
thoughts of mighty ‘minds about man and nature. All these 
arts record the hostory of man’s noblest achievements, greatest 
passions, and highest aspirations and ideals. I believe children 
should grow up surrounded by good pictures, loving good music 
and with a feeling of intimacy with external nature. A print 
of Raphael’s “Madonna” was once given to a first-grade girl to 
study as the basis of a language lesson. When she was asked 
what the picture told her, she replied: “The mother seems to 
love the little child dearly, and the little baby loves to be 
cuddled.” This, I believe, was a good beginning in the love of 
pictures. If when this child grew up she still kept an open 
heart to the inspiration of the picture and came to realize as a 
young woman the mother’s devotion to her God-child as here 
portrayed, there will have come into her life through this picture 
a conception of motherhood unsurpassed by religion. If love 
for this should lead her to love Raphael and his other pictures, 
and from him to Michael Angelo, Da Vinci, and others, she will 
have found an inexhaustible source of joy in life. To read 
“Paradise Lost,” some one has said, bespeaks a liberal education. 
To enjoy a music-drama of Wagner is also indicative of high 
culture. While only a few of us can attain to the highest 
appreciation in all the arts, all should at least be open to the 
appeal of such as are within our reach. Here again the school 
can only begin. I wish art and music might be taught in every 
high school. But we can contribute much to the esthetic enjoy- 
ment and training of our pupils by beautifying our school 
grounds and rooms. Smooth lawns, flower borders, school 
   
-P-A-G-E-444
  444 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
gardens on the outside; portraits of great men, casts of master- 
pieces of sculpture on the inside, will contribute greatly toward 
the desired effect. It is not hard to provide ocasional concerts 
by talented musicians, sometimes local talent and occasionally 
visiting companies. The discernment and enjoyment of beauty 
and excellence in man, nature, and art, is a source of much 
pleasure and of much inspiration in life. 
The third obligation of the high school is to prepare its pupils 
for citizenship—the girls as well as the boys—by teaching them 
how we are governed and by instilling patriotism. (Woman 
suffrage is not yet on our statute books, but it has been in vogue 
since the apple incident in Eden.) The stability of our govern- 
ment depends upon the intelligence, loyalty, and morality of its 
citizens; and the school should join forces with the family, the 
church, and the community in training young citizens to take 
part in their government. All should get at high school a fair 
idea of how the government is carried on. It is not enough to 
teach a text-book in civil government. In our history teaching, 
we should emphasize those great forces that secured our inde- 
pendence, those that gave us our constitution and form of goy- 
ernment, and those that have settled our policies from the 
earliest times. As far as possible, the children should be 
brought to understand the policies of today. Current events, 
elections, speeches by the great men of the day, opinions in 
papers and magazines, and congressional debates, should be used 
to interest them in how our people are governed and to arouse 
in them a strong conviction of patriotism. Loyalty to govern- 
ment is not easily taught by precept, but free and frank discus- 
sions of policies, of historical compromises, and of heroes should 
always leave in the hearts of young debaters the leaven of love 
for country. Such education it is the duty of the school as the 
creature of the State to give. Such education it owes to the 
pupil in order to help him preserve independence and equality, 
and to help him become a useful, intelligent citizen. 
Moral training is a vital consideration in preparing boys for 
citizenship. To be a cultured man today demands allegiance 
to right and to the service of others. It implies a clear discern- 
ment of the motives that impel us to action and a strength of 
will to follow the highest appeal. It behooves us, therefore, to 
ask what we are contributing to the child’s equipment for
-P-A-G-E-445

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 445 
righteous living. A prominent Alabamian said not long ago 
that the strongest incentive in our schools was promotion. This 
idea is so strong in many schools that for honest, consistent 
work is substituted superficial recitation, cramming for exam- 
ination, and often cheating. It is to be feared that to some 
teachers the most important thing is seeing that the children 
go through a course of study. The higher ideals of teaching 
pupils to think, of encouraging individuality in thought and 
work, of instilling a love for books and learning, of strengthen- 
ing habits of self-dependence, of clear insight into temptation, 
and a strong sense of obligation to right and to one’s fellows, 
are not as definite aims of instruction as they should be. We 
do not test for these results as consistently as we should. In 
our punishments, rewards, and our entire relationship with our 
pupils, are we sure that we act in such a way as not to encour- 
age them to act from motives which we would condemn in a 
public man? Are we teaching them to examine impulses and 
to act from virtuous motives? Every act, if wrong, should 
bring its condemnation from the doer’s mind. Every right 
action should be the direct expression of the doer’s feeling and 
thought. It is the school’s important duty to train its pupils 
in habits of acting from right motives. The spirit of honesty 
should so pervade the school atmosphere that lying and cheating 
would be well-nigh imposible. Children are not actually bad. 
They are open to all kinds of appeals, and they must find in 
school strong incentives to honesty and to the higher life. How- 
ever little we think of it, the school, the high school, is the train- 
ing ground of moral and civic character. Here we train the 
grafter, the vote-buyer, and the demagogue; or the man of prin- 
ciples, the conscientious voter, and the efficient servant of com- 
mon good. 
Self-reliance is a moral characteristic which is entirely too 
rare. Do our high school methods inculcate independence of 
thought? Our devices to get a pupil to study or to be regular 
in attendance are, to a large extent, valueless to the pupil unless 
they instill a sense of duty or an enthusiasm for work which will 
in actual life take the place of the school stimuli. To please 
the teacher and to win school honors are temporary stimuli; to 
do one’s duty, to attain the privileges of culture, to do efficient 
work in the world, to joy in the service of others, to fight the
-P-A-G-E-446
    446 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
harder to overcome obstacles, are permanent aims. To establish 
these is the duty of both the home and the school. Every lesson 
should bring forth some reaction and that should be true and 
individual for the pupil. ; 
Furthermore, the child ought to acquire in school such a con- 
ception of duty and such a control over himself that he may 
use his independence wisely. The boy who feels compelled to 
sow his wild oats has not had the best training in the use of 
liberty. He has been curbed in by parental authority, or 
repressed against his will into subjection at school. Seldom 
should the teacher’s authority be required to transcend the 
appeal of the boy’s higher nature. The forces that govern a 
school should, so far as possible, be those that govern society 
and the pupils as a body and individually should feel the con- 
straining influences of elevating them out of puny selfishness 
into good citizenship. Authority should come from conviction 
within rather than from the teacher. The reason for this is 
that the will is the basis of all character. If goodness is not 
supported by a strong determination to do right, it shows no 
moral character. The pupil with the weakest will is the 
hardest to teach, because he cannot compel himself to applica- 
tion. Outside authority deprives the will of its function; free- 
dom calls it into being. To learn to choose wisely, the child 
must have some freedom to choose. The right use of liberty 
comes only from practice. The child should acquire in school 
respect for law and a right conception of liberty. He should 
learn that his just opportunities and privileges are limited 
by the just opportunities and privileges of others; that law 
is the protection of a civilized community from the depreda- 
tions of the insolent and selfish; that true liberty is not license 
or selfishness unrestrained by decency and justice, but is the 
freedom which is mindful of the rights of others. He should 
learn also in school to confirm habitually in concrete cases 
this respect for the rights of others. In this matter of getting 
pupils to act from themselves we many get some suggestions 
from the George, Jr., Republic, where unmanageable boys 
make laws and execute justice. The confidence placed in boys 
convicted in his court by Judge Lindsey, who allows them to 
go alone two hundred and fifty miles to the farm where they 
serve their sentences, is worth a trial in the school room.
-P-A-G-E-447
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 447 
Self-control, will power, is the foundation of all character and 
it is our duty to help our pupils to dominate themselves so 
that when they become men they will use their liberty wisely. 
Finally, the high school should engender and vitalize in its 
pupils the spirit of service. Going into the world adequately 
equipped in mind and body to support themselves, inspired 
to grow in knowledge and culture, and fitted to become in- 
telligent, virtuous and independent citizens, they are ready 
for service. Too often, however, boys and girls leave school 
with the view of the world as a field of conquest. Money, 
position, honor are the goals toward which they strive, blind- 
ing themselves to the common duties of citizenship and social 
service. Their powers should be employed in developing the 
industrial and commercial resources of the community not 
simply for their private gain, but also for the prosperity and 
happiness of their neighbors. Their joy in books, their dis- 
cernment of the excellent in art and nature, their love of 
liberty for themselves and for others should strengthen the 
forces of community life that tend to general culture, intelli- 
gence, patriotism and usefulness. The school should be a 
democratic community where law is respected because obedi- 
ence is best for all. In doing their daily work, preparing for 
public exercises, carrying out plans for equiping the library, 
laboratory or other school accessories, the pupils should learn 
the benefits of working together to secure desired improve- 
ments. Here each pupil should learn to sacrifice his own ease 
to the good of his mates. Thoughtfulness of others as ex- 
pressed in good manners, and interest in others as expressed 
in social service, in doing something for others, the school 
must cultivate and foster. If the school is doing its full duty 
as the social center of the community, helping all within the 
range of its influence to do their work better and to live larger 
and nobler lives, the pupils will catch the spirit. Beside the 
hero in war, the statesman and the wealthy philanthropist in 
the child’s hall of fame, we must put the men and women who, 
like Sir Launfal, have shared their crust of service with their 
fellows. I like the spirit of a railroad agent in a little Ala- 
bama town who sends every year two boys to the University 
of Virginia, who has built and completely furnished a com- 
munity club house for the diversion and ‘educational and  
-P-A-G-E-448

moral improvement of his people, who writes and speaks for 
the nobler life and holds himself and his purse ready always 
to serve his fellow men and women. I like the patriotism of 
a well-known Southern editor who has refused high salaries 
to do newspaper work in the North because he preferred to 
help the Southern farmers work out the problems of his native 
section. I like the spirit of the government as expressed in 
its corps of farm demonstration agents and boys’ corn club 
organizations, and the spirit of some of our schools in their 
attempt to give the people just the education that they most 
need. The man or group of men in a community that provides 
good schools, good teachers, libraries, churches, and takes 
enough interest in them to see that they give the people the 
proper service are the salt of the earth. Somehow boys and 
girls should be brought to a realization of their obligation to 
give society the best that is in them. 
To do such services one needs a sense of his obligations to 
his community. He needs the motive power of enthusiasm 
for service. From the earliest years the youngster begins to 
picture to himself the life he wishes to live, the work he wishes 
to do. Though he may change his devotion from one ideal 
to another, if he has the right training he will never be with- 
out one. The teacher must see that the ideal of service is 
a vital part of this ambition. Work, however hard and dis- 
tasteful, is easy when the boy struggles toward some goal he 
devoutly wishes for. Laziness, indifference, and even bad 
habits he thrusts aside in the pursuit of his vision. It is 
affection, love, loyalty, enthusiasm that moves the world. Our 
schools should inspire youthful visions, encourage young 
Josephs to cling to their dreams and to fortify young Daniels 
to purpose in their hearts. The determined will does not work 
of itself, for it must be bolstered up by some ambition, some 
devotion. It is our duty as teachers to leaven these natural 
ambitions with the spirit of unselfishness; and, as far as pos- 
sible, make them visions of social helpfulness. 
It is not within the scope of this paper to determine how 
the high school may most truly fulfill its obligation to pre- 
pare children for self-support, culture, citizenship and ser- 
vice, but I wish to venture two suggestions. We must make 
our schools more efficient organs. It behooves us to examine 
 
-P-A-G-E-449
  
JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGS. 449 
our aims. Is the high school for all the people or for the 
few who go to college? Do we really believe in universal 
education—the education of the bricklayer, the clerk in the 
country store, the plowboy, the laundry woman, the cook? 
Why is it that today we graduate less than five percentum 
of our school children from the high school? I believe that 
our course of study should be revised so that we can give 
definite vocational training. The school in a cotton mill town, 
the school in a farming section, the school in a mining dis- 
trict, the school in a large city serve different communities 
and should render different services. Each should give the 
right kind of opportunity to every child within its influence. 
I am not criticising the present courses of study. They are 
good. They are best for some; but they are not best for all. 
The great number of our boys and girls must engage in com- 
mercial and industrial pursuits and should have practical 
training for them. A school course that does not fit for self- 
support is a failure. 
A second suggestion is that the high school teachers must 
recognize a larger obligation to the whole community. The 
education of the whole community should be their aim. Their 
duty does not end with membership in civic leagues, perfunc- 
tory church work, and the usual way of identifying one’s self 
with the community. The boys and girls who ought to be in 
school, but who must work, and others whom the day school 
cannot hold need night school, corn and tomato clubs, and 
reading courses to stimulate them to seek the full realization 
of their possibilities. Together with these the school can pro- 
vide farmers’ meetings where they can exchange ideas and 
experiences about soils, marketing and crops, and farmers’ 
institutes where experts from a distance may help the people 
solve their problems; women’s meetings for the purpose of dis- 
cussing home problems, cooking, sewing and of studying and 
reading for general culture; field days, with athletic events 
for all the elementary school pupils within reach and with 
a pleasant and instructive program for parents and teachers; 
district teachers’ associations to promote mutual helpfulness 
and to increase professional efficiency; county, State or school 
fair exhibits of all kinds. These and other plans of com- 
munity work will suggest themselves to progressive principals.

None can do all the things mentioned, but all should follow 
some definite plan for the improvement and enrichment of 
the life of their communities. The high school is the people’s 
college, and if they cannot come to school, the school must go 
out to them. 
THE FUNCTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL. 
J. P. WOMACK, MAGNOLIA, ARK. 
With the main features of the paper I am in hearty agree- 
ment, but there are some phases of the question to which I 
should like to call your attention further. 
In the first place, I see no reason for holding the high school 
responsible for all the results demanded. For example, pupils 
should be taught to think and work while in the grades. The 
youth who enters high school with no ability in this direction 
will find hard traveling. Vocational instruction should be be- 
gun in the grades, though of course only a beginning can be 
made. Literary appreciation is not only possible in the 
grades, but highly desirable. The child leaving the grammar 
school should know familiarly dozens of gems culled from the 
fields of literature. He may not know and appreciate literary 
values as the rhetorician knows and appreciates them, but he 
should have a feeling for them as he had for nursery tales 
and cradle lullabies when yet in baby clothes: The same is 
true with regard to his appreciation of the beautiful in art 
and nature, else why decorate the rooms of the primary and 
grammar grades with pictures and statuary, and why organize 
excursions to the woods and fields and rivers? Patriotism, 
too, should be inculcated in the minds and hearts of the chil- 
dren while still in the earliest years. To what other end do 
we observe so many birthdays and flag days, and sing so many 
patriotic songs? And finally, what better time can we find 
for moral instruction than in those early years when the moral 
nature is most susceptible to formative influences? 
I object to including all these activities in the function of 
the high school. As I understand the subject, to speak of the 
function of the high school as being essentially different from 
the function of any other unit of our educational system, is 
to take an unwarranted liberty with facts. The high school 
has a function peculiarly its own, in that it is entrusted with
-P-A-G-E-451
  
t JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 451 
a phase of the work not shared by the other units. A unit 
designed for work among adolescents must be different from 
one intended for children or adults. But in no other sense 
can we, I think, correctly speak of the high school as having 
peculiar functions. The college and the elementary school are 
in the same category. All logically conceived units in the 
educational system have one and the same function, and each 
unit merely “plays his part.” 
Education has been defined as a means of appreciating and 
controlling the values of life—of the things that to the one 
educated may seem worth while. The child of six, conscious 
of the lack of control of the power to combine numbers, sets 
himself to the task of learning to add. We speak of that 
activity as a process of elementary education. We see the 
same child ten years later wriggling over Caesar’s bridge or 
mixing bone meal and wood ashes in an effort to raise a ban- 
ner corn crop for the corn club exhibit; we call this high 
school education. The next view we have of the pupil under 
discussion is while he is wrestling with the metres of Horace 
or with parabolic curves; this we call college education. It 
may appear that we have sketched here three distinct phases 
of the boy’s mental development, and that each school in the 
series had a distinct function. But, after all, there were no 
differences in these processes save in the conditions under 
which they were performed. In each case the pupil, conscious 
of what at the time seemed worth while, was trying to gain 
control. At each phase of his development he became con- 
scious of new values in life and set about acquiring control 
of those values, and so the elementary school, the high school, 
and later the college or technical school phase found a place 
in his development. 
But in view of the fact that the high school has to do with 
adolescents, and the further and equally important fact that 
very few pupils go to the higher institutions of learning, it 
may not be out of place to indicate some functions that seem 
peculiar to the high school. 
In the first place the high school must take up and carry 
on the work begun in the grades but not completed. In this 
sense the high school is merely a continuation of the grammar 
school. Then, in its capacity as a vocational school, it should
-P-A-G-E-452
    452 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
give all possible training for after-school life. In the main 
this training must of necessity be general rather than specific 
in its nature, for it is manifestly impossible to give, even in 
our best equipped schools, all the pupils specific training for 
their future field of activity. But we can train the senses to 
a high degree of adaptability, and we can stimulate the mind 
by bringing as much as possible of the world within the range 
of the pupil’s vision, and thus give direction and motive to his 
life. 
I wish to lay increased emphasis on another prominent 
thought of the paper—the high school must help the youth 
find himself. He comes to the high school period without 
aim or purpose. He has been too young to know his own mind, 
and the range of his studies has been too narrow to give him 
needed suggestion and inspiration. The high school with its 
school garden, its laboratories, its reading, rooms, together 
with its liberal courses in literature, in the arts and sciences, 
shows him new values to be controlled and puts the means of 
controlling them into his hands. 
But for lack of time I can only enumerate the remaining 
functions that I would have you consider. The high school 
must perfect work begun in the grades, but not completed be- 
cause of the immaturity of the pupil at the time. It must 
look after all the boys and girls, and not merely the brightest 
and strongest, as the colleges have a way of doing. It must 
fit itself to local condtitions so as to be locally helpful. It 
must give to each the closest possible approximation to the 
training he needs to fit him for his life, present and future, 
whether he expects to plead law or make peanut butter. It 
must do in the main a finished work, for nearly all of its 
pupils will pass from its walls to active life without oppor- 
tunity for further training. It must fit for life rather than 
for college, and yet it must pave as broad a path as possible 
to the door of the college. It must provide for the deeper 
needs of the pupils, and help them to get correct bearings in 
life. It must assist pupils to adjust themselves to their en- 
vironments, or else to rise above these environments. In a 
word, it must do for the few children who remain in school 
from nine to twelve years all that has not been done for them 
in the home and the elementary school, and as much as pos-

sible of what the college or technical school would do for 
them if they could but go to the higher institutions. 
THE CURRICULUM OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS REOR- 
GANIZED TO INCLUDE SIX YEARS’ HIGH 
SCHOOL WORK. 
W. G. SMILBY, PRINCIPAL HIGH SCHOOL, HOUSTON, TEXAS. 
The period through which we are now passing has been 
characterized as the commercial age. Subordinated in func- 
tion to business interests are all other lines of human activity. 
Ideals of efficiency have been standardized by illustrations 
chosen from the world of business, with the result that today 
the government itself is a contestant for its rights as the 
agency of authority. 
Unfortunately our educational system is not on the list of 
exceptions to this universal dominance; less completely, per- 
haps, but none the less surely, have our secondary schools 
been marching and countermarching to music written in a 
key whose signature is.the dollar mark, as evidenced by a 
changing, ever-crowded curriculum in an attempt to respond 
to the public demand to afford specialization in our secondary 
schools. The time has come when experts in education must 
obtain control of the educational machinery and direct a re- 
organization of the high school curriculum. 
In the language of one who is neither a standpatter nor 
_ an anarchist, but a sane progressive school man of highest 
rank, I quote a few statements that will bring the situation 
clearly before us. 
“Tt is alleged that the weakest part of our educational sys- 
tem is the high school. It has less unity in theory and less 
definiteness in practice than any other, and those who have 
charge of its administration are less sure that they are doing 
the right thing than is the case with other types of schools. 
As a forcing house between the grammar school and the col- 
lege, the high school hasn’t time to do anything well. Hence 
it may be well to try to do fewer things, thus saving time 
to do some things better.” 
So much for the indictment to which we will assume that a 
plea of guilty is entered. We now proceed to show that the 
aforesaid conditions are due largely to the bungling inter-
-P-A-G-E-454
454 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
ference imposed by public demands which the department of 
secondary education lacked the background to resist. 
This lack of defensive attitude on the part of secondary 
schoolmen is the outgrowth of the application of logical rather 
than psychological principles in the construction and admin- 
istration of the high school curriculum. As a consequence, 
the results obtained are not such as to warrant a relationship 
of independence toward the many unwise demands of the laity 
on the one hand and the occasional college usurpation of 
authority on the other; it is evident, therefore, that the remedy 
lies in the application of psychological principles in the reor- 
ganization of the high school curriculum, as a prerequisite to 
a maximum efficiency. 
That there are expressions of discontent, for which the high 
school curriculum is primarily responsible, from the honest 
and capable reformer down the line to the fashionable dabbler 
in social and public matters, all are aware. We often wonder 
how it is possible in this scientific age that so many educated 
men and women are willing to generalize from a single par- 
ticular, when that particular reflects discredit upon the high 
school. This does not mean, however, that the general atti- 
tude toward the secondary school is unfriendly. The people 
have unbounded faith in high schools—a faith which resolves 
itself into a demand. In answer to this demand, resisted at 
first, but finally yielded to with enthusiasm, we have a multi- 
plicity of studies that the individual needs of each student 
may be met, affording the condition known as a crowded curric- 
ulum. The result of this over-pressure gave rise to the elec- 
tive system, which at one time seemed to satisfactorily dispose 
of all the difficulty. But it was thought by some that this 
system would not stand the test of the regrets of after life, 
and they substituted elective courses rather than elective sub- 
jects, in order that the course of study might not be thrown 
into a state of confusion and uncertainty. 
The question of the curriculum by this logical method 
divides itself into three parts, which are regarded as three 
independent questions, as follows: 1, Choice of the materia] 
to be used; 2, correlation in cross-sections of the curriculum, 
and (3) sequence of studies. By this method it is maintained 
that choice of studies must be settled on a purely objective
-P-A-G-E-455
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 455 
basis, determined by the civilization into which the child is 
born. After the culture material has been selected and co- 
érdinated, it is then turned over to the child-study people to 
do what is possible toward arranging it in proper sequence. 
It is now generally believed that this assumption is entirely 
wrong. It separates into three questions what is necessarily 
but one, and that one question is, what experience and subject- 
matter are best adapted to the pupil at the age of 13, 16 or 
17? We can therefore make no substantial progress by a 
logical proceedure; it is not a method for the study and solu- 
tion of the problem, but a method of checking the solution 
after it is obtained otherwise. 
This problem can be solved only by an earnest and un- 
prejudiced study of the realities with which education has to 
deal. These all center in the pupil, his development and 
growth. A closer and more scientific study of childhood and 
youth will put the matter of the curriculum in its proper 
perspective. The objective standard is the requirements of 
the civilization into which the pupil is advancing, in deter- 
mining what he shall study in school. We cannot determine 
the material to be used first, and then turn this assortment 
over, to have the student fitted to it. If the curriculum is 
made for the pupil and not the pupil for the curriculum, then 
our course of study can never be settled by logic or philosophy, 
but by a study of childhood and youth, and the requirements 
of the evolutionary stages of the civilization involved. 
To enumerate a few of the constants or fixed conditions, 
which reliable investigation has furnished, as the major con- 
siderations with which the secondary curriculum has to deal, 
gives a necessary hypothesis for any reasoning at all sug- 
gestive in the matter of improvement. 
First, the greatest loss from school is sustained at the ages 
from 13 to 15; second, that a too large per cent of our school 
population leaves at the end of the sixth grade; third, that 
the business world is not strong in its demand for employees 
of this age; fourth, that two-thirds or three-fourths of those 
who prematurely leave school, do so of their own accord, 
rather than from necessity, and these as well as others who 
drop out later in the course assign as a reason for so doing 
a lack of motive afforded by the grades witnessing their with- 
drawal.
-P-A-G-E-456
  456 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The crucial point of the whole system appears to be the 
seventh and eighth grades. From the standpoint of the pupil, 
these two years do not. seem to be an integral part of the 
elementary school, nor of the high school of which he yet 
knows nothing, neither do they meet the demand from a voca- 
tional viewpoint. Hence, may not the assumption be well 
founded, that they satisfy none of these demands fully when 
attempting to meet all three at once? Our problem, therefore, 
in the reorganization of the high school curriculum involves 
a provision for the seventh and eighth grades. 
France, Germany, England and Japan are committed to 
the policy of a six-year elementary and a six-year high school 
course, which takes the proposition out of the realm of specu- 
lation and entitles it to consideration on a practical basis. 
We are mindful of the fact that the four-year high school, 
with its traditional setting, and the alleged additional expense 
incident to this addition of two years to the secondary school, 
are seemingly centers of opposition to the change; but in 
comparison with weightier considerations to follow, no valid 
reasons are found in their support. 
It is well known that the increasing number of boys and 
girls who are out of school from 13 to 17, crowding to the 
danger point the ranks of unskilled labor, while the ever-grow- 
ing demand of the industries for trained labor is satisfied: in 
smaller and smaller degrees, has given rise to the problem of 
vocational training, whose solution educators and industrial 
leaders are uniting in an effort to determine. 
The doctrine formerly prevailing that up to and including 
the eighth grade, the needs of all pupils are identical, is fading 
away in the light of modern discoveries, resulting from the 
study of the necessities of individual pupils and the causes 
underlying their too frequent withdrawals from school. This 
is shown by the introduction of the elective principle, and 
the provision of a five or six-course program of studies. 
This theory may be admitted as holding for the elementary 
school, if, and only if, the first six grades are included; -an 
idea that is rapidly gaining support. In 1905 the National 
Educational Association appointed a standing committee on 
a six-year high school course of study. This committee has 
been reporting annually that a constantly increasing number,
-P-A-G-E-457
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 457 
who are in a position to know what can be done, declare that 
six years under good conditions are quite sufficient for the 
realization of the aim of the elementary school; that there 
seems to be a growing agreement throughout the civilized 
world that in such a period the child, with proper teaching, 
can acquire that command of the tools of communication and 
that adjustment to the world of the present and the past, that 
he is prepared to take up higher studies or for entrance upon 
life’s activities. 
Time forbids the introduction of many arguments in sup- 
port of the six-year high school, and permits the use only of 
what I shall call two of the strongest from a psychological 
point of view. 
G. Stanly Hall’s life work has given us the proof of the 
proposition, that at about the end of the sixth grade, the 
beginning of the adolescent period, represents the new birth 
for the higher and more completely human traits; at this 
period self-consciousness makes itself manifest. Interests 
that formerly prevailed are supplanted by new motives. Logi- 
cal reason begins to assert itself, and the mind is no longer 
satisfied with mere empirical facts, but demands also essen- 
tial relations. The child’s whole nature calls for less restraint 
and new isues. In the language of Calvin O’Davies, “The 
beginning of adolescence is most emphatically the beginning 
of the period of secondary education, and the organization and 
administration of our high schools today absolutely ignore 
this fact.” 
A second advantage to be gained is found in the fact that 
the beginning of many high school subjects is made possible 
at a time when the mental processes involved are most active; 
such, for example, as foreign languages, where forms are 
mainly concerned, with memory as the dominant faculty; also 
the more elementary parts of algebra and geometry, with 
emphasis on the transition from arithmetic to algebra and 
construction work in geometry, as a substitute for the waste 
of time formerly sustained in the study of the obsolete and 
traditional parts of arithmetic. 
This scheme naturally provides for the division of the high 
school course into a junior and senior period of three years 
each. By virtue of its order in the series and its function as
-P-A-G-E-458
  458 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
the proposed remedial agency, the curriculum of the former 
claims first attention. In it provision should be made for at 
least four different groups of pupils; 1, those who desire to 
climb the educational ladder to its topmost round; 2, those 
whose ambitions are limited to the second story of the educa- 
tional system; 3, those whose circumstances make their period 
of school life wholly uncertain; and 4, that group whose bent 
and inclination is factually vocational. 
This grouping suggests that not fewer than five well-cor- 
related courses of study should be offered in the junior high 
school: The college preparatory course, embracing English, 
foreign languages, mathematics, science and history; the gen- 
eral course, requiring some one major subject, with sufficient 
minors to give opportunity in many fields of learning; the 
commercial course, with emphasis upon those branches that 
relate to business practices and administration; the manual 
training course for boys, and a domestic science course for 
girls. 
In making this provision for a choice of work in line with 
the pupil’s aptitudes and desires at what may be called the 
supreme moment in his career, made so by the demands in his 
physical reorganization, calling for new situations and new 
conquests, is to do nothing more than to recognize and incor- 
porate into our secondary school curriculum the broadest, 
most clearly established educational principle that has yet 
appeared, as a result of the combined efforts of all the par- 
ticipants in the constructive field of educational endeavor for 
the past twenty-five years. While on the other hand, to ignore 
its claims for recognition would seem to place on those respon- 
sible for high school conditions the stamp of conservatism 
whose future had exchanged places with a past so distant 
that from it the demands of the present can no longer be 
heard. 
To this, as to any plan suggesting a change in the organiza- 
tion of the school curriculum, there are, of course, numerous 
objections possible. Aside from the always present objection, 
that some favorite school machinery will be put out of com- 
mission, the opposition of some will be on the basis of ex: 
pediency. All the objections yet discovered concern its ex: 
pediency, not its possibility nor its practicability, in which
-P-A-G-E-459
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 459 
case the answer to all these objections is found in the follow: 
ing benefits promised. A larger number will be kept in school. 
All pupils, both those who leave early and those who finish, 
will be far better trained. The transition to the high school 
will be more satisfactory. And if at the same time it should 
be discovered that the school might use as a motive the power 
of industrial studies to stem the out-flowing tide of children 
and hold them long enough to better fit them for the demands 
of industrial life, while at the same time it increases the effec- 
tiveness of all other subjects, nothing is more certain than 
that the American public will show an allegiance to high 
school administration by investing its management with pro- 
fessional rights and privileges involving a recognition of its 
field as one of highly specialized endeavor. 
The reorganization of the three years’ work comprised in 
the senior high school carries with it neither new problems 
from an administrative standpoint nor additional difficulties 
in the matter of instruction; but on the contrary, by afford- 
ing a more adequate preparation in prerequisite subject mat- 
ter, as well as a student body dominated by a keen and abid- 
ing interest in an unfinished series of potential attainments, 
many of the existing undesirable features of our four-year 
high school will be eliminated. 
The senior high school serves yet a larger purpose by pro- 
viding for a rational disposition of the erstwhile “educational 
scrap pile” resulting from the abuse of the “elective system” 
in its application to secondary school work. 
By providing elective courses in the junior high school, 
where the larger experience of the student with high school 
subjects enables him, when aided by the maturer judgment of 
his instructors, to choose wisely, we have made possible an 
intelligent application of the principle of election throughout 
his senior work. 
From what has been said all too dogmatically on account 
of the time limit imposed, I trust it is clear that the plan 
suggested would hold more pupils in school for a longer 
period; would better prepare all classes of students for what- 
ever further study they might wish to take up, or for what- 
ever vocation they might choose; would make our system of 
education more nearly consistent with the established theories 
 
-P-A-G-E-460
  460 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
and facts of psychology and pedagogy; while if the work as 
outlined be efficiently done, the incoming students to the 
senior high school will have developed a much needed serious- 
ness of attitude towards their work, as opposed to the present 
plan when students straggle into the high school in small 
numbers from many schools, wholly lacking in anything ap 
proaching a feeling of group responsibility. 
And thus we have the high school, “the people’s college,” 
transformed in its structure and function, freed from tradi- 
tional inheritances both as to scope and purpose, and estab- 
lished on scientific educational principles representing the 
safeguard of democracy and the distinctively American con- 
tribution to our national system of education. 
WHY PUPILS WITHDRAW FROM HIGH SCHOOL. 
J. W. KUYKENDALL, FORT SMITH, ARK, 
Pupils withdraw from high school in about the same rela- 
tive numbers and for about the same reasons that they with- 
draw from the upper grammar grades. 
Studies of elimination of children from school made by 
Messrs. Thorndike, Ayers, and others, and verified by many 
of us by studies of our own school systems, have established 
two very significant facts when considered together. First, 
ninety per cent or more of the pupils entering school remain 
to the age of fourteen, which is the normal age for entering 
the first high school year. Second, forty per cent of the 
children entering school are to be found in the first year of 
the high school. The difference between the 90 per cent of 
fourteen-year-old children and the 40 per cent of first-year 
high school pupils represents retardation rather than elimina- 
tion. 
In my own city, a study of this question, covering four 
years’ statistics, develops these figures: Of the pupils enter. 
ing, there remain in school 98 per cent at 11 years old, 94 per 
cent in the sixth grade, a difference of 4 per cent; 98 per cent 
at 12 years old, 78 per cent in the seventh grade, a difference 
of 20 per cent; 97 per cent at 13 years old, 62 per cent in the 
eighth grade, a difference of 35 per cent; 93 per cent at 14 
years old, 54 percent in the first high school year, a difference 
of 39 per cent; 74 per cent at 15 years old, 36 per cent in the
-P-A-G-E-461

second high school year, a difference of 38 per cent; 56 per 
cent at 16 years old, 24 per cent in the third high school year, 
a difference of 32 per cent; 32 per cent at 17 years old, 18 per 
cent in the fourth high school year, a difference of 14 per cent. 
Note the manner in which the age curve differs from the 
grade curve. The percentages for ages 11 to 17 run thus: 
98, 98, 97, 93, 74, 56, 32, the distinct slump occurring after 
the age of fourteen. The percentages for grades 6 to 12 run 
thus: 94, 78, 62, 54, 36, 24, 18, making a fairly uniform de- 
cline. 
It is evident that the losses in the upper grammar grades 
and in the high school are due largely to the two elements of 
age and retardation. In other words, pupils first fall behind 
their fellows of like age and then, discouraged or dissatisfied, 
they withdraw from school. 
It goes without question that the increased earning capacity 
of a boy of fourteen or over, coupled with poverty on the one 
hand and a desire to earn money on the other, impels a large 
number to drop out of school. Especially is this true in the 
Southwest, where business is a keen competitor of the school 
for the boy’s time. The allurement of a salaried position is 
much more enticing to the 16-year-old boy who finds himself 
in the fifth or sixth grade than to the one of the same age 
who has already reached the second or third year of the high 
school and who sees in the near future his day of graduation. 
My observations, verified by those of my associates in school 
work, are that the one large factor in withdrawals from school, 
both in the upper grammar grades and in the high school, is 
the failure to make promotions or to obtain credits in a large 
portion of the work, causing the pupil to fall behind his class- 
mates and jeopardizing his graduation. 
The question of the causes of withdrawals becomes then a 
question of the causes of retardation. An investigation of 
the causes of retardation in 700 cases in the Fort Smith 
schools gives the following: 
Parental or Home Oauses.—Late beginning, 177; irregular 
attendance, 111; frequent moving, 107; lack of interest, 71; 
truancy, 2; cigarette smoking, 2; total, 470. 
Physical Causes.—Poor health, 66; defective eyes, 13; de- 
fective hearing, 3; nervousness, 8; total, 90. 
 
-P-A-G-E-462
  462 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Other Causes.—Naturally slow, 86; defective mind, 13; 
foreigner (inability to speak English), 6; low grading from 
other schools, 35; total, 140. 
It seems almost incredible that two-thirds of this retarda- 
tion is chargeable directly to parental neglect or indifference. 
Yet the fact remains that 466, exactly two-thirds of these 
700 backward children, have been deprived of their right to 
an equal standing with their fellows by the first four causes 
given above. If we add to these 90 from physical defects, 
which are no doubt largely preventable or curable, we have 
an aggregate of 560 pupils, or 80 per cent, who might have 
been saved valuable years of their lives by having had their 
due share of care and opportunity at the proper time. 
To fall materially behind one’s fellows of the same age is 
the forerunner of withdrawal from school. The parent who 
fails to take note of this in the early years of his child’s school 
life and to see that the pupil is regular in attendance and 
diligent in study is neglecting a prime duty to his child, for 
school opportunities come only once in life, each at its proper 
period in the pupil’s growth. 
Parents must be aroused to the realization that it is their 
supreme duty to their children to enter them in school when 
they are six or seven years old and to keep them in regular 
attendance. Parents and pupils must be made to see that 
irregularity of attendance must inevitably lead to failure of 
promotion, either at the next or some subsequent time. 
All avoidable or curable mental and physical defects must 
be removed. To this end, systematic and thorough medical 
inspection, and, when necessary, treatment at public expense, 
must be provided. Attention of parents should be at once 
called to all physical irregularities and imperfections. 
When these two reforms become operative, retardation and 
elimination will be reduced to a minimum. 
WHY PUPILS WITHDRAW FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL. 
LEO M. FAVROT, BATON ROUGH, LA. 
A limited investigation into pupil withdrawal in sixty-six 
small high schools, representing an enrollment below three 
thousand, reveals several interesting facts. These sixty-six 
schools, enrolled 2,932 pupils last session, graduated 248, and
-P-A-G-E-463
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 463 
lost by withdrawal 857. Hight per cent of the pupils enrolled 
graduated, and 28 per cent, not including the graduates, with- 
drew. It would appear, then, that three and one-half times 
as many pupils leave the high school before graduation as 
graduate from it. Reduced to another form, more pupils leave 
each undergraduate class in the high school each year than 
are graduated from the senior class. This is approximately in 
accordance with government statistics, which show that 12 
per cent of the high school enrollment are enrolled in the 
fourth-year class, and that approximately 30 per cent of the 
number enrolled withdraw each year. 
The determination of the cause of withdrawal is not always 
a simple and easy matter. Many principals sending reports 
found it difficult to classify some of the causes. Many they 
could not ascertain. Thus two per cent of the pupils enrolled 
in these schools last session withdrew for unknown causes. 
Again, causes frequently act codrdinately to bring about a 
pupil’s withdrawal. A young man fails in a study; he be- 
comes discouraged and sees no need of pursuing that study; 
he is strongly inclined, on account of external influences, any- 
way, to become an active member of society and to earn his 
own living; so he leaves school. It becomes difficult to clas- 
sify accurately the cause of his withdrawal. We shall make 
the attempt, however, to show the cause of withdrawal of 
26 per cent of the number enrolled, in the sixty-six schools 
from which reports were received for this investigation. 
CAUSES OF WITHDRAWAL, 
The motives prompting withdrawal may be divided into 
motives of necessity and motives of choice. Withdrawals aris- 
ing from necessity are grouped as follows: Necessity to earn 
a livelihood or to contribute towards the support of the fam- 
ily, 12 per cent; pupils kept at home by parents or stress of 
circumstances, 4 per cent; illness or physical defect (usually 
defect of vision), 3 per cent; change of residence, 15 per cent; 
total per cent of withdrawals due to necessity, 34. 
Students withdrawing from choice may likewise be divided 
into two groups, those allured by the attraction of some exter- 
nal influence and those repelled by some cause innate in the 
school system. It appears that one-fifth of the boys who with- 
draw are prompted to do so by a desire to earn money, that
-P-A-G-E-464
  464 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
many boys and girls are impelled to leave the smaller school 
for the larger usually by the worthy motive of finding a school 
or course of study better adapted to their needs, and that 
marriage and the attractions of society claim a large number 
of high school girls. Tabulated, these causes appear as fol- 
lows: Desire to earn money, 14 per cent; to enter a larger 
or special school, 8 per cent; marriage and the attractions of 
society, 8 per cent; total attracted away from school, 30 per 
cent. 
Of that group of withdrawing students repelled by some 
cause attributable to school organization or method of man- 
agement and comprising more than one-third of all the cases 
of student withdrawal in the schools investigated, a large 
number have withdrawn because they do not like school or 
because they have grown tired of school. Others have dropped 
out because they have failed of promotion. Others still have 
become discouraged because of the inability to do the work 
assigned. Another group have left school because these pupils 
were compelled to take some course or subject (frequently 
Latin) not to their liking. The number leaving the high 
school because of the infliction of punishment is negligible. 
Tabulated, the remaining cases of withdrawal appear as fol- 
lows: Indifference to school and distaste for school work, 
12 per cent; failure in school work, 11 per cent; discourage- 
ment due to inability to keep up, 8 per cent; dislike of par- 
ticular subjects, 4 per cent; total repelled by high school, 35 
per cent. 
I shall not attempt to draw unwarranted conclusions from 
such a limited investigation, covering only sixty-six small 
high schools and the withdrawals during a single session, but 
the foregoing figures tend to make clear two facts: First, 
the causes of withdrawal vary widely both with respect to 
nature and extent; secondly, the application of no single 
remedy is likely to cure the evil. 
If it is true, as appears from these figures, that one-third 
of the withdrawals arise from necessity, real or apparent, the 
remedy for withdrawals from this cause would lie in remoy- 
ing that necessity, and in demonstrating the higher necessity 
of attendance at the high school. If a high school student 
is called upon to become a wage-earner for the support of
-P-A-G-E-465
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 465 
the family, the State or organized philanthropy should step 
in to remove that necessity, and the apostles of higher educa- 
tion to prove and convince that a higher necessity is the com- 
pletion of the high school course. Withdrawal due to change 
of family residence comes about partly from the restless 
American disposition and partly as the result of peculiar in- 
dustrial conditions in many sections of the South. The lum- 
ber towns of the South usually have a shifting population. 
Here, too, the remedy lies partly in the hands of directors of 
industrial enterprises, who, it has been proven, get better ser- 
vice by furnishing attractive homes and surroundings for 
their employees and thus keeping them in their employ. Our 
social reformers should continue vigorously their campaigns 
for better and more attractive homes in the South. The 
proper medical inspection and sanitary precautions on the 
part of State and local medical authorities will reduce to a 
minimum withdrawals on account of disease or physical de- 
fects. Wonders have been accomplished by spreading the doc- 
trine of public hygiene and sanitation. 
Withdrawals due to the call of the world and society must 
seek its remedy largely in the establishment of new standards 
and ideals in our civilization. So long as society sets a money 
value on success and courts the clothes rather than the man 
within them, we may expect to find youth pursuing a golden 
phantom. So long as society admires and promotes the empty 
useless life of the social butterfly, we may expect young women 
to succumb to its allurements, and from this state, to enter 
upon matrimony with no conception of the duties and respon- 
sibilities that it entails. But social reformers are working 
on this problem. We need the united effort of worthy organi- 
zations, the church, the press and the school, to assist in sup- 
planting old ideals and spreading the doctrine of social ser- 
vice as the chief aim of the individual life. The school as the 
social and industrial center of the community, assumes a 
leadership that must be helpful in preventing withdrawal. 
Codperation between the school and industrial enterprises, 
whereby the latter will encourage the continuance of boys and 
girls in the high school, instead of inviting them to withdraw, 
should also be of material assistance in solving this problem. 
I have purposely laid considerable stress upon withdrawals 
30 
 
-P-A-G-E-466
  466 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
due to external causes, because, despite my profound respect 
and admiration for our wonderful modern school system, and 
my reverent faith in its enormous possibilities, I cannot be- 
lieve that school authorities can solve the problem of with- 
drawal on a pure basis of internal reform. Variety, breadth 
and flexibility in the curricula are very desirable qualities, 
and I believe that improvement along these lines will material- 
ly help to solve the problem. But I am not one of those that 
believe that the annihilation of Latin and substitution there- 
for of shopwork, agriculture and domestic science is the abso- 
lute panacea for the evil of withdrawal from the high school. 
To prevent many failures, regular systematic home and class- 
room study and application is the only remedy. The exam- 
ination system is not to blame because it reveals the fact that 
the students are ignorant. If, by changing our system of 
administration to make school attractive and prevent with- 
drawal, we offer easy courses or softsnaps and render the 
school inefficient thereby, we merely pave the way for ultimate 
withdrawal and expose our schools to deserved criticism. In- 
difference to school and distaste for its work is a frequent 
accompaniment of indifference to and distaste for any activity 
worth while. This may sometimes be due to the hookworm, 
but its remedy often lies in the exercise of greater control at 
home and in school, and in the development of a high sense 
of duty. Pupils get something valuable out of having to do 
things they do not like to do. 
Perhaps the greatest single instrument of service in pre- 
venting withdrawal, that which nearest approaches a cure-all 
for this evil, is the teacher. The genuinely interested teacher, 
who will plead with pupil and parent for the advantages of 
the school over the world and.society; the teacher of attrac- 
tive personality, to hold attention and interest in school mat- 
ters; the well-balanced teacher, whose judgment is to be 
trusted; the tactful teacher, who can ward off a threatened 
rupture; the patient teacher to help and encourage the weak 
and plodding; the sympathetic teacher to reach the timid and 
reserved; the firm teacher to enforce the laws; the positive 
teacher to see that the work is done fully and well; and 
finally, the teacher of dignified self-respect to command the 
respect of student and community. The right teacher can

withstand practically all the other forces mentioned, and serve 
as the counteracting force to prevent pupils from withdraw- 
ing from the high school. 
THE ARTICULATION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL WITH 
THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND WITH 
THE COLLEGE. 
PROF, TOM FLETCHER, AUSTIN, TEXAS. 
Any thing like an exhaustive treatment of the double articu- 
lation of the high school, as indicated in the caption, would 
involve an elaborate consideration of the course of study and 
function of the elementary school, the high school and the 
college. Such an intensive study of so extensive a field, on 
short notice and in a brief paper, is impossible. I shall merely 
attempt to point out a few of the obvious obstacles in the 
way of articulation and offer some suggestions that might aid 
in improving conditions. Perhaps I shall be able to stimulate 
a helpful discussion of the whole subject. 
THE ARTICULATION OF THD HIGH SCHOOL WITH THB 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. 
In 1905 the inspector of schools for the State of New York 
pointed out that it was the business of the elementary school 
to develop in the pupil the ability: 
1. To read the ordinary newspaper. 
2. To express in words the thoughts gained from reading 
or conversation. 
3. To express these thoughts in writing. 
4. To express, no matter how crudely, concrete objects by 
drawings. 
5. To perform ordinary arithmetical computations through 
common fractions. 
In addition the pupil should have some knowledge of United 
States history, geography and physiology. The content sub- 
jects are not to be stressed; it is drill in the formal subjects 
that is insisted upon. The function of the elementary school 
is to furnish the pupil with the tools for proceeding with his 
education. 
It will not do to concede that the sole function of the ele- 
mentary school is to prepare the pupil to go on with his educa-
-P-A-G-E-468
468 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
tion, if by that we mean, prepare him for the high school. 
Perhaps 80 per cent of the elementary pupils never enter the 
high school. Unless preparation for the high school furnishes 
the pupil, should he not enter the high school, the very best 
training for life, considering the pupil’s nature, environment 
and subsequent activities, we are not warranted in concluding 
that the elementary school has performed its function in pre- 
paring the pupil for entrance upon the high school. The ele- 
mentary school must give a large majority of the children of 
this country their only formal education; hence it is impor: 
tant that it serve the pupil’s needs first and incidentally pre- 
pare him for secondary work. The courses of the elementary 
school and the secondary schools should be so adjusted as 
to enable the elementary school to both prepare the pupil for 
life and the high school. If this is impossible, then certainly 
the emphasis should be placed upon preparation for entrance 
upon his subsequent duties. 
In the United States the period of elementary education 
covers from seven to nine years, eight years being the more 
usual time requirement. The South seems to be partial to the 
seven-year elementary school. 
Between the years of 13 and 15 from 20 to 40 per cent of the 
pupils in the Chicago and St. Louis school drop out. The with- 
drawals are most numerous in the sixth and seventh grades. In 
St. Louis 34 per cent of the pupils stop for no other assigned 
reason than the loss of interest. Every school superintendent is 
familiar with the disastrous desertion of school by pupils in 
the seventh and eighth grades. Reuben Post Halleck pointed 
out in 1905 that of the boys entering high school nearly one- 
half drop out before the second year. It is generally agreed 
that the number dropping out in the first year of the second- 
ary school exceeds that for any other year. Much considera- 
tion has been given to the problem of keeping pupils in the 
high school until they are entered upon the second year. Ex- 
perience has shown that, if the student can be kept in school 
until this point is reached, the chances are much greater that 
he will continue his work until graduation. A business enter- 
prise that permitted some 50 per cent of its raw material to 
go to waste would be doomed to failure from the very begin 
ning. When we consider that the State does not engage in
-P-A-G-E-469
JOURNAL OF PROOCHEDINGS. 469 
the educational business as a charity, but as an insurance and 
protective measure, it is well nigh a national calamity that 
so many pupils, especially boys, fail to take advantage of 
the educational facilities furnished by the State. 
Students of psychology and systems of public instruction 
have from time to time advanced reasons for this wholesale 
desertion of school work in the first year of the high school 
and the grades just preceding. Without doubt, there is a 
plurality of causes for the large number of withdrawals at 
this period in the course. It is safe to predicate as one of 
the causes the lack of articulation of the elementary school 
with the high school and of the high school with the elemen- 
tary school. This lack of articulation is due, in part, to the 
plan of organization of both the elementary school and the 
high school. 
Mr. C. O. Davis, writing in the Educational Review for 
October, 1911, insists that our plan of organization for ele- 
mentary and secondary schools is irrational and wasteful. 
It has no basis in history, psychology or logic, neither does it 
have the support of contemporary practice in other enlight- 
ened countries. y 
“The European practice lends no support to the policy of postponing 
the entrance upon secondary work until the completion of seven or 
eight years elementary study, or until the youth has attained the age 
of 14 or 15 years. Neither do the systems of foreign countries limit 
the typical course of secondary instruction to four years. Germany, 
France and England have provided secondary schools that have been 
organized on a basis of from six to nine years.” 
Mr. Davis goes on to say that our plan of administering 
educational work is psychologically ill-grounded. 
“The adolescent period begins usually at about the age of 12 years. 
With the dawn of this period come most notable changes in physical 
form, structure and function and most decided concomitant psychologi- 
eal changes. The interests that formerly held sway are cast aside. 
New motives stir, new aspirations fire, new goals beckon. Conscious 
logical reason begins to proclaim itself. The mind is no longer satisfied 
with mere empirical facts, but it demands that facts be presented in 
their essential relations. Individuality and restlessness develop; the 
purposes and necessity of restraint must be made clear and intelligible; 
if not, tacit rebellion ensues.” 
Mr. Davis develops a plan of organization. This plan pro- 
vides for a six-year elementary school and a six-year second-  
-P-A-G-E-470
  470 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
ary school, the main idea being to begin the enrichment of 
the course of study at or just preceding the adolescent period, 
when the pupil is becoming restless and desirous of trying 
new things. There seems no valid reason for rejecting this 
suggestion made by Mr. Davis, even though we are unable to 
approve his entire plan of reorganization. 
I cannot say whether it is due to fortuitous circumstances 
or premeditation that the South has tended to favor the seven- 
year elementary school. At any rate, by adopting the shorter 
period we have avoided some of the adolescent difficulties men- 
tioned by Mr. Davis, because a number of our pupils go to 
the high school and enter upon a course of study richer in con- 
tent at the beginning of the adolescent period. However, we 
have not, by any means, solved all the school problems grow- 
ing out of adolescence, nor does adolescence wholly account 
for all the difficulties surrounding the articulation of the 
secondary school with the high school; neither does it account 
entirely for the great loss of students from the seventh, eighth 
and ninth grades. As I have stated, there are a number of 
causes. 
It is a fact of common experience among school men that 
the promotion to the high school does not represent the easy 
graduated progress that is presented in passing from one 
elementary grade to another. The pupil promoted from the 
fifth to the sixth grade goes on with his work without a hitch; 
but the pupil on being promoted to the secondary school 
falters and gets on haltingly. On entering the high school the 
pupil is called upon to make too many adjustments. Often he 
goes to a new building and must adapt himself to new teachers 
and new methods of instruction; the departmental plan is 
followed and the pupil is thrown more upon his own resources 
in a new environment among strangers. The course of study 
is different and usually too much of it consists of new subject 
matter. In other words, there is a decided break or gap be- 
tween the secondary and the elementary school. 
The break in the course of study deserves special considera- 
tion. In Texas, and in a larger number of Southern high 
schools, it is customary to begin in the first year of the high 
school algebra, ancient history and a foreign language. Hence, 
if the student carries four subjects, three-fourths of his course
-P-A-G-E-471
  JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGS. 471 
is new to him. The pupil is unable to weave so much new mat- 
ter into the webb of his past experience; he lacks the apper- 
ceptive basis. It is true that he may have recently had United 
States history and arithmetic, but with the average teacher 
and the average pupil the relation between the information 
which he has and the new matter is not sufficiently brought 
out for the pupil to grasp these subjects in the light of what 
he knows. He does not apperceive algebra in its relation to 
arithmetic, and he does not tie the history of the remote past 
to the more intimate history of his own country. Of course, 
a number of schools are solving the mathematical difficulty by 
introducing some algebra in the last year of the elementary 
school. Even this does not bridge the gap between the elemen- 
tary course and the high school course; it merely aids in 
closing the breach. In many cases, perhaps some blame at- 
taches to the colleges, since a frequent requirement for college 
entrance is a foreign language, algebra and ancient history; 
and the college suggests that these subjects be begun in the 
first year of the high school. 
In order to promote the articulation of the secondary school 
with the high school both schools must make adustments. The 
following suggestions would, I believe, help to relieve the sit- 
uation: (1) The pupil must not be confined to monotonous 
drill for such a long period of time; (2) he must be intro- 
duced gradually to the high school plan of procedure and 
methods of teaching; (3) elementary methods of discipline 
must not give place abruptly to high school methods, but the 
pupil must be prepared by the introduction of some high 
school discipline into the elementary grades. The purpose and 
necessity of discipline must be made to appeal more and more 
to the reason of the pupil; (4) the higher grades of the ele- 
mentary school must be given a greater variety of content 
work; (5) the first year of the high school must not present 
to the pupil a long list of new subjects; (6) some 20 per cent 
less work ought to be required of first year students than 
in the succeeding years. All the codrdinating adjustments 
are to be coincident with the changes in the pupil due to 
approaching adolescence and the adolescent period itself. A 
variety of subject matter and the opportunity to express the 
developing individuality in making a choice from a number 
 
-P-A-G-E-472
  472 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
of electives is the imperative need of the adolescent period. 
This is the time for introducing the manual arts and voca- 
tional subjects so as to afford new avenues to the pupil for 
self-expression. 
ARTICULATION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL WITH THE COLLEGE. 
The question of the relation of the high school to the college 
is the phase of articulation that has received most attention. 
The American high school is of comparatively recent growth, 
but so rapid has been its development that it represents, to- 
day, probably the most important and influential part of our 
educational system. It is the people’s college and must serve 
the people’s needs. It is necessary to inquire into the func- 
tion of the high school. What should be its aim? 
President Pritchett, of the Carnegie Foundation, states that 
the function of the high school is: (1) The preparation of the 
great mass of students for citizenship in a democracy; (2) 
the preparation of a very small minority—3 or 4 per cent— 
for college. The N. E. A. Committee’s report on the articula- 
tion of the high school and college, which report was made 
at San Francisco last July, represents such a clear-cut, sane 
and comprehensive conception of the function of the high 
school, that I can do no better than quote it. It is as follows: 
“1. It is the duty of the tax-supported high school to give every 
student instruction carefully designed to return to society intelligent, 
able-bodied and progressive citizens. To this end certain work should 
be included in the course of every student whether or not he contem- 
plates entering a higher institution. The responsibility of the high 
schoo] in this matter cannot be delegated to the college because there 
is no guarantee that the particular student will actually go to college. 
“2. It is coming to be recognized that in a democratic society the 
high school has a distinct function. The high school period is the 
testing time, the time for trying out different powers, the time for form- 
ing life purposes. Consequently, the opportunity should be provided 
for the student to test his capacity in a fairly large number of rela- 
tively diverse kinds of work. 
“In the high school the boy or girl may very properly make a start 
along the line of his chosen vocation, but a final choice should not be 
forced upon him at the beginning of that career. If he makes a pro- 
visional choice early in the course, there should be ample opportunity 
for readjustment later in the high school. For this reason the require- 
ment of four years of work in any particular subject, as a condition 
of admission to a higher institution, unless that subject be one that
-P-A-G-E-473
  JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGS. 473 
may properly be required of all high school students, is illogical and 
should, in the judgment of this committee, be immediately discontinued. 
“3. Not only is it the duty of the high school to lay the foundations 
of good citizenship and to help in the wise choice of a vocation, but 
it is equally important that the high school should make specific con- 
tribution to the efficiency of the individual along various broad lines. 
In our industrial democracy the development of individual aptitudes 
and unique gifts is quite as important as the development of the common 
elements of culture. Moreover, hard work is to be secured not by in- 
sistence upon uniformity of tastes and interests, but by the encourage- 
ment of special effort along lines that appeal to the individual. Our 
education would gain in power and in virility if we made more of the 
dominant interest that each boy and girl has at the time. It would 
seem that some have come to believe the oft-repeated statement that 
the liberal should precede the vocational; but an organic conception of 
education demands the early introduction of training for individual 
usefulness, thereby blending the liberal and the vocational; for only 
then does the liberal receive its social significance and importance. In 
other words, the boy who pursues both the liberal and the vocational 
sees the relation of his own work to the work of others and to the wel- 
fare of society; whereas the liberal without the vocational leaves him 
a mere spectator in the theater of life and the boxes in this theater are 
already crowded. 
“4, Mechanic arts, agriculture, or household science should be recog- 
nized as rational elements in the education of all boys and girls, and 
especially of those who have not as yet chosen their vocation. Under 
the authority of the traditional conception of the best preparation for a 
higher institution, many of our public high schools are today responsi- 
ble for leading tens of thousands of boys and girls away from the pur- 
suits for which they are adapted and in which they are needed, to other 
pursuits for which they are not adapted and in which they are not 
needed. By means of exclusively bookish curricula false ideals of cul- 
ture are developed. A chasm is created between the producers of ma- 
terial wealth and the distributors and consumers thereof. 
“The high school should in a real sense refiect the major industries 
of the community which supports it. The high school, as the local edu- 
cational institution, should reveal to boys and girls the higher possibili- 
ties for more efficient service along the lines in which their own com- 
munity is industrially organized. 
“Our traditional ideals of preparation for higher institutions are par- 
ticularly incongruous with the actual needs and future responsibilities 
of girls. It would seem that such high school work as is carefully de- 
signed to develop capacity for and interest in the proper management 
and conduct of a home should be regarded as of importance at least 
equal to that of any other work. We do not understand how society 
can properly continue to sanction for girls high school curricula that 
disregard this fundamental need, even though such curricula are planned 
in response to the demand made by some of the colleges for women.”

I thoroughly agree with the foregoing statements. The high 
schools must prepare the boy for service in the community, and 
it is certainly necessary that the boy be prepared to make a liy- 
ing before he will be of much service to the community. The high 
school needs to do more toward fitting girls for their environ- 
ment so that they will represent an economical asset rather than 
a liability. The aim of the high school is not different from 
that of the college, except that the college undertakes to prepare 
its students for higher and more extensive service. 
From time to time secondary school men have severely criti- 
cised the colleges for their attitude toward the high schools. 
They have complained, with considerable cause, that the college, 
though drawing its students from the secondary schools, had 
made little effort to understand the needs and problems of these 
schools. Instead of trying to articulate with the high school, 
the college has usually attempted to prescribe the high school 
course of study to the minute details for those students who are 
to go to college. In laying down entrance requirements the 
colleges have failed to consider that the prescribed work which 
seems obligatory upon only the small number of students who 
expect to continue their education is, in reality, mandatory upon 
the whole high school student body. Especially is this true in 
the small high school where only one course can be offered. To 
complicate matters, we find different colleges making different 
demands, and the high school authorities have, through the 
domination of the college, turned their schools into cramming 
places rather than institutions for the education of boys and 
girls. It has been pointed out that the high school may by con- 
centrating upon one group of studies, prepare the student for a 
practical career, or it may, by concentrating upon a limited 
range of academic tasks, prepare a boy for college, but it is 
urged that it cannot do both. 
Dr. Henry 8S. Pritchett thinks that both these ends may be 
consistently compassed by the same secondary school; the same 
methods which make for efficiency in the preparation of boys and 
girls for college will make for efficiency in training boys and 
girls for their vocations. Provided both high school and college 
are vitally related to social conditions and needs, Dr. Pritchett 
holds that the high school cannot do otherwise than serve both 
these ends. It would, perhaps, be advisable to state the proposi-
-P-A-G-E-475
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 475 
tion so as to emphasize the duty of the college to do some adjust- 
ing in order to establish a vital relation to social conditions. 
The subject-matter and methods that will give the boy and girl 
the best training for their vocations ought to prepare them for 
college. If it does not, are we not entitled to ask whether the 
college is keeping pace with social needs growing out of modern 
conditions? The industrial, commercial and social conditions 
have changed so rapidly within a generation that it may be 
asked whether the curricula of the average college of arts fur- 
nishes the very best intellectual pabulum for fitting its graduates 
for social efficiency. Certainly, in the case of the young women 
who take the college course for the A.B. degree, it is very gener- 
ally agreed that they do not get the returns due them for the 
time and energy expended. 
Our colleges have been extremely conservative institutions, 
managed by conservative men. No class of schools has been so 
bound by tradition as the college. The elementary and sec- 
ondary schools, on the other hand, being close to the people, have 
yielded to popular demands, and, as a rule, these demands have 
been salutary. These conditions, however, have placed the high 
school between the upper and nether millstones. They have 
tried to meet entrance requirements and at the same time accede 
to popular wishes. The result has been that the high school 
has established satisfactory relations with neither the commu- 
nity nor the college. High school authorities have been too 
much handicapped in the preparation of their course of study by 
the limitations imposed upon them by higher institutions. 
While there is need of some standardization of high school 
courses, entrance requirements should be sufficiently flexible to 
enable the high school authorities to arrange a course of study 
best suited to the needs of their students, and, at the same time, 
feel comforted with the assurance that their graduates would be 
received into the colleges and universities. Any subject suited 
to the student’s needs and properly given ought to be accepted 
as entrance credit. 
The notion that certain subjects, especially the ancient lan- 
guages, furnish an indispensable training, is largely exploded. 
It is doubtful if the faith in the classics can be revived in this 
country. At any rate, people will have to be convinced that the 
classics provide a peculiarly valuable discipline that can be
-P-A-G-E-476
  
476 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
afforded by no other subject-matter. The colleges have long 
insisted on the ancient languages; but instead of time and expe- 
rience demonstrating the indispensable value of language study, 
the tendency has been constantly away from such subject-matter. 
We find in the lists of college requirements much evidence of 
compromise. When Latin cr Greek is required, it represents a 
concession to the “stand-patters ;” science is required to placate 
the “insurgents” and mathematics to satisfy the “pure reason- 
ers.” If the high school is to undertake to train the student so 
as to make him most efficient in his personal and social activ- 
ities, the classics must take their chances with the other subjects. 
This seems the only reasonable view. 
The high schools must break away abruptly from the gen- 
erally accepted nucleus of subjects. Languages, mathematics, 
natural sciences and social sciences serve a vital purpose in pro- 
viding the cultural element. Training in these subjects gives 
the pupil a broad basis for thought, but the practical subjects 
must be given a place and the emphasis must be shifted to the 
practical. It must be understood that a subject may be both 
cultural and practical. I am almost willing to concede that 
there is no secondary subject except English which, under all 
conditions, should be required of the high school pupil. Be- 
cause of its practical value, there is no substitute for English. 
There are a number of high school subjects, the value of which 
depends upon what follows. If nothing follows, a year’s or 
half year’s detached study is largely wasted. There must be 
organic continuity in training. No fortuitous checker-board 
arrangement of a course of study will meet either the general 
demand that society imposes upon all alike, or the particular 
purpose of the individual. The foregoing ideas are largely 
those of Abraham Flexner. 
I have no intention of condemning the elective system, and 
yet I know of no school policy that has been more abused than 
this self-same elective system. Nor is the abuse confined to the 
secondary schools; it is most seriously prevalent in the colleges. 
The small three and four-teacher high schools have, in many in- 
stances, in response to popular demand, introduced a number of 
practical courses, and at the same time have kept the nucleus of 
cultural subjects. The result has been a serious over-crowding 
of the course and the teachers, with corresponding inefficient
-P-A-G-E-477
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. ATT 
work. The small school must either confine its efforts to the 
cultural subjects, or else largely abandon those subjects and sub- 
stitute the practical courses. In the latter case their graduates 
will be excluded from college, unless the college adjusts its 
work to receive them. The larger high schools have permitted 
too much piece work in the selection of electives. The fault is 
not in offering electives, but in affording students the opportu- 
nity to select their course without limitations. It is a notorious 
fact that students choose courses from the most trivial reasons. 
The colleges are beginning to realize that absolute freedom of 
election is unsatisfactory, and that there must be safeguards 
thrown around the system. 
As has been pointed out, it is not the function of the high 
school to prepare students for college, any more than it is the 
duty of the college to prepare men for congress. College prep- 
aration is merely incidental. The secondary school teacher 
must prepare his students for service in the community; he 
must make them socially efficient. To do this he must search 
for the bent of the pupil, and must take into consideration the 
environment into which he is to go. 
It is not fair to place the whole blame for lack of articulation 
upon the college. Educational tradition and the high school 
teachers must assume a part of the blame. It is only recently 
that there has been any serious attempt to train teachers for 
giving practical courses. The high school teachers have been 
unable to teach subject-matter outside of the cultural courses. 
The colleges have done a great work in establishing standards 
and directing the high schools through the formative period. 
The college must cease to dominate the high school, but the high 
school teacher must be well trained in order to assume the 
responsibility and direct the destiny of secondary education. 
Recent history shows a strong tendency on the part of the col- 
leges to leave the secondary schools to their own devises. 
In 1642 Harvard College announced that, “When any schollar 
is able to read Tully or such like classical Latin Authori ex 
tempore, and make and speak Latin in verse and prose without 
assistance and decline perfectly nounes and verbes in ye Greek 
tongue, then may he bee admitted into ye college.” Last year 
Harvard so modified her entrance requirements as to accept the 
statement of the secondary school as to the training of the pupil,
-P-A-G-E-478
  A78 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
and reduced the subjects in which examinations are required to 
four. Of the four, English only is absolutely required, the other 
three being selected from groups of subjects. Last June the 
University of Chicago placed her entrance requirements at 
fifteen units, three of which must be English, but no lists of 
books for reading or study is prescribed. The only requirement 
is that the student shall be able to read and write English to the 
satisfaction of the department of English. It is required that 
the student continue the study of English for one-half year in 
order that the English teachers may determine his proficiency. 
The prescribed units for entrance into American colleges vary 
from three to twelve, with a strong tendency toward accepting 
any subject that has been properly given. Hence, the outlook is 
bright. The colleges are rapidly making adjustment to condi- 
tions. Partly as a result of understanding and partly as a 
matter of necessity, the higher institutions are modifying their 
relationship to the secondary schools. 
The N. E. A. Committee of Nine, in its report on a high school 
course of study last summer, indicates the trend of educational 
opinion. I commend the high school course of study presented 
by this committee to all teachers interested in secondary school 
work. I cannot give the course, as outlined, in this paper; but 
it represents, I believe, the ripest thought on the subject. If the 
recommendation of this committee should be followed and the 
colleges should make provisions for continuing the student’s 
educational program, the transition from the secondary school 
to the college would no longer present a serious problem.

RETARDATION: ITS CAUSES AND REMEDIES. 
DAVID SPENCE HILL, PH.D., NEW ORLEANS, LA. 
Our topic is better suited for a series of papers than for one 
brief exposition. It is worth while, however, to enumerate the 
well-known factors in retardation, for the complexity as well as 
the urgency of the problem does not diminish. Upon the solu- 
tion of the problem of retardation largely depends the success 
of our massive machinery for formal education, and the matter 
is of more practical than of merely academic importance, be- 
cause retardation means veritable waste in education. It has 
been estimated that sixteen per cent of educational funds 
throughout the country is being spent, although not altogether 
wasted, in behalf of children who are repeating the work of the 
grades—a sum of $27,000,000 spent, in fact, for doing work 
twice. In numerous cities the percentage of repeaters is higher 
than sixteen per cent. No one can estimate the greater cost in 
units of physical, intellectual and moral failure, or in terms of 
disappointment, sorrow and pain in the children. Retardation 
within the largest groups of children ever assembled together— 
namely, the pupils of the schools of America—is related to con- 
ditions of child-labor, pauperism, insanity, race conflict, crime 
and degeneracy, and is, therefore, of social significance and of 
interest to statesmen, physicians, ministers, and all citizens, as 
well as to educators. 
That systematic study into the nature, causes, and cure of 
retardation is imperative, seems obvious to one who reads cur- 
rent journalistic and monographic literature concerning retard- 
ation, slow progress, elimination, statistical methods and the 
proposed remedies. The agitation is likely to bring into prom- 
inence a host of alleged curatives which, like the nostrums of 
the quack, may be useless or dangerous.  
-P-A-G-E-480
    480 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
It is necessary to agree upon the meaning of the word “retard- 
ation.” By retardation in school is meant simply “over age 
for grade.” By general consent the normal ages for the school 
grades are, respectively: Grade I, 6 to 8 years; Grade II, 7 to 9; 
Grade III, 8 to 10; Grade IV, 9 to 11; Grade V, 10 to 12; 
Grade VI, 11 to 13; Grade VII, 12 to 14; Grade VIII, 13 to 15. 
If we assign the above meaning to the term “retardation”—. e., 
a disparity between the ages of the children and the grades 
intended for them, emphasis is laid upon the general result of 
certain factors in school life, rather than upon the processes that 
bring about the result. The contention of Messrs. Greenwood 
and Falkner (N. E. A. Report, 1909, pp. 182-192; 1910, pp. 
149-155) regarding the proper criterion of retardation, centers 
upon the question of whether we shall accept as a criterion the 
age-grade status or the rate of progress of the pupil. Green- 
wood’s objection that “revolution of the earth upon its axis 
cannot be taken as the unit of measurement, applied to the 
intelligence either of children or grown persons,” has weight, 
but in view of the logical steps to be taken following a census by 
the age-grade method, the use of false measures should not be 
charged against its advocates. The disposition of a doubtful 
case of retardation should not be finally determined until ade- 
quate psychological, medical, and sociological investigations 
follow the age-grade determination. The retarded child may 
or may not be an exceptional child. The report of the commit- 
tee of the N. E. A. (1910, p. 322) emphasizes the necessity of 
discriminating the different types of exceptional children and 
of making provisions for these. Exceptional children may be 
sick, blind, deaf, or lame, and vicious, incorrigible or truant, 
with dull or with bright mantality, and not vicious with dull or 
with exceptionally bright mentality, etc. Falkner’s compari- 
sons of the actual amounts of retardation indicated both by age 
and by the progress standards in Boston and in Kansas City, 
show that the age-standard results indicate less retardation than 
the progress standard when the records of children who com- 
plete eight grades are considered. Unjustified, therefore, is the 
added charge that the age-grade standard causes an exaggera- 
tion of the amount of retardation. The age-grade standard of 
Ayres and Cornman seems entirely practical for the purpose of | 
preliminary and quick census. It is easy and expedient, how- 
ever, to compute the retardation by both methods.
-P-A-G-E-481
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 481 
Since retardation is caused in part by late entrance, it is also 
asserted that the evil of retardation is generally neutralized by 
rapid progress following late entrance. Appeal here should 
be made to fact. Available figures show that about one-third 
of retardation is caused by late entrance. However, systematic 
observations have not proved that as a rule children who enter 
late are able to catch up with the child who enters early, 
although there is a tendency for pupils who start late to make 
a little more rapid progress than those who enter early. Here 
are the records of progress of sixteen thousand New York chil- 
dren, each of whom started in first grade:

It may occur that the number of children making slow prog- 
ress is far greater than the number making rapid progress. 
Careful estimates are that in the average city eight times as 
many children make slow progress as there are making rapid 
progress. 
The extent of retardation will vary with the school and the 
city. Comparative statements in current reports are mislead- 
ing, because of lack of uniformity in computation as regards 
methods and time. In a large, typical school of Nashville, I 
found the average retardation to amount to 28 per cent or to 68 
per cent, respectively, according as six or seven years was con 
sidered the age of entering. In New Orleans we find the average 
in the schools for white pupils to be 49.6 per cent. This is upon 
the six years’ standard, and where the basis for the census was 
the number of names upon the roll the day the information was 
obtained. The last birthday was taken as the age—a procedure 
that introduces an error resulting in a slight underestimation of 
the actual amount of retardation. 
The causes of retardation may be grouped into two classes— 
" late entrance and slow progress. The Russell Sage investigation 
31  
-P-A-G-E-482
    482 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
revealed that of every hundred retarded, thirty were retarded 
by late entrance, thirten because of late entrance and slow prog- 
ress, and fifty-seven on account of slow progress alone. The 
factors in slow progress are the main causes of retardation. 
Excessively slow progress is not a condition affecting merely a 
small number of feeble-minded children, for it involves the 
majority of the pupils, the teachers and finance. One fifteen- 
year-old boy or girl in the fourth grade may become an impedi- 
ment and a burden, and may suffer also. He or she becomes 
out of place, and finally is eliminated to join the vast throng 
with whom the school is a failure. Retardation is a clue also 
to prevalence of sickness, physical defects, and may indicate 
shifting from school to school, absences, lack of interest, poor 
teaching, and sometimes the stress of deplorable home condi- 
tions. 
A small percentage of the pupils in city school systems have 
been found mentally defective in the sense of backwardness. 
Here the small number of morous, imbeciles and even idiots help 
to swell the number of the technically retarded. If slow prog- 
ress be correlated with extreme individual variation in the 
matter of mental functions, in such cases this is a matter for 
careful and sympathetic investigation by means of physical and 
mental tests, supplemented by a knowledge of the history and 
environment of the child—a work that should be undertaken by 
skilled and kind hands. 
It is easy to think of many other possible and more prevalent 
causes of slow progress and retardation. Unfortunately 
opinion, guess-work, debate or indifference have often either 
paralyzed our efforts to ascertain the true causes or led us into 
reform efforts of the crude kind. Despite the lives and the vast 
-sums of money at stake in education, we do not always rely upon 
quantitative measurement as we would in less serious undertak- 
ings of business. | We may review, briefly, some of the more 
commonly known causes of retardation and some proposed 
remedies. 
Irregularities in attendance are a cause of slow progress and 
the cause is obscured in reports which base percentages of 
attendance upon average enrollment or even average attendance. 
Ayres’ calculations for duration of attendance, for one-fourth, 
less than one-half, less than three-fourths, and more than three- 
 
-P-A-G-E-483
JOURNAL OF PROOEEDINGS. 483 
fourths of the year, show that in many cities less than three- 
fourths of the children enrolled continue in attendance three- 
fourths of the year. Persistent disclosure of status of actual 
attendance by reliable statistical methods might aid to bring 
the school and the community into better coéperation, and there- 
fore lessen the evil of irregularity in attendance by destroying 
complacency over existing conditions. 
Related to slow progress is elimination, which is excessive at 
the age of fourteen and fifteen. Though a boy may enter late, 
say at nine years, if he is retarded he will probably. drop out at 
about fourteen. Age has been found to be a strong factor in the 
matter of elimination. The studies of Thorndike and of Ayres 
vividly exhibit the increasing elimination from the first grade 
through the high school. Stated conservatively, the tendency 
in city school systems of America “is to carry all of the children 
through the fifth grade, half of them to the final elementary 
grade, and one in ten to the final year of the high school” 
(Ayres). It is important for us to secure the facts in each 
community as accurately and as soon as possible. 
For example, if experience shows that one in every 500 of our 
population is actually feeble-minded and needs protection, segre- 
gation, study, and, if possible, training in special institutions, 
then we must find such of these unfortunates as appear in the 
lower grades and treat these children with the greatest of care 
and most exact discrimination. Once the number and identity 
of the technically retarded is known, it is possible to sift out the 
various kinds of retardation, and in these cases of extremely sub- 
normal children there should be entire and organized coépera- 
tion between physician, teacher, consulting psychologist, sociol- 
ogist and parent. The work of research in behalf of the sub- 
normal child should be undertaken by our colleges and univer- 
sities, and also by educational laboratories maintained by school 
boards and manned by specialists. Organizations of this kind 
are effective in Chicago, Philadelphia, and New York, and the 
movement is beginning in the South. It is expected that the 
new psychological laboratory being established at the H. Sophie 
Newcomb Memorial College of Tulane University may find a 
place for this kind of work in the largest city of the South. An 
opportunity in many cities is open for codperation in behalf of 
the unfortunate child, the feeble-minded, the truant, the incorri-
-P-A-G-E-484
  484 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
gible, upon the part of physicians, trained psychologists and 
teachers, in connection with the schools, juvenile courts and 
individuals. 
As important as the discovery of the congenitally feeble- 
minded in early years may be, yet the institutional provision for 
protecting such boys and girls from the evil-doers and evil-doing 
also is of grave significance. Such individuals can never com- 
plete the work of the grades. Under proper environment they 
may be trained to manual activities in part yielding self-support. 
Orphanages, pauper houses, insane asylums, jails, are improper 
places for the feeble-minded children or adults. Their custody 
in suitable institutions, such as at Vineland, N. J., relieves the 
schools of their sad presence and makes possible a degree of 
happiness and of self-support for them. There, too, without 
injury, they are made subjects of psychological study; they 
there are segregated and society is protected from the menace 
of men and women with strong impulses, weak inhibitions and 
feeble intelligence. Goddard’s charts showing ancestry and 
progeny of typical cases of this class are impelling evidence 
that we need more and better organized efforts at research, as 
described, and also that the State, or private philanthropy, 
should establish training schools for the feeble-minded, for the 
fourfold purpose of (1) segregation, (2) study, (3) self-support, 
(4) and humane care. When one contemplates the number of 
such people of both sexes who fill the long caravan that passes 
annually into jails, houses of prostitution, or who live abroad as 
social parasites, one would think that our statesmanship in the 
South would at once provide both for the discovery of this hope- 
Jess condition early in life among our massed children, and also 
for the scientific care and segregation of these unfit beings. 
Because ill-health and physical defects are related to retarda- 
tion and general development of the child, the school today 
needs help from the best physicians. Adequate medical inspec- 
tion of school houses and of school children, by specially trained 
physicians and nurses, has never been abandoned where once 
tried in large cities. But there is a dearth of doctors who know 
educational science. This is due to the fact that doctors are 
not trained as teachers, and also to the fact that most medical 
students in America have relatively less academic training than 
students in other than medical schools. For example, the per-

The increasing and united activities of bogus health move- 
ments, mind-cures, medical cults, and faddists, in their efforts to 
modify and even prevent State control of health measures, is 
added reason for the choice only of specially trained physicians 
in dealing with our school children. And the noble medical 
profession should see to it that not one child suffers because of 
lack of money to pay. It is a gratifying symptom that such 
institutions as the University of Pennsylvania and the Tulane 
University, of Louisiana, are offering special courses in school 
hygiene for physicians and students. 
With all our training of teachers, let us not omit to train 
them to conserve the physical and mental health of the child and 
of themselves. Preventable and remediable physical conditions 
cause some of our retardation. The States should, in our 
normal schools, demand courses in school hygiene for prospective 
teachers—i. €., (a) hygiene of the child, (b) of instruction, and 
(c) of administration. In the case of one public normal school 
of the South, for years school hygiene, a persistent candidate 
for the required course of study intended for elementary teach- 
ers, met defeat to give place to trigonometry! For a normal 
school to neglect accurate instruction by trained men and women 
in school hygiene in its scientific aspects is a violation of sound 
pedagogy, and often means diversion of public funds to useless 
ends. Many obvious things need to be done at once to safe- 
guard the health of pupils and teachers, such as building of 
school houses to relieve congestion, improvements of illumina- 
tion and heating, removal of the common drinking cup, sanita- 
tion of closets, and the installation of screens where flies and 
mosquitoes abound. 
Too much work in the grades is one cause of retardation. 
Available figures indicate that in a score of cities it takes more 
than eight years for the average child to complete eight grades. 
This is a condition significant because it points plainly in such

cases to the need of adjustment of courses of studies and of 
methods to the capacities of the average rather than of the 
brighter pupils. Flexible grading, the Cambridge plan, the 
Batavia plan, reduction of passing limit, reduction of size of 
class-room mass, semi-annual or quarterly promotions, free 
electives, special credits for high quality of work, classification 
according to physiological age, segregation of exceptional chil- 
dren, the assignment of skilled and well-paid teachers to the 
lower, crowded grades rather than assignment of tyros in teach- 
ing, separation of boys and girls, more emphasis upon old- 
fashioned virtues of industry, the use of the rod, or, on the other 
hand, a soft, pink-tea type of pedagogy—are samples of various 
remedies proposed to facilitate progress and promotion, rem- 
edies, some of which are good, some bad. 
By the way of summary, let us single out nine concrete meas- 
ures which are worthy of serious consideration in seeking the 
causes and applying the remedies for retardation : 
(1) Provision for regular and scientific tabulation of the 
number of the retarded, of those making slow progress, of the 
repeaters, and of the beginners in every school in the respective 
states. Permanent and accumulative records should form an 
essential part of the system. Here exists an opportunity for 
State Superintendents of the South to emulate upon a wide 
scale the beginnings made by progressive city superintendents 
of the South. 
(2) Adequate medical inspection, utilizing physicians and 
skilled nurses with pedagogical training, and with attention to 
certain tried health measures, such as open-air schools, baths, 
and supervised playgrounds. 
(3) Educational laboratories for the study and observation 
of exceptional children. 
(4) Special teachers, special classes, and day schools for back- 
ward and disciplinary cases. 
(5) The control of the increase of defective minds and of crim- 
inals by the permanent segregation of imbeciles and feeble- 
minded in institutions where they may receive kindness, some 
training in.self-support by industrial activity, and be utilized 
for scientific research. 
(6) Normal instruction in school hygiene in its modern 
aspects by educational specialists.  
-P-A-G-E-487
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 487 
(7) Compulsory education laws which will adjust the permis- 
sible age for leaving school with the length of the course of 
study intended. 
(8) Campaigns of education to arouse a sane sentiment in 
behalf of our schools and coéperation of parents and citizens. 
This should be undertaken by responsible persons through the 
press, general literature and lectures. 
(9) Publicity of abuses which long remain neglected or unre- 
moved. The public schools belong to the people, not to boards, 
superintendents or principals, societies or churches, and the 
people have a right to know the facts—but let us protect the 
people from the muckraker, or the sensationalist seeking only 
an avenue of self-exploitation. A persistent publicity of the 
necessary facts in regard to our school business got fairly, peri- 
odically, should, in the long run, secure deeper interest in, and 
better financial support for, our efforts gradually to change 
thousands of children into men and women of the best human 
types. 
RETARDATION. 
H. F. TRIPLETL, SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS, BEAUMONT, TDXAS. 
While I cannot add materially to the close, thoughtful pre- 
sentation of the salient features of “Retardation” by Dr. Hill, 
asa practical schoolman I wish to emphasize some of the points 
_ presented by the speaker. In this practical discussion of Dr. 
Hill’s logical address, I can but crave this body’s indulgence. 
In view of their importance, I believe that a further considera- 
tion of points affecting retardation, as to causes and remedies, 
may be worthy of notice. 
As retardation makes a strong appeal to all who are interested 
in school preparation for life, the related subjects of non- 
promotion and school elimination are worthy of equally serious 
consideration. These three questions are so intimately inter- 
woven that they cannot be treated independently. The diffi- 
culty of individual treatment lies in the fact that they are une- 
quivocally related, and that neither one can be universally 
assumed to be causal. 
One reason for the failure of our school thinkers and philos- 
ophers to settle upon methods of dealing with these problems in 
the past decade of Committee, Commission, and Association con- 
sideration, is found in the over-shadowing prominence given to  
-P-A-G-E-488

each at stated times. This treatment of these subjects is on a 
par with the procedure of the locally famed disciple of Escula- 
pius, who dosed his patients into “fits,” and then cured the “fits” 
because that was his therapeutical “long suit.” His treatment 
was heroic and left but few burdens on society, for the under- 
taker saw that all his mistakes were hidden, and all responsibil- 
ity was chalked off to that “Divine Providence” that “both gives 
and takes away.” 
But the pedagogue practicians who diagnose school ailments 
on the unitary basis by throwing all into an epileptic category 
of non-promotion, elimination, or retardation, and then making 
that didactic diagnosing the basis for a heroic treatment that 
thwarts spirit convalescence, have no sextons to cover the results 
of their school malpractice, and have no Divine Providence 
sponsor; so society in general, and children in particular, must 
suffer irreparably under the sway of such doctors of didactics. 
As retardation and its two related subjects cannot be specific. 
ally treated, it becomes important to note things and conditions 
that cause either, and also to note things and conditions that are 
incident to each, though not necessarily causal in nature. Any 
school that has a high record of non-promotion has a high record 
of retardation, and also a high record of school elimination. 
In my “second-hand” research I found nearly corresponding 
ratios prevailing. In my experience, a twice-retained pupil has 
generally been a two-period retarded pupil, and he does not 
finish his course. A pupil two years older than his classmates 
seldom has the pluck to finish a course under the depressing 
conviction in his mind and in the minds of teacher and pupils 
that he is not at par in mental quality. If all concerned know 
that his school status is the result of enforced school absence by 
reason of sickness or labor demands, this feeling of mental infe- 
riority is often lacking and the pupil may have sufficient nerve 
to finish his school course. 
An authorized summary of statistics of elementary schools 
from 1,024 cities of the United States gives 19.1 per cent in first 
year work, 15 per cent in second year work, 14.5 per cent in third 
year work, 13.6 per cent in fourth year work, 12.2 per cent in 
fifth year work, 10.3 per cent in sixth year work, 8.4 per cent in 
seventh year work, 6.2 per cent in eighth year work, .7 per cent 
in ninth year work.

In the four Texas cities, San Antonio, Dallas, Houston and 
Beaumont, the percentages for the seven years‘of the elementary 
schools for 1909 were as follows: 28, 17, 16, 14, 11, 8 and 6 per 
cent. Making due allowance for city growth, this shows an 
elimination of over 52 per cent of the pupils of elementary 
grades of the average city school, and a slightly higher per cent 
in the Texas cities mentioned. 
In the elementary city schools boys are in excess in the first 
four grades, while girls are in excess in the last four grades, 
showing a decidedly greater elimination of boys than of girls. 
Of the pupils in twenty-three representative United States 
cities, on basis of first-year enrollment, 10 per cent were elim- 
inated in the first three years, 9 per cent were eliminated in the 
fourth year, 14 per cent were eliminated in the fifth year, 14 
per cent were eliminated in the sixth year, 14 per cent were elim- 
inated in the seventh year, 13 per cent were eliminated in the 
eighth year, 1 per cent were eliminated in the ninth year, 10 per 
cent were eliminated in the first year high school, 5 per cent 
were eliminated in the-second year high school, 4 per cent were 
eliminated in the third year high school, 6 per cent reached the 
senior year of high school. 
On the basis of retardation in a representative city (Cleve- 
land) there was the following condition: 10.7 per cent of the 
first year were retarded pupils, 19.3 per cent of the second year 
were retarded pupils, 29.3 per cent of the third year were re- 
tarded pupils, 34.55 per cent of the fourth year were retardea 
pupils, 39.37 per cent of the fifth year were retarded pupils, 
35.62 per cent of the sixth year were retarded pupils, 24.81 per 
cent of the seventh year were retarded pupils, 18.37 per cent of 
the eighth year were retarded pupils. 
On an average, 25.35 per cent of the elementary schools were 
retardation cases. From a consideration of these reports we 
conclude that a normal promotion will do much towards secur- 
ing normal continuity in class attendance and non-retardation. 
The reasons given by a competent authority for non-promotion 
are: 1. Irregular attendance, 21 per cent; 2. Incapacity, 56 
per cent; 3. Indifference, 12 per cent; 4. Other things, 11 per 
cent. 
Indifference can be overcome by any first-class teacher. With 
indifference overcome and interest begotten, a regularity of

attendance is almost sure to result. If these two elements of 
school sucess are attained, incapacity will be converted into 
capacity, and 90 per cent promotion may prevail. Supt. P. W. 
Horn, of Houston, asserts that if a normal pupil, who is regular 
in attendance and properly classified, is not promoted, the fault 
lies with the teacher. Thoughtful supervisors are of his opinion. 
A competent investigator who sought reasons for retardation 
from seventy-six city superintendents found forty that counted 
inefficiency of teachers as the main cause; fifty who attributed 
retardation to irregular attendance; fifty-seven to late entrance ; 
twenty-eight to too many classes; thirty-three to crowded class- 
room; and sixteen to half-day sessions. 
These seventy-six education experts reported the following 
remedial measures, as indicated: Fourteen have special “catch- 
up” classes, ten have vacation schools for non-promotion pupils, 
sixty-six have special attention given to pupils liable to fail, 
forty-five give special attention to retards of last term, twenty- 
five give part of each day to pupils liable to become retards. 
These remedial measures are rational and have been satisfac- 
torily tested in many school systems. 
Of 100 pupils in each grade of New York City schools, it was 
found that an average of seven per hundred were in advance of 
their age-grade, while forty-five per hundred were not up with 
their age-grade, and only forty-eight per hundred were normals 
in their age-grade. The average school will present near the 
same conditions. The remedy for these adverse conditions lies 
in a readjustment of school courses by the elimination of non- 
essentials and the intensive consideration of a central educa- 
tional element. 
The fundamentals in education are being crowded out by a 
multiplicity of things our age seems to demand. Teacher- 
directed electives can be managed in the elementary schools 
so as to give full employment to extra alert pupils and normal 
advancement to slower pupils, and all managed with due re- 
gard to modern demands upon’ the school. A course in its en- 
tirety should not be alike for boys and girls. While granting 
that girls in their early teens are more alert mentally than 
boys, and that women are men’s equals in ability to master 
college subjects, it is no argument for college co-education, nor 
of an equality or inequality in the mental grasp of men and
-P-A-G-E-491
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 491 
women. It is man’s province to conquer adverse forces and 
subdue the natural and political world. If he does this he has 
not the surplus energy to keep up standards of culture, of ethics, 
of aesthetics, and of intoning social conventionalities. These 
are in woman’s realm today, were yesterday, and will be to- 
morrow and forever. Art and beauty, music and literature, 
hearthstone cheer and heart satiety, spirit impulse and sym- 
pathy support—these the world must have and these woman 
alone can give. 
If left to a free choice, is there any hesitancy of boys and 
men, of girls and women, as classes, as to what that choice has 
ever been, will ever be, between mathematics and composition, 
history and rhetoric, logic and literature, economics and art, 
fulcrums and flowers, transits and trousseaus? Courses should 
discriminately allow subjects that give to boys initiative, power, 
poise; to girls, sagacity, prudence, charm. 
An attention to the following cautions and suggestions may 
lead to minimizing retardation and its correlatives. Over- 
stimulation of young entrants may kill later interest. Stren- 
uous work during pubescent period is physiologically and psy- 
chically baneful. Sense appeals after thought; grasp attained 
weakens thought power. The “thoroughness” fetich is as fate- 
ful in school as the Oriental’s in worship. Hither otiose or 
attenuated teaching will kill spirit interest in the most earnest 
class. Conserving physical soundness and remedying physical 
defects produce magic class results. A curriculum that has 
both basic and supplementary conditions affords full employ- 
ment to both bright and dull, and gives each equal advance 
units. Promotion on “points” gives little trouble and saves 
one-sided pupils. 
The establishments of a social center with its attendant com- 
munity enlistment in child and school welfare practically saves 
the day for real teachers, and will eventually eliminate retarda- 
tion and its correlatives. The continuous school session, having 
three terms, two of which complete the year unit of work, and 
only two of these terms open to normal-age pupils who have 
made this year unit, will solve the problem before us, if true 
teachers are uniformly employed. 
I close these suggestions with a reference to the “no sex 
in education” fallacy. As previously indicated, every public  
-P-A-G-E-492
  492 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
school course should be so electively formed that the relative 
need of boys and girls could be rationally and practically met. 
Every librarian knows the vast difference between masculine 
book-lists and feminine book-lists. This difference is as marked 
among adolescents as pre-adolescents; as marked among society 
swells as society fledglings; as marked among “left overs” as 
among impossibles. Librarians recognize this sex mentality ; 
the Y. M. C. A. and the Y. W. C. A. recognize it; all civic and 
social workers recognize it; but school teachers have never 
dreamed of it, or if they dreamed of it they never interpreted 
it in life wroughting. A few schools have caught its meaning, 
and are blessing their pupils and society by allowing a cor- 
responding mind development in industrial expression, and 
every school where this sex-directed expression has been 
allowed the retardation question has been nearly eliminated. 
Even in schools where this expression has been allowed, some 
of the teachers have missed the essence of the movement and 
perverted the desired leavening. What believer in this move- 
ment has not had woefully shaken his faith in pedagogue com- 
mon sense when he say girls working with boys in joinery wood- 
work practice one day and on the next day saw boys working 
with girls in the rafia department? Do not the retardation 
gods grin in glee when viewing a school with boys crocheting 
and girls carpentering? Even a Sioux Indian was never caught 
weaving nor his squaw scalping. 
Another sure stamp of a school of maximum retardation is 
seen in the primary or in the intermediate teacher whose story 
repertoire has its background and its foreground tinged with 
a Cinderella glow. What real boy does not long for knucks, or 
shinny, or bowing bouts, during this sissy exercise? Equally 
as ill-timed and as class depressing is the David and Goliath 
saturated story repertoire. What real girl does not long for 
ring-round-rosy, dolls, or dress parades during this boyish exer- 
cise? 
In mixed schools, and such are all public schools, class instruc- 
tion cannot be of a specific type for boys and girls, but teacher 
appeals can be indirectly made to boys or to girls. If a story 
or an illustration is of a type that largely appeals to girls, 
the teacher can address herself to them in an indirect way that 
will get from them a responsive hearing, and at the same time
-P-A-G-E-493
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 493 
make the boys feel that a critical hearing is not incumbent 
upon them. The same course can be pursued in claiming a per- 
sonal interest from boys, while allowing a personal respite to 
girls. Teachers often give their personal attention to an indi- 
vidual, or to a group, and indirectly allow an attention respite 
to others of the same division. A sex discriminative attitude 
in the school room is of equal pedagogic merit, and will tend 
to eliminate retardation. 
Masculinity, skill tests, sturdy rivalry, stoical scrappers and 
combative statesmen appeal to the male half of the world from 
the first day in school to life’s last day; while feminity, social 
diplomacy, esthetic sway, sympathy awards and “Four Hun- 
dred” achievements appeal to the feminine half of the world 
from the first doll tea-party to the last function preceding the 
“parting of the veil.” A Roosevelt and a Nightingale are of 
these types that form world ideals; but a Wilde and a Walker, 
though world acknowledged geniuses, being mental sex reversal 
types, are viewed by the world as caricatures. 
When teachers, curricula makers and school administrators 
heed these social and natural limitations that will and must 
control people, and accordingly develop the two great pupil 
classes to their respective superior efficiency, then retardation, 
retention and elimination of normal pupils who have had equal 
school-life privileges will become inconsiderable factors in 
school problems. The mal-administration of our schools in 
these particular differentiations, and that made manifest in the 
pronounced feminine trend in school life today, is not only re- 
sponsible for boy retardation, but for the more alarming status 
of boy school elimination. 
ESSENTIALS IN ELEMENTARY EDUCATION. 
H. H. RYAN, NATCHITOCHES, LA. 
It is not the purpose of this paper to discuss or even define 
all the essentials in elementary education. We shall, rather, 
take up only a very few things. Further, we shall touch the 
formal curriculum only very lightly, but concern ourselves 
rather with matters of an unconventional sort, so to speak, 
which are at least becoming as truly essential as the time- 
honored trio of R’s. 
The first consideration is that the elementary course should 
 
-P-A-G-E-494
494. SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
be composed of essentials. The elementary school should devote 
its time to the imparting of knowledge, skill, habits, which are 
of value to all children. Of the children entering school for 
the first time this year, only some forty per cent will ever 
be enrolled in a high school, and only ten per cent will ever 
finish the entire public school course. Only fifty per cent will 
finish the elementary course. No better argument is needed 
to establish the principle that the elementary school should 
rigidly apply itself to the problém of giving its pupils the 
maximum of educational equipment while the pupils are still 
in hand. The subject-matter of the curriculum must function, 
in the sense that it must be felt daily in the lives which these 
pupils will lead—these pupils of all degrees of wealth, ambition 
and mentality. It must all be of service to the child who is 
to drop out of school early and take up a life of drudgery; to 
the child who is to enter a calling at the end of his elementary 
course and begin an upward climb; to the child who is to 
continue his education for a number of years. 
No matter what his future may be, the child should learn 
here to learn. He should acquire the ability to get ideas from 
printed pages, with all the refinements of skill that this implies 
beyond the mere recognition of words. He should acquire posi- 
tive, accurate habits of reasoning, of noting the particular with 
a view to the general; of weighing evidence impartially; of 
applying a principle to a case in hand; of expecting and search- 
ing for relations of cause and effect. What a great number of 
children go through school under the impression that knowledge 
is an arbitrary thing in possession of a few stingy teachers and 
a few hazy text-books. We wonder how many children look 
upon our decimal numerical system as a thing sent down from 
heaven with the ten commandments, perfect in every part, in- 
stead of as a crude system of counting, evolved by man himself 
from the aboriginal practice of counting upon the fingers and 
toes. We wonder how many regard historical events as a series 
of unrelated happenings. Perhaps nothing is so valuable and 
hope-inspiring in the way of mental equipment as the feeling 
that everything is a result of something and a cause of some- 
thing, rather than a thing unto itself. This feeling is an essen- 
tial, taken along with the desire and the habit of relating facts 
in this way, one to the other.
-P-A-G-E-495

Long and bitter has been the controversy over the introduc- 
tion of industrial arts into the elementary curriculum. It has 
been the contention of some that a course of this kind merely 
takes up time without really teaching the pupil anything prac- 
tical in regard to industry. The fallacy of such a statement 
becomes evident when one sees the difference in rate of progress 
between the two classes of tradesmen—the one class composed 
of men whose knowledge of their trade depends upon mere 
imitation, and the other of men who see in their movements the 
scientific principles which underlie them. The former have 
but little hope of advancement, and are expensive and otherwise 
unsatisfactory to their employers. It is the latter class that 
the elementary school course in industrial arts aims to increase, 
not by teaching the prospective tradesman his trade, but by 
equipping him with industrial intelligence—the whys which will 
eventually make his hows more pleasant and more efficient. 
On the other hand, such a course does not set out with the 
deliberate intention of making a tradesman out of each and 
every pupil. To the future journalist, or lawyer, or capitalist, 
or teacher, or housewife, or society woman, it intends to give 
an appreciation of industrial problems, and a sympathy toward 
industry in general, through an actual contact in a simple way 
with the labor side of industry. A good course in industrial 
arts will include a discussion of such matters as the causes, 
purposes and fundamental principles of strikes; sanitary prob- 
lems in factories; protection against fire in factories; rights 
and wrongs of child labor. These and similar problems which 
touch such a large proportion of the population of the world 
are studied in the light of that around which they all center, 
the nature of the work itself. 
There is no dodging the fact that athletics will soon be re- 
garded as essential in elementary education, despite the abuses 
which admittedly occur in its administration. Some contend 
that competitive athletics can be of physical benefit to only a 
very few students. Without arguing this point, it can be estab- 
lished that athletic contests do not of necessity look to physical 
development for their entire justification. After the repre- 
sentative team has been narrowed down to a very small per 
cent of the student body, it is our contention that the team and 
its struggles are of incalculable value to the cause of education.

First, there comes to the players themselves the habit of con- 
ducting themselves according to law. Children respect the 
rules of a game as they do no other rules, and are quick to 
resent an infraction of such and punish the offender. Again, 
there is that greatest of benefits, the tendency of athletics to 
associate with the school strong feelings of pleasure, enthusiasm 
and loyalty, of a kind and degree that no other force gives 
rise to. It matters not that the origin of this feeling lies in 
a phase of the school life which has no relation to the three 
R’s. The feeling is undeniably there, and the school becomes 
attractive in the same way that the home does, not upon its 
own merits, but because of the emotions associated with it. 
One sometimes hears an objection like the following raised 
in regard to school athletics: “The children talk of football 
and baseball and basketball from morning to night. One would 
think there is nothing going on at school but ball games of 
one kind or another. Are we paying taxes to support athletic 
amusements or to support schools?” To such an inquiry we 
feel impelled to reply with another: “Before the introduction 
of athletics, did you hear the children talking arithmetic from 
morning to night? What was it they talked about from morn- 
ing to night? Was the conversation of the boys from morning 
to night of such a nature that they cared to carry it on in your 
presence?” Athletics, as a subject of discussion, is capturing 
the most prominent place in the thoughts of children, is not 
necessarily driving out of that place the literary activities of 
the school, for the very good reason that such literary activities 
normally never did occupy that place. Whenever a teacher 
finds a child who is intent upon studies in school and out, the 
best thing he can do for that child is perhaps to recommend that 
he see a physician. Those of us who know from experience and 
observation the nature of the talk which is displaced to a great 
extent from the boy’s daily life by the introduction of a fas- 
cinating sport, are very glad to hear that the game and the 
team are common topics. 
Teachers who have coached or managed school teams know 
what a tremendous hold such duties give one upon boys and 
girls who otherwise would be serious disciplinary problems. 
The child who cannot see that the teacher is really working 
hard for his interests in the prosaic affairs of the school room,
-P-A-G-E-497
en tT ae 
JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 497 
is drawn irresistably into a feeling of fellowship and common 
cause by the united efforts of teacher and pupil toward the 
winning of a baseball game. We need not concern ourselves 
over the psychological reason for it; be it that the game touches 
the child’s native interests more deeply; or be it that the game 
is a concrete thing, the desirability of which he can feel, while 
the literary accomplishment is desirable from his standpoint 
principally because he believes the teacher when she tells him 
it is; whatever be the reason for it, the truth of the phenomenon 
cannot be denied, and it were but foolish not to take advantage 
of it. This sympathy between teacher and pupil is the teacher’s 
most efficient piece of disciplinary machinery. 
Furthermore, the athletics should give the school a still more 
direct hold upon the scholarship of the pupil. This is accom- 
plished by making satisfactory scholarship a condition of par- 
ticipation in school athletics. This plan is followed success- 
fully by a great many associations of schools, colleges and ! 
secondary and elementary schools; and it serves in every case 
to raise the standard of both athletics and scholarship. In the 
Same way a certain standard of morals can be insisted upon— 
objectionable language can be discouraged and bad habits, like 
cigarette smoking, can be practically eliminated. The great 
advantage here again is that the reason for leaving off such 
habits is neither arbitrary nor abstract, but is capable of demon- 
stration, and is often unwittingly demonstrated under the eyes 
of the pupils by some stubborn boy. Pupils of both sexes are 
quick to notice the dullness, slowness and general inefficiency 
in sports which accompany dissipation of any sort. 
This leads us into the discussion of another essential in the 
elementary curriculum—moral training. This is perhaps the 
newest and yet one of the most vital features advocated today 
for all schools. One of the justifications for public education— 
for the taking of one man’s money to educate another man’s 
child—lies in the theory that the education thus administered 
tends to reduce criminality and foster general progress, thereby 
increasing for all the opportunity of enjoyment of life. Lately 
we have not been sure that the statistics of criminality support 
this theory, and there has been a consequent movement toward 
a better system of moral instruction. After all has been said 
in regard to such instruction from the standpoint of theory, 
32  
-P-A-G-E-498
  498 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
we still feel very deeply that the moral instruction that is to be 
felt in later life is that which is not labeled; that which is 
imparted without the intention of making the child conscious 
of the process, but rather with a view toward the formation of 
habits and intuitive or subconscious convictions as to right or 
wrong. Here arises a controversy similar in principle to that 
with respect to the study of formal grammar. Do we want 
children to speak correctly? We do. Ergo, some say, start 
them early in the study of grammar. But our past experience 
does not argue for such a program. Rather, say some, let the 
pupil acquire correct language through imitation and practice, 
trial, error and correction; let the dissection of the language 
come as a supplement to the real acquisition of proper speech. 
Again, do we wish pupils to cultivate a liking for good litera- 
ture? We do. How shall we accomplish this? By teaching 
them to understand it, by making them familiar with it. There- 
fore, say some, let us approach it with the attitude of a biolo- 
gist and rend it apart to display its internal anatomy; let us 
discuss it, bit by bit, and allow no significant word or phrase 
to escape us. To the supporters of this method it is not en- 
couraging to see the evident antipathy of high school and 
college graduates toward the best that has been written. Others 
say, let the love of literature be acquired through association 
with it, by unconscious growth in appreciation of its beauty 
as a whole. 
In the same way we want to suggest that the affections, the 
ideals, the principles of a little child are delicate things, and 
ill adapted to withstand the glare of comment. A healthy child 
has no desire to pull up his moral plant by the roots at regular 
intervals to see how it is growing. He rather prefers to let it 
grow, as any plant does, its vigor depending upon its environ- 
ment. Nobody likes a goody-goody, and who is the goody- 
goody? He is the individual who thinks he is good; whose 
virtue is verbal. It matters not whether his opinion is correct 
or not, the name sticks just the same. We love virtue; we hate 
its declamatory, dramatic representation. Let us say, then, 
that for the bulk of moral instruction it is the duty of the 
school to provide environment, atmosphere, example and oppor- 
tunity for conduct; that morality, of all things, is to be ac- 
quired by induction. The events of the school room, of the

community, and of literature will be useful. That these events 
will remain in the memory of the pupil merely as individual 
occurrences is unthinkable; that generalization will occur, that 
principles of conduct will take form, is inevitable; that the 
statement of these principles should follow their conception, 
and hence come late in the pupil’s life, we wish to stoutly main- 
tain. 
The elementary school is already making a somewhat bashful 
approach to the problem of instruction in sanitation and sex, 
and it is but a question of time until such matters will hold 
a regular place in the curriculum. Of the desirability of such 
we are already sure. It is the how which puzzles us. Perhaps, 
in order to make such instruction less verbal and more real, 
we shall enlist the services of the much-lamented cat and dog 
and guinea pig. Until our scheme of instruction in the effects 
of alcohol and narcotics is put upon a scientific basis, is cleared 
of the charge of intentional deception, and is made bona fide, 
it will continue to have only a temporary effect upon the pupil 
and to lose its influence as soon as the child becomes old enough 
to detect the fraud. In short, if morality strives to teach con- 
duct as it should be, depending upon facts and conditions as 
they are, then true moral instruction will have to be based 
upon things as we find them—the good things in the life of 
the human family, and the bad things, taken together with the 
causes which give rise to them and the effects which they pro- 
duce. We believe it to be self-evident that in the coming prog- 
ress in moral instruction the movement will be away from 
words, and towards acts, as a means of imparting principles. 
To sum up, then: 1. The elementary curriculum should be 
composed of essentials—matter of value of all classes of pupils. 
2. The ability to learn is the first essential. This involves the 
ability to read, and positive, accurate habits of reasoning. 
3. A second essential is industrial training, with a view to the 
development of industrial intelligence. 4. Athletic activities are 
essential as auxiliary forces to promote the better conduct of 
the school, as well as to give physical development and instruc- 
tion. 5. Moral training is essential and must be imparted 
largely through actual conduct; it must be, as the expression 
goes, “one the square.” 
All of these things seem to lead to the conclusion that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-500

atmosphere of the school should be like that of the world. 
Disciplinary methods should smack of the legal attitude; the 
school must be a place where real problems are presented and 
worked out, because of a need that is actually felt; the school 
must insist that the knowledge acquired in part of its work be 
regidly applied in every other. In short, the school must lead 
the child gradually from his protected existence in the nursery 
to a life in the world, through a series of grades, each of which 
smacks less of the nursery than its predecessor, and more of 
the life into which he is to be projected. 
CONSOLIDATION OF RURAL SCHOOLS. 
N. R. BAKER, MONTGOMERY, ALA. 
In common, perhaps, with almost all authors appointed to a 
task, the author of this paper endeavored to ascertain what 
others have thought and written, with the result that he finds 
there is no paucity of arguments or exiguity of material upon 
the subject of consolidation of schools. 
We discovered a total of forty treatises upon the subject from 
thirty-four different States, aggregating 1,652 pages of printed 
matter. We found arguments ranging in number from five in 
one bulletin to twenty-seven in another. We found, further- 
more, a range in printed matter from a small eight-page leaflet 
to a book of 135 pages, as compiled by the Supervisor of Rural 
Schools of North Carolina and issued by the Department of 
Public Instruction of that State. In all these there is neces- 
. Sarily much duplication of argument, as each writer seeks to 
put before his readers the salient points of the system and the 
most convincing arguments for its adoption. All these argu- 
ments must, however, necessarily resolve themselves into three 
general reasons: 1, Improved teaching and closer supervision ; 
2, the enrichment of the curriculum; 3, better socialization of 
the community. 
1. It is self evident that better teachers may be secured for 
a consolidated school. Teachers tend to gravitate naturally 
to the larger schools. This is for two reasons; the wages are 
better and there is a wider sphere of usefulness. There is an- 
other reason alluring those who do not really deserve promo- 
tion—the work looks easier. To the real teacher it is not 
easier, but the vision of fewer grades and fewer recitations con-
-P-A-G-E-501
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 501 
stantly lures the inexperienced and the one who possesses the 
fewest amperes of energy. 
But the gulf between the one-room school and the larger con- 
solidated school is usually the parting of the ways between the 
poor teacher and his more worthy brother. A higher class of 
trustees impose higher qualifications upon an already higher 
class of applicants. In fact, with good wages, the cost of living 
much less, and distractions fewer in the country, first-class 
teachers may be attracted away from larger city schools. Again, 
as a rule, the larger the school the better the supervision, pro- 
viding the unit of supervision is not too large. There is closer 
supervision by the superintendent and better supervision by 
the principal while at school, and there is at least some form of 
supervision usually on the way to and from school where trans- 
portation is employed. The length of time is greater, it is con- 
tinuous, the attendance is more regular, and the best city 
methods are in vogue. 
2. The vitalization and enrichment of the curriculum is of 
supreme importance. Music, drawing, domestic art and domes- 
tic science, manual training, agriculture, including horticul- 
ture and floriculture, are all possible and practical in the large 
consolidated school. In fact, any vital community interest may 
be added to the school activities. The recitations are longer, 
friendly rivalry is stronger, ideals are higher, equipment is bet- 
ter, laboratories are possible, lyceum and other intellectual 
attractions available. 
3. The “spelling bee” of our fathers not only served its pur- 
pose in teaching them to spell words often already obsolete, but 
it afforded opportunity for the young to learn manners and the 
old to become better acquainted. 
The consolidated school enlarges the community, widens the 
social unit, and places the best standards of this larger sphere 
within reach of all. No longer must the home be broken up 
and the twelve or thirteen-year-old child sent away to school. 
The large number of pupils in the transportation wagon is a 
moral protection to each. This bringing of city conditions and 
city school work into the country tends to break down the 
barrier between city and country. As some one has said, “It 
is the only school which proposes to educate the country boy 
without disturbing his home relations.”  
-P-A-G-E-502
    502 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Even though the consolidated school may cost more, it yet 
saves more to the community in that the cost to high school 
pupils is but a small fraction of what it would be to send them 
away. It makes possible clubs, literary societies, reading circles 
and, in short, encourages the larger socializing of the larger 
social unit. Convinced as educators all are of the propriety of 
consolidated schools, two phases of the subject remain to be dis- 
cussed, viz. : 
WHEN (1) AND How (2) TO CONSOLIDATE. 
The writer traveled recently through a county in Alabama 
where the prevailing type of school was a two-room school and 
where the one-room schools were four or five miles apart, al- 
ready quite large and connected by bad roads. In such a place 
consolidation is not yet feasible. These sparsely settled com- 
munities are quite numerous in the South and hence the area 
for practical consolidation is greatly limited. But this con- 
dition need not discourage the more favored communities. 
There are places where small schools are close together and 
should be united. The writer knows of one school in his own 
State of but four pupils within two and one-half miles of a 
large town, with a local train running exactly right for trans- 
portation, yet no attempt at consolidation is made. Such a 
waste of public money is culpable and inexcusable. 
The State of Kansas had 286 schools with five or fewer pupils 
in 1908, according to the report of State Supt. E. T. Fairchild. 
Suppose these averaged four pupils each, the total cost per 
pupil was $20 per month. Compare this with the cost of edu- 
cation in many cities, where the total cost per pupil is only 
$20 for the nine months’ session. And yet the city has the bet- 
ter schools notwithstanding the eight-fold greater opportunities 
in the country schools. Superintendent Fairchilds’ report 
show further that 3,518 teachers are employed to teach 35,000 
country children. This is enough teachers for a city of a 
million inhabitants, though the number of pupils taught would 
not indicate a city of more than 225,000. In other words, for 
poorer service the country people pay four to five times as much 
for their schools. 
The writer personally knows of few places where consolida- 
tion has been made. But let one such serve as an illustration
-P-A-G-E-503
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 503 
in closing this paper. The Hamilton neighborhood, in Mobile 
County, Alabama, now has a good consolidated school, includ- 
ing one year of the high school work. The conditions are as 
follows: At a certain cross roads, one of the roads fork so 
as to make what may be known as the “Five Points.” Here 
there was once a school. The house decayed and failing to 
agree as to where to rebuild, the community was divided, and 
two small buildings constructed about two miles apart and 
each about a mile from the cross roads. After a few years both 
were struck by a tornado and damaged. It was then suggested 
that instead of repairing, a new two-room building be con- 
structed back at “The Points,” and require these schools to re- 
unite, and also afford transportation to another school three 
miles away. The statistics of the consolidation may be given 
about as follows: 
Before-—Number of pupils, 58; average number to teacher, 
20; average number grades to teacher, 7; time devoted to each 
grade daily, about 43 minutes; cost per month for teaching, 
$150; total cost for teachers for 7 months, $1,050. 
After ConsolidationNumber of pupils, 66; average number 
to teacher, 33; number of grades to teacher, 4; time devoted to 
each grade daily, 75 minutes; cost per month for teaching, $110; 
cost per month for transportation, $30; total cost for school, 
8 months, $1,120. 
Thus an eight-months term was conducted, costing but $70 
more than the seven months term under the old plan. Fully this 
amount was saved in fuel and other operating expenses, and 
in less depreciation in the value of the property. But there 
was a further saving. There were ten pupils in high school 
grades. If their parents had been compelled to send these chil- 
dren away to boarding school their expenses at only $20 per 
month would have amounted to $160 each, or $1,600 to the 
community, all of which was saved. Besides, the community 
employed better teachers and fell heir to all the other advan- 
tages of consolidation. 
In conclusion, allow us to suggest that there are two agencies 
that should, in our opinion, be enlisted where consolidation is 
desired, but where there are obstacles in the way, such as 
prejudice against new movements, false sentiment about giving 
up the old school, or fear of depreciation of land values. Those

agencies are the school improvement association and the near- 
est normal school. The normal school especially should cham- 
pion consolidation, and should labor to convince patrons and 
embryo teachers of its benefits. By selecting several local 
schools in the vicinity, and giving them special attention from 
president down, they ought to be able to produce enough leaven 
to eventually permeate the whole lump. Through these agencies 
teach the community that it is better to have a good school 
four miles away, than to have a sorry school in one’s front yard. 
CONSOLIDATION OF RURAL SCHOOLS. 
CARL HARTMAN, HUNTSVILLE, TEXAS. 
It would be idle in the few minutes allotted to me in this 
discussion to dwell upon the value or the need of consolidated 
schools. The principles of consolidation now find universal 
aceptance among the well-informed; and no one who knows 
anything of rural school conditions doubts that there is a cry- 
ing need for the improvements which consolidation will bring 
with it—in buildings, in equipment, in the quality of ihe 
teaching. 
I wish, however, briefly to call attention to several points often 
overlooked in discussions of this subject. Ifa person desires to 
read up on consolidation, he will consult one or more of the 
many bulletins or reports of which Superintendent Baker has 
spoken, and in them he will find accounts of five and ten-thou- 
sand-dollar school buildings in the country, fully equipped, well 
graded and organized, and with lines of wagonettes to carry 
the children to and from school. And when he gets through 
reading, the chances are that he lays the pamphlet aside and 
says, “That’s all very fine, but it won’t work here.” Consolida- 
tion on a large scale, with transportation, is devoutly to be de- 
sired, but it is my opinion that we have not sufficiently stressed 
the fact that the advantages of consolidation will, to a large 
extent, also accrue to consolidation on a small scale. I am, 
therefore, very glad that Mr. Baker brought before us in his 
paper just such a case of consolidation, whose example will 
prove of most practical benefit just at this time. There has 
been in the past an undue multiplication of schools, resulting 
in the great number of schools of fewer than:ten pupils of which 
the other speakers have told us. Many of these schools should   
 
-P-A-G-E-505
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 505 
never have been organized. It is my observation that these 
miniature schools are lifeless affairs. A strong one-teacher 
school of thirty to forty pupils is much better on the average 
than a school of five or ten or fifteen pupils. The small schoo] 
lacks that real factor of interest, the inspiration of numbers, 
and in the greatest majority of cases must content itself with 
the poorest teacher on account of its paying the poorest salary. 
The only excuse for the existence of these very weak schools, 
where circumstances make them necessary, is the fact that they 
are better than no schools at all. Such schools should never 
be encouraged by extra appropriation over and above their 
per capita share, except in cases where insuperable obstacles 
prevent their consolidation with neighboring schools. I con- 
tend that more good will come out of this consolidation move- 
ment if school boards and county superintendents will lend 
greater efforts toward the consolidation of these smaller schools, 
even though only a large one-teacher or at most a two-teacher 
school results. There may be less glory in effecting a score of 
such changes than in erecting one $10,000 “graded county high 
school,” but in the aggregate as much good will be done. Such 
consolidations on a small scale have also an immeasurably bet- 
ter chance of being carried out when once agitated. 
The negative phase of this question, already touched upon, 
namely, the prevention of undue multiplication of schools, is 
also a point of practical and immediate importance. When 
school patrons fall out, one faction withdraws and demands a 
school for their children alone. If the center of population 
of the school district shifts, occasion is made for a part of the 
district to ask for a new school. In all such cases the easiest 
thing for the central authority to do is to give the people what 
they want, regardless of what is best for themselves, their chil- 
dren or the State. There is need everywhere for a strong county 
contro] of such school matters, at least for the absolute veto- 
power vested in the county school authority. The thing most 
needed is not more schools, but the strengthening of those we 
already have. 
It has been pointed out that in this country the people rule, 
especially so in school matters. It becomes important, there- 
fore, that the people be informed on school questions, and con- 
solidation offers no exception to the rule. Can you expect the  
-P-A-G-E-506
  506 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
people to take the initiative in this matter? When you con- 
sider that the movement is comparatively recent even among 
school men, can you expect such a plan to be originated among 
the people of the communities where the industrial, social, re- 
ligious and educational conditions of twenty-five or fifty years 
ago still obtain? Wedded as they are to tradition and attached 
to the little unpainted school house of the roadside, can you 
expect the people to carry out consolidation of their own ac- 
cord? Circularize them? State and county superintendents, 
universities and A. & M. colleges, the U. S. Department of 
Agriculture and other agencies are doing that; and their work 
is valuable in the sense that sowing of seed is valuable. 
Valuable as the free literature on consolidation of schools is, 
the gentleman who has just spoken is right when he says that 
- it takes personal evangelism to bring about results. It may 
be said that there is such a personal worker preaching the doc- 
trine of consolidation in the person of every local school teacher. 
And indeed the teacher has had, and will have, a large part to 
play in the spread of the movement. But it is my experience 
and observation that the local school teacher cannot be relied 
upon to take the initiative in introducing such a far-reaching 
innovation as is involved in the “shutting down” of the very 
schoo] she may herself be teaching. The average teacher is too 
ignorant, or afraid, or too busy, or unwilling to start the move- 
ment. Who, then, is the person to start things in these dis- 
tricts so afflicted with inertia? I want to submit to you that 
the only man we need to rely upon is the county superintendent 
of schools. This officer makes or mars the educational advan- 
tages of his county. My information is to the effect that where- 
ever much has been done in the way of consolidation, it is the 
county superintendent who has brought it to pass. The gentle- 
men who have preceded me in this discussion can bear me out in 
this, for, as assistants to their respective State superintendents, 
they work continually with and through their county super- 
intendents. 
If the county superintendent is a politician rather than a 
school man; if he is more intent upon holding his job than 
upon rendering service; if he cares more for votes than for the 
lives and aspirations of the children committed to his care; if 
he masks ignorance and cowardice behind the emblems “Let
-P-A-G-E-507
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 507 
the people rule,” his county will be without consolidated schools. 
But a man who has his heart in the right place and a well- 
stocked and well-trained head on his shoulders; who considers 
the rendition of service a privilege and a duty; who has con- 
victions and the courage to stand by them; who is filled with 
the missionary spirit and a faith in mankind; who has the 
backbone and good sense to say, “No,” whe nnecessary and 
wise—such a man will bring about improvements and will con- 
solidate schools. He will do this not by circulars, letters or 
columns in the county papers, but by personal campaigns, day 
and night, summer and winter, with teacher, parent and tax- 
payer. The office of county superintendent is the strategic 
point in this movement. I therefore submit to you that the 
one best way of bringing about consolidation more speedily 
is by strengthening the office of county superintendent. To 
do this the salary should be more adequate, at least as much, 
if not more, than that of the county officers, for a better salary 
materially increases the chances of the county to secure a 
highly qualified man to fill this important office. The office 
should furthermore be made appointive, as in the cities, so as 
to avoid, in the maximum of cases, getting a mere politician 
to fill the office. And lastly, the county superintendent in the 
larger counties should be relieved of his clerical duties, for it 
is manifestly foolish and unbusinesslike to employ a highly- 
trained and high-priced man to do routine work. This man, 
I conclude by saying, should not be too small to overlook the 
big movements that he might introduce into his county and 
induce his constituency to accept; nor should he be too big 
to overlook the more modest problems in the neglected and 
remoter parts of his territory.

THE GROWTH OF THE KINDERGARTEN IN 
THE SOUTH. 
MISS MYRA WINCHESTER, FT, WORTH, TEXAS. 
When we were little children we loved to stand with our backs 
to the door-post once a year and have our height measured, and 
the number of feet and inches recorded and compared with the 
previous year’s record. We liked also to speculate on what the 
next year’s measure would probably be. It was a good ex- 
perience. It is an experience which we do not tire of repeating ; 
for that reason we never get over liking to measure our growth. 
Hence, arises our interest as teachers in verbal and printed re- 
ports concerning the increase in the total number of kinder- 
gartens in our section of the country, the number of training 
schools, the number of students in these schools, the number 
of cities having public school kindergartens, and so on. 
As we acquire years and wisdom, we learn that some phases 
of growth are neither measureable nor recordable. We begin 
to understand that there is a distinction between growth and 
development, and that the series of marks on the door-post, 
however agreeable and gratifying, do not serve to tell us of 
the invisible progress made, of the gradual unfolding of powers, 
and of insight. 
In considering, then, the growth of the kindergarten in the 
South, we shall do well to bear in mind this distinction and 
to note not only the quantitative extensive increase, the figures
-P-A-G-E-509
       JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 509 
and facts that can be counted and tabulated, but also the 
qualitative intensive development, less obvious than size and 
numbers, but none the less real and vital. It is not my purpose 
in this paper to deal with statistics, interesting though they 
be. The reports of our officers give us numerical details in con- 
cise form, and we can study them at our convenience, and be 
encouraged by them. Rather do I wish to discuss: 1. Two 
of the factors which are potent in fertilizing and shaping the 
kindergarten in the South (indeed in America) ; 2. The prob- 
able direction of our future expansion and our responsibilities 
therewith connected. 
1. Of the factors which make for growth, we should recog- 
nize first what may be called Hatension of Motherhood. Grad- 
ually we are coming to understand that motherhood is some- 
thing far more than a relationship between parent and child. 
Motherhood is a quality, an attitude of mind, a spiritual prop- 
erty possessed by men as well as by women. Our entire country 
is being touched and penetrated by the spirit of motherly nur- 
ture and earnestness. It is this which is responsible for the 
establishment everywhere of agencies for the better care and 
understanding of children. The child welfare movement, the 
National Congress of Mothers, the Visiting Nurses’ Associa 
tion, the Playgrounds Association, and so on, with their va- 
rious branches are directly monted by the sense of nurture 
stirring in the hearts of motherly men and women. 
The kindergarten owes its visible existence to this fertilizing, 
fostering impulse; for the needs of helpless little children have 
never failed to bring a tangible response from society. And so 
then have sprung into being various instrumentalities through 
which the mothering instinct has raised itself into conscious- 
ness, and reached out to bless. Church societies, social settle- 
ments, kindergarten associations, and other forms of private 
benevolence, have brooded and nursed into healthy life our kin- 
dergartens, and the kindergartens have brought with them a 
train of other good things for children. 
Paternal government we Americans fight shy of; but the 
maternal attitude in society we rejoice in and plead for its con- 
tinuance. If the first factor in our growth is the mother- 
element of humanity, the second factor may be termed the 
mother-in-law. The first gives us our being, and the second
-P-A-G-E-510
  510 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
helps to shape and direct us. Criticism is its other name. Some- 
times the criticism is harsh, undeserved and ignorantly applied; 
always is it productive of good results in the long run. To be 
sure our spirits sink under the sense of disapproval. We fear 
set-backs and failures. Consciousness of obstructions and 
dread of defeat make us heavy-hearted. But since we have be- 
gun and lived through so many threatened disasters, we have 
begun to recognize the existence and meaning of the two forces 
at work in the universe, the centripetal or closing-in, and the 
centrifugal or raying-out. And we learn that the drawing in 
process is necessary and is really preparatory to a fresh outflow 
of strength and vitality. So we comfort ourselves and reread 
our Browning with keener appreciation than ever before of his 
“Then welcomes each rebuff 
That turns earth’s smoothness rough, 
Each sting that bids not sit nor stand but go! 
Be our joys three parts pain!” 
Criticism (the mother-in-law of society) therefore has taught 
us to be gratified for the exposure of our weaknesses and errors, 
since censure tends to make us less bumptuous, more wise, and 
more zealous to reform the abuses that constantly creep in 
among us. Criticism is making us look well to the hygiene of 
our kindergartens, to the improvement of conditions which 
affect the physical child. It is stirring us up to be better 
psychologists, to be sensibly scientific in our ideas and methods. 
It is rousing us to understand wherein lies our responsibility 
for bringing about a closer relation between the kindergarten 
and the graded school. 
2. This suggests the second point, the direction and charac- 
ter of our future development. Looking back over two decades 
of kindergarten in the South, we see how its numerical strength 
has increased, and also how there has been a steady advance- 
ment in public sentiment and intelligence. This advancement 
has taken the shape of a definite sequence like the following: 
First, there were private kindergartens, regarded as more or 
less of a luxury for the children of well-to-do people. Second, 
the motherliness of good men and women began to provide 
“charity” kindergartens for the poor and neglected children, 
and churches and settlements and kindergarten associations 
gave and continue to give glad and generous support to such
-P-A-G-E-511
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 5ll 
kindergartens. Third, as a direct outgrowth of the work of 
kindergarten associations there have evolved training schools 
for young women, established primarily to fill an immediate 
need, and continued since because they have become their own 
excuse for being. Fourth, the State Legislature has been in- 
duced to pass a bill making it legal to institute public school 
kindergartens. Fifth, local boards of education have partially, 
then entirely, taken over the care and education of little chil- 
dren. And sixth, the State and city normal schools have incor- 
porated the kindergarten training schools, making them into a 
regularly integrated department. 
Thus we see that the path of progress has been from a pri- 
vate and narrower philanthropy towards a broader sense of 
social relationships, which realizes that the State should be 
the true nurturing agency; that a country like America, in 
which the ideals of democracy obtain, should, of all countries, 
be the one to provide for every stage of education from baby- 
hood up. We are glad to have it so, and yet a question forms 
itself naturally, and we ask: “What will the kindergarten 
grow into as it becomes more deeply and firmly integrated with 
the public school system?” which, of course, is its logical aim. 
Our feeling in letting go is like that of a mother who cuts off 
her baby’s curls and puts him into trousers, and suffers pangs 
of reluctance all the time she does so. 
Some other questions which we must face are: 1. How can 
we help to keep the mother-element strong and vital in the 
midst of the necessary machinery of the public school? 2. How 
can we induce an increasingly better quality of young woman- 
hood to take up the vocation of kindergarten teaching? 
In our next period of growth everything will depend upon 
the character of the young women who go into new localities 
and there represent the kindergarten. They must be fair and 
strong, and full of the spirit of sacrifice and service. At the 
same time they must possess excellency of scholarship and a 
clear idea of their institutional obligations. They must be 
equal to the situation. They must feel themselves as part of 
a great vibrating force which is steadily impregnating our 
social life. 
Finally, they and we must all learn to be contented and 
patient with the apparently halting progress of our work, and

THE HYGIENE OF THE KINDERGARTEN. 
MISS HELEN WILSON, HOUSTON, TEXAS. 
In the various systems of education among the ancient na- 
tions, the physical well-being of the individual was largely con- 
sidered. Unless the Spartan infant was approved before a body 
of judges as a strong child, he was destroyed; such education 
was chiefly physical, the development of the athlete and war- 
rior was the end in view. Plato commended gymnastics not 
only for development of the body, but for its influence upon 
the soul; Seneca believed gymnastics in moderation was bene- 
ficial, but when employed to form the athlete it exhausted the 
mind and rendered it unfit for study. That system of educa- 
tion, however, which met the needs of ancient heathen nations 
is not applicable to the more enlightened theories of education 
belonging to a civilized Christian nation. 
As early as the time of the Reformation efforts were made in 
Germany to promote the physical well-being of the school popu 
lation. In that country Luther advocated physical exercise to 
develop the different parts of the body and keep it in a health- 
ful condition; Commenius recommended physical training as 
an essential to school instruction; while the Jesuits’ system 
of education embodied valuable principles, not the least of 
which were those of hygiene, embracing not only the physical 
health of the pupil, but hygienic arrangement of the schoot- 
room as to the lighting, heating and ventilation. 
In England, Locke’s doctrine of a “sound mind in a sound 
body” was but an axiomatic truth of the present day, and in 
France, Fenelon described the nature of the child’s mind as 
follows: “The substance of the brain is soft, and it hardens 
every day. The soft condition of the brain makes it easily sus- 
ceptible to impressions, and the surprise of novelty easily ex- 
cites admiration and renders children very inquisitive. It is 
true, also, that this humid and soft state of the brain, joined 
to great warmth, gives it ready and continual motion. Hence 
comes the restlessness of children, who are unable to fix their 
minds upon any subject, or their bodies in any place.” 
A few hundred years after the promulgation of these beliefs,
-P-A-G-E-513
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 513 
Froebel founded the kindergarten, an institution where the 
three-fold nature of the child may be harmoniously developed. 
The present subject has to do with those conditions which will 
preserve and promote a natural, normal development, and fos- 
ter a clean and healthy growth of the physical child. Hygiene 
of the kindergarten differs only from hygiene of any other room 
in the school in the treatment peculiar to the age of the child. 
Each stage in human growth, from infancy to manhood, mani- 
fests characteristics peculiar to it, and demands that its needs 
be heeded. “Physical impressions are, at the beginning of life, 
the only possible medium for awakening the child’s sensibility. 
These impressions should, therefore, be regulated as systemati- 
cally as possible and not left to chance.” 
What is good for the adult is not necessarily good for the 
child; the physical laws that apply to the adult do not apply 
to the child; but the general principles governing the hygiene 
of the home, the school, the theater, the church, or any other 
place where people gather together, is the same. Locality, 
cleanliness, proper ventilation, well-regulated heat and light, 
are subjects of essential importance; therefore let us look first 
at the location of the building, and the room in which the child 
is to receive his first training along educational lines. 
If the kindergarten is a private one, then these matters rest 
largely upon the kindergartner, and she should spare no effort 
to obtain those conditions which tend to make an ideal environ- 
ment for the child; if the kindergarten is mission or settlement, 
it is generally supported by a philanthropic organization, and 
the object for which such an organization exists would imply 
that its kindergarten would embody that which makes for the 
welfare of the child; if the kindergarten is one of the public 
school, then the responsibility lies not only with the director in 
charge, but is shared by the principal of the building, the city 
superintendent, the board of education, and last, but not least, 
the architect who has planned the building. 
Since one of the aims of this department of the S. E. A. is 
to establish the kindergarten in the public school systems of 
the South, suppose we consider more especially the room in the 
school which has been assigned for that purpose. That room 
whose exposure is southeast is the ideal one, but with windows 
on either the east or south side the room can be made comfort-

able and fit the physical needs of its young occupants, for chil- 
dren, like plants, require much sunlight. The dimensions of 
the room should be as large as those of the other class rooms, 
and when possible it should be twice as large. Neither a room 
in the basement or some small room originally intended for an 
office should ever be used for the kindergarten. As to the 
cleanliness of the room, a vacuum cleaner of course is the solu- 
tion, in the more modern schools, to this problem, but in cases 
where provision is not made for such, the sweeping should be 
done with an oiled brush, or a chemically prepared powder or 
wet sawdust should be sprinkled over the floor so as to hold 
the dust as the brush takes it up; dusting should be done with 
an oiled or moist cloth, and not less than once a week the floor 
should be well scrubbed with soap powder and water containing 
some disinfectant. In some kindergartens it has been made 
possible by a small contribution from the mothers of the chil- 
dren to have the floor of the room mopped daily. A floor 
covered with linoleum is sanitary, for there are no cracks in 
which dust may be secreted and it is not difficult to keep clean. 
Dr. Burnham, an authority on hygiene, says: “Three things, 
yea four, are an abomination in any kindergarten, a broom, a 
feather duster, a common drinking cup and a common towel.” 
The matter of ventilation also depends upon the age of the 
building, for nearly all up-to-date public buildings now are 
equipped with a mechanical system of ventilation, but the room 
in the schoo] which has no such provision may be readily ven- 
tilated by opening the windows both at the top and at the 
bottom in order to allow an exit for the bad air and an en- 
trance for the fresh air. The excretions from the lungs and 
skin of teacher and pupils render the air noxious, making it 
as necessary to rid the room of the impure as to admit the 
pure air; in fact, the principal point in ventilation is to pre- 
vent stagnant air. 
The humidity of the room may be attended to by placing a 
vessel of water on the radiator; it is taken for granted that the 
heat is supplied from a central plant, and whether it be steam, 
water or hot air, that the regulation of it is in the hands of a 
competent janitor. That fact which doctors emphasize and 
every teacher should try to follow, of having the light come from 
the left side and back of the pupil, is applicable to the kinder.  
-P-A-G-E-515
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 515 
garten. The pupil should never face the light. Shades which 
roll from the bottom up, and from the top down, are an effective 
agency toward this arrangement. 
Given a cleanly, well ventilated, comfortably heated and 
lighted room in which to spend three hours a day under expert 
supervision, it is natural to suppose that the average child of 
kindergarten age would here expand and develop in accordance 
with his nature, but the most valuable adjunct to this room lies 
beyond the boundary of its four walls. I refer to Nature’s 
school-room, the out-of-doors; whether one calls it the child’s 
garden, playground, school yard or park, it matters not; its 
value from the hygienic standpoint cannot be lessened, nor its 
function as a vital factor in the natural growth of the child be 
denied. The kindergarten is an established part of the system 
of education; the outdoor school has passed beyond the experi- 
mental stage. By uniting the two, the benefits which would 
accrue to the child would be manifold. 
Already, wherever climate, locality of building and yard space 
permit, the kindergartner does much of her work with the 
children outdoors. Flower and vegetable gardens bring the 
child in first-hand contact with nature; he sees for himself 
nature’s processes, and in the use of the garden tools in prepar- 
ing the soil he is using the large muscles whose development at 
this stage of his life is so necessary. 
The equipment of the room is the next consideration. Besides 
a piano and a desk at which the teacher may do her clerical 
work, there should be nothing suggestive of the grown-up. 
“The child has a right to a place of his own, to things of his 
own, to surroundings which have some relation to his size, his 
desires and his capabilities. Things in general are so dispro- 
portionate to the child’s stature, so far from his organs of pre- 
hension, so much above his horizontal line of vision, so much 
ampler than his immediate surroundings, that there is between 
him and all these big things a gap to be filled only by a micro- 
cosm of playthings which give him his just object lessons.” 
The furnishing should be simple, but in good taste; the wall, 
of a color which will be restful to the eye, should have low 
blackboards around it, with which go dustless crayons and 
erasers, and a picture moulding from which pictures may be 
hung on a level with the child’s line of vision. The wainscoting
-P-A-G-E-516
  516 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
should be plain, without carving or fluting, of a color the same 
as that of the wall, perhaps a shade deeper, and of a material 
which can be thoroughly cleaned. It has been decided by the 
best authorities that a chair, the patent of a physician, and 
known as the Mosher chair, is the most hygienic for the child in 
kindergarten. It is constructed along lines which fit the figure 
of the child and aid in his correct sitting posture; it is made 
in three different heights, thereby enabling the youngest and 
the oldest children alike to assume a comfortable position, with 
both feet resting firmly upon the floor. The tables should be 
low and broad, and of a dull finish, rather than highly polished. 
Rugs of some washable material and light in weight, in order 
that they may be readily handled by the children, should be pro- 
vided for them to sit upon, for the young child is apt to catch 
cold upon a floor which is usually draughty and the temperature 
of which is always lower than in the other places in the room. 
The soap supplied should be in liquid form, the towels should be 
the sanitary paper ones, and the plumbing should be the most 
sanitary. 
In most schools now the sanitary drinking fountain is in use, 
but where it has not been introduced too strong a plea cannot be 
made for the individual drinking cup. It may be of paper and 
destroyed after using; or if of less perishable material, it should 
be washed daily and not less often than once a week thoroughly 
scalded. Germs from the mouth and from decayed teeth are 
transmitted by means of the common drinking cup, and much 
contagion among children in the school will be prevented when 
the tin water cooler with the stand in which the cup rests be- 
neath the faucet is abolished. 
The sand and clay with which every kindergarten is provided 
should be disinfected after use, and should be often in use, for 
this large plastic material is well suited to the needs of the 
young child, calling into play the large muscles. All kinder- 
garten material should be selected with reference to the hygiene 
of the muscles and nerves of the child. The large blocks, 
coarse weaving, large crayola and big sheets of drawing paper 
and large needles for sewing, have supplanted to some extent the 
former occupations, which caused eye-strain and produced a 
nervous strain upon the muscles of the hand, due to too early 
development.
-P-A-G-E-517
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 517 
One of the vital factors to be considered in the hygiene of the 
kindergarten is the program. The order of the games, the 
stories, the rhythmic exercises, singing, free play, etc., should 
all be planned with reference to the laws of growth of the child 
and the rhythms of vitality and fatigue. That system of edu- 
cation which fails “to recognize the child’s real condition, or 
conflicts with the fundamental laws of his growth and develop- 
ment, is wrong and harmful.” The child should not be unduly 
stimulated, either through the games or exercises; growth, 
physical growth, is the child’s chief business at this age, and 
formal teaching or exercise should hold no place in the curricu- 
lum. It is not to be implied that his play is to be unruly or 
ungoverned, but rather spontaneously free in action; ‘“move- 
ment on the larger scale, rhythm and activity for the pure joy of 
it. Emphasizing the larger fundamental muscles which make 
for freedom and health,” should be a governing factor in the 
plan of a program; no period of greater duration than fifteen 
or twenty minutes to be employed in sedentary occupations 
which demand close concentration. 
“In children of the kindergarten, primary and intermediate 
grades,” says Dr. Tyler, “the muscular system rather than the 
intellectual is the strategic center of all education. The first 
rule of the kindergarten would, therefore, seem to be: ‘use the 
heavy muscles.’ But the exercise should always be given in 
small doses, often repeated, and between the periods of exercise 
there should be provision for as complete rest as possible.” 
Room, equipment, material, program, leads at last to the 
reason for the existence of the kindergarten—its only asset— 
the child. In what physical condition is the child upon his 
entrance into school? The answer depends upon the district 
of the city from which he comes, the parents whose habits he has 
observed, the environment of the home in which he has been 
growing. The young child is more susceptible to contagion than 
the adult, his body is less protected from infectious diseases. 
It is in the early years of childhood that sense defects originate. 
Just here it is that the individual inspection and examination in 
the school can do its most effective work. Symptoms of dis- 
ease are quickly recognized by the visiting nurse, and infectious 
disease is detected in its early stages. Any eye trouble found 
in the child under seven years of age is more promptly corrected,

and that frequent affection of the small child, adenoids, which 
prevents the full and proper use of his senses, rendering him 
often dull and inactive, can be operated upon with few or no 
deleterious results when discovered in early childhood. Chorea, 
with its evil effects, if taken in time, can be cured, and deafness, 
defects of speech, etc., should be corrected before the child is 
of age for the formal work of the grades. With what power the 
child may resist any attack of sickness depends upon the nour- 
ishment with which his body has been strengthened. Proper 
nourishment, you may say, lies within the province of the home; 
it should, indeed; but the kindergarten, bear in mind, supple- 
ments the home. Too many mothers are indifferent to real 
education, and, like the mother who, when feeding her infant a 
herring, was remonstrated with by one who knew more about 
nourishing children, replied angrily: “Don’t tell me how to 
bring up children. Haven’t I buried ten?” 
When a young child is sent to school to begin the day’s 
routine with a cup of coffee and probably a slice of toast for his 
breakfast, it does, indeed, lie within the province of the school, 
as it stands for the rights of the child, to ascertain the reason, 
why? In one kindergarten where, in an incidental way, the ill 
effects of coffee drinking had been referred to, a mother re- 
marked to the kindergartner: “What have you done to my 
child? He refuses to touch a drop of coffee when I offer it to 
him.” In another instance a child said: “I had a good break- 
fast this morning; I did not drink coffee, though, because I 
knew I was coming to school.” Upon being questioned, she 
explained that she did drink it on holidays. A small beginning, 
but a beginning nevertheless, of a hygienic habit, even though it 
does involve a question of ethics. 
Personal hygiene in the cleanliness of face, hands, nails, 
teeth, can all be impressed upon the kindergarten child, for his 
is the impressionable age, and it is a simple matter to help form 
cleanly habits. The function of the kindergarten is to estab- 
lish right habits, to develop harmoniously the threefold nature 
of the child, but unless a child is a healthy child he cannot be 
well developed mentally, nor can he be a moral child. Restless 
muscles must be worked, and hungry senses fed, if the brain is 
to mature and the heart to attain its full capacity. 
“Tf a child thus lays the foundation for a healthy body and a
-P-A-G-E-519

strong, steady nervous system, and stores his mind with sensory 
impressions, the food for endless thought and wonder; if he 
forms correct habits of action and posture and learns to play’ 
keenly, vigorously and spontaneously, we need not fear for his 
future mental development. As long as a healthy, vigorous 
growth has thus been assured in these most important direc- 
tions, the development continuing along the lines already 
marked and established can hardly fail to be normal and to 
attain the goal of an efficient and powerful manhood.” 
A TEACHER’S VIEWPOINT OF KINDERGARTEN. 
MISS FLORENCE MONTGOMERY, HOUSTON, TEXAS. 
I am glad that my subject reads just as it does, for, while 
I recognize the greater value a consensus of opinion from teach- 
ers in general would have, and while I have reasons to think 
that many first grade teachers think with me—and really can- 
not quite see how they can think otherwise—I can speak with 
authority for only one. So please remember that I am giving 
you only a teacher’s viewpoint of kindergarten, and if you 
should not agree with me, do not visit your disapproval upon 
my sisters’ heads. 
Again, I am glad to have this opportunity to give you my 
viewpoint of kindergarten, for it happens that I have lately had 
an unusual chance to see the effect of kindergarten training 
upon the first-grade work. Two years ago I took charge of a 
first-grade room in one of the Houston schools—a school that 
until that year had not had a kindergarten. I had a room not 
over full of average normal children, children in no way different 
from those I have this year, except that they had not been to 
kindergarten. I had before then taught a good many more 
years than it is necessary to count, but I assure you that never 
before nor since have I ever worked so hard with so little result 
as I did that year. I have never seen a room where it was so 
nearly impossible to get a general response to any stimulus of 
any kind. I might ask anything from “Can you tell me what 
the chalk said?” to “Would you like to play a game?” and all 
but about half a dozen would sit in their seats like little stone 
images and never say a word. Parenthetically I may remark, 
that according to the old school idea of discipline, they were as 
good as gold. But at the close of the third school month two-  
-P-A-G-E-520
520 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
  thirds of that class were just beginning to get a start in their 
first-grade work. 
That was two years ago. This year I have the same room in 
the same school, where we have had a kindergarten for two 
years. I have a room so full that when all are present there 
are not desks enough to go around. At least two-thirds of 
these children have been to kindergarten, and the only trouble 
I had the first week of school with this class was to keep every 
one from trying to tell me everything at the same time. Now 
two-thirds of this class are so well along in their work that the 
only reason they are not making an unusual record is, that I 
cannot give them all they can do without neglecting the other 
third. “There’s my instance.” Facts I have, you see. 
As to the cause—after allowing for the difference that always 
exists between different classes in different years, though that 
must be caused by something; after allowing for greater skill 
in handling this room that my two years’ experience may have 
brought, there is still a great difference that I can only account 
for through the kindergarten. Yet I know how misleading it 
is to draw conclusions from isolated instances of this kind, no 
matter how clear the case may seem, so I have been studying 
the question some. And I have convinced myself that the 
children—please note that I say “the children,” not “the child ;” 
that allows for too much individual difference—but the children 
who come to the first grade from the kindergarten do better 
work, broader work, and more work than children who have not 
had kindergarten training, or a home training that is the 
equivalent of kindergarten life; and that for the great majority 
of children who enter our schools, kindergarten training is 
absolutely essential to satisfactory first-grade work. 
Let me digress here a moment to say that I think there are a 
few children who do not need to go to the kindergarten at all, 
but they come from homes where some one has the knowledge 
and patience and strength and time to give them in their home 
environment the same training the kindergarten teacher gives 
to them who come from homes less fortunate. 
If all mothers could so talk with their ‘children about the 
things they see that their eyes would open to see more and more, 
could so divert their play that each day would find them more 
able to direct themselves, could thus lead them from their native
-P-A-G-E-521
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. bak, 
reactions to some reactions they must acquire, we would not 
need kindergartens. There are homes where this is done, where 
it is even done unconsciously, and I believe it is because there are 
these homes that send us pupils well able to get the best from 
the first-grade work, that we have been so long blind to the need 
for kindergartens in our public schools. 
I taught for many years in a community where the mothers 
had time to talk with their children, to play with them, to read 
to them, and to listen to them, and I was fond of saying I would 
rather teach a room full of healthy, normal seven-year-old 
children who had never seen a school-room than any kinder- 
garten products you could send me. Perhaps under the same 
conditions I would say the same thing again, but now I say unto 
you that, in my opinion, for the very great majority of children 
who enter our schools, kindergarten training is absolutely 
essential to satisfactory first-grade work. 
I told you in the beginning I had reason to believe that there 
are others who think with me. There are, besides ours, three 
other kindergartens in the Houston schools, and there are three 
other first-grade teachers who say there is a vast difference 
between the work done by children who have had kindergarten 
training and those who have not. Let me say right here, lest 
some one think I am making a class distinction in regard to the 
need for kindergartens, that our four kindergartens are located 
in four typically different parts of the city, and, if a plain 
American may speak of such a thing, embrace all classes of 
citizens. The matter of home training does not resolve itself 
into any such simple elements as the distinction between the 
Colonel’s lady and Judy O’Grady. Not at all. 
To get back to my subject. If it is true that children with 
kindergarten training do better first-grade work than children 
without such training, the next question is, “Why?” Iam just 
psychologist enough to believe that unless a fact accords with 
sound psychological principles, either the fact or the principles 
are wrong. Now there are a few psychological principles that 
I am not quite ready to declare wrong, so I must see if my facts 
accord with them. 
Among these principles there is nothing more true than that 
until you touch a child’s experience you get no reaction from 
him, and that until you get some reaction from him all your
-P-A-G-E-522
  522 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
teaching is in vain. Therefore the child with the larger expe- 
rience will learn better and more quickly because he has more 
points of contact for the new knowledge—a broader basis for his 
association of ideas, or, as we sometimes say, he has a better 
background for the things we wish him to learn. 
There was nothing the matter with the stolid room I had two 
years ago but a lack of this experience. They had led such 
narrow, inexpressive lives that there were very, very few points 
where I could touch their experience. If these same children 
had been to kindergarten they would have had a rich fund of 
experience gained through their morning talks, their stories, 
their games, and a habit of expression that would, no doubt, 
have made them noisy, but would also no doubt have made 
them more responsive to my appeals. 
Again, there is nothing more true than that an impression is 
fixed only through motor activity. This is the reason kinder- 
garten seeing is of more value than much untrained seeing may 
be. What the kindergarten child sees and hears and feels, he 
expresses through some physical activity until it becomes a part 
of him. 
Also this third thing is true. An acquired reaction may be 
acquired only by being joined to a native reaction. This is the 
reason the kindergarten is apparently all play. A child’s native 
reactions lie chiefly in the field of play, and it is through touch- 
ing them that we may most quickly lead him to acquire another 
kind. 
What has all this to do with kindergarten? Just this: it 
is, in my opinion, sound psychology to make the kindergarten a 
bridge from the home to the school—a bridge of experience built 
from the instinct to play to the power to see and do. For the 
building of backgrounds, important as it is, is not all the kinder- 
gartens do. It also trains children to see. And they must 
see to do the work we require—see so unerringly that the differ- 
ence between an “a” and an “o,” an “m” and an “n,” is as wide 
as the sea. How else can they gather from the countless little 
black symbols on the printed page the thought and feeling that 
they represent. 
It isn’t pure perversity that makes Johnnie call “baby” 
“book,” and “kitty” “kite;” it is because he does not see. 
Perhaps if Johnnie had played with spheres and cubes and
-P-A-G-E-523
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 523 
squares, distinguishing between their forms; had made de- 
signs with bits of colored paper like designs he was shown, he 
would have developed a power of discrimination that would 
have helped him see word forms. So much for the mechanics 
of reading, the part of primary work apparently the least re- 
lated to kindergarten. 
In language work which, taken as self-expression, is so 
closely related to reading, it is again a question of experiences, 
and not even the opponents thereof deny the fact that the 
kindergarten children talk well. If we consider number work 
we will find that the kindergarten pupil who has built a fence 
of his blocks and told you that it is two inches high, one inch 
wide and four inches long; and has changed it perhaps to a 
post four inches high, two inches broad and one inch thick, 
has unconsciously developed a sense of number that few un- 
trained children have. 
If we wish to extend the discussion to cover hand work, 
drawing and music, I hardly think the question debatable. 
No one denies that kindergarten children use their hands 
better than untrained children do. Apropos of which I should 
like to say, wiser heads than mine hold that to some extent 
mental development comes through motor control. And once 
upon a time not so long ago I heard a first-grade room sing 
beautifully their first months of school. When I expressed 
my surprise, their teacher said: “Oh, they are kindergarten 
children,” as if, of course, that explained it all. If all these 
things be true, why are we arguing the question? Why does 
not every one agree that kindergarten training is essential to 
satisfactory first-grade work? One reason I have given you, 
the first, that there are some fortunate children who do so 
well without it. Another is, I am sorry to say, that not all 
kindergartens nor all primary schools are perfect yet. 
As long as there are kindergarten teachers who send out 
children unwilling to do anything but talk and play—I must 
confess I do not know any such just now, but I am afraid there 
are still a few somewhere—as long as there are first-grade 
teachers who will not budge from their rigid ideas to meet the 
kindergarten child half-way on his road to school discipline, 
there will be complaints against the kindergarten from the 
first grade. Just how much I think their complaints are worth 
 
-P-A-G-E-524
  524 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
I am afraid to say. They always remind me of a sentence 
Mr. V. O’Shea, of Wisconsin, wrote in 1905: “Kindergarten 
children must suffer hard knocks in the elementary school 
before they learn to restrain their spontaneous activities and 
apply themselves to hard tasks.” And I wonder whether the 
kindergarten teacher or the first-grade teacher has the more to 
learn along that line. 
A more important criticism is that the kindergarten is too 
often a sort of appendage to the public school, working only 
for its own ends and not closely related to the next grade. Of 
course, wherever this is true, the kindergarten does not reach 
its full measure of efficiency. There are other criticisms 
against the kindergarten. One comes from the mother, who 
does not understand that what seems to her useless play is the 
best preparation her child can have for the book knowledge 
she is so anxious for him to gain. Another comes from those 
superintendents who maintain that the kindergarten is not 
an essential part of the public school. Just how they main- 
tain their position, I confess I do not know, for again I say 
unto you it is my opinion that for the great majority of pupils 
who enter our public schools, kindergarten training is abso- 
lutely essential to satisfactory first-grade work.

PROVISIONS IN THE VARIOUS SOUTHERN STATES 
FOR TEACHING AGRICULTURE. 
HON. ED, R. KONE, AUSTIN, TEXAS, 
A gentleman who wrote a paper on a subject asked a friend 
to give him his opinion of it, and the friend said: “It is 
neither interesting nor of much value, for the reason that you 
have made the mistake of trying to tell everything and not to 
leave anything for anybody else to say.” I am not likely to 
fall into the same error in discussing on this occasion the sub- 
ject assigned me, “Provisions in the Various Southern States 
for Teaching Agriculture,” because, first, even if I knew what 
they were, I could not state all of them in the twenty minutes 
allotted to me; and, second, letters of inquiry that I wrote 
brought responses only from Alabama, Virginia, Georgia, 
Louisiana, Florida, South Carolina and Kentucky, and such 
facts as I may present regarding other States had to be gleaned 
from Bulletin No. 263 of the United States Bureau of Educa- 
tion, entitled “State School Systems,” covering legislation

from 1904 to 1909, both inclusive, and from numerous other 
sources. 
There are not at Austin, nor anywhere else in Texas, so far 
as I am aware, complete sets of the statutes of the various 
States, though there are of the decisions of the courts of last 
resort. Had there been, I could have presented you a more 
valuable paper. I hope I may submit some data and observa- 
tions that may induce exchange of information and profitable 
discussion by the members of this body. College instruction 
in agriculture is given in the following institutions receiving

OTHER FACTS. 
Alabama.—Alabama has one agricultural school in each of 
the nine congressional districts of the State. They are gov- 
erned in accordance with the provisions of Sections 59 and 60 
of the Code of 1907 as amended April 22, 1911. It is provided 
by law that elementary agriculture shall be taught in all of 
the public schools of the State. 
Arkansas.—Acts of March 31, 1909, and March 31, 1910, re- 
quire the elementary principles of agriculture and horticul- 
ture to be taught in the public schools. Act of April 1, 1909, 
divided the State into four districts, in each of which should 
be located an agricultural high school, and the Legislature, at 
the same session, appropriated $160,000 for establishing the 
schools. Compulsory school attendance is provided for by 
~ Act of 1909. 
Florida.—Acts of 1909 provide for teaching agriculture and 
civil government in the common schools, and that all teachers 
must stand satisfactory examinations in those subjects. 
Georgia—Under Act of August 18, 1906, there have been 
established and are in successful operation one agricultural 
and mechanical school in each of the eleven congressional dis- 
tricts. They are branches of the State College of Agriculture; 
have elegant, commodious and well-equipped buildings, and
-P-A-G-E-528
  528 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
have attached to them farms consisting of from 25 to 125 acres. 
It is also provided by law that the elementary principles of 
agriculture shall be taught in the common schools. 
Kentucky.—There are no provisions for teaching agricul- 
ture except at the College of Agriculture at Lexington. 
Louisiana.—Hon. T. H. Harris, Superintendent of the State 
Department of Education, writing to me, says: “A text-book 
on the subject of agriculture (elementary) is required to be 
taught in the seventh grade of all the public schools of the 
State. The General Assembly of 1908 appropriated $25,000 a 
year to be distributed among the agricultural schools through- 
out the State. This money goes to twenty such schools. 
Some of the regulations governing agricultural schools are (a) 
the employment of a teacher who shall give his entire time to 
the subject of agriculture. He must be a graduate of an agri- 
cultural college. (b) Each school must have a demonstration 
farm of as much as ten acres. (c) Each school must own a 
horse, wagon, farm implements, tools, etc. (d) The staple 
crops of the community must be raised on the demonstration 
farm. (f) The work as far as possible must be done by the 
students and the teacher of agriculture. (g) Beginning with 
next session, it is proposed to have the agricultural schools 
run all the year, and to keep on the school farm at least one 
registered boar and one registered bull for use in the com- 
munity. These twenty-five agricultural departments are placed 
in large country schools and are not separate institutions, such 
as are organized in Georgia, Mississippi, and some of the other 
States. In other words, we are proceeding upon the Daven- 
port theory that the best results are obtained when the indus- 
trial subjects are taught in connection with other branches. 
We are having thousands of boys and girls instructed in their 
homes and on their farms in such things as corn raising, hog 
raising, canning vegetables, etc. This work is under the im- 
mediate direction of the Extension Department of the Louisi- 
ana State University. Several men and women are employed 
to look after it. The results have been very highly satisfac- 
tory.” 
Maryland.—Maryland has established a rural high school 
for whites, in which agriculture is taught, and an industrial 
school for negroes.
-P-A-G-E-529
  JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGS. 529 
Mississippi—Act of March 21, 1908, authorizes the estab- 
lishment of an agricultural school in each county. Last year 
(1910) the Legislature added another, making two such schools 
in each of the seventy-five counties. 
Oklahoma.—Art. 13, Sec. 7, State Constitution: “The Leg- 
islature shall provide for the teaching of the elements of agri- 
culture, horticulture, stock feeding and domestic science in 
the common schools of the State.” This requirement has been 
given effect under an Act of the Legislature, approved May 
2, 1908, and subsequent legislation. It is provided that no 
one shall be granted a certificate to teach in the public schools 
who has not passed a satisfactory examination in the elemen- 
tary branches of agriculture. The State Commissioners of 
Agricultural and Industrial Education are charged with the 
duty of prescribing courses of study. The Act of 1908 is very 
broad and thorough. 
South Carolina.—No provision for teaching agriculture in 
elementary or high schools. 
Tennessee.—Elementary agriculture is required to be taught 
in the State normal schools, to prepare teachers for giving in- 
struction in that subject in the common schools. There is one 
agricultural and industrial school for negroes. 
Texas.—A course in agriculture is part of the regular cur- ° 
riculum of the University of Texas, of the Agricultural and 
Mechanical College, of Prairie View State Normal and Indus- 
trial College, of the College of Industrial Arts, and of the four 
State normal schools. It is also part of the course of study 
in the summer normal school of the University of Texas. The 
Agricultural and Mechanical College conducts a summer school 
for adult farmers. The law provides that the elementary prin- 
ciples of agriculture shall be taught in the common free schools. 
The Texas Farmers’ Congress at its meeting in July, 1910, de- 
clared for the following things: 
1. Teaching of agriculture in the public schools, and exam- 
ination of applicants for teachers’ certificates in this subject. 
2. Encouragement of the introduction of industrial education 
in the public schools. 
3. Enactment of laws improving the efficiency of elemen- 
tary public schools, and establishing rural high schools. 
Responding to these demands, enactments of the Thirty-

second Legislature make satisfactory examination in the sub- 
ject of agriculture a requirement for the issuance of teachers’ 
certificates in this State; provide for the establishment of 
rural high schools and the introduction of industrial educa- 
tion in the high schools and a more efficient organization of 
the elementary public schools in the rural districts. In addi- 
tion to instruction given by the schools, the Texas Department 
of Agriculture, through bulletins, farmers’ institutes organized 
by it, aid and instruction given in combatting insect pests 
and fungus diseases, answering letters of iquiry from persons 
engaged in the several branches of agriculture and in other 
ways; and the ten experiment stations by their labors are filling 
important roles in the work of agricultural education in the 
State—a condition which, I presume, prevails to more of less 
extent in other Southern States. As our State Superintendent 
of Public Instruction is here and can give to those interested 
any other information they may desire regarding provisions 
for agricultural education in Texas, I shall not go into fur- 
ther details regarding them. 
Virginia.—The Legislature in 1908 appropriated $20,000 for 
the establishment of departments of agriculture, domestic 
economy and manual training in at least one high school in 
each congressional district, and provided that not less than 
five acres of land shall be acquired for each of the schools 
for practical demonstrations of agricultural science, and that 
such agricultural high schools may be used as centers for 
directing demonstration and extension farm work, under rules 
and regulations prescribed by the State Board of Education 
and the President of the Virginia College of Agriculture and 
Polytechnic Institute. It is provided, also, that elementary 
agriculture may be taught in the common free schools. An 
act passed in 1910 authorizes boards of supervisors to appro- 
priate money for the establishment of agricultural schools in 
the several counties. Compulsory school attendance may be 
roquired in any county, city, town or magisterial district by 
majority vote of the people in favor thereof. Pensions are 
provided for teachers after thirty years of service. 
West Virginia—An act passed in 1909 adds agriculture to 
the list of subjects in which teachers are to be examined, so 
_that they can teach it in the public schools. While it is only

within our own time that the truth has begun to be generally 
recognized and practically enforced that education should em- 
brace not only grammar, mathematics, history, philosophy, 
belle lettres and the classics, but vocational training, includ- 
ing the science and practice of the art of agriculture, as its 
branch of greatest importance—that there can be no real 
independence for the individual and no solid assurance of 
the continuance of free institutions unless, as nearly as pos- 
sible, every citizen capable of turning it to account is taught 
to be a bread winner and to do useful labor of hand or brain— 
still, at an early day, there were great men who were cog- 
nizant of the fact and gave expression to it in words that lit 
the way for the more auspicious conditions that now prevail. 
The Philadelphia Society for the Promotion of Agriculture, 
of which George Washington was an honorary member, ap- 
pointed a committee January 21, 1794, that made a report 
suggesting, among other plans for agricultural education, the 
use of the common school system of the State to educate the 
farmer in his business, “The county schoolmasters being made 
the secretaries of the county societies, and the school houses 
the places of meeting and the repositories of their transac- 
tions, models, etc.” “The Legislature,” said the committee, 
“may enjoin on these schoolmasters the combination of the 
subject of agriculture with other parts of education.” 
In his first annual message, January 8, 1790, President 
Washington recommended the advancement of agriculture by 
a national university and other means, and said, in that con- 
nection: “It will not be doubted that with reference to either 
individual or national welfare agriculture is of primary im- 
portance. In proportion as nations advance in population and 
other circumstances of maturity, this truth becomes more 
apparent, and renders the cultivation of the soil more and 
more an object of public patronage. Institutions for pro- 
moting it grow up, supported by the public purse, and to what 
object can it be dedicated with greater propriety?” 
Our own Mirabeau B. Lamar, hero of San Jacinto and Presi- 
dent of the Republic of Texas, said: “Cultivated mind is the 
guardian genius of democracy. . . . It is the only dictator 
that freemen acknowledge and the only security that freemen 
desire. The University of Texas has made this declaration its

motto, and has rightly interpreted it to mean mental culture 
that will fit him or her who receives it to do well some part 
of the world’s work that needs to be done, and, by performing 
it, secure a degree of financial reward, social standing and 
personal satisfaction that will make life worth living. Sparta’s’ 
greatness was due to her citizens being educated for war. 
The greatness of Athens and the fact that her art, literature 
and learning, when dug from the tomb of the middle ages, 
called into being modern civilization, were owing to the courses 
of instruction given to her citizens in her schools. The people 
of every nation, from the dawn of history to the present hour, 
who have performed a notable part on the earth, received 
special education that enabled them to do what they did. No 
man can cast the horoscope of the future of the United States, 
nor of Texas. 
This much we are justified in believing, namely: It is to 
be glorious beyond the brightest visions of fancy and it to be 
built on the firm foundation of agricultural development. 
Therefore, while education along many lines is needed, that 
in agricultural science and art is of transcendently paramount 
importance. I rejoice that such progress is being made in it 
in Texas and the entire South, and that that progress will 
continue, for it means that the hopes of every patriot who has 
labored for the building up, long life and glory of the greatest 
of all republics will be fully realized in the years that are to 
come. 
WHAT CONSTITUTES SUCCESSFUL WORK IN AGRI- 
CULTURE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL. 
L. N. DUNCAN, AUBURN, ALA. 
I think that we might well ask the question, what consti- 
tutes successful teaching in the high school in any subject? 
Judging the teacher from the ordinary standpoint, I think 
that we might make up our estimate as to the successful work 
of a teacher from the following basis: 
1. A successful teacher should impart facts to the pupils 
or be able to make them acquainted with the important truths 
and principles of the subject in question. For example, a suc- 
cessful teacher of history should be one who has the power 
of holding the attention of the pupils and making them famil-
-P-A-G-E-533
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 533 
iar with the important facts and incidents of history. In like 
manner, the successful teacher of mathematics, grammar, 
geography and all other subjects of the course is the teacher 
who makes the pupils acquainted with the facts and principles 
involved in the subject and causes them to retain these facts. 
2. The successful teacher should also do more than merely 
teach the facts and principles of the subject. He should teach 
the spirit of it. I mean by this that the successful teacher 
will so interest the pupils in the subject, whatever it may be, 
as to cause them to desire further knowledge and make them 
love the subject. The successful teachers that I remember in 
. my experience as a pupil were those who did not stop with the 
bare facts in the text, but gave these facts new life and caused 
me to desire to know the origin and cause of them and their 
influence upon future facts and principles. They gave me a 
desire for research. 
Estimating the work, then, of the teacher in agriculture 
from these two standpoints, we would say that a successful 
teacher of agriculture is one who makes the pupils familiar 
with the principles of soil formation, soil preparation, seed 
selection, soil fertility, cultivation, plant propagation, animal 
feeding, as well as a large number of other important facts 
and principles pertaining to the subject. If the proper spirit 
of research and investigation is developed in the pupils by the 
teacher, they will also have a desire to read further, to inves- 
tigate, to look up the literature on the subject, to get the latest 
pamphlets, circulars and publications bearing on it. 
Since agriculture is a very practical subject, I think that 
we may add another point to be considered in estimating the 
successful work of a teacher and that is the practical side. 
In other words, is the teacher successful in having the teach- 
ings of the school room carried into practice in the homes 
and on the farms where the pupils come from? Therefore, in 
making a careful and full estimate of the work of a successful 
teacher in agriculture we would have to consider the following 
points: 1. Does the teacher cause the pupils to learn the 
facts? 2. Does the teacher teach the spirit of the subject, or 
cause the pupils to seek further knowledge along the line of 
agriculture? 3. Is the work of the teacher practical? That 
is, to what extent does the teaching of agriculture in the 
school room affect the work on the farms and in the homes? 
 
-P-A-G-E-534
    534 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
HOW THE WORK MAY BEST BE DONE, 
The present tendency in every subject in the school room is 
toward the laboratory or experimental method. There is no 
subject of the school course which so readily lends itself to the 
laboratory method as agriculture. The resourceful teacher 
can find on every hand an abundance of material to use in 
illustrating almost every principle which is attempted to be 
taught in this subject. On the way to and from school the 
teacher may find buds and shoots to illustrate budding and 
grafting; crumbling rocks to illustrate soil formation; gulleys 
and washings to illustrate soil erosion; plants growing, flowers 
blooming, processes of soil preparation and cultivation on the 
farms along the roadside. With a little forethought every 
teacher may have a few bottles, cans and other simple appara- 
tus, which costs practically nothing, to illustrate a large num- 
ber of these principles. Every effort should be made on the 
part of the teacher to make the work practical by illustrations 
from the materials surrounding the pupils. The teacher 
should also make an effort to get the pupils to repeat the 
experiments at their homes to see if they are correct and then 
to further carry them out on a plot of ground to see what the 
results may be in a practical way. 
For example, the teacher may illustrate how the soil holds 
moisture, the importance of deep plowing and frequent culti- 
vation with the use of a few bottles and two or three different 
kinds of soil. The teacher then should try to get each pupil 
in the agricultural class to repeat this experiment at his home 
with apparatus devised by himself. Then in order to make 
this of further importance and practical value to the pupil 
the teacher should try to get each one to grow a prize acre 
of corn, carrying out the idea of deep preparation and frequent 
shallow cultivation. The boys should work with corn and the 
girls with tomatoes. The most effective way of carrying out 
this work is to organize the boys into a corn club and the girls 
into a tomato club. This line of work not only fixes the prin- 
ciples in the minds of the pupils , but also interests the parents 
of the children in the work of the school. Too much impor- 
tance cannot be attached to this matter. 
A great deal is said now-a-days about the school as the 
social center of the community in which it is located. There
-P-A-G-E-535
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 585 
is no part of the school work which can be so readily con- 
nected with the home and through which the school may be 
made the social center than that of agriculture. The Boys’ 
Corn Club should have frequent meetings at the school house 
so that the members may make reports on the progress of their 
work, compare notes with the other boys and receive further 
instruction from their teacher. In like manner the Girls’ 
Tomato Club should have frequent meetings to make reports 
on the work and to receive instructions from the teacher for 
further progress. At all of these meetings the parents of the 
boys and girls should be present to hear the reports and to 
lend their counsel and advice. At such meetings as these all- 
important questions pertaining to better farming, better living 
in the homes on the farms and general progress along all lines 
should be discussed. In this work the teacher should be the 
leader and moving spirit and in order for it to be a success 
the teacher must be enthusiastic, must know the work, must 
be interested in it and must believe in farming. An atmos- 
phere for these things must be created and this depends largely 
upon the teacher. ‘ 
A school doing this character of work will soon have new 
life and will be looked upon by the patrons as the leading 
factor and the main interest in the community. It will be- 
come in fact the social center. Everybody will look to the 
school as the source of inspiration and information for better 
farming and better living in the homes on the farms. 
I know of a number of schools, some of them one-room 
schools, in Alabama that are doing just this kind of work, and 
doing it effectively and successfully. I will speak of one as 
an example. A Spring Hill, Pike County, Troy, Route No. 2, 
is a rural high school, which in many respects is a model. The 
teacher, Miss Delphine Feminear, graduated from the Troy 
State Normal School a few years ago with distinction. This 
school is located twelve miles from Troy in the country, in 
the midst of an agricultural section and every one of its 
patrons is a farmer. 
Miss Feminear is a successful teacher of all the ordinary 
branches of the school course, but she desired to do more than 
to merely teach the subjects of the course. She wished to lend 
a hand in helping to build up the agricultural interests of the
-P-A-G-E-536
  586 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
people patronizing her school. She organized a boys’ corn 
club with several members, a girls’ tomato club and also a 
sewing and cooking club for the girls. Local prizes were 
offered for the boys and girls getting the best results with their 
work. 
Frequent public meetings of these various clubs were held 
for the purpose of discussing such questions as the importance 
of better home sanitation, better health, better farming, better 
cooking, better sewing and other like questions. Experts along 
special lines were invited to these meetings whenever possible. 
If they could not be had, the minister, the physician and other 
local talent were used. These meetings were always enthusias- 
tic and successful. 
During the canning season canning demonstrations or can- 
ning picnics were held and the girls were shown how to put 
up their tomatoes and other vegetables in the best method. 
The older people were always present and lent their assistance 
in carrying on the work and learned how to do these things in 
a better way. A basket dinner was served and everybody had 
a jolly good time. Instead of discussing the faults and short- 
comings of their neighbors, the questions uppermost in their 
minds were how to put up vegetables, how to preserve tomatoes, 
how to farm better, which boy had the best acre of corn, and 
plans were discussed for doing better next year. 
One of Miss Feminear’s pupils, Cuthbert Wentworth, made 
127.14 bushels of corn on his prize acre at a cost of 32 cents 
per bushel. This was made on land that had been making 
from 15 to 20 bushels per acre. One of her girls, Lola Nelson, 
made 1,023 cans of tomatoes on one-tenth of an acre, besides 
a lot of preserves and other byproducts for home use. As 
this work progressed the school building was improved, pic- 
tures were hung on the walls and books were bought for the 
library. 
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION NOT A SEPARATE AND DIS- 
TINCT EDUCATION, BUT A NECESSARY ELE- 
MENT OF EDUCATION. 
H. L. WHITFIELD, COLUMBUS, MISS. 
Before taking up this particular phase of education, I deem 
it necessary to discuss briefly general educational conditions

and the relation which industrial studies sustain to the gen- 
eral scheme of education. It is through a continuous adjust- 
ment to ever-changing life conditions that progress in civiliza- 
tion is made possible. To this general principle education as 
a force for civilization is no exception; it should never be a 
static institution of society. 
Educational progress has always been characterized by a 
constant struggle between those who believe that the present 
order should exist forever without change, and those who be- 
lieve that the educational institution should be constantly 
changed to meet the ever-changing life conditions. We are 
now in the midst of one of those contests that has ever marked 
the evolution of education since man first began to speculate 
on educational ends and to plan educational processes. 
The mental stimulus caused by scientific discovery, inven- 
tion, industrial achievement and new methods of thought of 
the nineteenth century, has caused man to investigate every- 
thing; no institution or process, it matters not how old and 
how venerated, has escaped being made the object of scientific 
inquiry. Educational systems have enjoyed no immunity dur- 
ing this period of investigation, but as has been true of every 
other form of institutional life, processes in all the parts of 
work, modes of thought and systems of philosophy, the ques- 
tion mark has been placed after every end and process. Learned 
men have taken as their life tasks the study of the history, 
philosophy and procedure of the various school systems. The 
results of their experiments and investigations have caused 
the people generally to study their schools from all stand- 
points as has never been done in the history of organized edu- 
cation. 
Although this work has only just begun, yet some deductions 
have been made to which the common sense and experience 
of mankind give a most hearty assent. To some extent the 
path has been blazed for us, and we can now begin the work 
of reorganizing and redirecting our education in accordance , 
with these verities which have been discovered and tested. 
Let us now briefly discuss some of these general deductions. 
First. It has been proven, we believe, that as the various 
schools in our system of public education have been organized 
and conducted, they have not given us the results that they 
   
-P-A-G-E-540
  588 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
should have done; and that those results which we have ob- 
tained have been at too great an expenditure of money and 
effort. As with all other kinds of work, before we can in- 
telligently pass judgment on the work of the schools, we must 
have a standard of measurement. We have always been told 
that schooling was a preparation for living; I know of no 
better test of the efficiency of schools than what they do for 
life in all its phases. Have the schools of the past had that 
influence for better living that we have a right to expect for 
so vast an expenditure of money and of human effort? How 
about health, both personal and general? Are our boys and 
girls getting in the public schools that physical instruction 
and training that will mean well-developed bodies and robust 
health through life? We know that most of those diseases 
that annually call for the heaviest tolls on humanity are pre- 
ventable diseases. Are we preventing them? We have had 
public schools in the South for a half century. What have 
they done for this great basis of human efficiency in all lines 
of human endeavor? 
What effect has our common school had on home life—the 
fundamental institution of society? What efforts have they 
directly towards relieving life of some of that ceaseless, grind- 
ing drudgery, which too often characterizes the work of the 
home? Have our homes been made comfortable, convenient 
and beautiful? Have we had the proper regard for art, litera- 
ture and all those other refining influences that make for the 
cultivation of the esthetic natures of the children? Yet these 
homes have been built and are being maintained by the 
products of the common schools. 
Have our schools given proper training for the duties 7 
citizenship? What about our civic condition? Is it as i 
could and should be? Practically all of our citizens of today 
have been trained in the public schools. Do the highest ideals 
prevail? Are our civic problems solved in a scientific way? 
Are the ordinary functions of citizenship discharged as they 
should be? Do men as a rule vote from right motives, render 
honest and intelligent jury service and discharge the duties . 
official life as they should be discharged? In answer to thes 
questions, I can but refer you to the various political contests 
that have taken place in the different States of the South in 
recent years.

What have our schools done for industry? The mere asking 
of the question will bring to the minds of all present the 
absolute neglect of this most important phase of life by our 
schools. I am glad to say, however, that there is going up 
from every section of the South, as well as from the country at 
large, a demand that the children be given such education 
in the industrial branches as will equip them to do efficiently 
the work of life. 
Second. Why have our schools failed to make for better 
life as they should have done? Here, in the opinion of the 
writer, is where our educational philosophers have done for 
us their greatest service. They have shown us_ beyond 
cayvil that the very conception we have had of education has 
been wrong. That the fundamental philosophy upon which the 
whole superstructure of education rests is false. That the 
idea which has dominated education for centures, that the 
exercise of the intellect on certain forms of subject-matter 
would give the individual that power which would enable him 
to meet well all the problems of his existence, is not only a 
psychological absurdity, but contrary to the common sense and 
experience of mankind. They deny that a few time-honored 
subjects have the inherent power of giving general discipline 
to the mind. They assert that any well-organized, nutritious 
subject-matter, properly taught and learned, will give an in- 
creased power to take in and assimilate subject-matter of like 
kind, but not of all kinds; they further show that this mental 
development partakes of the very nature of the subject-matter 
which has been the cause of the development. Subjects can- 
not be studied for their disciplinary value and then dismissed 
from the mind; whatever is studied well not only gives us 
power of a limited kind, but makes for habit, character and 
destiny. 
The writer believes that the general acceptance of the dogma 
of formal discipline has been the one cause of the failure of 
our schools to make life better at all points as they should 
have done, and that no correct start in public education can be 
made until the entire educational machinery be overhauled in 
the light of modern research and investigation. 
Third. That our school forces and resources should be so 
reorganized and redirected that there should be a logical and
-P-A-G-E-542
  540 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
conscious relation between what is taught and some essential 
phase of life. In other words, that education should be an 
adjustment to life, and not merely the teaching of isolated and 
unrelated subject-matter, with the idea that in some uncon- 
scious and inexplicable way that it would bring about the 
adjustment of the individual to his existence, but that there 
should be no definite educational ends, and that all school 
processes should be well worked out and directed for the ac- 
complishment of some or all these ends. 
The destiny of man is best achieved when, through educa- 
tion, he is brought into harmonious relations with the institu- 
tions of his civilization. This comprehends two general steps 
in the educational process; first, individual development; a: 
second, the adjustment of the developed individual to th 
ends. These processes are not separate and distinct, but are 
harmoniously carried on in the same individual at the same 
time. 
In our Christian civilization, what are these ends? To the 
writer, everything in life can be comprehended within the 
following great objects of education: Physical well-being, 
homemaking, citizenship, religion and industry. These to- 
gether constitute the perfect educational chain. All are of 
equal importance, and no one of them can be left out without 
detriment to the whole. All are interrelated and interde- 
pendent, therefore each can be best accomplished when it ts 
considered in its relation to the others. 
In the opinion of the writer, the one pressing problem for 
the educators today is the working out of the school so ol   the school will actually do what we claim education should 
do for the individual and the State. In doing this work, the 
first thing to do, and the most important thing to do, is for 
us to divest ourselves of those ideas of education which have 
been handed down the line of the changing generations for 
centuries. Let us remember that we came into possession of 
these ideas by mere authority; we accepted them as eternal 
verities simply because they had the stamp of tradition upon 
them; they were never placed before us as the logical con- 
clusions of rational examination. The writer has no doubt 
that at the time each of these subjects was adopted into the 
sacred curriculum there was an excellent reason for it; but
-P-A-G-E-543
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. BAL 
he also believes that much of the subject-matter of the time- 
honored curriculum survived long after the reason for its be- 
ing in the curriculum ceased to exist. 
We have been taught to regard this curriculum as a sacred 
inheritance; that to question it at any point is vile profanation 
—a gross disrespect to remote ancestors and proof of our own 
intellectual inferiority. Then again, we are largely the prod- 
ucts of this system, and no one likes to know or admit that 
he is not everything that it is possible for him to be; and if 
he advocates a new theory of education, it is equivalent to 
admitting that his own education has been of an inferior 
nature. Before we can take up the problem in a rational 
way we must divest ourselves of a considerable degree of pride. 
Another thing that makes the problem one of peculiar dif- 
ficulty is, much of the new matter which we believe is of vital 
importance has not yet been properly organized and tested. 
The old subjects, through years of study, have been sys- 
tematically arranged and are easily teachable. Yet this fact 
only puts additional responsibility on the educational leaders, 
for the lack of well-arranged material in no way diminishes 
the importance of the new subjects, but rather emphasizes the 
necessity of getting at work as soon as possible. 
This paper is limited to a discussion of those subjects which 
are commonly denominated industrial subjects. Personally, 
I regret that the phrase “industrial education” was ever 
coined, for it has often been brought to my attention that the 
use of this term has carried to many people the idea that there 
are two kinds of education—the old time, regular one, much 
to be preferred; the other, a new kind, known as industrial 
education. Those who believe in the old order would concede 
that industrial education is a good thing for those who are 
not mentally capable of taking the regular kind of education; 
but he who would emphasize too much the importance of these 
subjects in his education, must forever reconcile himself to a 
life devoid of all possibility for culture; while, on the other 
hand, the enthusiastic advocates of these new subjects, in their 
impatience to see the wrong done by education to the great 
number of people who pursue industrial lives, corrected as 
quickly as possible, would welcome separate and distinct 
schools, where they would have more time to give to this kind 
of instruction.
-P-A-G-E-544
  542 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Both of these positions are wrong. We must come to know 
that industry should be studied, because no general education 
can be complete which does not comprehend a study of indus- 
try; that the practical benefits are not to be disregarded; that 
the intelligent study of industry is one of the essential bases 
for abstract thinking; that through the right kind of the study 
of industry, the individual gets those elements of concrete 
kuowledge which are essential to the intelligent interpreta- 
tations of literature and the fine arts, hence these subjects 
have a cultural value which cannot be neglected in the plan- 
ning of a liberal education; and last, that this important 
feature of education cannot be neglected without a material 
hurt to all the great general ends of education. 
None of these ends belong to any particular grade of school; 
to some extent and in that manner best suited to the age and 
development of the pupil, they should be taught from the first 
school year of the child to the end of his high school career. 
Hach of these ends of education has its body of subject-matter ; 
the text-books are to be used, not as unrelated subject-matter 
to be pursued as ends in themselves, but as logical means to 
the accomplishment of the great life needs. 
Let the discussion now be directed to the kinds of industrial 
instruction that should be given in our various classes of 
school—common school, high school and college. When we 
take up this question as related to the work of the common 
schools, we are told that the doors of the course of study are 
closed; that the common schools have had to recognize so 
much subject-matter at various times in the past that the 
curriculum is now over-loaded to the extent that there is not 
now time to do well what the schools are attempting to do. 
As one sees the child on his way to school, loaded to his full 
physical capacity with school books, he is almost persuaded 
that the argument is final—that it is impossible to impose 
other subjects on the already overloaded curriculum. But 
let us not reach a conclusion on the prima facie evidence of 
the case. Possibly in the present course of study we can find 
some things that have outlived their days of usefulness; there 
may be subjects that either in part or in whole may have never 
had a rightful place in the curriculum; others may have been 
added when there was a real reason for their being a part of
-P-A-G-E-545
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 543, 
the subject-matter which each child should learn; but under 
the changed conditions of life these are no longer vital in the 
proper adjustment of the child to his great life-ends. Or per- 
haps, by careful examination, we may find that the very man- 
ner in which the necessary subjects have been taught has 
caused them to consume too much of the time and effort of 
the child. Is it not a fact that it has been generally true in 
the common schools that the various subjects of the curricula 
have been ends in themselves, and that they have been taught 
without a proper regard to their relation to each other or to 
their correlation with the life of the community? I am sure 
that an intelligent and careful study of our common schools 
will reveal to us many ways of conserving time and energy, of 
robbing the work of much of the drudgery that has always 
characterized it, and of making it appeal to the interests of 
the child in a way that will enable it to accomplish a greater 
amount of school work in a shorter time. 
But I am sure that all will agree with me, even if they 
desire otherwise, that there can be only one common school 
course, and it is out of the question to even think of a system 
of separate industrial schools. The latter proposition is so 
manifestly self-evident that time will not be taken to discuss 
it. As to the first proposition, it suffices to say that the 
revenues for common schools are not sufficient to offer more 
than one course, if the people should desire the schools to 
do so. The logic of the situation does not require but the one 
course. The first part of the child’s education should consist 
in his learning well the little concrete world in which he has 
his being. At this early age the effort should be to have the 
child gain universal knowledge. It is at this age that the 
Maker has devised that the child must get that store of sense 
knowledge which is to constitute the elements of everything 
it is possible for him to be in after life; this material is the 
type with which he must set up the epic of his life. The 
amount of this material which the child gathers, and the man- 
ner in which the child learns it, constitute the limitation of 
what his life may be in any direction. All future knowledge 
and ideals have their fountain source here; in fact, the child’s 
destiny is determined during this critical period. A study of 
industry constitutes one of nature’s methods for subduing
-P-A-G-E-546
  544 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
well this world of sense knowledge, its uses, relations and 
causations. Through the study of the various forms of indus- 
try, he is taught to observe accurately all the qualities and 
relations and casual sequences of the different concrete matter 
which constitute the necessary objects of his study. 
I want it well understood at this point I would have no 
specialization in the study of industry here. The child has 
not only to get that concrete matter which is the necessary 
basis for a life of culture, but it is through a study of all the 
industries of the neighborhood at first hand, the doing of the 
actual industrial processes at school, and the imitation of 
these which cannot be actually done, that the child gets a 
revelation of his own vocational aptitudes. The neglect of this 
absolutely important part of a child’s education has caused 
the many vocational misfits in the world, with resulting human 
failure and general social deficiency. 
This training is necessary in an all-around education for 
every one. It matters not whether the pupil is to pursue what 
is known as an industrial vocation or not. How can a vocation 
be determined except by the response which the child gives 
to the study of these various vocations, studied in both a 
theoretical and practical way? Besides a life of culture should 
be desired for every human being, and in the study of indus- 
try the necessary elements of culture are obtained. 
A deeper study of the subject will show beyond question that 
all these ends are but elements of the one great end—life, for 
since each is a necessary ingredient, all can be better studied 
in their relation to each other. In fact, there is no twilight 
zone between any two of them; they are so closely related that 
one cannot be studied separate and apart from the others. 
Health, home, citizenship and industry are the constituent ele- 
ments of life. They must be taken together in education if 
we want well-rounded lives. 
From what I have read, the audience can see that I would 
have a complete reorganization and redirection of all the com- 
mon school forces, to the end that all that which is ob8olete 
and useless may be taken out of the curriculum; and that all 
that remains of the old course of study and the new material 
which we will find necessary to add to the curriculum should 
be correlated in order that great life-ends be attained; and
-P-A-G-E-547
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 5A5 
that the function of common schools may be not merely to 
teach abstract and unrelated text-book matter, but to give life, 
and life more abundantly. 
Let us briefly take up the teaching of industry in the high 
schools. The common schools and the colleges have doubtless 
been slow in adjusting themselves to modern demands, but 
when we compare the progress that they have made in the 
adustment of their work to the vital needs of life with the 
progress of the high schools in the same direction, we will find 
that the American high school is the Gibraltar which has 
been garrisoned and supplied to meet all the attacks of modern 
education on its most sacred course of study. Of course, its 
course of study is but a reflection of the old scholastic college 
course. The influences which have operated to make the com- 
mon schools and the colleges respond in some degree to the 
demands of educational experts, and of the masses of the peo- 
ple for industry as one of the essential elements in general 
education, have made little impression on the high schools. 
So tenaciously have our high schools held to their pristine 
standards, and so little heed have they given to these demands 
for the recognition of the industrial subjects, that the indus- 
trial classes all over the country have started propaganda for 
the establishment of agricultural and other forms of indus- 
trial high schools as a separate and distinct type of high 
schools. 
In almost if not all of the States of the South, schools of 
this character have been provided for by legislation, and a 
great many political units have taken advantage of the oppor- 
tunity thus afforded and have established these schools. To 
my mind, there are many reasons why we should not have 
separate industrial high schools. In the first place, it means a 
division of the available resources for high schools. In the 
South taxable values are low and population is sparse; it is 
hard to raise sufficient money to properly maintain one system 
of high schools as they should be maintained. If this policy is 
continued, it takes no prophet to see that the result’ will be 
that we will have no high schools worthy of the name. In the 
second place, if we had both the resources and the students 
to properly maintain these two systems of high schools, it 
would be bad policy to have the dual system. I cannot think 
35  
-P-A-G-E-548
  546 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
of any greater force for making a cleavage in society than to 
have one set of high schools where the students were required 
to spend a large part of their time in doing manual work, and 
another set of schools where the students never worked with 
their hands. The inevitable result would be that those who 
went to the classical school would think that they should have 
a monopoly of the professions and should dominate public 
affairs. On the other hand, the industrial high school would 
degenerate into cheap trade schools. Trade schools probably 
suit European life, but I trust the idea will never get a per- 
manent footing in America. 
America means opportunity. It matters not what social 
position a family may have, or what occupation the head has 
followed, the children should have the opportunity and encour- 
agement to follow their inclinations and aptitudes in selecting 
vocations. It is contrary to the most elementary principles of 
democracy to attempt to require or even suggest that the chil- 
dren should follow the occupations of the parents. Again, in- 
stead of making social distinctions based on industry, it should 
be the purpose of education to destroy whatever tendency there 
now is to rate a person’s social status by his occupation. All 
work is equally honorable. It is not what you do, but whether 
you do something, and how you do it, that should make you 
worthy of the respect and association of the noblest. It must 
be admitted that snobbery is on the increase. This tendency in 
American life should receive no encouragement from the 
schools. It is already talked by those who resent the recog- 
nition of the industrial subjects, but who see that their opposi- 
tion will be in vain, that the sons and daughters of the best 
families will attend the old-time schools, while only the lower 
classes will patronize the industrial schools. All of our boys 
and girls of every class and condition in society who go through 
the common schools, should have the opportunity of meeting 
together at the high school. They would here meet on equal 
terms, have the same start in life, and, by knowing each other 
better, have more respect for each other. The son of the banker, 
if he desires, should have the option and opportunity to be- 
come a scientific agriculturist; while the son of the farmer 
should find an unobstructed path to the banking-house, if his 
inclinations lead him in that direction.
-P-A-G-E-549

If one high school system is adopted, how could we accom- 
plish the work which it would be necessary to add, and at the 
same time teach the already overloaded present course of 
study? My reply here is the same as it was for the common 
schools. We should tear up, reorganize and redirect our re- 
sources. We will find that much time may be economized ; 
and that by a proper correlation of the subject-matter, with 
definite ends in view, the student could cover much more 
ground in a shorter time. If the student has been well taught 
in, the grammar school, he should have some definite idea as 
to what vocation he is especially adapted to; but in order to 
be sure that he does not make a mistake in his selection of a 
vocation, in the first year of the high school I would have 
him review those vocations which had attracted and interested 
him most in the lower school. After the first year I would 
have him to study the vocation he had selected as a life-work 
throughout the remainder of his high school course. Of course, 
! appreciate the fact that in small high schools of limited re- 
sources there would be a necessary limitation in the number 
of vocational subjects that could be offered. This is true, yet 
at the same time at least twenty-five per cent of the time of 
any high school should be given to vocational work, directly 
or indirectly; when the school is limited as to courses, of 
course there would be a smaller number of options for the 
student in selecting vocational work. I do not want to be mis- 
understood; I think every high school student should pursue 
vocational work, but by vocational work I do not mean exclu- 
sively manual work, though I would give such work as much 
credit and equal dignity as I would other forms of vocational 
work. Even in the smallest high schools in the South I think 
agriculture for boys and domestic science for girls should be 
taught, because the influence of the social environment would 
tend to make the majority of the boys adopt agriculture as a 
life work; while all of the girls will bear a vital relation to 
the home. 
The high school is the one point of attack; when it is cor- 
rectly organized and has the right spirit of work, all will be 
well with public education. It will then be that we can get a 
supply of well-trained teachers for the common schools. The 
colleges will be filled with bright students, who will have
-P-A-G-E-550
  548 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. - : 
definite aims. One of the old questions so much discussed at 
school associations, is whether the high schools should prepare 
for life or for college. This is no real question; when they are 
both studied out and organized for life, they will fit without 
strain. 
The large State colleges have probably gone in advance of 
other parts of the educational systems in working out and 
organizing education for economy and efficiency, yet they have 
- only begun the work; there are influential members of each 
of these college faculties who bemoan the trend of educational 
thought and practice; they would set the clock back on the 
dial of progress if they could, but the fiat has gone forth. The 
world is yet to be emancipated through the genius of univer- 
sal education. Education must increase the efficiency of all 
people. In a measure, all education is vocational. It is a 
wrong conception of education, viewed from any standpoint, 
to look on it as a means of avoiding the necessity of following 
some useful occupation. No class of people, it matters not 
what blood or position, has the right to subsist on the fruits 
of the labor of other classes. Society is wronged when an 
individual lives not by his own work, but reaps where others 
have sown. 
The future never looked brighter; more men of talent and 
training are now giving their lives to the study of these ques- 
tions than ever before in the history of education. The people 
are manifesting an unparalleled interest and are donating re- 
sources more lavishly than the greatest optimist of a quarter 
of a century ago would have prophesied. It is for us to see 
that this effort and these resources are not put forth in vain. 
Tt is for us to make all the tested truth real in actual work. 
The responsibility is on us. How shall we meet it? 
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION FOR WOMEN. 
AGNES HOUSTON CRAIG, DENTON, TEXAS, 
In one of his “Just-So Stores” Mr. Kipling has given us a 
delightful account of the first experiment in housekeeping. In 
part he says: “Of course the man is wild. He was dread- 
fully wild. He did not even begin to be tame till he met the 
woman, and she told him that she did not like living in his 
wild ways. She picked out a nice, dry cave, instead of a heap
-P-A-G-E-551
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 549 
of wet leaves; and she strewed clean sand on the floor; and she 
lit a nice fire of wood at the back of the cave; and she hung a 
dried wild-horse skin, tail down, across the opening of the cave, 
and she said, ‘Wipe your feet, dear, when you come in, and now 
we’ll keep house.’ ” 
In this brief paragraph Mr. Kipling has clearly stated two 
important facts that have direct bearing on our subject: first, 
the historical status of woman as the originator and patient 
developer of the home and of industrialism; and, secondly, 
woman’s natural progressiveness, great spirit of independence, 
and obvious power of self-development. 
Before and since the dawn of recorded history man has been 
wild. Fundamentally he is just as wild today, for witness cur- 
rent events to prove that he still represents the militant agent 
in human life. On the other hand, in spite of the attempt to 
establish a false ideal, ad absurdum, of woman as the weaker 
vessel, the dependent half of society, history will furnish us 
with ample proof that she always has been and today repre- 
sents, more than ever before, an active and intelligently pro- 
gressive spirit in civilization. She is a master builder. In- 
deed, the student of history will readily acknowledge that a 
large percentage of the great occupations that dignify this 
world’s most advanced forms of national life were built upon 
the solid foundation that woman’s inventive genius and pa- 
tient industry laid. The fact of industrial education for 
woman is not new; it is merely the form and method of acquir- 
ing it that has changed, for she has always been a tremendous 
industrial producer within the home, where she also received 
her inspiration and training. 
While man has been universally acknowledged as the agent 
in the “grocer forms of production,” it is not so long since he 
first began to recognize the commercial possibilities of the 
home industries pertaining to food, shelter and clothing; 
gradually monopolized them, and announced himself a dis- 
coverer when he was merely an acquirer; therefore, it is only 
natural that as a result of this shifting of interests man has 
resented the necessity of woman to either follow her natural 
occupations from the home to the door of the factory or to in- 
terest herself in new fields of activity. 
In former times the superfluous woman did one of two things.
-P-A-G-E-552
  550 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION.., 
she was a spinner or weaver in the home, assisting the house- 
wife in the common home industries, or she went into a con- 
vent. The change in modern economic conditions has meant 
readjustment for a large class of women, but it also meant 
progress and broader horizon. During this period of transi- 
tion there have been some gropings. Man has been known to be 
patronizing in attitude, to say that woman’s mind is not made 
of so fine or philosophic clay as his, that she is incapable of the 
same degree of culture, and that she should have a special form 
of training—perchance industrial education. 
Do we detect in this recommendation a trace of mere man’s 
proverbial selfishness? However that may be, in selecting for 
her this form of education he has perhaps unwittingly, but 
none the less truly, offered her the greatest possible opportu- 
nity for the acquisition of broad culture and unlimited useful- 
ness. To accomplish these results, however, industrial educa- 
tion must be organized in its relation to woman’s fields of 
activities and along broad lines. It cannot be successful or 
permanent if it is purely technical in nature. The trained 
hand must have the trained mind behind it. For this reason 
it may be well to consider it from three aspects: first, its pecu- 
liar suitability to woman, the scope of interest included in its 
content, and the method of presentation. 
Undoubtedly the best known as well as the most funda- 
mental of all time-honored institutions is the home. It is 
woman’s realm, At the same time that it is the most general 
and the oldest of institutions, it is the worst organized of them 
all. Each individual home is a law unto itself so far as stand- 
ards of management are concerned. 
In political economy, that “socia! science of business,” man 
is today chiefly concerned with the activities pertaining to pro- 
duction, although woman does contibute to some extent to this 
department. On the other hand, the home undoubtedly per- 
forms the most important function in the field of consump- 
tion, which really determines the character and to a large ex- 
tent the range of production. In this field, because of her su- 
premacy within the home, the woman must be acknowledged 
as preéminently the regulator. To avoid economic ruin we 
expect to find business activities of a public nature systemat- 
ically operated, and for this reason we have established there a
-P-A-G-E-553

system of units. If this method of systematic order is essen- 
tial to the measurement of values in the business world, it 
would appear reasonable to expect more universal success 
in the art of home making if the same principles were ap- 
plied to the conduct of its multifarious duties and activities, 
any yet it does not occur to the average house keeper or edu- 
cator that home making is a business second to none in im- 
portance, and that as such it should be economically planned 
and scientifically operated. So far we have discussed woman 
within the home, but we must not forget her sister wage earner. 
Spinners and weavers have no industrial place in the average 
modern home. Futhermore, it is no longer fashionable or 
necessary to go into a convent, consequently the superfluous 
woman has been forced into the business world, for if she 
would live she must work. On this basis the logical conclu- 
sion must be that since woman is the inheriter of industrial- 
ism, and since she does actively participate in an important 
way in the economic activity of both home and the business 
world, she should do so consciously and intelligently. Since 
she controls consumption to so large an extent, through it 
really furnishing the chief incentive to productive activity, it 
is as necessary that she be trained in the scientific manage- 
ment of the income, whether as a home maker or as a wage 
earner, as that man shall understand the economic laws gov- 
erning the acquisition, exchange and general use of wealth. 
In his splendid paper on “The Economic Function of 
Women” Dr. Devine says: “If acquisition is the idea which 
in the past history of economics has been all but unduly empha- 
sized, expenditure is the idea which the future of ‘the scheme 
will place beside it. It is this change that involves a revolu- 
tion in the attitude of the science toward the function of 
woman.” With this hypethesis clearly established, can there 
be any reasonable doubt as to the appropriateness of industrial 
education for women? 
On the other hand, there seems to be more difficulty in set- 
tling on the form and content of this education, in determining 
and classifying the essentials entering into it, than in proving 
its appropriateness to modern needs. Up to very recently the 
general conception of it has been within painfully circum- 
scribed limits, and in the majority of cases technical drill has

commanded our attention to the exclusion of important funda- 
mental training. Considering this distinct and important 
economic function of woman, does it not seem reasonable that 
her education should be built first of all on an economic basis. 
Supposing this premise to be granted, should she not there- 
fore be trained in certain forms of exact knowledge. In other 
words, is not the germanic idea of gradual, solid development 
along scientific lines, with the fundamental economic idea as 
basic, the one that should enter into our educational method? 
Before we can construct an adequate type of industrial edu- 
cation, we must first recognize all the factors entering into our 
problem. We believe that woman, consciously or uncon- 
sciously, carries the burden of a heavy economic responsibil- 
ity which finds expression in two general types of activities: 
those represented in the household arts, which are of percu- - 
liar interest to the home maker; and those embodied in the 
great variety of industrial arts that engage the interests of 
wage earners. As the home-maker woman is most vitally con- 
cerned with the expenditure of the income and in the control of 
the various avenues of waste within the home, such as the 
waste of money, time, muscular and physical energy and com- 
modities themselves, she is above all else regulating consump- 
tion. On the other hand, the wage earner, in addition to her 
capacity as such, should understand and be able to practice 
the most important laws of right living, for if she is also a 
home maker, as many are, she has to carry an added responsi- 
bility. Whatever her status, education should prepare every 
woman that it touches to elevate materially the standard of 
living and‘the average efficiency in all productive labor. 
Since home problems command the interest of the larger per 
cent of women, let us consider them first. Above all, the home 
is a great educational institution. Within it most of our 
ideals and tendencies toward right living and culture are fos- 
tered or smothered. There we find the environment that more ' 
than any other will influence our formative years, determining 
our ultimate mental and moral sense of comparative values. 
We also perform more of the acts contributory to the forma- 
tion of life-long habits, the sum total of which determine char- 
acter. Mr. Burbank, in his “Training of the Human Plant,” 
says: “What we call character is heredity and environment in
-P-A-G-E-555
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 553 
combination, and heredity being only stored environment, our 
duty and privilege is to make this stored environment of the 
best quality.” So character building must be done to a large 
extent within the home, which is nearly every child’s first 
school. It is the sum total of the individual habits of the 
family that determines home atmosphere. Who is responsi- 
ble for this? The mother? Should she then be a trained 
teacher? 
Is it not also true that the average quality of the homes and 
their immediate surroundings establishes the moral and intel- 
lectual tone of a community? To build still further, would it 
not follow that the balance of the spiritual, intellectual and 
physical health of any people as a whole determines the ideals, 
integrity and power of a nation? If these questions can be 
answered in the affirmative, the home institution is indeed 
basic in education, and the responsibility each mother holds in 
directing the development of human ideals, individual or na- 
tional, is incalculable. 
Working on this hypothesis, as the basis of early educational 
accomplishment it is within the home that all problems of re- 
form should begin, and it is safe to say that many of the social 
evils, if thus dealt with, could be greatly reduced and effect- 
ively controlled. Thus we have added to her economic respon- 
sibility a social,one coérdinate in importance. In fact, together 
they constitute conditions that if successfully managed must 
be handled by trained minds, able to recognize the relative 
values of all the factors entering into the business of home 
making; capable of exercising scientific judgment with a view 
to controlling consequences and familiar with the underlying 
principles of scientific management. 
Women of this class should be intelligently interested in the 
economic, social and constructive significance of such subject- 
matter as has direct bearing on the unified institution of the 
home. Briefly enumerated, this material may be represented 
in such subjects as pertain directly to every-day activities, have 
a tendency to raise appreciably the average standard of living 
by creating higher and saner ideals of common things, and by 
developing greater efficiency in the performance of common 
familiar activities. Community health and efficiency depends 
largely on the intelligent administration to individnal needs
-P-A-G-E-556
  554 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
for food, shelter and clothing, while the cultural and moral 
standards reflect the home atmosphere prevailing in each indi- 
vidual household as a result of the economic allowance made 
for the cultivation of the higher life, which is dependent on the 
congenial and inspiring presence of some good literature, 
music, educational opportunities, good art in form and color, 
pictures and desirable and interesting forms of entertainment. 
Therefore every housewife is directly concerned with the prob- 
lems involved in home architecture, home decoration, home fur- 
nishings, landscape gardening in its relation to home esthetics 
and the broader civic improvement interest, health problems 
and sanitation in every phase, trade conditions, methods of 
management and social consumption. 
With reference to industrial education for working girls, the 
field for discussion is so vast that it cannot be comprehensively 
considered here. Of one thing we are convinced, as human 
beings with the recognized ability to contribute something 
toward the economic fabric of our modern life, their education 
should not aim merely to make machines of them. In addition 
to business efficiency, they should also be trained to social 
efficiency through healthful, happy and orderly living. Fur- 
thermore, the woman who starts out as a wage earner always 
has the possible prospect of becoming a home maker. 
With a full consciousness that the arguments sustaining the 
desirability of industrial education for women have not been 
by any means adequately discussed, and that the content of 
this form of education is no more than intimated in this paper, 
it is however necessary now to touch upon the general practice 
in the method of conducting industrial instruction, whether 
in household arts or in the more bewildering industrial arts. 
Of two facts we can speak with the conviction of knowledge: 
the industrial movement, as an educational interest, has al- 
ready come in touch with general education through its voca- 
tional classes in both the elementary and secondary schools; 
and many individuals outside the school-teaching profession 
are more alive to the need of broad and fundamental training 
as prerequisite to worthy results in this field than are some of 
our educators that are attempting to construct it. The main 
reason for this condition may be that these persons without 
the pale understand more clearly, from actual experience, the
-P-A-G-E-557
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 555 
conditions on which technical proficiency and real commercial 
values depend, than do many of our educational theorists. 
One of the things about which we as an American nation are 
excessively fond of boasting is our practical turn of mind. We 
have had the pleasure of being forced to listen to a large num- 
ber of men who consider themselves educators, announce from 
platforms that intellectual training is all well and good, but 
that for women especially the practical training of the hand is 
far more important. In almost every such case the party thus 
expressing himself proclaims to the world the fact that he him- 
self has enjoyed neither form of training, and it would be use- 
less to suggest to such the truth that a trained hand needs be 
directed and controlled by a trained mind. And yet many 
men of this type are holding positions of authority as princi- 
pals and supervisors and are actually allowed to hamper un- 
speakably through their narrow-minded policies the logical de- 
velopment of this worthy system of education. 
So far as our boastfulness in favor of the practical is con- 
cerned, permit me to say that it is not altogether creditable to 
harp too long and loudly on that one string because it indicates 
a lack of nice balance, too materialistic a tendency, and ad- 
vertises us as still in the infancy of our real educational de- 
velopment. Rather let us strive for the happy middle ground, 
establishing so far as it is possible to do so the right relation- 
ships of the practical, the intellectual and the spiritual, and 
then let it be our aim to maintain it. 
This idea of developing the practical is the keynote to much 
of our inefficient industrial instruction. In the majority of 
schools, technical practice is over-emphasized and is introduced 
too soon. We lose sight of the fact that the natural occupa- 
tion for the vernal, undeveloped mind should be the acquiring 
of inspirational knowledge in the fundamentals that will de- 
velop in it the power of self-expression. Instead, we are too 
often demanding productive work from novices who have no 
ideas ready for expression. There are two requisites to effect- 
ive expression of any kind: knowledge born of experience or 
resulting from acquired knowledge; and the power of clear 
and orderly thought resulting from the habit of reflection. AII 
ideas that develop into worthy forms of expression, whether 
it be literary, musical, architectural, costumic, dramatic or
-P-A-G-E-558
556 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
what not, must be developed slowly from minds carefully 
trained in the fundamentals that establish the necessary con- 
ditions to productive activity. In a large majority of cases 
this intellectual growth is not only neglected, but it is actually 
retarded. Then we wonder why results are so mediocre. 
Before technical work is taken up to any extent students 
should be carefully and systematiccaly drilled in the formation 
of the habits of close and accurate observation, concentration 
of mind on whatever subjects he is required to study, and Jog- 
ical thinking through legitimate and suitable forms of expres- 
sion. 
For training the mind in these habits of orderly activity 
there are few subjects more valuable than the physical sciences 
and ‘thorough drill in the principles of drawing and design. 
Furthermore a worthy form of accomplishment in either the 
household or the industrial arts depends absolutely on the 
working knowledge of the fundamental principles developed in 
these two great departments of scientific and artistic knowledge. 
It is on these that real economic value depends, and the stu- 
dent of average ability who is thus thoroughly and carefully 
prepared in the power of evolving good ideas will find little 
difficulty in producing well a thought or message when he 
really has one worthy of expression. 
THE PROGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION IN COL- 
LEGES FOR WOMEN IN THE SOUTHERN STATES. 
W. B. BIZZEL, DENTON, TEXAS, 
The Twenty-seventh Legislature of the State of Texas, in 
April, 1901, passed a law that brought into existence the Col- 
lege of Industrial Arts, which was subsequently located by a 
commission at Denton, Texas. The college opened its first 
term’s work on September 23, 1903. In taking this step Texas 
put herself in line with the most progressive school sentiment 
of the country. 
The college gives recognition to the truth that woman has 
always been a worker, and that her relation to industry has 
from primitive times been a vital one. The industrial sphere 
of woman has constantly widened with the passing years. Out 
of a total of 336 occupations now classified, woman has entered 
295 of them. Her activities find expression in all the indus- 
   
-P-A-G-E-559
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 557 
tries and vocations, from needle-work on one extreme to marine 
engineering and wireless telegraphy on our ocean steamers on 
the other. There are over 23,000,000 women over sixteen years 
of age in the United States, and 5,000,000 out of this number 
are engaged in gainful pursuits. The system of State sup- 
ported schools, created to subserve the interest of all the peo- 
ple, would be narrow and inefficient if it did not include appro- 
priate training for women in the face of these facts. 
The condition of vital concern results from the fact that in a 
large percentage of the women employed in gainful occupations 
continue such employment for only a limited time. A primary 
and fundamental essential calling of women will ever be that 
of home making, and into this calling a large percentage of 
those gainfully employed will ultimately go. For efficiency in 
the home every woman needs special scientific training. We are, 
therefore, confronted with the complicated problem of prepar- 
ing every girl in the nation for two vocations—one that of a 
wage earner, and the other that of a home builder. The recog- 
nition of this principle has brought into existence in his coun- 
try a class of colleges created and established for the purpose of 
meeting this intricate demand. This is the task assigned to 
the College of Industrial Arts of Texas. Its courses of study 
have been designed to-.emphasize both these phases. 
An important consideration underlying the whole problem of 
the training of women is that of inculcating all vocations that 
will prepare her either philosophically or sociologically for the 
home after she becomes the ‘mistress of a home. There are 
some vocations—such as millinery, dry cleaning, dyeing gar- 
ments and needle trades—that not only offer remunerative em- 
ployment, but contribute practically to household efficiency. 
There are other vocations to which she may be called that 
would leave her feeble and incapacitated for home life. Edu- 
cators entrusted with making curriculums for colleges for 
women should study profoundly the sociological significance 
of our vocational life and so restrict the interest of women in 
both spheres of action. 
Another problem of fundamental concern is the adaptation 
of the college curriculum to the vocational demands of the re- 
spective sections from which the college constituency may come. 
For instance, the course of study for the Manhattan Training
-P-A-G-E-560
558 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
School in New York City would not be applicable for Texas 
conditions. In a section where there are many large cities, the 
demand for women workers would differ widely from a country 
where the people are largely rural, the cities widely separated 
and small. In the South there is little demand for vocational 
institutes designed to train servant girls. In a number of 
Northern cities this is one of the most important departments 
of industrial schools. 
The fundamental problem in the industrial colleges for 
women in the South is to prepare young women for the highest 
efficiency as wives and mothers. The problem is wider than 
to merely learn to cook and sew. Our people need to learn that 
these are only two of a number of important industrial depart- 
ments, all bearing a definite relation to the home. The larger 
problem of household efficiency includes a knowledge of how to 
conserve energy, time and money, to properly proportion in- 
come between food, shelter and clothing, and to eliminate waste. 
A girl also needs to learn how to eliminate drudgery from the 
work of the home by means of system and order. To subserve 
this purpose, every industrial college for women should provide 
some means on instruction in practical housekeeping.

SOUTHERN NORMALS AND THE SOUTHERN COMMON 
SCHOOL TEACHER. 
J. BE, PEARCE, AUSTIN, TEXAS. 
The normal school had its origin in the general division of 
labor incident to the development of civilization itself. The 
“teaching of how to teach” goes back to the Renaissance, when 
our complicated modern society had its birth. Efforts at train- 
ing for teaching are nearly as old as schools of law and of 
medicine, but the first school to which the term normal was 
applied was founded in Vienna in 1771. Literally a normal 
school is a natural, therefore an ideal or model, school. The 
originators of the normal had an inadequate idea of relativity 
of human knowledge and of the multifarious character of edu- 
cational needs. It was supposed that there was one form of 
education, an ideal form, which once found and understood 
would fit men for all kinds of living. That notion has not en- 
tirely disappeared from the world as yet. There are those 
who, steeped in a given sort of learning, believe that their 
learning is essential to the educational salvation of humanity. 
They hold an educational “saying faith.” Naturally the older 
forms of learning are worshipped most devoutly. They are 
finally modified, or they die when they have become so 
anomalous as to excite ridicule. 
The best thinkers now realize that education is a purely 
relative matter and that there are as many forms of true edu- 
cation as there are complicated, technical employments. He is 
the fittest member of a complicated society who can perform 
some one social service in the completest and fullest way. The 
growing complexity of our society, from new inventions and 
the introduction of machinery, from the rapid transportation of 
people, of materials and of news, from the urbanization of the 
populace, from the concentration of wealth and industry, and 
above all from the rapid growth of scientific knowledge, gives
-P-A-G-E-562
    560 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 4 
rise to new trades and to new professions yearly. There is no 
proper aristocracy among the trades and professions, and all 
should have equal rights in institutions supported at public 
expense. To specialize in education, therefore, is as logical 
and as imperative as to specialize in vocation. It follows that 
an adequate system of education must epitomize the com- 
plicated diverse labors of men, in order to fit the youth for 
the more serious life of adult citizenship. No one school can 
contain in itself all parts of such a school system; hence it 
follows that schools, too, must specialize. 
The normal schools have been slow to realize the above stated 
truth, and have not always adjusted themselves readily to 
the work which they can do best and ought to do. However, 
adjustment is going on and the Committee on Normal Schools 
of the N. E. A. some years ago reported that the normal schools 
of the country differed materially in the various sections of 
the Union, and divided them accordingly into Northeastern, 
Middle Western, Pacific or Far Western, and Southern. With 
the first three groups this paper has nothing to do, except per- 
haps for purposes of illustrating general principles. 
Throughout the Union cities draw very little upon the grad- 
uates of State normals for their teachers. Even in Massachu- 
setts, the home of normal schools and the State in which pos- 
sibly they have their greatest importance, only 31 per cent of 
the public school teachers have normal school training, and 
much the largest proportion of these are undoubtedly to be 
found at work in the country and small towns. Cities, through 
their heavy and extensive high school curricula, through nor- 
mals of their own adapted to their special needs, and through 
the colleges and universities within their limits with their 
departments of education, are able to get teachers with a bet- 
ter average equipment for teaching than State normal schools 
can give. The high schools of even the small towns prefer the 
graduates of colleges and universities for teachers to those of 
normals, since even in these schools extensive and thorough 
scholarship is more essential to good teaching than a knowl- 
edge of methods, the thing for which the normal school stands 
particularly. 
We are ready to consider now the definite service which 
Southern normal schools should render the common schools of
-P-A-G-E-563
  JOURNAL OF PROOEEDINGS. 561 
the South. The writer confines this discussion to State nor- 
mals, and leaves out of the discussion the city normals that 
exist, or may exist, with the peculiar courses and aims which 
they should have in order to meet the particular needs of their 
patrons and beneficiaries. We are justified in assuming now, 
I think, that the normal must find its field in preparing 
teachers for the schools of the country, of the village and of the 
little town, and for the elementary schools of towns of a larger 
size that have no higher educational institutions within their 
limits. They will find ultimately, the writer thinks, their great- 
est field of usefulness in fitting teachers for the country schools. 
Let us consider the present conditions in these schools, and 
then the conditions which should obtain; we shall then have 
nearly accomplished the purpose of this paper. 
Public school education in the South lags far behind that 
of other sections of the country. This fact is so obvious as to 
need only mention to have it accepted. Furthermore, this back- 
wardness is concentrated in the country and small towns, the 
proper field we shall now assume for the future labors of the 
normal school. The city schools of the South are little inferior 
to those of the other sections, which means, considering the 
general backwardness of the South educationally, that the 
country schools are in a woeful state of inferiority and in- 
adequacy. In Texas the country school is run entirely, with 
few exceptions, out of the State apportionment, which averages 
from $6 to $7 per pupil per annum. A few communities have 
been brought, by the recent movement to improve these schools, 
to levy a local tax and subscribe funds to build decent school 
houses and to pay a better salary for a longer term. As yet 
the average country school term in Texas is 116 days, and the 
average salary is $57 per school month. If the few creditable 
schools that have a local tax were taken out, the average term 
would be much less and the average salary much lower. These 
schools have absolutely no beginning of domestic science for 
girls and only the meagerest beginnings of agriculture for boys. 
Their teachers are very largely young girls from the cities, 
whose youth or poor scholarship prevent them from finding 
employment in the city, who know nothing of country life and 
of country needs, and whose efforts at teaching the country 
36

youth, often older than herself, would be amusing if not so 
unfortunate. 
The result of all this is that the country home is almost bar- 
barian in its crudity; that agriculture, the greatest industry 
of the land, languishes and the great natural resources of forest 
and fertile soil are wastefully exhausted without being renewed, 
and that ignorance and ultra conservatism characterize the 
farmer. This last is evidenced in the farmer’s vote, when some 
one proposes to levy a tax to build a school or to construct a 
serviceable highway, or when an intelligent patriot and a graft- 
ing, self-seeking politician are seeking election to the same 
high office. The migration to the city of the ambitious and in- 
telligent elements of the country population is due more, in 
the opinion of the writer, to the wretched schools of the coun- 
try and the better schools of the city than to all other causes 
combined. 
But in the long run, it is the country population of every 
land that constitutes its bone and sinew. The problems of 
keeping a people healthy, thrifty and moral, are much more 
serious and difficult of solution in cities than in the country. 
The wisest measures that can possibly be devised to solve these 
problems will still leave the cities in a great measure a species 
of Minotaur devouring the youth of the land. The most prec- 
ious treasure of any land is its healthy blood, and every 
agency in civilized life that tends to pollute or degrade that 
blood is to be fought by the nations as men fight grim death. 
War and the evils of city life are the most baneful influences 
that curse the life of civilized man. They use up the strong 
and efficient, and leave the inefficient and the weak to propagate 
the nation. 
Let us contrast the city and the country for a moment as 
reacting environments upon the character of growing youth. 
In the country exists necessarily simplicity of taste and of 
living; in the city, luxury and expensive artificial tastes; in 
the country, beauty of nature that begets taste for beauty; in 
the city, brick walls, sun-baked pavement and grimy, fume- 
ladened atmosphere; in the country, quiet and peace with soft- 
ened natural light and the natural darkness of the night, in 
which sleep is sweet and restorative; in the city, one hideous 
din, night and day, of whistles, horns, bells and roaring trains,
-P-A-G-E-565
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 563 
and at night the fierce glare of artificial lights diabolically 
switched on and off to torture sensitive retina in the interests 
of Pear’s soap, Duffty’s Malt Whiskey, or Anna Held cigars. 
This din and glare perpetually irritate the auditory and optic 
nerves and exhaust the general nervous system often to deple- 
tion. In the country property and plenty are the proceeds of 
honest labor; in the city, unwholesome wealth is piled up 
through the toil of other men who must live in squalor and 
misery ; in the city a thousand distractions exist for the youth— 
the theater, the picture show, the vaudeville, the street pageant, 
the concert, the ball, to take the mind from study and from 
work, if indeed work can be found for youths in the city; in 
the country the growing corn, the breeding kine, and nature’s 
activities to observe, to study and to take part in, and above 
all the wholesome necessity of constant labor and regular 
habits. In the city the saloon and the gaming houses ever 
beckon to the boy, while the private liaison and the brothel 
seek the destruction of the girl. In the country pure women 
and virile men marry early and have large families of lusty, 
healthy boys and girls; in the city the tendency is to late mar- 
riages, or none, and to few children, weaker physically than in 
the country, and forever tempted to indolence and immorality. 
Health of body and of mind are of the first importance to 
every nation, and their decay explains the decay of the nations. 
“Their importance has been recognized so far as they have been 
understood,” says Havelock Ellis, “in every great period of 
civilization of which we have much knowledge, as Roman and 
Moorish ruins alone suffice to testify. That they are not so 
recognized today is the chief element of rottenness in our 
civilization. We postpone laying the foundations of our social 
structure in order to elaborate its pinnacles. We have not yet 
learned that a great civilization is ill built up on the bodies 
of men and women enfeebled and distorted by overwork, filth 
and disease.” 
But there is another side to this contrast which we must 
examine, and we shall then be ready for our conclusions, which 
may then be brief, but perhaps nonetheless logical and com- 
plete. In the country in the South, the average child goes to 
school probably from three to four months to a shoddy, cheap 
teacher, who has no facilities but an ugly, uncomfortable, un-

scientific building, and is taught only reading, writing and 
arithmetic; in the city any child may go to school nine or 
ten months to a teacher with good scholastic attainments, and 
in a modern building, clean, sanitary and often scientifically 
built. The city child gets good teaching in all that vast body of 
knowledge, the accumulation of the ages, which is the common 
heritage of the race and which constitutes the soul of civiliza- 
tion. In addition, he has access to all sorts of special learning 
and training which will fit him for a creditable part in a 
special field of work, or that lead to peculiar refinement of 
tastes and character. The boy may have manual training, a 
business course, electrical, mechanical and architectural 
courses, or any foreign language. The girl may have foreign 
language, domestic science, which leads to scientific home- 
making and home-keeping, and which enables the intelligent 
woman to double the returns from the expense money put at 
her disposal. She may have training in music and art for 
refining herself and her future home, or she may have business 
courses, or courses in nursing or medicine, that will enable 
her to live in dignity and independence should she elect or 
be forced to forego the joys of a home of her own. 
Now, let us go to our conclusions. The normal schools must 
remedy the injustice now done the child born and reared in 
the country and provide him, in addition to the advantages 
given him by his environment, with all the essential privileges 
that the city-born child now enjoys. The country will then be 
not merely a source of scanty food for men and a place where 
scrubby men “breed with a rabbit-like indifference to conse- 
quences,” but the intelligently organized home and breeding 
ground of an ever-improving humanity. To accomplish this 
purpose the normal must study country and village life, deter- 
mine what is necessary and practicable in making it what it 
should be, and then put those things into its curriculum. 
If I were making out the curriculum of a Southern State 
normal school, I should put into it the following subjects, and 
their relative importance would be indicated by the order. This 
curriculum should comprise four years of close study for 
graduation, unless high school graduation or its equivalent 
is insisted on for entrance to the normal; in this case the 
normal course should, I think, but cut to two years. First  
-P-A-G-E-567

and most important, I should have a heavy course of English 
running through the four years and prescribed for all. In no 
one thing did the old Greeks show their universal wisdom in 
a higher degree than in the emphasis which they placed upon 
the study of their vernacular. They made no study of foreign 
tongues, but gave concentrated attention to their own, with the 
result that they wrote it and spoke it with a fluency and force 
never equaled in the use of vernacular by any other people. 
Mastery of the mother tongue is the key to everything, and 
the degree of that mastery is not a bad index to the educa- 
tional development of children or men. I should have a four 
years’ course in mathematics, with the last year optional. 
I would prescribe for boys four years of serious, earnest, 
natural science, comprising physics, chemistry, biology, 
physiology and geology, leaving the first two optional for girls. 
Natural science cannot be overdone. It lies at the root of 
almost everything worth while in our life today, and most that 
is vicious in the life of our people would be eliminated by a 
broad general knowledge of it. Its methods of observation and 
induction is the method that must be applied to the solution 
of all practical problems of life. Science is to be appreciated 
not only for the positive means it affords of advancing human 
welfare, but for the harmful nonsense it eliminates from the 
life of the people. Mental healing, telepathy, spiritism, miracle 
mongering, whether it comes from the superstitious of the past 
or springs from the badly organized brain of the present, be- 
come impossible in its light; while patent medicines and other 
forms of quackery disappear from its presence. Above all 
things, science is the basis of adequate preservation of health, 
and every particle of scientific truth which can be applied to 
the health of the people in their homes should be put within 
the reach of those homes. This can be done only through the 
schools, and so must come from the institutions which train 
the teachers for the schools. Dr. Jordan says that natural 
science is the most important part of secondary school work. 
If he is right in this opinion, and the writer has the profound- 
est respect for any utterance from him, it should certainly 
have the same place in the normal school curriculum. 
A four years course in hisory and social sciences should be 
prescribed for all. History and primitive sociology trace the

development of civilization and are essential to understanding 
the purposes, the nature and the effects of institutions. The 
citizen who does not possess such a knowledge has little more 
effect in bringing about the intelligent direction of his society 
than has a domestic animal. It is a crime, therefore, for those 
who teach young citizens to be without such knowledge. Time 
for such study can be obtained in part by cutting out of the 
present normal school course much of the stuff that goes under 
the name of the “history of education.” Of what practical use 
is it to the common school teacher to know about the vagaries 
of such visionaries as Basedow, Pestalozzi and Comenins? The 
social and natural sciences combine to give the educated man 
of today his working philosophy of life, his ideas of relative 
values. They help him to know appearance from reality, truth 
from sham, and to live to the best advantage for himself and 
for society. All sound schooling must emphasize them and 
great stress must be put upon them in the schooling that leads 
to teaching. 
The academic work so far mentioned should differ little in 
character or method of handling from the work done in these 
subjects in the best high schools and colleges. The normal 
school should never confine itself to “teaching how to teach.” 
Its efforts at doing this in the past has resulted in vitiating 
the standards of education in the minds of its graduates, and 
in their being turned out upon society a lot of utterly super- 
ficial, self-satisfied young people, who talked glibly about things 
of which they knew little and who deserved and received the 
scorn of all earnest, well-trained scholars. Its former short. 
shallow courses gave the normal over the country an ugly 
reputation, to recover from which it has yet something to do. 
As sound and thorough-going State academies, there is ample 
room for normals; in fact, they are badly needed; and they 
should never allow a young man or young woman to leave their 
doors bearing their stamp without scholarship as sound as 
-could be had in any other school in like time. 
A professional course in teaching should run through the 
four years, a part only of which perhaps should be prescribed, 
viz., one year in psychology and one in school organization and 
management. To these should be added optionals in school 
administration, history of education, study of education in
-P-A-G-E-569
  JOURNAL OF PROOEEDINGS. 567 
other lands, ete., to be taken chiefly perhaps by graduates in 
vacation sessions. All normals should hold vacation sessions 
in morning hours for three months to replace the present ob- 
noxious four-week examination-cramming summer normal. 
Foreign languages I would provide as optional, but would dis- 
courage generally, except a two-year reading course in Latin, 
for the sake of tracing English etymologies. In the writer’s 
opinion, they are far too high appraised in all modern higher 
education, and the undue study given them leads to a vast 
amount of wasted time, badly needed for doing more impor- 
tant things that can now hardly be gotten into the badly- 
crowded curriculum. 
Vocational subjects must find place in the normals if they 
are to do in any adequate way the work that the writer thinks 
they should do. In this connection the education of the sexes 
should be sharply differentiated. There is probably no obses- 
sion more productive of evil in American life today than that 
which afilicts so many people to the effect that men and women 
are exactly alike mentally, and that their physical differences 
need not interfere with their doing quite the same work in 
the world. The division of labor among men is the most far- 
reaching principle of civilization, and the greatest of all 
divisions of labor is that which runs along the line of sex. This 
division always becomes more profound as a people become 
more enlightened. It was a dishonest trick to woman to force 
her to take unmodified the education worked out for men when 
she was admitted to the benefits of higher education. All 
_ Schools above the elementary, to which girls and women are 
admitted, should have sound, thorough courses in domestic 
economy and domestic arts. In the normal schools this line 
of work should be heavily stressed. To those who know the 
conditions in the country homes of the South at present, the 
dirt and disease, the wretched cooking, the ill-fitting, shoddy 
clothing, the bed-bugs, flies and mosquitoes, and above all the 
monotonous drudgery and the lack of wholesome recreation 
for the wife and mother, their contemplation is painful. Is it 
any wonder that such a large disproportion of the inmates of 
asylums are women from the farms? At one time 44 per cent 
of the inmates of one of the Texas asylums were farmers’ wives, 
while this class constituted probably less than 25 per cent of  
-P-A-G-E-570
    
568 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
the adult population of the State. Bathtubs in farm houses in 
the South as yet are rare indeed, while screened houses are 
virtually unknown. Typhoid and sore eyes from filthy flies, 
and malaria from mosquitoes are constantly in evidence. All 
this must be changed and the normal school must change it by 
having its graduates teach scientific home making in the coun- 
try school. 
The country boy should, of course, be taught agriculture. 
The most expensive piece of stupidity probably in the indus- 
trial world today is to be found in the manner in which the 
average Southern farm is run. If the science already known 
and at hand which would bear upon the industry of farming 
could be put into practice at once, the annual returns from 
Texas farms would be more than doubled. Furthermore, the 
expense of putting that science into the hands of the next 
generation of farmers would be but a meager fraction of the 
return. The farmer cannot help himself; neither water nor 
learning can rise above its level. The State must do it, and a 
good agency is already at hand in the normal schools. They 
should be supplemented by agricultural high schools, numerous 
and easy of access to the farmer boy, but closely affiliated with 
the normals and the State A. & M. college. In Wisconsin agri- 
culture is taught by the State University, which includes very 
properly its A. & M. College, and by a perfect system of 
articulated schools below, with the result that agriculture 
flourishes there as nowhere else in this country. The normal 
course in agriculture should be made to include horticulture, 
stock raising and forestry. The vocational training of boys and 
girls for their respective duties in life, presupposes at least 
one man teacher and one woman teacher in every mixed school, 
and this presupposition, the writer thinks, should be turned 
into a condition as fast as practicable. 
There should be a special course in school administration to 
fit for the duties of county superintendents and county super- 
visors. In Massachusetts these officers are sufficiently numer- 
ous to enable them to meet the demand of the law that each 
school shall be visited at least twice a session. The lack of 
supervision of country schools is a great source of needless 
waste of public money and of educational opportunity. The 
best workmen work daily when sent off to themselves, and when
-P-A-G-E-571
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 569 
they are never seen by those who know what their work should 
be, and who have authority. The normal school should be free 
from politics; otherwise it cannot lead or train leaders. It 
should be supported perhaps as in Colorado by a tax levied in 
the Constitution. Its faculty should be made up of graduates 
of first-class colleges and universities who have taken the edu- 
cational courses in these institutions. It should never employ 
its own graduates, unless they have had heavier training else- 
where. Such a course results in inbreeding, which always pro- 
duce “educational dry-rot.” The normals must modify their 
courses to meet the needs of a growing, changing society, and 
teach their graduates to vote and to think independently, and 
to serve the communities in which they labor as social experts. 
They would thus shame those who speak of the “stolid con- 
servatism of the schoolmaster.” They must be on the alert to 
find out and propagate every new idea that can improve the 
life of the people, such as the social center movement and the 
movement for good roads. 
To sum up: The State normal school has one and only one 
all-important duty to perform, viz., to serve the common schools 
through the common school teacher, and chiefly the common 
schools of the country and of the small town. It is little needed 
by the city, which, with adequate high schools, with colleges, 
with normals of its own, and more especially with its dense 
population and consequent better opportunity for social organi- 
zation, can take care of itself. The normal is the State’s chief 
means of righting the present gross educational injustice to 
the country child. To this end State normals should study 
country needs and country possibilities, and to get time for it 
should leave off much of the fantastic and unprofitable “his- 
tory of education,” much of the cut and dried rule-of-thumb 
“methods and management” for which it has been noted in the 
past, and emphasize sound general scholarship and the study of 
natural sciences. It must emphasize history, economics and 
sociology, so as to give the country man an intelligent grasp of 
social problems, a proper sense of civic duty, and a love of 
civic righteousness. Finally, it must lay heavy stress upon 
scientific farming and scientific homemaking and home-keep- 
ing, to the end that the present woefully inefficient, backward 
and wasteful methods in Southern agriculture shall cease, and

that Southern country homes may be as clean, as healthy, and 
as conducive to high standards of living and to happiness as 
those of Wisconsin, of Massachusetts, or of France. 
I have not talked of what the normal should do for the com- 
mon school teacher, for it is evident that what the normal does 
unto its graduates, they in turn will do unto the common school 
and unto the communities which they shall serve. 
PRACTICAL FUNCTIONS OF A SCHOOL OF EDUCATION 
IN STATE UNIVERSITIES. 
PROF, BIRD 'T, BALDWIN, AUSTIN, TEXAS. 
The professional training of elementary and secondary school 
teachers has made such rapid progress during the past five 
years that we are in the midst of the most constructive period 
in the history of educational experiment and practice. It is 
unnecessary for us apologetically to defend our subject of study, 
since the general public sees the value of professional training, 
the teachers feel. the need of it, and the pupils are beginning to 
show tangible results. Education at present is an aggressive, 
developing subject for careful study and research, which has 
come to stay. The immediate important questions are: How 
may we aid its progress along scholarly, scientific and practical 
lines? How may we intelligently experiment with the vast 
resources at our command? 
Last year there were 196 public normals schools, 68 private 
normal schools, and 171 colleges and universities giving pro- 
fessional courses in education. Our normal schools were 
created early in the last century in response to a very urgent 
need for better teaching in the elementary schools; today the 
colleges and universities are beginning to feel their respon- 
sibility and opportunity in the training of teachers also. That 
these higher institutions are attacking their share of the work 
along practical and scientific lines is demonstrated by the fact 
that over forty colleges and universities are giving from five to 
forty weeks of practice teaching under supervision and direc- 
tion, and twelve of these institutions have model practice and 
experimental schools under their immediate direction and con- 
trol. The aim before the best schools of education today is 
preparation through intelligent participation. That our work 
is progressing along scientific lines is evidenced by recent maga-

                       zine articles and monographs, the papers at our meetings of 
the College Teachers of Education, the discussions before sec- 
tion L of the American Association for the Advancement of 
Science, the year book of the National Society for the Study of 
Education, and some of the departments of the National Edu- 
cation Association. 
In reviewing the work of the departments of education in 
colleges and universities, we find their aims differ in a manner 
interestingly significant. The predominance of emphasis dif- 
fers. Though all aim primarily to prepare more efficient 
teachers and to help formulate into accessible sources the vast 
amount of educational and psychological data now available 
from individual studies, monographic and historical literature, 
original research, and the numerous forms of experimentation 
and empirical observation. At Leland Standford, Jr., Univer- 
sity the director states their work aims in the main toward the 
preparation of educational leaders and contributive scholar- 
ship. At Iowa, the head of the school maintains “it is just as 
important to give students training in education because they 
are to be fathers and mothers as because they are to be teach- 
ers ;” at Bowdoin, the professor holds that the courses in edu- 
cation can be made to develop the student mentally in a man- 
ner similar to his physical development when under the direc- 
tion of a physical trainer; Smith and Wellesley stress the cul- 
tural aspects of the subject; Harvard has a large class com- 
posed of business men; and Brown emphasizes the practical 
phases by requiring one full year of practice teaching before 
granting its teacher’s diploma. Practically all institutions are 
extending and differentiating their courses, and I have been un- 
able to find a single college or university that has recently 
abandoned its courses in education. The Teachers’ College at 
Columbia, and the School of Education at Chicago, have be- 
come great universities in themselves, each giving over 100 
courses in educational theory and practice with intricately 
complex aims and methods of procedure. The former has over 
3,000 students enrolled in its educational courses. And it is 
generally conceded that the phenomenal growth of Columbia 
and Chicago Universities is due directly to the work of the 
teachers colleges. 
What are we doing in our great State universities, which
-P-A-G-E-574
  572 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
represent the most comprehensive, useful and democratic in- 
stitutions of learning in the world? In the United States there 
are at present forty-one State universities, and a number of 
State colleges which in a measure take the place of the univer- 
sity. Of the State universities, thirty-nine give regular courses 
in education, over one-half of these require practice teaching, 
and eight have model and experimental practice schools under 
their immediate direction and control. The first school of edu- 
cation to be established in a State university on a par with the 
others schools of law, medicine and engineering, was organized 
at Missouri in 1903. Since then similar schools have been es- 
tablished in Illinois,.Texas and North Dakota (1905), Minne- 
sota (1905), Iowa and Indiana (1907), Nebraska, Kentucky, 
Georgia and Colorado (1908), Vermont (1909), and Kansas 
(1910). The university normal school at Utah was established 
earlier. In some of these institutions there are more students 
enrolled in education than in law, medicine, engineering or the 
regular academic department. 
These schools of education, like those previously mentioned, 
have characteristic aims and functions. It remains to point out 
some of these functions. We may, for our purpose, divide the 
work of a State university school of education into the external 
and fortuitous functions and the internal activities of the 
school itself, the functions of course being inseparable except 
for cases of analysis. Since we are in State universities we 
are under obligations to those who support them, and not to 
a select few. Many of our people would gladly come to us if 
this were possible, but since it is frequently impossible we must 
take our work and training to the people. Our rate of develop- 
ment will be in direct proportion to the rate of progress of 
the great State public school system of which we are an integral 
part. 
There are at least three ways in which we may effectively 
extend the work of our departments over the State. In the 
first place, much may be effectively accomplished through bulle- 
tins and monographs to the people on such topics as school 
buildings, school hygiene, reference books, methods of teaching 
special subjects, laboratory equipment, etc. Another means, 
which we are trying on a small scale at Texas, is to distribute 
throughout the State small circulating libraries on the pro-
-P-A-G-E-575
  JOURNAL OF FO IGS: 573 
fessional training of teachers. This work is capable of 
elaborate expansion and effective application. Circulating 
exhibits similar to the child welfare exhibits may also very 
probably supplement this kind of work. 
Secondly, we may send members of our staff to the people 
and not for spasmodic educational lectures, but for regular 
university courses. This could be done by selecting two or 
three centers and having an instructor in education give regular 
courses with university credit at each, on alternate days; so 
far this plan has not been worked out by any State university 
department of education as far as I know. The school of edu- 
cation should also send out trained instructors to visit, inspect 
and help the rural schools and to learn the needs of the com- 
munity. A few instructors could be sent out as critic teachers 
on methods of teaching; others, to organize educational con- 
ferences; others, to train superintendents how to make intelli- 
gent reports to the State department and to the United States 
Bureau of Education; and others, to act as competent judges 
for evaluating a school system in a manner similar to the work 
that is now being done in New York City by professors of 
education who have been trained along this line. We must in- 
fuse the spirit of investigation and research through contagious 
methods and help older teachers in the service to regain their 
mental plasticity. 
In the third place, the school of education can frequently 
bring the teachers and superintendents to the university for 
educational conferences. Our departments should always be 
educational centers for free and liberal consultation, and a 
place where every school man in the State will feel free to 
come for help in school problems. As to the internal and 
specific functions, the school of education should be a center 
that consciously aims to unify and correlate all the educational 
forces and activities in the university bearing directly on the 
professional training of teachers and superintendents from the 
kindergarten to the college inclusive. It should, above all, be 
a center for the professional and academic training of teachers 
—high school teachers, superintendents, normal school teachers, 
and college teachers of education in particular. Productive 
scholarship and good teaching cannot be divorced. Of the 
21,277 teachers in Texas, about two-thirds have never had an

  574 SOUTHHRN HDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
education beyond a four-year high school, and many others have 
attended a normal school or college for only one year. A more 
thorough and adequate preparation should be insisted upon 
before young and inexperienced persons are permitted to as- 
sume the responsibilities of teachers. The truth is sacred, and 
it is a crime to place untrained boys and girls in our schools 
as leaders and teachers. An untruth consciously or uncon- 
sciously taught a growing child frequently cannot be corrected 
for years, and if partially corrected leaves behind a poisoned 
prejudice against the truth, which may cause a biased view- 
point throughout a lifetime. During the past five years the 
Department of Education at Texas has sent out over 1,000 
teachers to train a portion of the State’s 82,953 high school 
pupils and some of its elementary school pupils. 
The work of the school of education in universities is too 
comprehensive to discuss in all its phases in this paper. It re- 
mains to call attention to some of the phases of work in the 
Jniversity of Texas which are applicable in any State univer- 
sity. Our work consists of experimental and theoretical courses 
in educational psychology, history of education, philosophy of 
education, school management, school supervision and adminis- 
tration, principles and methods of teaching, educational prac- 
tice and experimental education. It is the work in educational 
practice and in experimental education that I wish to em- 
phasize in this paper, since this work falls within the field of 
my own school. It is along this line the development most 
needed is most rapidly taking place in ‘the better institutions, 
for a well-balanced department now parallels its theoretical 
courses with experiment and practice. 
One of the most important functions of our school of educa- 
tion in State universities, as has been stated, is to bring its 
work into closest contact with its public schools. This may be 
effectively done through observation and practice teaching and 
experimental education; these phases of our work will be 
treated successively. Our method at Texas is to parallel obser- 
vation and lectures during a portion of the fall and winter 
terms of the senior year, and to confine practice teaching to 
about half the university term. This year for the first time we 
are offering observation and practice work in some of the rural 
schools to elementary students. With the exception of a few
-P-A-G-E-577
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 575 
normal schools, like Kirksville at Kalamazoo, the rural schools, 
which constitute the majority of schools in our States, prac- 
tically have been ignored by training schools for teachers. In 
nearly all instances the training has been away from the coun- 
try school rather than toward it. It is one of our unrecognized 
functions to help these schools. 
Experience leads us to believe that the observation work 
may be made a very profitable means in education, since it 
carries the psychology and principles of education into the 
school-room and tests their applicability, the observations be- 
ing just as scientific as the observer’s training and opportunity 
permit. Our students are furnished with outlines, guides and 
syllabi of directions on the various phases of physical and 
mental development, individual differences, school hygiene, dis- 
cipline, methods of the recitation, and methods of teaching in 
the various school subjects. One type of outline is as follows:

or discussion and references see the writer’s syllabus, chap. XXIX.) 
(a) Name of observer; (b) name of school; (c) ‘grade; (d) subject; 
(e) size of class; (f) time of day; (g) date; (h) purpose of the 
visit. (For direct observations, general and individual, based on con- 
secutive visits. 
A. Signs of Fatigue. 
1. Among the physical signs of fatigue are restlessnes, bad posture, 
depressed appearance, poor muscular coédrdination, sluggish bodily re- 
sponse, twitchings. Verify or disprove any or all of these through 
direct observation and add four additional physical signs. 
2. Among the mental indications of fatigue are irritability, inatten- 
tion, inaccuracy of work, impaired judgment, irrevelant ideas. Verify 
or disprove as far as direct observation will permit these signs, and 
add two other mental signs. 
B. Causes of Fatigue. 
1. Which of the following would you consider the most prevalent 
causes of fatigue among the children observed and examined? Too 
much worry, fear of teachers, ineffective and unskillful method of 
work, unnatural positions, too much work out of school, lack of recrea- 
tion, monotony of work? Which of these are due to the school, to 
the teacher, to the pupil? Observe for other causes. 
C. Degrees of Fatigue. 
1. Try to distinguish between fatigue and weariness. 
2. Show through direct observation that fatigue varies at different 
times of the day: with different days of the week; with different 
types of pupils.

8. List according to fatigue effect the subjects you have observed be- 
ing taught in the school-room. 
D. Means of Removing Fatigue. 
1. May fatigue in one subject be relieved by work in another? 
Give reasons for your conclusions.. 
2. What means were used in this school to relieve fatigue—games, 
physical exercise, etc? 
3. Are there rest pauses besides intermissions in this school? What 
are the effects? Be specific in your answers. 
4. If possible, observe in a school where there is one session and in 
another where there are two; can you note any differences in degree 
of fatigue? If so, what are they? 
This is given merely as a type outline. 
We have found it best to have the questions and topics sug- 
gested for observation cover a comprehensive field in order to 
offer various lines of approach to the fundamental problems 
at hand, and to meet the needs of students whose opportunities 
for observation differ. Some are adapted for personal observa- 
tion and inspection of individuals; others for observation on 
group; some for one visit; and others for consecutive visits. 
The aim is to break up the complex school room situation into 
more simple factors that may be apperceived and studied suc- 
cessively. The analyses are made for purposes of description 
and study, but the reconstruction of the total school room 
situation is of paramount importance to the young training 
teacher, whose later function will be directing the psychological 
and educative processes rather than analyzing them. Oral re- 
ports, unless based on the original records taken at the time 
of the observation, are not to be encouraged, since the record- 
ing of definitely observed facts, the writing of a report, the 
organization of the material and the formulation of the obser- 
vations into tangible form for future reference and study, is 
a most valuable part of such work. It requires much training 
and practice to grasp the relative significance of the main 
factor in a complex school room situation, but the difficulties 
will disappear in proportion to our gain in organized laboratory 
methods and technique for dealing with educative process in 
action. 
As stated, the observation, practice work and experiments 
are being extended to all courses of my department. The prac- 
tice teaching is required of all senior students who are can-

didates for the teacher’s diploma who have not been excused on 
account of previous experience. At present there are thirty- 
two students in this class. These students practice in the pub- 
lic and private schools of Austin under direction and super- 
vision, and the practical phases of the work appeal to them, 
though it requires a great deal of time. This type of work 
furnishes teachers who have made a start in teaching and will 
help to save the high schools of Texas from being sacrificed as 
training and practice schools for inexperienced teachers. It 
permits us to test our students before sending them out; it 
helps to keep the department in touch with all the practical 
phases and difficulties of the profession by carry its training 
to a finish before the students leave the university. It helps 
to give the student independence, confidence and self-respect, 
and prevents many humiliating failures by enabling the train- 
ing-teachers to enter their chosen profession with an increased 
knowledge of the educational significance of their subject and 
its methods of presentation. 
These training-teachers are required to prepare lesson plans 
for each day’s work and submit them to the professor in charge 
of the course and to the critic teacher. At first, detail plans, 
outlining both subject-matter and method are required, but 
later the better students are excused from detailed written 
plans. All accepted and rejected plans are reserved and 
evaluated at the end of the term. The students are given 
specific directions on how to make lesson plans; their uses and 
abuses are discussed; and then the subject-matter which has 
been outlined is broken up into lesson units, which may require 
from one to five recitations. The method outline, which 
parallels the outline of subject-matter, expresses more ex- 
plicitly the method of carrying out the recitation. The appli- 
cation of the deductive, inductive, or informal method, is ex- 
plained in this outline as well as the presuppositions that have 
been accepted in regard to the pupil’s knowledge. 
Aside from the lectures, conferences and visits by the director 
and critic teachers, reports are required from the regular 
teacher in charge of the room in the public school. These re- 
ports are based on a suggestive outline, one of which is as 
follows:

Personal Qualifications of the Training-Teacher.—Interest in and 
appreciation of the work of the school? Personal fitness, i, ¢, sym-

Punctual? Neat? Accurate? Alert? Enthusiastic? 
Preparation of the Lesson by the Training-Teacher—Clearness of 
aim? Knowledge of subject-matter? Organization of lesson plans?

activity? Skill in giving constructive criticisms which lead to better 
achievement? 
Assignment of the Lesson by the Training-Teacher—Assignments 
definite and adapted to the pupil’s development? Difficulties of the 
next lesson anticipated and explained? Proper incentives given? 
Pupils directed how to study this particular lesson? 
Discipline Under the Direction of the Training-Teacher.—Ability te 
maintain order, and to develop among the pupils habits of self-control, 
self-direction and respect for the rights of others? General qualifica- 
tions as a disciplinariam? Ability to economize time and effort, and 
to secure prompt attention and obedience? 
General Rating of the Training-Teacher—Good? WBxcellent? Aver- 
age? Inferior? Failure? 
(The critic teacher uses a more detailed outline which is printed in 
the form of a score card.) 
There are, on the other hand, in many universities, certain 
conditions and difficulties which militate severely against this 
type of work. In the first place, it frequently occurs in dif- 
ferent city school systems that some of the regular teachers do 
not have the necessary qualifications to make a good report on 
the training-teacher; others do not care to have the student; 
and still others do not offer the proper standards for the 
students. Opportunities for demonstration and experimenta- 
tion are always very limited, because of lack of control on the 
part of the university department. 
The most urgent need in all schools of education in State 
universities is for model, practice and experimental schools 
under immediate control and direction, but carried on in 
codperation with the city schools of the community. The nor- 
mal schools have shown the universities what can be done in 
this direction, and they far excell us in equipment and organi- 
zation. There are nine State universities that have such schools 
 
-P-A-G-E-581
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 579 
—Arkansas, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North 
Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming. Four of these in- 
clude primary work. In only one case, where the State normal 
school has been included as part of the school of education, 
does the total cost of building and equipment exceed $100,000. 
Practically all are make-shifts of old academies, which were 
forced to do something or go out of business. In our reports 
from all State universities in this country there is a general 
expression of regret at not having first-class model schools. 
Commissioner Claxton, writing from Tennessee, said: “We 
have no practice and experimental school, which I consider 
very unfortunate.” Others wrote, “It is much to our discredit 
that we have no such school.” 
The University of Wisconsin has just received $150,000 from 
the State for the erection of a model school, and the University 
of Texas is planning to organize such a school in the near 
future. We believe that it can be made the chief means of 
connecting theory and practice, the center around which the 
activities of the Department of Education can be correlated, 
and one of the strongest connecting links between the univer- 
sity and the public schools of the State. It will offer oppor- 
tunities for educational research, the testing of educational 
theores and imethods, and the accumulation of statistics for the 
science of education. It will give us opportunity to study our 
problems through several consecutive years and will enable us 
to follow our methods with counter or check tests. It will be a 
laboratory for the Department of Education.* 
The most important function for a university school of edu- 
cation at the present time is to stimulate and direct original re- 
search in the field of education. It is here that we have a great 
opportunity to give our schools immediate help. It is also a 
practical phase of education, which, when pursued under stand- 
ardized conditions and directions, will be of greatest value to 
the science of education in its present phase of development. 
The University of Texas is putting forth some effort in this 
direction in its schools of philosophy of education, history of 
education, school administration, and educational practice. 
Though our other schools are doing as much as or more than

the school which I direct, I shall limit this discussion again to 
the school of educational practice, on account of my being 
familiar with its details. There are ten graduate students and 
twenty other advanced students in this school who are making 
scientific studies, based on actual observation and experimenta- 
tion to be carried through a series of consecutive weeks, months, 
or years on such problems as elimination and retardation in 
the ward and high schools of Austin, where the same pupils are 
being followed throughout their scholastic life of eleven years. 
Some other problems are: The practical testing of the honor- 
system in the high school and university; school grades; the 
study program in the elementary and high schools; the univer- 
sity laggard, where 500 college students are being followed 
through their academic period from three to six years; the in- 
fluence of late entrance on university standing, where another 
group of 350 students are being studied individually throughout 
their college course; the teaching of special branches of learn- 
ing in the high school, including science, English, mathematics, 
etc. Other investigations are centering around the physical, 
mental and moral development of adolescents. In this work 
consecutive reports are emphasized rather than questionnaire 
methods and group reports. We shall be glad to send our 
record blanks and cards to those interested in this type of 
work. This type of experimental education work requires in- 
telligent codperation on the part of our school men. 
I have confined this discussion to some of the practical and 
expermiental phases of our work in the State university schools 
of education. By this kind of work, and in connection with 
the other courses, we can help the State by sending out better 
teachers, and thus aid in the elimination of some of the waste 
from inefficient teaching ; we can extend our work more directly 
to the people along the lines indicated; we can be potent forces 
in correlating and unifying the various phases of the State 
public school system of which the university is the capstone; 
we can help to test the efficiency of the public school by furnish- 
ing the school men definite guides and means of measurements 
for the evaluation of school work; we can make our work more 
scientific and practical by emphasizing observation, practice 
teaching and experimental education; we can be the center for 
educational research for studying the problems of our public
-P-A-G-E-583
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 581 
schools; we can furnish our commonwealth with men and 
women teachers who can project an educational ideal into a 
community and who are trained in methods of helping people 
to reach such ideals. We can help to create local pride, local 
enthusiasm, and local coéperation which is especially needed 
in Texas, which has a permanent endowment of over $70,000,000 
and the foundation of the greatest public school system in the 
United States. 
These are some of the important functions which a school of 
education can serve in helping to answer the questions, “How 
may we aid education’s progress along scientific, scholarly and 
practical lines? And how may we experiment with the vast re- 
sources at our command?” 
THE PREPARATION OF THE TEACHERS OF AGRICUL- 
TURE FOR THE CHILDREN OF THE 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
W. A. LEWIS, KIRKSVILLE, MO. 
The first great step in the progress of American agriculture 
was the vitalizing of the plans and labors of the early students 
of agriculture into experiment stations. The way was new and 
many mistakes were made. The cautious student of science 
was very careful of his prophecies and the bulletins that were 
issued gradually became the messenger of better farming to a 
steadily growing audience of sincere and earnest men and 
women, the real sinews of America. The painstaking men and 
women in the colleges of agriculture and experiment stations 
reached and filled the real need in American life. 
Then it became popular to be connected with the work of up- 
lift, and the limelight seeker, quick to detect this growing popu- 
larity, loaded himself with facts and fancies and raced up and 
down our land preaching data that was largely worthless. 
Then came Roosevelt’s Rural Life Commission, and again these 
notoriety seekers had a new field for their endeavor; and our 
country was listening to high-flown theories of fanciful ways 
and means that could not be brought into existence. Rural 
life faddists are even now running up and down our country, 
some wanting us to revolve about a small school and church for 
a center, and others talking and shouting for the good old 
happy days. This class of sensational agitators is, in my 
mind, not only worthless, but detrimental to real progress. 
 
-P-A-G-E-584
  582 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Our new life and ideas are too big to be confined to commu- 
nity interests, and least of all will it be possible to European- 
ise our American farmer. The independent spirit of the 
American farmer is the best possible argument why it will 
always be impossible to have a spiritualized, fossilized bit of 
humanity, localized in a minute orbit, and to make him 
believe he is living a full human life. We have now reached 
the stage where it is necessary to develop the world citizen 
It is the individual we are working for. The greatest power 
and civilization of the old world fell because the individual 
was subject to the state. I believe that we now all agree that 
America’s hope for the future lies in the fact that we are de- 
veloping the individual for the individual, and the State as 
his servant. 
The history of the world shows us that when the church 
was the leader of the community, progress was very slow; 
and I believe the arguments go to show that the church is now 
fully a quarter of a century behind the material advancement 
of the people, and consequently it cannot be the center of the 
community. Man refuses to be limited to the community in 
which he lives. He demands the right to go twenty or thirty 
miles in his automobile to hear a good sermon or see a good 
play. He reserves the right to go this distance to seek 
congenial associates. The day is not far distant when 
good roads will be quite common. If they never be- 
come so, it is beyond the range of possibility that the aver- 
age man may some day be able to solve the good roads problem 
by a stroke and fly to his destination? It will not be long 
until distance will be no barrier. Man will soon be almost 
as free as the bird and his wings almost as swift. I for one 
do not want to see the little weazened chap, whose horizon is 
no larger than the country parish. How can you get great 
ideas into small lives? : 
After the strife and smoke of battle always comes the stu- 
dent, calm and evenly poised, and solves the problem. He al- 
ways will do so. The student in the agricultural college and 
on the farm will be the real molders of America’s greatest and 
most vital industry. You cannot ferment cider from without 
the barrel. The enzyme must be in the cider. Likewise you 
cannot show me where in our world’s history a man ever be-
-P-A-G-E-585
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 583 
came a leader by fault-finding, and by shouting from a pedestal 
to the multitude, “Come up higher with me.” Those who 
have done things used examples and not words. The old-time 
bombast and oratory have passed away, and common-sense 
demonstration has taken their place. The day of the organ- 
izer and worker is here. 
I believe Garfield’s statement is correct, that “At the head 
of all the sciences and arts, at the head of civilization and 
progress stands not militarism, the science that kills; not 
commerce, the art that accumulates wealth, but agriculture, 
the mother of all industry and the maintainer of human 
life.” The term “agriculture is a broad one and its mantle 
covers much more of human life than the tillage of the soil 
and the raising of grain and animals. Agriculture touches 
the life of the husbandman in all his material activities, from 
the cradle to the grave. 
The colleges of agriculture are now taking the stand that 
helping in the labor of the farm is not their only work. They 
claim it takes probably as much training to dispose of the 
yearly surplus to a high advantage as it does to produce it. 
The college claims the leadership in the twofold function of 
production and disposition of the fruits of toil. The more 
ambitious colleges claim the function of advisors to the home 
and of its equipment, and are teaching laws and facts of hy- 
giene and correct physical living. They go still farther and 
claim they are derelict in their duty if they do not help us 
build our houses for the greatest efficiency and usefulness, and 
stand as a guide in the purity and wholesomeness of our food. 
The colleges and departments of agriculture claim the right 
of materially helping mankind in the business of farming, of 
house and barn building, in proper sanitary conditions around 
the house, in the elimination of pathogenic bacteria and the 
agencies for their propagation, in proper preparation of foods, 
in preserving of fruits and meats, and in the best methods of 
making the home life beautiful and clean. Therefore the 
teacher of agriculture in our public schools must teach some- 
thing besides sprouting grains and naming parts of plants. 
At this point I want to digress enough to point out what I 
believe to be the great possibility of the teachers in the de- 
partments of history and literature, in the creating of a re-  
-P-A-G-E-586
  584 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
ceptive and appreciative attitude on the part of the student 
for agriculture. I suppose I am treading on thin ice when I 
say history teaching is not for the acquisition of data, of in- 
cidents and revolutions. I believe the prime function of his- 
tory is to prepare the boy and girl to be better interpreters 
of present life by having lived, with the aid of history, through 
the evolution of the world. History that does not serve some 
present life function is as useless for building material as is 
a rotten log. President Roosevelt appointed a commission to 
discover why the boy leaves the farm. This commission found 
various reasons. I can tell you why I left the farm. It was 
not because of hard work or lack of social enjoyments and 
amusements. I left because I was taught that in the cities 
were real life and vital things. I never read of a single thing 
worth while of farm life. My history never taught me any- 
thing about the farm. I believe character and habit and fu- 
ture life depends largely on the musings of the boy or girl. 
I read of the pilgrim fathers and their frozen toes, and their 
fights with Indians and their turkey thanksgiving. I did not 
read a single line of how the Indians killed weeds by burning 
over the ground and planted fish bones with the corn as a 
fertilizer. That was too trifling a matter; “frozen toes” was 
of more importance. I can find reams of literature about 
“frozen toes ;” two months ago I had to search diligently in an 
exhaustive library for a few lines about weed destruction and 
the use of fish bones. As a boy I never read of the meeting 
between Lysander, the Spartan admiral, and Cyrus of Sardis. 
The story goes: Cyrus was showing Lyander through his gar- 
dens, when the great Spartan exclaimed: “Cyrus, I congratu- 
late you upon your superior landscape gardener.” “I, myself, 
was the landscape gardener,” replied Cyrus. “Impossible!” 
exclaimed the great sea captain. “How could you do so rare 
a piece of work?” Cyrus made reply: “I find that gardening 
is beneficial exercise before meat and wine!’ The whole 
story is quite effective and would create a new notion in a 
child’s mind as to the qualifications of a workman in those 
days, and that it was almost an unbelievable feat for a great 
officer to be able to plant a garden successfully. It seems to 
me you are by this story adding a note of dignity to labor. 
You claim such history as this will not produce the culture
-P-A-G-E-587
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 585 
and refinement that stories of politics and of State will? 
You say we must have cultured gentlemen and ladies and not 
raise young America as a class of business boars. For your 
young man of culture and refinement, I refer you to the citi- 
zenship of Athens when Athens was in her glory of sculpture 
and architecture, and call your attention to the fact that the 
people were living their lives in filth, and the men were afraid 
to be out on the street after night for fear they would fall in 
a cesspool in front of some neighbor’s doorstep. Did culture 
here make a clean and decent citizenship? For the authority 
of my statement of this condition of Athens, I refer you to 
Dr. Gullick, of Harvard University. The Romans were great 
in war and law. Johnston, of Indiana University, tells of 
them, that they used emetics at the banquet board so they 
could prolong their gluttony and whetted their appetites by 
piquant sauces. Did great learning in affairs of state make 
the clean and decent man? I hardly think the student of his- 
tory, as it is now taught, gets these pictures. I know it is 
claimed we ought not to bring up such subjects. Does the 
truth hurt? Is it undesirable to be honest? 
Again, why not study the problem of Egyptian irrigation as 
well as the pyramids. They were both engineering feats of 
consequence. Do you not suppose we could understand their 
religion a little better if we were familiar with the animal hus- 
bandry of Egypt? Every boy and girl would have a higher 
regard for ancient civilization and Arabia, if they could study 
the beautiful Arabian horse, developed centuries before Christ 
by the Bedouins of the desert. Why cannot the teacher of 
literature have me read how Anaximander of Miletus, 610 
B.C., thought that animals were formed from moisture; and 
how Aristotle, 384 B.C., believed that animals sprang from 
putrifying soil and growing plants; and how Ovid believed 
that life was spontaneous; and of Virgil, how carefully he 
gave directions for the artificial production of bees. Why 
cannot I learn about the beliefs of the ancient people in place 
of “Jack, the Giant Killer” or “Reynard, the Fox?” Why 
cannot I know with profit that even in the sixteenth century 
people believed that you could mix mud and sticks and water 
and artificially manufacture mice and other animals? 
Why cannot I learn real life that is stranger and stronger

  586 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
than fiction? As a boy on the farm following the plow, do 
you not think these things would be quite as attractive to me 
as imaginary great opportunities in the city, with which our 
readers and books are filled? Do you not think that if I could 
know of old Egypt and her herders when I drive the cows in 
from the pasture, I should appreciate my opportunities? I 
rather think I should. In my mind this is the real reason 
why so many leave the farm. It was the reason I left. It is 
not the reason I expect to go back some day. 
Now, then, as an agriculture teacher, if I could have the 
help from the history and literature, my work would be stren- 
uous, but enjoyable. I believe the teacher of agriculture in 
the public schools should be as proficient in the art of agricul- 
ture as in the science. The preparation should be a very sys- 
tematic one, because of so many enticing byways that may 
lead to minor things. The preparation should be compre- 
hensive rather than exhaustive. One of America’s greatest 
colleges of agriculture is now giving a teachers’ course. The 
greatest students of this subject are slowly acknowledging 
the fact that it is not the exhaustive knowledge the student 
may possess which gives him a special fitness for teaching. 
They are now taking the view that it is rather more of the 
kind of working knowledge than detailed facts. Not having 
the codperation of the history and English teachers as I have 
suggested, I want the prospective public school teacher to 
have a course in the history of the development of agriculture 
and science. Nothing so prepares the mind for work as a 
thorough understanding of his surroundings at the beginning. 
You can understand the grain-binder much better by knowing 
the development from the Egyptian grain hook to our present 
self-binder. 
After the student is familiar with the rounding into con- 
crete form of our modern farm business, then I should start 
him to work on the subject of farm crops. Here he has a 
chance for quite intensive study of the science of farming in 
his particular section of the country. He ought to study 
enough of the crops of the other sections of America to make 
him an intelligent citizen. In the subject of crop rotation, we 
reach our first need of the subject of botany. Here is a real 
need. The nature of the grain plant, its structure and habits,
-P-A-G-E-589
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 587 
are now of vital importance. Weeds and their habits and 
means or eradication make a knowledge of botany essential. 
The student has created his own demand for botany, and in- 
stead of the proverbial objection to the subject, there is real 
joy in the study. I believe it is because the student has cre- 
ated the need for the subject and now understands its worth. 
The only botany I should give is with the work in farm crops. 
Right here I wish to state that no school or department of 
agriculture can do effective work in the art side of the sub- 
ject unless a demonstration farm is owned and operated by 
the department. A school garden is all right in its place, but 
a garden cannot be a farm. 
In farm crops, we get the selling values, the feeding values, 
the need of crop rotation for continuous food supply, and for 
maintaining and increasing the soil fertility. The work 
naturally leads us into the study of soils. Now we are where 
the real school farm serves its chief function. Here the stu- 
dent becomes more than the scientist. Here he becomes the 
practical farmer. It is now the time to apply theories and 
facts about crop rotations and soil management learned from 
the text-book. On the school farm is where the teacher 
bridges the chasm that has separated him from the farmer and 
planter. In my own classes last summer, in which there were 
180 Missouri public school teachers, ranging in age from 18 
to 40 years, I found the greatest zest and enthusiasm on the 
days we spent on the school farm. I never found the ther- 
mometer registering too high to spoil the pleasure and profit 
of a trip, even when it was registering 95. 
The school farm is now the effective text-book to present the 
actual problems involved in crop rotation for the purposes of 
both maintaining soil fertility and giving the farm a balanced 
food supply. This is the real art of agriculture. The science 
is here, but it is now the working foundation for the applica- 
tion of the art. Last summer the public school teachers in at- 
tendance at our school saw four of their fellow-students bring 
a crop of corn through a prolonged drought, one of the worst 
. in the history of Missouri. These same four boys were simply 
following methods worked out by experiment stations. These 
boys were so successful that they only had one-half dozen 
blanched tops in twenty acres of corn. Do you think these
-P-A-G-E-590
  588 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
people cannot talk intelligently with any farmer on the sub- 
ject of maintaining moisture in the soil? Horticulture and 
poultry are side-line industries in our part of the country and 
are treated as such in our farm work. 
I should next want to develop the animal husbandry side of 
farming. Here we can study the animals, types and breeds, 
and farm values, and the comparative profits to the farmer. 
As an illustration, we are now feeding eighty-seven head of 
Arizona lambs on the school farm, for the twofold purpose of 
making money and learning the sheep business. We bor- 
rowed the money from a bank, as the average farmer would 
do, and we shall pay off our note when due by the sale of the 
sheep. We hope to make a money profit; we know we have 
already made our knowledge profit. Here is then a proper 
place for dairying. We know crops and how to produce them. 
We know domestic animals and have discussed their relative 
value to the farmer. We have determined the actual value of 
hogs and sheep; we next go to the dairy cows. This again 
takes us to the farm. What a useful laboratory is the farm in 
this busy preparation of the future teacher! We are here 
working with the living, vital problem of dairying. The stu- 
dents feed the cows, milk them, test the milk, study and watch 
their cow, compare notes with other students, and learn from 
first hand the art of dairying. The text-book is used to keep 
the student balanced and to prevent him from coming to wild 
and unwarranted conclusions. Here our future teacher 
learns by touch, sight, work, and study the problems of herd 
selection, individual selection, feeds and feeding for milk, milk 
production, butter production, health of the cows, value of 
sanitary quarters, and the whole of the actual business of 
running a small dairy farm. 
Our study of dairying properly brings up the subject of 
sanitation, and I should want the student to add to his work 
a course in sanitation. The present knowledge of bacteria 
has opened up a new world to us, and it is our own fault if we 
walk into dangers blindly. We can now fight disease intelli- 
gently. We can avoid it. Tuberculosis and typhoid fever are 
two preventable diseases that come in close touch with foods 
and living. They are in close relation to dairying. I believe 
a student of agriculture is a better citizen and public school
-P-A-G-E-591
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 589 
teacher if he understands sanitary house construction, proper 
sewage disposal, pure water supply, and the problems relating 
to infectious diseases that exact such a heavy toll from the 
children of men. Where is a better place to teach this lesson 
than in a well-conducted dairy? 
Doctors have for years been trying to teach the doctrine of 
the square deal in sanitation. They have never succeeded to 
a very great extent. The teacher must take up the fight if 
it is to prosper. The children in the grades are the most 
eager for the knowledge of this new world of benign and path- 
ogenic bacteria. I learned from actual experience of teaching 
them that children grasp the modern idea of disease and fair 
play in correct living, and apply them more readily than do 
grown people. The children only lack the ability to systema- 
tize and retain scientific terms. 
Now, then, here we have the public school teacher of agri- 
culture: Classroom training in the science of farm crops, in 
soil management, in animal husbandry, in sanitation, in farm 
machinery and architecture, and, best and greatest of all, he 
is now more of a master in the arts of the husbandman be- 
cause his school has furnished him a farm where conditions 
were natural and practical. 
I believe you will all agree with me that the classroom- 
trained teacher cannot be the practical enthusiast that the 
classroom and farm-trained teacher is. The teacher of great- 
est usefulness is the one who can sit down with the boy or 
girl, man or woman, and plan the farm crops, discuss soil re- 
plenishing, values of types and breeds of farm animals, values 
in dairying, sanitary home making, clean and wholesome liv- 
ing, and make themselves a living, active, helpful part of the 
community. And last, I believe that it is the function of the 
department of agriculture in universities and normal schools 
to equip teachers with the practical spirit of better living, and 
not to fill them with the lore of the specialist, for the work of 
the public.school teacher of agriculture is in evolution and not 
revolution.

too cheerful—of struggles with the “Shorter Catechism.” The 
first question in this catechism some of you will recognize, 
“What is the chief end of man?” and the answer, “Man’s chief 
end is to glorify God and enjoy him forever.” In this formu- 
lation of their belief as to man’s proper relation to his Maker 
and his proper duties to his fellow-man, the Westminster di- 
vines who framed this confession of their faith wisely at- 
tempted at the outset of their task to settle the question of the 
purpose of man’s existence—“man’s chief end.” We have met 
at this hour to consider the subject, “The Proper Work of 
the Normal Schools.” As preliminary to this discussion it 
may be well for us, my fellow normal school workers—Meth- 
odists, Baptists, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, all—to adopt 
as the first question of our professional catechism the ques- 
tion, “What is the end or purpose of the normal school?” 
The answer to this question will in great measure decide the 
subsequent articles in the confession of our faith as to the 
proper work of the normal schools. 
I hold that there can be but one answer to this preliminary 
question. The purpose of the normal school is primarily to 
prepare competent teachers for the public schools; second- 
arily, to promote the efficiency of thesé schools in every possi- 
ble way. The fulfillment of this purpose is the sole reason 
for the existence of normal schools, the only justification for 
the expenditure of public money in their support. 
The normal school, then, is not a law school, a medical 
school, nor a theological seminary. It is not a business col- 
lege, nor an industrial academy. It is true that some normal 
school graduates eventually follow other callings than that of 
teaching; and it is also true that some normal school courses 
are not devoid of value as preparation in part for several vo- 
cations. But it must be remembered that any aid given to 
those expecting to follow other callings is merely incidental 
to the one great plan and aim of the normal school. Again, 
it is not the purpose of the normal school to serve as a pre- 
paratory school to other institutions—as a feeder to the uni- 
versities. While an esential part of the public school system, 
the normal school is not itself a round of the educational 
ladder. It stands to one side as a nourisher and strengthener 
of all phases of education, particularly those below the uni-

versity. The normal school should aim to instill into its 
students the spirit of the scholar, to fire them with ambition 
to attain the highest culture represented by a university edu- 
cation; yet university affiliation is not the goal of its ambi- 
tion, nor can it shape its courses or sacrifice its aim for this 
end, however desirable. Lastly, the purpose of the normal 
school is not to give a general education. It is not a high 
school or a college, with an incidental pedagogical attach- 
ment. True, some of its courses, so far as subject-matter is 
concerned, run parallel to the courses covered by the high 
school or college. Yet even in these courses, as will be indi- 
cated later in this paper, there is a marked distinction in 
spirit and in purpose between the normal school and other 
institutions. 
The proper work of normal schools can be stated only in 
general terms. There is no Procrustean rule presenting in 
identical terms the proper work for all institutions for teacher 
training. While all have a common aim, and while there is a 
similarity in their courses of study, absolute uniformity is 
neither possible nor desirable. The proper work of a New 
England normal school differs from the proper work of a 
Texas normal school. Even in the same State the proper 
work of any two such institutions may not be the same, al- 
though their requirements for certification and graduation 
may be equivalent. The comparative efficiency of the public 
schools in different sections, prevailing industrial and social 
conditions, the personnel of the faculty, local environment, 
financial support, are some of the factors that determine the 
proper work of any particular school. Individuality in 
schools is needed no less than individuality in pupils. “The 
letter killeth, the spirit maketh alive.’ What, then, does the 
proper work of the normal school include? 
1. An essential feature of the work of every normal school 
is the development in its students of the highest ideals of 
character and of service. “The end of education is the devel- 
opment of character, and the test of character is the rendition 
of service.” Character training is recognized as a necessary 
function of every school. Yet when we remember the all-per- 
vading and resistless power of the teacher’s personal influence, 
we must admit the supreme obligation of the normal school  
-P-A-G-E-594
  592 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
is to instill the highest standards of conduct. “The measure 
of a life is its service,” is the appropriate inscription upon a 
beautiful window in the chapel of the Sam Houston Normal 
Institute in loving memory of a great Texas teacher, Henry 
Carr Pritchett. The measure of any teacher is his recogni- 
tion of the obligation and privilege of service. “If meat 
make my brother to offend, I will eat no more meat while the 
world standeth,” was the noble declaration of the great apos- 
tle; it represents the spirit of consecrated service that must 
be inculcated by the normal school. 
2. It is an essential function of the normal school to mag- 
nify the office of teacher. It should send forth its graduates 
fired with a holy zeal in a splendid cause, inspired with a 
lofty ambition to achieve success in a profession that requires 
the fullest exercise of man’s noblest powers. There are too 
many schoolkeepers on the payrolls of the public schools— 
men and women with no joy in their work, no pride in their 
calling. The atmosphere of the normal school should be 
charged with a recognition of the infinite dignity and bound- 
less possibilities of the teacher’s vocation. Herein is an ad- 
vantage of the normal school over other institutions in which 
the training of teachers is an incident, and where the majority 
of the students have their thoughts and ambitions centered 
on other interests. With unsympathetic surroundings and 
unfavorable influences, the young teacher fails to get a valu- 
able element of his needed equipment. 
3. It is the function of the normal school to give academic 
instruction—scholarship, if you please. The teacher must 
know the subjects to be taught, he must know the pupil, and 
he must have professional knowledge. It is not possible for 
the normal school to escape the responsibility of verifying, 
testing, and deepening the scholarship of its students. This 
academic instruction must include a review of the elementary 
branches as well as study of advanced subjects. Its advanced 
courses may extend from two to four years beyond the high 
school. For two reasons academic instruction must be given 
in the normal school: (1) It is impossible to completely 
separate academic from professional instruction. The best 
way to teach principles and methods is in connection with 
subject-matter, whether reviewed or studied for the first time.
-P-A-G-E-595
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 593 
(2) Owing to the inadequate financial rewards of the teacher 
and the uncertain tenure of his position, the vocation of teach- 
ing possesses few attractions to a young person of scholarship 
and ability. If the normal school admitted only such stu- 
dents as possess ripe scholarship, its doors would be closed 
for lack of students, and the public schools would suffer in 
proportion from the diminished supply of teachers. Under 
present conditions it is needful to lure young people into the 
ranks of teachers, and this can be done in part by offering 
academic instruction in the normal schools. This academic 
instruction differs from that given in the high school and col- 
lege in that every subject in the normal school course is 
studied from the teacher’s standpoint. Thus every course in 
the curriculum becomes in some measure a_ professional 
course. 
4. It is a universally recognized function of the normal 
school to give professional instruction and training. These 
professional courses must include the study of both princi- 
ples and processes, theory and practice, science and art. The 
academic courses, as pursued in the normal school, have their 
professional value. Among the purely professional courses, 
psychology—elementary and applied—history of education, 
management and methods, educational principles, school ad- 
ministration, child study, are included in the theoretical part 
of the teacher’s professional education. Schools of observation 
and practice are needed to supplement the theoretical side 
and will eventually be provided in every normal school. 
5. The great majority of public school teachers are teachers 
of rural schools. The improvement of the country school is a 
problem now facing the leaders of educational thought in 
every State. Normal school courses should recognize and pro- 
vide for the peculiar difficulties of the rural school. The 
training of rural school teachers should be an important fea- 
ture of the work of every normal school. 
6. The proper work of the normal school includes the 
training of teachers for every department of the public schools. 
Of necessity, in the past, the activities of the normal school 
have been directed chiefly to the preparation of teachers for 
elementary and rural schools. But the time has come when 
the normal schools should be provided with such financial 
38 
 
-P-A-G-E-596
  594 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
support, such faculty, and such equipment as will enable them 
adequately to fit teachers for high school positions, for princi- 
pals, for supervisors, and for general educational leadership. 
With the rapid development of high schools in the South it is 
impossible for university departments of education to supply 
the demand for high school teachers. It is not here sug- 
gested that normal schools enter into competition with uni- 
versity departments of education. The training of teachers for 
the elementary and rural schools will continue to be the great 
field of the normal school; yet the preparation of high school 
teachers should be one phase of its work. Covering every 
phase of public school teaching, the proper work of the normal 
school includes the preparation of teachers for the kinder- 
garten, for the industrial arts, and for such special subjects 
as music, drawing, and the commercial branches. 
7. Lastly, the normal school should carry its inspiration 
and instruction beyond the limits of its classrooms and 
campus. It should promote educational progress by some 
systematic plan of extension work. Its faculty should be 
sanely progressive—leaders of educational thought and ac- 
tivity. They should not be so overburdened with class in- 
struction as to prevent original investigation. They should 
study actual educational conditions. They should maintain 
an attitude of helpful sympathy to the teachers in the field, 
and thus render a service to the State not inferior to the best 
classroom instruction. 
In conclusion: The normal school must recognize its own 
limitations. It must not seek to thrust its students into po- 
sitions they are unprepared to fill. It must stand for modesty 
in its claims, for thoroughness in its instruction, for sympa- 
thetic codperation with all other educational agencies. Thus 
fulfilling its proper functions, it will receive increasing sup- 
port from the people whom it serves. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES AND SUMMER SCHOOLS. 
C. W. DAUGETTE, JACKSONVILLE, ALA. 
For many years we have had in the different States of the 
Union what are known as teachers’ institutes, varying in 
length of time from two days to six weeks; some with several 
instructors, reaching the dignity of summer schools; others
-P-A-G-E-597
JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGS. 595 
with no instructors and amounting to mere teachers’ meetings. 
They have been known by different names: county institutes, 
district institutes, summer normals and summer schools. 
There seems to be a well-defined tendency to make the insti- 
tute of one week’s duration, with two or more instructors, 
thus differentiating the institute proper from the summer 
school, which is a more recent development. As the program 
calls for a round-table discussion at this time, the institute 
will be considered first, and distinctive summer schools, as 
such, can then be taken up if time permits. 
For Whom Held.—The institute exists primarily for the 
non-professional teacher; the normal school for the profes- 
sional teacher. When one enters upon an extended course of 
study in a normal school, it is to be presumed that he does so 
with the intention of pursuing teaching for a longer or shorter 
period of time, therefore he may be very properly classed as a 
professional teacher; but there is still a large percentage of 
our teachers who have never received any professional train- 
ing, and many of them totally inadequate academic training, 
and the institute is an effort on the part of the American peo- 
ple to secure at least a modicum of professional training for 
all their public school teachers. It is.a fact to be lamented— 
true, nevertheless—that our public school teaching force is 
not as persistent and lasting as it should be. There is a con- 
stant change. The women marry and the men quit to go into 
some other vocation, consequently there is a constant influx 
of young and inexperienced teachers from the public schools, 
many of them never having finished more than the seventh 
grade. Further than this, it is a well recognized fact that 
our teaching force is recruited largely from the rural dis- 
tricts and from the untutored classes of society. While the 
institute exists for all the teachers in the service it is ex- 
pected that the greatest good will accrue to this class of 
young teachers of every grade of development and widely vary- 
ing acquirements who happen to be entering the work. These 
teachers do not begin teaching with definite preparation for 
it and purpose to continue it as a profession, but usually for 
other reasons; therefore they may be classed as non-profes- 
sional, and it is for them that the institute primarily exists. 
It is expected, of course, that all teachers will receive pro-
-P-A-G-E-598
  596 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
fessional uplift, and it is one of the problems of those who 
have charge of institute work to prepare all classes of teachers 
who are expected to attend. 
Purpose.—1. The institute is a normal school with a very 
short course of study. It should not undertake to do the 
work of the normal school, but should supplement it; there- 
fore the chief function of the institute should be to create pro- 
fessional enthusiasm and inspiration, to cause every teacher 
enrolled to be filled with a desire to learn more of his work, 
so that he may be able to give better service and be a better 
teacher than ever before. These teachers should be stimulated 
to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by the State 
for continuing their professional studies beyond the simple 
beginning offered by the institute. The five days’ courses at 
the institute should focus the attention of the young teacher 
upon the necessity of his entering upon a longer course of 
preparation at a State normal school. 
2. It is the duty of the institute to communicate professional 
knowledge. This itself will contribute to the chief end in 
view, the inspiration of all present. By professional know]l- 
edge I mean, first, the purpose for which each subject in the 
public school course is taught, why it has its place in the 
public schools; secondly, the nature of the subject; thirdly, 
the methods of teaching it; fourthly, methods in the organiza- 
tion and government of the school, because a school must be 
organized before it is taught, and must be governed or disin- 
tegration will take place. Methods of grading must be con- 
sidered. The making of a daily program is highly important. 
These two subjects alone require a profound knowledge of 
pedagogy. School and home hygiene, proper lighting and 
ventilation, are-subjects of school management which must 
have attention. To illustrate: Take reading. Why is read- 
ing taught in schools? What is the problem to be solved by 
the primary teacher? What relationship has the new vocabu- 
lary to the one which the child already possesses? What are 
the best methods of teaching him the new? Which would you 
select and what is the basis of your selection? (After 
Payne,) Take geography. Why is geography taught? As 
it deals with the earth as the home of man, a large part of it 
is descriptive. It is, therefore, largely a text-book subject.
-P-A-G-E-599
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 597 
The globe is the unit, and as few, if any, can visit all parts of 
the globe, that part studied, that accessible to the pupil, should 
be used as the type of all those parts which cannot be visited. 
Take arithmetic. Why taught? Most prominently it enters 
into our daily lives in a most practical manner. We could 
not intelligently exchange commodities, keep records, make 
measurements, without a knowledge of it. It deals with the 
quantitative side of things. As it is not a memory subject 
it should not be taught by rule, but by practical measure- 
ments, combinations, divisions and subtractions, inductively. 
This line of work should be followed through the entire school 
curriculum, so the young teacher may view the subjects in 
their broader aspects. 
Limitations—1. Time. The usual length of the teachers’ 
institute is five days. It is, therefore, seen that whatever work 
is done must be highly condensed or must be inspirational in 
character, and must be such as will constitute a beginning 
which is so attractive and so impressive to the learner that he 
will follow it voluntarily after the institute closes. 
2. Another limitation of the institute is the unequal pro- 
ficiency of those who compose it. Usually all the teachers of 
the public schools are required to attend. This includes prin- 
cipals, superintendents and grade teachers in the city schools, 
and principals and assistants in the one to three-teacher rural 
and village schools. One of the great problems of the institute 
is to give such work as will generate interest, enthusiasm and 
inspiration on the part of all, and cause no loss of time nor 
waste on the part of any. Where the number of conductors 
will allow, it would seem best to divide the institute into sec- 
tions according to the acquirements, experience and capacity 
of those composing it, or according to the work they are en- 
gaged in. 
Methods—1. From the foregoing it is seen that no academic 
work should be attempted other than such as may be typical 
and such as constitutes the merest elements of the subjects, 
nor should the instruction be all theory and practice, but the 
inspiration should be anchored by definite, specific demonstra- 
tion and practical instruction in methods and management. 
Many a lawyer dates his determination to enter the law from 
the time he heard a great speech in a courthouse; many a
-P-A-G-E-600
  598 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
preacher dates his call to the ministry from the time he heard 
a soul-stirring sermon by a great preacher of the Gospel; many 
a physician began the study of medicine as the result of his 
admiration for some doctor whose skill he had seen evidence 
of. The young and inexperienced teacher may receive his high- 
est inspiration by seeing a lesson taught by a strong teacher in 
such way as to arouse to the highest degree his powers of in- 
telligence, thus eliciting his admiration and elevating what he 
considered commonplace to the realm of the highest art. 
2. The limitations cited above point to the lecture method 
as better than the class-room or recitation method in instruc- 
tion given in an institute, or to a combination of the two. The 
class-room method should, of course, be used in demonstration 
work. 
Problems.—The problems which are still engaging the atten- 
tion of institute workers are: 1. To what extent should the 
method of instruction follow the lecture plan, and to what ex- 
tent class-room methods? 2. Who should be institute conduc- 
tors? How may the public school teachers best be protected 
against inefficient instruction? Upon what basis should they 
be selected? By whom? 38. Should the teachers in the insti- 
tute be divided into grades? If so, upon what basis, experience, 
capacity, acquirements, grade of State certificate held, or upon 
the basis of work attempted, as primary, intermediate, higher, 
etc.? 4. Should all teachers be required to attend and be paid 
for attendance? If so, how? Should all be paid the same 
amount? Should any be paid more than expenses? The sub- 
ject is now open for discussion.

PHYSICAL EXERCISES AND ATHLETICS IN ‘THE 
GRADES: WHAT FORMS ARE SUITABLE? 
HOW GRADED? HOW CONDUCTED? 
J. K. STAPLES, HOUSTON, TEXAS. 
After athletics had been used in educational institutions to 
foster a school spirit and give the school prestige, and gym- 
nastics and calisthenics had been used to counteract the evil 
effects of the artificial life of the school room and to produce 
physical health and strength, it was generally discovered that 
such periods of physical exercise were the most potent of all 
school hours in the social and moral development of the pupils, 
that athletics required some mental application, and that they 
could be used as a lever to force the athletically inclined 
student to raise his scholarship to a very satisfactory grade. 
So physical training has been found to be social moral and 
mental training. It is mental training of the most vigorous 
type; it is brain building as well as muscle building. The men- 
tal element predominates; it is the one which most limits the 
progress of a pupil. All action of the voluntary muscles is a 
result of mental activity. Every new purposeful movement 
has to be learned with the brain. The brain then, so to speak, 
teaches the movement to the muscles. 
Physical education is the process of acquiring both mental 
and physical vitality and efficiency, health ideals, habits of 
hygienic living, and habits of social and moral actions so 
 
-P-A-G-E-602

600 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
thoroughly established that they will operate when personal 
interests and ambitions reach crises. The selecting, grading 
* and conducting of physical exercises and athletics should be 
done upon a basis of physical education and not upon a basis 
of muscular development. 
What forms are suitable? Suitable forms of athletics, 
enumerated from the standpoint of the unit competing, will 
include the following: (1) For the individual—high jump, 
running or standing; broad jump, running or standing; hop, 
step and jump, with running or standing start; three standing 
broad jumps; dash of 30 to 100 yards; long run of 220 yards; 
potato race; hare and hound chase; cross country hike; chin- 
ning the bar; basket ball throw for distance; oat bag throw 
for height. (2) For the team—Newcomb, dodge ball, long ball, 
center ball, relay racing, captain ball, volley ball, indoor base- 
ball, baseball, basket ball, association football, track meet. 
(3) For the grade or class—chinning the horizontal bar, stand- 
ing broad jump, forty to sixty yard dash, all-up relay, flag 
relay, climbing the vertical ladder, walking the horizontal 
ladder on the hands, folk dancing. 
Suitable forms or non-competitive physical exercises are 
short setting-up drills, graded calisthenics with and without 
apparatus, folk dancing, social dancing, gymnastic dancing, 
gymnastics in the well-equipped gymnasium or on outdoor gym- 
nastic apparatus, singing games, chasing and tag games, ball 
games, finger plays, constructive plays, imitative plays and 
play on playground apparatus. 
How graded? This problem alone is too large to be satis- 
factorily treated within the limits of a twenty minutes’ paper. 
All of the athletic events listed as suitable for the individual 
are suitable for the boys of all the grammar grades, and they 
are difficult or easy according to the standards set as to dis- 
tance, speed or form. Girls can profitably participate in these 
events except the hare and hound chase, the running of dis- 
tances over 60 yards, and jumping. Of course, running and 
jumping should not be forbidden to girls, but competitive work 
in these events should not be undertaken except where there is 
\ very careful supervision of their work. 
Grading in these events is effected by the division of the com- 
petitors according to school grade, age, height, or weight, or  
-P-A-G-E-603
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 601 
by the combination of two of these factors. The distance of 
the dash for the fifth grade boys, or the smaller boys if height 
or weight is the determining factor, is usually 50 yards; for 
the sixth grade boys 60 yards; for the seventh grade boys 
70 yards, and for the eighth grade boys 100 yards. The dis- 
tances for the girls of each grade are approximately two-thirds 
of that of the boys of the same grade. Grading is further 
effected by limiting the number of events in which any person 
may compete on any one day to two, three or four events. 
The team games named above are given in the order of their 
simplicity. Newcomb, dodge ball, long ball, center ball and 
relay racing can be used very successfully with the fifth grade 
boys and girls. Captain ball and volley ball belong to the next 
higher grade, and baseball and basket ball and association 
football will be played successfully by the seventh and eighth 
grades. Track meets can be used in all the grammar grades. 
Their difficulty lies not with the pupils, but in the management. 
The competitive team games should be used in their season; 
for instance, baseball is a spring game. Grading does not 
require that each spring some new game should be substituted 
for baseball, nor that there should be changes in the playing 
rules of baseball. Each season the players are expected to 
show increased skill and better team work. Grading could be 
effected by changing the.size of the diamond and the size of 
the ball. 
Games, plays and dances do not submit readily to grading. 
Of course, some are shorter than others, and some demand finer 
neuro-muscular codrdinations than others. Nevertheless, chil- 
dren, parents and grandparents may join in the same games, 
plays and dances, such as drop the handkerchief, blind man’s 
buff or highland fling, and seem to get equal enjoyment out of 
them. “Games for the Playground, Home, School and Gym- 
nasium,” by Miss Jessie Bancroft, is the most extensive of re- 
cent efforts to grade games. The basis of her grading is child 
interest, and games are classed as belonging to the lowest age 
at which, as an extended investigation has shown, pupils will 
play the games with interest. A function of games is to re- 
create or rejuvenate, and the ability to enjoy childish games 
should be prolonged or made permanent. The writer was not 
long ago at an adult social where the evening was spent in
-P-A-G-E-604
  602 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
playing kindergarten games, and it was the most enjoyable 
party that he had attended since his boyhood days. All present 
seemed to have found it equally enjoyable. 
Gymnastics are easily graded. The basis is the amount of 
strength required and the fineness of the neuro-muscular 
coérdinations. Numerous exercises for each piece of apparatus 
are listed according to their difficulty in execution and their 
developmental values. What is to be classed as grade one 
should include what a class should learn on each piece of 
apparatus in a term, but the amount will depend upon the 
length of and the frequency of the gymnasium period. 
Calisthenics, too, are easily graded, especially educational 
calisthenics, the object of which is the neuro-muscular coér- 
dinations. The simple two-count forearm flexion may be in- 
creased in difficulty through a thousand steps in numerous 
ways, such as increasing the number of counts; using the two 
forearms simultaneously, alternately or in continuous alterna- 
tion; starting the exercise in different arm or body positions; 
combining or alternating the movement with arm swings or 
thrusts, or with head, body, leg or foot movements; making the 
flexions in different or alternating planes, or with the leg, body 
or foot movements being made in different or alternating planes. 
Corrective or preventative and vitality building exercises are 
graded with reference to the intensity and frequency of con- 
tractions and the effects upon circulation, respiration and per- 
spiration. Recreative calisthenics should have a place in every 
drill, but the use of this form of exercises is limited by school ° 
discipline. 
How conducted? In some of our large cities there is a. 
director of physical education, several assistant directors, sev- 
eral athletic inspectors, district supervisors, instructors for 
every high school gymnasium and for every ward school gym- 
nasium, and in the training schools there is an extensive course 
in physical education. Every primary teacher conducts, sev- 
eral times daily, a two-minute setting-up exercise and once 
daily a ten-minute lesson in grade calisthenics in the school 
room, hallway or playground, or substitutes therefor a lesson 
in story gymnastics or a game or a folk dance. Every grammar

nasium the grammar grade classes are taken to the gymnasium 
two or three times a week for thirty or forty-five-minute les- 
sons. Athletics and folk dances have a place in these gym- 
nasium periods as well as in many after-school classes. The 
athletes do not monopolize the time of the instructors. To 
those who most need the work the instructors are most atten- 
tive. Inter-school games are giving way to inter-class and 
intra-class games and the group contests and the athletic badge 
contests are coming into popular favor. 
In those cities in which there is no physical director in the 
schools, little physical work of real value is being done. There 
is hope, however, that the physical work in the primary grades 
in such cities will soon be given proper attention, for all good 
normal schools now require their students to take courses 
which should qualify them to conduct in the primary grades 
recreative and graded calisthenic drills, games and folk dances. 
But the conducting of the work in the grammar grades is de- 
cidedly more difficult. It requires a special aptitude and con- 
siderable training and experience. But surely something 
should be done on every school ground with the pupils of the 
grammar grades to get positive results from the sixteen to 
twenty per cent of the school day which is set aside for recesses 
and for the after-school hours. The obligation of a school to 
its pupils does not cease at 3 o’clock nor is it suspended during 
the daily recesses. 
Then, what can be done? The easiest and apparently the 
most common thing is to give the boys a baseball, basket ball 
or football, according to the season, and to the girls a basket 
ball. The balls will occupy the time of a small proportion of 
the pupils during the recesses, and if games are scheduled be- 
tween schools and a trophy put up there will be some mis- 
cellaneous practice after school occasionally, and the schedule 
will be partially played. But without coaching and capable 
officials inter-school league games are sure to produce many 
undesirable results. The production of good results, beyond 
the increasing of the interest in the game, is questionable; and 
this increased interest in the game is valuable only so far as 
it is utilized in developing a larger number of teams to play 
intra-school games. 
The athletic badge contest and the grade contests are of
-P-A-G-E-606

more value. They can be operated with less friction and with- 
out any necessarily bad resulis. They have the splendid feat- 
ures of involving practically all the students of the grades and 
of providing for the boys an all-round development. The award 
in the individual contest is a bronze or silver button or pin, and 
in the grade contests a trophy. The events are several, the 
chinning of the bar, the forty or sixty-yard dash and the stand- 
ing broad jump being the most popular for the boys. Competi- 
tion in one event is held in the fall, in a second in the winter, 
and in the third in the spring. The boys who can make the 
standard set in each event, say four times in chinning, five feet 
and nine inches in the jump, and the sixty-yard dash in eight 
and three-fifths seconds, is given a bronze button. When he is 
able to make six feet six inches in the jump, chin the bar six 
times and make the sixty yards in eight and one-fifth seconds 
he is given the silver badge or button. In order to win their 
badge the girls may have to inake a record of nine seconds in 
the sixty yard dash and throw the basket ball thirty-five feet, 
or the badge may be given only to those girls who are members 
of the grade which wins the grade contest. The records ob- 
tained in the individual contests may be used in determining 
the grade championships. To do this the records of eighty 
per cent of the boys of any one grade are reduced to an average. 
The school showing the largest average jump wins the grade 
trophy of that grade, and the schools having the best record 
in chinning and running win the trophies for these events. 
However, if there is only one trophy for each grade, the average 
in each of the three events is reduced to points and the winner 
is thus determined. As an iJlustration, eight points may be 
given for every unit and fractional part thereof that the chin- 
ning record is above two. The event for the girls in the grade 
contest is often folk dancing or a relay race. In every case the 
average is based upon the work of eighty per cent of the pupils 
in a grade and each school conducts its work at its own build- 
ing. In the grade contests a verification of the records is neces- 
sary. A disinterested person re-conducts the contests in those 
schools which have reported the highest averages. 
~ Team games are too valuable an educational means to be 
neglected. With very little effort a sustaining interest can be 
developed in games, long bal! and modified volley ball being

favorites. These two games are particularly suitable for school 
grounds because they present little difficulty in officiating and 
because they can be played without an official with an unusual 
degree of satisfaction. Both games are free from the dangers 
of over-exertion and physical injuries and both require very 
little playing space and equipment. There are many other 
valuable games, some easy, some difficult; but the good results 
obtained from them will depend upon the amount of super- 
vision given the playing. 
To help make this paper of practical value it may be worth 
while to outline the work which is planned for the Houston 
schools, where for two years there has been a large amount of 
competition between the fourteen ward schools in baseball, 
football, basket ball and indoor baseball leagues and in track 
meets and cross-country runs. The competitive element has 
been the predominant one, and the chief of the good results 
has been the creating of interest in the games. Our main pur- 
pose now is to develop a large number of teams at each school 
and encourage them to play games among themselves. In this 
respect success has been immediate. One school has twenty 
volley ball teams which utilize five courts practically every re- 
cess. Two other schools have eight teams playing a tourna- 
ment among themselves. This game is the immediate substi- 
tute for rugby football, the two leagues of which have been 
discontinued. Next year association football will take the 
place of rugby football. Volley ball is being played with 
thirteen schools in a tournament and a total of forty-eight 
teams of six players each. There is a tournament for the boys 
over five feet in height and one for the girls of this height; and 
there is one for the boys and girls each of less than five feet. 
The city has been divided into four sections and each is playing 
for a sectional championship. A team has to play and win 
only two games to become the sectional champions, and these 
champions play but two more games in the city semifinals and 
finals. Every game is being officiated by the director alone, and 
so far every game has been a social occasion, though the com- 
petition has been none the less keen. The game has been taught 
the pupils by having each school send every Saturday to the 
high school gymnasium several representatives. This has en- 
abled a thorough teaching of the playing rules and has been 
 
-P-A-G-E-608

greatly valuable in creating a proper relationship among the 
pupils of the various schools. No trophies are to be awarded 
in the volley ball leagues this year. For the games of basket 
ball and indoor baseball which have been played for several 
years by the boys and girls a limited schedule will be arranged, 
but the greater stress will be placed upon the intra-school 
games and invitation games. The smaller girls will be taught 
long ball, but it is doubtful whether there will be any league 
arranged for them. The boys will have a league in baseball 
and a track meet will be held in the spring at the Y. M. ©. A. 
A start towards class athletics will be made with the con- 
ducting of a short dash at each school and a relay carnival. 
In the former event the distance will be thirty yards. Bighty 
per cent of the pupils of a grade will be placed behind a start- 
ing mark. The timer and starter will stand at the finishing 
mark. <A pupil takes his position on the mark and the starter 
gives him the starting signal by dropping a handkerchief. As 
this runner crosses the finishing line the handkerchief is drop- 
ped again and runner number two, who has meanwhile taken 
his position on the starting line, immediately begins to run. 
Other runners are started in the same way and the time is 
taken when the last runner finishes. Dividing by the number 
of runners gives the grade average for that school. In the 
relay carnival any school may enter a team of ten boys and 
one of ten girls from each of the fifth, sixth and seventh grades. 
The distance for the girls will be thirty yards and for the boys, 
sixty yards. The championship for the boys and for the girls 
of each grade will be competed for, and the awarding of points 
for firsts, seconds and thirds will determine the school winning 
the city championship. Splendid results from this work is 
expected, and it will undoubtedly be the bid athletic day of the 
school year. 
The physical work in our primary grades consists of a two- 
minute setting-up drill given once daily and of an eight-minute 
daily lesson in graded calisthenics. Provision for games and 
folk dances will probably be made for next term. 
THE TRAINING OF THE HUMAN BODY. 
W. B., METZENTHIN, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS. 
In a gathering such as this, composed as it is almost exclu- 
sively of exponents of some form of physical education, it
-P-A-G-E-609
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 607 
seems hardly necessary to emphasize the necessity for the sys- 
tematic training of the human body. Modern conditions are 
such that, unless opportunity is provided for some form of or- 
ganized physical exercise, the race will before long hopelessly 
deteriorate. In fact, this process has already set in, as all 
those who have given this vital question the consideration it 
deserves, well know. 
It is perfectly natural that this should be true, for the many 
and varied opportunities which an earlier and more primitive 
civilization offered for physical exercise have largely passed 
away with that age. And we physical educators further know, 
as indeed all thinking persons ought to know, that failure to 
exercise any function means inevitable atrophy, and in the final 
analysis atrophy means death. Emperor William’s epigram- 
matic saying, “If I rest, I rust,” is as applicable in this nar- 
rower as in the wider sense. 
Why is it that the general public is as yet so little interested 
in this all-important question? Without attempting an ex- 
haustive analysis, it may safely be said that one of the reasons 
is our proximity to the pioneer age; it is because as yet the 
momentum of the splendid constitutions which many of us 
possess as our most valuable heritage from our ancestors, who 
enured their bodies by the hard labor incidental to the age in 
which they lived, is sustaining us in spite of all we seem only 
too much inclined to do to undermine our inherited constitu- 
tions, in spite of all we are disinclined to do to keep them 
reasonably near their level. But we are fast exhausting our 
resources. One’s bank account has a startling way of melting 
away when “all’s going out and nothing coming in.” 
The most effective teaching is done by means of object lessons, 
and one might be inclined to let things drift along and take 
care of themselves in the easy, laissez faire style, so characteris- 
tic in our youthful, naively optimistic people, until the dire 
effects of the shameful neglect of our bodies become so apparent 
that even “the blind would see and the deaf hear” if it were 
not for the fact that those who merit the punishment most were 
of necessity largely immune from the penalty, while untold 
millions yet unborn would be the innocent sufferers. 
The selfishly indifferent attitude of many so-called enlight- 
ened men is typified by the remark made to me recently by a
-P-A-G-E-610
Ne a eT ee ee eT 
608 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
prominent college professor iu this State, who boasted that he 
had never taken any exercise in his life, except that incidental 
to his daily occupations. He seemed to be enjoying fair health 
and may in his own person never reap the penalty of his 
neglect. But what about his children, and their children in 
turn, if they take the same view of their responsibility to pos- 
terity, and do no more than their ancestor to keep up the heri- 
tage of physical vigor? How long before their “bank account” 
will be exhausted, when the constant drain on their resources 
is not from time to time balanced by occasional deposits? 
This type of individual doesn’t believe in “crossing the bridge 
before getting to it,” but likewise does not possess foresight 
enough to think of repairing it even when it is in imminent 
danger of collapse. The old adage of “an ounce of prevention” 
is as true in this as in all other applications. Doubtlessly a 
remedy for the consequences of the neglect of the fundamental 
: laws of health will ultimately be found before the human race 
is exterminated, but it is both inhumane and unnecessary to 
sacrifice in the meantime countless numbers on the altar of 
ignorance and indolence. We are expending millions for fight- 
ing disease in many cases brought on directly or indirectly 
through sheer physical slothfulness; we are spending many 
more millions for taking care in our various penitentiaries, 
hospitals and asylums of the moral, physical and mental wrecks 
our system, or lack of system, of physical education has been 
largely instrumental in producing. 
In a modern enlightened scheme of education the needs of 
the body must be the one foremost consideration. So far from 
common sense have we drifted, so warped and disproportionate 
have our ideas and ideals become, that it is almost all an 
educator’s professional reputation is worth to boldly and un- 
| compromisingly enunciate such “heresy ;” if not met with indig- 
nant protest, it is indulgently or indifferently received, and in 
either case promptly forgotten. 
| There is no doubt that the educational pyramid has become 
grotesquely and dangerously inverted; the base, which is and 
| ought to be the body, has steadily been pared and pruned until 
now it resembles more nearly the apex, while the apex, which 
| represents the mental side, has been inflated to the dimensions 
of the base. An educational system which increases and empha-  
-P-A-G-E-611
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 609 
sizes the intellectual at the expense of the physical, presents 
about as pleasing a sight and gives about the same impression 
of stability and safety as the inverted pyramid. 
Without, then, attempting more than merely to suggest the 
need of organized training for the human body inasmuch as 1 
feel that we are all practically in accord with this idea, I shall 
make the attempt to determine, first, what are the results we 
wish to attain and are expected to attain in this activity, and, 
secondly, what are the means by which we can attain most 
completely and effectively these results. 
Results.—On the purely physical side there is first of all 
the vital one of building up, or laying the foundations for the 
highest possible degree of physical health and bodily tone by 
means of the healthy stimulation through exercise of all phys- 
ical functions; secondly, the nermal-developmental, increasing 
the general physical efficiency, activity, skill and endurance, 
and teaching mental contro] over motor mechanism; thirdly, 
the subnormal-corrective, including the development by means 
of special exercises of subnormal organs and functions, with a 
view to increasing their capacity for the performance of their 
work and for greater resistance to strain and other attacks to 
which they are at all times liable, as well as special corrective 
exercises for the milder form of deformities. I shall limit 
myself in this paper to a discussion of the first two. 
If a course in physical training would offer no other advan- 
tages than I have just outlined on the exclusively physical side 
alone, it would more than justify all the attention we can give 
it. But there is immeasurably more to be gained when prop- 
erly organized and guarded than would appear to the super- 
ficial observer, and it is this element of our work we should 
stress and bring to the fore in all our discussions and argu- 
ments for the necessity of such training along with other sub- 
jects of the curriculum. This type of argument will probably 
make a greater appeal to a constituency which as yet refuses 
to entertain as seriously the problems dealing with the “merely” 
physical, as they do those involving the more time-honored and 
traditional ones of the mind and the spirit. I refer to the 
general educational-disciplinary aspect of physical education.

This may properly be divided into four large categories, the 
first of which, the mental, contains elements of discipline as 
well as elements of diversion, the former training among others 
the valuable qualities of ingenuity, initiative, judgment, percep- 
tion and quick-wittedness; the latter supplying the very essen- 
tial elements of spontaneity, relaxation, buoyancy and whole- 
some fun. The second, which we ‘shall call the social-ethical, 
embracing elements of character of the most fundamental char- 
acter, promotes the virtues of generosity, patience, evenness of 
temper, inculcates and inspires courage and ambition, encour- 
ages the sense of fair play, a regard for the rights of others, 
teaches the value of team play and fosters the spirit of true 
democracy and good-fellowship. On the esthetic side it helps 
materially to create a feeling for beauty and symmetry, not 
merely in the abstract, but in the most concrete and tangible 
form, and conversely develops a feeling of contempt for and 
disgust with the avoidable ugly and unharmonious, while 
on the moral side it leads by stern object lessons to an appre- 
ciation of, clean and abstemious living. 
Having ascertained and enumerated the different results, let 
us try briefly to consider the different means by which these 
desirable ends may be secured, and to determine if possible 
which one of them will combine within itself the greatest num- 
ber of good together with the least number of objectionable 
features. 
Means.—Let us roughly divide these into three great groups, 
the first of which may be called the system of formal exercises, 
including Swedish gymnastics—free movements; German gym- 
nastics—heavy “turn” apparatus; class drills with dumbbells, 
clubs, wands, etc.; the second, organized games, under qualified 
leaders, requiring no special training or extraordinary ability, 
the end and aim of which is fun, recreation and diversion, and 
not primarily victory; the third, athletics, under an expert 
“coach,” requiring considerable training and unusual ability, 
whose chief aim is avowedly victory. 
For the sake of greater conciseness and therefore greater 
clearness, I have grouped the most apparent “virtues” and 
“defects” of each of these systems opposite each other:

game system the greatest possible amount of good will accrue 
to the participant, not so much, or certainly not exclusively, 
on the physical side alone, the “competitive sports” system has 
been introduced at the University of Texas, and it is my 
pleasure to be able to report that a year and a half’s trial at 
this institution has amply vindicated our judgment. Not only 
has there been no diminution of physical efficiency, but rather 
has it been improved generally, and what I consider of far 
greater importance, the work has become pleasurable and gen- 
uinely diverting, where formerly it was considered the greatest 
bore and worst drudgery of the curriculum. In order to in- 
crease and encourage initiative and spontaneity, as well as to 
discourage what is familiarly known as “soldiering,” physical 
efficiency tests are held twice a year, the training for which is 
left largely to the discretion of the individual student, and the 
inability at the end of a term to come up to a reasonable 
standard is sufficient evidence of the necessity of the student’s 
taking a similar course the following term; in other words, the 
student receives no credit for “physical training” unless he is 
able to pass these tests. But probably most important of all! 
and tending toward the most far-reaching effect on the char- 
acter of the participant is the method of having any infringe- 
ments of playing rules reported by the offender himself instead 
of having an official impose penalties. It is a source of supreme 
gratification to be able to attest to the success of this icono- 
clastic innovation, for while occasionally in the heat of the 
conilict there occur occasional lapses memoriae, even the 
chronic sneak is before long shamed by the sheer weight of 
public opinion into a recognition of the principle of the “square 
deai.” 
In closing permit me to make an appeal to all of you here 
assembled to make active propaganda for the cause in the be- 
half of which I have had the honor to address you. The method 
for carrying on such a much-needed campaign might properly 
be left to the judgment of the individual ; I would urge on you, 
however, to get out as much as possible with you pupils, to be- 
come acquainted with them, to set them the best possible ex- 
ample of physical and athletic efficiency and proficiency, to 
know the rules of their sports a little more accurately than 
they themselves, to neglect no opportunity to emphasize,

especially when speaking with parents, the need of careful 
supervision of the pupil’s health and the importance of en- 
couraging them to engage in wholesome, carefully supervised 
and regulated sport as the most effective preparation for life. 
OUTDOOR VS. INDOOR GYMNASIA FOR HIGH SCHOOL 
AND COLLEGE. 
JOHN E. LOMBARD, NEW ORLEANS, LA. 
The struggle for existence is over so far as physical education 
is concerned. There is no longer need to convince a reluctant 
public or a still more reluctant educational profession of the 
real service that rational physical training can render to the 
educator in fitting the pupil for his work in the school and in 
after life. 
Inspection of the program of any educational meeting will 
reveal this advanced stage in thought concerning this phase 
of education. It is no longer a question whether physical train- 
ing is desirable or needful as an adjunct to school work. It 
has become a question as to how much is desirable, and of what 
kind it should be. Alive to this spirit of the age in such mat- 
ters, educators may waive excuses for injecting such discussion 
into educational meetings and proceed to deliberate upon those 
phases of the subject demanding attention. 
The determination of the kind of equipment needed should be 
among the first subjects to enlist attention. A judicious selec- 
tion of the best equipment at the outset means a saving of the 
expense of changing. In this selection it is unwise for South- 
ern educators to be guided entirely by the experience in other 
sections. The climate in a large fraction of the South is such 
as to render outdoor work practicable throughout the school 
session. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to consider 
carefully whether this fortunate natural advantage may not 
make it possible for institutions in the South to so alter their 
plans for physical training as to avail themselves at a smaller 
cost of the superior hygienic conditions surrounding outdoor 
work. 
The Southern college or high school that is on the point of 
equipping itself with gymnasium facilities may be confronted 
by any one of a number of differing sets of conditions. First, 
we have the institutions so located that comparative rigor of
-P-A-G-E-616
  614 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
climate imposes conditions analogous to those in the North. 
Second, the institution with large financial resources. Third, 
the institution with limited financial resources in a location 
such that the space available for an outdoor gymnasium would 
be no greater than that for one of the indoor type. Fourth, 
the institution with limited resources, but not restricted in 
space. 
First. Rigorous Climate. For institutions of the first-men- 
tioned class, 7. ¢., those located in comparatively rigorous cli- 
matic surroundings, the indoor type of gymnasium would ap- 
pear to be imperative, as in such locations all lighter forms of 
. exercise and apparatus work are practically impossible except 
under the protection of artificially-heated buildings. 
Second. Large Financial Resources.—The institution with 
large financial resources will not deliberate between the alterna- 
tives of applying a limited sum either to an outdoor gymnasium 
or to an indoor gymnasium. Its sole object will be to select 
the equipment that will yield the best results, whether such 
equipment involves one or both types. The problem under 
these circumstances should be comparatively simple. At first 
glance it might appear that the logical and complete solution 
would result from the immediate erection of both outdoor and 
indoor types. But such a course involves an element of danger 
to the establishment of the most satisfactory final plan of work. 
In the formative period of a system of physical training in an 
institution provided from the outset with both types of gym- 
nasia, that system would be subjected to the temptation to 
follow precedent blindly and to grow up around the traditions 
of the indoor gymnasium, leaving the outdoor gymnasium to 
serve as an overflow only. On the other hand, if only the out- 
door gymnasium is provided in the beginning, the instructor, 
brought into forced contact with conditions inherently more 
elastic, will develop a system more suited to the outdoor condi- 
tions and not bound or limited by indoor tradition. So that 
when the indoor equipment is finally added, it will fall natural- 
ly into its proper place as an adjunct to the outdoor gymnasium 
for use in bad weather. 
Third. Limited Resources and Limited Space.—For institu- 
tions with limited resources and also with only so much space 
available as would be required for the erection of an indoor
-P-A-G-E-617
JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 615 
gymnasium, the determination of the better type is not so easy. 
‘The advantages and disadvantages must be weighed carefully. 
On the one hand, the smaller initial cost of the outdoor type 
and its superior healthfulness form a strong combination of 
advantages against which the indoor type, on the other hand, 
offers but one valuable advantage—that of continuity of ser- 
vice even in bad weather. If physical training were the only 
consideration is determining the issue, the writer can hardly 
see how the selection could be made without yielding to the 
arguments of smaller cost and greater healthfulness. But an- 
other consideration heaves into the foreground with institutions 
with greatly restricted space. In such institutions the gym- 
nasium is of necessity crowded close to the lecture rooms, so 
that an outdoor gymnasium where proper free rein is given to 
the play spirit would be a nuisance to the lecturers and their 
classes. In such a case it weuld be necessary to arrange the 
classes in the gymnasium so as to avoid the class hours for the 
lecture rooms affected. This plan would hamper the service 
of the gymnasium to such an extent as to overbalance the ad- 
vantages of cost and healthfulness, and make is more satisfac- 
tory all around to install the indoor type. 
Fourth. Restricted Resources and Ample Space.—Institu- 
tions of the fourth-mentioned class, 7. ¢., those with small finan- 
cial resources and ample space, may settle the question entirely 
upon its merits. For institutions of this class, as for those of 
the preceding class, the outdoor type of gymnasium has the 
advantages of smaller initial cost and greater healthfulness, and 
has an additional advantage not less effective in determining 
the selection. No matter how much ground space is available 
the initial cost will always restrict the size of the indoor gym- 
nasium and limit the floor space. But with ample grounds the 
outdoor type can expand to suit the needs without great addi- 
tional cost. A part of the ground can be set apart for the 
apparatus and another part for the games and sports. 
The visitor to an indoor gymnasium of average size cannot 
fail to be struck by the ingenious devices and arrangements for 
freeing the main floor from apparatus that would interfere 
with the playing of team games. Such ingenuity makes it pos- 
sible to have either games or apparatus work at will, but when 
a game is in progress the apparatus work must stop, and vice
-P-A-G-E-618
  616 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
versa, With such equipment the gymnasium classes must be 
scheduled so as to afford opportunity for both kinds of work. 
This can be done either by shortening the time allotted to each 
kind, or by increasing the length of the gymnasium period for 
each class. 
In a large school, with many pupils who use the gymnasium, 
the classes are so numerous that the schedule maker finds him- 
self between the Scylla of abbreviating the classes so much as 
to subtract greatly from their training values, and the Crarybdis 
of so lengthening the gymnasium hours that many of the classes 
would have to wait for later and more inconvenient periods. 
The outdoor gymnasium, in which games and apparatus 
work may be conducted simultaneously, will suffer from neither 
of these objections and the interest and enthusiasm of the pupil 
can be much better retained. That the outdoor gymnasium, by 
reason of its ability to care for large numbers at convenient 
hours, can prove its claim of enlisting a more enthusiastic and 
sustained interest is clearly shown by the records of attendance 
at the playgrounds of the Chicago South Side Park System. 
Take as an example the attendance at the playground known 
as Sherman Park: Outdoor gymnasium, 5 months, 203,000, 
1909; indoor gymnasium, 7 months, 34,000, 1909. That the 
interest is sustained, as well as enthusiasm, is shown by the 
fact that the attendance at the outdoor gymnasium in August, 
the fourth month of the season, was 41,000, as compared with 
30,000 for May, the first month. This gives a ratio of attend- 
ance of about eight times as many children per month for the 
outdoor gymnasium as for the indoor, a ratio fairly uniform 
among the playgrounds of the South Side Park System. 
If the real aim of the department of physical training in a 
high school or college were the production of winning teams or 
the fullest development of the powers of those young men al- 
ready specially fit, the outdoor gymnasium would be forced to 
rest its case on the superior health-giving power of outdoor 
exercise and the smaller initial ‘cost of the plant. But the 
department of physical training would fail in its chief duty to 
the institution and to the pupils by confining its efforts to 
those already fit. 
The true educator, whether he be concerned with the train- 
ing of the mind or of body, will make it his business to devote
-P-A-G-E-619
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 617 
equal energy to developing the latent powers of the pupil of 
moderate natural ability and the pupil of great natural ability. 
To fulfill his mission as far as physical training is concerned, 
the educator must be provided with an equipment sufficiently 
elastic to care for large numbers without undue haste and 
crowding, a condition far more nearly approached by the out- 
door gymnasium than by the indoor. 
The advantage enjoyed by the indoor gymnasium of afford- 
ing continuous service, as opposed to the interrupted service 
offered by the outdoor type due to bad weather, should be given 
due weight in the consideration; but there is danger that too 
much weight may be attached to it unless the conditions be 
fully analyzed. 
A New Orleans outdoor gymnasium would probably suffer 
as much from the interruptions of rain as the average, so a 
partial analysis of conditions there will yield information that 
could serve as a guide. During January, February and March 
the average number of days upon which more than .01 inches of 
rain falls is 8 per month, in April and May the average number 
is about 12, in October the average is 5, in November 6, and in 
December 10. A rain that fell at night, unless it were a very 
heavy rain, would not affect outdoor gymnasium classes. A 
rain that fell in the afternoon would not affect morning classes. 
And a light rain falling in the morning would not affect after- 
noon classes. In the worst months this would mean an inter- 
ruption of about one class in every eight, while in the best 
months the interruption would be less than one in every twelve. 
The average interruption would probably be less than one in 
ten. The instructor should have no difficulty in arranging his 
program so that these expected interruptions need not disturb 
the orderly progress of his work. The figures here given will 
probably be much improved when the experiments now being 
made in various sections are successfully concluded. 
In Chicago, the South Side Park System is experimenting 
with a mixture of bitumen and cork, which bids fair to yield 
a satisfactory surfacing for the outdoor gymnasium. Such a 
surface as the one aimed at by the experimenters will make 
the outdoor gymnasium available for use immediately after 
the hardest rain. 
It will not be attempted here to give details of relative 
 
-P-A-G-E-620
618 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
costs of indoor and outdoor equipment. Such an estimate in 
full detail would involve a most intricate and unending jug- 
gling of differing figures resulting from differing local condi- 
tions and differing grades of equipment desired. From 
figures that have come under the eye of the writer it would 
appear that the indoor type of gymnasium costs for erection 
and full equipment, twice or three times as much as the out- 
door type. 
It would not be profitable to consume much of your time 
with discussion of the superior health-giving power of the out- 
door gymnasium, for conviction of the validity of this claim 
is no doubt already fully established in the minds of those 
who concern themselves with questions affecting the bodily 
vigor of children. The chief reason for this acknowledged 
superiority of outdoor over indoor exercise are that out of 
doors’ the air retains its full percentage of oxygen, it is not 
contaminated by the products of the combustion taking place 
in the lungs, and the lurking danger in house dust are en- 
tirely lacking in dust on the ground surface where nature’s 
great purifiers—the wind, the rain and the sun—are able to 
perform their functions without hindrance. 
The foregoing paragraphs involve what the writer regards 
‘as the essential points in the controversy. But there is no in- 
tention to imply that these points are the only ones worthy of 
consideration, or that the points taken up have received the 
detailed treatment to which their importance entitles them. 
Considerations which one may regard as of minor significance 
in another man’s eyes assume large proportions. Men well 
qualified to weigh relative values in matters pertaining to 
physical training urges with much insistance the necessity of 
an indoor gymnasium to a college for the purpose of prepar- 
ing teams for competition on an equal footing with teams from 
institutions provided with this type of equipment. It is spe 
cifically urged that success in competing with other institu- 
tions in the game of basket ball cannot be obtained without 
training in an indoor gymnasium, that the success and life of 
this game depend upon the possession of an indoor gymnasium 
provided with accommodations for spectators. This consider- 
ation was omitted from the list of advantages and disadvan- 
tages of the indoor type of gymnasium in spite of the empha-
-P-A-G-E-621
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 619 
sis laid upon it by some men because of the conviction that 
the value placed upon it was the result of a too faithful ad- 
herence to the traditions of the game which was invented as 
an indoor sport. A properly prepared surface on an outdoor 
court would readily take the place of the wooden floor; and 
as for the spectators, it is hardly probable, if we are to judge 
by the experience with football, that the weather would keep 
them away. The point raised does not appear to have weight 
enough to be used in helping to determine the character of the 
gymnasium equipment. 
Others equally well qualified to weigh these questions have 
urged that an indoor gymnasium is essential for the use of 
girls, both because of the seclusion afforded for exercise in cor- 
rect costume, and because of the added need for protection 
against the weather where delicate girls are concerned. These 
points were given no attention in the direct consideration of 
the relative values of indoor and out door equipment for the 
same reason, the conviction that their fancied value arose from 
adherence to the traditions of the indoor gymnasium. Quite 
satisfactory seclusion should be obtainable with the judicious 
employment of fences and hedges. And none of the arguments 
for outdoor exercise for boys lose value when applied to girls. 
If there be any difference, it is one of degree and not of kind. 
The conclusion of this paper is approached with some hesi- 
tation and even with misgiving. The course of reasoning fol- 
lowed in the discussion here given seems to lead clearly to 
definite ends and to leave but little lattitude for the exercise 
of the selective faculty. But the problem here presented is 
comparatively a new one, and as is the case with every de- 
parture from common practice, experience can put the final 
stamp of approval upon the change. The purpose of this 
paper is to arouse interest in a subject of the first magnitude 
and not to recommend a change without first giving the whole 
problem the most careful attention. If this paper contributes 
its mite toward arousing that deep and concentrated interest 
needed for a correct final settlement of the whole question, the 
writer’s satisfaction will be complete.

ARTHUR L. MANCHESTER, SPARTANBURG, S. C. 
The Music Department of the Southern Educational Asso- 
ciation is young. Beginning its career at this time, when a 
marked difference in the attitude of educators toward music 
as a factor in education is apparent, it faces great opportuni- 
ties for the betterment of music education, opportunities of 
which musicians who are interested in the advancement of 
music should earnestly avail themselves. 
At present musical educational activities are in the hands 
of four divisions of musical workers—namely, the private 
teacher, the independent schools of music, college music de- 
patments, and teachers of music in the public schools. Each 
of these divisions is working along lines of its own, too largely 
without reference to what is being done by its confreres, and 
with very little if any idea of codperation in obtaining results. 
Despite various attempts to secure effective codperation, there 
still exists wide differences of standard and educational ideals.
-P-A-G-E-623
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 621 
The problem before teachers of music today is the welding of 
these educational divisions into a homogeneous educational 
force, which will have power to raise the standards and 
methods of music teaching until comprehensive music educa- 
tion is a fact. To the solution of this problem this depart- 
ment of the association can and should intelligently and per- 
sistently devote itself. 
Each of these divisions has a work to do that it alone can 
do to the best advantage. Music is complex; it has its scien- 
tific, esthetic, pedagogic and cultured aspects, each also com- 
plex in character and providing material for serious and long- 
continued study. Instrumental music, including various in- 
struments and the orchestra; vocal music, including solo sing- 
ing, choral music, opera and oratorio; theory, including 
grammar, form and composition, have rapidly developed into 
well-defined specialties, each possessing its own peculiar 
technique and requirements of instruction and attracting a 
constantly increasing body of students. The circumstances 
under which instruction in these branches of music is given 
are so varied that no one of these divisions can be dispensed 
with, hence their proper codrdination is the primal question. 
For the solution of this problem I wish to make some sugges- 
tions, but before doing so it is necessary that we understand, 
as clearly as may be, the present situation of music teaching. 
In an investigation into the present status of music edu- 
cation in the United States, which I conducted for the Bureau 
of Education at Washington, I secured some data which led 
me to draw a conclusion which bears upon this phase of the 
subject, and I take the liberty of quoting from a paper which 
I read before the Music Teachers’ National Association at its 
meeting in Washington, in 1908. 
That the present scheme of music education as a whole is 
faulty will hardly be challenged. We know that carefully 
guarded progression from elementary phases of instruction, 
including such essentials of future musicianship as genuine 
ear-training and positive perception of tone-relationships, 
through successive stages of steadily broadening musical con- 
sciousness and knowledge of the studies of advanced grade, is 
conspicuous by its absence from the major portion of music 
teaching. Undoubtedly there are schools and private teachers
-P-A-G-E-624
  622 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
who endeavor to carry out a more or less carefully graded 
scheme of instruction. As a rule, performance, not as. a 
means to an end, but as the end itself, looms up large in the 
sight of both teacher and student; the teacher’s efficiency is 
tested by the facility with which he can make his pupil play 
or sing, and by the brilliancy and showiness of the perform- 
ance. Nerves are strained for the attainment of this end, all 
else being practically lost sight of. The order of growth so 
graphically set forth in scripture, “first the blade, then the ear, 
after that the full corn in the ear,” has no place in the gen- 
eral scheme of music education. 
In general education conditions are very different. It is 
true that our system of public school instruction is under hot 
fire at this time, and certainly, if current criticism contains 
even a modicum of truth, it is not free from weakness, nor has 
it succeeded in producing entirely satisfactory results. But, 
whatever else may be laid to its charge, the modern school 
system is free from the fault of inattention to the develop- 
ment of a complete and properly graded scheme of instruction. 
Great care has been bestowed on the grading of instruction in 
the various subjects of the curriculum, from the most ele- 
mentary through secondary schools to the college and univer- 
sity. From the first day of the child’s entrance into the pri- 
mary room to the moment when he receives, as the reward of 
years of patient and continuous adherence to a definite scheme 
of instruction, the diploma, the emblem of his preparation for 
entrance into the real work of life, his course of study, its ar- 
rangement of subjects, the time devoted to each, the correla- 
tion of each subject with others, are matters to which pains- 
taking thought has been given. Those of us who have observed 
the workings of the public schools know how many are the 
methods of teaching elementary subjects that have been pro- 
posed, tested, and retained or rejected, according as the con- 
sensus of pedagogic opinion has approved or condemned 
them. We know that there is a continual search not only for 
better methods of instruction, but also for more effective group- 
ings of subjects, effort to discover where emphasis should be 
placed, and a constant attempt more perfectly to articulate 
the different grades. 
Whether this attention and these efforts have, as yet, been
-P-A-G-E-625
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 623 
successful in evolving courses of instruction best suited to 
true educational needs, is not germane to the point at issue, 
which is that elementary training, proper grading, and perfect 
articulation of courses is vital, and that earnest and sustained 
efforts for their attainment have been, and still are, being 
made. We know that in music education there is no con- 
certed attempt to attain such results. Failure to act on so 
sound a pedagogic principle is evident, and the question pre- 
sents itself. Why this failure? Is the subject—music—at 
fault? Are there no competent musical pedagogs? We who 
are familiar with the subject promptly answer, the trouble 
does not arise from any weakness in music as a subject for 
educational development, nor in a lack of pedagogic ability on 
the part of those who teach it. The fault must be sought for 
in other quarters. If I might characterize it by name, I 
would call it the individual note. 
The history of music education is a record of the movements 
of segregated units. It reveals the progress of rivulets, at 
times, perhaps, approaching each other, but never combining 
in sufficient numbers to form a Stream of ever-increasing depth, 
breadth and power. Isolated, working without reference to 
the good of the whole, with no central principle toward which 
their activities may converge, the force exerted by these units 
has been centrifugal, flinging off schemes and methods in de- 
sultory fashion and dissipating their strength in misdirected 
effort. Attempts have not been wanting, however, to make 
these units coalesce; there have been earnest students of the 
problem of music education who have realized the futility of 
the labors of these dispersed units. The Music Teachers’ Na- 
tional Association, striving for over thirty years to combine 
the music teachers of this country into a homogeneous body, 
is a witness not only of such segregation, but also to its evil 
effects. The comparative failure of its efforts emphasizes the 
individual note. Egoism rules, and the great majority of the 
music teachers of the country view with indifference and even 
positive suspicion all movements which, fusing them into a 
united body, may soften the individual note and lessen in 
some measure their personal importance in the eyes of their 
constiuency. In making this statement, there is no intention 
of impugning the sincerity of music teachers as a whole or of 
 
-P-A-G-E-626

underestimating the benefit to be derived from their labors. 
Indeed, absorption in their own work and a desire to produce 
results according to their own conception of what is good, 
are frequently the causes of their indifference and antagonism. 
This, however, only gives added volume to the individual 
note, and the sincerity of their purpose and the beneficent 
effect of their individual influence do not offset the disintegrat- 
ing effect of their educational isolation. The note is heard 
with equal insistence among institutions engaged in music 
education. Among these, also, are many which are earnest in 
their efforts to provide effective courses of study and faith- 
fully to carry out their provisions, but the absence of united 
effort and the wide variations of standards are evident. There 
is in many of them also a more or less subdued tone of intoler- 
ance of the ideas and opinions of others, which swells the in- 
dividual note with an unpleasant crescendo, and emphasizes 
the need of some force with power to quiet the individual note 
and gather the units into an organic whole. 
Whence is this force to come? is the question confronting 
us today. And here we may find suggestion in the operations 
of our general educational system. Its unity has been men- 
tioned. The movement toward this unity had its origin not 
so much in the lower grades as in the demand made upon 
these lower grades from above. Institutions of higher educa- 
tion have fixed standards and are dictating entrance require- 
ments, demanding of secondary schools that their students 
shall be prepared to meet these requirements. Associations of 
colleges are being formed to unite in determinig definite and 
uniform standards of scholarship, and in agreeing to insist 
upon their maintenance. Professors of secondary education 
are being appointed whose business it is to study conditions, 
to recommend what steps should be taken for the improvement 
of conditions, and to bring about uniformity of standards. 
College presidents and college professors are interesting 
themselves in these matters, and are pledging themselves to 
the support of the movement. Thus a force is at work unify- 
ing the elements of education, producing coherence in its va- 
rious ramifications, and amalgamating the activities of pri- 
vate teachers and schools, secondary schools, and higher in- 
stitutions, and practically forcing the promulgation of a sys-
-P-A-G-E-627
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 625 
tematic and logically constructed scheme of instruction which 
shall be progressive from beginning to end, the initiative, it 
should be noted, coming from the higher grade institutions 
and reaching down to the lower. 
The inference to be drawn is clear. Similar methods of 
procedure must be inaugurated if music is to be logically de- 
veloped. This department, if animated by a sincere desire to 
improve musical conditions and properly organized, can do 
yeoman service in standardizing music education. It is clear 
that the remedy for the conditions I have briefly outlined lies 
in formally organized music education. This, at present, is in 
the hands of institutions of higher education, secondary 
schools and the lower grades of the public school. To these I 
would add organized private teaching. As matters now 
stand, from the multitude of private teachers, amenable to no 
one but themselves and those patrons whose knowledge of 
musical values is too slight to exert an appreciable influence, 
no help may be expected, although there are many who realize 
the need for better elementary training and a more compre- 
hensive grasp on the part of students of the essentials of 
musicianship, and are doing what they can to supply in their 
own teaching the deficiency. 
In view of these facts, I recommend the full and free discus- 
sion of this question and the thorough organization of this 
department for the work of improvement. We should make 
every effort to include in owr numbers all present forms of 
organized music education and the many unorganized private 
teachers who are now laboring as irresponsible units. In 
order that we may set about the work intelligently, I suggest 
the appointment of committees representative of each division, 
whose duty it shall be to investigate conditions, securing data 
which will be a basis for future action, and report at the next 
meeting of the department, making such suggestions as are 
pertinent. I suggest, therefore, the appointment of the fol- 
lowing committees: A committee of ten from departments of 
- music in colleges, a committee of the same number from 
the public schools, and a committee of the same number from 
the body of private teachers. These committees should se- 
cure information concerning courses of study, methods of in-

struction, and, as far as possible, the standards maintained 
in their respective fields of investigation. 
I am well aware that the policy I propose presents difficul- 
ties of no small proportions. There are obstacles to be sur- 
mounted, and a careful consideration of all phases of the 
problem, judgment in arriving at conclusions, and prudence 
in taking forward steps will be necessary, but determination 
and patience will be productive of results that cannot fail of 
beneficent effects. The consummation of this policy will re- 
quire an enthusiasm that does not falter under discourage- 
ment, and, above all, a sincere desire to improve the standards 
of music education throughout the section over which our 
jurisdiction extends. 
INSTRUCTION IN MUSIC IN GRAMMAR GRADES. 
PROF, FRANK L. BRISTOW, COVINGTON, KY. 
As an introduction to my theme, “What subjects should 
be included in the music grades, and upon what subjects 
should particular stress be placed?” please permit me to in- 
troduce myself to you as the son of a South Carolina mother 
and a Kentucky father, and to sing for you the tremulous 
thanksgiving song of an old man who has reached the age of 
three-score years and ten. One who long, long ago learned 
by note the natural scale of infancy, which may be termed the 
high-treble or soprano time of human life. Who has lived and 
loved the joyous gamuts of boyhood, life’s dreamy alto time; 
and battled with life’s tenor, the chromatic scale of manhood, 
with its ups and downs, sharps and flats; and one who is now 
softly humming the descending minor scale of old age, to its 
authentic cadence, the sombre basso profundo tempo of human 
existence. 
Having thus attuned myself to your respectful attention, I 
also request that you suffer an old man, who has devoted fifty 
out of seventy years to teaching vocal and instrumental music 
in all their branches, to make an apology for not appearing 
before you in the conventional style of dress and “Paderew- 
skian” shock of hair peculiar to the common run of “modern 
music masters,” so-called. Charles Dickens, the greatest (in 
my humble opinion) of all great English writers, truly says 
that “Plainness and simplicity are the soul of elegance.” Not-

JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGS. 627 
withstanding the fact that I have passed, by ten years, the 
chloroform age of Oslerism when I should be silenced, I am 
here before this assembly of literary sons and daughters of 
the cultured Southland to speak plain, simple, practical words 
upon the subject of music, a subject so comprehensive as to 
include within its scope all other subjects of interest, not only 
to teachers, but to mankind in general. The outward appear 
ance of every school building in our land should be such as to 
preclude the necessity of having chiseled upon its frontispiece 
the words, “kindergarten,” “primary,” “grammar,” “inter- 
mediate” and “high” to designate their uses. Within the school 
building the rythmic arrangements of the halls, the rooms, the 
forms, the picture hangings, etc., should be as musical, simple 
and plain, and thus grandly elegant, as were the “morning 
stars” when they were arranged in order, to sing their first 
choral of -satisfaction at the wave of the Omnipotent baton 
wielded by their Great Conductor, Jehovah. The entrance of 
the teachers and pupils into the school rooms should always 
be in an unstrained manner, plainly, graceful and symply sys- 
tematic and orderly. Everybody has two plain and simple 
duties to perform in this life. The first duty is to his Creator; 
the second duty is to his fellowman. I can only perform my 
first duty to my unseen Creator by doing my duty to my fellow- 
man. How can I perform my whole duty to my seen fellow- 
man? Simply and plainly by not taking undue advantage of 
his imperfections, weakness and ignorance, by doing to him 
as I would be done by were I in his place. So in life without, 
and life within the school room. The teacher should teach the 
pupil in a manner as plain and simple as he would wish to 
be taught were he in the pupil’s place. An educated (?) negro 
graduate of Fisk University was trying to teach a simple- 
minded old African uncle how to suck a raw egg, and thus 
elaborated his “Booker Washingtonian” instructions: 
“Primo, make an incision in the apex; secundo, make a 
corresponding aperture in the base. Then, finally, apply the 
lips to the orifice at “eye-ther” extremity of the gallinaceus 
fruit, and by the power of suction withdraw the contents.” 
Thereupon the old uncle replied: “Pshaw! Honey, go ’way! 
I des knocks a hole in bofe ends and sucks her froo.” 
But what must be taught is the first question in my theme. 
   
-P-A-G-E-630
    628 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
I reply, plainly and simply, as follows: As a preparation for 
the school day’s work the “morning song should be sung while 
the teacher and pupils are seated. Suppose the following (or 
a similar) appropriate song to be the one selected: 
“God of the morning, at thy voice 
The cheerful sun makes haste to rise, 
And like a giant doth rejoice 
To run his journey thro’ the skies! 
O, like the sun, may I fulfill 
Th’ appointed duty of this day, 
With ready mind and active will 
March on and keep my Heav’nly way!” 
Then all arise and (after taking a good stretch and a full 
breath as a relief from having been seated) sing a State or 
national song of patriotism, such as “America,” “Old Kentucky 
Home,” “Maryland,” etc. Having thus proved that the class can 
sing (some better and some worse than others), then begin the 
music notation lesson. In each grade of the public grammar 
schools the same instruction in musical notation has to be 
given over and over, day after day, until the exercises in the 
charts and in the song books are memorized. The following 
plain and simple fact should always be kept before the mind 
of the pupil, that to sing by note he must learn to do three 
things at one and the same time, viz.: First, to call the name 
of the note; second, to give the sound of the note; third, to 
sound the note its proper length of time. Don’t confound a 
lesson in vocal music with a lesson in instrwmental music. In 
vocal music the names of the notes (the very first thing to be 
taught and learned) are, “do, re, mi, fa, so, la, si (ti), do.” 
These syllables are used simply to fix in the pupil’s memory the 
tune called the scale. After it is learned as written above in- 
sist upon the pupil’s learning to hum the tune in unison; then 
to vocalize it to the vowel sounds, “ah! 0, e, 4, 00, i,” ete., 
and lastly, to sing the scale without using the consonants, 
thus, “6, a, 6, 4, 6, 4, e, 5.” Next, the names of the notes are 
determined by their position upon the “five lines and four 
spaces” called the staff. “Do,” the first one to be found, deter- 
mining the names of all the other notes. Next, how long to 
make the musical sounds is only determined by the shape 
(“looks”) of the notes, called, whole, half, quarter, eighth, six- 
teenth, etc. To conclude, thoroughly knowing the names
-P-A-G-E-631
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 629 
of the notes, being able to give each note its proper sound, and 
being able to “sound it” the proper length of time, the pupil 
knows as much about the plain, simple and practical part of 
music notation as the teacher himself. And now, finally, 
brethren and sisters, in answer to the second question of my 
theme, “Upon what subjects should particular stress be 
placed?” I plainly and simply say, “Upon every one;” merely 
using the mark of syncopation upon the subject of time, for 
music without rythmic flow is only noise. 
HOW MUCH INSTRUCTION IN MUSIC SHOULD BE 
GIVEN BY GRADE AND SPECIAL TEACHERS 
IN THE GRAMMAR GRADES? 
WINIFRED M. SHUMWAY, HOUSTON, TEXAS. 
Since varying conditions must largely determine the amount 
of work the special teacher of music will be able to do in the 
grammar grades, let us classify the work according to the 
size of the system of schools. In small towns where the special 
teacher visits the rooms every day or every other day there is 
no need of the regular teacher doing any of the music work. 
In the medium-sized towns where the special teacher visits 
each room once a week, the two things to be emphasized in the 
lesson are the presentation of new work and the finishing of 
work already begun. By finishing I mean adding the artistic 
touches. It is for the regular teacher to carry on the work 
begun by the special teacher, to do the drilling on the technical 
and theoretical points, as well as to see that the artistic stand- 
ard of the work is maintained. 
In a system of schools so large that the supervisor can get 
to a room only once a month, practically all of the work must 
be done by the grade teacher. The regular teachers should be 
instructed by the supervisor in grade meetings, and on the 
occasion of the supervisor’s visit to the room the work of the 
month should be inspected, criticized; the strong and the weak 
points shown to the teacher, and help should be given so that 
these difficulties may be overcome. In order that the work 
may be inspected in the most satisfactory way, the regular 
teacher should teach the lesson to show what has been accom- 
plished, and the way in which it has been done, then the super- 
visor is in a position to know just where the teacher needs help.

Perhaps the most expedient method of showing a teacher how 
to overcome her weakness is for the special teacher to take 
the class and demonstrate the points she wishes brought out. 
If the sight singing is poor, the supervisor should use part of 
the lesson period showing the teacher how to improve that 
part of the work by teaching the class for her. 
The province of a supervisor of music in a large system of 
schools is to instruct the teachers in the music work in grade 
meetings, to inspect the work of each class, to teach classes 
for the grade teachers to show them how to become more 
efficient and to strengthen the weak members of the teaching 
force. It is always the business of the supervisor to see that 
a sane balance between the art and the science of the subject 
is maintained. Because of her musical ability and experience, 
the special teacher is better fitted to deal with the art side 
than is the regular grade teacher. Therefore, much of the 
science or theoretical part is left to the grade teacher. 
In large systems of schools the plan of having departmental 
music teachers is a most satisfactory one. It stands to reason 
that a teacher with a good voice, correct ear and musical 
ability will be able to teach music better than one who has not 
these qualifications. 
It is a decided advantage to the teacher of grammar grade 
music to know the work that has been done in the fourth, fifth 
and sixth grades as a foundation for the work of the upper 
grades and to know the ability and musical experience of each 
individual member of the class. 
Where it is possible for the supervisor to make only oc- 
casional visits to the rooms, a competent music teacher should 
have regular charge of the work in each building. In the upper 
grades especially is this necessary. 
To sum up the matter and answer the question briefly, the 
following statement will be sufficient: As much of the music 
work in the grammar grade as possible should be done by the 
special music teacher. 
WHAT FORM SHOULD MUSIC INSTRUCTION TAKE IN 
THE HIGH SCHOOL? 
MARGARET M. BOYLAN, NORTH TEXAS STATH NORMAL COLLNGH. 
That music should be taught in the public schools is a fore- 
gone conclusion. History, primitive races extant, the child,
-P-A-G-E-633
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 631 
and our own experiences prove to us that music is innate in 
the human race. Education, a process of soul development, 
demands a development of all the powers, and not the least of 
these is the power of expressing one’s emotions through the 
medium of tone. Music, as the language of the emotions, gives 
us a medium of expression which nothing else can duplicate, 
and since education depends upon the degree with which we are 
able to understand, feel and express, the importance of music 
is evident. 
I take it for granted that the high school I am to consider 
is one composed of pupils who have had previous training in 
the grades, and that anything which increases the knowledge 
of music will be considered as instruction. It seems that the 
ultimate aim in view is to make of the pupils independent sight 
readers and good singers; to give them a standard by which 
to judge the merit of the music they hear; and to inspire them 
with a love and appreciation for all that is true and beautiful 
in the world of music. A review of the mechanics or rudiments 
is necessary, just to what extent depends upon the previous 
training. It may be the careful analysis of certain songs will 
be sufficient to keep before them the numerous problems in 
rhythm, melody and harmony, which constantly arise in cherus 
practice. 
The teacher must be the judge, and plan drills necessary 
for efficiency in the work. Nothing to my mind is more effec- 
tive in making the mechanics of music a permanent asset, than 
experience in the use of the symbols through the writing of 
music. This not only fixes the mechanics in the mind, but is 
excellent drill for a mastery of tonality. The idea of using 
tones in an original way for expressing one’s thoughts sheuld 
be encouraged and required from the beginning. Original 
work is required as the final test in everything else, why not in 
music? If this avenue of expression is to be kept open it must 
be used. ry 
The high school pupils should be so trained in the use of 
tone symbols and their effects that a page of music could be 
written with as great freedom as a page of English. Since most 
high schools are allowed some elective subjects, I would sug- 
gest that a course in harmony and composition be available for 
any who wish to continue the work to greater perfection. Care- 
   
-P-A-G-E-634
  632 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
ful vocal exercises are essential in order to keep the voices in 
good condition, not alone for the best results in public and 
private performances, but for the physical well-being of the 
pupils. 
In order to judge of the merit of what we hear or see, we 
must have experience. Experience no doubt develops taste, 
but taste must be seasoned with judgment. The music studied 
in the high school should be of such a character that there can 
be no doubt as to its effect in the development of taste, and 
frequent opportunities should be given for testing standards 
by forming judgments. Criticism should be on the basis of 
judgment, not taste. Let them give criticism on character of 
music studied, or that which they are privileged to hear not 
only in school, but on the concert stage, at church, etc. There 
is enough of the good and true and beautiful in music, within 
the ability of pupils of all grades without resorting to the popu- 
lar “stufi” of the day for variety. Variety is essential, but it 
does not necessarily imply good and bad. 
Aside from the general chorus work, special musical organi- 
zations should be encouraged. Vocal clubs of various kinds, an 
orchestra or a band have been the means of keeping many a 
high school boy or girl interested not only in music, but in 
school, until the completion of the course, who would other- 
wise have become imbued with the commercial spirit to such 
an extent that school days would early have become a thing 
of the past. The works to be studied in these clubs will depend 
entirely upon the ability of the clubs in question. There is an 
abundance of material to meet all emergencies, if one is but 
well informed. The culmination of all this drill and rehearsing 
should be at least two concerts a year, one of a miscellaneous 
character, the other a complete work. 
It is very natural and right that most of the music in the 
public schools should be along vocal lines. Nothing else can 
take its place as a means of developing musical ability, but 
I should like to make a plea for better opportunities for hear- 
ing good instrumental music. As a rule, the majority of 
people enjoy vocal music better than instrumental because they 
are not familiar enough with tone effects to interpret for them- 
selves. They seem to get little or nothing out of music, unless 
the interpretation is given them through the medium of words.
-P-A-G-E-635
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 633 
Words limit the meaning, while he who can interpret tones 
has a much broader field of pleasure and enjoyment before him. 
Browning expresses the wonderful power of tones in his “Abt 
Vogler,’ when he says: 
“And I know not if, save in this, such gift be allowed to man, 
That out of three sounds be frame, not a fourth sound, but a star. 
Consider it well—each tone of our scale in itself is nought; 
It is everywhere in the world—loud, soft, and all is said; 
Give it to me to use! I mix it with two in my thought; 
And, there! Ye have heard and seen; consider and bow the head! 
The high that proved too high, the heroic for each too hard, 
The passion that left the ground to lose itself in the sky, 
Are music sent up to God by the lover and the bard; 
Enough that He heard it once—we shall hear it by and by.” 
There are emotions which cannot be expressed by mere words. 
Then it is that the musician resorts to tones, the artist to his 
brush, and we can feel, but are powerless to express the great- 
ness of it all. When we can express what we feel, we too, are 
artists. Hear the poet’s interpretation of Millet’s “Man With 
the Hoe:” 
“Bowed by the weight of centuries he leans 
Upon his hoe and gazes on the ground, 
The emptiness of ages in his face, 
And on his back the burden of the world.” 
A remarkable pen picture, by Edwin Markham, but how in- 
adequate to express the artist’s touch. The same is true of the 
great dramas, which have been reproduced through tones. “A 
Midsummer Night’s Dream,” for example, by Mendelssohn, ex- 
presses colors and effects impossible even to the versatile Shake- 
speare. 
How aptly Riley expresses this thought in his “Scrawl,” 
when he says: 
“I want to sing something, but this is all, 
I try and I try, but the rhymes are dull 
As though they were damp, and the echoes fall 
Limp and unlovable. 
Words will not say what I yearn to say, 
They will not walk as I want them to 
But stumble and fall in the path of the way 
Of my telling my love for you.
-P-A-G-E-636
634 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Simply take what the scrawl is worth, 
Knowing I love you as sun the sod 
On the ripening fields of the great round earth, 
That swings in the smile of God.” 
Baby’s letter to papa—a scrawl to be sure—expresses more 
than he can say in words, yet how much the fond father can 
read into it. 
Sydney Lanier surely knew the limitations of spoken lan- 
guage when he said: ‘Music is love in search of a word’—- 
love so great that no definite words could express it. 
The history of music, I think, should be of a very practical 
nature. In reviewing the rudiments, the origin of the symbols, 
terms, etc., would add interest to the work. “History in a page 
of music,” would be an ideal way of summarizing such a course. 
A sketch of the life of each composer as his works are studied 
will help keep up the interest, or if time permits, a study of 
these men according to the different schools or countries they 
represent. 
The origin and subsequent development of each instrument 
in the orchestra or band, and the life history of the greatest 
players on these instruments, or the great leaders of such or- 
ganizations, will involve time well spent. If time could be 
given to such a course, a thorough study of the history of music 
would do much toward ennobling the art in the minds of the 
pupils, for no greater nor grander men have ever lived than 
the “fathers of music.” As much, if not more, good would re- 
sult from the study of the lives of these men as of any other 
heroes in the development of civilization. 
The study of the history of music brings us to another very 
important feature of the work, not only in relation to the high 
school, but in the grades as well—the use of the automatic 
musical instruments. They are the greatest inventions of the 
age for placing before the student of history and biography 
what the great artists and composers have done and are doing. 
They place within the reach of all an objective lesson in the 
development of music. 
In no other way can the students be afforded so many oppor- 
tunities for hearing good music, and since in most cases taste 
is a matter of experience, the taste for good music is developed 
in proportion to the amount of good music one hears. It gives 
 
-P-A-G-E-637
  JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGE. 635 
to all a chance to hear the great artists every day and the effect 
upon the development of the appreciation of good music can- 
not be measured. 
To summarize, instruction in music in the high school should 
include all that will prepare the pupils for more complete liv- 
ing. What we plan may seem beyond some of them, but 
“Our reach should exceed our grasp, 
Or what’s a heaven for.” 
Some are going out from the school room never to enter it 
again, and if we can do even a little to help them understand, 
love and appreciate music, it will enable them to write a more 
nearly perfect life song, for 
“Our lives are songs, God writes the words, 
And we set them to music at pleasure; 
And the song may be glad or sweet or sad, 
As we choose to fashion the measure— 
We must write the music, whatever the words, 
Whatever the rhyme or the meter, 
And if it is sad, we can make it glad, 
Or if sweet, we can make it sweeter.” 
INSTRUCTION IN MUSIC IN THE GRAMMAR GRADES. 
MRS. MAUDE BH. TRUITT, MOBILE, ALA. 
“The law of worthy national life, like the law of worthy individual 
life, is fundamentally the law of strife. 
ste It is only through labor and painful effort, by grim energy 
and resolute courage, that we move on to better things.” 
“We need music in our modern life as much as we need bread; we 
need music in our schools as much as we need the multiplication table ; 
we need music in our church. 
“Music in our schools should not be as a correlated fad, but as a 
factor in national character.”—Elmer E. Brown, Former Commissioner 
of Education. 
Educational associations have always wielded a tremendous 
influence in American education. The same terms should be 
truthfully applied to the music department. There are educa- 
tional requirements, musical and literary, that should be de- 
manded of the music supervisor, and of the grade teacher who 
conducts the music recitation in the absence of the supervisor. 
The work in the future taken up in the department of music 
education of the associations will have its due influence in 
shaping the development of American school music. The signs
-P-A-G-E-638
636 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
are that there will be abundant evidence of a new spirit, a 
spirit that will make for organized, reasonable, vigorous efforts 
along proper lines. 
Another influence is found in the general educational alert- 
ness of the day. This is an era of educational progress; it 
is a growth and component branch in the course of study. We 
are endeavoring to bring the teaching of music into general 
conformity with other school studies. 
In our making of the program of the music section we have 
endeavored to cover ground as effectually as possible in the 
limited time at our disposal. The work from the standpoint 
of the high school, the grade teacher and supervisor has been 
given careful attention. We have endeavored to make a frank 
inventory of our own personal equation, and receive the assimi- 
lation from others, of those phases which our own seem to lack 
that we may round out our own into something approaching 
the contour of completeness. 
To me it has never been a drudgery in teaching. It should 
be a pleasure to try and mould those under our care according 
to our own lights and revelations. Teaching has been and 
should ever be a stimulus and inspiration. 
The education of the young, the solicitous cherishing of the 
tender plant of knowledge, is a very human subject, and while 
the education of today, the viewpoint of modern teaching, is 
different from the régime under which we received our train- 
ing even ten or fifteen years ago, it is very’ difficult for the 
general public to know and appreciate the modern trend of 
thought unless closely in touch with all that pertains to it. 
The real “natural” education is that aimed at in the best 
endeavor of today, in which the child, from the moment of his 
birth, is steadily, rationally and intellectually developed by 
trained and systematic minds toward the best manhood pos- 
sible to him. 
It is now the consensus of opinion that music has a genuine 
value as an element in education, and might be made more. It 
is gratifying to know that about seventeen million children are 
being instructed in school music by the teachers of the United 
States. Many a gifted and noted singer has found his incen- 
tive to a musical career in the elementary schools. Infiuences 
are at work that are far-reaching in the development of the
-P-A-G-E-639
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 637 
child. The trend of thought of our present century, according 
to the individual viewpoint differs; but we all unite and agree 
on essential in the main. 
Possibly an attempt to secure an agreement as to method and 
a definite course of study at this time may be futile, still there 
should be an agreement along general lines. Some lay too 
much stress on the technical side and not sufficient emphasis 
on the aesthetic and cultural. However much we may differ, it 
should be agreed that the subject of music should be so pre- 
sented to the children of the grammar schools as to develop a 
love of music, a sensitiveness to and an appreciation of the 
great works of art, and have some knowledge of music history 
and biography and read music readily. The study of the 
technical side can be so presented to the child as to destroy 
all sense of and interest in the art side, but in any scheme of 
music education neither the art nor the science can be ignored. 
We must take the two phases of the work and combine them. 
The great human interest in the art side of the subject must 
be as a means to an end—that of good reading. If we could 
bring to our children a knowledge of the great and big things 
in music through the aid of the mechanical piano player it 
would be a good thing. Possibly that is also one of the things 
of the future. There must, however, be in the grammar grades 
a mastery of the mechanical, technical principles before there 
can be any artistic freedom. 
The new education demands that the teacher must first know 
the subject in all its details, and more than all should know 
the child, thus being qualified to lead him into a direct desire 
to know more and more as each step is open before him. In 
teaching you must simply work your pupil into such a state 
of interest in what you are going to teach him that every other 
object of attention is banished from his mind; then reveal it 
to him so impressively that he will remember the occasion to 
his dying day; and finally will fill him with devouring curiosity 
to know what the next steps in connection with the subject 
are. 
No other branch of education requires a more comprehensive 
training of all of the faculties as music. Eye, ear, memory, the 
perceptive and analytical faculties, the imagination and the 
emotional sensibilities are deeply involved. The first begin-
-P-A-G-E-640
688 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
nings of musical education should be ear training, developing 
the sense of pitch rhythm and the sense of tone quality. The 
key note of the teaching of this century is the training of the 
eye to hear, and the ear to see the reverse of nature. There are 
very few children but what can eo the sense of both rela- 
tive pitch and rhythm. 
Singing, like dancing, is the natural expression of a musical 
nature and everybody, though not always intended for soloists, 
can learn the fundamental principles of phrasing and expres- 
sion so as to make his voice the proper vehicle of smooth sound 
in the making of simple melody and other form of instruction. 
Children should receive the same training in melodic structure 
that they receive in word language and language structure. 
Their ability to construct melodies would keep pace with their 
ability to construct the English language. From the tonal 
content of a child’s mind he expresses his thought in melody. 
Then briefly, at the end of the grammar school stage pupils 
should be able: 
I. To sing musically and with evident intelligence; that is, 
1. With artistic method, requiring such features as (a) agree- 
able tone, implying breath-control; (b) correct phrasing; (c) 
feeling for the spirit, tempo and character of the song, imply- 
ing knowledge of the common marks and terms by which these 
are suggested. 2. With evidence of some acquaintance with 
good music, vocal and instrumental, because they have mem- 
orized a large number of song-gems and have associated with 
many examples of the story of their origin. 
II. To sing at sight and handle the rudiments of musical 
structure; that is, 1. With ability to read (a) a part in a 
three or four-part tune, such as one by Dykes, Barnby or Sul- 
livan; (b) eight-measure melodies. The tests should show a 
knowledge (1) of all time-signatures, with the use of one, two, 
three or four tones to the beat, unequally divided beats, and 
syncopation; and (2) of all key-signatures, major and minor, 
with either the F-clef or the G-clef, and also the signs for 
chromatic tones. 2. With ability to write in staff notation 
from dictation a simple melody. The tests should show the 
power to analyze what is heard (1) as to the union of division 
of beats, (2) as to the grouping of beats into measure-patterns, 
and (8) as to the pitch-relationships in the key, major or minor. 
 
-P-A-G-E-641
JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGS. 639 
Signs, major and minor, made either in G or F-clef be able 
to write from simple dictation that which he hears. 
Some may differ as to the requirements, as there is no well- 
defined goal for music in public education as there are in the 
older subjects, yet splendid results have been accomplished in 
many places. There is a better system, better teaching and a 
higher aim. The systematic study of the pedagogy of music 
that has taken place all over the country is bearing fruitage. 
The subject is so youthful in education and with such wide 
diversity of method that we must expect a divergence in re- 
sults. 
Popular education tends to a recognition of every subject 
of instruction at due valuation. So that it seems to me that 
with school music we are dealing with the very breath of edu- 
cation, without music all else is unquickened. We send the 
youth out into life, there is more of him—he is not only 
polished a little brighter in one spot, but he is alive, farther 
in music’s power, it seems to me, to lie in the deep stimulation 
of the individuality. 
Let us then make a correlation between literature, history, 
geography, nature study and music so that it will not be 
difficult to vitalize the necessary formal work. Let us not 
think of it as a thing apart from the other studies of the school, 
but as a true factor in education, refining, uplifting, creating 
a better spirit and atmosphere for other subjects and giving us 
an opportunity of showing to children the great life revealing 
side, and at the same time take our stand as educators in the 
biggest sense.

THE EDUCATIONAL AND ECONOMIC VALUE OF 
DRAWING IN THE SCHOOLS. 
ETHEL HUTSON, JACKSON, MISS. 
The biologist will describe to you, and illustrate with draw- 
ings of forms of life, too small to be seen without the micros- 
cope, how the “blob” of jelly that makes up the primitive one- 
celled protozoan develops a partition down its formless middle 
and then splits into two blobs of jelly, each as perfect and as 
lively as the original whole. Curiously enough, in the realm 
of thought, subjects display the same power of splitting them- 
selves into two equally “live” and interesting topics, and these 
again into two, or three, or ten, each quite important enough 
to hold your attention, and the attention of your audience, for 
all the allotted time. 
The subject assigned me is a case in point. For it divides 
itself at once and naturally into two quite separate subjects, 
the educational value of drawing in our schools, and its eco- 
nomic value. Each of these subjects would split if we gave 
them time; but, I assure you, we shall capture them one at a 
time, and dissect them before they have a chance to multiply 
further. They are live subjects, however; probably there is no 
branch of school work which demands, and receives, more eager 
attention and more earnest thought from school men and 
women today than the training of eye and hand by drawing 
and the other arts of design based on drawing. For we have 
at last wakened from the hypnotic trance into which the in- 
vention of printing threw the educated and educating world, 
 
-P-A-G-E-643
  JOURNAL OF PROGEEDINGS. 641 
and we no longer imagine that education consists solely in be- 
ing able to decipher and reproduce verbal and literal symbols. 
It has been a slow awakening, however. For some three hun- 
dred years the civilized world has, Merlin-like, lain under the 
spell of words—spoken or written, but especially written, and 
more especially printed. Fascinated by the marvelous power 
developed by these little symbols, which could overturn thrones, 
banish statesmen, bear wealth and treasure to distant lands, 
heal the sick, bring comfort and the word of salvation to the 
dying sinner, and even carry out the will of a man after his 
death, it was little wonder if men could see no use in studying 
anything but the printed page. 
Education, old as the human race, wise with the wisdom of 
medieval craftsmen, Roman administrator, Greek artist, He- 
brew legislator, Egyptian engineer, Assyrian architect and 
Chaldean astronomer, lay, like the ancient necromancer under 
Vivian’s spells, tranced under the enchantment of the wonder- 
ful new art, which made words and names and symbols of 
words take on a new reality, and seem to be more important 
than the things they stood for. Seem, I say; for we have, 
in this generation, begun to see through the illusion, and to 
cast off the spells of verbal education. We are awakening to 
a sense of the tremendous reality and power of other forms of 
knowledge than knowing the names of things, and how to spell 
them, of other kinds of skill than skill in the manipulation of 
letters and figures, numbers and words. We are even learning 
that there are other languages than those that are spoken and 
written, and that the languages of form and of color, and the 
marvelous language of form and color combined (which we 
call painting), speak more universally to all folk in all ages 
than any known tongue. I cannot read Italian, nor under- 
stand it spoken; but Italian painters who lived from four to 
five hundred years ago have told me hundreds of wonderful 
stories—have told me how the folk they knew looked and 
dressed and acted, loved and hated, and what they thought of 
God and heaven and hell. 
Dutch is an unknown tongue to me, and no doubt to you as 
well; but a needle and some acid have enabled us to know how 
one Dutchman, Rembrandt Von Rhyn, loved his good and 
lovely mother, and how he saw, in the Jews of Amsterdam’s 
41

Ghetto, likenesses of Moses, David and the Nazarene. Marcus 
Aurelius survives to us not less surely and vividly in the noble 
portrait statue of him, which sits in the house on the Capi- 
toline Hill, than in his lofty maxims. Chaldean ruler and 
Egyptian Pharaoh hunt lions and wild boars, punish enemies 
and reward loyal subjects, on the painted tile or carven stone 
their artists wrought, and we who cannot read a hieroglyph 
nor decipher a single brick of a cuneiform inscription may 
thrill with the excitement of a hunt or a battle six thousand 
years old. 
We hear much nowadays of the need of culture-subjects in 
education, for the pendulum that in the last quarter of the 
nineteenth century swung so far toward utilitarianism as to 
push “the humanities” almost out of the curriculum, has in 
the first quarter of the twentieth century begun to swing surely 
back, and to bring into prominence again every subject of 
human thought and activity that tends to broaden and to 
civilize, to illuminate and to soften. 
We have learned that it is quite as necessary and important 
to teach boys and girls how to live as how to earn a living. 
We have realized that it is the way a man or a woman spends 
the leisure hours, outside of workaday tasks, that make the 
difference between lives well-spent and happy and beneficent, 
and those which are wretched and harmful. We see that the 
basis for a well-spent leisure lies in the culture of seeds sown 
in the earliest years. 
So, with the new psychology, and the new view of the duty 
of the community toward every life that springs up within 
it, has come a new importance for culture-subjects. And surely 
of all culture-subjects there is none which so deserves to be 
called head and chief as drawing does. Even reading does not 
more surely put us in touch with human thought and ex- 
perience, with the past and with the race in its entirety, from 
savage Hottentot to cultured Greek, than do the arts of de- 
sign, the oldest of all the “humanities,” through which we get 
knowledge of earliest times, distant lands and alien peoples. 
But knowledge is only one part of education. Skill is an- 
other part, equally important, and for the majority of men 
more important than knowledge. More men fail in life from 
lack of skill, lack of the trained eye and the trained hand, than
-P-A-G-E-645
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 6438 
from lack of information. And it is in the training of eye 
and hand that drawing and the arts that spring from it stand 
preéminent. 
Skill—it is skill that puts joy into labor, that transforms 
drudgery into a pleasure more intense than that of the most 
absorbing game. Since Adam’s day the mass of mankind have 
labored under the curse which doomed him to toil. Only the 
artist, whether he be painter or sculptor, poet, fiddler or chef, 
evades the doom by choosing a task which his skill and his de- 
light in the exercise of skill makes light and pleasant, though 
the actual labor involved may be as strenuous as that of the 
plowman or the stonebreaker. 
Now, drawing is the art that of all arts is most fundamental 
in its application, most characteristically skill-producing. It 
lies at the basis of all the other arts of design. Sculptor, archi- 
tect, painter, metalworker, weaver, illustrator, potter—all these 
need the aid of drawing in the planning if not in the execution 
of their work. It is as fundamental to all these arts and to 
many more, to almost all the industries, and to the majority 
of the sciences, as reading and writing are to all these varied 
activities, or arithmetic. And its place in the curriculum 
should be exactly parallel to that of these other fundamental 
studies. Drawing is no longer considered, nor should it now 
be taught, merely as an accomplishment for young ladies; but 
as a necessary part of every boy’s and every girl’s education, 
just as necessary as reading, writing and arithmetic. For we 
are rapidly drawing near the point where it will be considered 
as disgraceful for a boy or a girl to grow up without learning 
to draw as to grow up without learning to read; when incor- 
rect perspective will be as offensive to the educated eye as in- 
correct spelling; when the teacher, lecturer or other public 
speaker who cannot illustrate his meaning by a few chalk 
lines will be as poorly equipped as he who cannot write; when 
the student in any advanced scientific work who cannot make 
accurate drawings of his specimens will be considered as im- 
perfectly prepared to carry on his work as if he were unable to 
make written notes. 
We are learning, you see, that the biologist needs to be able 
to draw the forms of the plant or animal he is studying, whether 
with the microscope or with the naked eye; that the astron- 
 
-P-A-G-E-646

omer, the geologist, the geographer, need the same universal 
art. The engineering sciences, from architects on, all require 
it; the manufacturing industries all demand it. No one makes 
a carpet, lays a tiled floor, builds a house, a table, a chair, a 
chest, without having a pattern drawn by some one. The 
clothes you have on, the fabrics of which they are made, the 
jewelry you wear, each was designed on paper first, by some 
one who could draw. And then there is the vast field of illus- 
tration, of books and magazines and newspapers; in each 
branch of this important line of human activity the knowledge 
of form and the skill to reproduce it in lines and tones is the 
essential equipment necessary. Vast, indeed has been the de- 
velopment of this art within the memory of those who are not 
yet middle-aged. Photography, which, it was freely predicted 
a generation ago, would make a knowledge of drawing unneces- 
sary, has only multiplied the uses of the art, by expanding the 
field of illustration a hundred-thousand-fold. 
Three hundred years ago it was no disgrace not to be able 
to read or to write. The solid fighting man looked down upon 
the clerky scribe who had those accomplishments, much as 
the solid business man of a generation ago looked down upon 
the man who could draw. You remember Lord Angus 
Douglas’ boast: 
“Thanks to St. Bothan, son of mine, 
Save Gawain, ne’er could pen a line.” 
And no doubt the observant contemporaries of Gutenberg 
predicted that the new art of printing would cause a great 
falling off in the number of boys which would in the future 
be trained to write, since printed books would do away with 
the need for manuscript copying. But more boys have learned 
to write each year since Guttenberg’s day, just as more have 
learned to draw since photo-engraving has made the reproduc- 
tion of drawings easy. 
We have drifted, you see, into the second division of our 
subject—the economic value of drawing. It is barely possible 
that those who assigned the subject may have guessed that 
this would certainly happen, and that the educational and 
economic values would prove to be so interwoven that any full 
discussion of the one would include the other. But there is 
  
=
-P-A-G-E-647
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 645 
one point among the many that could be mentioned which 
make drawing preéminently valuable from an economic stand- 
point) which we of the South need to bear in mind. We have 
in the Southern States an immense amount of undeveloped 
wealth. Here in Texas, as with us in Mississippi, there are 
millions to be made from our clays alone, for some of the finest 
clays in the world have been found in these two States. But 
it would be very unprofitable for us to mine and ship these 
clays as raw material, as South Carolina and other States 
have done; and not much more profitable for us to import 
skilled workers and utilize all this superlatively excellent ma- 
terial in the manufacture of hotel dishes and floor tile and 
sanitary ware, as Indiana, Ohio and New Jersey have done. 
For our distances are great and freight rates high. To ship 
material of little intrinsic value, or articles which would bring 
a low price wherever sold, and have to meet the competition of 
industries already established, would not be worth while. 
But this same clay, made into artistic ware, like that of the 
Newcomb Pottery in New Orleans, or the Rookwood Pottery 
in Cincinnati, or of the Sévres Pottery in France, would bring 
in ten to a hundred times as much for each piece of ware, 
while the cost of manufacturing and the cost of shipping 
would be only slightly increased. Moreover, articles of skill 
and taste are salable in practically any market—there is none 
of the competition that eliminates profits in so many lines of 
manufactures. This is why, we are told, French industries 
flourish, though the prices that are asked for articles “made 
in France” are almost always high. French artisans do not 
need to underbid; they oversell by the superior taste and skill 
of the French designers. 
And the reason for that, the historian tells us, is that Na- 
poleon Bonaparte was “one of these drawing cranks,” who be- 
lieved that every child could and should learn to draw. Being 
a man who liked to put his theories into practice, he ordered 
that drawing should be taught in all the grades of all the 
schools; with the result that France has become a nation of 
artists, and French styles and French designs are copied and 
imitated and purchased everywhere. 
If we are to compete with the industrial organization and 
enterprise of the North and East, it must be by cultivating 
 
-P-A-G-E-648
  646 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
the same sort of supremacy in taste and skill that the French 
have cultivated—a supremacy which has enabled France to 
compete with the industrial organization and enterprise of 
Germany. 
PICTURE STUDY FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THE 
PUBLIC SCHOOL ART LEAGUE. 
MRS, F. W. VOLCH, HOUSTON, TEXAS, 
What is known as “picture study,” now included in the 
Houston public school curriculum and conducted by its 
teachers as other classes on a day’s program, forms part of a 
larger work planned by the Public School Art League, an 
organization whose aim is the encouragement of art culture 
in the public schools. 
Formed in 1900, the league represents the first united effort 
to improve and beautify the daily environs of the school chil- 
dren of this city, thereby creating a standard of good tastes 
and fostering an appreciation for the beautiful. Its action is 
founded on the belief. “that whatever tends to enlarge the 
child tends to make a better citizen, and if it be true that a 
community is equal to the sum of its parts, then whatever 
makes a better citizen must elevate the community. Let the 
children grow up in clean, healthy, beautiful surroundings 
and they in their manhood will demand a clean, healthy and 
beautiful municipality.” 
The general membership of the league is unlimited, is drawn 
from the city at large, meets annually, and has a voice in 
elections; its governing board, composed of men and 
women, consists of a president, two vice-presidents, corre- 
sponding and recording secretaries, treasurer and nine di- 
rectors, who meet monthly to conduct regular business. Here, 
at various times, have been represented commercial interests, 
the medical and educational professions, art, the clergy. To 
those who pioneered the work, complicated as it was by a va- 
viety of considerations, the city is indubitably debtor today. 
By increased membership, which means a larger interest; 
by privileges of authority from the school board, by its own in- 
herent determination and enthusiasm the league represents a 
potent influence; it stands a firm reality, owning hundreds of 
pictures and casts and having thousands of dollars invested.
-P-A-G-E-649
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 647 
While the placing of pictures and casts in the schools was 
the opening wedge to the work, from which sprung the picture 
study, the exhibitions of prints, the crafts, fine arts, art talks 
and lectures given in Houston since the league advent have 
been under its direction and tributary sources toward the ac- 
complishment of its purpose. : 
In the beginning there was no definite plan in the decoration 
of the school walls. As it could, the league bought good pic- 
tures, placing some in each school; but, as schoolrooms mul- 
tiplied and the league’s work took on larger aspects, it was 
apparent that some method would have to be used to simplify 
the work and to satisfy the schools—each one wanting what 
had been given another. The system adopted had been used 
successfully in Boston. A particular school of art—for in- 
stance, German or Dutch or French—placed in a given grade 
in one school, was placed in that grade in all other schools. 
This, as you see, did not obviate the greatest difficulty. So 
the league went a step farther—not only assigning a particu- 
lar school of art to each grade above the third, but putting the 
same picture in each given grade in every school in the city. 
In the primary grades and in the high school the pictures 
are ungraded. In the latter there is among others a collec- 
tion of Copley prints, four original paintings presented by 
the artists, the work of Mrs. E. R. Cherry, Miss Elizabeth 
Spaulding, Miss Noble and Mr. Dawson Watson, beside eight 
sections of the Parthenon Frieze gifts to the school by classes 
graduating. 
This work of selecting and grading the pictures was per- 
formed by a joint committee of six, three of whom represented 
the school, three the league, and on its completion the school 
board announced its willingness to incorporate a study of 
these pictures in the school course. A text-book on the sub- 
ject was compiled by three of the teachers and is generally 
used. 
The pictures chosen and the grades to which they were as- 
signed follow: 
L. 1. Study of Cats (Lambert), Madonna of the Arbor 
(Bounret), Baby Stuart (Van Dyck). 
H. 1. The First Step (Millet), Arrival of the Shepherds 
(Le Rolle), Escaped Cow (Dupré),  
-P-A-G-E-650
  648 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
L. 2. Woman Churning (Millet), Holy Night (Correggio), 
Little Miss Bowles (Reynolds). 
H. 2. The Balloon (Dupré), The Melon Eaters (Murillo), 
The Sower (Millet). 
L. 3. Holy Family (Murillo), Feeding Her Birds (Millet), 
A Distinguished Member of Humane Society (Landseer). 
H. 3. Mother and Daughter (Le Brun), Dignity and Impu- 
dence (Landseer), At the Watering Trough (Bonoirit). 
L 4. Dutch Art. The Windmill (Raysdael), The Night 
Watch (Rembrandt), Sheep (Mauve). 
H. 4. German Art. Halt in the Desert (Shreyer), Flight 
into Egypt (Durer), A Battle in the Desert (Shreyer). 
L. 5. French Art. The Horse Fair (Bonheur), Landscape 
(Corat), Shepherdess Knitting (Millet). 
H. 5. French Art. The Song of the Lark (Breton), The 
Shepherdess (Le Rolle), The Gleaners (Millet). 
L. 6. Italian Art. Madonna of the Chair (Raphael), Sing- 
ing Boys, cast (Della Robbin), St. Christopher (Titian). 
H. 6. Italian Art. Sistine Madonna (Raphael), Aurora 
(Guido Reni), David (Michaelangelo). 
L. 7. English Art. Monarch of the Glen (Landseer), Sir 
Galahad (Watts), The Strawberry Girl (Reynolds). 
H. 7th. American Art. Pilgrim Exiles (Boughton), 
Flight of Night (Hunt), Frieze of the Prophets (Sargent). 
Children seeing and studying these works of art in the 
schoolroom have been known to look for the originals while 
visiting in museums, exclaiming with delight on finding any. 
Their interest is keen, their pleasure wholesome. They feel 
something like a personal friendship for the picture and the 
man who made it. As far as they are able, it is their own. 
The difference, after all, as you know, being one of degree. 
Valuation of pictures and casts owned by the Public School 
Art League and the amount expended for lectures, entertain- 
ments, linting of walls, ete., by this association from its or- 
ganization to the present time approximates twelve thousand 
dollars. 
To bring the cost of pictures and casts purchased to the 
dealers’ value, 40 per cent for import duty should be added to 
the purchase price. As these were for educational purposes, 
free entry was allowed by the government.

PICTURE STUDY IN THE HOUSTON PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
MISS GENEVIEVE JOHNSTON, HOUSTON, TEXAS, 
Among the many helpful agencies that have coéperated with 
the Houston teacher in the training and developing of child 
life, the Public School Art League occupies a prominent place. 
At a joint meeting of committees from the league and the 
teachers, the present course of picture study was adopted. 
Excellent reproductions of the chosen pictures have been 
placed in every school by the Art League. It is unfortunate 
that good colored reproductions cannot be obtained, for as 
most of our copies are in brown and black, the symbolism of 
color is lost. 
Much has been done for us, yet in the presentation of a pic- 
ture we are brought to a keen realization of the fact that no 
matter how complete the equipment, there is one thing vitally 
necessary to success, and that is—a teacher. Unless the 
teacher enjoys the work, the pupils benefit little by it. Picture 
study often correlates with other subjects and almost always 
helps in character building. 
All these advantages are apt to tempt the teacher to stray 
away from her appointed task, which is to help her pupils to 
know and to love good pictures without too much regard for 
the moral or literary association that may cluster around. The 
teacher learns really more than the children do. She learns 
from experience that in pictures as in people one is apt to 
find what she looks for; she learns that it is wiser to stress the 
good points. Point out some slight defect and the observer 
may concentrate his attention on that to the neglect of other 
points more worthy of consideration. 
John Singer Sargent’s “Frieze of the Prophets” has been 
selected for discussion before this meeting: (1) Because Mr. 
Sargent is an American; (2) because the frieze is a general 
favorite, although at first glance it does not appear to be a 
picture that would attract a child. 
In presenting this picture before a class some preliminary 
work is done. The subject of American art and artists is dis- 
cussed. Mention is made of such art galleries as the Chicago 
Art Institute, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Metropoli- 
tan Art Museum, and the Corcoran Art Gallery of Washing- 
ton. The children are encouraged to visit these institutions 
 
-P-A-G-E-652
  650 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
that they may see originals. This brings good results, for 
every fall the vacation travelers tell of galleries visited during 
the summer. The subject of mural decoration in America 
brings to our attention several public buildings, such as the 
Congressional Library or the Capitol at Albany, recently de- 
stroyed, and at last we reach the Boston Public Library. 
Many postcards and photographs help the children to get some 
idea of this beautiful building. A short sketch of the life of 
Mr. Sargent with special reference to his preparation for his 
great work is now given. 
A long journey, truly, but we come at last to “The Frieze of 
the Prophets.” The pupils know from the photographs that 
“The Frieze of the Prophets” is a part of the painter’s gigantic 
work, “The Triumph of Religion.” The children turn to look 
curiously at the line of stern old prophets, standing like a 
living wall between them and the barbarism of heathenism. 
The attention readily concentrates on the three central fig- 
ures. A brief review of previous lessons in Sunday school re- 
calls the character and life work of Moses, Joshua and Elijah. 
Moses, developed by years of study, spiritualized by lonely 
meditation and lifted above all men by his intercourse with 
God, stands as the embodiment of law. Those deep-set eyes 
look far beyond the restless changes of humanity to the fixed 
purposes of God—purposes never to be fulfilled until men 
know the law of God and obey it. Never a curve in the com- 
manding figure—how majestic the long straight lines—the 
right angles. Those mysterious wings suggest that back of 
the powerful figure is the divinity that has made this man a 
message. On either side of Moses, standing like dark columns, 
are Joshua and Elisha. In the figure of Joshua the long 
straight folds of the garments, the sheathed sword, the bowed 
head, give a feeling of repose. His work is done. Moses has 
taught the law of God. Joshua has led the people to see that 
theirs is a church militant. The forces of evil must be fought 
and conquered. After the victory comes rest and peace. 
In strong contrast to the reposeful figure of Joshua stands 
the inspired Elijah. With the far-sighted eyes of a prophet 
he has caught the vision of what will be. No rest for him till 
all men see as he sees. His garments are whirled about him 
in careless disorder. His staff is raised, his face is uplifted. 
‘ Every muscle of the enthusiast is strained, every nerve tense.
-P-A-G-E-653
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 651 
Time will not permit the discussion of the other sixteen 
prophets or the wonderful draperies. On the extreme left are 
the so-called prophets of despair—Jephanial, Joel, Obediah 
and the beautiful, hopeful Hosea. Then come Amos, Nahum, 
Ezekiel and Daniel. In the next group the inspired Isaiah 
stands supreme. One prophet of despair is numbered with 
the hopeful figures of the last group. The prophets of hope 
point with outstretched arms to the wall where will be placed 
“Christ preaching to the men” and teaching them of that love 
which is the fulfilling of the law. 
METHODS OF TEACHING DRAWING. 
MISS LOTA TROY, NEW ORLHANS, LA. 
The day when individuals or schools or towns or States 
could work alone has passed. This is seen everywhere we look. 
The change is one of emphasis. Formerly it was individual- 
ism and competition; now it is team work—codperation. Even 
competitors are getting together. They are finding that co- 
operation will accomplish some things that are impossible to 
competition. 
We teachers of art need to get together to exchange expe- 
riences and broaden our outlook. We need still more to con- 
fer with the grade teachers, our competitors in the sense that 
we are each bidding for a larger share of the child’s time. We 
have been “special” teachers too long. We should be “special” 
only in that we give all our time to one thing, not in being set 
apart from the everyday interests of school and home. A 
student once said to me, “Our art teacher is so busy spelling 
art with a capital A that she doesn’t care anything about our 
other interests.” A sweeping statement, but probably not al- 
together undeserved. 
I do not minimize the importance of our own work when I 
say this. Faith in this work is our first need. Doubt and 
pessimism are always the signs of disease, never of growth. 
Faith, joy and enthusiasm are the signs of the creative spirit. 
We believe that the study of art on handicraft is slowly chang- 
ing public ideals in all those environings things which one 
must see, and use, and think about; and we believe that it is 
an influence in the tendency to develop an effective social 
spirit. Yet our loyalty to our own work, and faith in its ulti- 
 
-P-A-G-E-654
  652 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
mate value, does not remove the difficulties which stand in the 
way of the more immediate realization of that value. Proba- 
bly we will all agree that these are limited times, crowded cur- 
ricula, large classes, lack of materials, and sometimes opposi- 
tion of patrons and academic teachers. 
Have we not, within ourselves, the power to solve these 
problems? William James says: “As a rule men habitually 
are only a small part of the powers which they actually pos- 
sess and which they might use under appropriate conditions. 
We see scientific minds bending to the problem of teaching 
the bricklayer how to conserve energy and reduce motion in 
his task, and, therefore, how to double his output and save 
downtear on nerve and muscle. Maximum efficiency with the 
minimum expenditure of time, effort or money is the cry of 
industrial salvation of the day; and the one who studies it, 
practices it, and excells in it, is the one who succeeds best. 
The workman who was formerly able to lay 100 bricks in sixty 
minutes found that he could lay 350 in the same sixty minutes 
with greater financial reward, and actually with less fatigue. 
But somebody worked his head. Frederick Taylor’s labora- 
tory methods were neither easy or simple. Two years of 
experimentation and study made possible the speeding up of 
the bricklayer. 
You will have observed by now that I have the temerity to 
propose scientific management of art methods. There is a 
better and larger way of doing the work in which we are all 
engaged if we can only find it. We often make ten motions 
where we would do as well if we knew the one. We often use 
ten words where one would do as well if we knew the one. 
The conservation of your time and mine is more important 
than that of a bricklayer, not because we are of more value 
than he, but because children are of more value than bricks. 
For, after all, as Hamilton Wright Mabic says, “It’s not the 
material that’s everywhere, it’s us.” People come to the end 
of their material interests, but they never come to the end 
of their spiritual concerns. It is therefore a much solider 
task to minister to spirits than to pile bricks. 
How can we, as art teachers, become more efficient? We 
cannot work harder, for work already fills an immoderate 
part of the life of the earnest teacher, but we can plan our
-P-A-G-E-655
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 653 
work on larger lines and do it with more intelligence. The 
vital defect of the teacher who plans for the day or week in- 
stead of for the decade is that she works like an artisan and 
not like an artist. 
The method used in conserving the energy of teachers and 
pupils involves three things: First, the planning of the work 
asa whole. The successful teacher, like the successful general, 
must see the relation of each move to every other move. 
Second, the complete planning of every lesson involving, not 
only the full knowledge of the operation, but a detailed study 
of how to present it to the class so that it may be performed 
in the least time and with the least effort consistent with its 
greatest educational value and its most complete success. 
Third comes the supervision of the execution of these plans, 
so that not only may the aim of the teacher be accomplished, 
but that intelligent observation may point the way to greater 
success, or less wasted effort, or both. 
The scientific method takes nothing for granted. We must 
start, not with courses of study to be defended, not personal 
opinions to be proved, but with interrogation points. May I 
suggest some of these questions? 
1. How can we codperate more fully with parents and 
grade teachers? You notice I do not say, “How can we secure 
their coéperation?” We know the value of our subject; they 
are not supposed to understand it fully, and “where the knowl- 
edge is there the responsibility rests.” 
2. Can we not give our boys and girls a real motive for 
productive effort? The absence of this motive is the crying 
need of our schools today. We make things because they are 
necessary or of value. Children have a right to object to mak- 
ing artificial problems simply for their educational value, to 
doing things simply because some one says it is good for 
them. 
3. Considering the time and effort expended during the 
eight, ten, or twelve years of public school life, is the technical 
skill and. taste of these boys and girls as great as we should 
expect? If not, why not? 
4, How should we divide the time in the several grades 
between free expression and more formal work in drawing? 
I am not able to answer these questions. I simply suggest
-P-A-G-E-656
  654 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
them as problems which face each of us. You have probably 
thought of many others equally as important. We have no 
Frederick Taylor and Louis Brandies in education to answer 
them for us in an unauthoritative way, but if every teacher 
who is aiming at greater efficiency (and who isn’t) will con- 
tribute the result of her experiments and observations, is it 
not conceivable that we may have a large enough body of facts 
to furnish an answer to some of them? Let us make this 
Round Table a sort of clearing house where we may come 
year after year to sort over these facts and determine those 
methods most worth while. Let us go after the other 250 
bricks and never rest satisfied until we see them laid into an 
orderly erection in our teaching structure. 
SUPERVISION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
MISS IDA BARROW, NEW ORLEANS, LA. 
The task that has been assigned me is rather difficult, since 
the science of supervision, at best, is but an empirical one, 
so I can only put before you those questions that seem to be 
fruitful of discussion, and hope such as follows will throw 
additional light upon the subject. 
A short history of drawing in the New Orleans public 
schools may not come amiss in introducing to you some of 
our problems, which, as far as I have been able to inform 
myself, have been of general significance, during the growth 
of this subject in all localities. 
Some twenty years ago or thereabout, drawing was begun 
with the Eclectic drawing book series as the standard of 
attainment. The perfunctory knowledge of those grade teach- 
ers who knew a little about the subject, or had a “liking for 
it,” was to be the means of attaining this standard; so the 
work was carried on with only the enthusiasm born of neces- 
sity to lend a guiding hand. 
Within a few years the normal and high schools were pro- 
vided with a special teacher, and a step made to increase the 
efficiency of the grade teacher in this line. Soon after this 
important step was accomplished several supervisors were 
placed in charge of groups of primary and grammar schools, 
where each planned and produced independently. This ar- 
rangement continued until the year 1910, when the office of
-P-A-G-E-657
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 655 
chief supervisor was created and the former supervisors be- 
came special teachers. This, perhaps, is the history of drawing 
in many cities. 
The organization of this department has been the outcome 
of a special system, coupled with local conditions and environ- 
ment, and as it differs from that in vogue in other places of 
the same size, it follows that our methods must differ some- 
what, as, also, must some of our problems. 
As it is the duty of the special teacher to give instruction 
directly to the pupil, this new order of things was gladly wel- 
comed by those in the grades, who were thus relieved of all 
responsibility excepting that pertaining to discipline or gen- 
eral helpfulness. 
Other things being equal, it follows that lessons carefully 
thought out and given by trained specialists must result, final- 
ly, in a broader conception of art principles and better techni- 
cal results, and we feel that, in this plan, we have an ideal 
one. 
I shall now mention briefly some of the duties of the super- 
visor. There are first those concerning the machinery of the 
work necessary for its accomplishment. Among these, are the 
making of all kinds of reports, special and general, the organiz- 
ing and ordering of supplies and details concerning class 
instruction. 
Considering the professional side, is the planning of the 
course, relating it to the general course, supervision of class 
instruction, examination of results, criticism, personal in- 
fluence, wide reading, study of systems in other cities, con- 
ferences upon profesional subjects and, perhaps, many others 
I have yet to learn. 
Studying this subject of supervision carefully, and getting 
such light as emanates from those whose long experience gives 
authority, I have considered it as having a four-fold relation 
to school life. 
First, that to the superintendent and any other officers, 
whose policies must be upheld and whose duties are concerned 
with the mental, moral and material welfare of our boys and 
girls. 
Second, that to the special teacher, whose actions and 
methods it inspires and controls.
-P-A-G-E-658

Third, that to the school, represented by that large working 
body, principal, grade teachers and pupils, whose lives we 
aim to make fuller and more complete with a knowledge of 
beauty and some small skill to produce it. 
Fourth, that to the public, whose places in the struggle of 
life we hope to fill with men and women replete with those 
mental and moral characteristics which make for right living. 
Referring back to the first relationship, it is to the superin- 
tendent, as a higher power and one who must be loyally sup- 
ported, that the supervisor must look for assistance in estab- 
lishing her subject on a firm basis. It is needless, almost, to 
say that this assistance must come, not from personal favor, 
but from a conscientious, earnest and successful endeavor to 
plan and conduct her work. 
In relation to the special teacher, the supervisor is especial- 
ly happy when she has the confidence and respect of this body 
of co-workers, for her task is not an easy one—to harmonize 
so many temperaments and preserve unity while not encour- 
aging uniformity. 
To these women, who are giving the best of themselves, of 
thought and training, I consider it only just that their opin- 
ions and knowledge should have weight in planning the course 
of study. This planning means repeated conferences and dis- 
cussions as to how to grade the work and what to expect as 
the outcome. It also means correlation with the general 
course, or, at least, harmony with it. Again, it means re- 
straining the too venturesome spirit, and urging on the too 
timid or apathetic, while always remembering the word of 
encouragement to those whose experience and breadth of mind 
back up their opinions. 
Acquaintance with the best thought in book and lecture 
form along the lines of art, psychology, school management 
and every related subject should be the self-imposed task of 
all concerned in the complete development of the child. 
To the natural student, which a teacher must always be 
to serve her mission ably, the pupil is an ever open book, 
whose pages she must read carefully and with ready sym- 
pathy to do the best in training him for life; for with his 
efficiency as a home-maker and citizen, we are more concerned 
finally than with his ability to draw a flower or make a book.
-P-A-G-E-659

In the third relation, that to the school, we come to the 
strongest and the most diversified, for here there is the princi- 
pal, the grade teacher, the manual training and domestic 
science teacher and the pupil, to each of whom there is due 
some attention and consideration, some help, some guidance. 
As to the principal, the first problem is to interest her in 
what her assistants and pupils are doing and you will have 
her ear in every matter that comes within her domain, and 
she will watch jealously to see that no other school will, for 
any reason, do more than hers. 
In every instance within my experience principals have been 
anxious and willing to receive suggestions concerning decora- 
tion, and as proof of what I say, I could name at least a 
dozen schools where a certain portion of the school fund has 
been put aside or promised for the purchase of casts and 
pottery for beautifying the surroundings or for use in the 
study of form. When you consider that these were the only 
ones approached, it argues well for the whole body in the 
future. : 
With the absence, heretofore, of any accessible public art 
gallery that gives a standard of taste to the masses, it has 
been uphill work to eradicate the influence of vicious posters, 
meretricious calendars and other advertising media. Needless 
to say, the small percentage of good art in these things has 
been engulfed in the immense amount of bad, so that it is no 
wonder that we still occasionally find examples of this per- 
nicious art confronting the children on school walls. Right 
here I owe an apology to art for using the term. 
With something move than the mere power of suggestion, 
which sometimes fails, this small but insistent part of the evil 
could be readily banished. Perhaps, time and school board 
action will come to the rescue. I am told that, in some cities, 
no decoration can be put into the school room without the 
approval of a responsible committee. 
We all know how applied art has taken the whole country 
by storm the last few years, and it is this application to the 
things of life that gives drawing a right to a place on any 
public school curriculum. But how to apply without thorough 
equipment is the problem. Cardboard construction I consider 
one of the excellent means of simple application, but there is 
42

not a sufficient reach out into the home with this only. If we 
talk to the children of proper hangings, we must help them 
to produce some that will take the place of the dreadful gaudy- 
patterned lace curtains with their big ribbon bows which we 
have been deprecating, and this is only one of the many phases 
of the subject. 
Now, I believe it an excellent thing for a teacher to be 
sufficiently resourceful to use whatever is at hand to produce 
something useful and beautiful out of what was useless and 
unbeautiful, but I also think it means too much energy ex- 
pended in devising ways and means of providing materials for 
practical application. In this way is much of her vitality 
consumed, and her teaching power thus deprived of one of its 
strongest assets. 
It sounds delightful to say we have asked the boys to bring 
a piece of wood, an old cigar or soap box, to make a letter 
holder or a picture frame, and lo! there is a thing of beauty 
forthcoming, or as near beauty as good design and neat work 
with makeshift tools can produce; but think of what it means 
to both special and grade teachers to repeatedly remind little 
fellows whose heads are full of play as soon as the school gate 
fades in the distance. Then there is the searching for places 
where things may he had for the asking so necessary in cer- 
tain neighborhoods of large cities where a greater proportion 
of the children come of indigent parents. 
The establishment, at the beginning of this term, of manual 
training and domestic science centers in our city will answer 
this problem of supplies quite happily in the seventh and 
eighth grades, and with the splendid responsiveness of our 
board in the past in meeting such needs, we can hope that no 
item will be left unheeded in the near future. 
But while one problem is being answered so effectively an- 
other may be in the forming, and this one seems to be one for 
discussion over the whole country. 
That the two departments of manual training and drawing 
should be closely allied goes without saying to those who have 
studied the history of these movements, for it is as necessary 
to make a thing on good lines as it is to make it at all. 
The call for -this alliance seemed to be the slogan of the
-P-A-G-E-661
  JOURNAL OF PROOBEDINGS. 659 
Springfield meeting of the Western Drawing and Manual 
Training Association in May, 1911. 
A problem which is the outcome of a system of special in- 
struction seems to connect itself with the grades. Relieved of 
all thought and responsibility in the work beyond the main- 
tenance of discipline or care of material, does the grade teacher 
not lose that vital interest that comes of planning for it and 
bringing those plans to maturity in class-room instruction? 
A good friend to all struggling with public school art and 
with years of experience to his credit (Henry Turner Bailey) 
writes me that “good work in any line is impossible unless 
carried on regularly by the grade teacher.” 
With our short experience it had seemed to us that we had 
done some splendid ‘things and our results seemed to shoot 
up like a beautiful flower. Of course, I must admit that the 
fine subsoil of previous years of practice had been feeding this 
plant, and it needed only organized effort to bring out the 
blossom. 
The rapid growth of some particular lines of our work was 
a reason for congratulation by able and unbiased critics and 
we have felt inwardly proud of our achievement, but may 
there not be a deeper reasoning in what our good friend has 
said? Does not the grade teacher, with all her other subjects 
well in hand and with her constant presence and infiuence over 
the child, reach deeper soil than an occasional visitor can? 
Can she not better strike the keynote of correlation? 
To the pupil belongs our best effort. Everything that we 
do is to have a final test in his mature years and unless we 
have prepared him to do his part well in the world our efforts 
have sadly failed. In training him to do this part, drill is 
one of the strongest factors in character building, yet how 
little of it we can give in the hurried passing from one phase 
of the subject to another in the limited time at our disposal. 
And here we come to our last but not least relationship. 
As it would take quite a time to treat this adequately, I will 
do no more than mention a few points briefly. 
In training young men and women along the lines of good 
taste in home-making, in equipping them to meet their obliga- 
tions to the world at large as factors in its industries, either 
as consumers or producers, in guiding them to make public

sentiment for art, in bringing outside artists to help in this 
guidance through personal contact or works, in lectures, public 
exhibitions and contests, the work of supervision is far-reach- 
ing and endless. Its task is to bring together the needs of 
art and those of the public with them as woof and warp 
weave a beautiful fabric that shall stand the test of art and 
time.

HOUSTON LYCEUM AND CARNEGIE LIBRARY. 
MRS. MARTHA SCHNITZER, HOUSTON, TEXAS, 
This phase of library work which has been assigned to me 
to discuss is still somewhat a problem in our library. In 
Houston (as no doubt everywhere) the need of supplemen- 
tary books, as direct aids in the school work, has become recog- 
nized. The teachers realize that the text-book is merely a
-P-A-G-E-663
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 661 
working guide, and feel the need of fuller sources of informa- 
tion. I believe that wherever libraries codperate with schools 
the supplementary work is conducted on similar lines, with a 
few exceptional features. 
Most of the supplementary aids which we furnish the schools 
are drawn from the general resources of our library, but aside 
from this we have three special collections for supplementing 
the school work. The first collection consists of 137 sets of 
books, suitable for all grades, beginning with the jingle primer, 
including nature stories, biography and history; each set con- 
sists of 40 copies. These books belong to the public schools 
and were originally purchased by the school board, but for 
the past few years it has been the custom of the Houston 
schools to set aside one day in the year, which is known as 
“library day,” when a free-will offering is made by the pupils. 
The proceeds of this collection are used for the purchase of 
additional sets of supplementary readers. The caring for 
and circulating of these books from the library to the class 
room serves as a means of bringing the teachers, some time 
or other, to the library. For I must admit that notwithstand- 
ing the close relation which exists between the school and the 
library there still remain some teachers who would not find 
their way here were it not for the necessity of selecting these 
books. Over 17,000 volumes of supplementary readers were 
circulated during the past school year. 
The second collection consists of beautiful editions of chil- 
dren’s books, illustrated by Kate Greenaway, Maxfield Parrish, 
Arthur Rackham and others; these books were purchased for 
the use of the teachers in primary grades (where “story-tell- 
ing” is a form of instruction), who realize the full value of 
good pictures as a means of better impressing the child with 
the story. 
The third is a picture collection, such as is used in a num- 
ber of libraries; this collection was started only a few months 
ago, but has already proven very useful, especially for the 
teachers in geography and nature study, enabling them to 
make lessons more vivid by showing pictures of the subject 
under study. These pictures are arranged alphabetically ac- 
cording to subject, and are circulated as needed. An interest- 
ing feature of this collection is that the schools coéperated
-P-A-G-E-664
  662 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
with the library in preparing it; most of the pictures were 
mounted by the children of the third grade as part of the con- 
struction work. The result of this work is most gratifying to 
both teachers and library, the former being enthusiastic in 
praise of the benefits derived from these pictures. 
The oceasion of an anniversary or holiday calls forth the 
resourcefulness of the library; as for Thanksgiving Day, books 
on the origin, customs, poems, plays and stories are collected 
and put aside on a separate shelf for the use of the teachers 
and pupils; notice is sent to the teachers, informing them of 
this material, and for a few weeks prior to the day these books 
are in constant demand. 
A new feature recently introduced in the Houston schools 
is the use of the Victor graphophone, the object of this being 
to give the children an opportunity of becoming familiar with 
the best in music. In connection with this the library is called 
upon for collateral reading; we furnish the theme-of the com- 
position and biographies of the author and composer. For 
instance, when Mendelssohn’s “Midsummer Night’s Dream” 
was the selection, we supplemented the lesson with “Lamb’s 
Tales,” from Shakespeare, and a brief life of the musician. 
Of course, the demand for this sort of supplementary work 
depends largely upon how fully the teacher wishes to cover the 
subject. 
Material for debate, covering the subjects at issue, are con- 
stantly called for, from “Should Santa Anna have been sen- 
tenced to death?” to the request by a 12-year-old boy for books 
on “Woman Suffrage.” Supplementing the art lesson with 
books, giving descriptions and pictures of artists and subject 
under study, furnishing graveyard ghosts to be used in com- 
position work in connection with the study of Gray’s Elegy in 
a country churchyard; supplying illustrations for suitable cos- 
tumes to be worn in a Latin play given by the high school 
pupils; these are only a few of the many supplementary aids 
that the library furnishes the school. 
Our chief difficulty with supplementary work is when a large 
number of pupils flock to the library at the same time, seek- 
ing information on any subject in the course of study; or an 
entire class wants material on one given subject—all to be 
provided at a moment’s notice. Recently a history class was
-P-A-G-E-665
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 663 
given the “Colonial period” as composition work and sent to 
the library for material; as the library’s books on the subject 
were limited, it was necessary to restrict the circulation and 
only allow them to be used in the library as reference books. 
It would always expedite matters and the children would re 
ceive better service if the teacher would send word a day or 
two in advance, when pupils are expected to consult library 
books. Only by organized codperation between the school and 
the library can this supplementary work be made most effec- 
tive, and the best use of the library made possible. 
Our purpose in serving the school is two-fold; first, to aid 
the teachers in their work and to create a desire in the student 
for further study of a subject; second, to develop and establish 
the reading and library habit. 
THE PLACE OF THE LIBRARY IN THE EDUCATIONAL 
SYSTEM OF TEXAS. 
ERNEST W. WINKLER, AUSTIN, TEXAS, 
There was a time when all instruction was oral. The 
teacher was obliged to rehearse with his pupils until they were 
in possession of the desired instruction. Such teaching re- 
quired much time; it placed the burden of the work on the 
teacher and made him indispensable to the pupil; it neces- 
sarily limited the number of pupils that could be taught and 
the number of subjects that could be presented. When writ- 
ing and writing materials came into use time was economized 
by having the pupil copy the subject-matter, thus enabling 
teacher and pupil to work independently of each other a part 
of the time; more pupils and greater variety of subjects of 
instruction were possible. The excellence and inexpensiveness 
of the printed book today have reduced the interdependence 
of teacher and pupil to its utmost minimum. Children pre- 
pare their lessons at home; the class period is used to test 
what has been learned and to give encouragement and direc- 
tion for future work. This gradual emancipation of the pupil 
has had great influence on his individuality. In many places, 
however, he is still kept rigidly within the narrow limits of 
the text-book. As many pupils formerly looked upon their 
teachers as the keepers of all learning, some pupils of today 
look upon the text-book as an epitomy of all knowledge on that  
-P-A-G-E-666
  664 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
subject. Such pupils need to be emancipated from the text- 
book. The school library accomplishes this result; it affords 
an opportunity for the pupil to read up, and in this manner 
acquire the habit of reading and book-using. 
“Before the close of the war between the States,* Texas 
had made no effort to provide more than free tuition for in- 
digent children; and notwithstanding large quantities of the 
public domain had long before been reserved for public schools, 
no steps had been taken to utilize them for that purpose. The 
whole educational question had been left to private enter- 
prise. When the war closed, and before the people had begun 
to recover from its dreadful ravages, a school system was 
launched upon them, which, to say the least, was better fitted 
for an older and richer State. Copied from older, richer and 
more thickly populated States, that system for a country pre- 
pared for its reception was comparatively without a fault. 
But the immense sums of money necessary to support it were 
extorted from a poor and unwilling people. The schools, 
though open to all, soon became exceedingly unpopular with 
a large majority of the people, both because of the unnecessary 
expenses incident to them and the manner in which they were 
conducted. It is not a matter of surprise that the system 
was overthrown, but it is to be regretted that its healthy 
features were not preserved and engrafted into the new one 
which took its place. But popular prejudice, repeating its 
history, drifted madly to the other extreme and inaugurated 
a system, weak in many respects, and illy fitted to the demands 
of the times and people. The bitter prejudices born of the 
old law created among the people a strong distaste to taxa- 
tion for educational purposes and indeed to free schools. 
Matters became brighter in 1876, and from that time 
the public schools have grown in favor.” 
The decentralization of the administrative forces of the free 
school system, the short terms for which these officers were 
chosen, and the limitations placed upon the taxing power for 
school purposes, resulting from the reactionary spirit engen- 
dered during reconstruction days, all these for many years 
made progress in educational matter in Texas very difficult. 
*Report of State Superintendent Benj. M. Baker for the two years 
ending August 31, 1886, pp. 5 and 6.
-P-A-G-E-667
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 665 
Thirty-five years have elapsed; a new generation has assumed 
control; the cumulation of beneficial results of such progres- 
sive legislation as was passed are making progress less difficult 
as time passes; yet much remains to be done. Only two years 
ago the State Superintendent had occasion to use the follow- 
ing language: 
“The State’s educational activities are the common schools, 
schools for the unfortunates, the normal schools, the Univer- 
sity with its branches, and a State library and museum. They 
are not an organic unity, as might be expected and desired, 
but each one is doing its own work without reference to the 
others. . . . From this cursory view, it is manifest that 
the State’s school ‘organization’ is loose, crude and wasteful, 
a patchwork rather than a system.”* 
It would profit little to attempt to discuss the work of the 
library in each of the component parts of the State’s educa- 
tional system. Attention will, therefore, be limited to the 
public free schools; they are oldest and stand in greatest need 
of help. Even here one finds much diversity as regards organi- 
zation ; however, there is a unity as regards their needs. 
The school library receives no mention in the laws of Texas. 
No funds are set apart for it, no mandate directs its estab- 
lishment and maintenance. The school library is on a plane 
with desks, blackboards and other school apparatus. It is one 
of those incidentals that receives attention or is neglected as 
those who have the welfare of the schools in charge may elect. 
The State Department of Education has been a_ potent 
factor in creating and directing the forces making for prog- 
ress in the public free school\ Up to the present time, how- 
ever, it has had its hands full dealing with matters of such 
fundamental importance as (1) the securing of funds with 
which to maintain the schools for at least six months each 
year. This length of school term was reached for the first 
time in 1909. The average salary of public school teachers in 
1909 was $61.75 per month for the six months that school was 
taught. (2) Securing trained teachers and superintendents. 
At present 114 counties have county superintendents of public 
instruction; 126 counties still have e# officio school superin-

ending August 31, 1908, pp. 7 and 8.

  666 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
tendents. (38) Securing suitable school houses with suitable 
desks, etc. During the school year 1909-1910, 770 school 
houses were built, an average of two school houses a day for 
the year, at a total cost of $2,578,680. Yet during the year 
ending 1910 schools were taught in 1,473 houses not public 
school property. 
Fortunately what is true of a large portion of the State 
is not true of every portion; there are school districts where 
the schools are well equipped in every respect, including school 
libraries. These are the forerunners of conditions which, it is 
hoped, will spread rapidly throughout the State; they speak 
with the persuasive eloquence of example in carrying forward 
the work. 
The establishment of a school library, when once determined 
on, involves a certain expense. State and county school funds 
cannot be used for the purchase of books. Only money raised 
by a local tax, or otherwise, can be used for this purpose. 
While this deprives the movement for school libraries of the 
encouragement and prestige that that State aid* might give, 
the obstacle is not an insuperable one, since the sum required 
annually for a school library need not be large, and can usually 
be raised without great difficulty where the proper energy 
and spirit are shown by the teacher in charge. 
The first mention of school libraries, found in the reports of 
the State Superintendent, is the number of libraries for the 
year ending August 31, 1889. These statistics are incomplete, 
and for certain years since they were entirely omitted from 
the reports. Beginning with the year 1901, they have been 
regularly published up to the present time. 
Broadly stated it is true that the increase in the number of 
school libraries is one of the results of the “general improve- 
ment of our rural schools in recent years, including teachers 
with better preparation for their work, better school buildings 
and equipment, and better educational sentiment of the peo- 
ple.” It will be noted that from 1889 to 1903, a period of 15 
years, the number of school libraries increased from 85 to 544, 
*State aid for school libraries was recommended in the State Super- 
intendent’s report for 1900-1902, p. 18a, as preferable to traveling 
libraries, which were favorably spoken of in the report for 1898-1900,

or 459 libraries, an increase at an average rate of 30 libraries 
a year; from 1903 to 1910, a period of 7 years, the number of 
libraries increased from 544 to 1434, an average increase of 
205 libraries a year. 
Time forbids an attempt to enumerate all the forces that 
are actively engaged in advocating school libraries. Hach is 
contributing a share and deserves credit. But the following 
may be named without discriminating against those passed 
over in silence; the State Superintendent, the county and city 
superintendents, and the teachers. The recommendations of 
the State Superintendent receive the attention of teachers 
everywhere. He has published lists of books recommended for 
school libraries in connection with the course of study.* The 
lists published heretofore leave much to be desired; the form 
in which they were printed detracted much from their useful- 
ness; yet whether the books recommended were purchased or 
not, the fact that such recommendation had been made was a 
useful argument for the advocate of school libraries. The 
county and city superintendents can arouse interest in school 
libraries during the teachers’ institute. The reports of the 
State Superintendent show that in several counties there have 
been remarkable increases in the number of libraries during 
the term of some such progressive superintendent. However, 
the actual raising of the money for the library falls on the 
teacher in charge. That they are equal to the task is shown 
by the fact that many libraries are being established; during 
the past year sums ranging from $15 to $25 were raised by 
rural schools where library day was observed. 
Nothing has been said about the quality of the books con- 
tained in school libraries. The data is not at hand for a dis- 
cussion of this point. The opinion, however, may be ventured 
that there is much room for improvement in many cases. This 
would only be a natural result of the conditions that exist 
today. 
Something should be done to insure the purchase of the 
right books for the different grades, and to aid teachers to use

chased. The first thing to be done is the preparation and 
publication, by the State Superintendent or by the Library

Commission, of a list or lists of books suitable for school 
libraries. These lists should be so arranged and annotated 
that they will be a real help to the teacher or superintendent 
who is to use them. Such lists are necessary because few 
teachers have at hand the data that would enable them to 
select the best in fiction, poetry, folklore, history, biography 
and nature study for each of the grades in his school. Better 
still would be traveling libraries, containing the books recom- 
mended in the lists. To place the books themselves before the 
teacher or superintendent would do more to secure the pur- 
chase of suitable books than anything else that could be done. 
Of course, if the traveling library could be inaugurated, there 
are many other uses which it would serve admirably. 
Secondly, some assistance should be given the teacher in the 
use of the books of the school library. “In high school, normal 
school and college she was not taught the supreme importance 
or reading skill and reading habit, she was not made to study 
literature for children or how to use it; she was not told 
about public libraries or how they could help her; and she 
was not given practice in the art of using books or in the 
methods of teaching that art. Coming into her work she finds 
a crowded curriculum with no mention in it of the promotion 
of home reading or the use of books by or through the resources 
of the public library; in fact, she finds no mention of the 
library at all; she finds no suggestions that she can, by using 
the library, either make her daily work easier or add to its 
efficiency; and she gets from those in authority no hint that 
she can, by codéperating heartily with the library, acquire such 
merit as may improve her rating and increase her salary.”*

school, a movement was begun about 1900 by the educators of 
the South to provide school libraries for all Southern rural 
schools. Work to this end has progressed steadily until there 
are at present over 25,000 school libraries in the Southern 
States, containing a total of approximately 3,000,000 volumes. 
Different plans have been followed in different States in 
securing these libraries, but in general a plan similar to that 
adopted by North Carolina had been followed. A graded list 
of from four to five hundred volumes has been prepared by 
the Superintendent of Public Instruction from which the 
libraries of the various schools could be selected. Upon a 
school’s raising $10, a like sum has been given both by the 
county board of education and the State, making what has 
been popularly called a “thirty-dollar library.” After the 
library has been established the school has had the privilege 
of adding to it annually or less frequently a “fifteen-dollar 
library” with funds raised in a similar way. After the libraries 
have been secured they have been placed in well-constructed 
bookcases in the school houses and have been administered by 
the school teachers or by pupil librarians. 
The contribution which these collections have made to the 
schools and communities has varied considerably. It has 
depended upon the teacher and librarian in charge and the 
county superintendent. Their interest in the library and their 
efficiency have determined the quality and quantity of the ser- 
vice. The fact that the collections have been composed of 
stimulating, vital books, however, has insured for them a gen- 
eral reading and a consequent usefulness of a very high 
average. 
The plan has been defective, however, in three particulars: 
First, no instruction has been given in normal schools and 
institutes in library administration and children’s reading. 
Consequently the teachers and librarians have not known how 
to adapt the books to the needs of the children and com- 
munities to the best advantage. Second, the lists from which 
the collections have been chosen have been too restricted in 
scope and suggestiveness. Third, proper provision has not 
been made by which the collections could be freshened up and 
their interest to the readers kept keen. 
Remedies for these defects, however, are easily found.
-P-A-G-E-673
JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGS. 671 
Proper instruction can be given in normal schools and insti- 
tutes and more adequate lists can easily be prepared. Main- 
taining keen interest may be more difficult. In the main it 
can best be done by bringing into the collection new, fresh 
material by means of traveling libraries operated either by the 
department of education, the State library or by the library 
commission. The Virginia State Library loans a traveling 
library of forty or fifty volumes to any school which has se- 
cured a small permanent library of its own. It sends the 
collection free of charge and allows it to remain until the 
end of the term. In this way new books are intermingled 
with old and the whole collection is kept fresh. The State 
Library in Tennessee sends six collections to any county super- 
intendent who, in turn, places them in six schools in the county 
and then shifts each of the six collections, permitting, in due 
course of time, each school to read the whole set of collections. 
When all the collections have been read by each of the schools 
they are sent back to the State Library and a new set is 
furnished. The original set is revised, mended and refreshed, 
and sent out again. These libraries are loaned only to schools 
which have permanent collections of their own, which, in the 
main, are composed of reference books. 
The original plan as thus modified is working well, and as a 
result the rural population is rapidly becoming a reading 
population. 
By way of further extension it is extremely desirable that 
the school library should also be made the nucleus of the com- 
munity free library. It should be opened to the public once 
or twice during the week as a reading room, and during the 
long vacation it should be opened regularly several afternoons 
or evenings weekly for the benefit of the entire community.

TRAINING FOR MOTHERHOOD. 
MRS. MAGGIB W. BARRY, SHERMAN, THXAS, 
When I read the name of the subject assigned to me for 
today I recalled how many times within the past year I had 
seen “Training for Motherhood” on the programs of women’s 
organizations and educational meetings generally. I found it 
usually associated with discussions on vocational, industrial 
and professional training for girls. The possible significance 
of this association came to me for the first time and some- 
what startled me. Has motherhood been relegated to the list 
of scientific domestic specialties for women? Is it no longer 
to be regarded as the function of an entire sex? Are we to 
have schools and courses of study where a limited number of 
girls, who may choose it as their vocation, may be trained for 
this specialty—just as we have law schools, medical schools 
and commercial courses? Does motherhood no longer exist 
in the mind of the educator as the great essential fact of 
womanhood—its highest and noblest expression, the object 
and end of all education of women? I cannot believe it. Cer- 
tainly, motherhood stands in the mind of the public at least 
as a synonym for womanhood, and we women should keep 
this identity undisturbed in the minds and hearts of our girls. 
Maternal potentiality is to women what the power of lan- 
guage-making is to the whole human race—that supreme en- 
dowment of word creation that places man somewhere between 
the beasts of the field and the angels of Heaven, as he chooses 
to use his gift. I would no more think of women specializing
-P-A-G-E-675
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 673 
for motherhood than I should think of human beings special- 
izing for talking; let them choose what vocation they will, 
rock breaking on a turnpike or oration making in the forum 
of the nation. 
For nearly six thousand years women were mothers and 
home makers and were happy and content to be so. I do not 
believe for one moment that they were coerced into it by the 
superior force of men, physical or intellectual, though con- 
sciousness of that force was a factor in determining her 
choice. I do not believe that there was a time in all those 
years that woman could not have unlocked other doors of op- 
portunity for the expression of her personality just as she has 
today. She stayed in that home because she chose to stay. 
The conditions and activities of the home life gave her com- 
plete self-expression. There was perfect adjustment between 
the education of the woman and the demands of the home. 
From earliest infancy she was shaped and formed to fill and 
adorn this particular niche in the temple of civilization. That 
adjustment no longer exists and we have the problem of this 
army of women outside the home in the field of productive 
labor. 
The determining forces of civilization and our system of 
education have evolved a more complex feminine personality 
and trained women to the ideals of men, while social and 
economic conditions have changed the ideals of home. No 
care has been taken to adjust these changes to each other, and 
the result is a misfit. Then there are other complications. 
Society, as a whole, refuses to recognize the new home and re- 
sents it that the new woman insists upon a right she has pos- 
sessed since the halcyon days of the Garden of Eden—the right 
to choose where and how shall express herself. 
We cannot stop the march of civilization, but we can change 
our educational methods, throw off the shackles of tradition 
and shape this new woman to fit this new home. With this 
- right teaching the woman of tomorrow may still be permitted 
to exercise her right of choice in her life work without danger 
of race suicide, for she will as surely give to society her will- 
ing service as mother and home maker as the bird will continue 
to build its nest in the spring time. That the young girls of 
today, who will be the women of tomorrow, have opportunity 
43

    674 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
for such training is the responsibility of the women of today. 
This obligation I fear we have failed to discern as clearly as 
we should. 
When social and economic problems arise, even though they 
may be most vital to women, we are too prone to step aside 
and let the men solve them from the man’s point of view; 
then we do the best we can, and because we are adaptable and 
resourceful, that best generally tides us over the emergencies 
as they arise. We do not think out these problems for our- 
selves as we should, but ask the men to take the initiative and 
then we codperate with them in trying to avoid the conse- 
quences of their very natural masculine blunders in handling 
things that only a woman knows. Men are becoming more and 
more absorbed in the exigencies of commercial life and in- 
clined to leave the responsibility of the family and social life 
to women. To meet the obligation this imposes, women must 
have the courage to stand the strain of decision and independ- 
ent action. Never was there a time in the history of the race 
when there was greater need for this self-assertion in women 
than there is at present in solving the problems growing out 
of the changing social order—an order that crystalizing around 
the strength of women. It seems to me we have pursued too 
long a policy of expediency, meeting emergencies as they arise 
instead of analyzing the formative forces of the age and out- 
lining a policy of adjustment between the new woman and the 
new home. 
Some years ago, when it became a recognized fact that women 
were really going out from the home, seeking service in the 
world of men, we were alarmed. We felt that there was some- 
thing abnormal and unfeminine in a growing ambition among 
so many women to engage in some form of productive labor 
outside of what we considered the limits of the home. We 
conservatives looked upon it as a pathological condition that 
called perhaps for heroic treatment. We failed to realize that 
woman was merely following her instinct made a habit by 
generations of productive labor in the household. Not woman, 
but the home, had changed. Science and machinery had trans- 
formed it from a busy industrial center, full of activity and 
interest, to either a place of idle, aimless leisure or ignorant, 
hopeless drudgery. With the advent of machinery and organ-
-P-A-G-E-677
JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGS. 675 
ized labor industrialism had passed from the home into the 
factory, and woman, robbed of her vocation in the home, fol- 
lowed it on the outside. Instead of spinning and weaving at 
home, she went to spin and weave in the factory. Education 
of women took no note of the fact that when the center of in- 
dustrialism shifted, the home changed from a producing center 
to a consuming center; that under these new industrial and 
social conditions a woman’s economic value in her household 
would grow out of her wisdom in administration, supervision 
and codperation rather than in her efficiency as a producer. 
In these new and broader fields of labor women soon found 
themselves in competition with men. To meet this they felt 
the need of better equipment. Higher education through the 
universities and a few women’s colleges modeled after them 
seemed to offer this opportunity, and women began to emulate 
men and accept masculine standards of culture. To them 
higher education meant a system of training and development 
based on the ideals of men. Economic considerations and the 
persistent demand of women for equal opportunities or rather 
the same opportunities as their brothers had soon opened the 
doors of a majority of the best institutions for men to both 
sexes. In thirty-six years schools for women decreased 38 per 
cent, while the number of women entering coeducational 
schools increased alarmingly. The warning came from the 
universities that coeducation would feminize our men. But 
the real danger, which we failed to take account of, was that 
it would masculinize our girls—not so much through the actual 
association of the sexes in school life, but that in spite of the 
number of women students the methods and ideals of these co- 
educational schools remained unchanged. The aim of the 
high schools was to prepare for the universities, or fit pupils 
to be economically independent as producers. There were 
from 24 to 24 per cent more girls than boys enrolled in the high 
schools yet they were boys’ schools to which girls were 
admitted. All the advisory officers and boards of control were 
men looking out upon the world and seeing it from the point 
of view of men, planning courses of study to develop the germ 
of manhood in the heart of the boy. 
Then a great light dawned upon us. The precious germ 
of womanhood, of motherhood, nurtured on this masculine 
 
-P-A-G-E-678
676 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION, 
pabulum developed too often into an amorphous thing. Girls 
trained in the country schools fiocked to the cities, joined the 
graduates from the grammar and high schools and filled the 
department stores, shops and offices offering clerical work— 
unskilled laborers on wages wholly inadequate to the bare 
needs of physical existence, the most serious menace to the 
moral soundness of the social life in our large cities. Trades 
schools and commercial courses however met this emergency to 
some extent, though such training did not remedy the most 
alarming and appalling evil of this army of women in the 
field of productive labor, celibacy and deserted homes. Then 
came the cry of race suicide from the men and we met it with 
the cry of back to the country, back to the home for the girls. 
In conference with the men, influenced largely by their 
prejudices and by tradition rather than an intelligent study 
of conditions we decided to patch the boys’ schools by equip- 
ping them with domestic science departments emphasizing the 
two specialties of cooking and sewing. This would place these 
two domestic activities in the ranks of skilled labor and make 
it possible for women to demand that the products of their 
work have a recognized money value in their household. This 
was good, for this new woman had eaten of the fruit of the 
tree of knowledge and knew she could attain economic in- 
dependence as well as her father, husband or brother and de- 
manded it. If domestic service did not give it to her she 
would find it elsewhere. Then, too, a scientific knowledge 
of cooking and skill in sewing will make woman more willing 
to undertake these duties in the home when cooking and sew- 
ing are a part of her domestic service. But there are limits 
to the influence of mere technical knowledge and skill in tak- 
ing women back to the home and the responsibilities of mother- 
hood, or in fitting her to meet them. Those two great modern 
forces, science and machinery, are making it as unnecessary 
for many mothers and home-makers to be scientific cooks and 
expert seamstresses as it is for them to be trained nurses, doc- 
tors and chemists. In this age of codperation these women 
would serve their families better by intelligently coéperating 
with scientific and domestic specialists. This, with a knowl- 
edge of values, of a proper apportionment of the family in- 
come and in general a judicious expenditure of money so as
-P-A-G-E-679
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 677 
to get the best returns in content and enjoyment, is often of 
more economic value to a household than specialized knowl- 
edge and productive efficiency in any one particular depart- 
ment. 
I would not have you think that I disparage the value of 
training in domestic specialties, but it seems to me that we 
are in great danger of going too far in specialized education 
for women even in this direction and have an unwarranted 
faith that this particular character of training added on to 
the high school curriculum, already overburdened, or an an 
appendage of the old A. B. ideals of universities, will solve 
the problem of the growing celibate classes and present domes- 
tic unrest. 
I cannot believe that skill in domestic arts and industries 
and scientific knowledge of the rearing of children will ever 
be a sufficient incentive to women to fix their choice on home- 
making and motherhood as their life work. And even if this 
should be true I do not believe that any amount of expert 
knowledge or deftness and skill in any one or more of the 
household arts can even take the place in the future mothers 
of our race of that broad and liberal culture of mind, body 
and soul and those established habits of virtue which are the 
basis of all right living. 
A knowledge of the science of right living is the essential 
factor in the training of mothers. God created and set apart 
woman for the great mission of teaching and conserving the 
human race. Fitness for this work, reverence for it, a sense 
of personal obligation to God and the human race to transmit 
life untainted with physical, mental or moral blemish should 
be the basis of her education and training. The science of 
right living and its expression through motherhood should be 
the fundamental part of the college course of not a specializ- 
ing few, but of all women. This can be accomplished not by 
the taking away from or adding to courses of study special 
subjects or text-books, though it does mean a gradual recon- 
struction of our entire system of education for girls. Cer- 
tainly it would call for a change in the purpose, ideals and 
methods of many existing schools where girls are trained. 
In making these adjustments we must not forget, too, the 
new social ideals that have enlarged the boundaries of the
-P-A-G-E-680
    678 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
home and projected it beyond the limits of fifty years ago. 
Women are no longer homemakers for the few gathered 
around their own firesides, but they must extend their ser- 
vices to the larger community group gathered in the free kin- 
dergarten, school rooms, detention home and social service 
centers in codperation, not competition, with men. To these 
the overwrought business man will give of his substance, but 
that tenderer, more subtle power that uplifts and upbuilds 
through personal relationship must come from the woman. 
Babies cannot live on modified milk alone any more than man 
can live by bread alone. Science may save the body, but only 
love can minister to the soul—love that is intelligent, kind 
and trained to service. Any education of women that fails 
to take into account this larger personal service has no claim 
to be characterized as either high or broad, I care not how 
much of scientific research or skilled craftsmanship it may 
represent. ‘ 
In conclusion, I would say that if the time seems out of 
joint we should not feel discouraged, but take it as a privilege 
that we were born perhaps to set it right. Every transition 
period brings its serious social problems, since it presents both 
the death agony of the old forces and the birth throes of the 
new. “The old order changeth, giving place to the new,” is 
the inexorable law of progress. Like faithful Sir Bedivere we 
may strain our eyes with aching hearts to catch the last 
glimpse of the passing order. But if we have the courage to 
climb to the heights and stand there long enough we may, 
as he did, see this, too, “vanish into light”—the light of the 
new sun that shall shed its warmth and radiance on the 
threshold of a new home and blend with the halo of mother- 
hood around the expansive brow of the new woman.

A SKETCH OF THE SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT MOVE- 
MENT: WHAT HAS BEEN DONE IN THE SOUTH. 
DR. W. B. EIZZELL, DENTON, TEXAS. 
School improvement in the South in recent times has re- 
sulted largely from the increased emphasis laid upon moral 
instruction, physical training and industrial education. Con- 
nected with one or more of these may be associated the largest 
and most influential movements that have characterized the 
progress of the South. The wider and more scientific pos- 
sibilities of bodily well-being and the economic and commer- 
cial prosperity of the present generation may be traced to the 
influence of one or more of these. The period immediately 
following the Civil War brought us face to face with the 
problem of illiteracy unknown before in any nation’s history. 
To reduce this condition was the first great problem entrusted 
to the schools of our democracy. It required a generation for 
us to get away from this restricted conception of the function 
of public schools. The larger view of more recent times has 
aimed not only to remove ignorance, but practically to give 
to each man a will subject to control, an efficient life made  
-P-A-G-E-682
  680 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
possible by a sound body and the wider dissemination of hap- 
piness by virtue of trained intelligence. 
Mr. E. G. Murphy, speaking before the N. E. A. in Boston 
in 1903, said: “Any description of the conditions of public 
education in the South must involve certain confessions of 
inadequacy and certain hearty celebrations of substantial 
progress.” Inadequacy resulted from several causes, among 
these being: (1) Poverty resulting from a devastating war; 
(2) methods of reconstruction; (3) class distinction that had 
grown. up in the past; (4) and the complex problem of creating 
a double system of public schools for the two races. Perhaps, 
however, our progress has been faster and surer by virtue of 
the complexity of this situation. Our needs were great enough 
to call for super-human effort; our poverty keen enough to 
renew our allegiance to manual labor and to direct our atten- 
tion to the importance of providing skilled producers. 
Moral Training.—With the large service that our schools 
were called upon to render there was the fundamental idea 
that the conservation of character must be a consideration of 
first importance. “The first moral law of the school,” says 
Chancellor, “is to prepare all, without exception, for the larg: 
est variety of activities, subject only to the limitations of each 
in ability, in character and in energy.” If this be true, the 
first and primary business of the State school is to give recog- 
nition to this moral law of the school. Two extreme condi- 
tions in the South have compelled recognition of this prin- 
ciple; viz., the demoralization resulting from war and in more 
recent time the pressure of temptation arising from a com- 
plex commercial environment. Ethical fortifications to meet 
the former need resulted in the building of many denomina- 
tional schools and colleges which have stood for the very best 
ethical and moral conceptions; the latter condition as met 
by an elaborate public school system where ideals of civic 
righteousness and high standards of moral training could be 
taught indirectly and incidentally with equal effectiveness. 
In the South, as elsewhere, educators have not agreed as to 
the best methods of ethical training. Three methods have been 
common: (1) By direct ethical teaching. A belief in the 
effectiveness of teaching morals by means of text-books. I 
read just a few days ago the book entitled, “Character: A
-P-A-G-E-683
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 681 
Moral Text-book,” by Henry Varnum, of Jacksonville, Florida. 
The author tells us that the book is planned for a year’s study. 
The preface closes with this remarkable sentence, “It will be 
impossible for any boy or girl who studies this book under- 
standingly to become a bad man or woman, although they may 
not become great.” (2) Another method, and one believed in 
by a great number of educators, is that moral instruction 
should be incidental and indirect. This has not only been an 
effective method, but it has been responsible for some of the 
most significant movements of recent times. The newer ideals 
of playgrounds, school athletics, etc., have been brought into 
prominence because of the belief in incidental moral instruc- 
tion. (3) A combination method has been adopted by some. 
Recognizing the distinction between morals and ethics, at- 
tempts have been made to combine text-book instruction with 
incidental and indirect methods, thereby reinforcing ethical 
principles with moral practice. 
Incidental moral instruction to be effective must grow out 
of conscious effort. The indirect method is not synonymous 
with indifferent methods. Our distinct advancement in the 
South has resulted in the conscious guidance of youth by 
means of incidental and indirect moral instruction. The 
school organization becomes an ethical instrument when we 
think of it as a coéperative group. We get our most vital dis- 
tinction between morals and ethics when we think of the rela- 
tion between the ethical content of subject-matter of instruc- 
tion as related to moral conduct expressed in the social group 
of school life. 
To supply the moral content we have sought histories that 
were not only true, but that gave proper emphasis to the qual- 
ities of man. We have sought in our school readers selections 
not only of literary merit, but those that reflected wholesome 
sentiment and correct ideals. 
The recognition that moral conduct must find expression in 
school activities has brought into existence some so-called mar- 
; ginal activities in the South that has wrought mightily in our 
school progress. Among these being public playgrounds, social 
center movements, parent teacher associations, libraries, school 
improvement societies, etc. :

tendent of Georgia states that over eighty counties have school 
improvement clubs composed of women. In North Carolina 
fifty counties have “Associations for the Betterment of Pub- 
lic Schools and School Libraries.” A similar organization 
exists in South Carolina with a membership of 2,000. In the 
other Southern States such organizations have been most help- 
ful. With the same idea of supplying material for ethical 
training school libraries have multiplied by the thousands. 
The Legislature of North Carolina has been appropriating 
money for rural libraries since 1901. In 1906 the Legislature 
of Virginia appropriated $7,500 for traveling libraries. Most 
of the other Southern States have made some provision for 
rural school libraries. Georgia reports 1,107 such libraries; 
Louisiana, 207; and Mississippi reports 500 created in one 
year. According to high authority it is estimated that there 
is now more than 5,000 rural libraries in the South and that 
they contain 500,000 volumes, valued at $250,000. 
Better books, more inviting playgrounds, better kept and 
more attractive school rooms have become the object of wide 
concern of our Southern people. Out of our achievements 
have come great moral force to thousands of our youths. 
“Play,” says Chancellor, “is the seed ground of intelligence; 
physical culture that of efficiency, and games that of morality.” 
“Education for Health.”’—At no previous time in our his. 
tory has there been a greater concern for the physical well- 
being of the people than now. Starting ten years ago with 
the material concern for the conservation of our natural re- 
sources we have come to understand that the conservation of 
life and character underlies the material problem. In the 
South we have been confronted with the problem of increasing 
our industrial capacity, and we have learned that this task 
is largely dependent upon the development of strength and 
the promotion of health. If the physical culture is the seed 
ground of efficiency, we need to cultivate it well. Dr. Elliott 
defines efficiency as the “effective power for work and service 
during a healthy and active.” The problem of health, there- 
fore, becomes a fundamental concern of the schools of the 
people. 
Bagley says in his Educative Process that, “The very virtues
-P-A-G-E-685
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 683 
of civilization impose upon everyone who lives the social life 
the paradoxical obligations to break nature’s laws. How to 
.get the most out of life with the least suffering; how to do 
the best work with the least drain; how to be human and 
civilized and still be a healthy animal, are problems that can 
only approximate solution through compromise.” This author 
illustrates the principles by saying that (1) the child’s nor- 
mal tendency is toward the active out-of-door life, while the 
school demands an in-door life. (2) The normal tendency is 
toward great freedom, while the school demands a marked 
inhibition of movement. To do as little violence as possible to 
the physical well-being of the child and at the same time con- 
serve and promote the needs of a well-ordered and progressive 
civilization has been and is a problem and the task of our 
people. 
We have set about the task in three ways: (1) By attempt- 
ing to protect the bodily senses—sight, hearing, smell, taste 
and touch—and the care of the body by means of sanitation, 
properly lighted and scientifically heated school buildings. 
And these building furnished with desks and other equipment 
to protect the body and to produce comfort. (2) By develop- 
ing physical endurance and muscular readjustment under the 
direction of skillful instructors of physical science. (3) By 
means of medical supervision and inspection of all school 
children. 
The first method named above has been responsible for the 
newer ideas in school architecture ; the second has been respon- 
sible for the larger emphasis given the importance of play 
and gymnastics in our public schools; while the last named 
has brought into existence and developed the great science of 
preventive medicine and the popularization of hygienic in- 
struction. 
We have in the South today over fourteen million dollars 
invested in school buildings. The average cost of construction 
has increased within the last five years from two hundred and 
thirty-five dollars each to over three hundred dollars each. 
The present tendency is to erect better buildings; to employ 
architects who have given special study to questions of light- 
ing, heating, sanitation and system of ventilation. The radical 
and wholesome changes now going on in the South are those

connected with hygienic improvement about the school. build- 
ings, both in cities and in rural communities. 
Medical inspection has not made the progress in the South 
that it should, but gradually our Southern cities are yielding 
to this sentiment and demand. George H. Martin asserts 
that “a community which has not provided through its proper 
authority for a thoroughgoing medical inspection of its schools 
is guilty of criminal negligence.” Garber, in his “Annals of 
Educational Progress,” says: “Seven out of every ten chil- 
dren need some form of medical treatment—three out of every 
ten for the eyes; two out of every ten for breathing troubles, 
and seven out of every ten for bad teeth.” Leonard P. Ayers 
estimates the annual waste through retardation, discourage- 
ment and dropping out of school because of remedial physical 
defects at twelve million dollars. 
A recent report of the Bureau of Municipal Research on, 
“What three hundred and sixty cities are doing for the physi- 
cal welfare of our school children,” gives the following facts: 
“Two hundred and eleven are furnishing medical inspection 
for infectious and contagious diseases; one hundred and 
seventy-one provide inspection and attention to defective 
vision, defective hearing, adenoids, hypertrophied tonsils and 
defective breathing; one hundred and nineteen give dental 
attention to children; and fifty-eight provide school nurses.” 
The larger attention that we are now giving to the physical 
condition of school children has given existence to another 
class of so-called marginal activities; namely, specially pre- 
pared children’s lunches, open air schools, and a_ special 
“health day” exercise. It is now being urged that a health 
day be observed in all the schools. January 12 has been sug- 
gested for this purpose and the movement has met with con- 
siderable favor already. 
In the South we are just beginning the great work of the 
conservation of health. Perhaps the greatest progress our 
schools will make within the next decade will be along the 
line of disease prevention and related activities. 
Industrial Education.—Matthew Arnold has pointed out 
that mankind is governed by two aspirations—one is the as- 
piration for pure knowledge, the other the aspiration for being 
of service or doing good. Emerson taught that acquisition
-P-A-G-E-687
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 685 
and skill in some manual art and the practice of this art was 
an esential element of culture. The progress of industrial 
education has been retarded by the idea that culture was in- 
consistent with manual skill. Not until we could appropriate 
the truth laid down by Arnold and Emerson could this type 
of education make much progress. 
At the present time the skilled man has become the ideal 
of the nation. To develop men to the highest point of efficiency 
has become an important object of our schools. To educate to 
the point of large industrial capacity and to endow through 
skill with the power of doing each task with ease and satisfac- 
tion has become the passion of the progressive schoolmaster. 
The high respect now enjoyed by the public school system 
is largely the result of this practical aim. 
Industrial education has two rather distinct aims—(1) the 
eultural; (2) vocational. Manual training began in this coun- 
try as a cultural subject and still and will ever conform to 
this purpose. However, it has stimulated a movement that 
has resulted in trade and apprentice schools of many types. 
The introduction of domestic science and domestic art is | 
largely conceived as cultural subjects, but these subjects have 
always been taught with a rather distinct realization that they 
were to prepare the girl for efficiency in the home. The in- 
fluence of this subject-matter, however, has lead to the estab- 
lishment of several trade schools for girls where the needle 
trades received large emphasis. : 
Manual Training—The Manual Training School of Wash- 
ington University, founded in 1880, marked the real beginning 
of the larger movement for a more practical curriculum for 
our high schools in this country. The last report of the United 
States Commissioner of Education states that in 1909 more 
than half of the cities, over 4,000 population, have provided 
for manual training. For the past ten years this kind of 
instruction has been gaining rapidly in the South. Few of our 
larger cities have failed to provide for it. In this section of 
the country, however, the aim of this instruction remains cul- 
tural, while in other sections it is leading to a vocation. 
Domestic Economy.—Instruction in domestic economy or 
household science followed closely in the path of manual 
training. The need of such instruction had long been felt. 
 
-P-A-G-E-688
  686 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Some experimental failures resulted at first, but the real merit 
of the movement finally lead to successful efforts, and the in- 
struction has constantly increased at a healthy rate. While 
this progress has been slower in the South than in other sec- 
tions, the work is now on a permanent basis and all progres- 
sive city systems have provided for it. 
Agriculture.—Agricultural instruction has gained headway 
in the South in recent years. This instruction is demanded by 
virtue of the general uplift of rural life and the necessity for 
more scientific methods of agriculture. Most of the Southern 
States require the subject taught in all common schools and 
require teachers to make some definite preparation to teach it. 
A number of our Southern States, to encourage the work have 
provided special appropriations for agricultural equipment 
and instruction. 
Briefly I have traced some of the progressive educational 
movements in our Southern Schools. Much remains to be 
done, but what has already been accomplished offers encour- 
agement to every thoughtful citizen. Hillis says, “If you 
would strengthen your optimism and your enthusiasm, get in 
touch with the schools of your country.” This statement was 
never quite so true as now. 
A great task rests upon us. We are living in a new age 
and confronted with new problems. The schools are called 
upon to meet greater and widening responsibilities. In the 
language of a foremost thinker I close this imperfect sketch: 
“I pray that within these varied orbits the people’s schools 
may do their schooling well, not as detached or isolated shops 
of truths and notions, but as deliberate and conscious factors 
of a sounder social equilibrium. I pray that they, North and 
South, East and West, may take their places as the organs of 
that force of social gravity, that moral dynamic which in the 
university of the world keeps the poise of factions and classes, 
upholds the authority of institutions, the majesty and the 
happiness of the government, the worth of laws, the high se- 
curities of freedom—that moral dynamic which wise men have 
called the fear of God, the force of affection and sobriety 
which holds life to reverence and reverence to reason—as, 
through their uncrossing pathways, the stars flash, star-lighted, 
round their suns.”

MODEL PLANS FOR RURAL SCHOOLS. 
L., L, PUGH, HOUSTON, TEXAS. 
This subject of “Model Plans for Rural Schools” did not 
receive much attention until the last two or three years, for 
the reason that there was no provision made for the financing 
of school buildings in Texas until the people added an amend- 
ment to the Constitution of Texas, by which means the shackles 
were taken off of the rural schools, thereby giving the people 
an opportunity to vote bonds for constructing and equipping 
of public free school buildings. 
Since that time Texas has made great progress along this 
line. The records of the Department of Education will show 
that there has been constructed upon an average of two houses 
per day in the State during the past year. 
After bonds are voted and funds are obtained from the sale 
of same, the first thing to be undertaken is the location of the 
schoolhouse. The schoolhouse ought to be located so as to 
make is accesible to the greatest number. Central location 
and cheapness of land are not the only considerations. It 
should be remembered that no lot is too good for school pur- 
poses, and that a wise selection from the standpoint of school 
interests is necessary. 
In the location of all structures for the habitation of man, 
the selection of the soil upon which the building is to stand 
is an important consideration. The greatest attention should 
be given to the character of the soil, the drainage, the size of 
the lot and the general surroundings. I believe that all au- 
thorities agree that such buildings should be located on soil 
as free from moisture as possible because the interstices of 
the soil are filled with air, and this air is in motion, just in 
the same way as the air above the ground, although, of course, 
to a much less degree. Cold air being heavier than warm air 
of course will displace the warm air, even if it is under the 
ground. Therefore, the air which is forced up from below the 
surface is impure. Its composition being changed because of 
its contact with the soil, the decomposition of organic matter 
contained in the soil, through the agency of bactera, “those 
most universal of all scavengers,” greatly decrease the amount 
of oxygen, while at the same time it generates a large amount
-P-A-G-E-690
  688 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
of carbon dioxide. Therefore, the air coming from the ground 
contains a much greater percentage of carbon dioxide and 
other noxious gases than the ordinary surface air. The soil 
beneath a building is usually dryer than it is around it. In 
rainy weather there is a tendency for the ground air to move 
from all sides towards the more porous soil, which is the point 
of the least resistance, and there to emerge, contaminating 
the air in the building above. There seems to be a greater up- 
ward movements of the air during the later part of the night 
and early in the morning than in the warmer part of the day 
because the air above the ground is cooled more quickly and 
warmer more quickly than that within the soil. At night 
when the air above the ground becomes cooler and therefore 
heavier than the ground air tends to sink into the ground, 
thereby driving out the warmer, lighter air with its acquired 
impurities. 
It would follow, then, from what has been said about the 
matter of ground air and its impurities that the drainage of 
school grounds deserves an important consideration. We have 
so found it to be a very vital point in locating school houses 
in this, the Gulf Coast country. It is unwise to select a school 
site which receives the surface drainage of any contagious 
ground, and especially if such ground is exposed or has been 
exposed to pollution of any source. It is always safer to 
select a site higher than any land in the community. This 
sometimes may be impossible and they will be compelled to be 
constructed on flat ground. In such cases it should be taken 
into consideration as to what place is most acceptable to 
underground drainage. The school site should contain from 
two to five acres, but if for any reason this is not possible, 
and the site is limited to one acre, I would recommend that 
it be 180 feet wide with a depth of 240 feet. It has been a 
very difficult matter to get parents to fully understand how 
important to the comfort, pleasure and welfare of the children 
is a large and well situated school grounds. They can readily 
see that cattle and horses will not thrive and remain healthy 
in small inclosures, but for some reason they do not extend 
the same consideration to their children. They cannot under- 
stand that it is a matter of small moment that a few of the 
children be compelled to walk a little farther than the others
-P-A-G-E-691
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 689 
if thereby a better and larger school ground can be secured. 
There is some reason in providing buildings near the homes 
for the children in the primary grades, but those in the inter- 
mediate and high school grades would be accommodated better 
and more rationally from every point of view, even at the ex- 
pense of a long walk, if, upon arrival at the school house, they 
could have before them a day’s work in a pure atmosphere, 
free from the interruptions of outside life. 
While the location’ of the school house is necessarily the 
duty of the board, it is nevertheless true that teachers, if pre- 
pared to advise in such matters, can often be of the greatest 
assistance by bringing before the minds of the people the im- 
portant questions of hygiene. 
After the location has been fully determined, the next duty 
of the board is to select the architect. It has been the custom 
in many places in our county to build schoolhouses according 
to ready-made plans furnished by so-called builders. These 
plans are not sufficient as to give any accurate result of the 
finished product. The specifications are indefinite and a num- 
ber of times extra expense is incurred in attempting to follow 
them. The best thing to be done, even in erecting a one-room 
building, is to secure the services of an honest and competent 
architect. It is often the case that school boards rarely have 
any intimate acquaintance with the demands and necessities 
of modern school buildings, and have not the time to avail 
themselves of this privilege. I have noted instances where 
boards of educations have come together for the purpose of 
selecting plans for the erection of school buildings through 
competition. One by one the architects have been called before 
them to extol their products and point out the superiority of 
their respective plans over all other possible plans. And I 
have noticed that the most plausible talker with the best eleva- 
tion and the greatest number of carriages and school children 
approaching the building generally receives the vote of the 
board. In large cities school boards employ a competent 
architect, who gives his whole time to this specialty, and I 
believe better results are being obtained along this line. I 
know of no class of public buildings deserving of more sincere 
thoughtfulness and artistic treatment than school buildings, 
as they are used to house and accommodate our children who 
44

spend here the greater part of their waking hours during their 
early years. 5 
Country people are sometimes careless about the appearance 
of their schoolhouse and grounds. It then becomes a double 
duty for those who are able to build new buildings to place 
before the others better models. Real beauty is not expensive, 
and the best things are in reach of us all. The school building 
is the citadel of democracy, and there is developed about it a 
sentiment of dignity and decorum, influential in all its move- 
ments. In the old days school buildings were locked up as 
an ornament so far as the public was concerned; but we are 
glad to know that at the present time these buildings are used 
for worthy social work of all kinds, and it brings the school 
work into more vital touch with the real life of the world. 
It is a great aid in bringing the American community into a 
more vital relation with the teachers, and those who are re- 
sponsible for the schools and the school organization. Includ- 
ing this portion of the subject, I desire to express the wish 
that some day in the near future more pains will be taken to 
make schoolhouses beautiful in external appearance as well 
as commodious and healthful within. 
I would suggest that each large building be constructed 
with a basement in places where the drainage can be provided. 
It serves as a suitable location for the engine rooms and heat- 
ing plants, doing away with the noise of building fires in the 
various rooms and removing ashes from the stoves. It is also 
a great economy, as you can provide more room in the base- 
ment than any other part of the building. It also, if provided 
with good drainage and ventilation, prevents the rise of 
moisture in the walls and ground air into the class rooms 
and halls. It provides places for play rooms in bad weather; 
a place for hot lunches to be served when provided for by the 
various mothers’ clubs. Rooms for manual training can be 
located in the basement, if you are not financially able to con- 
struct other buildings for this purpose. I would suggest that 
the floor of the basement be made of a good quality of cement. 
The basement walls should be glazed with glazed light-colored 
brick to increase the light and make the walls more sanitary. 
I will not attempt to discuss the strength of foundation, 
but to say that nothing but the best materials should be used.
-P-A-G-E-693
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 691 
I wish to call your attention to one thing that is often over- 
looked, and that is: How can the foundations of our brick 
and wooden school buildings be so constructed that the walls 
above the ground will not, through capillary attraction, con- 
vey moisture from the earth and in this way introduce un- 
hygienic conditions into the school rooms, which are evidenced 
by sweating blackboards, discolored walls, rotting floors, and 
causing that cold atmosphere most in the morning when the 
schoolhouse is first opened? The amount of moisture in the 
walls will depend upon the construction of the foundation 
and the amount of water contained in the ground that comes 
in contact with the foundation. Concrete foundations with 
good wide footings are doubtless the best when made with 
scientific care, as it is much less porous than brick. Each 
building should be provided with strong durable eve gutters, 
and a sufficient number of down pipes to carry off the water 
from the hardest rains. The down pipes should empty into 
some earthen pipes so as to carry the water a safe distance 
from the wall. 
We are now ready to take up the flooring of the buildings, 
being that part of the school room which receives the roughest 
usage, and when laid of poor material and improperly, is un- 
sanitary and difficult to keep in order. There, perhaps, is no 
part of the building that has so much to do with general sani- 
tation and neatness of the class rooms as the floor. It is a 
great mistake to spare expense and put in cheap floors just 
because they are less expensive. The first floor should be du- 
rable to prevent the inflow of ground air and bad odors from 
the basement. A good quality of asbestos paper will serve 
the purpose of decreasing and at the same time presents a 
fairly good barrier to the entrance of ground air. The double 
floor will save cost in fuel in the colder climate. As we have 
emphasized that the first floor should be double on account 
of cold floors, bad odors and bad ground air, we find that the 
other floors give us trouble on account of the noise. 
The problem of deadening the stairways, the floors of the 
halls and rooms of the upper story is, therefore, a more in- 
sistent one than it is for the lower rooms. There are on the 
market a great many patent deadening felts or quilts designed 
‘for this purpose. After floors are laid and well prepared, they 
 
-P-A-G-E-694
692 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
should be treated with wax, dustless oil dressing, or some other 
durable protecting material. The so-called dustless oil dress- 
ing has, when used with skill and judgment, proved of great 
service in protecting floors and preventing the dust and dirt 
from rising into the air. It is best to put in on sparingly, 
however, to prevent any possible odors and more especially 
to prevent it from soiling the skirts of the larger girls and the 
women teachers. Janitors have found that is saves much time 
in dusting. 
In the planning of school buildings it is important to pro- 
vide sufficient blackboards and to place them in the proper 
place with reference to light. A large area of wall space set 
apart in class rooms for blackboards assumes that pupils will 
individually present to their fellow classmates and to the 
teacher the results of their study, so that the free give and 
take of criticism will result in an independent, self-helpful 
assurance, necessary to all good citizenship in our form of 
government. Blackboards are pedagogical conveniences and 
civic agencies worthy of consideration. There are many kinds 
of blackboards which will not be discussed on account of time 
in this paper. 
The question of doors and how they should be opened and 
be constructed to swing is getting to be of much importance of 
late years. Some State laws are already enacted compelling 
doors of school buildings to swing out. And it is useless to 
say, but we all agree that all outside doors should be made 
to swing outward. The auditorium or asembly room is an im- 
portant thing in a school building; it is the center of school 
life. In most of the large buildings constructed in this county 
during the past year we have added an auditorium. The first 
question to consider is its location in the building. The prac- 
tice, I believe, has been to put the auditorium on the second 
floor, but I have studied the conditions very closely and believe 
that they should be on the first floor, as by this means large 
audiences are enabled to gather without climbing stairs. . It 
gives opportunity for announcements by principals, or for 
short readings and addreses. Such a room should be provided 
with a stage of ample size, upon which the young people will 
gather on graduation days to receive their diplomas. There 
should be dressing or retiring rooms at each end. All assembly
-P-A-G-E-695
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 698 
rooms should be well lighted, and the stage should have win- 
dows, as the lighting of an assembly hall is an important 
feature in its usefulness and should be given careful considera- 
tion. In our villages and in our country high schools there 
is more need for them than in larger cities with more preten- 
tious buildings. Provision can be made so that the auditorium 
may be divided into study rooms by arranging folding doors, 
as has been done in many instances in this county. 
All ordinary class rooms should be of the standard size, 
same being well lighted; the light always coming from the 
left and rear. Plenty of room should be provided for passage- 
ways and a capacity for seating forty or forty-five children, 
as that is as much as any one teacher should attempt to in- 
struct, even if they were all in one grade. 
The heating of the school room is a very important factor 
as regards the success of the school. There are various and 
sundry methods of heating buildings, some of which are a 
great improvement over others. Our old time schoolhouses 
were heated by fireplaces. They proved very unsatisfactory 
in so far that if the pupils came too near the fire they would 
get too hot, and those a short distance from the fire would 
suffer with cold. After giving the fireplace a test, the box 
stove came next with greater efficiency and economy. It 
heated the room, but afforded no means of equalizing the tem- 
perature in the various parts of the room. When situated in 
the center of the room it is in the way, and if located near 
the end or side of the room it is ineffective for the room as 2 
whole. A great majority of our country schools are yet in 
the box stove era, but the buildings of today are being more 
carefully constructed, and thereby the children are being pro- 
tected somewhat better from the cold. 
The jacket stove affords a very good means of heating the 
room, and is being used a great deal in the rural schools of 
Texas. In this case the stove is placed in the corner of the 
room, and always has a jacket put around it, as an unjacketed 
stove scorches the faces of the children near it, while those 
further away are too cold. In large buildings central heat- 
ing systems are less troublesome and less expensive, and far 
more satisfactory than stoves, when properly planned and in- 
stalled. Scientific investigations have demonstrated that
-P-A-G-E-696
  694 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
warm air should enter the room from the inner walls about 
six feet from the floor and the foul air should be taken out 
from the bottom of the room on the same side. The hot air 
furnace is now taking the place of the box heater in the rural 
schools of the county, as this system of heating has been in- 
stalled in a number of the new buildings of this county the 
past year. Being installed by parties who understood their 
work, this system has given eminent satisfaction, making a 
great improvement over the old method of heating. In con- 
clusion, I wish to say a few words upon the subject of ven- 
tilation. It would require a volume to discuss the problems 
connected with ventilation, therefore, 1 will only call attention 
to the importance of it, leaving methods to the listeners of 
this paper. I can see no reason why the health of the child 
should not be protected. There is no doubt, even at this day, 
that this question seems strange to some people. It should 
not be, though, for the people love their children, and they 
certainly want their children to grow up strong and healthy, 
physically, morally and mentally. I have found it the case 
among parents today that if you mention something about 
the natural laws of the child, they hesitate. They say that 
taxes are already too high. I assure you that if their child 
was drowning in a stream they would not hesitate a moment 
on account of the expense. This is not because they do not 
want to give their children every advantage, but because the 
facts of the second case is before them and they understand 
it. Air starvation is the primary cause of the most terrible 
diseases that afflict humanity today. Diseases of the lungs, 
coughs, pneumonia, all find the most favorable conditions for 
development in the foul air and sudden changes of temperature 
in the school room. 
Rural communities with pure air in abundance and health- 
ful habits of living should avoid most of this sickness and 
suffering. The fact that they do not is largely due to the un- 
sanitary conditions of their school rooms. Even though you 
ignore the child’s health entirely, when you find that 25 per 
cent of the money you spend for maintaining your school is 
wasted because of the lack of ventilation, you then realize its 
necessity. The farmers of today even ventilate their barns, 
pigpens, etc., then why not ventilate our school buildings?

MODEL PLANS FOR A RURAL SCHOOL. 
W. T. POLLARD, MANOR, TEXAS, 
The spiritual man is to be reached only through the agency 
of physical media. The spiritual highway lies along a material 
roadway. The Divine Master, when he planned the redemp- 
tion of man, could devise no scheme of reaching humanity 
more compatible with the nature of the human soul than that 
of the “Incarnation.” Jesus Christ, the Immortal Teacher and 
Savior of mankind, came to earth in the physical habiliments 
of flesh and blood. The only means of approach to the dwell- 
ing place of the human spirit is the physical roadway along 
which thought and emotion and volition have traveled since 
the time of man’s creation. 
The school is a spiritual organization. Its most important 
function is to reach the minds of its pupils with proper 
stimuli for the necessary exercise and development of their 
several abilities. Free and easy access to the mind of the 
child involves serious thought as well as energy and expense 
in the plan of the school in which the child is to be trained. 
The physical equipment of the school is second in importance 
only to the mental and moral training of the teacher. 
In the construction of a model plan every detail of the 
external equipment must be wrought out with extreme care. 
In its broadest sense, such plan should include the considera- 
tion of several essential provisions: (1) The extent of the 
district—its mileage of good roads, its facilities for transpor- 
tation, and its general accessibility to the schoolhouse from 
all parts of the district; (2) the school grounds—their loca- 
tion and nature as to drainage and character of soil, their 
equipment with apparatus for physical exercises and games, 
their outbuildings, etc.; (3) the plans of the building itself— 
its appointments, its furniture and its supplies. The greater 
portion of this brief discussion will be devoted to the last 
two of these topics. 
As to the size of an ideal district, opinion varies, the extent 
of area being considered as contingent upon the topography of 
the country and the uniform density of its population. We 
will assume that the nature of the surface, the character of 
the soil, the location of streams, and the even distribution of 
the people throughout the community are such as to justify
-P-A-G-E-698
  696 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
the location of the schoolhouse in the geographical center of 
the district. This being the case, the plot will best conserve 
the interests and convenience of the pupils if laid off in the 
form of a square about four miles of each side. With four 
graded roads crossing the district, two as diagonals and two 
passing through the center parallel to the sides of the square, 
the school would be easily accessible from all parts of the dis- 
trict either with or without free transportation. Such a dis- 
trict would contain an area of sixteen sections, the most re- 
mote point of which would be less than three miles from the 
school and no place within the limits of its boundaries would 
be more than one-half mile from a graded road. Counting 
one family for each 80 acres of land and an average of two 
scholastic children from each family, the school would consist 
of two hundred and fifty-six pupils—about as many children 
as it is possible to bring together under favorable moral con- 
ditions. A few figures will readily reveal the fact that a sub- 
stantial local fund may be derived, as a supplement to the 
State appointment, from a fifty-cent tax on a $50 or $60 per 
acre valuation of the property of this community. Such a dis- 
trict, therefore, appeals to me as ideal in point of size, in con- 
venience, in number of pupils and in available resources. 
As has been ably shown in the preceding paper, the selec- 
tion of a school site of suitable size, properly drained and 
favorably situated with regard to sanitary considerations, is 
a matter of no small importance. If possible, the school site 
and adjacent playgrounds should occupy an elevation gently 
sloping in all directions from the schoolhouse and lying far 
away from any sources of impurities that would vitiate the 
air, either above or below the surface. The school building, 
when properly located, will be situated on the highest point 
near the center of a campus of about twelve acres in the form 
of a rectangle, say 400 feet wide and 580 feet in length. The 
rear half of the plot should contain the stables, outhouses and 
playgrounds for the smaller children. The portion of the 
grounds allotted to the small children should be fully equipped 
with see-saws, giant-strides, ladders, merry-go-rounds, swings 
and such other apparatus as is best adapted to the entertain- 
ment of children who have not yet reached the “team” stage 
of development. The front half of the campus should be di-
-P-A-G-E-699
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 697 
vided into three portions: (1) a division for boys’ organized 
games—such as baseball, football, and the like; (2) a division 
for girls’ organized games—such as tennis, basket ball, and 
volley ball; (3) a section equipped with horizontal bars, jump- 
ing boards, giant strides, and other apparatus for boys who do 
not play ball. 
Along the sides of the campus and on the lines of division 
there should be rows of shade trees and such flowers as would 
grow without special attention during vacation. 
On one side of the campus and contiguous to it, there should 
be a field of several acres belonging to the school, to be used 
in teaching gardening and agriculture. 
After the excellent discussion of the leading paper on this 
topic, anything that might be said relative to the structure of 
the Model house and as to the material used, would not only 
be superfiuous, but would amount to a mere repetition of what 
has already been said. The remarks in this paper relative to 
the building itself will accordingly be confined to the different 
appointments of the building—the comfort and arrangement 
of its class rooms, its cloakrooms, its halls, its entrances, its 
furniture, and its supplies. To accommodate the number of 
children mentioned above, a building of about seven rooms 
would be necessary, forty pupils being the average number to 
the room. The most economical and the most convenient house 
of this size would probably be a two-story building, 69 feet by 
72 feet, with four rooms and a large central hall below, and 
with three rooms and an assembly hall above. In addition to 
these two floors there should be a basement of three large 
rooms—one for fuel and furnace, one for a general workshop, 
and one for a playroom and dining department for rainy days. 
The class rooms above the basement should be of uniform 
size, 24 feet by 36 feet, and 14 feet in height, with a cloakroom 
four feet wide for each recitation room extending two-thirds 
the length of the room itself, and so situated that pupils may 
pass through these cloakrooms in entering and leaving the 
class rooms. 
The windows of the recitation rooms should be high enough 
to permit draughts to pass over the heads of pupils seated at 
their desks. Above each window there should be a transom 
reaching entirely to the ceiling in order that the foul air at 
 
-P-A-G-E-700
  698 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
the top of the room might be allowed to escape when necessary. 
In addition to these ventilations, there should also be ventilat- 
ing flues with openings near the floor, which openings will af- 
ford the ordinary means of escape for the impoverished air. 
Hot-air heating apparatus, properly regulated, with furnaces 
in the basement, is perhaps the best system to be used, though 
the ventilating stove is an excellent substitute where the in- 
stallment of a furnace system is not practical or where a re- 
liable janitor is not available. 
All seats and desks should be adjustable, since few grades 
of children are so uniform in size as to require seats of the 
same height. Neither is there any assortment of seats to be 
made such that there will be no readjustment necessary to 
meet the requirements of different sets of pupils promoted from 
year to year. 
Each room should be bountifully supplied with maps, charts, 
globes, blackboards, blocks, measures, and other appliances for 
objective instruction—each one according to the peculiar needs 
of the grade of pupils accommodated. 
In the foregoing pages, we have undertaken to present an 
ideal school, an ideal district with ideal roads, an ideal play- 
ground with ideal equipment, an ideal building complete in all 
its appointments. We must remember, however, that while 
such conditions and provisions are necessary, they do not con- 
stitute the end sought; they only serve as a means of contribut- 
ing more fully to the highest welfare of the individual child. 
The conditions which these provisions supply are just as neces- 
sary for the small one-teacher school as for the model seven- 
teacher school herein presented. It is equally important for 
the small school as for the larger one that the building be lo- 
cated upon well-drained soil; that it be properly heated and 
ventilated; that it receive its light from one side and from 
above; that it be provided with sanitary drinking apparatus; 
and that it be surrounded by a large, well-equipped playground 
free from the evil effects of unsanitary closets and from other 
sources of contagion or infection. By observing such details, 
each rural school may become a model school of its own class 
in all the essentials, and every one will approach the ideal 
school as time goes on. 
If such a school as the one presented for your consideration,
-P-A-G-E-701
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 699 
such a district with its good roads, such a playground with its 
apparatus, such a house with its various appointments, is ob- 
jected to as a mere ideal beyond the possibilities of realization 
by the ordinary rural school, it may be replied that there is in 
Travis County, Texas, a village school which is almost a dupli- 
cate in physical equipment of the ideal here presented. A 
school of such a character is not an invention, not the result 
of abstract thought; it is a growth—the result of experience 
and of grim determination on the part of its builders to have 
nothing short of the best. In realization of an ideal, difficul- 
ties must be expected, for between the ideal and the real lie 
many serious obstructions. These obstructions can be and 
must be overcome. If a district lacks sufficient territory and 
population, let the remedy be consolidation; if it lacks good 
roads, let it build them; if it lacks funds, let it levy a sufficient 
tax; if it is wanting in sentiment, that panacea for all defi- 
ciencies, let the teacher and the school officers arouse the peo- 
ple to a sense of their duty in behalf of a rising young citizen- 
ship, and there will be forthcoming all things necessary for a 
Model School.

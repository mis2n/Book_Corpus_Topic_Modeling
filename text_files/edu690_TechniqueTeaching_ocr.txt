      FOREWORD 
Tue Technique of Teaching is primarily devoted to actual 
teaching situations. Its professional purpose is to analyze 
classroom activities which the instructor may have performed 
mechanically without being conscious of principles involved, to 
afford opportunity for intelligent evaluation of procedures in 
common use, and to suggest as diversified methods of presen- 
tation as the limits of one small volume render possible. 
In addition to a concise treatment of accepted teaching activi- 
ties and a brief study of current innovations, method in six 
fundamental subjects is discussed in concrete terms. Psycho- 
logical principles of which method studies should be the 
application lose none of their truth or scientific value by being 
presented in their schoolroom contacts as found in the everyday 
experience of teachers. The work of every skillful classroom 
artist abounds in a wealth of minor expedients and devices; 
the genuine expert perceives clearly that devices are never an 
end. In the specific illustrations and cases at the close of each 
chapter may be found abundant opportunity for testing such 
devices by principles outlined or developed in the chapter 
which precedes. . 
With most teachers, principles emerge from processes. After 
utilizing a bit of technique, many times perhaps, its underlying 
meaning and purpose may stand revealed. Specific and con- 
crete teaching suggestions are worth while when they lead to 
intelligent use of new methods, even though an imitative stage 
come before the new plane of intelligence. Imitation of class- 
room devices is bad only when it never achieves more than the 
mechanical and rule of thumb. It is not too much to hope that 
those who read this book will find plans described which they 
may imitate. Along with this material which “teachers can 
oT71

actually use,” they will miss the finest educational growth if 
new technique does not also bring added meaning and under- 
standing to daily schoolroom tasks. . 
Aside from hundreds of his colleagues whose classrooms he 
has visited as inspector or supervisor, and the faculty of 
Montana State Normal College, to whom he is under obliga- 
tion for helpful suggestions, the writer is indebted to his sister,

uscript critically and constructively. Finally, acknowledgment

THE 
TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 
CHAPTER ONE 
THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 
Clear professional thinking. Teachers must be clear in pro- 
fessional thinking if they would be correct in practice. Lack 
of clearness is woefully apparent in discussions of educational 
aims, curriculum values, and methods. Inflated rhetoric is 
too seriously taken by those who lack perspective. Not all 
who lecture to teachers are sane; some are victims of an 
unusually barren public school experience which they very 
naturally attack as typical, when, even though it may have 
been notoriously bad a generation ago, it is found to-day only 
where ignorant teachers hold sway. Even granting balance 
and honesty of treatment, the little expedients which many 
reformers advocate are but half comprehended by the imma- 
ture and untrained, and would be useless because obvious 
if we but had an adequately trained teaching corps. The 
clear-thinking teacher is not alarmed by reforms nor distressed 
by fads. He analyses each successive educational catchword 
and turns it to account in improved teaching technique. 
Lack of perspective perverts judgment. With a little and 
therefore a dangerous learning, the unprepared of the pro- 
fession find their world crumbling when an improved bit of 
technique is proposed: “Methods are suffering great improve- 
ment recently” is the self-expressed conviction of one of these 
apprentices. A useful device is hailed as a revolutionary 
I 
 
-P-A-G-E-10
  2 The Technique of Teaching 
principle. Appropriate generalizations are utilized inappro- 
priately. “Make the school homelike” sounds well and is 
seized for general application without settling the important 
matter of whose home the school is to resemble or disposing 
of what seems a valid claim that schools have a right to be 
school-like, entitled to their own modes of work. “Learn to 
do by doing,” a useful maxim in certain stages of learning, 
is quoted to justify irrational activities of doubtful educational 
value because some have never discovered that the distin- 
guishing mark of higher grades of intelligence is ability to 
learn without doing, and that after doing has reached the 
plane of routine it is no longer accompanied by learning at 
all. “Making learning concrete” is held too long as a goal by 
those who have not thought far enough through their problem 
to realize that, despite the value of concrete beginnings, real 
thinking is hardly possible until the concrete can be largely 
discarded. The foregoing illustrate the tendency of unanalyzed 
precepts to obstruct rather than to guide. When rules for 
devices supplant principles the case is even worse. 
Educational principles acquired through practice. Principles 
are recognized by those at home in the educational world; 
rules are for the apprentices who form so large a proportion 
of America’s teachers. “In doing his work, in so far as he acts 
from rule or precept, an individual’s full, personal preference 
is not accorded. The rule may help him once, and, indeed 
many times, but he is not perfectly free. The rule is in a sense 
a prescription for his activity; it is commanding, fixed, im- 
perative. A principle, on the other hand, is experimental 
rather than something fixed; it is a method for or of action 
rather thana prescription for it.”! Great principles should free 
rather than mold the worker in education, thus keeping him 
alive and growing. 
But teaching principles are not acquired at once or by de-

-P-A-G-E-11

ductive treatment. They are usually but faintly compre- 
hended until actual teaching experience clothes with human 
meanings what seem at first empty or obvious generaliza- 
tions. In the technique of instruction, method principles may 
be the general guide, but actual teaching is done with school- 
room devices. If properly method conscious, teachers evaluate 
every classroom expedient. By this process of critical analysis 
of actual teaching or judging the device suggestions of method 
literature, principles emerge as guides; meanwhile classroom 
technique is sharpened by each successfully applied new pro- 
cedure. Many teachers seem afraid of devices—a warranted 
fear only when these become irrationally imitated rule of 
thumb. Enlightened classroom artists—for that is what 
thousands of our finest teachers are—welcome every hitherto 
unused technique but are never slavish in application. It 
is the purpose of this and succeeding chapters to present 
classroom method as practiced in modern elementary schools 
and to furnish practical devices for discussion, evaluation, 
and use. The growing teacher capitalizes experience by con- 
structive study of his own work. The one who develops 
fastest also utilizes the experience of others. 
Principles and attitudes universally valid in teaching. Be- 
fore considering teaching activities in detail, a summary of 
important attitudes characteristic of real teachers of all 
times will be given. Such attitudes do not consist of measurable 
procedures; a technically faultless instructor noticeably 
lacking in one of these essentials might be a total failure. 
With little conventional skill one liberally endowed with such 
attitudes might be indifferently successful, but the only person 
a would-be teacher can afford to emulate is strong in these 
and technically expert as well. 
1. We are teaching pupils, not subjects. It is not primarily 
subject matter we are dispensing; we are developing boys 
_and girls through their school experiences, If it were necessary
-P-A-G-E-12
4 The Technique of Teaching 
to ruin his ideals or attitude toward life in order to make sure 
of his geography and arithmetic, a pupil would better pass 
through life without these, but such is never the alternative. 
Though there is the constant tendency to stress school “sub- 
jects” in isolation from each other and from life, it is only the 
poorest teacher who does not know at a given moment what 
subject is being taught and mystically say, “I am not teaching 
anything in particular; I am teaching these children.” 
2. Emotional response important. Teaching is concerned 
with emotional response not less than with subject matter 
reaction. If one danger more than all others threatens popular 
education, it is that of being fed-up with what we call culture— 
of not being hungry for more of what the school introduces. 
The result of effective teaching is to stimulate and keep alive 
intellectual appetites which multitudes of pupils seem never 
to feel, or feel only to lose even before their school days are 
over. Right teaching builds life interests; it makes books, 
museums, music, art, a wide knowledge of current events, 
the objects of impelling interest. 
3. Education develops ability to work. Teaching means 
developing capacity for work,—sustained, independent, in- 
tellectual effort. In this it is the teacher’s business to make 
himself unnecessary. If an educated person is worth more 
to society than one who is ignorant, the difference is as much 
in his working ideal as in his immediate mental content. If 
school life has been worth anything, he has learned and re- 
members much but in addition is constantly widening his 
own cultural frontier. No teacher assigns him reading lessons, 
but he reads; no one corrects his compositions, but he is 
critical of his own writings; from school projects he has learned 
to find and work out his own. 
4. Large ideals of teaching procedure insure impress. Best 
teaching is positive, treating even little matters in large ways. 
Much attention is placed upon what is purposely being
-P-A-G-E-13
  The Technique of Teaching 5 
done and less upon the unrelated and inconsequential. Lower- 
ing a pupil’s class standing because he is late and counting 
off a minute percentage from a history paper because of each 
misspelled word are examples of little ways of doing things. 
Better far not to have the tardiness; strong teachers find more 
direct and fair means of its prevention than the doubtful 
expedient of lowered marks. If the spelling is below par, 
why accept the history paper at all? Teachers who make 
real impress are usually those with whom work is positively 
accepted or rejected rather than those who qualify acceptance 
with the discount of some small, and to most pupils irrelevant, 
mark of school management. 
5. Learning is attention. Holding the attention of each 
pupil every minute is the ideal. The inattentive child is 
absent. If class work begins with promptness and force and 
the teacher sees all, order is preserved by vigorous, spontaneous 
interest. Calling for order is confession of failure to secure 
it in the manner of all great teachers. “I teach so well that all 
are keenly participating” is the ideal rather than “Sit still 
so that I can teach you.” A teacher has the right to demand 
attention, but one who must call too often loses teaching edge. 
Suppression is characteristic of the schoolroom autocrat of 
an earlier generation. 
Belief in pupils essential. A permanent endowment of all 
inspiring teachers is the optimism of belief in their work, and in 
their pupils. Cynical, apathetic, or colorless persons cannot 
teach; the warmth, cheer, and enthusiasm of vital personality 
inspire performance. Though actual attainment of a few pupils 
may remain below a praiseworthy standard, finding nothing 
to praise in a pupil’s effort or attitude is confession of failure 
to secure his codperation, without which the school is not 
educating him. “Most pupils are doing about the best they 
can when we consider heredity, home environment, and their 
teacher, me,” would be a true and most useful philosophy for 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  6 The Technique of Teaching 
teachers to adopt. “The best they can” is not enough; it is 
the school’s business to furnish the experience which shall 
make this best better, upon a plane which only wholesome, 
human, expert teaching can reach. 
Recent changes in classroom ideals and technique. A visitor, 
familiar with school practice of a few decades ago, on stepping 
into the typical classroom of to-day, is impressed with the fact 
that, though excellent teaching always bears the same essential 
characteristics, the school of the present is different. It is 
not necessary to argue with those who prefer the old. Granting 
the success of the earlier régime, new times teach new duties 
and a modern school must, in its methods and spirit, reflect 
or be a part of present social life, utilizing the contributions of 
present-day scientific method as applied to school life and 
conditions. A teacher unaffected by current changes in educa- 
tion has small reason for being proud of immunity from fads. 
1. Recognition of motor activity. Adequate adjustments 
to the fact that pupils are dominantly motor have brought 
more athletics and manual studies. In lower grades games 
have large scope. Frequent short recesses and recreation 
periods are characteristic. The room “so quiet you can hear 
a pin drop” is not the ideal of any teacher who has felt the 
breath of modern educational life. Classrooms are becoming 
workrooms. Where a specific program has not broken the 
sedentary régime of schools as they were, teachers intersperse 
class work with physical drills, knowing that short periods 
of intense activity accomplish more than too long effort with 
accompanying fatigue and listlessness. 
2. Physical conditions related to classroom work. Pupils 
who cannot see what is on the blackboard or even in their 
own books are not teachable; testing hearing and eyesight 
are inseparably related to teaching. Sitting upon an uncom- 
fortable seat, in a cold or unventilated room or where light 
is inadequate makes concentration impossible. Under-  
-P-A-G-E-15
  
The Technique of Teaching a 
nourished pupils usually need more attention to proper food 
than to methods of teaching; those who are short of sleep would 
profit by reformation of their negligent parents. Both in 
the classroom and at home the problem of physical ability 
and condition is recognized as a fundamental element of 
instruction. 
3. Individual teaching—learning. Individual learning rather 
than mass teaching now holds recognition. Genuine educators 
have always realized that teaching and learning are only 
terminal points of the same activity, but class mechanics 
have too often obscured the fact that one is inseparable from 
the other. Much less is now said about the need of impartiality 
in dealing with pupils; no one thinks of insisting that all shall 
be treated alike since they are not all alike. Some would even 
do away with the entire class and grade organization in the 
interest of individual development, and there is general agree- 
ment that smaller groups make possible more vital education. 
Without accepting the psychology of individual differences 
as a justification of curriculum or method anarchy, no teacher 
can afford ignorance of its findings. Mechanical grading, 
fixed norms of performance for promotion, and lack of in- 
dividual acquaintance stand in the way of adapting method 
to specific pupil needs. 
4. Widened scope of instruction. The single textbook no 
longer occupies an exclusive position in American education. 
Supplementary material and the library have enriched or 
supplanted the one book plan. In a small way, the research 
ideal is being realized wherever teachers are skillfully directing 
the study of well organized units in which pupils find out all 
they can about a topic or problem, making a responsible report 
to teacher and classmates. Similarly, increased use of excur- 
sions, field trips, and visits to industrial establishments have 
brought into more general vogue the practice of studying real 
things directly.

5. The socialized recitation. The belief in self determination 
which accompanies the growth of democracy means, in essence, 
the substitution of inner for outer controls of conduct. The 
properly socialized individual is guided by principles developed 
through experience and integrally a part of his being rather 
than by the external force of authority. “The process of 
socialization, in which the process of education essentially 
consists, presents the two-fold aspect: (a) participation in 
the experience of others and the gradual recognition of the 
value of social life, (b) the achievement of power on the part 
of the individual to express himself in social directions.” ! 
Though no mathematical proof of the matter can be given, 
the opinion commends itself to serious consideration that 
sharing social responsibility in democratic society is best 
prepared for by increase of participation in the responsibility 
of classroom instruction. This the socialized recitation pro- 
vides. 
a. Responsibility in the socialized recitation. In any form 
which the socialized recitation may assume, the foundation 
element is responsibility to the group including the teacher. 
Whenever possible the content of what a pupil reads aloud 
is new to all but himself. He faces the class since it is his 
business to make them understand. He has no right to hesitate, 
mumble, or mispronounce because he is’ responsible to the 
class for being worth listening to. In a codperative under- 
taking like a room or class contest, a class play, conducting 
opening exercises or a special day program, the individual is 
responsible to the group, and the group to their own reputation 
as well as to the audience. The great difficulty with the teacher- 
centered recitation is that what happens often seems to make 
little difference; the teacher may not be pleased with one’s 
contribution, but after all what does that amount to? It is 
but a school reason—not a real one. An unfulfilled task in a 
1 MacVannell—Philosophy of Education, 118. a
-P-A-G-E-17
The Technique of Teaching 9 
socialized recitation may spoil a class undertaking; an exag- 
gerated statement or half-thought-out opinion is sure to be 
challenged, and a reason demanded. 
b. Conducting the socialized recitation. The group may be\, 
organized with a chairman and secretary; a pupil may be 
appointed by the teacher or elected by the class to lead in dis- 
cussion. In either case, the teacher, acting as parliamentarian, 
is a steadying influence to whom final appeal is made. In 
a typical situation, after a pupil makes his contribution to 
class discussion, several stand in their places without the 
customary waving of hands or asking of the teacher’s per- 
mission to speak. The chairman recognizes one who perhaps 
failed to understand a statement made by the speaker; another 
wishes to make a correction; and a third contributes additional 
information. Pupils question each other, playing the game 
according to recognized rules of order. The leader and each 
participating member is responsible to the class for making 
individual contributions also and for making the entire exer- 
cise worth while. Lapses in discipline due to uncontrolled 
enthusiasm are not hard to control by teachers who are 
strong enough to undertake socialized class work. The appeal 
is always the same, “You are wasting the time of the class 
to which you are responsible,” or “This is impolite and not 
according to rule”; back of this, usually implied only, “If 
you cannot play the game according to rule, we shall have to 
play without you for a while.” The same motives which prevail 
on the playground or in adult social life are thus made opera- 
tive in instruction. 
c. Dangers of the socialized recitation. (1) In common with 
every device of classroom organization, the socialized recita- 
tion is subject to its own peculiar dangers. The contributions 
of pupils who talk from the floor easily degenerate. Some 
resort to the familiar faultfinding about very small matters: 
“She said ‘There wasn’t no’ for ‘There wasn’t any’” or “He 
   
-P-A-G-E-18
  10 The Technique of Teaching 
didn’t let his voice fall” are typical. Others in order to be in 
the game force themselves to talk even though they have 
nothing to say, the result being trivialities. 
(2) Fragmentary and unorganized work is likely to be 
the consequence of pupil leadership. The leader can have no 
well thought out or far reaching plan; he cannot know accur- 
ately where he is going with his class and it requires magnificent 
skill for the teacher to furnish effectively a balanced outline 
without killing individual and group initiative. Carried away 
by pupil enthusiasm excellent teachers themselves often 
say “I’ve spent too much time upon that topic because the 
children were so interested in it.” Class enthusiasm is only 
partly a reliable guide: children may keep the discussion upon 
unimportant and unrelated material. Unskillfully directed, 
the plan wastes pupils’ time. 
(3) The socialized recitation offers little to insure participa- 
tion of all members of a class. Without skillful precautionary 
organization, the alert, intelligent, and dominating monopolize. 
The pupil leader being responsible is loath to inflict upon the 
group one who is slow or uninteresting, and a considerable 
proportion of many classes are content to sit in a tolerant, 
even apathetic attitude, being little receptive of what tran- 
spires among their more vocal and argumentative classmates. 
The unruffled calm of those for whom no problems arise is 
not to be disturbed by a pupil leader. | 
6. Project teaching. Teaching by projects introduces a 
useful term for which no definition of universal acceptance 
has been found. A project is called a “large topic,” “a problem,” 
or “a whole-hearted purposeful activity,” the last being so 
all-inclusive that it embraces attention to any topic a pupil 
may find of absorbing interest, “from homemade gingerbread 
to the League of Nations” as one writer has phrased the matter. 
Others think of project as applied only to activities in which 
something tangible is developed or created, manual training
-P-A-G-E-19
  The Technique of Teaching II 
or agriculture projects being legitimate examples. Generally 
speaking, project is taken to meana relatively complex problem, 
the solution of which is carried on in its natural setting. Project 
may very usefully be thought of as an attitude toward work 
regarded as an undertaking. 
a. Characteristic advantages of the project. (1) Project 
teaching may insure sustained effort upon large units. Even 
a puzzle as a project increases the attention span of the child 
who solves it. To construct, to find out, to solve a problem 
is not measured in pages; keeping an outline or bit of unrelated 
content for future need lacks the sustaining motive of present 
use. 
(2) The successful project must originate with or be adopted 
by the pupil. Responsibility for the results of a self-chosen 
undertaking is a powerful motive for carrying on. Not to 
miss a word for three months, to increase reading rate, to 
observe health card regulations, to win first place or honorable 
mention in an agricultural club enterprise, or to construct 
the model of a medieval castle are illustrations of such 
motivated activities. Most projects are not originally devised 
by pupils, for contrary to the inference of much which is 
written about child life, worth while problems seldom “spon- 
taneously arise”; educative projects are usually the result 
of expertly contrived situations in which pupils are led to 
adopt a problem for solution. To find out how the American 
colonists made their way into the Mississippi valley, or how 
much the family spends during a year are examples of adopted 
projects. Most of school experience is vicarious. The accom- 
plishments of the great have always been projects carried 
to success in the face of obstacles. Not infrequently reading 
of their struggles has far more educational value than en- 
deavoring to retrace the path they have climbed. 
(3) A project seriously undertaken necessitates persistent 
effort. To achieve the end sought, many means of but mediate
-P-A-G-E-20
  
13 The Technique of Teaching 
interest must be utilized. ‘To maintain a perfect spelling 
record, uninteresting words have to be studied; to make the 
finest garden, weeds must be pulled even though days are 
hot. “The most valuable result of education is the ability 
to make yourself do the thing you ought to do when it ought 
to be done whether you like it or not.” (Huxley.) Fears that 
education by projects will lack disciplinary value are ground- 
less. Responsibility for consequences is the most relentless 
of taskmasters. 
(4) Project teaching breaks isolation between subjects 
and between school and community. In executing a garden 
project, arithmetic in its natural setting is needed to count 
costs and measure the ground; letter writing is necessary 
in ordering seeds; and manual activities are constantly 
requisite. In beautifying school premises, help of the com- 
munity is enlisted; opening exercises carried on as a successful 
project utilize out-of-school contributors and attract visitors. 
If the use of related school subjects in a project is held toa 
high standard, and every opportunity seized to connect 
subjects which have an interesting though not necessarily 
integral relationship with each other, wide correlations may 
be brought about. 
b. Project teaching may permit trivial content. The prin- 
cipal danger to which project teaching is exposed is the 
noneducative value of much that is undertaken or the dis- 
proportionate emphasis likely to be given. Many class periods 
urgently needed for drill are spent in cooking or canning 
projects in which, to use Dewey’s phrase, pupils, merely 
“messing around,” accomplish little for themselves. Perhaps 
the jelly making hour, designed in part to motivate third 
grade language, requires the using of the language period to 
wash kettles. The project of beautifying the home town or 
city is commendable, but too much time devoted by children 
to picking up cans or refuse is barren of educational results.  
-P-A-G-E-21
The Technique of Teaching 13 
Home projects such as splitting kindling or making beds may 
have value in promoting ideals of perseverance in common 
with any tasks faithfully performed, but, once thoroughly done, 
the activities themselves have slight educational significance. 
c. Manual and constructive projects hard to evaluate. The 
manual activity or constructive project often associated 
with school subjects is peculiarly liable to deceive both pupils 
and teachers as to what is being accomplished. Building 
a model house in primary grades may have value in motivation 
of correlated measurements, and in language, spelling, and 
reading content. If conducted properly, its socializing value 
is as great as that of any other well organized codperative en- 
terprise. However, most of the time required for this project 
is devoted to leisurely play and should be so regarded. Such 
playhouse buildingisnot work. Thisisnotanindictmentagainst 
it, provided working hours are not unduly encroached upon. 
d. Manual projects not of universal interest. Manual proj- 
ects are supposed to be intrinsically more interesting because 
of instinctive tendencies of children to do and construct. 
Granting the general soundness of this view, many pupils, 
some of them the brightest, prefer intellectual effort 
to almost any subordinate manual project which may be 
devised. It is a mistake to assume that all dislike mental 
effort and need to be stimulated by handwork which is usually 
far less exacting in the amount of concentration it requires. 
The “instinct for thinking things out” may be a less universal ° 
endowment but it is surely as important in solving social 
problems .as any instinct which satisfies itself in tangible 
construction. The world needs thinkers as well as doers. ae 
Analysis of teaching purposes. In the last analysis, all 
schoolroom activities have one of the following purposes: 
1. Instruction,in which knowledge and judgment are prominent. 
For the sake of brevity the term “instruction” will be used in 
this sense throughout this volume.  
-P-A-G-E-22
14 The Technique of Teaching 
2. Instruction consisting largely of drill, for permanent re- 
tention, habit formation, or skill. 
3. Development of ideals and attitudes. 
The first and the second are fairly distinct as to appropriate 
method procedure; the third is an effect of entire situations. 
A single class exercise may shift from instruction to drill 
without a break, but the intelligent teacher knows when 
change of purpose is made. Each of the three teaching pur- 
poses utilizes its own technique, each is best comprehended 
through a specific study involving its legitimate professional 
terminology. Such a discussion follows. 
Instruction. 1. Logical and psychological organization. 
Given reasonably accurate acquaintance with the pupils’ 
mental content so that too much or too little may not be 
expected, and with his immediate “set” so that approach 
may be made in harmony with apperceptive backgrounds, 
the larger problems of instruction are those of organization 
of subject matter and its effective presentation. That all 
teaching content should be psychologically organized is an 
educational truism. Psychologizing subject matter means 
reducing it to the order of pupil logic. How far this may 
differ from that of the adult varies with class and subject, 
but in many cases the logical and psychological coincide. 
The ill-founded fear of some teachers lest they present a 
systematic and severely logical outline may be responsible 
for confused teaching; psychological does not mean illogical. 
For young teachers and those offering newly organized courses, 
an excellent ideal is, “I will teach nothing which I cannot 
outline.” This would insure logical sequence. A corresponding 
ideal for older instructors or those who deal with highly 
organized subjects is, “I will lose no opportunity to give this 
subject significance by connecting it with the pupils’ daily 
life.” This would mean the psychological order. 
2. Inductive movement. In organizing subject matter for
-P-A-G-E-23
  
The Technique of Teaching 15 
teaching or in making lesson plans, induction soon emerges 
as a mental movement. Induction seeks explanation of ob- 
served facts. After directed observation, discussion, develop- 
ment, and analysis, pupil or class formulates a hypothesis; 
if this, upon further observation, is verified it becomes a gener- 
alization, a concept, definition, rule, principle, or process. 
Because pupils usually have half-formed notions even upon 
what we present as new, it is difficult to discover all the process 
of induction. Much of it has taken place before we present 
our little unit of subject matter. Frequently the notion 
already formed is inaccurate and needs reconstruction or 
correction only, whereas most teachers in analyzing their 
work to find inductive procedure, look for distinctly new 
units. If in the mind or plan of the instructor, there is a 
general truth, or process, which pupils are expected to acquire, 
through development, the movement is inductive. In the 
examples which follow, much of the process may be carried 
on during a class period. Many generalizations, unlike these, 
are the result of years of observation and experience. Such 
are most moral judgments which furnish the intellectual 
background of our attitudes. Appreciation of courage or 
fidelity usually develops from acquaintance with many 
exemplifications of the quality admired. It is for the same 
reason, slow inductive development, that it is often said, 
“You cannot teach honesty.” Of a single lesson or series of 
lessons the statement may be true, but the honesty charac- 
teristic of the majority of pupils in any schoolroom is the 
result of inductive experience. 
In considering the examples given, note that the beginning 
of any inductive lesson plan is the “generalization aimed at,” 
the teacher’s aim. Clear determination of this goal prescribes 
all contributing procedure; the length of the lesson must be 
sufficient to accomplish this purpose; every illustration or 
device must be related to or in harmony with this end.

tion, or classification. Instead of an abstract generalization, 
many cases are settled by reference to a type or single well 
known instance which stands for the general concept. In a 
certain stage, all patriots are discovered by resemblance to

Characteristics of inductive and deductive exercises. It 
is evident that all instruction involves legitimate use 
of inductive and deductive procedure. “How, why, make 
a definition for, explain, describe, compare, find out” are likely 
to indicate induction; “solve, select, list, name, classify, 
prove” speak the language of deduction. Spending time use- 
lessly developing what is familiar to every pupil and merely 
needs summarizing is the besetting sin of those who endeavor 
to throw all class work into an inductive mold. Announcing 
without explanation an entirely unfamiliar concept or general- 
ization, expecting pupils to comprehend and employ it, repre- 
sents the waste of relying too exclusively upon deduction.

18 The Technique of Teaching 
Intelligent instruction demands ability to recognize at every 
stage the fundamental elements of the process, and to select 
technique appropriate. Unanalyzed instruction is likely to 
be blind. 
Drill. 1. Function of habituation. The purpose of drill 
is to insure permanent retention, habit, or skill. It is required 
when we wish to besure of memorizing, or of ready and automatic 
performance; it is not opposed to thinking but makes that 
activity unnecessary. Clearly there are fields in which exercise 
of judgment would be a burden; we think when uncertain. 
Nothing could be gained but a great deal lost by being un- 
certain about the elementary combinations in arithmetic, 
the spelling of common words, or the mechanics of punctua- 
tion; these are not situations for thought. There is no evi- 
dence that thorough drill in fundamental mechanics ever de- 
prived pupils of the qualities of initiative or independence which 
the school is sometimes accused of not encouraging sufficiently; 
on the other hand many have wasted precious time which 
might have been devoted to thought content or constructive 
projects because of lacking skill in mechanical elements. 
2. Psychology of drill. Situations demanding drill technique 
are clearly enough differentiated to be recognized easily. . 
The essential principles of drill may be set forth distinctly 
and applied consciously even by pupils themselves, although 
they might find understanding of the process of instruction 
impossible. i 
a. Focalize upon what is to be memorized or reduced to 
automatism. See that the poem is understood, stress the 
correct language form, place specifically before pupils the 
combinations to be mastered. All drill is specific. 
6. Repeat with attention the correct form. Repetition 
with minimum attention brings minimum results. Half an 
exercise one hundred per cent correct is more effective than 
all of it “just about” right.
-P-A-G-E-27
  The Technique of Teaching 19 
c. Permit no relapses, exceptions, or wrong responses in 
repetition. 
d. Motive for practice must be initial. It is likely to need 
reinforcement when plateaus in the learning curve have been 
reached. The pupil who seems to have redthedhi 
needs new incentives. Varied devices such as fii 
limits, excelling previous records, and use of group rivalry 
are effective. 
e. Subordinate but important drill precepts may be added 
in amplification of those just noted. 
(1) Short drill periods are most effective. 
(2) Snap and immediate response rather than deliberation 
characterize drill. 
(3) Drill upon every element. 
(4) Give most practice to the more difficult elements. 
(5) Practice correct forms; repeating the incorrect fixes 
the incorrect. j 
(6) Repeat somewhat oftener than seems necessary to 
secure the habit plane. Underlearning is more common than 
overlearning. { 
(7) Secure repetition at gradually increasing intervals 
to hold and strengthen bonds. / 
Ideals and attitudes. “Ideals are ways we have of 
figuring to ourselves the outreaching and ever-expanding 
values of our concrete acts.” They are the result of thinking 
of ourselves as we should like to be. Attitudes are our emo- 
tional set of approval or disapproval. Ideal and attitude 
together all but determine character. “Character is that body 
of active tendencies and interests in the individual which 
make him open, ready, warm to certain aims, and callous, cold, 
blind.to others, and which accordingly habitually tend to make 
him acutely aware of and favorable to certain sorts of conse- 
quences, and ignorant of or hostile to other consequences.”! 
1 Dewey and Tufts—Ethics, 255. 
       
   
-P-A-G-E-28
  20 The Technique of Teaching 
Study of the foregoing paragraph reveals the reason for 
insisting that the most important part of education is emo- 
tional; ideals determine what the individual is purposely 
aware of, sanctions, approves, believes in, admires, or enjoys. 
Intellectual principles furnished by instruction are useful 
methods of judging, but decision rests with emotional set. In 
literature, history, and art, potential ideals are present for 
which skilled teaching must secure approval. Appreciation of 
the best is the effect desired whether found in school activities, 
in personal example, or through the medium of lesson content. 
Unlike instruction and drill, no well established technique 
can be described by which ideals and attitudes may be fostered. 
The influence of many homes is neutral toward instruction, 
inertly an obstacle to the objects of drill applied to over- 
coming unfortunate language habits, and occasionally power- 
fuliy in opposition to the social attitude society most needs 
to develop. No one can effectively command pupils to approve 
the right and condemn the wrong in a historical or literary 
situation, but skilled teachers secure these emotional reactions. 
Immediate expression of attitude is not desirable if it must 
be forced. Enthusiasm is contagious; what is lacking in 
technique may be made up by the genuine enthusiasm and 
cultivated taste of teachers who use every incidental means 
to make right attitudes integral in the character of their 
pupils. Knowledge that what pupils care for rather than 
what they know will determine their career and usefulness” 
as citizens, should reflect itself in every teaching activity; 
attitude is the whole which is greater than any part. 
Lesson plans. 1. For instruction. Without plan, teaching 
goes on blindly. The elaborate written plans of the followers 
of Herbart have given place to greater diversity; adaptation 
is made to immediate needs of class and to character of subject 
matter. If an exercise is to be dominantly instructional its 
plan should usually contain at least the following:
-P-A-G-E-29
  The Technique of Teaching 21 
a. The teacher's aim. Formulating this involves clear 
appreciation of the functional value of what is to be presented, 
a knowledge of the pupil’s apperceptive basis for appropriating 
the new experience, and recognition of the inductive or deduc- 
tive movement in the lesson. The pupil’s aim is sometimes 
worthy of special statement though his real and immediate 
purpose is often without educational significance. 
b. Organization of subject matter. This can seldom follow 
exact textbook order since no specific class was in the mind 
of even the most skillful author. There is, however, no merit 
in willful destruction of a well-ordered sequence merely to 
be original or different; as has been shown the logical order 
may also be psychological. 
c. Pivotal questions. These in the large can be formulated 
beforehand; likewise the general answers expected may be 
forecast, with full knowledge that actual class work may 
depart widely from anticipated sequence. 
d. Provision for summaries. These afford opportunity for 
emphasizing and fixing what is most important. 
e. The lesson plan may end in an assignment. In some very 
excellent present-day teaching the entire lesson constitutes 
an assignment of the problems to be attacked. 
2. For drill. If the lesson plan is for a drill exercise, all 
devices must be prepared in harmony with the principles 
of effective habit formation and so planned as to move with 
snap and vigor. In any plan, all teaching accessories must 
be made ready; avoid interest-killing delays and interruptions. 
The assignment. 1. Essential qualities. Lesson assignments 
should be clear, definite, specific. Pupils should know exactly 
what is expected; this may have reference both to amount 
and quality of work; the assignment should be of reasonable 
length and only best efforts accepted. 
2. The assignment should furnish motive. Positive, vigorous 
manner and voice, added to the knowledge that all’ will be
-P-A-G-E-30
  22 The Technique of Teaching 
held rigidly to account, are usually sufficient to insure willirig 
performance. Problem and project assignments at their best 
are self-inspiring, and in all vital teaching, interest in the 
activities undertaken is the fundamental motive. 
3. Specific aid. The assignment points out specific diffi- 
culties and indicates the source of help in their mastery. 
Obstacles not reasonably sure to be troublesome for most 
pupils should not be discussed, but should be left for in- 
dividual treatment. Points which no pupil is likely to com- 
prehend should not be left as study stumbling blocks; they 
should be disposed of by adequate explanation. The same is 
true of essential relationships which no member of a class 
is likely to discover unaided. 
4. Individual assignments. Individual assignments fix 
responsibility. Making one member of a class responsible 
for a problem or project is, however, easily interpreted to 
mean that all others are exempt. 
5. Flexible assignments. Flexible assignments, requiring 
a certain minimum of work and recommending additional 
effort from those who have time or ability, free nervous or 
weak pupils from the needless strain of fixed stipulations. 
They utilize also the motive of emulation, while making 
allowance for individual differences. 
The study period. In the typically organized school, the 
study period represents the pupils’ direct contact with books. 
Solving arithmetic problems, memorizing a poem, studying 
spelling lists, and writing sentences according to assigned 
requirements, represent study. Much of such activity is 
futile because the assignment sentences pupils to labor upon 
unprofitable material, fails to make clear what is expected, 
or is defective in motivation. Pupils of unsatisfactory scholar- 
ship do not know how to study, and few who achieve superior 
records know how they secure results. Except in most general 
terms few teachers know how to aid children in study, and
-P-A-G-E-31
The Technique of Teaching 23 
éducational literature on the subject is far richer in providing 
administration of study groups than in showing teachers how 
to improve pupils’ study economy. Technique of study 
lessons varies with the nature of lesson content. Here are 
presented a few suggestions generally applicable. In connec- 
tion with each subject treated in later chapters, more specific 
treatment is given. 
1. Concentration. Study requires concentration; it is 
vigorous activity. If the school day is properly interspersed 
with relaxation periods, there is no excuse for dawdling while 
supposedly studying. Premium should be placed upon accom- 
plishing the maximum in a short period and upon beginning 
work without prolonging the warming-up period too generally 
considered necessary. A long time spent in mastering a lesson 
is not a matter for pride unless the task assigned is extended 
or difficult. 
2. Systematic study. Encourage a systematic study pro- 
gram. “I forgot” and “I didn’t have time” will be heard less 
frequently if preparation of each lesson has a place in the 
day’s routine. 
3. Lack of reading ability an obstacle. Inability of pupils 
to study effectively may often be attributed to the fact that 
they cannot read intelligently or have not learned the eco- 
nomical use of the dictionary. The presence of half a dozen 
words which a pupil cannot even pronounce in each paragraph 
of a history assignment is a very serious obstacle. Even 
those who can read fairly well may be unable to judge the 
worth or relation of important statements. Class periods 
devoted to the study technique of each subject represent 
economy, but only individual diagnoses and specific coaching 
can put some pupils in the way of overcoming their own diffi- 
culties. 
4. The waste of underlearning. The waste of underlearning 
merits attention in every school and with most pupils. The
-P-A-G-E-32
  24 The Technique of Teaching 
added effort necessary to fix permanently what is learned, 
apparently, for but a day pays the largest dividends. 
5. Necessity of reflective thinking. With most content sub- 
jects, thinking deliberately, reflecting, is essential for achieving 
results. Many pupils are not satisfied unless industriously 
occupied with some tangible activity. They read the lesson 
over several times with as little thought as possible, copy 
passage after passage mechanically, and give the matter no 
further thought the minute these motor activities cease. 
Such pupils, with all their show of intelligent industry, should 
be convinced that their method is wrong. Study needs the 
mind. 
6. Home study. Home study is not satisfactorily disposed 
of when pupils carry home a load of books. In numbers there 
is dissipation of effort. Better results usually accrue when a 
schedule of home preparation assignments is announced and 
systematically adhered to — arithmetic, Monday; geography, 
Tuesday; perhaps with spelling a constant since it lends 
itself to conditions of home study. Deductive exercises, such 
as applying principles or rules, are more suitable for home 
study than the attacking of new problems. Worth while 
assistance from parents cannot be too confidently reckoned 
upon. Ignorant parents are incapable. Many others, both 
wise and unwise, think they are too busy to assist their chil- 
dren. Work in which wrong notions may easily be formed 
should be kept at school where it may be supervised. 
7. Supervised study. Supervised study has come into vogue 
because of the evident waste both at home and in school 
in unsupervised study. A successful technique in this field 
has not been developed among teachers generally. . With the 
lengthened class period which is the necessary eocian einen 
of supervised study organization, many instructors merely 
prolong the period into a recitation of double length, thus 
bringing about the elimination of individual study. Others
-P-A-G-E-33
  
The Technique of Teaching 25 
teach for half the period, confining their efforts to maintaining 
discipline for the rest of the time. Much which has been 
called supervised study is only a clumsy adaptation of an old 
procedure. Expecting the typical keeper of a study hall to 
conduct supervised study in miscellaneous subjects is absurd. 
To supervise study one must be recently familiar with every 
line with which pupils are wrestling, know what happened 
in class yesterday, and what is planned for to-morrow. 
The most serious danger of supervised study is that of 
pauperizing those who are being helped. It requires great 
skill to discover which pupils need personal assistance, and 
which should be refused help. As a rule, pupils should not 
be permitted to ask for aid, since some would put forth no 
effort which could be shifted. The skilled supervisor, well 
acquainted -with a class, soon learns how to stimulate indi- 
viduals by assistance judiciously rendered or withheld. With 
experts as supervisors, pupils grow in ability to put forth 
sustained and independent effort. Unless supervised study 
like all other forms of teaching technique is gradually making 
pupils independent of their instructors it is not accomplishing 
its purpose. 
8. Study problems and directions. In all grades there is 
increased probability of sustained study effort if the original 
motivation of the assignment is reinforced by a series of prob- 
lems, projects, or exercises which pupils are directed to per- 
form. Suggestions are offered for these in connection with 
the teaching of each subject treated in subsequent chapters. 
All such exercises should meet the technical requirements of 
questions presented in the next paragraph. It may be noted 
that when it comes to framing stimulating study questions 
or problems, teachers often unconsciously do worse than they 
know, merely because of the fatigue involved in dictating, 
writing, typing, or placing on the blackboard thought-inciting 
questions, The conception of a study question as consisting  
-P-A-G-E-34
  
Serene eee 
Se = o 
26 The Technique of Teaching 
of one or a few lines needs modification; it may well consist of 
a paragraph necessary to build up an appropriate background 
for the problem at its close. Such questions should not be 
more unusual than the long periods of exposition or explana- 
tion recognized as legitimate in teacher-pupil oral discussions. 
Question and answer. 1. Scope and adaptation. Question- 
ing has always occupied an important place in teaching. 
The term is loosely, but without confusion, employed to include 
much which has no interrogatory form as “Name the states 
which border upon the Atlantic Ocean,” or “Add six and nine; 
four and eight,” or “Tell why the main lines of railroad 
usually run east and west rather than north and south.” 
Questions must be framed with regard to class, pupil, and 
character of work. All questioning in class teaching must 
primarily consider the group to which it is addressed; but in 
a properly planned lesson, every question can meet the 
individual need of the pupil who is called upon. 
Questions in drill exercises are usually brief and may 
properly be given in rapid succession, answers not necessarily 
being complete sentences; there are no problems, topics, nor 
thought questions in strictly drill exercises. Clear recognition 
of what is being attempted is the surest guide to ques- 
tioning. 
2. Form of questions. Teachers’ questions should be clear, 
concise, definite, and framed in the briefest form that may be 
expected to bring anticipated results. It is usually better to 
discard entirely an unsatisfactory question, if one has been 
asked, and start again, instead of trying to patch or amend. 
3. Undesirable types. Because they occasion little thought, 
direct, leading, alternating, elliptical, and allobyious questions 
are to be avoided. “Is it right to smoke cigarettes?” (Direct) ; 
“It’s wrong, isn’t it?” (Leading); “Is it right or wrong?” 
(Alternating); “To smoke —————? is injurious to the 
?” (Elliptical), illustrate these forms which are more 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
The Technique of Teaching 27 
often heard in humdrum or hurried teaching than one who 
has not observed many schoolrooms may suppose. 
4. What and when, or how and why? Why and how questions 
demanding thought may well be increased at the expense 
of what, when, and where questions calling for facts. Properly 
framed the thought question may be made to call for use of 
facts. The challenging value of why and how is strong, es- 
pecially if they are employed to introduce a problem based 
upon a situation previously built up. 
5. Sequence in questioning. Skilled questioning is based 
upon a reasoned sequence prescribed by the nature of the 
subject matter. In an instruction exercise, if the teacher 
pauses, saying, “What should my next question-be?” most 
pupils should be able to predict, if not the exact words, at 
least the general content of what is to be elicited by the forth- 
coming question. Obviously, sequence is less apparent in 
the specific questions of a drill lesson. 
6.. Manner of asking questions. Questions should be asked 
before pronouncing the pupil’s name, a pause following each 
question. Promiscuous rather than fixed rotation in reaching 
pupils, stimulates attention. While an equal number of oppor- 
tunities to contribute may not be given to all, since pupils differ 
widely in capacity to profit by participation, the bright should 
not monopolize, the dull should not be ignored. To encourage 
those whose intellectual morale is low, a judicious qualitative 
apportionment of questions is permissible so that an occasional 
moderate success is possible for all. A hurried manner or tone, 
and inflection indicating doubt or defiance of a pupil’s ability 
exert a negative influence. Questions are to develop or test 
rather than to convict. The question directed toward an in- 
attentive pupil off guard is an act of discipline, not of teaching. 
7. Pupils’ questions. Pupils should and do ask questions 
of vital content in every live class exercise. The degree to 
which they spontaneously contribute in this way has not  
-P-A-G-E-36
28 The Technique of Teaching 
unreasonably been proposed as an index of the vitality of 
the class exercise. Measured by this standard, a well directed 
socialized recitation takes high rank. 
8. Pupils’ answers. Pupils’ answers should not be guesses, 
though if questions are bad enough they cannot well be any- 
thing else. In an instruction exercise, answers should usually 
come after deliberation. Properly framed questions are not 
immediately followed by a sea of waving hands. If the ques- 
tion asked is answered, the instructor should be content, 
though only a hardy spirit would venture deliberately to , 
give the answer called for by many awkward questioners. 
The teacher who is resourceful in bringing the right response 
from an unpromising beginning is a rare artist, provided this 
is accomplished without “pumping.” Such expressions as, 
“and many other things,” “and so forth,” “I understand but 
I can’t explain it,” “You know what I mean,” and “I know but 
I can’t tell” should be promptly laid under ban since they 
deceive their users and instructors as well. Teachers are guilty 
when they prompt unduly or say, “That’s all right; I know 
what you mean,” after every lame attempt of an unprepared 
pupil. It may also be noted that the very common practice 
of repeating pupils’ answers contributes the monotony of a 
voice inevitably heard too often, and dulls responsibility for 
clear utterance. Why worry if the teacher is going to repeat 
it all? 
Illustrative media. Teaching is so strongly a verbal process 
that every reasonable expedient must be employed to make 
it vivid and realistic. Making paper cups or sand pile moun- 
tains is more vivid than talking about them. Setting out a 
tree is more vital than a lecture upon tree planting.. Scoring 
poultry appeals when study of a diagram palls. Field trips 
and excursions, taking the class to the object of interest, 
specimens brought into the classroom, the use of pictures, 
graphs, maps and globes, charts and diagrams, experiments,
-P-A-G-E-37
  The Technique of Teaching 29 
and illustrative stories all need serious consideration by teach- 
ers who would master the technique of their use. Too generally 
these are incidents not regarded as essential nor depended 
upon to perform specific function. Visual instruction through 
lantern slides and moving picture films is performing an im- 
portant, though unmeasured service. 
The blackboard, universally at hand in American school- 
rooms, is but half utilized because the technique of its use 
is fully mastered by very few teachers. A course in black- 
board sketching should be part of the training required of 
every instructor. Meanwhile critical self-examination, with 
blackboard efficiency the objective, should reveal opportunity 
for growth. Effective use of colored crayon to emphasize 
dates or important principles, to distinguish original work 
from corrections, and to bring out essential relationships is 
a feature worthy of study. Incidental memorizing is econom- 
ically brought about by a somewhat permanent blackboard 
display for casual study. Skillful organization of blackboard 
questions and problems may reduce the teacher’s vocal 
participation to a desirable minimum. 
Written work. Throughout this book it is maintained that 
most schoolrooms have too much written work.) Pupils 
dislike it, postpone it whenever possible, or find the line of 
least resistance by copying a classmate’s effort. Even the 
nine-tenths which is honestly but rather stupidly done in- 
cludes waste of effort because the excessive amount renders 
careful supervision impossible. If the teacher conscientiously 
devotes all evening hours to individual corrections in red 
ink, the more necessary daily preparation may be slighted. 
If pupils profit not in the least by these carefully made cor- 
rections we have a case of conspicuous but not unheard-of 
educational waste. A pupil who has formed the notebook 
habit, by a few lines of hurried scribbling disposes of material 
which should be thought through and made his own.
-P-A-G-E-38
  30 The Technique of Teaching 
Notwithstanding its limitations and peculiar dangers, 
much written work must be done. Written lessons make sure 
that all have had opportunity for expression. Learning to 
do written work is a primary school purpose based upon social 
needs. In general, less writing should be done, but what is 
required should be far more closely and’ conscientiously 
supervised with full recognition that oversight of a reasonable 
minimum makes heavy but legitimate demand upon the teach- 
er’s time. The amount of individual paper correcting should 
be intelligently proportioned to the educational return from 
such effort. Class discussion with blackboard correction of 
typical errors is more effective and economical than toil- 
some repetition of individual markings.) First being clear 
as to the worthwhile purpose of all required written tasks, 
it is reasonable to see them correctly done; but neither teachers 
nor pupils can afford tobe unintelligent slaves of written work. 
Testing results. Educational results must be measured if 
we are to know intelligently what progress is being made. 
While each subject has a special testing technique, the four 
means which follow are to some extent applicable in all. 
1. Use in correlated. subjects. The results of instruction 
and drill are tested by use in the correlated subjects of the 
curriculum. Arithmetic may be needed in composition, geog- 
raphy is needed in history, and spelling and composition in 
all subjects requiring written work. Such testing is frequently 
the most reliable, since it is based upon the pupil’s ability 
to use his capital when a situation demands it. 
2. The classroom quiz. Results are tested in class work. 
Effective test of previous preparation may be made by a few 
planned testing questions well directed. In general, too much 
time is devoted to such quizzing which is nevertheless not 
thoroughly done because of the lack of systematic preparation 
on the part of teachers. More teaching and less testing repre- 
sents the ideal for the forward-looking recitation.

3. Examinations. Examinations are the conventional 
school tests. They have been abused; their per cent of accuracy 
in determining results is not high; as the sole means of de- 
termining fitness for promotion, they have been universally 
discarded; despite all this, they are of value when intelli- 
gently used. 
a. Examinations aré but one test of accomplishment. 
b. The nervous strain of examination should be minimized 
—not aggravated by threat of failure. Option of several 
questions from a list usually seems to afford relief. 
c. Questions should be in close harmony with the actual 
curriculum as conducted by the classroom teacher. Well 
prepared pupils are not greatly surprised at the content of 
reasonable examinations. 
d. Questions should be so clearly framed as to contain not 
the slightest ambiguity. Interpretation of the question may 
then be rated part of the test. A wise precaution is to place 
no examination before pupils until it has been proof-read and 
approved by two or more competent judges of content and 
form. 
e. Teachers should cease to berate examinations or apol- 
ogize for their use. Energy is better spent in improving 
examination procedure. 
4. Standardized tests and scales. By determining standards 
actually attained under representative conditions, measure- 
ment of educational results has been placed upon a moderately 
scientific and objective basis. These tests eliminate undue 
influence of local and personal factors; they make comparisons 
between rooms and systems practicable; they measure progress 
from grade to grade upon an absolute basis. Of the subjects 
treated in this volume useful and fairly reliable tests have 
been developed in spelling, reading, composition, and arith- 
metic; geography and history present a far more difficult 
problem. Speaking generally, drill content is easily tested;

afforded physical exercise for students who were not being mentally exer- 
cised.. Teacher talked at a student, asking a question now and then and 
answering it himself. The questions themselves were execrable, one of 
them being, “This, that, and the other happened, did it not?” All of what 
the teacher said was taken from the textbook lying open upon each student’s 
desk, though none seemed interested in it or in the class exercise. In words 
used by teacher and student, a ten minute record of the class was thus repre- 
sented.

11. Observation of a skilled instructor is one of the most effective means 
of self improvement. Visits should not be hurried; little is to be gained ina 
few minutes and such flitting disturbs class work. A negative attitude is 
sometimes blind, as the visitor looking for faults is unlikely to dis- 
cover those he himself commits. In order to sharpen your critical ability 
endeavor to discover the faults and strong points listed here in the work of 
the most expert teacher you have opportunity to visit. In the work of the 
least skilled. Compare the records. How many of these faults would an 
expert visitor find in your teaching? What others might be added? Which 
of the strong points characterize your teaching? 
a. Depending too much upon textbooks. 
6. Falling behind the assignment. 
Repeating questions. 
. Repeating pupils’ answers. 
Calling only upon bright or aggressive pupils.

CHAPTER TWO 
THE TEACHING OF SPELLING 
Function of spelling. 1. Primary. The primary function 
of spelling is to indicate by phonetic characters the sound of 
words. Talking preceded writing; pictographs and ideographs 
involved no real spelling. They represent a stage which poor 
spellers might like to experience—writing without the necessity 
of spelling. The evolution of more or less phonetic alphabets 
such as ours brought spelling troubles; but, in spite of all 
variations, orthography roughly indicates pronunciation. 
Language grows; pronunciation changes from generation 
to generation; but since the invention of printing, spelling 
tends in a much greater degree to remain constant. 
Good nature and good sense must ever join, 
To err*is human; to forgive divine 
probably constituted a perfect rhyme when written by Pope 
but both the spelling and pronunciation “jine” are now out- 
lawed. However, through mistakes of dictionary makers, anx- 
ious to preserve “derivation,” useless and awkward, unreason- 
able, unphonetic spellings have been adopted and continued. 
Foreign words are brought into our language bodily; and, 
though none of us make them sound much like themselves, 
our pronunciation of words like chauffeur or garage often bears 
scant relation to their spelling. Thus through growth of lan- 
guage, through mistakes and misapplied zeal of lexicographers, 
andfrom constant borrowing of foreign words, English spelling 
is so irregular that we are tempted to forget what spelling 
primarily is for —to indicate the sound of written words. 
‘There would be no spelling if words were not written.

  38 The Technique of Teaching 
2. Criticisms of results achieved in school. Uncritical opinion 
rather generally renders an unfavorable verdict upon the 
schools as teachers of spelling. For this attitude not a few 
unconvincing reasons are cited, but alert teachers need to 
sift carefully what appear to be groundless faultfindings. We 
shall understand our pupils better even though the criticism 
proves to be only smoke; occasionally a discerning bit of 
censure of our methods helps us. 
a. There is the human tendency to glorify the past. “There 
were giants in those days” — giants as judged by spelling 
match standards. Of course the story of such contests is 
always the record of champions, and there is little testimony 
as to how the rank and file used their spelling ability. Such 
evidence as is available is not unfavorable to the effectiveness 
of present day teaching. 
b. There is the well-known tendency of parents to be 
suspicious of changed methods. The accompanying quotation 
indicates this; it also proves that pessimistic criticism is not 
perhaps more in evidence now than in the past.    
        
    Why is it that there are so few really good spellers? I have 
sometimes thought that the evil of incorrect spelling was rapidly in- 
creasing of late. A foolish prejudice against the good old “Spelling 
Book” having obtained in many places (countenanced, I am sorry 
to say, by some good teachers), the evil effects are already seen. 
Men may ridicule the old-fashioned “up column and down column” 
as much as they please; there are certainly more bad spellers 
where this method has been entirely abandoned than elsewhere. 
3 I am fully prepared to say that in my opinion, the ban- 
ishment of this form of knowledge is a very great mistake. (New 
York Teachers Advocate, Vol. I, 1845. 246.) 
c. All the children of all the people are now in school and 
must be taught to spell. Spelling ability is not more universall: 
distributed perhaps than capacity for becoming rich or holdin; 
office. The per cent of good spellers among those of who: 
anything was expected probably was greater when only
-P-A-G-E-47
  
The Teaching of Spelling 39 
select group attended school, but the total number of accurate 
spellers is probably greater than ever before. 
d. More subjects are now taught than formerly; therefore, 
it is reasoned, there must be less time for each. By inference 
less must be accomplished. It is probable that less time is 
now wasted upon useless spelling, and that better method 
economy is practiced. 
e. The “business man’s criticism” may be partly explained 
by the fact that he often judges the school’s effectiveness 
by the economically dependent whom he can employ; the 
best spellers are likely to continue in school. The business 
man also forgets how much he has learned since leaving school 
—certainly most of any technical vocabulary which he uses. 
If one could dictate to the merchant the letters sent from the 
office of a city superintendent or from a dog-fancier’s estab- 
lishment for a week and compare results with the new office 
boy’s spelling the comparison might be interesting. This 
is very far from indicating the conclusion that the public 
schools are without fault in the training of the boy. 
3. Secondary function of spelling. A secondary — not 
second — function is to spell according to accepted conven- 
tional standards, however irrational and uneconomical. It 
is not possible to justify expenditure of energy in learning 
to spell by the fact that incorrect spelling might be mis- 
understood since so much is read from context. While one 
misspelling in a thousand might cause a real misunderstanding, 
the other nine hundred and ninety-nine cases would merely 
— but quite as painfully — submit the writer to ridicule or 
stamp him as an ignoramus. The stenographer who begins 
a letter “Dear cur” or “Dear cir” would not be discharged 
because of misunderstanding but because of unconventional 
orthography. The too oft-cited horse dealer who sent a heavey 
horse because his customer did not spell heavy correctly 
was not fooled by the added letter — he was indulging in 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  40 The Technique of Teaching 
a sharp trade. It is possible to be understood without being 
able to spell. 
“Spelling satisfies the law of conspicuous waste.” (Veblen.) 
“Spelling is not essentially better for culture than carpentry,” 
says Thorndike. We ridicule persons who are so pedantic as 
to be willing to fight over the spelling of a word, but we are 
likely to have scant regard for one who writes us a poorlyspelled 
letter. The accompanying quotation, now nearly a hundred 
years old, represents the unspoken content of many minds. 
The time was when bad spelling in any one claiming to be well 
educated, was considered to be unpardonable. To me it seems so 
yet, for, being brought up under the old dispensation, I was taught 
to think incorrect spelling was a mark of ignorance. I never shall 
forget my feelings on seeing some time since, a letter of a couple of 
pages from a distinguished member of the United States Senate— 
which contained nine words incorrectly spelt. Since that time it is 
with the greatest difficulty that I can think that man great in any 
sense of the word, 
Present status of spelling. Though proper spelling is less 
important than correct speaking or than having something 
worth while to write, its conventional importance is so great 
that one can no more afford to be a poor speller than to be 
guilty of bad manners in any other way. “Thou shalt not 
misspell” is not one of the Ten Commandments, but schools 
are more harshly criticised because pupils violate this injunc- 
tion than because they err in weightier matters. 
1. Current influences upon teaching spelling. Among causes 
which may have affected unfavorably the teaching of spelling 
may be mentioned the agitation for spelling reform. If 
spelling is to be changed over night, why worry? This “why 
worry” fits too well with another cause, strong opposition 
to memoriter methods in school work. Spelling is largely a 
memory subject, for no.amount of reasoning, motivation, 
project making, or economical association can avoid the neces-
-P-A-G-E-49
ee re ee oN 
The Teaching of Spelling 41 
sity of remembering many inconsistent and slightly related 
combinations. In individual cases the writing of shorthand 
and the study of foreign language doubtless result in the 
misspelling of certain words. 
2. Spelling is well taught. The sensitiveness of teachers 
probably exaggerates the amount of unfavorable comment; 
most lay judges perhaps do not consider the teaching of spell- 
ing worse than formerly, but educators themselves have long 
. been convinced that there is room for great improvement. 
Attempts have been made to substitute scientific measure- 
ment for opinion based upon individual impressions. Numer- 
ous scales and tests have been devised, and all teachers are 
aware that significant measurement of spelling ability must 
be based upon written work in which the pupil’s attention 
is not primarily upon spelling. With this ideal, the spelling 
class may require only ten minutes but spelling consciousness 
lasts all day and follows pupils home. 
What spelling includes. Strictly speaking, spelling includes 
only naming or writing letters in proper sequence (orthog- 
raphy), but pronunciation (orthoépy) and knowledge of 
meaning or use of words (philology) are so closely related to 
effective teaching that they must for practical purposes be 
considered part of the process. “Pupils cannot spell what they 
cannot pronounce;” “a word correctly pronounced: is half 
spelled.” Though many have learned to spell correctly long 
lists of words with no conception of their meaning, such learn- 
ing does not usually represent teaching economy. 
The psychology of spelling. 1. Automatism the goal. A 
“good speller” is one who writes correctly and automatically 
the words he uses. Habit formation is the essential process. 
The ideal is to spell all commonly used words without think- 
ing. Properly acquired spelling habits run themselves and 
wrong spelling requires an effort. “Be careless of your spelling” 
would not be safe advice, but until one reaches the stage in 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  42 The Technique of Teaching 
which he takes no thought for the spelling of ordinary words; 
i.e., is without care, he has not learned to spell. 
2. Habit formation in spelling. a. Focalization. The law 
of habit formation applied to the teaching of spelling requires 
first of all a clear image. See exactly, hear exactly, pronounce 
exactly, and write correctly each word to be mastered. For 
clear impression the assignment may require writing words 
plainly, syllabication, copying in the air and upon paper, 
pronouncing aloud individually and in concert. It is for more 
effective focalization that lessons have been shortened in 
recent years. The practice of writing one word at a time upon 
the board and the device of slit “finders” for sliding on the 
page to hide all but one word have the same purpose. The 
degree to which a given child or class may be visual, auditory, 
or motor minded we may not know, but the teacher who makes 
the multiple sense appeal is on safe ground. 
b. Repetition with attention. The second phase of the 
habit-formation law, attentive repetition, recognizes that 
spelling must be memorized. Probably most children learn 
little spelling while they read, since their attention is not 
upon spelling. Repetition without attention we all know to 
be idle, but all the amusing illustrations in the literature of 
method do not keep pupils and teachers from wasting their 
time in this monotonous activity. Short study periods and 
varied forms of drill reduce such waste to a minimum. Closely 
related to repeating without attention is repetition of the 
wrong form so often evident when pupils, either at the precept 
of a teacher or upon their own urge to be doing something 
tangible, write each word in the lesson ten times. Whether 
the incorrect form is due to a wrong image based upon faulty 
assignment, or is the result of copying a penmanship mistake 
as waning attention goes down the column, the consequence 
is the same. Repeating a wrong form fixes that form. : 
In common with all drill subjects, every element to be made
-P-A-G-E-51
  The Teaching of Spelling 43 
automatic must receive attentive repetition; the most difficult 
words or combinations need greatest attention; several short 
periods of repetition or drill are usually better than a single 
long one; and ultimate economy can be served only by sys- 
tematic and studied review of the most troublesome words at 
gradually increasing intervals. | 
c. Persistent correct practice. The third phase of the habit- 
formation law, permitting no exceptions, is perhaps most 
conspicuously violated. Surveys and common experience 
of all observing teachers show that words misspelled gen- 
erally in intermediate grades persist strongly as offenders 
in grammar grades and in high school. Attention to spelling 
is too much confined to the limits of formal lessons; the ex- 
cessive amount of written work required by many teachers 
makes inevitable a greatly increased number of mistakes, 
few of which are ever noted. Exceptions are being permitted 
until this ideal is adopted: “Every group doing written work 
is a spelling class.” 
3. Reasoning helps in spelling. While spelling depends upon 
a great deal of memorizing aided whenever possible by con- 
venient associations and mnemonic aids, the psychology of 
reasoning is largely utilized by all who learn intelligently. 
Though pupils are often led astray by their attempt to ration- 
alize the illogical instrument, English spelling, as in the case 
of the pupil who reasons heep because deep, or tractible be- 
cause contractible, such reasoning is more often right than 
wrong. One who is led to discover the reason for persisting e 
in singeing, tingeing, or hingeing is far more likely to be using 
economy than the child who mechanically masters each word, 
for he has a key to the situation even when he encounters a 
word he has never studied. In a similar way the pupil who 
reasons preach, peach, bleach, beach, reach, from teach may be 
misled in screech or speech, but he is a better prospect than 
one who never makes such associations or uses his reason in
-P-A-G-E-52
  44 The Technique of Teaching 
learning to spell. Most intelligent attention to the individual 
child and his spelling is necessary to determine when to suggest 
dependence upon rational spelling. As noted in the discussion 
of spelling rules, the value of such procedure is easily over- 
rated. 
4. Suggestion in teaching spelling. Spelling teachers need 
to know and practice the psychology of suggestion. The 
presence of an “easy” word in a list of those not spelled as 
they sound often causes the pupil to seek even a fantastic 
spelling, though no difficulty would have occurred if the word 
had been met in context or standing alone. Suggestion and 
imitation are so related as to be inseparable but they should 
be given due attention before many spelling rules are taught. 
In most cases, perhaps, such rules are as likely to suggest 
exceptions as to prove useful guides; unless they are thoroughly 
mastered and constantly used they tend to leave the pupil 
trying to recall “Final e preceded by a consonant (or was it 
a vowel?) is retained (or is it dropped?).” Rules which operate 
(or do not operate) in this way should not be too confidently 
inflicted. 
5. Spelling ideal or attitude. Though habit is the largest 
factor, no one ever reaches such a plane that all words auto- 
matically spell themselves. Because of this the spelling ideal 
must emerge: — “I dislike to think of myself as missing a 
word.” Spelling conscience makes one ashamed of mistakes; 
it cannot well develop when pupils daily write many words 
incorrectly. Short lessons absolutely mastered and_ brief 
written exercises one hundred per cent correct are a beginning 
of spelling conscience. Early formation of the dictionary 
habit promotes the same end, and intelligent discussion of 
correct spelling as a mode of necessary polite behavior re- 
inforces the growing ideal. The fact that one never becomes 
a correct speller by habit constitutes no excuse for misspelled 
words in a letter or other document.
-P-A-G-E-53
  
The Teaching of Spelling 45 
Pronunciation. 1. Psychological considerations. Imitation 
is the method of learning correct pronunciation; the psychology 
of habit formation functions just as in learning to spell. 
Without correct models proper pronunciation is never ac- 
quired; only by many repetitions are wrong pronouncing 
habits overcome. Nowhere is the specific nature of habit 
better shown. It is specific, individual words that are mis- 
pronounced. Yet there are often well-marked types of mis- 
takes. There is the lazy mouth type which seems to drag its 
syllables, the lisp, the tendency to make short 7 out of short 
eas in fince, the very common 60 for long u in tune, and in 
many communities numerous foreign inflections. 
Depending primarily upon habit psychology the teacher, 
in order to give direction, needs to be familiar with technical 
terms which pupils may sometime hear or may never hear. 
Vowel sounds, diphthongs and triphthongs, consonant sounds, 
labials, liquids, aspirates, digraphs and trigraphs, phono- 
grams, homographs, and homophones are part of spelling 
technique. It is now and then excellent economy to tell or 
show pupils how to place the vocal organs to make the sound 
required for proper pronunciation. 
2. Pronunciation devices. a. Syllabication. The principal 
devices for indicating pronunciation are syllabication, accents, 
and diacritical markings. The first is used in attacking new 
words as soon as pupils have made a beginning in phonics; 
it should soon come to be the mode of attack whenever an 
unfamiliar word is encountered. Many pupils seem unable 
to grasp long words; they hasten through them, omitting 
syllables, as in labratory or elfant. Only rigid insistence that 
they shall “slow down and divide into syllables” can correct 
this tendency. 
In connection with syllabication, use of the hyphen to 
separate syllables at the end of a line should be taught. It 
is doubtful whether rules are useful enough to spend time 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  46 The Technique of Teaching 
upon, but pupils should soon be made conscious that a vowel - 
sound is the basis of every syllable. Mental effort in deter- 
mining how to divide a word can often be eliminated by so 
spacing as to avoid the necessity of its division. Though 
this may seem to sanction an indolent ideal, it is the line of 
safety and economy as practiced by the best stenographers. 
b. Accent markings. The second pronunciation device, 
accent marking, is so simple that its use may begin early. 
Thorough drill upon well-known words of two syllables, and 
marking accents in long lists already familiar should precede 
application of accent in determining pronunciation of new 
words. Only after becoming acquainted with use of the accent 
tool can pupils employ it with new words. Concert pronun- 
ciation of accented lists from the blackboard is a device of 
proved efficiency in fixing the meaning of accent. 
c. Diacritical Markings. The third pronouncing device, dia- 
critical marking, is probably one that has been overworked. It 
consists essentially of learning an additional alphabet; if re- 
quired before spelling, reading, and writing habits are firmly 
fixed, it violates teaching principles by scattering instead of 
concentrating attention. It is difficult for one who has grown 
familiar with such markings to realizé the striking difference 
in appearance given to letters by their addition. Long and 
short vowels as a rule are most easily learned; these and a 
few others most commonly occurring should be mastered 
by most children in the fourth grade. 
One who has noticed the immense importance of imitation 
in pronunciation and the ease with which new words may be 
mastered by comparing them with words already known finds 
no difficulty in imagining a time when we shall no longer 
teach diacritical markings, but at present every teacher 
should be thoroughly acquainted with a complete key list. 
The gradual adoption of simplified spelling, now so evident, 
will in time reduce most words to a phonetic basis and obviate
-P-A-G-E-55
The Teaching of Spelling 47 
the necessity of other than alphabetic symbols. Though most 
of us prefer the old spellings, it seems far wiser for teachers 
to encourage the movement than to join the ranks of those 
who scoff at a progress they are powerless to prevent. The 
teacher who refuses to accept a pupil’s essay or composition 
because a few words are spelled correctly in the recognized 
“new” spelling should be sure of some rational justification 
of his attitude. It may also be noted that no great wisdom is 
needed to make jests at the expense of simplified spelling; 
magazine files indicate that no new jokes of this kind have 
been invented for many years. 
The meanings of words. A third phase, the meanings of 
words, is not so closely related to spelling as is pronunciation. 
Pupils can without difficulty spell Jong lists of words of which 
they have no comprehension. The old spelling book columns 
of captious, fractious, fictitious even represented a certain econ- 
omy of learning for those who carried the associations in 
mind permanently, remembering how a word ended because 
ofits presencein the list. Spelling is not primarily a vocabulary 
building exercise, but the best teaching takes account of mean- 
ings and seldom allows meaningless words to creep into lessons. 
1. Dictation and sentence making. Dictation exercises 
bring out meanings. Requiring pupils to use words in sensible 
sentences is an effective device provided such written work 
lis given proper attention, but time should not be wasted in 
aking sentences to illustrate the use of perfectly familiar 
ords. Pupils are able to use words quite intelligently in 
entences long before they can give definitions. In lower 
intermediate grades the meaning of words should be discussed; 
efinitions by illustration such as “patriot — Washington was 
patriot” or “inventor — Marconi is an inventor” follow. 
‘Patient means being quiet and not fussing” or “proper means 
ot the wrong thing” are not very accurate definitions, but 
eachers should not at first be too insistent upon exactness.

  48 The Technique of Teaching 
2. Teaching use of the dictionary. Use of the dictionary 
should be a lifelong habit. This it is most likely to become 
if pupils are taught to use it economically and effectively. 
Expecting pupils to acquire its use without instruction is 
unreasonable. Some learn, some become disgusted or fasten 
upon themselves habits of slow and cumbersome procedure 
which waste the time teachers should save. Dictionary in- 
struction is of as much importance in reading as in spelling, 
and the following suggestions may be used apart from either 
reading or spelling exercises. 
a. Every pupil must know his alphabet so well that he 
can use it readily. This would hardly seem to be a necessary 
precaution, but since the alphabet is not essential in learning 
to read, it is sometimes not learned at all. 
6. Have pupils arrange words in “dictionary order” con- 
sidering alphabetical sequence far enough into each word to 
determine its place, using lists of names or of spelling 
words. Variant devices may be employed, such as allow- 
ing each pupil to furnish ten or twenty words for the others 
to arrange, writing five or more words on slips to be arranged, 
pronouncing a few new words to be inserted in lists already 
arranged, and contests in quick placing of lists given by the 
teacher. 
c. Choose catchwords which occur at the top of dictionary 
pages. Write a pair of these on the blackboard and drill upon 
their use. Suppose, for example, that felis and fem are the 
catchwords. Pronounce a series of words like fell, feline, felt, 
felicity, and fend and have listed as occurring before, upon, or 
after this page. 
d. Assign a list of words asking pupils to discover the dic- 
tionary page upon which each is found. In conducting this 
exercise which may take the form of a contest only the number 
of the page upon which the word is found need be written, 
no attention being paid to the definition. In this way a
-P-A-G-E-57
  The Teaching of Spelling 49 
dictionary relay race may be conducted with a list of words 
on the blackboard; at signal start first pupils in each row to 
finding the first word. As soon as the first is found pupil 
records the number of the page and passes his dictionary to 
the next in the row who finds the next word making similar 
records. The row of pupils in which the dictionary moves 
fastest wins the race. 
e. Show how much, in addition to its definition, may be 
learned about a word — its proper, preferred, or variant spell- 
ings, its pronunciations, syllabication, derivation, synonyms, 
inflected forms, and often its usage in a model sentence or 
quotation. Before these can be learned economically, pupils 
must know the abbreviations commonly used in the dictionary 
itself. 
f. In using any but the smallest dictionary, pupils must 
learn to select, often from many definitions, the one that 
applies. The dictionary consulting pupil who, being asked 
to use the word ferment in a sentence, wrote, “I would rather go 
hunting this afternoon than to ferment here at school,” had 
at least partial justificacion from the lexicon, as one of the 
definitions given for ferment is “to work spontaneously.” 
“We must use the mortar; that ship cannot live in such a 
sea,” said the captain of the life-saving crew. What does 
mortar mean in this sentence? One definition has to do with 
a vessel in which substances are pulverized as at a pharmacy; 
the second is related to mining; a “night light” and a “cap in 
the shape of a mortar” follow but are no more applicable. 
The fifth, “a cannon used to throw a life line,” is the definition 
sought. Specific exercises in selecting the right one of several 
definitions will save time and prevent the discouragement 
felt by many pupils who wrestle with the dictionary only to 
find that the definition selected with somuch toil “will not work.” 
g. The introduction and the appendix of most dictionaries 
contain much to which pupils’ attention should be called in
-P-A-G-E-58
  50 The Technique of Teaching 
well-planned dictionary lessons. Rules cf spelling, proper 
names, foreign words and phrases, abbreviations, and illus- 
trations of many technical matters are among the things 
which should not remain locked up and unused when needed. 
3. Word study, word building, and word analysis are econom- 
ical in learning meanings. Some pupils are as much interested 
in a word story as in a manual training project or a scientific 
experiment. Before children leave the grades they should 
know the meaning and use of prefix, suffix, root word, deriva- 
tive, and many of the affixes in the accompanying list, all 
of which every teacher of spelling should be familiar with. 
An interesting and profitable exercise for upper intermediate 
and grammar grades is to assign lists of root words or Latin 
roots upon which pupils may build derivations; e. g., duc 
or duct, flex or flect, mit or miss, and gress. If a contest is 
made of such exercises extraordinary caution must be used 
to prevent misunderstandings. Roots must be discreetly 
selected; whether singulars and plurals shall both count and 
other controvertible points must be settled.

Selection of spelling vocabulary. The number of words 
actually needed in spelling our wants is comparatively small. 
Three or four thousand will usually suffice for what might 
Ibe termed our common spelling vocabulary. Instead of a 
traditional list selected upon the basis of individual preference, 
Imost schools and textbooks now seek to find the words actually 
needed and liable to be misspelled. The best known list was 
elected from some thousands of letters, choosing only words 
requently used. Some school systems choose their spelling 
ists from collections of words actually misspelled by pupils 
in. their written work. When the necessary and troublesome 
ords have been discovered the spelling problem consists 
f emphasis and expert teaching of a comparatively small list. 
If commonly used words are properly mastered and spelling
-P-A-G-E-60
  52 The Technique of Teaching 
attitude and ideal are right, the small specialized vocational 
vocabulary most of us need may be left to itself. Relatively 
little time need be taken for rural or urban differentiation and 
local vocabulary. It will probably puzzle the reader to name 
a hundred words seriously needed by most persons in his 
community not equally necessary in nearly every part of 
the United States. This indicates that a local list should be 
selected with great care and then as thoroughly taught as 
the general list prescribed by a state course of study or in 
an adopted textbook. 
Textbooks in teaching spelling. 1. Arguments for and 
against use of spelling text. a. “Correlation versus isolation.” 
It has been argued that any spelling textbook must present 
words in formal and unrelated ways, with little regard to | 
use or function. It has been assumed that pupils will learn 
spelling more joyfully and effectively if it is motivated by 
the fact that words are needed now rather than in an uncertain 
future. Neither experimental evidence nor ordinary observa- 
tion is conclusive upon this point. The fact that a pupil is 
about to use a word has no great effect upon his ambition 
to master its spelling; he can copy it just as well without learn- 
ing how to spell it. Learning to spell a word is usually quite 
unrelated to its use in a composition, it takes the same kind 
and amount of study whether in an isolated list or a group 
of words about to be used in a content lesson. 
b. Selection argument. Spelling textbooks not infrequently 
contain rare and little used words. For this reason it has been 
argued that spelling lists should be made by teachers from 
words needed or misspelled by pupils. Following this ideal 
a number of school systems abolished spelling books sixty 
years ago but in every case restored them after a few years. 
The tendency to do away with the spelling book has mani- 
fested itself more recently in connection with educational 
measurement and scientific curriculum studies,
-P-A-G-E-61
The Teaching of Spelling 53 
At present the theoretical gains of eliminating the spelling 
book seem to be outweighed by practical disadvantages. 
Incidental spelling easily tends to become accidental; spelling 
can be learned only by studying spelling. Teachers find 
that making their own textbooks takes too much time; their 
vigilance in correcting written work relaxes; and even if zeal 
for the bookless plan continues it has been found that spelling 
lists selected by teachers contain many words which are local 
and personal, rather than generally worth while — and thus 
are open to the objections hurled against the old-fashioned 
spelling book. If the adopted list is the result of a well con- 
ducted scientific survey of local needs, it is found to include 
about the same vocabulary as is contained in a modern 
speller, since textbook makers have been quick to profit by 
such investigations. Further, a sufficient amount of drill 
and review is not easily insured except by means of a text- 
book. The spelling book is an economical and effective teaching 
device but it needs intelligent use, and no teacher should 
confine work to even the best textbook. 
2. The modern spelling book. The modern spelling book 
contains from 3000. to 6000 words, for the most part well 
chosen in accordance with the principles of scientific cur- 
riculum making. Most books in common use provide arrange- 
ment of words

3. Use of spelling books. Lessons should be short; the lesso1 
numbers, first month’s work, and similar divisions sometime 
found in textbooks are usually no guide for a day’s or month’ 
work. 
Eliminate in the assignment all words every member o 
the class knows how to spell. Blind repetitious study of familia 
words is a wasteful case of overlearning. 
Teach each pupil to eliminate from his own task word 
which he already spells correctly, and to concentrate upo1 
the rest. 
Inspire spelling conscience so that each pupil will mak 
an individual spelling book containing words which he ha 
misspelled. 
Utilize the “black list” — troublesome words which by com 
mon consent it is inexcusable to misspell. In any such lis 
the “One Hundred Spelling Demons of the English Language” 
will be well represented. These should be agreed upon a 
charter members of the black list. 
The presence of a word even in the most carefully devisec 
textbook does not prove it to be worth teaching. However 
reasons should be at hand for declaring a word unsuitable 
Authors of spelling textbooks are at least as competent a 
individual teachers to decide. 
Diagnosis of spelling difficulties. 1. Causes of errors. Analy 
sis of mistakes is necessary if pupils are to be helped intelli 
gently. Merely saying, “You are careless,” or “Spell better 
has no value. Skilled technique of teaching must discove 
specific “whys.” General causes of misspelling include th 
following, suggested as the beginning of diagnostic analysis 
and others which alert study will reveal to every teacher wh: 
collects spelling mistakes of pupils. 
a. Incorrect or slovenly pronunciation. 
b. Inconsistency of English spelling. In some cases afte

-P-A-G-E-63
  The Teaching of Spelling 55 
the pupil has learned to reason fairly well from sound analogies, 
“It ought to be because ——-———— having the 
same sound is spelled that way,” he finds that his reasoning 
will not work. We have taught him to be more or less reason- 
able and then have to inform him that spelling often seems to 
be an erratic subject, imposing irrational burdens sometimes 
without being obliged to give any account of itself. To all 
practical intent no reason can be given for some spellings 
except that they are. 
c. Imitation—showing itself in attempting to spell words 
as they are pronounced, either correctly or incorrectly (a 
and b above); sometimes in the copying of incorrect forms 
from the work of other pupils or even teachers. 
d. Carelessness—This commonly alleged reason for wrong 
spelling needs further analysis as it has an indefinite meaning. 
The following are often set down to the account of care- 
lessness: 
(1) Peculiar penmanship ‘n which certain letters are formed 
so that they are wrongly interpreted; undotted 7’s, uncrossed 
t’s when made very short, a’s made like e are examples occur- 
ring commonly enough. Very unusual cases are found now 
and then, as that of the pupil who uniformly failed to loop the 
letter y leaving it like wu. 
(2) Haste in writing -—students who must write lecture 
notes are likely to develop an abbreviated language which 
may persist when haste is no longer an excuse. Leaving 
off final letters is an example. 
(3) Writing the sound of following words often brings 
results which seem like most capricious carelessness; thought 
is ahead of the pen. “Heaght and light” is an example. 
e. Lack of spelling ideal. Some pupils, poor spellers from 
the first, have never appreciated the situation of writing a 
lpage perfectly spelled. They expect red ink spelling correc- 
ions. They need inspiration of the confidence which would

  56 The Technique of Teaching 
come with a one hundred per cent performance in what 
seems an impossible field. 
2. Types of errors. a. Due to pronunciation and enun- 
ciation. 
(1) Mispronunciation; e. g., asparagrass, realating, intirely, 
grievious, mischievious, probalem. Diagnosis suggests the 
remedy—drill upon correct pronunciation. 
(2) Enunciation by which a syllable or sound is elided; 
e.g., corpal, orent, quanity, lititure, physology, temperment, 
temperture, restation, venelating, cigrett, futher, varities, scenry, 
lenth. Diagnosis suggests drill upon proper enunciation 
usually accompanied by syllabication. 
(3) Obscure vowel sound indicated by wrong vowel; 
e. g., preperation, benifit, excellant, colering, grammer, seperate, 
originized, curiosoty, competetive, fundamentels, definate, in- 
clanation, Wisconson. This is a most difficult type of mistake 
te remedy. Obscure pronunciation is correct in most such 
cases. Drill exaggerating the sound of the correct form, as 
grammar or Wisconsin, helps with some of these without 
danger of affected pronunciation. With older pupils definite 
may be shown to be de-finite, inclination, inclination. One’s 
ingenuity is taxed to find appropriate remedies, and for some 
mistakes of this type only the brute act of memorizing avails. 
b. Wrong letters or combinations carried over by analogy 
or habit. 
(1) Final e retained; e. g., civilizeation, writeing, judgement, 
develope, systeme, graspe. Diagnosis suggests application of 
a well-known spelling rule to the first three of these; the sug- 
gestion that a final vowel usually lengthens the principal 
vowei in its syllable should be of value with the last three. 
(2) Familiar word correctly spelled and wrongly carried| 
over into a derivative or what seems to be a derivative; e. g., 
scowlding, fourty, grainary, schoolastic, pronounciation, Glass 
gow. Diagnosis suggests for some of these stress upon correc! 
     
   
                    
   
     
    
-P-A-G-E-65
  
The Teaching of Spelling 57 
pronunciation; for others individual circumstances must 
determine procedure. 
(3) Phonetic analogies — representing sounds incorrectly 
by letters or combinations which indicate the same sounds 
correctly in other words; e.g., wheather, neetness, groop, 
preceeds, reguard, waunt, knotice, looze, speach, thay, lome, 
knolege, goard, achre. Diagnosis suggests teaching together 
words of the same combinations, thus taking advantage of 
whatever the law of contiguity in association can contribute 
to overcome our illogically contrived orthography. 
(4) Wrong prefixes or suffixes; e. g., preformed, pretain, 
prehaps, perpare, familar, captian, barbarious, similiar, 
respectively (for respectfully). Diagnosis suggests drill upon 
pronunciation with syllabication. 
(5) Wrong doubling, usually at the end of syllables; e. g., 
ammount, oppinion, proffessional, expell, compell, habbit, 
untill, definite, parrottes. Diagnosis suggests primarily syllab- 
ication which will in some cases show the redundant letter; 
others may be grouped phonetically as expel, rebel, compel, dispel. 
(6) Failure to double, usually at the end of syllables; e. g., 
oraly, geting, puting, parot, hoter, omited, permiting, inflamable, 
beginer. Diagnosis indicates application of a common spelling 
rule and attention to very exact pronunciation which in many 
of these words reveals without affectation the omitted letter. 
c. Attraction and inversion due to “strong” letters; e. g., 
conquor, colloct, eaisly, lepoard, oponion, worng. Diagnosis 
shows that most of these are writing mistakes; pupils writing 
these incorrectly often give the right spelling orally. When 
the word has really been wrongly imaged syllabication and 
pronunciation drills are indicated. 
d. Abbreviations and contractions, ect. being the worst of- 
fender. Explanation of the derivation of this and similar 
shortened forms is the spelling remedy; a more fundamental 
jmprovement usually would be to avoid their use,
-P-A-G-E-66
  58 The Technique of Teaching 
e. Wrong compounds and hyphenates; e. g., alright, maby, 
where ever, some times, someone, hafto. Some of these are not 
strictly spelling mistakes; the most generally applicable 
treatment is to show clearly the original words which have 
been compounded, many of them first used in a hurried pronun- 
ciation. For use of the hyphen which is always tending to 
disappear from frequently used words, pupils should be directed 
to dictionary authority. 
f. Use of wrong word; e. g., principle-principal, to-too-two, 
son-sun, rap-wrap, current-currant, course-coarse, sent-scent- 
cent, right-write-rite-wright. Strictly speaking, these may not 
be mistakes in spelling but rather in language. Dictation 
spelling represents the greatest economy in eliminating such 
errors. Individual confusion may sometimes be cleared by 
dictating such amusing sentences as, “The train waits here too 
from two-to-two to two-two,” or by saying, “I shall dictate 
slowly and plainly two sentences, one of which you cannot 
write even though you understand it perfectly and know how 
to spell all the words. ‘You are too late to catch the train. 
There are two (to’s, too’s, two’s) in this sentence.’” 
Spelling rules. Spelling rules should be few, true, clearly 
and accurately stated, and easy of application. They should 
be taught after discussion inductively as they are not likely 
to be applied unless they are a summary of directed observa- 
tions. The following are of value to most children; unlike 
other spelling rules they are not too cumbrous, difficult of 
comprehension, nor fraught with so many exceptions as to 
be useless or unlikely to be remembered when needed. 
I. “I before e Teach after presenting lists of words to 
Except after ¢ which rule applies 
Or when sounded as a te et 
As in neighbor and weigh” believe deceive 
niece receive 
reprieve perceive 
relieve conceit
-P-A-G-E-67
The Teaching of Spelling 59 
Note exceptions: weir, weird, sheik, seize, leisure, height, sleight, gneiss, 
surfeit, forfeit. 
2. Final single silent ¢ is usually dropped before a suffix beginning with a 
vowel; e. g., 
recite recitation 
sense sensible 
cure curable 
escape escapade 
erase erasing 
Note exceptions, especially after cand g, where pronunciation might bein 
doubt if the e were not retained. 
peace peaceable hoe hoeing 
manage manageable dye dyeing 
singe singeing mile mileage 
3. Final silent ¢ is retained before a suffix beginning with a consonant; 
e& gy 
move movement hate 
polite —_ politeness trouble 
4. Monosyllables and words accented on the last syllable, ending ina 
single consonant preceded by a single vowel, double the final consonant when 
a termination beginning with a vowel is added; e. g., hateful mere merely 
troublesome 
swim swimming exceptions 
whiz whizzing fix fixing 
permit permitting flax flaxen 
expel expelling confer conference 
Lesson technique. 1. Assignment. a. Spelling assign- 
ments should contain from two to six new words. If longer 
lists are given the new words should be designated. “Clear, 
definite, and specific” as applied to spelling assignments mean 
that, if words are to be syllabicated, defined, or used in sen- 
tences, these or similar requirements must be stated so that 
no one can misunderstand. 
b. The blackboard, pronouncing aloud, and repeating in 
concert should assure visual and auditory images of new 
words. 
c. Probable difficulties should be anticipated. An experi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  60 The Technique of Teaching 
enced teacher usually knows which words will be misspelled 
and the form that errors will take. To avoid suggesting mis- 
takes which might otherwise never be made, a safe rule is to 
forecast nothing incorrect unless very sure the warning is 
needed. 
d. Similarities between words may often be noted in order 
to aid pupils in associating the new with others better known; 
complement may be associated with complete; gentleman is 
gentle man, grammar has the same vowel in each syllable, 
January but February, Arc tic giving rhythmic stress to 
the last letter of each syllable, southern is south ern, drown 
rhymes with down, knowledge comes from know, preference 
is prefer ence; such are examples of assisting suggestions which 
alertness will discover in many lessons. A great proportion 
of pupils are helped by noting the “swing” or rhythm of longer 
words; unless exaggerated rhythmic accent is likely to fix 
an incorrect pronunciation it is a safe expedient. 
e. Study directions snould be provided. For pupils who 
easily lapse in study effort a series of written directions to 
be followed is effective. Several of these as follow may be 
used: 
(1) Pronounce each word; pronounce by syllables. 
(2) Write words, separating into syllables. 
(3) Use each word in a sentence. 
(4) Write a story using all words of the lesson. 
(5) Spell words with letter cards (lower grades). 
(6) Underline all common phonograms. 
(7) Place accents. 
Study series like the following may also be used: 
(1) Rank the words of the lesson, at least placing hardest words first and 
easiest last. 
(2) Spell all words silently four times. 
(3) What spelling rule applies to the spelling of   
 
-P-A-G-E-69
The Teaching of Spelling 61 
(4) List the words in two groups. 
(a) Those spelled as they sound. 
(b) Those not spelled as they sound. 
(5) , Underline separately the parts of any compound words. 
(6) Be sure you are pronouncing correctly. 
(7) Close the eyes and recall how the word looked. 
(8) Open eyes and compare image with word in book. 
(9) Pronounce by syllables. 
(10) Spell five times with eyes closed. 
(11) Write word without looking at book. 
(12) Compare it with the original. 
(13) Write word three times. 
It may be noted that spelling is often one of the best home 
study subjects, for parents can really be of great help. 
f. The assignment furnishes motive— inspires perform- 
ance. Immediate interest in spelling as such is rare. Spelling 
to keep up individual or class records, win head marks, make 
high grades, win success in a contest, or exemption from the 
spelling class are legitimate motives even though they are 
distinctly school ends. The functional demand that pupils 
shall spell correctly in order to be understood is fundamental, 
of course, but is, like the others, a school motive; the teacher 
could understand the written work even though it contain 
many misspelled words, but she will not because it is part of 
the pupils’ business in school to learn to spell correctly. A 
positive, forceful, encouraging manner, vigorous poise, and 
expression are likely to result in the felt need for spelling, 
regardless of any immediate life purpose to which it may be put. 
2. Class exercises in spelling. a. The secret of a vitalized 
class period in spelling is often a matter of voice, \inflection, 
or manner. Words should be pronounced plainly — once. 
If room conditions are right, words not given too fast, and 
pupils know what is expected, “What’s the word?” will not be 
heard. Such vain repetitions as, “The next word is ” 
or “Next word ” are elements of monotony or dis-
-P-A-G-E-70
  62 The Technique of Teaching 
order contributed by the teachers. If spelling is oral each 
should have one deliberate trial without any kind of prompting, 
even by unconscious nod or facial expression, of teacher or 
classmate. Variations in mode of conducting the class are 
essential. Pupils should occasionally take charge, pronounce 
words, select lessons, correct papers. 
b. “Oral versus written” spelling misrepresents the situation; 
bothareessential. Forwrittenspelling, the followingmay besaid: 
(1) It places spelling in the form universally employed in 
life outside the school. 
(2) It renders dictation spelling practicable. 
(3) It represents economy of time in a crowded program. 
Pronouncing may be done for two classes at once; papers 
may be corrected outside of school hours. 
(4) Each pupil writes every word; the inattentive may or 
may not hear words spelled orally. 
c. Oral spelling as a device presents numerous advantages. 
(1) It seems less monastic than written work of which 
the school usually has too much; it admits of many variations 
of procedure to stimulate interest. 
(2) It means economy since no papers need correction. 
(3) Correct pronunciation is insured if each is required 
to pronounce clearly before spelling. 
(4) Syllabication is easily emphasized; requiring beginners 
to divide written words into syllables is likely to result in 
penmanship “breaks.” 
The values of oral spelling may in large measures be realized 
in written work if pupils are asked to spell aloud in rotation 
while others of the class mark misspelled words. Because 
of inner speech, listening pupils spell all words in oral spelling 
rather than merely those which fall to them “by turn”; in the 
same way they usually pronounce to themselves as they write, 
thus imaging the sound of each word. Written spelling with 
oral reviews is preferable to exclusive use of either form.

d. Since the success of spelling drills depends so largely 
upon giving variety to class work, a group of devices is sug- 
gested. Not all are suited to any grade; nothing but loss of 
time and failure will result if the wrong plan is attempted; 
what may be very much worth while in grade seven may be 
impossible in the third grade. It is, of course, evident that the 
finest device will lose its fascination if used too constantly, or 
if used without adaptation to needs of the individual pupil 
or school. 
GaMEs AND DEVICES 
I. Making a dictionary. Each pupil makes a booklet containing twenty- 
six pages, one for each letter of the alphabet. Whenever a pupil misses a 
word or finds it especially troublesome he places it upon the proper page 
in his dictionary. It thus becomes an object of special study. This is also 
good primary training for learning the use of the dictionary. (Second or 
third grade.) 
2. Of what word am I thinking? A number of words are written on the 
blackboard—make, bake, cake, rake. A pupil goes forward, selects a word, 
turns his back to the board and asks, “Of what word am I thinking?” The 
pupils in turn ask “Is it m-a-k-e?” spelling the word but not pronouncing it. 
Until the word is guessed the child at the board replies “No, it is not make, — 
m-a-k-e,” pronouncing the word and then spelling it. The game is con- 
tinued until the right word is guessed when the child who is “it” spells the 
word, saying, “Yes, it is ,»” and takes his seat, the one who guessed 
successfully taking his place at the board. (Second grade.) 
3. Living letters. This game requires a permanent equipment of twenty- 
six pieces of cardboard about eight inches square, each containing a letter 
of the alphabet. The cards may be provided with cords so that they may be 
hung upon the children. If there are fewer than twenty-six pupils only the 
vowels and more commonly used consonants may be employed. A pupil spells 
a word distinctly without pronouncing it; the living letters named form the 
word and face the class. Pupils singly or in concert pronounce the word as 
soon as it is recognized, or each in turn may whisper it tothe teacher. As a 
variant device the living letters may be called out of the order required 
in spelling the word and the class required to arrange them. (First and 
second grades.) 
4. Making words. Each child is supplied with several sets of vowels and 
the more commonly used consonants, no letter lacking entirely. A selected  
-P-A-G-E-72
    
64 The Technique of Teaching 
pupil names the letters of a word in irregular order, the other children find- 
ing the letters as named. The game consists in arranging the letters to form 
the word. Words correctly arranged within the time limit are allowed to 
remain and are counted in the final score. The pupil who arranges a word 
first calls the letters of the next word which he himself may select. The one 
having on his di sk the greatest number of correctly spelled words wins the 
game. (First three grades.) 
5. Word family contests. a. Find and underline all the -eat, -an, -old, 
-and, -ent phonograms in these words. (Write on blackboard a list of words 
containing many of these phonograms.) Then copy these words in families; 
e. g., the 
-eat family 
meat | 
neat 
seat 
b. (After choosing sides.) Make all the words you can in word families, 
using these phonograms — -ate, -ink, -ell, mi-, so-, sa-. Arrange the words 
in this way: 
-ate mi- 
f-ate mile 
m- mine 
r- mice 
sk- might 
The winning side may be the one having the greatest number of correctly 
spelled words or the greatest vocabulary, counting each word once. (First 
and second grades.) 
6. Card device, In addition to the black list idea which is used to develop 
“spelling conscience,” pupils are often encouraged to make a card for each 
troublesome word, indicating the difficulty by a peculiarly formed letter or 
a letter in color. |   sepArate 
   It should be noted in this, as in all such devices, that making the card is 
not studying spelling. 
7. Spelling m the alphabet. Place letters of the alphabet upon small 
cards, face downward, allowing each pupil to draw one. All take their places, 
standing according to alphabetical order. Proceeding down the line each 
spells, 7 and defines or uses in a sentence a word beginning with

his letter. To be ready for this exercise pupils must have looked up at least 
twenty-five words. Pride in the mastery of a new word is a strong motive. 
If the class is small each may draw several cards, 
8. One Hundred Spelling Demons of the English Language. This famous 
list contains many of the words misspelled by pupils in all grades. These 
might well be used as lessons beginning with the fourth grade; gradually 
reduce the list by eliminating words no pupil writes incorrectly, correspond- 
ingly increasing emphasis upon others until the list is mastered. Repeat 
the list at intervals to make sure that there has been no relapse.

Spelling matches. Spelling matches or contests are con- 
ducted in more ways than some may have discovered. Some 
of those here described are of interest for but a day; others 
may be used repeatedly without losing their appeal. A few 
are more likely to develop vocabulary or word facility than 
spelling itself, and in some, the play element is so strong as 
to suggest an intellectual game for rainy day recess rather 
than a serious device for teaching spelling.

66 The Technique of Teaching 
In all strictly spelling contests it is well to omit names of 
persons which admit of variation; e. g., May, Mae; all con- 
tractions involving use of the apostrophe, abbreviations, 
compound words in which practice with regard to the hyphen 
may not be uniform, and in oral contests to ignorecapitalization. 
The last may be most conveniently managed by agreeing before- 
hand that no proper nouns of any kind will be pronounced. 
SomE Forms oF SPELLING CONTESTS 
r. After “choosing sides,” pronounce words alternately to each group un- 
til all contestants of one side have missed; the other side wins the match. 
2. Choose spellers as in the preceding. If a word is misspelled on side 
A, the one on side B who spells it correctly captures him. The captain or 
“trapper” may be designated to make all captures, each word misspelled 
being referred to the captain of the opposing side. Should the captain him- 
self be captured the one first chosen takes his place or another may be 
elected. 
3. Sides chosen as in the preceding. Since best spellers who least need 
practice remain on the floor longest in the typical spelling contest, and those 
spelled down usually waste most of the time after taking their seats, have 
all stand in line spelling in turn the entire period announced for the match. 
Ascore keeper records the score of each pupil and side as follows: 
Side A Side B 
Mary Joseph 111 
Henry 1 Ben 
Mendel 1111 Rita 1 
June 11 Elnora 11111 
The number of words misspelled at the close of the period determines 
the losing side; or the number of pupils who spelled all words correctly 
may determine. The latter plan more nearly resembles the usual procedure 
since a single mistake eliminates the individual. 
4. Sides chosen. Pronounce for written spelling a large number of review 
words. The side which has the smallest total number of misspelled words is 
the winner. In this plan all pupils spell every word. 
5. Sides chosen. The first pupil on side A spells any| word. The corre- 
sponding pupil on side B must within a given time—ten seconds perhaps— 
spell correctly a word beginning with the last letter in the word just 
spelled. Words ending in x may beruled out, or provision may be made to
-P-A-G-E-75
The Teaching of Spelling 67 
extend the time of any pupil who inadvertently spells a word terminating in 
this letter. 
6. Place five or ten words on the board, asking all pupils to writeas many 
derivatives as possible in five minutes. The side having the greatest total, 
counting each word but once, wins the contest. Papers should be exchanged 
promptly at the end of five minutes. Misspelled words do not count. Illus- 
tration: 
secure—insecure, security, insecurity, secured, securing 
associate—associated, association, associating 
pronounce—mispronounce, pronounced, pronouncing, pronounceable 
7. Ata given signal expose five or ten word roots from which words may 
be formed by addition of prefixes or suffixes. Close the contest sharply at 
expiration of time agreed upon. The side writing correctly the greatest 
number of words wins the match. To avoid confusion, a wise precaution is 
to write all the variant forms of a root in the list exposed; as, 
cap, cep, cip, capt, cept; vid, vis; vert, vers; pel, pell, puls 
8. Place a word of some length upon the board, asking pupils to make as 
many words as possible from the letters it contains, using no letter oftener 
than it appears in the original. Exclude -proper names and contractions; 
for misspelled words, either give no rating or attach a penalty. If time is 
limited count no words of less than four letters. At the end of the appointed 
period exchange papers or select tellers to count the score. The side hav- 
ing the greatest number of words wins. 
g. When a spelling list is to be reviewed ask each pupil to jumble the 
letters of five or ten words and exchange papers with his rival of the oppos- 
ing side, who from the letters writes the words. The side which first writes 
all correctly wins the match. A half minute penalty may be imposed for 
each word incorrectly written, each of which does not use all the letters or 
uses letters not on the list. A similar penalty may be imposed for each list 
of jumbled letters incorrectly made from the original words. A sample 
jumbled list and the correct spelling as it might appear after the words 
were written is given herewith. As a check pupils should count letters.

ro, The pupils of a junior high school conducted their own systematic 
review of spelling which ended in a grand contest according to the following 
schedule posted before the contest began. All except the first two lists were

collected by pupils and the final list was made up after class discussion as to 
the importance of each word included.

March 15—Names of fifty largest American cities. 
March 22—Names of European countries and cities. | 
March 29—State and national offices. 
April 5—Occupations. 
April 12—Fruits and vegetables. 
April 19—Spelling match—Boys vs. Girls. 
rz. After choosing sides each division sends three (or five) representa- 
tives to the blackboard. Five or ten words are pronounced by the conductor 
of the match, a pupil perhaps, those at the blackboard writing them. The 
class then corrects the lists; a score keeper at the board posts the record, 
writes correctly all words misspelled and the initials of the pupil who wrote 
incorrectly. Representatives may be changed after each list or the same 
group may serve for the day. The blackboard score should show for each 
pupil the number of words spelled correctly and the total score of each side.

METHOD PROBLEMS 
1. Since pupils ultimately use spelling only in written form, compare the 
economy of learning to spell from script with that of the usual study of 
printed words. 
2. When in doubt about the spelling of a word some perscns spell it 
aloud in order to determine whether “it sounds right.” Others write the 
doubtful word to see how it looks. Many use both plans with some words, 
Explain the psychological factors involved in such cases,
-P-A-G-E-77
  
The Teaching of Spelling 69 
3. Make a key for teaching essential diacritical markings. In selecting key 
words remember that they should be short, typical, involve no confusing 
elements, and should when possible be easily recalled by association. Thus 
in illustrating the sound of broad a, all, haul, or altogether may be used; 
the presence of the second vowel in haul and “the unnecessary length” of 
altogether make the first word, all, the better key word. Move, route, or 
reproval might be employed to illustrate the double -o (9) sound of 0; the 
first word is the best. 
4. Three views have been held with regard to teaching homophones or 
homonyms: 
a, They should be taught in pairs as doublets. 
b. They should be taught separately. 
c. They should be taught separately in the lower grades and together 
comparatively in the higher grades. 
Of the three plans which do you prefer? Upon what evidence does your 
preference rest? 
5. The meaning of words may be acquired by means of sense objects, 
through action, by repeated use, in context, by direct telling or explanation, 
or by resort to the dictionary. Give illustrative examples of words or situa- 
tions in which each of these might be the best plan. 
6. One of the rules of a public spelling contest required the conductor to 
follow the pronunciation indicated in the textbook used. This book pro- 
nounced c-a-I-f calf although no one within many miles ever spoke the word 
in that way and few recognized it at all. What should be done in such a 
case? To what extent should a teacher help pupils to spell by varying pro- 
nunciation or pronouncing incorrectly? 
7. Old-fashioned oral spelling laid great stress upon syllabication. A-d, 
ad, v-a-n, van - advan; t-a, ta- advanta-g-e-o-u-s, geous- advantageous, 
was the usual plan which in some communities took the form, “A-d, ad, 
and there’s the ad; v-a-n van, and there’s the van; t-a, ta, and there’s the 
advanta; g-e-o-u-s, geous, and there’s your advantageous.” It is not diffi- 
cult to understand why this method has been discontinued, though it em- 
phasized syllabication. How do you secure necessary repetition in syllable 
discrimination? 
8. Illustrate the use of three rules in the teaching of spelling. Explain 
how such rules may be taught inductively and write a plan for teaching one 
lof them in this way. 
9. What is the effect upon a pupil of studying words the spelling of which 
is quite familiar and causes no trouble? To what extent would a pupil be 
warranted in assuming that because a word is assigned for study there must

  70 The Technique of Teaching 
be some peculiarity about it which could cause him to misspell it? Describe 
class procedure which is designed to eliminate the waste of overstudy in 
spelling. 
10. In beginning classes should “regular” words be presented until the 
pupil has developed sound analogies thoroughly or should some irregular 
words be taught from the start? In answering this question note the fact 
that most words are spelled more or less regularly according to sound; con- 
sider also the “inertia of habit” as the cause of such mistakes as noe, ail- 
mighty, heep, bie. 
11. To what extent does learning to spell a word in isolation as part of a 
column or list insure its correct spelling in composition? What are the merits 
and defects of dictation spelling? Is a pupil more or less likely to misspell 
a word when he is primarily interested in spelling as column lessons? 
12. It has been said that pupils study more willingly and learn more 
economically if they have an immediate use for the words studied and many 
devices are based upon this assumption. What evidence may be cited to 
prove 
a, greater willingness than in preparation of lessons based upon the usual 
school incentives of emulation, keeping up a record, or making good grades? 
6. economy of effort because of closer attention? 
c, that words learned for an immediate use are more or less thoroughly 
learned than by means of the ordinary spelling drill? 
13. One reason for the difficulty of English spelling is the great number of 
borrowed words the language contains. Foreign words which have not been 
fully incorporated into our speech are frequently written in italics to show 
that the writer is conscious that he is borrowing. Make a list of ten words 
borrowed in recent years. How would you prove that such borrowing is 
worth while in spite of the additional difficulty in orthography? 
14. A pupil asked, “What is the use of silent letters?” The teacher re- 
plied, “They are worse than useless; they do nothing but make spelling 
hard.” Admitting that their presence increases the perplexities of the 
spelling problem, show by example their value in ten familiar words. In 
which of the following do silent letters serve a useful purpose? 
singe often use knit 
fate psalm should glue 
through scissors write touch 
mnemonic gorge gnat 
15. State the arguments for and against the teaching of simplified spell- 
ing in the case of such words as 
a. catalog (catalogue), prolog (prologue).
-P-A-G-E-79

b. Profest (professed), digrest (digressed). 
c. det (debt), hed (head), tel (tell). 
Which of these spellings are used in reputable periodicals of general 
circulation? 
16. Many teachers, who have never found spelling an obstacle, experi- 
ence difficulty in understanding or sympathizing with pupils who seldom 
master a spelling lesson. As a bit of experience to aid in finding how some of 
these pupils feel day after day, have the following list of not very unusual 
words pronounced to a teacher or group of persons who are considered good 
in spelling. After those thus tested are through protesting that the spelling 
given here is incorrect or that “there are two ways equally good” and have 
settled all doubts by appeal to the dictionary, the remaining mental atti- 
tude is probably faintly indicative of what some pupils experience every 
day.

17. Mnemonic devices and tricks of association sometimes fix the 
spelling of troublesome words. Notice the following and add to the list. 
a, Grammar would be the same if the first letter were taken off and 
placed last; or grammar has the same vowel in each syllable. 
b. Berkeley—use all the e’s possible. 
c. The order of ie and ei combination is indicated in Alice—é follows 1, 
e follows c. 
d, Ghin right is wrong; w in wrong is not right; gh in ought ought not 
to be there. 
18. a. “The college at Comelnra is the finest in Katorsac; all who attend 
learn phlebotomy though this is seldom practiced and Novalis thinks the 
fart will vanish from all the Umraniad.” Have a person read this without 
saying anything about spelling; then find out how many of the unusual 
ords are remembered as to spelling. 
b. The name Roosevelt was given in a spelling list to a class of college 
tudents who had encountered the name hundreds of times in their reading. 
ven spellings of the name were represented in a class of thirty. 
Upon the evidence of a. and 6. and other observations you have made, 
o what extent do we learn to spell while reading?

correct pronunciation engaged in animated conversation said: “I laughed 
and laughed until I couldn’t laff any more.” 
6. A pupil required to write chimney ten times before joining his play- 
mates wrote the word seven times correctly and finished off according to his 
usual pronunciation chimley. When asked about his mistake he explained, 
“I got in a hurry and forgot.” 
Explain the psychology of a. and b. 
20. “Write the contractions in the list five times each,” said the teacher. 
Many of the pupils wrote for I’m five I's, five apostrophes, and five m’s in 
columns. What principles of economical learning does such written “study” 
violate? 
21. Give reasons, upon pedagogical grounds, for approval or disapproval 
of the following procedures in teaching spelling: 
a, Mimeographed lists of words are given to pupils with directions like, 
“There are three misspelled words among these; find them.” 
6. A word is spelled correctly but the pupil does not say, “Capital,” as in 
“Capital A-u-g-u-s-t—August.” The teacher, because of the omission, con- 
siders the word incorrect although capitalization is a device of writing and 
printing since there are no oral capitals. 
c. Ina written spelling lesson a pupil wrote a word incorrectly but cor- 
rected his mistake independently and honestly before handing in his paper. 
The teacher discovering that a change had been made marked the word 
incorrect. 
d, A teacher gave very many inety-nines in written spelling but never a 
hundred even though all words were correctly spelled. When asked about 
the matter by her pupils she justified herself by saying that no human being 
could ever do anything perfectly and often quoted    
   
    
         
    
        
           “He who thinks a faultless piece of work to see 
Thinks what ne’er was, nor is, nor e’er will be.” 
e. In the study of the Revolutionary War a class was required to learn 
the spelling of all person and place names, the teacher insisting that this} 
was the simplest way to insure correct pronunciation without which pupils} 
could not talk about the events described. 
f. In preparation of a reading lesson pupils were required to write in 
lists, according to number of syllables in each, all the words in a paragraph,

you may pick five you would include and tell why you think they are hard. 
Donald, Myrtle, and Marion may be a committee to select twenty-five 
words from all the lists. 
z. Pronounce words to be written horizontally instead of in vertical lists 
in order that they may occasionally need division into syllables at the end 
of a line. Words divided incorrectly are counted wrong as if misspelled. 
j. A city superintendent sends from his office each week one current 
newspaper word likely to prove troublesome in spelling. Every room and 
class in the system masters this word. 
k. The teacher dictates for written spelling a sentence containing a word 
in the lesson studied. Pupils write more or less original sentences contain- 
ing the same word; e. g., the teacher says 
“The apple fell from the tree.” 
one pupil writes 
“T like apple pie.” 
another 
“The apple basket is full.” 
I, Daily each pupil hands his teacher a signed slip containing two words 
he considers difficult. After two weeks these are returned to determine how 
many of his own list each is able to spell. 
m. “There is no school this afternoon as most of you are to attend the fair. 
Your spelling lesson for to-morrow is to find three important words there 
and learn to spell them. Be sure you get important ones.” (Fourth grade.) 
22. “Spelling is more nearly a natural gift than any other fundamental 
school activity. Yet any person could have been so helped in school that he 
would never have written a letter in which there were misspelled words.” 
How much of this quotation is true according to your experience? 
23. Occasionally a pupil is found whose spelling seems to show all types 
of mistakes as well as great inconsistency, the same word being spelled in 
several ways within a few lines. The following is condensed from a paper of a 
first year high school pupil. 
“That individual throuly belives that beginers shloud have great 
adaptably. He hasent the fundamentels of familar speach and 
uncouncisly but nessarly gives expression bad form. Alouth he 
probaly comphends his subjects successfuly he begens to depend to 
much upon imagation of thoes who cannot immately graspe what 
he means. To get his meaning acrosse and make an indeable im- 
pression he must do more dramazing. His inclanation is to use 
the worng words in describing scenry.” 
What can be done to improve the spelling of such a pupil?

upon written work corrected and returned to them. Following are some of 
the results: 
breakman—because I got it mixed with break. 
oversear—spelled it like sea. 
asparagrass—missed because it sounded like that. 
—thought last syllable was gras. 
goard—spelled it like board is spelled. 
current (for currant)—mixed it with current events, 
perculator—It sounded that way. 
scelery—had the sound of s. 
Wisconson—last syllable pronounced like son. 
After returning a week’s spelling papers to your classes ask them to ex- 
plain in somewhat the same way all their misspelled words. 
26. Select ten words misspelled by yourself or your pupils. Account for 
the misspelling in each case. How can your explanations be turned to ac- 
count in helping pupils to spell correctly? Remember that the teaching 
of spelling must secure and fix correct forms. Give illustrations of mistakes 
which pupils should be asked to explain. Give other cases of misspelling

27. Dissatisfaction with the poor spelling of pupils employed by busi- 
ness men brought about the following results in various high schools. Select 
the solution of the problem which you consider best, or propose one which 
you approve more fully than any of these: 
a, Acertain board of education required every pupil throughout his four- 
year course to study spelling every day. Good spellers found this a weari- 
some loss of time, poor spellers received no more attention than those who 
needed none, and teachers, not taking the order seriously, accorded it only a 
formal and perfunctory compliance. Those who had complained about the 
poor spelling, however, were satisfied for several years, since they reasoned 
that, because all pupils were studying spelling, improvement must result. 
b. All first year pupils were required to study spelling. At the end of the 
first and of each succeeding school year, those who had maintained a certain 
grade (90%) were excused from spelling during the remainder of their high 
school course. The per cent excused at the end of the first year was very 
large; of those who remained in the spelling class after the end of the 
second year, few made any further gain in spelling ability. 
c. The high school principal distributed among the business men spe- 
cially prepared sheets asking them to write twenty or more words commonly 
misspelled in their business. Those asked codperated willingly and returned 
many lists, though the actual number of different misspelled words was not 
very great owing to the repetition of common words. Fifty of these words 
were placed upon the blackboard of a study hall each month, two weeks 
were given for their study and all were examined upon the list. Those who 
made less than ninety per cent in the examination were required to take 
work in a regular spelling class during the next month. Of one list, only 
three words were misspelled by a group of sixty pupils. 
d, The principal and teachers agreed upon a standard of ninety-eight per 
cent of correct spelling for all prepared written work handed in to teachers. 
Papers clearly below this standard were returned marked “Unread because 
of incorrect spelling,” and pupils were required to rewrite or correct such 
papers before they were accepted. The attitude taken was that it was no 
more polite to hand in a poorly spelled paper than one which was soiled, 
torn, or illegible. Pupils offering several unacceptable papers were also re- 
quired to enter a spelling class from which no one was excused until his 
written work maintained the proper standard for at least a month. 
e. All written work was placed under supervision of a member of the 
English staff systematically responsible for results. Whenever a pupil’s 
spelling in notebooks, themes, term papers, or written reviews showed more

than one per cent of misspelled words—approximately one to the page—he 
was required to enter a spelling class (called by pupils the hospital) and 
remain in it until marked improvement resulted. Several pupils were in the 
spelling class four years; others were never in it. 
28. In some schools the attempt is made to confine spelling lessons to 
words used and for the most part to those actually misspelled by pupils. 
What arguments may be alleged against this plan? 
29. A pupil has three vocabularies, conversational, reading, and written. 
Which determines the number of words he should spell? How is the study 
of spelling related to the other two? 
30. According to the Ayres Scale the words in column A are as difficult 
for fifth grade pupils as those in column B for eighth graders.

Compare the lists as to 
a, the number of silent letters. 
b. the number of sounds which could be and often are represented by 
other letters. 
c. degree to which words are commonly used. 
d. probability of confusion with other words. 
As a result of your study, what makes the second list more difficult than 
the first? From a spelling book, select lists as difficult for sixth and seventh 
grades as these are for fifth and eighth? 
31. What are the main considerations in selecting words which children 
are to be required to spell during their course in the elementary school? 
Aside from the selection of a proper vocabulary, what is involved in making 
a spelling textbook? From a number of spelling books select the one you 
would prefer to use in teaching, showing specifically and by means of illus- 
tration the points in which it is superior to others? 
32. What is gained by having each pupil make his own spelling book? 
If this plan were adopted and continued for a school year, in what degree 
would you expect the words in all books of the same grade to be alike? 
33. Expand the scale on page 78 for judging the merit of spelling 
textbooks by making full explanation of what should be included under 
each of the twelve heads. The scale is weighted, that is, the per cent is sug- 
gested for a perfect score on each of the twelve points. If you do not agree 
with thisweighting, redistribute the per cents, keeping the total one hundred, 
By means of the scale, grade and rank three or more spelling books, 
34. Without giving pupils opportunity for study, pronounce the follow- 
ing list of words to the class for written spelling. Have papers corrected and 
the misspelled words listed at the close of the lesson, pupils being asked to 
explain why each word was misspelled; e. g., q-u-i-e-t (for quite) “I got quite 
and quiet mixed;” f-o-u-r-t-y, “I spelled it like four;” d-r-o-w-n-d-e-d, “It 
sounded that way.” (See list below.) 
Next teach the list of words thoroughly so that each pupil can spell every 
word, 
The day after you are sure that all have learned to spell these words, give 
the accompanying dictation, not as a spelling lesson and preferably not at 
the spelling period, saying nothing about spelling. 
Willie was coming across the room to ask the teacher an important ques- 
tion. She always seemed quite willing to help anyone of the forty whose 
troubles really included almost everything. “Teacher,” he whispered at 
Jength, “what does tyrant mean?” The teacher said, “A tyrant is a bad, 
wicked ruler.” She probably added, “I am pleased on account of your

the word in a sentence.” Willie worked as if he were moving a mountain 
and this is the sentence the teacher received: “Because Sam took an article

matter? 
35. The list below includes twenty words commonly mispronounced. A 
general test of progress in teaching pronunciation may be made by finding 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  80 The Technique of Teaching 
how many in each grade mispronounce these. If proper preparation is made 
one teacher may test thirty pupils in ten or fifteen minutes. Prepare as 
many written or typed lists as there are pupils to be tested, writing a pupil’s 
name on each. Call pupils from the room one at a time for the test; let 
each pronounce rapidly from a list posted or placed in his hand, the teacher 
checking upon his individual list words not pronounced correctly. The 
results may be tabulated by rooms or rural districts, by grades, and for the 
entire system. They should show which words are the greatest offenders, 
what progress is being made from grade to grade, reveal to individual pupils 
a specific objective in overcoming wrong pronunciation, and assuredly fo- 
calize attention upon this troublesome group of words. Local lists may be 
used in the same way.

CHAPTER THREE 
THE TEACHING OF READING AND LITERATURE 
The purposes of reading. 1. A mecessary art. Reading 
is a necessary art of civilization. Illiteracy is considered a 
national or state disgrace because it is recognized that citizens 
who cannot read are without choice in being restricted to a 
narrow horizon. The illiterate may be timid or ultraconserva- - 
tive or he may develop the more dangerous attitude of the 
radical. We have been accused of teaching all to read and 
none to think, but public opinion is far safer and more sanely 
progressive than in any country suffering from the ignorance 
which accompanies inability to read. Fancied evils very real 
to the superstition of ignorance are often found to be a mental 
fiction when all read; the rashness which ignores or defies 
actual dangers is restrained by increasing the number who 
read with intelligence. 
The illiterate is likely to depend upon wrong leadership; 
one who reads, even though it be but one side of a controverted 
point, is hardly so ready to be stampeded into a wrong position. 
His opinion is checked and balanced to an extent by others 
who read. Public opinion as an influential factor could not 
exist before reading became general; it is not difficult to pile 
up evidence to prove that sane public sentiment and even 
liberal government itself depend for their safety upon reading 
citizens. 
2. Reading enriches life through increase of experience. All 
who read may have a wider world, impossible for direct 
participation. No one, for example, can attend an ancient 
Roman chariot race, but its great thrill may be shared by all 
who read an artistic or dramatic account of one. Through 
81 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  82 The Technique of Teaching 
reading, millions enjoy a great ball game though they may be 
far from where it is played and may not actually witness a 
game in years. Reading changes the plane of experience. 
Not many may associate directly with the leaders of the world; 
in books and newspapers we may learn the thoughts and hear 
the words of the greatest who are now living or have ever 
lived. A reader may experience the remote in distance or 
time and thereby increase the amount of his life. Reading 
for enjoyment, pleasure, or information is a refined use of 
leisure. 
3. Reading is a practical art. It is demanded of all in modern 
civilized life. The illiterate is at a disadvantage in finding 
his way on the street; he cannot utilize the printed directions 
that even most unskilled laborers are expected to compre- 
hend. He cannot be placed in a position of responsibility 
for the risk is too great. The modern industrial world is built 
upon the assumption that all can read. 
4. Reading is the fundamental school art. The arithmetic 
problem is unsolvable — not from its mathematical difficulties 
but because the pupil cannot read; the history lesson is un- 
interesting because pupils cannot pronounce the words — can- 
not read; current events exercises often limp for the same 
reason. 
Two purposes in teaching reading. 1. One purpose of 
teaching reading is to give pupils mastery of its mechanics. 
No amount of decrying attention to formal phases of the 
subject can remove necessity for doing this work well. Un- 
fortunate is the child whose reading experience leaves him 
with only mechanical acquaintance with the art or who has 
a hatred for all reading because of undue emphasis upon forms. 
He says with Punch, “Now I can truly read, and I will never 
read anything in the world.” Equally unfortunate is one who 
never learns to read with ease and fluency. The result in 
either case is the same; both mean that the pupil will read as
-P-A-G-E-91
  The Teaching of Reading and Literature 83 
little as possible throughout life, unless his later experiences 
are sufficient to correct mistakes made in teaching him to 
tead. 
2. On the content side, the purpose of teaching reading 
is to acquaint the pupil with as much good literature as 
possible in such a way that he will care to pursue his acquain- 
tance. Reading must be enjoyed if it is to stimulate interest 
in continuing the “reading habit.” It is also reasonable to 
assume that progressively in the grades a taste for stronger 
and higher class literature may be developed. A fourth grade 
pupil who reads “St. Nicholas” or the “Youth’s Companion’ will 
probably continue to read these, adding a daily newspaper 
and popular magazines to his list by the time he reaches the 
eighth grade. During the high school course, without dropping 
altogether his earlier friends, he should be showing appre- 
ciation of our better magazines. 
In discussions of teaching reading, the purposes are some- 
times briefly set forth as thought getting and thought giving. 
Reading is described as intelligent and intelligible; it is also 
classed as oral and silent. These terms though loosely used 
in method literature are readily understood. Evidently oral 
reading is used directly for thought giving though the silent 
reader may be acquiring content to give later. Intensive 
and extensive are terms used to indicate the thoroughness 
with which a selection is read. Classics read carefully in class 
and discussed are intensively studied; those assigned for 
home-reading or as mere sight material are being treated 
extensively. 
At what age should children learn to read? In this country 
the answer has been six years. Occasional exceptions have 
always been found in cases where parents or others taught 
children much earlier, and the practice in England has often 
been to begin the teaching of reading at the age of three or 
four.. Educational theorists have suggested that pupils would 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  84 The Technique of Teaching 
lose nothing if the subject were deferred to the age of eight, 
basing their opinions largely upon observation of children 
from homes in which there has been leisure and disposition 
to furnish profitable non-literary education during the child’s 
sixth and seventh years. The limited amount of experimental 
evidence so far collected, indicates that those who learn to 
read later than the usually accepted age are not so quick or 
accurate as the average earlier beginner of the same age when 
the fourth grade is reached. The principal arguments for 
both sides of the question are those which follow. 
1. Arguments for deferring the teaching of reading. 
a. Children’s eyes are not ready for the fine coérdinations 
necessary in learning to use books. 
6. More concrete knowledge is needed before perplexing 
the child with symbols of thought. There are better ways 
of increasing and bringing into order his narrow, personal 
experience. 
c. The process, being unintelligent, possesses no motive. 
d. Bad mental habits are fixed since the child lacks ability 
to work to best advantage. Since young pupils have slightly 
developed power of attention, nervous strain or wandering 
attention may result. 
e. The process is too individual to be pushed upon pupils 
during their most individualistic stage. 
f. Reading can be learned in less time later. 
2. Arguments for beginning early or at the usual time. 
a. Children can learn well at six: many eminent persons 
have learned earlier — at three or four. 
b. The widening of the child’s world through reading — 
socialization — may well begin early. 
c. Experimental evidence tends to show that later learners 
are handicapped. 
d. As the public school is organized and equipped, reading 
is the easiest form of profitable experience to give, If starting
-P-A-G-E-93
  
The Teaching of Reading and Literature 85 
pupils to reading were not possible, most teachers would not 
know what to do with them. Other experiences may be of 
even greater value than learning to read, but who knows how 
to organize and convey these experiences? Certainly not the 
teacher with thirty or more pupils to keep profitably occupied. 
This would not constitute a valid argument for beginning 
reading early if it could be established that something else 
is worth more to the child, but no practical change will be 
made without weighing this phase of the problem. 
Stories for primary grades. The appropriate content of 
primary reading is a fund of stories. Their value in reorganiz- 
ing child experience, vocabulary and expression development, 
motivation and foundation for mechanics of the reading 
process, is evident. In selecting stories their nature must 
be scrutinized narrowly; they should not only be good but 
should be the best for their purpose. 
Characteristics of stories. Stories should have permanent 
value, a few of the world’s great stories being learned by all. 
Common possession of such literary treasures constitutes a 
bond of social cohesion or consciousness of kind so necessary 
for development of sympathy and codperation. Perhaps we 
have too many stories; assuredly none but the best need be 
used. If only great stories are employed there will be no lack 
of situations involving moral judgment, and the universally 
known stories are more interesting than those of the ephemeral 
collections with which many children both at home and at 
school become acquainted. 
1. Adaptability. Stories should be adapted to the needs 
of small children. Primary pupils usually care for each of 
the following: 
a. An element of mystery. Not all need be understood 
in order to be interesting. Part of the mystery may be in the 
manner of telling: much may well be in the story itself. 
b. An element of fancy. A child likes to pretend: no one 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  86 The Technique of Teaching 
first tells him stories that are not literally true; he imagines 
them for himself. He will find or invent opportunity to make 
believe. He is animistic; his lack of experience and his imagina- 
tion cause him to see strange sights and ask strange questions. 
“I saw a cat’s nest high in the tree,” “What did the dog say?” 
“We hear the trees talking,” “Who is the moon’s mother?” 
are products of children’s spontaneous invention. 
c. Repetition. Stories which repeat much of their content 
make little tax upon the child’s limited power of attention 
and so are easily followed. Freed to some extent from the 
necessity of hearing all details, he often seems to spend part 
of his energy in seeing that the story is told each time without 
the slightest variation; change a word and he corrects the 
narrator. The child is likely to oppose innovations in stories 
as he does in games. Cumulative repetition stories such as 
“The House that Jack Built” employ the circular reaction 
tendencies of young children in fixing vocal and language 
habits. 
d. Action. Primary stories should abound in action. De- 
scriptions should be absent or very brief and conversations 
should be in short sentences. 
e. Imagery. Primary stories must be rich in clear-cut, well- 
known images. The story bear may not be a scientifically 
described creature, but he is a bear—not a mere wild animal. 
2. Stories before learning to read. Stories are valuable 
attention material before the pupil has learned to concentrate 
long upon anything. He listens with interest longer to a story 
than to almost anything else. Stories carry the beginning of 
literary experience. In the best homes a story foundation 
has been laid; why defer pupils’ acquaintance with literature 
until he has had time to learn reading? 
If the story-telling teacher is master of such arts of expres- 
sion as manner, gesture, and blackboard sketching, the pupil 
gains speech and expression habits through imitation. In
-P-A-G-E-95
The Teaching of Reading and Literature 87 
draxnatization, he is given opportunity for real practice in 
what is not less vital for effective reading than are the actual 
mechanics of the process itself. 
Though schoolrooms are no longer the rigidly formal places 
they were once supposed to be, the story often proves a bond 
of sympathy between a timid pupil and his teacher, effectually 
breaking any tenseness in the classroom situation. 
3. Suggestions for story telling. Know the pupil. No stranger 
can quite meet the level of the skillful classroom teacher 
acquainted with her pupils. Language and allusions to school- 
room and other familiar events are used with greater effect 
if both teacher and pupil are aware that each understands. 
a. Know the story. A logical outline should be followed, 
a single viewpoint maintained, and the story learned but 
usually not memorized. Part of the reason why the old favorite 
is a better success than the equally good, unknown story is 
that the teacher really knows the former. Most story-telling 
failures are due to the fact that the narrator does not know 
readily where he is going. In such case he usually goes no- 
where and leaves the class in the same place so far as the 
story is involved. A story is not well enough known to risk 
telling until it can be told from start to finish without a single 
hesitation, giving proper emphasis, using facial expression 
and gesture without apparent effort. 
b. Use simple, forceful, correct English. Poor language, 
slang, or absurd baby talk is not essential to the success 
of any story; their use lays the foundation for later trouble. 
Pupils will talk badly enough without the teacher’s example 
to imitate. 
c. Avoid gaps, explanations, and all stops. If the story 
as you find it contains such breaks, descriptive passages 
perhaps, omit them. By such adaptations many otherwise 
unsuitable stories may be turned to excellent account. By 
a similar process of adaptation, stories which are too short
-P-A-G-E-96
  88 The Technique of Teaching 
or too long may be made suitable. If the gaps are due to 
poor telling, cure the fault by practicing before an intelligent 
critic — another teacher if possible. 
d. Use vivid means. Facial, dramatic, and _ illustrative 
emphasis count; modulation of the voice secures the emphasis 
of contrast, the loud or high yielding to the soft or low in tone; 
rapid and slow expression heighten the effect of language itself. 
e. Utilize dramatic means. Use direct style, talking to 
characters, not about them; let story characters talk whenever 
they can be made to. Secure self activity through dramatiza- 
tion, pupils taking parts in the story and playing it. In dra- 
matizing as in telling stories, repetition plays its part, pupils 
wishing the same little drama with slight variation day after 
day. 
4. Kinds of stories. Story interests should be lifelong. The 
child who has had the right story experience may not as an 
adult devote much of his time to fables, Mother Goose, or 
the classic stories of history but these are so much a part of 
his mental make-up that he recognizes them in his reading, 
uses them in his speech, and not infrequently translates 
their childish meaning into a more mature interpretation of 
life experience. “Sly as a fox,” “greedy as a wolf,” “wise as an 
owl” are far more literary than zodlogical but they are useful 
common conceptions. It is the high school pupil without 
early acquaintance with stories who finds historical legends 
and myths dull. Evidently selection of stories must give 
representation to all important types. 
a. Mother Goose stories and jingles. The narrative ele- 
ment in this well-known type is the minimum. Simplicity, 
clear cut images, rhythm, and rhyme are their dominant 
characteristics. These are most nearly the self-teaching type; 
to most children their appeal is immediate; like candy or 
ice-cream, they seem worth while. 
b. Fables. Old as the race, these usually represent highly
-P-A-G-E-97
The Teaching of Reading and Literature 89 
idealized animals in the réle of well-known human types and 
characteristics. The lion, as the king of beasts, must behave 
in kingly fashion, defiantly stalking about to seek prey even 
though the real lion may be a lazy animal which lies in wait 
all day to catch a field rat. As a rule the fabled animal simply 
acts or speaks as a clever, stupid, honest, or bungling man 
might. Such stories usually give very pointedly one moral 
which mere familiarity is likely to make permanent in value. 
Moralizing a fable — the haec fabula docet of other days — is 
ineffective. 
c. Folk stories and myths. Folk stories, usually traditional 
among arace or people, are often, though not always, mythical. 
They shade imperceptibly into historical legends and stories. 
A myth may in most cases be traced to an attempt to explain 
natural phenomena. Thunder is caused by Thor’s hammer; 
the earthquake means that Atlas is shifting his load. Later 
these become a background for interpreting movements and 
events. Cain and Abel represent opposition between agri- 
cultural and pastoral interests; Abraham and Lot, the migra- 
tion of related peoples. In addition to being the truest por- 
trayal of shepherd life, Bible stories, because of their moral 
strength and universal familiarity, are an indispensable 
element of education. The child who grows up ignorant of 
these has missed an important heritage. 
d. Fairy stories. The freedom of the fairy story gives it 
a value all its own. In real life there are always the obstacles 
of actual environment which cannot be swept aside at will. 
Travelers are said to tell the best stories because free from 
the necessity of conforming to reality as experienced by their 
auditors; in the same way a fairy story is of its own kingdom, 
that of fancy. The poor child is as happy with the rag doll 
as the rich with a doll princess. No one remains long poor, 
cold, or hungry in a fairy story; one may travel at will, un- 
limited by time, distance, or walls, in an ideal world.  
-P-A-G-E-98
  
90 The Technique of Teaching 
Unless fairy tales are told so exclusively that the child 
confuses hopelessly his sense of values, no valid objection 
may be urged to their use. Most intelligent children have a 
world of fancy which they keep separated from real things; 
they do not believe in brownies or fairies as in parents and 
playmates. The stick horse must have a make-believe drink; 
the play of fancy makes its own rules. Fairy stories do not 
deceive children nor undermine their confidence in serious 
things. 
Psychology of the reading process. 1. Habit and associa- 
tion. The rate of even the slowest intelligible reading is so 
fast as to suggest that habit must occupy a large place in the 
process. The association of symbol with meaning and pro- 
nunciation once being made, it must be repeated often enough 
to become automatic. This “reading momentum,” familiarity 
acquired by frequent repetition, accounts for the ability to 
read even though relatively little is actually seen as the page 
is traversed. That this is true may be shown in many inter- 
esting ways, and better comprehension of the reading process 
will result from making such observations as those suggested 
in the following: 
a. In word recognition, the first part of a word is more im- 
portant than the last. Because strenis most often followed by 
gth, no hesitation ensues if the last three letters of strength 
are omitted. In some passages reading is still possible if the 
second half of a large per cent of words is deleted. Association 
and habit render possible such reading ahead without which 
there could be no fluency. 
6. Similarly the lower half of a line may be removed without 
serious inconvenience to the reader. This and the foregoing 
prove conclusively that one does not see letters as he reads 
but recognizes words by their general appearance. 
c. At the close of a page it is often possible to finish reading 
a sentence, half of which has not been seen. Likewise, facile
-P-A-G-E-99
  The Teaching of Reading and Literature 91 
readers are able to spend an appreciable part of the time, if 
reading familiar material, in looking over their audience. 
They read many words without seeing them at all. 
d. The importance of vocabulary habits is occasionally 
brought home by cases in which a familiar sequence is modi- 
fied slightly. The actual page may contain, “He was not only 
a good linguist but sometimes a clever debater” which will 
be read, “He was not only a good linguist but also a clever 
debater.” A seventh grade pupil read several times without 
discovering his mistake, “I wish you a merry Christmas and 
a happy New Year,” although the part of the expression 
given here in italics was entirely absent. The same form of 
mental expectancy through habit causes either to be followed 
by or and both by and, even when the second member of the 
pair is lacking. 
e. The importance of habit in the mechanics of reading 
may also be seen in the movements of the eye. The eye 
moves from left to right, stopping at fixation points where the 
actual reading is done. The number of fixation points depends 
upon the length of line and its difficulty or unfamiliarity; 
usually three to five stops are sufficient for a capable reader 
in ordinary prose sight reading. If a finger is laid lightly across 
the lid of one eye while the other reads, fixation stops are 
easily detected. By placing a mirror upon the left page of a 
book when a person is reading the right, and looking over his 
shoulder into the mirror as he reads, the eye movements may 
also be detected. They are too rapid to be counted easily or 
accurately. As has been suggested, the amount seized at 
each fixation point is roughly proportional to the ease or 
familiarity of the selection, showing clearly the importance 
of habit. The eye on its return to the left of the next line does 
no reading. Until habits are well fixed, pupils occasionally 
lose themselves upon the wrong line. As an aid, markers are 
someti:nes provided to slide down the page a line at a time.

  92 The Technique of Teaching 
2. Rate of reading. The goal in teaching is to develop rapid 
readers. There is sometimes confusion between “rapid” 
readers and “hurried” readers. One who cannot read rapidly 
without being conscious of his effort at speed would much 
better proceed at a rate really his own. While one should thus 
read at his “normal” rate, teachers should realize that much 
depends upon the devices used in teaching. Inability to read 
rapidly is so serious a disadvantage that it should be limited 
to the comparatively small number whose mental movement 
itself is exceedingly slow. Those who read rapidly are in 
general more accurate and probably retain most content. A 
pupil reading ten pages while his slower classmate read three 
might not remember more per page but he has gathered over 
a much larger field. If he had spent all his time upon three 
pages he might have read each several times with increased 
probability of retention due to repetition. The best standard 
of measurement is the amount of content achieved in a given 
time rather than the reading of a specific number of pages. 
The rate of oral reading is inevitably much slower than that 
of silent. It requires time to pronounce and articulate, neither 
of which need be given full place when the sole purpose is 
following the thought. Freed from these limitations, the silent 
reading rate is limited only by mechanism of the eye, ability 
* to attend repeatedly in quick succession, and necessity of 
interpretation. 
To increase the rate of reading, word drills should be brought 
to the level of instantaneous recognition; lip movements should 
usually be discouraged in silent reading; all devices which 
focalize attention upon the individual word, such as pointing 
to each word in primary reading, should be kept out of reading 
proper; competitive speed drills in both oral and silent reading 
may be employed to stimulate slow pupils. 
A table indicating standard norms for rate in oral and silent 
reading is given. These are for grades rather than for individual
-P-A-G-E-101
_ The Teaching of Reading and Literature 93 
pupils, among whom there is always considerable variation. 
It will be noted that up to theclose of the third grade thereis 
no great difference between the rate of oral and that of silent 
reading.

3. Subjective and objective readers. From the foregoing it 
should be evident that the content of the child’s mind inter- 
acts with the printed page when he is reading. In a sense 
“he reads himself by means of the page;” he reads himself 
into the page. If nothing is there (in his mind) or little is 
there, he cannot read or reads little and very badly. Upon 
the basis of mind content and contact with the printed page 
it is usually possible and profitable to classify pupils as sub- 
jective or objective readers. There can be no clearly dis- 
tinguished or exclusive types; all are somewhat subjective 
and to some extent objective, but some are highly of one or 
the other type. Since intelligent analysis of any class will 
discover pupils strongly of each type, it seems worth while 
to set forth at some length the characteristics of each group. 
Subjective readers 
depend largely upon what is in their minds, 
read with understanding. 
consequently, read with expression.

or come from homes where reading is done. 
Objective readers 
a. depend too much upon what is on the page; too conscious 
of words. Like the one who cannot “see the woods because 
of individual trees,” such readers let the words come between 
them and larger effects or thoughts. 
b. likely to read with little understanding. 
¢. read with poor expression, 
d. read with hesitation, stumblingly, and with repetition. 
e. intent upon individual words— pronounce even by

f. rarely omit words unless so slow that place is lost. 
g. not likely to substitute words; if substitutes are made, 
they are unrelated, more likely to resemble in appearance 
than in thought. 
h. lose the thought or place on the page. 
1, do little reading outside of school; come from unin- 
telligent homes, 
In general, those who read too subjectively are less a problem 
than are the objective readers. The subjective readers more 
quickly become able to read extensively for their own satis- 
faction. The following suggestions are pertinent in dealing 
with this type: 
(1) It is not a pedagogical crime to interrupt such readers 
in the middle of a line though politeness is not inculcated by 
this means. 
(2) When reading departs too much from what is on the
-P-A-G-E-103
  
The Teaching of Reading and Literature 95 
page, have the pupil point to each word as he reads. This 
will not endanger fluency as it would with objective readers. 
(3) After a sentence has been read with too much substitu- 
tion, ask, “What was that?” “Would that seem reasonable?” 
“Did the line say exactly that?” and similar questions adapted 
to the content of what has been read. 
It is one of the large purposes of the teacher to transform 
too objective readers into a more subjective type. The objec- 
tive reader in primary grades needs, so to speak, to get on 
the reading track, go, and keep going. Suggestions for dealing 
with this type are 
(1) Never stop such a pupil for mistakes in pronunciation 
or other minor errors. Let him go on. 
(2) Let him read aloud only familiar selections so that he 
will not be made conscious of words by the presence of those 
which are unfamiliar. Develop the ideal of no stops. 
(3) Have memorized and repeated aloud a few standard 
selections of best form. Too much of the inverted word order 
often found in poetry should not be given at once. The purpose 
of such memorizing is to build word, phrase, group, and ex- 
pression sequences which are the linguistic raw material of 
reading. 
(4) Puta premium upon extensive reading by placing within 
reach an abundance of easy supplementary material which 
possesses gripping interest. Even if reading is only for the 
story, its purpose is being attained. 
(5) Build the pupil’s vocabulary; that is, enlarge his expe- 
rience. Get him to talk about almost anything with which he 
is familiar. 
A list of all who are highly subjective and highly objective 
may be made and the mistakes of each recorded for the teach- 
er’s guidance. Above the first four grades, unless highly 
sensitive or nervous, each pupil may well be made specifically 
conscious of the type of mistake he is likely to make.
-P-A-G-E-104
  96 The Technique of Teaching 
Motivation. Lack of effective motivation gives much of the 
teaching of reading the perfunctory nature from which no 
love of more reading is likely to arise. Habits of wandering 
attention, disciplinary troubles, and distaste for the school 
itself are other results of making pupils read when they see 
nothing in the process. 
1. Reading for enjoyment. The functional view of pedagogy 
applied to the teaching of reading would insist that so far as 
possible, the pupil should read in school for the same reason 
that reading is done out of school — to find out, to enjoy, or 
to entertain or enlighten others. Examples of these real or 
life motives may be encountered frequently in child litera- 
ture. In the semi-pedagogical Sandford and Merton (written 
in 1783-1789), the model industrious Harry read stories to 
Tommy, who was too lazy to learn reading. Harry being absent 
a week and the tutor deliberately too busy to help the lazy 
lad, Tommy became very willing to work, since it was a case 
of work or no story, and soon learned the reading art. A 
similar effect of real motive is found in Kipling’s Baa-Baa Black 
Sheep. Punch, having suffered the stupidity of his primer until 
he could read, was putting it away forever, intending to be done 
with all reading, when he tumbled from its shelf a story book 
which at once made him a reader with an immediate purpose. 
Books on story telling occasionally inform us that after 
a pupil has heard stories told, he will work hard in order to 
get the stories for himself. This is a real but very remote 
appeal; the fact that parents and others known to the pupil 
are able to read, exercises its influence; the pupil comes to 
school with the vague expectation of learning to read as others 
have done and are doing. Skillfully directed, the undertaking 
becomes a vital project with a remote goal. 
2. School motives. The more general appeals so far sug- 
gested are not sufficient in most schools to entice children far 
enough along the literary path to accomplish reading ability.
-P-A-G-E-105
The Teaching of Reading and Literature 97 
Devices in plenty, which have frankly only a school value, 
must be used. In functional devices, reading becomes a means 
to an end in games or work; such devices should usually have 
the right of way merely because they are likely to be a more 
interesting means, but no teacher should feel disgraced at 
being compelled to use others whose only justification is that 
they work, thus actually helping the pupil in learning to read. 
There is no evidence that temporary dissociation of reading 
from its racial purpose in order to master its mechanics inter- 
feres with its fullest enjoyment or legitimate use later. 
Several typical devices are suggested by way of illustration. 
a. Devices in which reading is made to achieve its real function. 
(1) Children’s names on cards which they read, respond 
to, and use in calling each other in their games. 
(2) Write action words for silent reading: pupils read and 
perform the action; e. g., come, go, run, jump, hop, stand. 
Similarly use action sentences; e. g., 
Harry, bring the book. 
Kate, hop and jump. 
(3) School signals can be put in writing and thus read as 
commands or requests. 
(4) Questions upon the lesson may also be written and used 
as silent reading to be answered at a given signal; e. g., 
How many children in the story? 
Find the longest word in the lesson. 
(5) Pupil reads new story to the class. 
b. “School devices.” 
(1) Competitive devices. Keep pupils of the first year 
aware of their progress by letting them know how many words 
they have mastered at sight; e. g., 
Mary is in the twenty word group. 
Kate is in the forty word group.
-P-A-G-E-106
  98 The Technique of Teaching 
(2) Speed drills, especially those in which the pupil en- 
deavors to improve his own record rather than to excel others. 
(3) Reading rebuses; e. g., 
The 3p are on the sie 
A Sd built Gh. in a ie 
(4) Filling ellipses with suitable words as the pupil reads; e.g., 
Iseea.... dog. 
Bring mea.... kiteand... . piece of string. 
Such sentences may be selected from old readers; pupils 
may write them, leaving out words which they believe others 
can supply. 
(5) Anagrams and miscellaneous word games; e. g., 
How many words can you make with one set of 
alphabet cards? 
How many with one set including duplicates of vowels? 
See also sight word devices, phonic devices, and 
spelling devices on pages 63, 106, I12. 
3. Dramatization. For ease of speech and Sestiidtiel of 
speech habits which are so large a part of ability to read, no 
exercise excels dramatization. It does much to preserve spon- 
taneity of expression which the school is so often accused of 
killing. Dramatization also effectively tests understanding 
of selections which have been studied. 
Pupils should be encouraged to make suggestions, try them 
out, and in class conversation evaluate them. Plans grow 
with discussion. With small children the circle form of class 
seating has much to recommend it since attention is easily 
centered upon the actors who are not in this way removed 
from the midst of the group. 
Material to be dramatized should usually not be memorized. 
Perhaps an exception is the occasional classic selection whose
-P-A-G-E-107
The Teaching of Reading and Literature 99 
beauty of form is ruined by change of words even without 
essential change in content. Such selections are usually best 
dramatized only for special occasions after careful rehearsal; 
they constitute a valuable exercise but are outside the field 
of what is usually understood by dramatization in teaching 
reading. Not all selections may with profit be dramatized. 
The teacher who attempted to dramatize the story of Cain 
and Abel was farther from acting wisely than the pupil in 
her class who rendered the well-known line, “Am I my broth- 
er’s keeper?” as “I can’t be looking after my brother all 
the time; Abel will have to take care of himself.” Bringing 
all things to the child’s level to the extent of repeated expres- 
sion, in crude or incorrect form, of what should be inspiring 
sentiments, is not economy in dramatization. 
Teaching beginners. 1. Use of objects and pictures. Use 
of objects is one of the surest ways of introducing the ideas 
for which words stand. This is experience gaining rather 
than reading, but necessary nevertheless. With non-English 
speaking children objects are especially useful; such pupils 
have the needed experience and their own word but need to 
associate the English symbol with the well-known object. 
This is a vocabulary-building expedient not properly classed 
as learning to read. Profitable use of objects in teaching read- 
ing, narrowly considered, is very limited. We read with ideas 
and not with objects, and he would be a poor reader who 
stopped to image all concrete material for which the words 
ay stand. The reading of such rather idle sentences as “This 
is a man” is not furthered by the picture of a man. Without 
e illustrated page, the child pictures man at mention of the 
ord. The only new association sure to be made because of 
he illustration is that of “the page with the picture of a man 
nm it where I must say ‘man’.” Illustrations in primary 
eading books have much greater value because of the motive 
hey furnish or the enjoyment of the picture itself than because     
                   
   
                   
    
      
-P-A-G-E-108
  100 The Technique of Teaching 
of any direct aid they contribute to the reading process. 
Ever since the sixteenth century, occasional writers have 
insisted that pictures in primary books are on \the whole 
detrimental since they take attention from the main task, 
which is not enjoying illustrations or even gaining new con- 
tent but acquiring automatic associations of arbitrary symbols. 
Doubtless this is an extreme view but it suggests the necessity 
of critical scrutiny and evaluation of illustrative devices in 
primary reading. 
2. Methods. a. The a-b-c method. This well-known plan 
of teaching beginners was until recently almost universal 
in its use and is still widely employed. Most parents who teach 
their own children to read or assist in teaching them employ 
this plan. Untrained teachers still follow this method. It 
seems a logical procedure to begin with letters and continue 
through syllables to words, sentences, and paragraphs. It 
seems to begin with simplest elements and proceed to more 
complex. As a matter of fact, words and sentences are simpler 
elements to the beginning pupil than meaningless symbols, 
called letters, which he must learn by rote in the hope that 
in time these strange characters will be built into something 
with real significance. This method keeps the pupil longer 
than is necessary upon abstract material with consequent 
lack of motive. It focuses attention directly upon the letters 
with which, it it has been shown, the reading mechanics of the 
best readers are not much concerned. Combining the names 
of letters does not spell the words we pronounce, but usually 
something very different. D-O-G if approached through the 
alphabet gives dee-o-gee, whatever that may be. 
The a-b-c method in practice is seldom as bad as it is pic- 
tured by lecturers on teaching, since it quickly and inevitably 
transforms itself into a phonic procedure. It is not, however, 
the most effective plan and there is no excuse for teachers’ 
using any method but the best,
-P-A-G-E-109
  The Teaching of Reading and Literature TOL 
In this connection it may be noted that pupils should learn 
the alphabet before they have spent many years in school. 
This may not be during the first year but it ought not to be 
deferred to the fifth. Thoroughly automatic mastery of the 
alphabet is needed by all even though this in itself has little 
to do with learning to read. 
b. The word method. This method was advocated by 
Comenius, and urged upon the teachers of this country by 
Horace Mann. In combination with the sentence method 
next discussed, it is now most widely used in teaching beginners 
their first list of sight words, their reading capital until the 
phonic key for working out new words is provided. By means 
of the blackboard and some of the many devices invented 
by ingenious teachers, the pupil is made familiar with a few 
sight words each week, these being combined into sentences 
and read. While the letters may or may not be known, words 
are recognized solely by the way they look, much as if they 
were friends or playthings. Long words are not more difficult 
than those which are short, in no greater degree than a tall 
uncle is harder to remember than a short one. So far as ac- 
quiring a vocabulary of sight words is concerned, Nebuchad- 
nezzar would not be a difficult word to teach if it were worth 
while knowing; it might even be very easy since it could 
be recalled as the longest word. Ingeneral, the first words taught 
lare chosen not because they are short or easy, but for immed- 
iate use and a satisfactory foundation for phonic work. 
As has been suggested, ease of learning a word depends upon 
its characteristic appearance rather than its length. Associa- 
ion, remembering, and recognition seem to depend to a con- 
iderable extent upon striking combinations, or the presence 
f dominating — tall — letters. Most primary teachers agree 
s to the ease or difficulty of impressing the following words, 
nd the reason for their distinctiveness or lack of it: doll 
easily learned, parallel JJ at end; book — easily learned; 
     
    
                                              
 
-P-A-G-E-110
102 The Technique of Teaching 
double round letters; kitty — easily learned, tall letters and 
double ¢; never, care, and rain, on the other hand, are lacking 
in distinguishing features and so hard to teach; this is often 
confused with the. 
Words for sight learning should be from the vocabulary 
which it is planned to develop. Those which will fit in well 
with later phonic plans represent economy of effort. Action 
words lend themselves to motivated activities: they function 
quickly in schoolroom reading and play. 
c. The sentence method. The sentence method blends 
with the word method in the best teaching of reading. It 
is based upon the premise that the sentence is the unit of 
thought. In the use of such action words as go or run, the word 
is a sentence or the sentence isa word. When longer expressions 
are used pupils read the whole as a unit with better expression 
than is likely if emphasis is upon the word. Inevitably, how- 
ever, the sentence must be broken into the words which com- 
pose it. 
A common device in the use of the word-sentence method 
is to teach as sight material a sentence and to follow it with 
other sentences in which but a word is changed. This gives 
repetition and facilitates expression since almost the entire 
sentence is familiar.     
   
          
    
   
   
    
   Give me the ball. The kitty is white. 
Give me the bat. The kitty is soft. 
Give me the apple. The kitty is black. 
As beginning reading is usually taught, the word and sen- 
tence methods are combined in teaching from one hundr 
to two hundred sight words before much attention is give: 
to letters. Some pupils will begin to spell words and asi 
“What does ————— spell?” Such questions should of cour: 
be answered and increasing attention can be directed to th 
sounds of some of the more striking consonants.
-P-A-G-E-111
  The Teaching of Reading and Literature 103, 
d. The phonic method. After a small capital has been ac- 
quired in the way of sight vocabulary, the pupil must be 
given the key to working out new words for himself. The 
procedure is discussed under “Phonics.” It is sufficient here 
to indicate that with most teachers of primary reading the 
phonic method, instead of being a distinct procedure from the 
first, is a device adapted to a certain stage of teaching the child 
to read. It is well also to guard against the notion that the 
phonic stage can be distinctly delimited. It may begin while 
most of the emphasis is still being placed upon sight words 
through word and sentence method; sight words are still 
learned after phonic procedure is well under way. 
A common objection to a phonic method is that it places — 
too much attention upon words and syllables and may thus 
tend to make further trouble for those who are already too 
objective in their tendencies — inclined to see only words 
instead of sentences or thoughts. The best means of avoiding 
this real danger is to keep word drills entirely distinct from 
reading. After word drill has been thoroughly given, pupils 
will be reading familiar sight material which is the only type 
of reading that too objective readers should be allowed to 
attempt. 
A second objection to this method is that it “makes pupils 
poor spellers.” If the work is well done there will doubtless 
be an increased tendency to spell words as they sound, which 
is surely not an evil to be avoided; for, with all the incon- 
sistencies of English spelling, sound is the best guide. The 
best spellers are guided by sound but are saved by remem- 
bering many inconvenient exceptions. The pupil who spells 
phonically altogether is not so much a victim of this method 
of teaching reading as he is in need of vigorous drill upon the 
multitude of common words whose spelling is unreasonable 
and unphonic. Removing the temptation to spell words as 
they sound would not increase the number of good spellers.
-P-A-G-E-112
  104 The Technique of Teaching 
A third related difficulty is due to the fact that many of 
our letters are made to do duty in standing for more than one 
sound. The vowels and c, g,and s are among these. Phil- 
ologists have devised phonetic alphabets which serve their 
purposes. Attempts have been made repeatedly during the 
last hundred and fifty years to introduce such alphabets 
into primary reading books. An interesting old book published 
in 1782 uses nearly two hundred such characters. A line from 
this book is as follows: 
BS? oa asf 
No one can now read the book, and it is doubtful whether 
many except the too ingenious maker ever could. Many 
simpler systems have been advocated, the Funk and Wag- 
nalls “Scientific Alphabet” being among the best known of 
more recent attempts. A sentence from the first reader of 
their series follows: 
Wuns, Rip Vanwin-kl went up amung 
- - ‘. ee 
the hilz, hwar hi so cwir lit-l 
‘ 
men plé€-ing bol. 
Reforms in reading books will come when interest in al- 
phabet reform is strong enough to secure such radical changes 
in the books and papers we read outside of school. Teaching 
pupils to read would be easier if the alphabet were a better 
tool, but we shall doubtless long continue its use without 
important modifications. 
e. Imitation and combined methods. Careful observers of 
classes learning to read are impressed with the immense
-P-A-G-E-113
  The Teaching of Reading and Literature 105 
importance of imitation and repetition in acquiring the pro- 
cess. The imitation method has even been listed as a distinct 
mode of procedure. In many oriental schools it is difficult 
to observe that any specific technique is used; pupils repeat, 
sometimes sing, their words or sentences until they become 
automatic. While such a plan is uneconomical, a pupil so 
taught would probably learn to read, and it is possible the 
time required would not be much greater than what is usually 
needed even with the best of methods. The child sits in the 
corner and “reads” because he sees others reading, though at 
first he may hold the book upside down and hardly be con- 
scious of even the illustrations. Later he begins to follow 
the lines, ignorant though he may be of every letter, word, 
and sentence. After stories have been read to him, he “reads” 
the same pages, imitating tones, pronunciation, and expression 
of the one who has read to him. At school he reads page after 
page “by the pictures.” None of these represents reading 
properly so-called, but they show the degree to which imita- 
tion functions until the reading art has been acquired. While 
imitation can hardly be classed as a distinct method, it is a 
much larger factor in all methods than many teachers think. 
The combined method sometimes discussed is simply a 
recognition that in all good teaching of reading several methods 
are employed. Accepted procedure among most teachers 
begins with the word-sentence method, and gradually shifts 
partial emphasis to the phonic. Some begin to stress phonic 
elements very early —so early that there seems to be no 
particular transition from one method to another. The best 
results are probably not achieved by teachers who are over 
method-conscious. The most satisfactory textbooks, while 
adhering to a consistent treatment, do not make impossible 
the use of several methods at a time. With an eclectic atti- 
tude — willingness to use any or all of the methods described 
=-most pupils should be brought to the level indicated as 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  106 The Technique of Teaching 
reasonable attainment at the end of the first half year. At 
this time the pupil should 
Have an interest in printed page. 
Know most of the letters. 
Know the sounds of several letters. 
Recognize about two hundred sight words. 
Be familiar with about forty common phonograms. 
Have ability to stay on the line as he reads and to return 
with moderate accuracy to the next line below. 
3. Learning sight words. Whatever plan the teacher may 
emphasize, a considerable capital of sight words will be ac- 
quired during the first half year. The accompanying sug- 
gestions are in harmony with enlightened practice. 
a. About fifty sight words are learned before phonics 
receive much attention; learning of sight words continues 
to be important. 
b. Sight words may well be selected from the primer or 
reader to be placed in the hands of pupils later; sentences 
in the primer will be more vital as later reading material, 
if they have not been used exactly as they occur in the book. 
c. Each teacher and class must select their own list of 
sight words. All should be listed and systematically kept before 
the pupils, in accordance with the laws of habit formation. 
d. There is no economy in selecting short words exclusively ; 
as has been noted, it is the character of the word’s appearance 
rather than its length which accounts for ease or difficulty 
of learning. 
e. Sight words need not be chosen exclusively from phonic 
word families. Phonic preparation may well be kept in mind, 
but there is little life in such overplayed emphasis as appears, in 
A fat cat had a bad rat. 
A sad man had a hat. 
f. Abundantly vitalized drill is the secret of acquiring a 
sight word vocabulary. Variety in device alone can insure
-P-A-G-E-115
  The Teaching of Reading and Literature 107 
proper life and motive. The accompanying have been found 
helpful classroom expedients. 
(1) Action sentences. Give directions by writing words 
on the blackboard, such as 
Wave the flag. 
Call the chickens. 
Say your name. 
Shake your head. 
(2) Word cards. These may be purchased, printed with a 
typewriter or by means of rubber stamp letters. They are best 
made of uniform size and upon paper heavy enough not to 
blow away readily. With these 
Build primer sentences. 
Build sentences from dictation. 
Hide cards about the room for children to find. 
Match words on blackboard or chart with those on cards. 
Have pupils assort cards. 
Illustrate word cards; e. g., on “Kitty” card draw picture of 
kitten. 
Upon each illustrated card, write name of object in picture; 
e. g., write dog under picture of dog. 
From magazines cut pictures of dogs or horses and hang 
them on the walls of the room; children with word cards 
match them. 
Use cards in flash work—one recites, the front row recites, 
all recite and other variations. 
With cards on the blackboard ledge. Pupil or teacher calls 
for word which the one designated finds and brings. 
Choose sides; the side first naming the greatest number of 
sight word cards wins the match. 
Make cards in shape of leaves, each containing a word; 
throw them up. The pupil who catches or secures the greatest 
number and pronounces them correctly is winner, and may 
throw them up the next time.

(3) Blackboard plans. 
List of words on the blackboard; teacher or pupil points to 
word which pupils name, singly or in concert. A pupil who 
names three in succession most quickly becomes “it,” taking 
his turn at pointing. 
Place upon board two columns of sight words for review. 
Have contest between two children, each pronouncing as fast as 
he can the words of one of the columns. 
Divide blackboard into a long row of spaces (miles), each 
containing a word. Start a pupil at each end of the line pro- 
nouncing as fast as he can. Perhaps he should go back to the 
beginning if he mispronounces a word.

(4) With books. 
Teacher or pupil names word, pupils find it. 
Teacher begins to read in reader without telling exactly 
where; pupils in their own book find the place and begin read- 
ing aloud. 
Pupils mark words recognized in old readers or in news- 
papers; e. g., underline such words as the, are, and. 
Pupils clip and paste sentences from old readers. 
(5) Guessing game, “I know a word that ends in e-s-t. 
What is it?” 
(6) Use peculiarities of appearance as associations to fix 
words; e. g., write little in small letters; look has two big eyes in 
the middle. 
(7) Print or write dominant letters or first half of word for 
recognition; e. g., k tt ns, 1 til , pl y, ca , jum . 
Similarly use word groups:

4. Phonics. a. Beginnings. After a sufficient capital of 
sight words has been acquired, phonic attack is begun by 
directing attention to the sound values of letters and to com- 
monly encountered phonograms. The value or sound of letters 
may be developed in some or all the ways listed here. 
(1) By making sure the pupil hears correctly. 
(2) The letter or sound may be given an exaggerated pro- 
nunciation—f-f-f-f, s-s—s-s, z-z-z-z. 
(3) A very old device associates phonic values of letters 
with common sounds. 
The cat says f-f-f. 
The dog says g-g-g. 
One who is out of breath says h—-h-h. 
To frighten a cat we say s-s-s. 
A humming bee sounds m—m-—m.   
(4) In general, the isolating of phonic elements should begin 
with those sounds which are strongest—most characteristically 
differentiated—s, t, f, p. 
(5) Limited attention to placing the vocal organs is often of 
value to certain children in acquiring sounds. It is convenient 
for the teacher to recall that most consonants are paired as 
vocals and aspirates, the vocal organs occupying practically 
the same position for those in the same pair.

    b. Phonograms. (1) A phonogram is a combination of a 
vowel sound with a consonant sound which may be uttered as 
one syllable. A phonogram may be combined with a consonant 
sound to form a word of one syllable; e. g., fight, r—ate. 
(2) Phonograms to which attention is directed should be 
typical, and at first only those used which can be formed in but 
one way; i.e., with but one spelling; thus -d// is better than 
-eel which might also be spelled eal or ele; -ook which remains 
constant in book, cook, hook, look, nook, rook, took is preferable 
to the sound of -een which appears in bean, dean, glean, lean, 
mean, and also in green, teen, seen. 
(3) Economy requires that phonograms shall not be differ- 
entiated and taught until they have been met in sight words 
repeatedly; they should be taught inductively. After the pupil 
knows at sight can, man, hand, and others of the same family, 
it is not difficult to focalize his attention upon the phono- 
gram, an. 
(4) In most books phonograms used in primary reading are 
|final—forming the end of words as in -ight, -an, -ate, -are, 
-ame, -at, -all; in some books the initial forms are used as in 
si(t, n, ll, p, ck), ma (d, n, p, st, t). Results may be achieved 
iby either plan, provided there is no changing from one to the 
ther until impressions are fixed. 
c. The blend. (1) “Blending” is a term used to denote the 
rocess of combining the phonic value of letters with phono- 
ams; the same synthesis enables pupils to acquire new words 
or themselves. Pupils who know the sound of f and the phono- 
am -ight or -at have little trouble in arriving at f—f—f-ight or 
f-f-at. Or if initial phonograms are used, there is no greater 
ifficulty in fa—t, fi-ll, ca—n, ca-t or pa-n.  
-P-A-G-E-120
  112 The Technique of Teaching 
(2) It is sometimes claimed that a phonic method of learn- 
ing to read interferes with ready recognition of words as wholes. 
This is perhaps a danger to which the method exposes slow 
pupils or those who are so objective as to dwell too long upon 
letter elements. To prevent all such danger, the blend work 
should be repeated until it is done quickly and readily. 
d. Phonic devices. As in the development of sight words, 
varying devices lend interest and motive to drill in phonics. 
The following are typical of those used by primary 
teachers. 
(1) Phonic word cards.

  The Teaching of Reading and Literature 113 
(a) Copy sentences and words with letter cards; e. g., 
d ° g Copy from book or from blackboard. 
(Ten cards of each letter enough; not so many needed of gq, 
v, 2.) 
(b) An old mechanical de- 
vice consists of a wheel 
which revolves around the 
point o. The commonly used 
consonants are printed around 
the margin of the wheel. The 
phonograms may be upon 
cards which can be changed 
rapidly. 
(2) Using the blackboard. 
(a) With the letters on the blackboard, the teacher gives 
the sounds, pupils finding and giving name of letters. 
(b) With words on the blackboard, have pupils pronounce 
‘vigorously their phonic elements me-et, f-an. Have this done 
in concert and individually. 
(c) Write on the board the key phonograms—-and, -end. 
rite also a list of initial letters — b, gr, h, 1, s, 7, w, bl. From 
hese ask pupils to make words. Similarly try -eat, -each, 
all, -oil. 
(d) After hilland will have been learned as sight words, 
tite on the board h-/] and w-ilJ. From these work out b-wil, 
ill, m-ill, t-ill. 
(3) With reading books before them, the teacher names the 
ord and its phonic elements which pupils find and name. 
(4) Teacher or pupil says, “I am thinking of a word that 
egins with m-m-m.”—“It sounds like ” or “It means 
” may be added. The pupil who guesses the word 
ay give the next.

(6) A commonly used device is 
“winding the clock.” A phonogram 
is placed in the center with conso- 
nants or consonant combinations in 
place of figures on the dial. 
e. Rhyme in phonics. The use of 
rhyme in learning to read is a partly 
phonic means of acquiring sight 
words based upon the rhyme instinct. 
The rhyming device has been in 
school books for hundreds of years. 
With most children the rhyming quality seems to render 
memorizing easy, and in some commonly used “methods” use 
is made of rhyme to assist in word recognition. If sentences 
are planned so that the pupil knows that the new word rhymes 
with one already familiar, he finds it easy to identify. Aside 
from sentences definitely framed to utilize rhyme in learning to 
read, many Mother Goose jingles are especially valuable 
because of their well matched rhymes. Some teachers are} 
ingenious in assisting hesitating pupils by suggesting “Tha’ 
word rhymes with -” Such rhyming games and task: 
as the following may be profitably employed:

(1) Pupils write all the words they can think of whic 
rhyme with other words given; e.g., go, red, can, late, find. 
(2) A guessing game, “I am thinking of a word that rhyme: 
with day. What is it?” 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
  
The Teaching of Reading and Literature 115 
“I am thinking of a word that rhymes with ink and means 
a color; what is it?” 
(3) Pupils perform such tasks as the following: 
      
                                    
    
   Find a word on this page which rhymes with hoop. 
Find two words on this page which rhyme with nod. 
Find all the words in the lesson which rhyme with set. 
Providing reading content—textbooks. 1. Charts. Not long 
ago most pupils began their reading experience with the chart, 
from which they were promoted into the primer. Charts 
are much less used than formerly, the blackboard taking their 
place. Even when well devised, they proved unsatisfactory; 
print, vocabulary, and method were often at variance with 
reading books in use; even if originally not objectionable, 
books were often changed several times during the life of 
the chart, leaving it a discordant element of primary method. 
Simple but very useful phonic charts are now published to 
accompany many primers. These and equally satisfactory 
charts made from day to day by teacher and class upon black- 
board or paper sheets accomplish more than the old reading 
charts ever could. 
2. Primers. Beginning as simplified selections from the 
Bible, later illustrated, the primer of to-day is scientifically 
imade up, beautifully illustrated, and brought to great me- 
chanical perfection. As many out-of-date books are still 
sed, and as expert primary teachers differ as to what they 
emand in primary reading books, an outline for study and 
iticism of primers is given. It is evident that attention to 
echanical details is of more importance here than in 
lealing with books for higher grades. (See exercise 14, 
age 150.) 
3. Readers for the lower grades. Such books contain many 
hort selections and extracts from literary masterpieces. 
hey devote considerable attention to lesson helps, lists of
-P-A-G-E-124
  116 The Technique of Teaching 
new or difficult words, definitions, and study questions. 
They are the type of reader quite generally used during most 
of the nineteenth century in this country. The selection of 
this kind of reading book presents a difficult problem when 
several sets are used for supplementary purposes, as is now 
the practice in most well equipped schools, since a large 
portion of content may be repeated several times. This, 
rather than mechanical execution, lesson helps, or arrange- 
ment, must receive major consideration above the second 
grade. 
4. Classics. One or a few literary selections by the same 
author usually constitute the content of a reading “classic.” 
Presentation of larger units of literature is more satisfactory 
to all concerned than the use of detached extracts. There is 
always a motivation advantage in giving to pupils a new 
book; classics are “new” many times as often as readers can 
well be. With classics, supplementary reading may be pro- 
vided with no overlapping; no one need purchase an entire} 
bound volume in order to secure a few dozen pages of desired} 
material encumbered with a few hundred of unsuitable con: 
tent. Classics are available at reasonable prices, and it i 
possible to enrich the reading course with new or especiall 
appropriate selections, even though these are not on th 
adopted or required lists. 
5. Literary readers.. With increased demand for supple 
mentary reading the older readers often proved too scrappy 
they gave few literary wholes and none of considerable length 
Some selections too fine to be omitted from the pupil’s literar 
experience are by authors who have written but a few stanza: 
or lines suitable for children and so do not find their wa 
into the usual type of “classic.” The literary reader solve; 
this problem by combining several literary wholes, long an 
short, suitable to a certain grade or age. In the interest o 
economy it is cheaper to bind together several selection    
   
                       
      
    
   
      
-P-A-G-E-125
  The Teaching of Reading and Literature 117 
than to issue separately the several classics, and a bound 
book invites better care than one in paper cover. Selecting 
literary readers for supplementary reading presents the “over- 
lapping content” difficulty which has been noted. 
6. Current school papers or magazines. The idea is occasion- 
ally advanced that reading in the upper half of the elementary 
school should be based upon a periodical school paper; by 
this means it should be possible to keep classes reading about 
events of the day. The conception is not new; such papers 
were published in this country before the middle of the 
nineteenth century. Several city school boards were supply- 
ing their schools with thousands of copies of such publica- 
tions a few decades ago. Troubles with contracts and ad- 
vertising, and the fact that papers were too cheap to make 
satisfactory content possible prevented success of the plan. 
Most school papers now published are too cheap, and the 
periodical for general use as a rule is too difficult for grade 
chool work. Under present conditions the school periodical 
should not depend upon advertising for support; only an 
ndowed publisher could long maintain a suitable high class 
aper at the price school authorities are able to pay. The 
lan has much to recommend it and may sometime be made 
ffective. Meanwhile every alert teacher of reading is con- 
tantly on the lookout for current material which can be used. 
n spite of all obstacles a great amount of such content is 
vailable. 
Silent and oral reading. Silent and oral reading are related 
nd auxiliary rather than opposed activities. Each is rein- 
rced by the other. The silent reading pupil may be going 
rough the motions of oral speech by moving vocal organs; 
le may seem to hear what he reads “somewhere up in his 
lead,” as one pupil expressed it. One who has learned to read 
ell orally is also able to read silently; on the other hand,

what he has read. Several of the silent reading tests now 
on the market are excellent devices to stimulate interest, 
apart from their measurement value. 
2. Oral reading suggestions. a. Position of the reader. 
The reader should stand clear and erect; the incurable pro- 
pensity of nearly all children to lean upon some support is 
one reason for having each go to the front of the class when 
he reads—away from all desks and supports. The military 
“attention” position represents an ideal, unless the selection 
to be read is very long. The book is properly held straight 
before the eyes, with the reader looking slightly downward, 
so that the face is not obscured from the audience. The book 
may be held in one hand, changing easily from one to the 
other, or both hands may be used in exercises of some 
length. Pupils may be taught how to keep the book open by 
means of two fingers of the hand which holds the book. The 
weight of the body may be shifted easily and naturally from 
one foot to the other when change of posture is needed. 
Gripping, and awkward positions of primary children are 
natural accompaniments of diffusion—working too hard at 
a single activity before the habit stage is reached; these will 
usually disappear of their own accord. If they persist too 
long, kindly or humorous suggestions as to the necessity of 
so much hard work in holding a book will hasten their 
being given up. 
b. Understanding is the foundation of expression. Oral 
expression depends upon comprehension of what is read; 
what is not understood should never be read aloud. The 
degree to which pupils fail to recognize meanings is humor- 
ously but forcibly brought home in snatches of familiar songs 
e hear them singing—“Three cheers father died white and 
blue” or in such attempt as that of the high school pupil 
sked to use a derivative of human in a sentence and who 
romptly gave “Human, humidity—Humidity with all its fears

    120 The Technique of Teaching 
is hanging breathless on thy fate.” “Whereas, the blind man” 
and “Moreover, the dog” puzzled an earlier generation where 
lessons were taken from the Bible, children assuming that 
moreover and whereas were proper names. 
Every observant teacher can find wrong or inadequate 
notions which pupils are constantly getting from their read- 
ing. Stated differently, these false conceptions are the con- 
tents of the child’s mind which he projects into his reading 
at the wrong time. Economic procedure in securing proper 
expression demands acquaintance with the pupil’s mental 
content, so as to anticipate meanings he is likely to ac- 
quire. 
It is demanded with reason that expression shall be honest, 
sincere, spontaneous. None of these are attainable if the 
child depends upon imitation entirely, or if the selection he 
is reading carries sentiments or experiences too mature for 
the reader’s comprehension. The form which expression takes 
is however a conventional matter dependent upon imitation. 
Doubt could be expressed as well by falling as by rising in- 
flection if such were the custom; emphasis by lowering tone 
would be effective if this were the device of common usage, 
The fact that only imitation can follow conventional form: 
of expression indicates the importance of placing prope 
examples of oral reading before pupils. 
3. Elements of expression. While expression in reading i 
a complex process it may to some extent be analyzed. Th 
teacher must not only know that the expression is good or a 
fault, but must be able to indicate the particulars. Some im. 
portant phases of expression, which in turn will receive con: 
sideration, are the following: 
Emphasis—by force, loudness, time, or tone. 
Grouping or phrasing—fluency. 
Inflection. 
Articulation and enunciation. 
     
     
   
   
          
     
      
   
   
-P-A-G-E-129
       
   
               
     
  The Teaching of Reading and Literature 121 
a. Emphasis is a device for making prominent new or im- 
portant ideas. The main idea which is in every sentence or 
clause, pupils may early be taught to look for. The sug- 
gestions which follow indicate plans for making pupils properly 
conscious of the purpose and value of emphasis. 
(1) In the study period underline the important or empha- 
sized words in the reading lesson. 
(2) Write upon the blackboard a series of repetitions of 
the same sentence made to convey different thought by 
means of emphasis shown by underlined words; e. g., 
Iam ready to go. (We are not) 
I am ready to go. (There is no doubt about it; why doubt?) 
lam ready to go. (Not just getting ready) 
I am ready to go. (Not merely to begin preparation)         By questioning each emphasis may be brought out; e. g., 
Who is ready? What are you ready to do? 
(3) Emphasis by change of rate is easily illustrated in close 
connection with the thought of what is read, as in 
        
  Slowly and sadly we laid him down. (Slow)     Merrily, merrily roll along. 
Merrily, merrily goes our boat. 
       (Fast)     
   (4) Emphasis by change of tone in 
The kettle said, “Hum, hum, hum-m-m-m.” 
“Chirp, chirp, chirp,” said the cricket. 
      
  Selections chosen to illustrate emphasis should be strongly 
dramatic or capable of an exaggerated stress without confus- 
ing meaning or ruining expression. 
b. Grouping is required to make the sentence more than a 
tring of words ending in a peculiar inflection. It is deter- 
ined principally by meaning but to some extent by the 
      
             
-P-A-G-E-130
  122 The Technique of Teaching 
nature of words as to their fusion. It conforms to habit and 
is of necessity poor in the case of too objective readers or 
of those who fail to understand what they read. The pupil 
who reads, “Sailing on, the high peak of a steep mountain 
was seen from which smoke issued” — the italicized portion 
as one group — evidently does so because he fails to get the 
meaning intended. 
Verse often prevents proper grouping because of the feeling 
on the part of most pupils that they must pause at the end 
of each line: 
Ay, tear her tattered ensign down! 
Long has it waved on high, 
And many an eye has danced to see 
That banner in the sky. 
The grouping, indicated by italics, is about what many 
pupils would give. A better grouping of the last two lines, 
impossible if the poetic line is to form a unit is: “And many an 
eye has danced to see that banner in the sky. | 
Occasionally personal word groupings are carried over 
from conversation habits to the pupil’s reading. The pupil 
who habitually and frequently speaks of “making a get- 
away” is very likely to read, “He allowed the little fish to get 
away from the hook,” giving the “get away” so much emphasis 
that it carries over into the next phrase or group. 
In helping pupils to proper grouping, dependence must be 
placed mainly upon conversational expression, comprehension 
being a prime requisite. Children may be made conscious 
of what is meant by grouping, through hearing the teacher 
tead passages in which the grouping is wrong. Expressive 
readers are of course not more conscious of their grouping 
than of pronunciation, articulation, or emphasis; but minor 
directions may be given more effectively if pupils know what 
is meant by grouping.
-P-A-G-E-131
  The Teaching of Reading and Literature 123 
Pupils may be shown that only one emphatic word is found 
in each group. Devote one or more study periods to having 
them underline in old reading books the groupings in several 
paragraphs. Such work should be checked and compared 
both for the grouping and for the emphatic word in each 
group. Economy and device interest are served if grouping 
is indicated by a single line and the emphatic word by a double 
line. It is recognized in this as in all grouping exercises, that 
correct phrasing is somewhat a matter of individual preference, 
not all need group alike nor secure exactly the same meaning 
or effect. 
Punctuation relates directly to thought and may in case of 
the comma, period, and other commonly used marks roughly 
call for grouping; on the other hand, between many groups 
are breaks not indicated by punctuation of any kind. Meaning 
must be depended upon for grouping. 
c. Inflection and pitch. Inflection—rising, falling, cir- 
cumflex — is used to show motive, as well as emphasis. Pitch 
also shows the intensity of force. Rising and falling inflections 
are likely to occur after the verbal idea or at the close of the 
sentence. Circumflex inflection is often employed in con- 
nection with some word which hints at a possible double 
interpretation, as in irony. Examples are given. 
You are in favor of it aren't you? (Falling, rising) 
You area prize winner, you are: Look at thait 
And Surely Brutus is an honorable man. 
Banished? What's banished but set free? 
The suggestions following relate more specifically to in- 
flection and pitch, though these cannot be isolated from ex- 
pression as a whole. 
For pitch or inflection, the best ideal is to cause the reader 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  124 The Technique of Teaching 
to place himself in the situation of the author of what he is 
reading. Better than to repeat insistently “Let your voice 
fall,” “Let your voice rise,” or “After a sentence which ends 
with a period, the voice should fall,” are such suggestions as 
“Don’t read it; just say it.” 
“Do you think he really meant what he said? If he 
did, would he say it the way you read it?” 
“Was he talking seriously or was he making fun of some 
one? How do you say a thing if you are in fun or wish to 
make fun of the notion you have expressed?” 
A very serious fault in which pupils sometimes habituate 
themselves is that of closing nearly all sentences with a rising 
inflection. The habit often begins with small children who 
are allowed to read material with which they are not thor- 
oughly familiar. The pupil reads “I see a white? bird,” paus- 
ing at the doubtful word, and with pleading expression and 
rising inflection asks the teacher for aid. It is not always 
wise to refuse help in such cases, but effective word drill 
upon what is to be read greatly reduces occasion for such 
signs of distress. The pupil who has once formed the “rising 
inflection habit” may receive by way of good-natured sugges- 
tions, persistent help in overcoming this very serious fault. 
Imitation of the teacher’s positive inflections, questions as 
to whether he is asking or telling, a query as to whether he 
has finished or intends to go on, and other little expedients| 
devised to meet the situation, if consistently, relentlessly, 
but not naggingly used, will suffice to turn many negativ 
readers and speakers into positive and more convincin, 
habits of expression. 
d. Articulation and enunciation. Articulation has to d 
with the clear forming of consonant sounds. Enunciatio: 
is commonly used to indicate manner of articulation. Curren: 
standards of articulation are not very high— anything si 
generally used as speech is not likely to maintain high stand.

The Teaching of Reading and Literature 125 
ards. One who wishes for a few moments to play the student 
of articulation can spend a profitable half hour copying as 
nearly as possible the exact sounds uttered in a conversation 
carried on by persons unconscious of the fact that it is being 
“checked, conned, and set down by rote.” A very fair sample 
is the following which, taken as cultured people often say it, 
         
   
     
      
    
    
        
       As a rule a man’s a fool; 
When it’s hot he wants it cool; 
And when it’s cool he wants it hot; 
Always wanting what is not 
becomes 
Aza rula manza fool 
Whennits hotie wantsit cool; 
An dwenits coolie wantsitot, 
Always wanting whattiz not. 
While most articulation is not very clear, use determines 
the standard rather than distinct utterance of every sound. 
Only affectation results from an effort to make every possible 
sound stand out. In such expressions as put on your hat and 
ut back the books, puton your hat and a slight elision of the ¢ 
in put back are better form than giving final ¢ the full force 
fit receives in tick or attract. Sounds become conspicuous when 
ttempt is made to make them perfectly clear. Slurrings and 
lisions are a matter of recognized form in French and are 
uite as real in English though we have as yet not given them 
efinite recognition. Generally speaking conspicuous ar- 
iculation is bad articulation. 
(1) Causes of faulty articulation 
(a) Imitation. Pupils pronounce and articulate as their 
rents and neighbors do. The foreign child encounters 
ifficulty not only because he finds habit and social pressure 
f the home hard to combat, but because his vocal organs 
‘ve formed pathways which are not easily changed. The
-P-A-G-E-134
  126 The Technique of Teaching | 
little foreigner who says songk (song) or longk (long) is reason- 
ably sure to say goingkunder for going under. | 
(b) Haste. Some of the common combinations of words 
are more quickly and easily said if slurred; such are cantchoo, 
dontchoo, thattle-doo, drinkin. The same haste gave the original 
incorrect model for imitation. 
(c) Physical defects. A general nervous condition, bk 
over-anxious temperament, adenoids or anemia are pre- 
disposing causes of a. peculiar hesitating type of ineffective 
articulation. Vocal organs seem to lapse or be afraid to strike 
sounds positively. | 
(d) Specific difficulty of combinations. Th, gr, sh, tr, br, 
bl are well-known causes of articulation troubles. “ 
syllables in words like laboratory, representative, or literature 
(labratory, repisentative, lititure) are related pronunciation 
difficulties. 
(2) Remedial measures. | 
(a) Secure clear and correct images; be sure the correct 
sound is heard. “My country tissuf thee” and “Halleluyeramen” 
are examples of song phrases which children have never dif- 
ferentiated clearly. | 
(b) Lists for drill. Many of the faults of articulation are 
sufficiently common to make concert drills profitable and 
these add a touch of life and variety to school exercises. The 
usual precautions concerning concert exercises need to be 
kept in mind; pupils most in need are likely to take little 
part or a timid share of what is preéminently their exercise. 
(c) Individual lists and drills are always needed to reach 
special cases. Each pupil may gradually be led to know which 
combinations cause him most trouble. A degree of articula- 
tion consciousness is worth while: it is the beginning of build- 
ing right ideals and habits. The reader who started with 
the best possible articulation based upon imitation would 
never become a refined and distinct speaker without a well 
| 
|
-P-A-G-E-135
  The Teaching of Reading and Literature i27 
developed ideal of the kind of articulation he was endeavoring 
to attain. 
(d) Selected exercises for articulation drills (tongue twist- 
ers). Many of these have been worked out. They possess 
an element of play since they appeal to imitative, expressive, 
and rivalry instincts. In a sense, they “feel good” to the child’s 
vocal organs; each likes to excel others in saying the exercises 
as fast and clearly as he can; it is “fun” to catch parents and 
older brothers and sisters. Such exercises often achieve their 
greatest value when given to pupils casually as playthings. 
The teacher may select with design; pupils are as effectually 
developing their articulation even though they have never 
heard of it and are merely enjoying a peculiar play. From 
the first grade to the eighth such drills are profitable and 
will be appreciated. The more clever or witty they are, the 
better the fun. Usually each exercise stresses one or a few 
combinations. For example, the pupil who reads runnin’, 
goin’, sewin’, fallin’, could with profit read and memorize 
parts of Southey’s “How the Water Comes Down at Lodore.” 
The emphasized combination or letter sound is indicated in 
each of the following. The wise teacher of reading can afford 
to keep a clipping collection of such exercises if he does not 
have a book upon the subject — a book is not really needed 
very badly by most teachers.

Articulation drills need to be specific. The tongue twister 
examples just given are specific, though the pupil does not 
usually need to know what he is endeavoring to develop or 
correct. The teacher on the other hand may find it profitable 
to make a study of the peculiarities of labials, dentals, palatals, 
nasals, and liquids in relation to articulation traits of each 
pupil. 
e. Schoolroom expression. The perfunctoriness of some 
schoolroom reading situations is avoided by having pupils read 
what others care to hear. Thorough preparation and responsi- 
ble expression results when class and teacher are depending 
upon the reader for the story. If all are reading from the same 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
The Teaching of Reading and Literature 129 
page let books be closed for better listening. If voice is not loud 
enough ask the pupil to make those at the other side of the 
room hear; if expression is wrong, inquire of some member 
of the class what the passage just read meant. Playing a 
part as in dialogue, conversation, or other dramatization is 
all but a guarantee of vigorous expression. 
f. Schoolroom obstacles to expression. (1) Schoolroom tones 
or monotones are often characteristic of pupils who on the 
playground express themselves naturally. Bad example 
is responsible for some of these cases. Nervousness of the 
class situation may result in a high, strained tone. Any 
measure which relieves embarrassment helps; interrupting a 
pupil who reads in a stilted tone, asking him to “tell what the 
book says,” will lower tension and secure conversational tone 
in his answer. 
(2) The book sometimes becomes an obstacle. Reading 
practice upon conversational material is the shortest road 
to freeing pupils from this difficulty. Another means suggested 
is to have pupils read stories and other compositions written 
by themselves — make their own reading books. When care 
is taken to have writing legible, this plan is helpful. 
(3) Sing-song reading of rhythmic poetry or prose occa- 
sionally causes or rather constitutes poor expression. The 
advice, said to have been given by Caesar, is hard to improve 
— “If you are reading, why do you sing, but if you are sing- 
ing, why not sing better?” Supplying oral reading models to 
imitate, pointing out words to be emphasized, and asking 
pupils to repeat to the teacher or a member of the class will 
help to break the exaggerated swing of rhythm. 3 
(4) It should be evident that the worst obstacle to ex- 
pression is failure to achieve absolute mastery of the mechanics 
of the printed page before trying to read aloud. No expression 
is possible to a pupil who is constantly in doubt about the 
pronunciation of some next word. Trying to bring expression
-P-A-G-E-138
  130 The Technique of Teaching 
from a class unfamiliar with the vocabulary used in the lesson 
is idle waste. 
(5) A last though not small obstacle is the lack of an 
adequate ideal of expression by pupils. The reading of parents 
is often monotonous and its expression execrable; many pupils 
have hardly heard any good reading outside of school and 
some unfortunately hear little in their classrooms. While 
pupils should learn to express themselves, one of the surest 
means of bringing this about is to furnish them abundant 
opportunity of hearing good models: the teacher may read 
aloud to pupils in the reading class, sometimes reading through 
entire selections, read during opening exercises, and in other 
than the reading classes. Fine expression will not be fostered 
effectually unless it is also demanded in all school exercises, 
where reading or talking take place.

  The reading lesson. 1. Assignment. In common with all 
lesson assignments, the proper amount and quality of material 
must be accurately determined. As in other subjects, trouble- 
some problems may generally be provided for in class dis- 
cussion, individual obstacles being cared for individually. 
A typical difficulty is the word which the pupil is unable to 
recognize at sight or to puzzle out phonically. The only way to 
avoid waste is to make word drills thorough in lower grades, 
and the dictionary a habitual aid in more advanced grades. 
Study questions may be considered part of the assignment. 
These are sometimes made to waste the pupil’s time by re- 
quiring him to do unprofitable tasks — memorizing material
-P-A-G-E-139
» The Teaching of Reading and Literature 131 
not worth learning, copying lessons mechanically, or looking 
up lists of definitions immediately forgotten. If study ques- 
tions are not discriminately formulated, the pupil may better 
be left to his own guidance, even though he spends part of 
his time making spool tops or toy airships. Lesson helps may 
be placed on the blackboard or mimeographed; it is not safe 
to depend upon pupils to find and utilize all the study sug- 
gestions found in many readers unless their attention has been 
specifically directed to these. 
2. Study. Effective use of the study period depends upon 
success of the assignment. Part of the reason why pupils do 
not study is that there seems to be nothing definite provided 
for them to do. “Study your reading lesson until you have it,” 
and “Study your reading the next twenty minutes” leave much 
to be desired from this standpoint. If material is interesting 
and reasonably new the pupil reads it through; he may get 
through a second time, or make it appear that he is reading if 
the teacher’s eye is upon him, but he never feels that he is 
through or that he would be through by any specific measur- 
able effort. After the typical pupil has read the lesson once or 
twice he is satisfied with his own proficiency for he lacks ideals 
of what is required to constitute good reading. If he had such 
ideals, no minor devices would be needed to secure continuance 
at the task; there would also be little occasion for teaching 
such children for they would teach themselves. The following 
study suggestions are offered as means of insuring continued 
effort upon the lesson because of numerous goals set up for 
attainment instead of the more remote “Get the lesson.” 
a.C Have words looked up in the dictionary and definitions 
learned.) Only important words and the words used in worth 
while sentences require such minute and careful study, but 
many others should be learned for the time. Definition learn- 
ing involves skill in dictionary using; lists of words taken from 
lessons should usually be written and studied. 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  132 The Technique of Teaching 
6. Occasionally outlines may be used requiring pupils to 
(1) Find the principal thought in each paragraph. 
(2) Mark the beginning and end of each important topic. 
(3) Underline twice the most important thoughts, ) } once 
those which take second rank. 
(4) Prepare marginal headings and show that these are 
accurately selected. 
(5) State the main thoughts of the lesson in five (or-some 
other number of) sentences. 
‘¢.\ Of a different type are the following for use in primary 
grades: 
(1) Make a list of all new words. 
(2) Make a list of all the people in the story. 
(3) Make a list of words hard to pronounce plainly. 
(4) Make a list of places in the story. 
(5) Make a list of birds, flowers tiées mentioned in the 
lesson. 
(6) Suggest a different title for the story. 
(7) Tell which person in the story you like best and why. 
(8) Compare this story with some other you know. 
al For pupils of the first year sight word stage,) give pages 
from old primers or papers and ask each to mark, by underlining 
or drawing a circle around, all the words he knows. Tell the 
pupil to mark all the examples of and, see, run, for, it, in or 
other designated words. (Many of the sight and phonic devices 
described may be used.) 
Drawing may contribute to the reading study period. To 
insure results, specific suggestions must be made; merely 
saying, “Make drawings to illustrate the story,” presupposes 
more originality than most small pupils possess. The accom- 
panying are of the kind needed in primary grades, though they 
are too numerous for a single story or study period. With 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
  The Teaching of Reading and Literature 133 
the increased independence which we expect to develop in 
upper grades, less definite directions need be given: each may 
find his own related drawing project.

3. The reading lesson—class exercise. a. Reading by para- 
graphs. The common practice of requiring pupils to read aloud 
a prepared lesson, paragraph at a time, while all eyes follow 
intent upon finding errors, might well occupy less time than it 
now receives. It may be varied by having a single pupil read 
the entire selection or the teacher may take turn. The fact 
that the home circle does not conduct its reading in this fashion 
is not proof that such exercises are unsocial; lessons thus con- 
ducted are a necessary part of the school’s specialized way of 
doing its own work. 
Emphatic unfavorable criticism of this method of conducting 
lessons is valid when no other plan is ever used, or when lessons 
are perfunctory or barren of results.\.Work must be carried 
through with snap and vigor;) the retarded or slow reader 
ought not to be allowed to kill the interest of those who read 
ahead and complete an entire lesson while he stumbles through 
the first paragraph. Such pupils are entitled to few oppor- 
tunities of reading to the class until by individual coaching 
they have been more nearly brought up to grade.
-P-A-G-E-142
  134 The Technique of Teaching 
b. Sight reading. Most of the actual reading done in the 
world is sight reading. As a school exercise it may be very 
effective if a few precautions are observed. Sight material 
should be “easy”; otherwise hesitation, stumbling, and incor- 
rect expression because of failure to understand are the results. 
If but a single book is available for an entire class, each is 
responsible for making intelligible what he reads. This the 
average pupil cannot do unless the material is simple — one or 
two grades below the vocabulary level of the class. Intelligent 
anticipation of difficulties and word drill before beginning to 
read are required if sight reading is to have sufficient “go” to 
maintain class interest; what is a sight lesson to pupils must 
have had unusual preparation by the teacher. The one unfor- 
givable pedagogical sin in conducting sight reading is allowing 
it to drag. Keep it going. Until an entire selection has been 
read no corrections need be made except those necessary to 
prevent misunderstandings. 
c. Concert reading. This useful device has been condemned 
largely because of its abuse by unskillful teachers. Objections 
are that it kills individuality of expression, develops a phrasing 
and rate too much determined by the tyranny of the group, 
that a peculiar swing often accompanies reading in concert, 
and that those most in need of practice merely follow passively 
or take no part at all. The usual “no one ever does anything 
like this except in school” is also heard, though responsive 
readings of various kinds contradict the statement occasion- 
ally, and the school certainly has a right to employ a device of 
its own now and then if it serves a legitimate purpose, inde- 
pendent of the fact that the plan is or is not used elsewhere. 
Alert teachers eliminate the faults mentioned and others 
likely to develop in use of concert reading.. Instead of hindering 
individual expression it may develop it;\a timid child who 
knows that appropriate tone is a shout or a whisper often fails, 
to do his best because of his timidity; his voice blended with|
-P-A-G-E-143
The Teaching of Reading and Literature 135 
the chorus of a class he is no longer afraid, and comes out of 
himself. If a few are monopolizing class expression, silence the 
leaders by giving them some other type of work. Pupils on 
the front row, right row, last of the third aisle, whose names 
begin with letters before M, boys, girls, members of this or that 
team may be asked to read while others remain silent. 
d. Correction of errors. Many errors in reading have been 
discussed in previous paragraphs. (See expression, emphasis, 
articulation, rate, grouping.) A few mentioned here are ex- 
ceedingly common and perplexing problems. The first step in 
securing improvement is to(make careful diagnosis of the 
situation.’)When this is done, the remedy is usually indicated. 
Reading is a complex process and the cause of a defect cannot 
always be discovered. The writer knows a seventh grade boy 
who has a peculiarly unfortunate habit of repetition in his 
reading. He has been studied by his intelligent parents, by 
several highly trained teachers, and by experts in the psychol- 
ogy of reading; yet no fruitful hypothesis has been made as to 
the cause of his trouble and no one has been able to secure 
conspicuous improvement even by great expenditure of time. 
The only reasonable conclusion, which it may be seen pos- 
sesses little significance, is that the boy is a little “nervous,” 
and that so much study of his characteristic fault has done 
nothing to lessen the troublesome tension but may have 
increased it. The wise teacher in correcting a _ pupil’s 
mistakes studies him without making conditions worse by in- 
creasing excitement which may be the greatest obstacle. 
(1) Reading too slowly. This may be due to 
(a) the pupil’s being slow by nature, in which case the 
teacher must not expect too much. The ideal of more rapid 
reading may be kept before the slow child but there is little 
use of telling him to “read faster.” 
(b) unfamiliarity with words — require preparation or word 
drill.
-P-A-G-E-144
  136 The Technique of Teaching 
(c) too advanced reading material. This may show itself 
in many new words per page or in too advanced thought. Dis- 
covery of the cause of trouble leads to its removal. 
(2) Reading too fast. This is usually not so much a fault of 
rate as of failure to give expression, which of course requires 
more time than mechanical, monotonous reading. “Slowing 
down” a reader is much better attacked indirectly through ex- 
pression than by directly saying, “Don’t read so fast.” Dra- 
matic and conversational material are best for reducing too 
high speed in oral reading. 
(3) Reading in too low a tone. Timidity in the tenseness of 
the classroom situation causes most cases of this kind, and 
some children seldom make much noise even at home or on the 
playground. Asking a pupil to make himself heard by one 
across the room is a fitting device for low readers. Concert 
drills upon dramatic selections is another aid in raising tone or 
increasing loudness. 
(4) Repeating. This error sometimes takes the form of 
repeating entire sentences; sometimes only a word or two are 
repeated. The former is probably easier to correct. No specific 
suggestions seem to be worthy of making; “Don’t repeat” is not 
very effective. Thorough familiarity with all that is read aloud, 
and occasional exercises in repeating familiar thoroughly un- 
derstood material may usually be depended upon to bring about 
improvement. The habit of repeating, like counting the fingers, 
most pupils gradually outgrow; most of all to be avoided 
is criticism which may lead to increased self-consciousness. 
(5) Mispronouncing words. The commonest cause of 
mispronunciation is imitation. This manifests itself in such 
linguistic paths as foreign speaking children have acquired 
and as a result of wrong position of vocal organs. Overempha- 
sis of phonic methods causes a limited amount of mispronunci- 
ation. Speech impediments in the way of wrongly formed vocal 
organs are met occasionally. Suggestions: 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
The Teaching of Reading and Literature 137 
(a) (Specialize upon a few words which are not pronounced 
correctly.) With some pupils, attempt to correct all errors 
simultaneously leads to discouragement. 
(b) Specialize upon words which are characteristically mis- 
pronounced by the community, or those which because of their 
relation to other words are peculiarly liable to mispronuncia- 
tion. The following represent a list selected by a teacher after 
ee) vexperience. Examination of the entire list shows that 
most of the words are mispronounced because of resembldrice 
to others. 
casualty casual’ity inventory inven’tory 
specialty special’ity discipline discip’line 
lamentable lament’able memorable memo’rable 
superfluous superflu’ous_ formidable _formi’dable 
Of a different type are kep’, vilet, libry, goin’, and drownded. 
Very slow pronunciation to show exactly how the word is 
enunciated, syllabication and pronunciation in word drill, and 
word analysis, beginning in the earlier grades with such simple 
cases as gentle plus man equals gentleman and continuing to the 
reasonably elaborate analysis involving Latin and Greek roots 
with prefixes and suffixes, are all effective devices. Of course 
the dictionary habit should be well developed during the grade 
school experience. (See other suggestions for pronunciation, 
page 45.) ai 
e. Class criticism by pupils. Correction of each other's 
faults has been accused of leading to hard feelings among 
pupils, to deflection of attention from important to minor mat- 
ters while listening, and indirectly to censorious attitudes 
which may be a loss rather than a life-long gain. At its worst 
all these evil results may in a degree follow, but there is value 
enough in this plan to warrant some effort in removing its ob- 
jectionable features. 
(1) Pupil criticism should not be used constantly.  
-P-A-G-E-146
  138 The Technique of Teaching 
(2) Larger phases of reading should be the usual objects 
of criticism. Expression and effect are these rather than pro- 
nunciation or position before a class. 
(3) When minor points are proposed as matters for class 
criticism, specialize upon a few — make drives, and instruct 
pupils for the day to watch only the objects of attention. Thus 
inflection, repeating, or pronunciation might be isolated for 
observation while rate and position were ignored. Satisfactory 
progress being made, the object of a drive should be changed. 
(4) Encourage pupils to make favorable criticism. It re- 
quires less skill and makes less for development to find fault. 
It also takes expert teaching ability to secure wel! thought out 
favorable comments. 
(5) While a pupil is reading allow no interruptions. It is an 
excessively poor example in politeness to interrupt and not less 
bad for the reading habits of the one so disturbed. Objective 
readers gain fluency slowly and nervously if constantly subject 
to and expecting critically intended interruptions. Hardly any 
mistake is so dangerous that it cannot wait until the reader has 
finished. The half audible “aw’s” sometimes called forth from a 
bright class by absurd or painful mistakes of a poor reader do 
much to keep him from improving. Most classes can be 
brought to see that such an audible attitude is not in agreement 
with the spirit of helpfulness which characterizes a well dis- 
posed school group. 
(6) Have several paragraphs or an entire selection read be- 
fore discussion. This not only prevents breaking the thought 
into insignificant segments but tends to place attention upon 
important rather than trivial mistakes; little slips hardly seem 
worth recalling after so many lines have elapsed. Criticism is 
less personal if given after several have read. 
(7) After a pupil has read and before others are permitted 
to find fault or make corrections, let him make a self-criticism,/ 
naming any faults of which he may have become conscious
-P-A-G-E-147
The Teaching of Reading and Literature 139 
and making suggestions as to how he would read the same 
passage again. 
f. “Read again.” Unless there has been enlightening discus- 
sion making it probable that the pupil has reconstructed his 
conception of the passage just read, reading again is a barren 
procedure. Having another pupil read and saying, “Now, you 
see how he reads; try it again” is also likely to yield meager 
results. Repeating one’s own mistakes does harm; more is 
needed to bring real improvement than practically unguided 
auditory observation of another reader. Granted a lesson 
adapted to the needs of those who read and reasonably thor- 
ough preparation, “reading again” is seldom necessary. If it 
is felt that the pupil should repeat a paragraph this may be 
done inconspicuously in review or in an individual lesson. 
“Read that again” with the oft added injunction “more slowly,” 
“pronounce more plainly,” or “read louder” may well disappear 
from the teacher’s vocabulary. Embarrassing the reader and 
boring the listening class are the results of its use. 
Teaching literature. 1. Function of literature. “Literature 
is the lasting expression in words of the meaning of life,” 
“the key to self-revelation.” Its fundamental purpose is related 
to emotions and attitudes which are the larger part of mental 
life but which inevitably involve intellectual and factual ele- 
ments. Literary experience is a whole but, for the pur- 
pose of a better understanding, it may be functionally ana- 
lyzed. 
a. It represents enjoyable acquisition of creative thought. 
b. By putting larger meanings into common experience, the 
trivial or humble are lifted to the plane of those who have had 
adequate emotional and intellectual expression. A glimpse of 
life’s possible grandeur may become the antidote for vulgar-

c. Literature supplies content for leisure hours. Not only 
does one with literary taste find reading a satisfaction but his  
-P-A-G-E-148
  140 The Technique of Teaching 
thought and conversation take on an enhanced value. A 
French writer has said the great purpose of education is to 
make all literary — to substitute literary satisfaction for those 
of immediate sense, to impel the young to the library instead of 
the drink parlor. 
d. Literature becomes a medium for character development 
through analysis and judging of human motives; what we ap- 
preciate, approve or admire, we become; what is disapproved 
or condemned we shun and endeavor not to imitate. In dis- 
covering the vanity or crudeness of Gathergold, the reader 
takes an attitude, forms an ideal, which pictures himself as 
not wishing to be like the miser. The right literary selection 
never portrays evil conduct in an attractive light. 
If literature is to achieve these functions, our teaching must 
create a taste for the work of the masters whose fine expression 
of human life and aspiration take us out of the little work-a- 
day world of ourselves. If the young man waiting a few hours 
for a train seeks a magazine or the library in preference to a 
cheap show or a drink parlor it is because his literary experi- 
ence has been satisfying. So far as immediate taste for litera- 
ture is involved it is better that pupils go joyfully to current 
stories than with kill-joy attitude to a classic. With right 
teaching, however, the child who can enjoy the cheap story 
may be brought to see much more in the classic. 
2. Selection of literary material. To accomplish its 
teaching purpose literature must be selected discreetly. It 
must provide various healthful emotions; it must be the 
embodiment of truth through its thought rather than because 
of its facts. In form it must possess the clearness and force 
we have the right to expect in all that is written, but its dis- 
tinctive literary characteristic is beauty of thought and ex- 
pression. 
No one has received his rightful literary heritage without 
coming into contact with all the essential tributaries of mod-
-P-A-G-E-149
  The Teaching of Reading and Literature 141 
ern English literature. Folk-lore, myths, fairy stories, fables, 
the stories of chivalry, a knowledge of the Bible, and some 
acquaintance with Shakespeare is a reasonable expectation for 
pupils below high school age. Enjoyment of many literary 
types early is the best pledge of the lasting interest which it is 
the school’s business to foster. 
The course of study usually prescribes the general content of 
what is to be taught, but there is always room for the classroom 
teacher to exercise choice. While the world is full of high 
class literature no teacher with proper sense of values will 
permit time to be wasted on what is bad. “Bad” it may really 
be, or merely bad because not adapted to age or grade, or be- 
cause of being the enemy of the best. The teacher who rests 
with a satisfied, “This won’t hurt the children,” when seeking 
outside material for the literature or reading class has a low 
standard; “How will it help? Will it be of greater value than 
any other selection?” are more properly exacting tests. The 
question of interest is merely that of selecting what is adapted 
to the age and experience of pupils. Granting this, an inspiring 
teacher who himself likes a piece of literature can interest 
almost any pupil in it. 
Lesson plans for literature. The lesson plan for teaching a 
unit or classic of literature must be elastic or it becomes bur- 
densome,) In a peculiar degree, developing pupils through liter- 
ature is the aim. Immediate, tangible results it may not be 
possible to discover. Without minimizing the importance of 
such facts as may be essential, it is yet a matter of atmosphere, 
attitude, feeling, and the author’s experience. In our zeal to find 
the specific function of a given classic, the subjective nature of 
literary experience must be remembered. “What did you get 
out of this reading?” is the unasked question rather than 
a statement like “This is what the lesson teaches.” In making 
plans for teaching a literary selection the suggestions on pages 
14 and 19 are generally applicable. Certain commonly em-

142 The Technique of Teaching 
ployed modes of treating literature lessons are commented 
upon here. | 
4. Classroom treatment of classics. a. Study of the author. 
There is usually little motive for study of an author before 
reading his writings; writers’ lives are not essentially inter- 
esting to pupils. To know that a kind old poet was a friend of 
children may be worth while in itself and may even lend a 
faint color to his poems; but, after all, most of literary value is 
detached from its creator. Every incident in an author’s biog- 
raphy must be critically estimated before assuming that it 
increases the meaning of a classic. Minor personalia may be 
mere gossip which even detracts from interest in literary con- 
tent. Especially foolish is it to emphasize small or mean char- 
acteristics of authors. 
6. Historical settings and allusions. Until the upper inter- 
) mediate grades are reached, historical settings merit little 
attention. “That used to be a custom long ago” and the 
teacher’s brief explanation of simple allusions, sometimes put 
in the form of a history story, go far enough. Noting correla- 
tions with other subjects may frequently constitute the most 
enlightening comment. Akin to the pleasure of hearing a fa- 
miliar strain in a less known medley is the pupil’s satisfaction 
in recognizing the meaning of allusions. Looking them up and 
considerable reconstruction of historical background may well 
become a definitely formulated problem for pupils of upper 
grammar grades. The use of even the simple glossaries and 
annotated classics prepared for these grades must be spe- 
cifically taught. Otherwise some will discover such helps at 
once, while others will not find the simplest footnote though 
they stumble over it. 
c. Grammar and etymology in literature. Parsing literature 
makes it words, words, words. Thus dissected the most sub- 
lime classic reveals its linguistic dry bones. Every selection 
submitted to such analysis is one spoiled for its humanizing  
-P-A-G-E-151
  The Teaching of Reading and Literature 143, 
purpose. This is far from saying that no grammatical ques- 
tions should be raised. “Where is the subject of that sen- 
tence?” “Why did the author employ a plural pronoun?” 
“What you just read is an indirect quotation; how would it be 
expressed by the one speaking?” are typical of legitimate ques- 
tions in upper grade work. 
Occasionally the derivation of a word throws light upon 
literary content: especially is this true when time has brought 
changing shades of meaning and the author has employed a 
now rare usage. The teacher whose etymological mind too 
easily trails off after diverting niceties of word study must know 
where to stop. Such linguistic excursions are easily indulged 
in with only negligible literary returns. 
d. Composition in relation to literature. Literature, as one 
of the most intangible of all school subjects, easily lends itself 
to the common practice of overworking written assignments. 
Results of genuine literary experience cannot be weighed, 
measured, or counted. No examination or educational meas- 
urement discovers more than the unimportant factual content 
which accompanies the finer structure of emotional and ideal- 
istic growth. fn desperate endeavor to make literature con- 
form as an examinable subject teachers issue some or all of the 
accompanying directions. 
Tell it in your words. 
Write a (paraphrase) of the second stanza. 
Make an outline of the classic. 
Writé a review of the whole. 
List and classify twenty-five figures of speech. 
Some of these have their place—most of them seldom apply. 
It takes little skill to make pupils produce tangible evidence 
of having complied with such requirements. What the teacher 
must remember is that this does not constitute real literary 
experience; it may even be making such experience impossible. 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  144 The Technique of Teaching 
e. Story structure, plot and characters. After a long selec- 
tion has been read and partly understood, fuller appreciation 
may be gained by a study of necessary and central characters, 
lot and climax of the main story and of subordinate stories. 
comparison with other selections read and an outlook upon 
the literary whole are prerequisite for estimates and criticisms 
children may be led to giv, Stimulating such expression upon 
larger phases reduces the tendency to be hypercritical of in- 
significant details that is characteristic of many reading 
exercises. 
f. Memorizing. As has been indicated, memorizing enlarges 
vocabulary and establishes readiness of speech by reducing 
phrases and word groups to the automatic plane. When well 
enough done to be permanent it insures literary and expres- 
sional standards. Skillful teachers often inspire pupils to under- 
take, as a voluntary project, the memorizing even of long pass- 
ages. “Shall we memorize this?” “What would you like to mem- 
orize?” represent the appeal of such instructors. This type of 
motivation is more likely to be effective in lower than in upper 
grades. With the more business-like and less sentimental 
attitude of the sixth grader it is rare that such hints bring 
results. Older pupils regard memorizing with disfavor because 
it is hard work, but they are quite willing to carry out require- 
ments the reason for which the teacher can readily show by 
taking the lead in memorizing as much as is demanded of 
pupils. Gince the beauty of a selection is likely to depend upon 
the exact expressions employed, memorizing must be accu- 
rately done. Learning the exact words used is not parrot-like 
memorizing, provided those words are understood. Theamount 
of memorizing may properly vary with individual ability of 
pupils. ) As minimum requirements, many courses of study sug- 
gest “two or three poems a year.” More specifically this would 
vary from thirty or forty lines in the first grades to eighty or a 
hundred in the eighth. This does not seem too much, but it is
-P-A-G-E-153
The Teaching of Reading and Literature 145 
more than most schools are doing if permanent results—what 
is remembered during several years—are considered. 
g. Reciting and reading aloud. Granting thorough acquain- 
tance with a literary gem and perfect familiarity with silent 
reading mechanics, there is an added charm and meaning in 
hearing it well read. Form, music, and rhythm are revealed 
only through the ear. For this reason the teacher of literature 
must read forcefully, fearlessly, and without self-consciousness. 
This few can do without special training in public speaking, but 
many could improve if aware that unless they can read ex- 
pertly they are teaching literature indifferently. The public 
dramatist’s standard is not too high, and many young teach- 
ers, now afraid of their own voices, could achieve this level if 
they but realized its imperativeness. Necessity is the mother 
of confidence. 
h. Rhythm in literature. Pupils may early learn that poetry 
is music; they may sense poetic feet without being burdened 
with the terminology of prosody. Teachers need to know a 
great deal more than is presented to pupils; the former needs 
an acquaintance with the structure of poetry; the latter may 
profit by mere recognition of the cadence they feel. 
In English poetry accented syllables are regarded as long, 
unaccented, as short. Pupils above the fifth grade find great 
delight in marking the accented syllables of simple poetry of 
regular meter. To avoid confusion, familiar simple lines should 
be used as in the accompanying example.

146 The Technique of Teaching 
Pupils can easily see that poetry has a rhythmic structure 
which may be isolated. Using the same symbols the rhythm of 
the first stanza of America is

After applying these markings to regular stanzas, those 
with a few irregular feet may be introduced. A device for 
fixing the sense of rhythm and deepening its appreciation is to 
furnish pupils with a couplet of a four line stanza asking them 
to complete it, including of course the rhyme.

EXERCISES 
1. Define reading and show its importance in modern life. Look up the 
derivation of the word in a dictionary. 
2. Word drills. Evaluate each as to its interest-holding qualities. 
a, Word recognition contest. Word cards displayed in row. One from 
each team or side goes to row and carries to his seat every card he recog- 
nizes. After returning to his seat each must name all the words he has 
taken. Pupils record scores and cards are returned, another pair taking 
their turn. The side having the greatest total wins. 
b. Word cards displayed in row. Teacher calls upon pupil to go and get | 
a card and tell its name. If successful, the pupil keeps the card; if not he  
-P-A-G-E-155
    The Teaching of Reading and Literature 147 
puts it back, his turn being gone. Pupils can play this game without the 
teacher. 
c. Teacher or pupil handles word cards. Two are chosen to compete in 
first recognition. The contestant who shouts a word most quickly is given 
the card. At close of contest pupils count cards and applaud the winner. 
d. List of words on the blackboard. Pupil with pointer stands; after 
whispering to the teacher his chosen word he says, “I am thinking about one 
of those words.” He then points to another pupil who guesses, “Is it my?” 
“No it is not my,” pointing to the word. The game continues until the word 
is found, the successful guesser becoming leader. 
e. List of words on the blackboard. While one pupil hides his eyes the 
others, by pointing, agree upon a card. Pupil opens his eyes and points to 
words asking, “Is it Carlo?” “Is it kite?”; pupils reply, “No, it is not 
»” until the word is found when they say, “Yes, it is a 
f. Copy five words on the blackboard, having the same on word cards 
displayed on the ledge. Pupils in turn match them, placing the word card 
under or beside the written word. 
g. Children form a circle, a word card being placed on the floor for each. 
Selected pupils march or run around the circle, stopping at a signal to read 
the word in front of them, The entire circle may revolve; when signal to 
stop is given each reads the word before him. 
3. A reading chart in common use affords an illustration of sacrificing 
utility to logical completeness in the accompanying list of phonograms. 
Note that every vowel is represented in each series. Which of the phono- 
grams might better be omitted?

-ath -eth -ith -oth —uth 
-ald eld -ild -old -uld 
-all -ell -ill -oll -ull 
~ash -esh -ish ~osh -ush 
4. “Reading machines” and mechanical contrivances of various kinds are 
still manufactured in some European countries. They were long ago intro- 
duced into this country, as the accompanying quotation indicates. 
“Some improvements have been introduced in the alphabet 
wheel, alphabet sheet, and sand forms. Wherever sufficiently tried, 
these experiments improve the learners better than any other mode 
known to the standing committee. Besides they do not engross 
the time of the instructor so much as the ancient system. . . . 
The children form a semicircle near the wheel; at the foot of it is 
placed the large printed alphabet and, affixed to the shaft of the 
    
-P-A-G-E-156
  148 The Technique of Teaching 
wheel, is the small printed alphabet, taken from a spelling book. 
One of the children holds the board on which the letters are painted 
and another turns the wheel. The instructor points to the letter 
on the printed sheet, and the pupil is required to name it, and 
afterwards to find the same letter at each of the other places, nam- 
ing the large and small letters.” (From Report of Boston Primary 
School Committee, 1824, J. W. Wightman; Annals of the Boston 
Public School Committee, Boston, 1860.) 
This extract shows that attention to method of teaching primary reading 
has long received consideration in the United States—evidently at least fora 
hundred years. With this in mind, remembering that American educators 
have almost constantly been in Europe studying school affairs during the 
past century, how do you account for the fact that few of the complex 
mechanical devices used to teach reading have been introduced into our 
schools, and that those introduced have seldom survived for a long 
time? 
5. If you were teaching a beginning class in reading, would you prefer 
that parents should teach their children the alphabet? Teach them to read 
(partly) by the alphabet method? Or not to teach them at all in reading? 
6. In teaching a beginning class, some prefer to use print from the first, 
even printing words on the blackboard; some begin with script and gradu- 
ally “slide” into print during the first four or five weeks; still others teach 
the two simultaneously, making their script large and “round,” to some ex- 
tent resembling print. What may be said in favor of each plan? Examine 
several primers to discover what these do with regard to print and 
script. 
7. Spell phonically all the words in five pages of a primer or first reader. 
8. How many sight words should a pupil acquire during the first half of 
his first school year? How many phonograms? List ten phonograms which 
all pupils will probably acquire during the first year. 
g. Discuss the relative merits of eight book and five or six book series 
of school readers. 
a, Psychologically; i.e., the incentive value of new books. 
6. Administratively; i.e., cost. 
to. It has been said that the best reading book for children in the lower 
grades is the one made and illustrated by themselves, to be read by them- 
selves. What are the merits and the defects of this teaching device? 
11. What is the purpose of printing words, as in the following extract 
from a story book for little children? What are the merits and defects as 
indicated in this passage?

  The Teaching of Reading and Literature 149 
Once there was a fair and good Queen, who had a dear lit-tle 
ba-by girl call-ed Snow-drop. This lit-tle child had a skin as 
white as snow, ro-sy lips and cheeks, and dark hair. While she 
was yet but a ti-ny ba-by her mo-ther died. Some time af-ter, the 
King had a new wife, who was ve-ry love-ly but al-so ve-ry vain 
and proud, She did not like a-ny one to look as nice as she did. 
She had a ma-gic look-ing glass or mir-ror. She used to stand be- 
fore it and gaze at her-self, and ask: oo in * Time 
pass-ed, and when lit-tle Snow-drop was sev-en years old, she was 
a ve-ry love-ly child, Bet-ter still, she was as good and gen-tle 
as she was pret-ty. She tri-ed to be lov-ing and kind to all who 
came near her. (Snowdrop and Other Stories; Longmans, Green 
& Co., 1914.) 
12. Primers and first reading books occasionally go to extremes in the 
emphasis of some “method” or device, thereby sacrificing other important 
features. For example, this sentence is used in a book evidently devoted to 
phonics and “word families”: “The fat cat lay on the mat and the rat came 
in.” Another amusing sentence often cited is: “Oh, I see the ox go up.” 
Further examples are, “Will Fannie fill the can at the rill?” and “Can you see 
the rat? It is a fat rat. Does the cat see the rat?” Examine several new 
primers, making note of any such empty or inane sentences employed in 
order to fit some “method.” 
13. Some years ago it was believed that children could learn to read short 
words much more easily and quickly than long words. The accompanying 
is an extract from Robinson Crusoe in words of one syllable, published in 
1895. Point out ways in which it would be improved if a few longer words 
were used. What unfamiliar words are used in order not to depart from the 
monosyllabic plan? What evidence can be given to show that one syllable 
words are or are not more easily read than longer words? 
The next thing now for me to do was to make a chair to sit on, 
and a stand to write and read by, as well as to eat from. These I 
made out of the short boards I had brought on my raft from the 
ship. I could not build much at a time, as I had so few tools. When 
I was in need of a board, I had to cut down a tree and set it on edge 
by me, hew it flat on both sides with my ax, and then rub it 
smooth with my adze, and I could make but one board from a tree. 
When I had wrought out some boards in this way I made some 
large shelves, and put them up all round on the sides of my tent.

You see a little round dot, once in a while as you read. It means 
that you should let your voice fall, as if you were done read-ing, 
and stop while you could say, one, two, three, four. Thus:—

Upon what did this book depend for regulating pauses in reading; upon 
what do teachers now depend? 
16. The following grouping of pupils according to their inabilities in 
reading has been suggested: 
Group A—Those who are lacking in power of word recognition, 
Group B—Those who are lacking in power of comprehension. 
Group C—Those who are lacking in power of convincing word recognition. 
Group D—Those who are lacking in clearness, articulation, pronunciation. 
List the pupils of your room or grade according to these groups. 
17. Choose from the following the mistakes probably made by objective 
and by subjective readers: 
dark woods for lonely forest

18. Suggest changes in books or printing which might make learning to 
read easier. For example, consider the following: 
a. Would reading be easier if mand n, p and g, small c and e were not so 
much alike? 
b. What would you think of arranging first readers like this, 
“T like you, little mouse. 
I like to see you nibble. 
Let me feed you.” 
so that pupils would experience less difficulty in returning to the left end of 
the line? 
c. Have all important words begin with a capital letter, much as was 
done by Carlyle in some of his writings. 
Suggest other changes which would look toward economy in reading. 
Why are such changes slow in coming to pass? 
19. Show by discussion and illustration which psychological processes 
are of greatest importance in learning to read during the first year. 
20. Describe the action of the eyes in reading, including a statement of 
the factors determining speed in reading. 
21. Write paragraphs upon the hygiene of the eyes and the voice in read- 
ing.

22. The subjective and objective reader distinction explained on page 93 
is exemplified in silent reading tests. The accompanying is illustrative. 
My fingers were numb with cold from carrying my skates. My 
breath looked like steam before my face and froze into a thick frost 
on my muffler. My mother saw me coming and called, “Clean off 
your shoes and then come in and get warm.” Which do you think I 
had on my shoes, mud or snow? 
   
    
       
    
          
      
   Notice that the one who really reads the selection—understands it— 
must have experienced snow, numbness, skates, frost, mud. Some of these 
a child who had always lived in a tropical climate would have difficulty in 
turning to account in answering the questions, In the same way children 
from very ignorant homes find it difficult to read because they lack con- 
cepts. Analyze the mental background required to answer the following, 
taken from the same test. 
Suppose that I have a dry sponge which weighs a half pound, 
and a pan of water. The pan and the water weigh three and one- 
half pounds. I soak the sponge in the pan of water and wring it out 
into a pint measure until the measure is full. The pint of water 
weighs a pound, I now put the sponge into the pan of water and 
weigh the pan and its contents. What will the weight be? 
23. Jenkins makes the accompanying suggestions for speed drills; try 
each of them; what others have you used? ; 
a, Reading contest. At signal, open books and begin to read. At next 
signal “Stop!” How many have read one page? Two pages? or how many 
lines have you read? 
b. Pupils may be told to read a given amount and, when through, to stand. 
Record time of each. 
c. At signal, open books. Look for certain expression which may have 
been placed perhaps upon the blackboard. 
d, Let each compete with his own reading record; e. g., compare the 
October rate of each and of the room or class with the May record. 
24. It is not very unusual to find college students who are unable to read 
silently more than a hundred and fifty or two hundred words a minute. 
Would such unfortunately slow readers, either in college or out, be able to

25. A four year old child acquired a sight-reading vocabulary of thirty 
words in as many days, and could read readily all combinations of these in 
such sentences as 
Run, papa, run. 
Run, mamma, run. 
Jump, papa, jump. 
A good little girl cannot cry. 
Can you see the little baby? 
No further attention was paid to the child’s reading; it was found when 
she entered school at the age of six that she could not read a word. Which 
of the following conclusions are you inclined to draw? 
a, Any four-year-old can learn to read. 
b. If reading had received persistent attention, this child would have 
been one year ahead in reading. 
c. Since all had been forgotten, it hardly pays to teach reading to such 
young children. 
d. The child had not forgotten all; she found reading easier because of 
having partly learned. 
26, An overgrown, slovenly lad of sixteen who had dawdled through one 
poor school term after another without really learning to read was finally 
inspired with a faint ambition to become a reader. His energetic and re- 
sourceful teacher, in order to reinforce his still rather languid attitude, 
started him to reading poor fiction of which he read twenty-six volumes 
within a few months. The teacher reasoned that the boy was too mature to 
care for the content of a third reader in which his reading ability entitled 
him to be classified, and that his tastes were too low and coarse to be injured 
by sensational fiction. The boy learned to read quite readily. In what 
degree was the teacher’s course of action justifiable? 
27. Aten year old girl who was an excellent reader always began to cry 
when she attempted to recite or read during a special day exercise or even 
when asked to stand before the class instead of at her own seat. How would 
you explain such a case? How should the teacher deal with it? 
28. McMurry describes a reading lesson based upon a current events 
paper containing fifty-three articles, a few of them very valuable, some not 
so good but quite worthy of attention, and others not worth reading. The 
teacher had the first pupil called upon begin at the top of the first column

discriminating in their newspaper reading? Should pupils be taught to 
“skim” in their reading? Some instructors consider such “skimming” op- 
posed to the ideals of thoroughness which they are striving to inculcate. 
What arguments may be used to show that this is or is not true? 
29. Do you ever read aloud to your pupils? What do they gain from such 
reading? What are the chief faults with your own reading? With the read- 
ing of your pupils? List all the words mispronounced by your pupils during 
a week; how many of them do you occasionally pronounce incorrectly? 
30. Considering effectiveness as well as politeness, which of these forms 
of assignment is preferable?

Select the ten lines you like best and memorize them. 
You may memorize some of this if you like.

Read this over and over until you have learned it by heart. 
Memorize this by reading a stanza at a time until it is learned, then

32. Evaluate each of these devices or class procedures used by teachers 
of reading: 
a, Pronounce as rapidly as possible the words down the edge of the page 
in the second reader. 
6. After reading your lesson over, read it backward. 
c. Copy all the four letter words on the next two pages. 
d, Read the lesson over ten times. 
e. You must always let your voice rise at a question mark and let it fall 
at a period. 
f. At a comma, pause long enough to count one; at a semicolon, long 
enough to count two; at a period, long enough to count four. 
g. After studying your reading lesson, copy it; if you get it done before 
recitation time, copy it again. 
h. Copy all the words in the lesson which have short a in them. 
i. Each pupil reads a sentence, the next taking up the story with the least 
possible break, in much the same way that relay races are conducted, there 
being great interest and more or less division of attention due to looking for 
“periods” at the end of sentences. 
j. To build up the ideal of grouping necessary in reading as opposed to 
the pronouncing of individual words, have pupils underline in old reading 
books or pages cut from them, or even in passages from newspapers, the LAS AN Ss

k. In a fourth grade class reading selection previously assigned for 
Preparation, a pupil selected to conduct the lesson calls the class by rows to 
the front of the room to read. After each row has read, the conductor asks 
the class to pass judgment. How many would give row A a mark of excel-

CHAPTER FOUR 
THE TEACHING OF COMPOSITION AND GRAMMAR 
Peculiar problem of English. Broadly considered, English 
is the fundamental school subject. Reading, spelling, grammar, 
literature, each in a different degree, is dependent upon the 
classroom hours devoted to it. If pupils do not learn to read 
and spell it is fairly reasonable to blame the teachers of these 
subjects. Language, on the other hand, islearned by allwhether 
they go to school or not; correct or incorrect speech depends 
far more upon playground and home environment than upon 
what occurs in the composition period. Without absolving 
from responsibility those who teach composition, it may be 
admitted that most of the ability to have something to say 
and to say it effectively is not developed by them; nor should 
they exclusively be censured for lack of positive results. To 
think straight, to organize, to be interesting, or to be mentally 
significant are not capacities brought to pass in the composition 
class, nor is it just or profitable to complain of instruction 
in this subject if pupils are incoherent, hazy, slipshod, or 
lazy. Many of them will be all of these and have other un- 
desirable mental traits, unless all teachers all of the time 
consider themselves responsible most fundamentally for pupils’ 
linguistic development. 
The meaning of composition. In this discussion, the term 
composition is used to include both oral and written work. 
We hear of “written language lessons” and of “oral composition.” 
There seems to be no valid reason for employing both phrases. 
“Composition” more nearly represents what is really done; com- 
bining or organizing into coherent expression. Composition 
thus represents working more or less effectively with language. 
158

  The Teaching of Composition and Grammar 159 
The function of language. The racial origin and purpose of 
language is to communicate or express. Communication 
occurs when there is a difference of intellectual level. Two 
persons with exactly the same knowledge and experience 
would find communication difficult. The ignorant tramp 
who knows the road is intellectually taller at the moment 
than the college graduate who asks information upon that 
specific subject. If we seek knowledge, we may appropriately 
think of ourselves as short, looking up to the one who knows. 
If we share what we know, we may in an immediate informa- 
tional sense be looking down upon those we are talking to. 
The meaning of communicate or express must be broadly 
conceived. Language, defined functionally, includes much 
which is not directly seeking or giving information. “Pass 
the bread,” “Ouch!” “3x3 = 9,” “How far is it?” “A mile,” 
“Kitty, Kitty, Kitty,” and “O, that this too, too solid flesh 
would melt,” all achieve a purpose. In teaching there is 
everything to gain by keeping language at its racial purpose. 
Children, like the rest of us, prefer telling or communicating 
to repetition of what all know beforehand. 
Vocabulary a measure of intelligence. 1. Origin of words. 
The origin of words has been given at least three explanations, 
all having value for teachers, though of course not adequately 
answering the question of origin. The invention theory holds 
that words are deliberately invented to characterize elements 
of experience. Onomatopoetic words like pellmell, intensifying 
terms like bonbon, and thousands of words which seem in some 
way to resemble what they stand for are the support of this 
theory. It often seems that little children invent new words, 
though intimate acquaintance usually reveals associations 
which account for all but mere babbling. 
| The imitation theory traces all to conscious or semi-con- 
scious attempts at repetition of what is heard. All recognize 
the importance of imitation among pupils, those from some

homes having acquired in this way a superior vocabulary, 
while others exhibit the intellectual poverty of an environ- 
ment which furnishes few or poor models to reproduce. 
The spontaneous utterance theory is illustrated in the case 
of the baby who interjects a meaningless vocal sound which 
fond parents quickly catch and interpret for him. The form 
of such words is largely dependent upon the interpretation 
and the accident imitated. Observing teachers may easily 
discover invention, imitation, and spontaneous utterance in 
the language of small children. Tracing expressions of pupils 
to their origin increases understanding of language problems. 
2. Importance of vocabulary. The academic question of 
whether one’s vocabulary may be larger or smaller than his 
stock of ideas has no pragmatic value so far as teaching is 
concerned; jour intellectual world is as large as its vocabulary. 
Pupils who “know but can’t tell,” do not know; those who “can’t 
find the word for the idea,” have no idea. Word-proud pedants 
are bad, but hesitating word-hunting ignoramuses are more 
numerous. The treasure of a discriminating and ample vocab- 
ulary has not received attention in proportion to its importance. 
3. Growth of vocabulary. The child acquires words as his 
experience needs them. First come single sentence words 
like “Drink” which means “Bring me a drink.” Verbal ideas 
are expressed by gesture, adverbial and adjective ideas by 
gesture and grimace. The copula is long unnecessary, as one 
may note in listening to the “candy good,” “snow cold,” and 
“kitty gone” of little children. Pronouns come into use later; 
they are not so definite as the noun, you, I, he, or them not being 
attached to individuals but shifting with the speaker. They 
are a complex instrument of speech and occupy a large place 
in every study of errors. The early growth of vocabulary is 
illustrated by the accompanying study of the speech of a 
four year old child.

4. Size of vocabulary. The vocabulary used in conversation 
or in writing, and the understood vocabulary are widely 
different. Extreme statements sometimes made by teachers 
impatient of poverty in expression usually refer to written 
vocabulary. The very large numbers given in the accompany- 
ing estimate indicate the total words understood more or less 
accurately. The vocabulary of any pupil may be crudely 
estimated by finding how many words on every tenth or 
twenty-fifth page of a dictionary he recognizes and defines 
or uses properly in a sentence. The average number so recog- 
nized, multiplied by the number of pages, constitutes a fairly 
reliable estimate.

  162 The Technique of Teaching 
of vocabulary connotes growth of experience. Driving the 
word member of the team ahead of the equally important 
stock of ideas can mean only vacuous formality. Experience 
is education; it may come through a liberalizing environment, 
travel, reading, or contact with a great personality; but no 
one can have words without it. 
In addition to this fundamental way of increasing vocabu- 
lary, pupils may be inspired with the conscious purpose of 
learning to use intelligently the serviceable and characteristic 
words employed by the authors they read. Limiting pupils’ 
ideals only to words sure to be needed practically is a foolish 
dwarfing of mental life. Making word collections is as profit- 
able an exercise of the collecting instinct as are other such 
enterprises encouraged by the school. 
Auxiliaries of spoken language. Gesture supplements lan- 
guage in the early learning stage and continues to ,rein- 
force meanings and give emphasis. Postures may be proud, 
weary, comfortable, or servile. The clenched fist means anger, 
a finger on the lips silence, the wrinkled brow perplexity, the 
nod approval. Children say “so high” or “that long,” indicating 
with the hands. These fundamental modes of expression come 
with most children when they enter school. They merit 
study; a list of all gestures made by your pupils is worth 
making in the interest of a fuller understanding of their lan- 
guage problems. Some gestures need to be encouraged; 
others have supplanted words pupils need to know. 
Drawing is an auxiliary of spoken language. The simplest 
narrative or representative drawing comes as naturally to 
some pupils as gesture to others. The pupil who reinforces 
or vivifies his narration by use of crayon or pencil should 
certainly be given fullest freedom to use this, his peculiar 
language. One who cannot draw, or thinks he cannot, should 
be convinced that he can, and that without drawing he will 
frequently find it very hard to represent his idea.

The Teaching of Composition and Grammar 163 
The teaching purpose — to develop expression. 1. To de- 
velop content and organize expression. Pupils entering school 
at the age of six are personal, incoherent, rambling, — childish. 
They must gain and organize experience, so that it may be 
communicated. The primary purpose is to acquire content 
and the ability to express it intelligibly. 
2. To teach mastery of conventional forms. A secondary but 
not less important purpose is to master conventional forms 
of expression. “I brang” is not more liable to be misunder- 
stood than is the correct form. Except upon conventional 
grounds, there is no justification for our expenditure of energy 
in making right use of shall and will. Even careless punctua- 
tion is seldom the cause of as practical a misunderstanding as 
in the case which follows: 
A New York banker had a spendthrift friend, who was constantly running 
out of money and then appealing for help. The banker resolved to lend him 
no more money. A little later a business friend on the Pacific coast tele- 
graphed the New Yorker, “Jim here out of money; shall I lend money for 
ticket home?” Out of patience, the New York man wired, “Don’t; let Jim 
walk.” Jim came into his office the next week and thanked him for the 
money received, because of the telegram delivered, “Don’t let Jim 
walk.” 
3. To develop taste and sense for effects. Composition should 
develop taste and a sense for effects. “An author should say, 
what he is preparing to say, not merely come near it; use the 
right word, not its second cousin.” (Mark Twain.) Taste 
includes politeness and skill in discrimination of fine shades 
of meaning. Words roughly alike come to be felt more accu- 
rately if composition has wrought a good work. The change in 
imagery carried by a single word is illustrated in such exercises 
as “Give me my hat,” said (laughed, whimpered, or growled) 
the boy. The fact, too, that usage changes the effectiveness, 
leven the meaning, of words is not too advanced a conception 
for pupils in upper grades to acquire. They can be made to 
see that awful, swell, nice, good, and fine often have no meaning
-P-A-G-E-172
  
164 The Technique of Teaching 
because of their over-use. Like fair which once had only a 
favorable meaning which it still preserves in fair day but has 
lost in fair reader, or fair musician, many words cheapened 
by use are to be avoided. 
4. To foster ideals of interest and of accuracy of statement. 
Composition has the much harder task of building the ideal 
of being interesting. One may speak or write with formal 
correctness and yet be without humor, be tedious, and addicted 
to platitudes. The “obvious remark” and the “bromide” are 
newspaper names for characteristics of conversation which 
teachers of composition need to combat. “Does this 
say anything, go anywhere, or make any contribution?” 
are tests pupils can early be taught to apply to their own 
efforts. 
Composition in a peculiar degree develops truthfulness. 
Children exaggerate honestly; the minnow is a large fish; 
the hillock a mountain; the house-dog in the dark a huge bear, 
because each is thus seen. Exaggeration is also promoted 
by the intensity of the child’s sense experience; to him it 
is “awful” cold, and he finds no lack of such incorrect models 
for imitation. Experiencing accurately and repeating honestly 
in a form worth hearing is the ideal of composition. 
5. To insure skill in written use of the mother tongue. Com- 
position develops skill in written use of the mother tongue. 
Too great a distinction is made between oral and written 
exercises. The first precedes and shades into the second. 
What we write will probably represent greater accuracy and 
correctness of form than what we say because it has received 
more thought and time, not, however, being essentially dif- 
ferent. “The greatest of all errors in the matter of writing 
is to think, as many do, that we must not write as we talk.” 
“The rule is general and without exception, that what one 
does not say in speaking, one ought not to say in writing.” 
(Vaugelas.) Teachers of composition may well consider the
-P-A-G-E-173
  The Teaching of Composition and Grammar —_165 
rules of the old Frenchman. Pupils almost invariably regard 
written composition as essentially different from oral. 
Ideals of composition teaching. Teaching ideals are nowhere 
more important and harder to state than in composition. 
“Not failure but low aim is crime.” Most teachers themselves 
cannot write a page of attractive, correct English. Because 
there is legitimate variation in usage and competent author- 
ities disagree, some are confused. If a clever or catchy writer 
advocates the use of slang and another justifies swearing, 
there is an immediate reflex among immature teachers without 
expression standards. If an undoubted authority says there 
is no final reason for our not imitating the French “It is me” 
and that in time this will be the recognized form, some one 
is sure to infer that the time has come to encourage third 
grade children in this most natural usage. Most teachers 
can profitably study their procedure by making a serious 
formulation of what they believe. The beginning of such a 
creed is suggested; a full list of ideals can be made only by 
the one whose creed they are. 
Oral language precedes written. 
Every school exercise using language is an exercise in com- 
position. : 
All written work involving thought is composition. 
Only the pupil’s best work is accepted: it is not likely to 
be a finished product, but it must be his best. 
Saying something is as important as correctness. Neither 
interferes with the other and both are essential. 
“IT never use slang, to an interviewer or anybody else.” 
(Mark Twain.) 
Psychology of composition teaching. 1. Imitation and 
habit. The factors of imitation, association, and habit are 
fundamental upon the formal side of composition teaching. 
'The force of environment is against us. The little geography 
or history which pupils acquire, the school gives them; they 
are learning to talk all the time usually from incorrect models.
-P-A-G-E-174
166 The Technique of Teaching 
Even the minority of parents who would aid the school delib- 
erately find the relentless power of habit opposed to their 
effort. Returning from school the child says, “Can I have a 
piece of pie?” “ ‘May I’ you mean.” “Well, may I have a piece 
of pie?” “Yes, you can,” is the dialogue likely to follow. Not 
alone is social environment an unconscious opposing force 
but it is often consciously against improvement. The pupil, 
who has learned that “Whom did you call?” is the proper 
form, feels social pressure against its use. It sounds to him 
and to his companions of playground and home, affected, 
bookish, or “superior.” Subconsciously he seems to be reproving 
the common speech of his group and as a reformer he is un- 
popular. But even here repetition and habit help. A pupil, 
knowing that “It is I” has book and school approval, if given 
opportunity for a few hundred repetitions of the correct. form 
changes his taste. In time he finds that “It is me” no longer 
sounds right. In words as in dress, fashion largely determines 
what is pleasing. 
2. Dynamic intensity of child experience. The dynamic 
force of the child must be reckoned with in accounting for 
language mistakes. Even a pupil who never heard incorrect 
expressions would not speak with invariable correctness. If 
very much disgusted with his course of action he says, “I 
won’t never do it no more,” crowding all possible negation 
into his resolution. “Can’t hardly,” “shouldn’t be but one,” 
“unraveling,” and “return back home” seem stronger than the 
correct expressions. Such exemplifications of spontaneous 
utterance are less serious than the much larger family of 
troubles traceable to imitation, but even these if repeated 
tend to set as habits. 
3. Inconsistency of language itself. The language itself 
is inconsistent. As in spelling by sound analogy, pupil logic 
constantly meets unreasoned obstacles; sing, sang, sung sugges! 
bring, brang, brung; snow, snowed calls for throw, throwed.

call, called invites fall, falled; and of course such confusions 
as lie, lay, and sit, set are inheritances of perpetual effort. 
4. The factor of experience. Upon the content side, necessity 
of keeping close to pupil experience is constant. Uninterest- 
ing or unsuitable composition subjects are usually the result 
of assuming teacher interests or tastes in pupils. It is most 
natural also for young teachers to expect too long and con- 
sistent efforts; pupil experience is not in large units. Asking 
for the thought of a paragraph usually secures greater return 
than if a summary of a page is called for. 
Correction of errors. 1. Habit formation. Applying the 
habit formation law to correction of language mistakes, 
requires that attention be intelligently focalized upon real 
errors. Colloquialisms are not incorrect. “Lots of” and “go 
slow” should not be listed with “like I do” and “he don’t.” 
Elimination of the bad will leave us little time for insignificant 
points which a purist might wish to dwell upon. 
A focalizing device is the speech survey, in which teachers 
and pupils collect characteristic spoken and written errors. 
When these have been classified, it will usually be found that 
the list does not greatly differ from others already published, 
but it gains in motive because of its personal and local origin. 
Better Speech Week posters center attention upon the 
problems. If posters are so devised as to present correct 
forms they may accomplish a specific function. It is doubtful 
pedagogy to display incorrect expressions on posters: such 
negative examples are never rare and need no additional 
publicity. 
2. Graded focalization. Effective focalization upon speech 
errors requires isolation of a few for attention and practice 
in each grade or division of school. Attacking too many at 
once diffuses effort. Errors not on the special list need not 
be utterly neglected, but intensive work upon a small number 
during school years, when their correction has been agreed
-P-A-G-E-176
  168 The Technique of Teaching 
upon, is a guarantee to later teachers of what each pupil has 
at least been exposed to. Most recent courses of study provide 
such grade lists as the one which follows. Mistakes listed for 
correction drill in grades one to three should be rare in the 
intermediate years and never heard in grades seven and eight. 
To say of an error made by a seventh grade pupil “That is a 
third grade mistake,” is an effective application of the black 
list idea. 
Correct Form Drills by Grades 
Grades One, Two, Three. 
I did, I saw, I have seen, I lay, I came, I haven’t any, you 
were, I have gone. 
Grades Four, Five, Six. 
He said, I was, lying down, he doesn’t, an apple, may I, 
with you and me, do as I do, look like me, let it go, he plays 
well, there were three. 
Grades Seven and Eight. 
If I were you, if I had been, I wish he had been, if he should 
come, shall we go? The scenery in these places is beautiful. 
3. Repetition technique. The error discovered, attentive 
repetition in lower grades is brought about through games 
involving use of expressions being worked upon. While such 
games are an indispensable element of teaching technique, 
not all in use are effective or psychologically justifiable. The 
principle of varied device in drill requires acquaintance with 
many expedients and ability to evaluate those so liberally 
provided in educational periodicals. Two or three of the 
typical games noted on page 180 in ten minutes of drill 
are more effective than a single device employed too long. 
Keeping all oral exercises and classroom language upon a 
correct, kindly, polite plane reinforces formal composition 
lessons. No one can afford to allow the devil of slovenly, 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  The Teaching of Composition and Grammar 169 
tedious, incorrect speech to kill the zest of a history or geog- 
raphy class. Requiring so much written work that it cannot 
be kept up to reasonable standards is an actual undoing of 
whatever the composition period accomplishes, since repeated 
bad composition fixes that kind. All required written work 
may be inspected by the busiest of teachers; no more than 
can be supervised should be assigned. 
4. Ideal of self-criticism. Correction of errors is not achieved 
until pupils have the ideal of self-criticism, and a measure of 
technique for making this effective. Pupils who hand in work 
which they could easily improve may be required to rewrite 
occasionally — not too often, demanding much of this pecu- 
liarly unpopular kind of repetition being an admission that 
the plan is having no effect. Pupils may be led to see that 
handing in a carelessly composed lesson is as impolite as 
writing the lesson upon torn, creased, or improperly folded 
paper. The hurry of many schoolrooms makes impossible 
what should be a universal practice — reading over and cor- 
recting written work before it is collected. As a guide to self- 
criticism a systematic outline may be worked out, pupils 
and teacher agreeing upon each point. The accompanying 
is suggestive only; each grade and class can best make its 
own plan. 
OUTLINE FoR SELF-CRITICISM 
a. Are title, margin, and indentation right? 
b. Read the exercise through. 
Are words omitted? Misspelled? Misplaced? 
Which words could as well be left out? 
Which words are particularly apt? 
What new words are used? 
c. Read again, noting sentences. 
Are any too long? Arranged in wrong order? 
Find the best sounding sentences. 
Restate sentences which should be improved, 
Has each a subject and a predicate?
-P-A-G-E-178
  170 The Technique of Teaching 
d, Have you kept to the subject? Put in anything not related or unneces- 
sary? If the composition seems interesting what makes it so? 
e. Does every sentence begin with a capital? End with the right punctua- 
tion? Is every word legible? Is the paper folded squarely? 
Most teachers can arrange to spend at least one period 
a week giving pupils individual help. The high school teacher’s 
device of a theme card may well be employed in upper, inter- 
mediate, and grammar grades. The outline just given may be 
used in conference as well as for individual self-checking. 
Oral and written composition. 1. Oral precedes. Oral com- 
position precedes written. Talking consistently usually assures 
ability to write the same content minus the very important 
mechanics of capitalization and punctuation. Since teachers 
generally are giving oral English greateremphasis than formerly, 
there is less complaint of the written composition period. 
After all, pupils usually lack content rather than correct 
writing manners. Class and blackboard discussion, reading, 
and a field trip will secure results which the bare topic “How 
to Select Seed Corn” can never elicit, even from intelligent 
country children. A real visit to a bank insures content 
where an imaginary trip would fail. 
2. Copying exercises. Copying followed by reproduction 
and writing memorized passages is a rational approach to 
independent composition. The primary pupil accustoms 
himself to punctuation marks and capital letters at first 
merely because they are there to be imitated. Soon he is led 
to discover his errors and omissions; gradually he learns to 
state his own reasons for making corrections. “Copy this 
story, leaving a half inch margin at the left-hand side of the 
paper and drawing the picture” may soon be followed by 
“Write it from memory.” Copying exercises are easily over- 
done; long continued, they lose all educational significance. 
3. Dictation follows copying. Dictation follows copying 
and reproduction, It may be used with cumulative purpose,
-P-A-G-E-179
The Teaching of Composition and Grammar 171 
adding new features but relentlessly holding to those which 
may reasonably be thought of as thoroughly acquired. Capital 
letters at the beginning of each sentence should soon cause no 
trouble; next, make sure of periods and interrogation points. 
Perhaps the apostrophe is next emphasized, followed, after 
much specific drill, by quotation punctuation. Unfamiliar 
words should not be dictated. If they must be used to pre- 
serve a story, spell them for the class. 
In dictating, read entire sentences or clauses. This pre- 
serves meaning and strengthens oral expression through 
imitation of tone and inflection. At first a few pupils may fall 
behind but they will keep up if this is made their recognized 
business, and the plan will prove ultimately more economical 
and effective. Placing on the blackboard punctuation for 
a stanza to be dictated is a device with motive; it may be 
used to isolate and focus attention upon a new element being 
presented, as in the case of the semi-colon so common in 
quatrains: 
A related device consists of writing on the blackboard 
the important or indispensable words of a story, allowing 
pupils to supply what is needed to make connected sentences, 
as in —-———— river rising —---——— family asleep 
dam breaks ————— flood coming —————— dog barks 
master awakes —————— all escape. 
4. Sentence sense. “When I begin a sentence it stands 
entire in consciousness” is a great psychologist’s way of saying 
that the sentence is the unit of expression. The pupil who is 
not sentence sure is the despair of all who think straight. He 
is as incoherent in thought as the monotone is helpless in
-P-A-G-E-180
172 The Technique of Teaching 
music. Lack of sentence sense may manifest itself in the 
series connected by ands; in the too long series without 
punctuation or capitalization; it may be the hopeless case 
of one who is satisfied with subjectless or predicateless at- 
tempts at expression. Focalizing upon the sentence unit in 
both oral and written work by restricting paragraphs to three 
or four sentences during several weeks has been effective 
in bringing the sentence out of chaos. Transposing sentences 
helps as does shortening or expanding statements while 
keeping essential elements in evidence. Occasional queries 
like “What have you said?” “Did you say it or only mention 
it?” may be tellingly directed. 
5. Short compositions. Compositions must be shorter than 
most teachers at first realize. The primary pupil who speaks 
two or three sentences orally is achieving a hard enough task, 
and he will not be able to write more. Finishing the beginnings 
of very short stories after suggestions for their completion 
have been given is a half-copying plan of lengthening com- 
position. This type of work is suggested by the accompanying 
examples. 
Fred and Will went to the woods to gather nuts. They 
carried lunch. 
What did they have to eat? 
How many nuts did they find? 
What did they do with them? 
    
  
Harry fell into the water. It was muddy but not deep. 
Why did he fall in? 
What did he say when he crawled out? 
How did he look when he reached home? 
6. One paragraph composition expanded. The single para- 
graph as a properly arranged group of sentences about the 
same topic is the entire composition at first. By conversation 
and blackboard outline the need of more paragraphs can soon
-P-A-G-E-181
  
The Teaching of Composition and Grammar 173 
be shown. Though “topic sentence” may not be mentioned, 
pupils become aware that each paragraph usually has one 
important statement supported by others related and sub- 
ordinate. Short paragraphs, hardly ever exceeding seven or 
eight sentences, are most likely to result in clear and con- 
nected thought expression. The paragraph ideal may be 
emphasized by simple diagrams in which the principal idea 
is represented by a heavy line. 
7. Pupils made conscious of organization. Now and then 
pupils may unconsciously write consistently, but they need 
also to become conscious of how they organize what they 
compose. The original rough draft is seldom coherent; with 
this first mental inventory jotted down in irregular sequence, 
the work must be gone over to test its organization. Time 
order, emphasis, the single point of view, relevancy, may well 
be formulated into a self-checking scale adapted to class 
and character of work. How to know where a paragraph 
properly begins and ends may be inductively discovered by 
study of carefully written material in readers or other 
books. 
8. Composition content. The prime obstacle of not having 
anything to say may best be overcome by exercise of ingenuity 
in selection of topics. Aside from text and supplementary 
books in school, the widest fields must be searched to keep a 
supply of vitalized subjects. The surest field of story content 
is that of playground, and home activities, in which the child

  174 The Technique of Teaching 
leads his real life. In addition, the following list of general 
sources for composition material, if occasionally referred to, 
may reveal a surprising number of composition subjects which 
may be gleaned from general reading and daily observation.

9. Begin with specific directions. The teacher finds it neces- 
sary to make very specific suggestions in order to secure worth 
while results from many pupils. As fast as initiative and a 
degree of independence are developed, such helps may well 
become more general. The pupil who always has to be told 
what to write cannot be regarded as a successful product of 
composition teaching, but most children need a great many 
assignments like those in column A before they may be 
expected to succeed with such as those in column B.

The function of grammar. The proper conception of the 
purpose of grammar would silence much futile discussion of its 
failure to function in the speech of children. No subject has 
suffered more because of traditional procedure and terminology, 
much of which is an inheritance from the classical languages; 
and surely no other branch ‘has been so crudely done to death 
by unskilled teachers. Analysis of educational practices and 
resulting destructive criticism, quite appropriateamong trained 
teachers, create havoc among the immature and ignorant. 
Knowing nothing about grammar themselves, it is a simple 
matter to justify failures in teaching by saying that the sub- 
ject is useless, since pupils cannot learn it in any case. Even 
better qualified instructors are unduly influenced by this 
volume of negative attack; they seem to apologize for teaching 
the accepted minimum essentials of the subject. It will aid the 
teacher to think through to a clearly defined understanding of 
a few generalizations about grammar. 
Fundamental considerations in teaching grammar. 1. Gram- 
mar is a descriptive science. Experience and knowledge of liter- 
ture reveal well defined modes of expression accepted as 
rrect; they are considered right because conveniently 
nderstood and conventionally approved. Grammatical rules 
re merely the statement of enlightened practice. Those who 
peak well do not use double negatives; “use no double nega- 
ives.” Cultured writers do not employ singular subjects with 
lural verbs; “the predicate must agree with its subject in 
umber.” Clear recognition that grammar reasons are merely   
   
   
                                 
     
    
        
-P-A-G-E-184
  176 The Technique of Teaching 
those of correct practice would certainly suggest the wisdom of 
an inductive approach. “Thou shalt not” carries far greater 
force after the observation, “The models I most care to 
imitate do not,” has been made. 
2. All grammar is formal. Those who declaim against the 
teaching of formal grammar are abusing a word which in edu- 
cation has come to need an exponent. Instead of protesting 
the teaching of formal grammar, they should object to formal 
or lifeless teaching, all too common in this as inother subjects. 
Grammar deals with the forms of expression entirely: it shows 
relation between these forms of thought processes. So long as 
language is correct from habit, grammar is not needed. It 
becomes a guide to correct speech in critical situations in which 
one must decide between two forms or constructions. Constant 
leaning upon grammatical precepts would make limping speak- 
ers or writers; but experience shows that the same critical 
situation encountered a few times and settled by rule soon 
finds itself upon the habit plane, grammar being no longer 
needed. Grammar, like rules of etiquette or public speaking, 
eliminates itself when it has secured correct practice 
long enough to fasten habit. It is thus a guide to correct 
speech. One who uses conspicuously incorrect language is 
often said to be “using bad grammar.” This is certainly 
not true; he is using bad language; grammar he is not using 
at all. 
3. The conception of grammatical function. A third necessary 
conception is that of grammatical function. Teachers whose 
minds tend toward rigid rules are likely to ignore the important 
fact that use determines part of speech. Such teachers confuse 
pupils by explaining that a certain word is “a verb used as a 
noun,” or an “adjective used as an adverb.” An instructor of 
this type asked a seventh grade class for the part of speech of 
all in “Sunk are thy bowers in shapeless ruin all.” A pupil 
hesitated and said, “If you will explain what the sentence
-P-A-G-E-185
  
The Teaching of Composition and Grammar t'77 
means I think I can tell.” “What the sentence means 
makes no difference; what part of speech is all?” was this 
most unskillful teacher’s only reply. Another with the same 
undiscerning mind insisted that kindly in “Lead Kindly 
Light” was an adverb because it ended in -/y. Such statements 
do nothing to inspire in pupils a liking for a subject they almost 
invariably undertake with an expectancy of dislike. 
Suggestions for teaching grammar. 1. Teaching one thing 
at a time. Nowhere is the precept “learn one thing at a time” 
more vitally imperative. This is violated whenever two names 
are given for the same grammatical construction, when 
textbooks of conflicting nomenclature are simultaneously 
in use, or when the eighth grade teacher outlaws terms 
used in the seventh grade. The same principle is violated 
when any teacher trails off after subtleties of infrequent 
occurrence; common usage presents a sufficient number of 
obstacles. 
2. The sentence as the unit. The sentence is the unit. Some 
courses of study seem to begin with study of parts of speech, 
but the majority start with syntax. In fact, while nearly all 
schools postpone the study of technical grammar to the seventh 
or eighth grades, the real beginning is much earlier through 
familiarity with grammatical terms in composition. Instead, 
therefore, of saying that the sentence should be kept first in 
point of time, it may more accurately be considered the funda- 
mental and constant element. 
3. Practical application. The practical utility of grammar 
may be made evident by constant application; skill in relat- 
ing it to composition is a mark of rare teaching art. When cor- 
rect speech consciousness has been aroused, several rules and 
principles may be made of practical consequence. “A pronoun 
must agree with its antecedent in person, number, and gender” 
is an instrument of analysis pupils can use in critical study of 
their own expression in cases of doubt. “The past participle is 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  178 The Technique of Teaching 
used with auxiliary verbs,” “The object of a preposition is in 
the accusative case” are others. 
4. The inductive approach. Grammar principles are best 
approached inductively. In teaching adverb modifiers, the 
eighth grade teacher is not so much presenting new material as 
summarizing what is already, in an unorganized way, more or 
less familiar. A common inductive practice is to place upon the 
blackboard a group of sentences, each containing the elements 
to be studied, in this case adverb modifiers. In class, these are 
pointed out and discussed. In a summary their function or 
definition is stated. Deductive application may consist of 
selecting adverb modifiers in a textbook or writing sentences 
containing such modifiers. So long as this inductive-deductive 
process is deliberately and intelligently conducted, proper 
generalizations are not hard to develop. Whenever the 
inductive step, either in class or as represented by pre- 
vious experience is too much abridged, principles emerge 
as something detached and inapplicable. If the deductive 
application work is not thoroughly done, such principles, 
though faintly summarized, make too little impression to 
have lasting value as instruments for testing or understand- 
ing language. 
5. Definitions developed inductively. Teach definitions of 
grammatical terms after these have been presented inductively. 
Once the content is thoroughly understood so that it can be 
applied, excellent teaching economy is served by memorizing 
definitions. After spontaneous development by teacher and 
pupils, these must be put into perfect form before memorizing. 
Letting each pupil formulate a definition in his own words| 
insures comprehension, provided his words are fraught with 
sensible meaning. When insistence upon correct final defini: 
tion is adhered to, pupils’ definitions usually resemble th 
language of textbooks. After all, the objection to book rule 
is not the fact that they are in a textbook but that they t     
                             
   
               
      
-P-A-G-E-187
The Teaching of Composition and Grammar 179 
often remain there. Though memorized in parrot fashion, they 
are essentially bookish, lacking in the foundation of previous 
acquaintance. 
6. Sentence analysis. a. Avoid involved constructions. Sen- 
tence analysis is profitable only when confined to clear and 
typical models. Even in grades seven and eight it is easy to 
assign sentences whose analysis yields scant return for energy 
expended. No profitable analysis can be made of sentences 
which pupils do not understand, and nothing is gained by 
attempting long or involved constructions. Leonard?‘ cites 
the example of “All the air a solemn stillness holds,” to illus- 
trate the necessity of knowing meanings exactly. Of seventy- 
six persons asked as to the subject of the sentence thirty-nine 
| favored stillness, twenty-six air, and eleven were uncertain. 
Truly pupils are within their right if they insist upon knowing 
what a sentence means before beginning its analysis. 
b. Minute analysis wastes time. Time is wasted in minute 
analysis and parsing after thorough familiarity with simple 
elements renders profit from further repetition improbable, if 
not impossible. To insist that pupils shall continue to say “The 
is an adjective modifier of ” is certainly idle waste; what 
little attention this statement may command from pupil, 
class, or teacher detracts from the value of analysis which 
may be expected to have a specific purpose. Better results 
may be secured by giving attention only to larger elements — 
clauses, subject, predicate, and modifiers of each, focalizing 
always upon what is in some sense new. 
c. Limited value of parsing and diagramming. Intimately 
related to analysis and parsing is the diagramming of sen- 
ttences. This device has been overworked so often that it has 
lost caste educationally. Like other mechanical expedients for 
aking concrete what are essentially abstract relationships, 
he diagram cumbers its victim with useless imagery. Student

  180 The Technique of Teaching 
teachers, brought up under a diagramming régime, answer un- 
hesitatingly that the subject is at the left or “west” of the 
predicate, or that adjectives are under nouns; sometimes they 
are unable to analyze until the diagram has been made. Just 
what relationships the typical diagram shows, it is not easy to 
determine when such unlike ideas as 
to, an. mone)

01 mone, m: 
are represented in the same way. Lastly, many sentences are 
undiagrammable except by a diagram so complex as to 
be unendurable. The most economical and psychologically 
justifiable procedure is limited use of the simplest forms of 
diagrams, applied only to short sentences of undoubted mean- 
ing. 
EXERCISES 
1. In which grades would each of these devices prove most interesting 
and effective? What is the specific purpose of each? 
a. Hiding game. Pupils choose one of their number who is to hide, which 
he does by mentally selecting a hiding place and saying, “I am hid,” all 
without leaving his seat. Others guess his hiding place, being guided by the 
usual “You are warm” or “You are cold.” A rule may be made that all 
guesses must be in complete sentences, as “You are behind the piano.” 
“You are in the coal house.” 
6, Apupil leaves the room. The teacher designates one as Jt, or gives him 
a ball. The one outside returns guessing “Is it you?” answers by pupils 
being “It is not I,” or “It is I,” or the class may say “It is she,” or “It is he.” 
c. Pupils in turn describe a vegetable, animal, object, or place, other 
members of the class making guesses as to what has been described. 
d, Three pupils of unequal height stand. Questions and discussion follow 
as “Who is tallest?” “Is John or Kate taller?” 
e. Pupils “play detective” in finding speech errors. Rows of pupils com- 
pete, scores being posted each week. In case of a language mistake, the one. 
making it may be “held up” by any alert detective.

f. Rhyme exercise. List all the words you can think of which rhyme with 
— (Select three or four; the following are suggestive of rhymes lower grade 
pupils can match.) 
sky feet go hand face 
gold cake bear light ear 
tree rock pink ring red 
blue fish sad sun call 
bell spool draw hat black 
pen book game seed ice 
g. Rhyme exercise. Place on the blackboard a series of verbs which 
thyme; e.g., grew, drew, threw, blew, flew, knew. Then pronounce as in 
oral spelling the following: 
a potato 
a bubble 
a lesson 
a kite 
a ball 
The pupil is to respond at once with the right word as 
I grew it 
I blew it 
Similar verb lists which may be used are: 
bought, fought, thought, caught, taught, brought. 
bind, find, mind, wind. 
bent, lent, rent, sent. 
bend, lend, mend, rend, send, tend, vend. 
back, hack, lack, pack, sack, stack, tack, whack. 
h. Rhyme game. A pupil thinks of a word, tells something of its meaning, 
and gives a word with which it rhymes, as 
“I am thinking of a little animal that lives in a pond. Its name rhymes 
with log. What is it?” 
“I am thinking of the name of the color I like best. Its name rhymes with 
new. What is it?” 
t, Condensing messages into ten word telegrams. Making a series of

plying details or adding incidents.

2. Since the best writing can be done only when thought occupies all the 
mental field, what arguments are there for the position held by some that 
punctuation may occasionally be entirely ignored? 
3. Justify or condemn the following directions given by an English 
supervisor. 
a, Penmanship should not be considered in marking a story. Penman- 
ship marks should be kept separate. 
6, The story should be marked upon its merit as a story. Spelling and 
punctuation should be included so far as the pupil is supposed to know these 
in his grade. 
c. Errors should not be counted and subtracted. If they are, a composi- 
tion suffers in proportion to its length. 
d. Papers should be marked to encourage. Marks should not be scrib- 
bled all over a paper as this is discouraging; all should be small and neat. 
e. Discourage the use of abbreviations and contractions and division of 
words at end of lines. 
4. The lesson was on lie and lay. Pupils recited the principal parts, 
filled correctly the blank sentences in the textbook, and wrote original sen- 
tences illustrating the use of all parts of each verb. A week later a book was 
placed on the desk and the question asked “What have I done with the 
book?” Many answered, “You have lain the book on the table.” “If the 
book has been on the table two hours how would you express it?” Several 
said, “The book has been laying on the table two hours.” To what, if any, 
defect in teaching do you attribute this unsatisfactory result? 
5. What grade would you give to each of these compositions? (Actual

head Wilson’s Calendar.) 
A useful application of Mark Twain’s rule just given may be made with 
reference to good, bad, poor, fine. These words as most pupils employ them 
have no significance, because the real qualities have not beenclearly thought 
out. A story may be poor or bad because it is stupid, dull, tiresome, tedious, 
senseless, uninteresting, coarse, or lifeless; it may be fine or good because 
interesting, charming, clever, instructive, amusing, or fascinating. A bad 
ruler may be unscrupulous, lazy, narrow-minded, or vengeful; a fine sunset. 
gorgeous, brilliant, or golden. After collecting compositions from all your 
pupils mark the four words noted, and ask in class discussion for more 
specific adjectives. 
The most redundantly used adjective is doubtless the definite article 
the. With pupils of an upper grade class go through a set of compositions, 
crossing out the every time it weakens expression by being needlessly used. 
What means may be employed to focalize upon elimination of this she 
habit? 
14. The well-known and habit, by which pupils run from sentence to 
sentence, is due in part to the pupils’ feeling of the broken or abruyxi scund 
if each sentence ends with a pronounced inflection and a pause. What is

the difference between procedure to eliminate superfluous ands in the fourth 
grade and in the eighth? 
15. Estimate the value of each expedient briefly described in the follow- 
ing: 
a. A class selected three composition subjects upon which their teacher 
wrote compositions. When these were handed to the class, corrections were 
made, each composition being placed upon the blackboard for criticism. 
b. Ahigh school teacher called upon tenth grade students for five minute 
talks without any preparation other than what could be made while 
waiting turn in class. 
c. Each pupil was required to write a ‘for sale’’ advertisement for a 
house (or farm) after having visited the house (or farm). 
d. Each pupil was assigned the writing of a ten line local news item after 
study of well written models. 
e. An eighth grade class was given the gospons bility of preparing, edit- 
ing, and proof reading the school paper. 
f. Language cards were posted prominently in each schoolroom showing 
It is I It is he 
It is we It is she 
g. Copy, filling blanks with to, too, or two.

h. Use for dictation : 
A traveler asked a trainman how long the train remained at a station. 
He replied, ‘From two-to-two to two-two; too long, I think.” 
A clever pupil said to his teacher, ‘‘I can say something you can’t write. 
Try this, ‘You are too late to catch the train. There are two (to’s, too’s, 
two’s?) in that sentence.’”

o. Give each of these stories two or more different endings: 
(1) Boy playing hide and seek with his dog Frisk—Boy hid under table 
—laughed when Frisk found him—came out part way but pulled table 
cloth so as to upset pitcher of cream. Frisk innocently began to lap it.

(3) By addition of sensible modifiers expand each of these sentences 
to not less than ten words.

(4) From the following list pick out each group that is not a sentence, 
giving your reason.

g. Paragraphing devices. 
(1) In discussion decide how many paragraphs there are to be. As sen- 
tences are suggested, sort them according to the divisions agreed upon under 
headings; as, I, 2, 3, 4, or in different spaces left upon the blackboard for 
each. 
(2) Dictate sentences of a composition in promiscuous order, pupils to 
rearrange them in paragraphs. 
(3) Select topic sentences or most important sentences in well written 
material from lower grade readers. 
16, What is the educational significance of these quotations from the 
writings of persons who teach composition? 
a. “A lover of flowers is not less successful because he buys a good hoe: a 
knowledge of grammar never ruined literary style.” 
b. “While we train the few who may become literary lights, the most 
troublesome word for seniors is too.” 
c. “No one can successfully teach composition, oral or written, who can- 
not produce such successful composition.” 
d, “We seem to make no progress. Many mistakes in spelling and lan- 
guage common a hundred years ago are still the subject of complaint.” 
e. “Children often lapse into silence because they are afraid of being 
corrected.” 
f. “Learning by the ‘whole method’ may not mean memorizing an entire 
poem asa whole: it may refer to study of a picture, story, or situation as 
a whole.” 
17. Criticise these suggestions placed upon the blackboard for the 
guidance of a composition class during its study period.  
-P-A-G-E-198
  190 The Technique of Teaching 
Do all sentences in a paragraph deal with the same main topic? 
Does each sentence begin with a capital letter? 
Are periods used when needed? 
Are direct quotations properly punctuated ? 
Is every word correctly spelled? 
18. Conducting a school paper is a vital means of teaching composition. 
In large schools frequent issue is possible; in a small school, two or three 
times a year may be all that is practicable. One room, rural schools can 
carry on such undertakings very profitably: The paper may be printed, 
mimeographed, or written. Answer these questions with regard to a school 
paper you know of or are planning to initiate in your school: 
a. Should the editor and other members of the staff be appointed by the 
teacher or elected by the class? 
6. Should active management and contribution be encouraged from those 
most in need of practice or from those most capable of making a live paper? 
c. To what extent would the standard of formal correctness vary with 
the grade or class of the contributor? 
d, What effect upon interest of news items has placing them upon the 
blackboard for class criticism? 
19. Correcting written material is hard, slavish work which no one likes. 
Instead of marking critically all errors, look over pupils’ shoulders as they 
write, then examine the collected compositions, listing all mistakes made by 
several pupils, and embody all these in a composition placed on the board 
for class criticism and discussion. 
20. Choose sides as for a spelling match. From lists of words already on 
the blackboard, the first pupil on side A selects and uses one in a sentence. 
His rival in turn must use the same word as a different part of speech. Fail- 
ure to match causes pupils to be seated, counted out, or captured, according 
to the rules of the game. A suitable list of words for use in intermediate 
grades is presented. Assemble a similar list for grammar grades.

21. What would you do if children, in the unrestrained excitement of 
dramatic interest either in recitation or dramatization, used expressions like 
the following which are chosen from actual schoolroom work? 4

was surprised and said, “My lordy, this is an island.”

any other profession, most of them cannot prepare even a simple news item 
in correct form for publication. The boy who runs the linotype machine,

their manuscripts so that the article may not be a grammatical disgrace 
to the paper.” 
From your experience and observation what evidence can you cite to

24. High school teachers make many complaints about the English of 
entering pupils. They say, among other things that they 
a. Know nothing about grammar. 
b. Have a wretchedly scant vocabulary. 
c. Cannot spell —even simple words of the Ayres list. 
With what per cent of pupils are these complaints justified? 
25. The most comprehensive of speech surveys proves conclusively that 
knowledge of grammar does function in the speech of upper grade children. 
How would you demonstrate that it is a matter of grammar rather than 
mere language habit when pupils write correctly? What evidence have you 
that you or your pupils are conscious of grammatical reasons like 
a, Every sentence must have a subject and a predicate. 
6. The subject must agree with the predicate in number. 
26. Describe: 
a. A quarter (the coin), illustrating with a drawing. 
6. A desk in order or out of order. 
c. Acharacter in a book recently read. 
d, The telegraph as its inventor would have described it just before the 
invention was a proved success. 
Upon what would you depend for-motivation in assigning each of the 
foregoing subjects for description? Formulate other topics which are de- 
pendent upon the same type of interest.

CHAPTER FIVE 
THE TEACHING OF ARITHMETIC 
The function of arithmetic. 1. Utilitarian or directly 
practical. Practical utility is the primary function of arith- 
metic. No hard and fast line can be drawn, however, between 
what we must have and what we consider worth while. Any 
practical values that may be mentioned shade off imperceptibly 
into numerical relations which are very important but not 
necessary in the narrow, practical sense. Historically and 
universally, arithmetic bears the stamp of the shop and of 
trade. If modern textbooks contain examples which are no 
longer practical, it is usually because business practice has 
changed, leaving survivals. Such traditional problems should 
usually be eliminated; they serve very badly any of the legiti- 
mate mathematical purposes noted in the next paragraphs, 
and are often the least interesting material which could be 
devised because limited by outworn conditions. 
The practical value of arithmetic is sometimes greatly 
overrated by parents and school boards. While dealing with 
numbers is part of nearly every type of social situation, it 
is not very often that most of us have genuine practical need 
for much except the fundamental processes and fractions 
with small denominators. It is doubtful whether arithmetic is 
as practical as composition writing and it certainly has not 
the importance of reading; all are essential in a degree, but 
the result of training in language or composition shows itself 
more inevitably than does that of arithmetic. 
2. Remotely practical and cultural. Granting the practical 
necessity of efficiency in computation, a large part of what 
we teach in arithmetic must and can be justified upon the 
193

194 The Technique of Teaching 
ground of its value in enlarging and making comprehensible 
the world which it is the business of education to build for 
each pupil. Practically it is hardly worth while to teach 
billions or even millions. Few of us have real use for either, 
but we like to read of the national debt or the population of 
the country. It seems that many of us are curious about the 
world in which we live, and wish to know a vast number of 
facts which are probably of little direct significance. Interest 
in elections, growth of cities, states, and fortunes, in the com- 
parative numerical strength of nations, races, and religions, 
and in crop and market reports are typical applications of num- 
bers in fields not closely related practically to the needs of more 
than small groups of our population. 
Many of these indirect values are related to our mental 
attitude and so take hold of practical action. Social insight 
into business and political problems as encountered in the 
universal reading of a newspaper age is a result of used arith- 
metic. The mathematics of the grocery bill touches us directly, 
but affects our action no more surely than do mathematical 
facts which arouse sympathy, fear, or distrust. As citizens 
we take attitudes toward expenditure of public money in 
billions of dollars. Though no one has a very intelligent grasp 
of what such sums mean, the voter’s viewpoint is more en- 
lightened if he is able to compare these quantities in relation 
to other greater amounts or the growth of population. The 
non-mathematical thinker reads the crime statistics of a 
great city and declaims about its wickedness, though his own 
village may show a worse record in proportion to its popula- 
tion. The influenza plague, which lists a few thousand cases 
in the city, daunts those who are not alarmed at one tenth 
as many in the home town which is one hundredth as large. 
We are unduly impressed and filled with hope or dismay by 
imposing quantities considered out of proper relation or meas- 
ured by wrong standards. If the subject could be taught so
-P-A-G-E-203
  The Teaching of Arithmetic 195 
as to make this remotely practical value function, arithmetic 
would make us steadier and more rational in our judgments, 
and wiser in bestowing our sympathies, admirations, approvals, 
and disapprovals. 
3. Mental discipline. It has been suggested that if arith- 
metic could be taught so as to yield its best results, causing 
us habitually to see such relations as may be potentially 
vital to our welfare, it would affect our conduct and attitudes 
favorably. The mental discipline of a subject depends largely 
upon the manner in which it is presented, acquired, assimilated; 
but in some ways arithmetic is peculiarly fitted to be the 
teaching instrument of certain desirable traits. Many persons 
believe that it is a subject which trains in exactness, accuracy, 
love of truth, and ability to reason. It is thought to offer 
situations for exercise of positiveness in statement or formula- 
tion of clear-cut conclusions. Modern psychology would 
probably agree that arithmetic lends itself in a peculiar 
degree to development of these qualities; but such results 
are not so much part of the subject as to be the product of 
haphazard methods of teaching or study. Spending time with 
arithmetic is no guarantee of mental discipline. 
a. Accuracy of form and statement. By way of illustration, 
accuracy of observation and statement may be considered. 
In many schoolrooms such inaccurate statements as the 
following are allowed to pass unchallenged : 
a. d. 
4 2/3 = 8/12 2 x $50 = 100 
3 1/2 = 6/12 2x50 = $100 
5 3/4 = 9/12 4 
b. 5/5 = number 
34+4=74+5 = 12x2 = 24 2/5 =e 
(@ 1/5 = 1/2 0f 12 =6 
4ft.x 5 ft. = 20 sq. ft. 5/5 = 5 X 6 = 30
-P-A-G-E-204
  196 The Technique of Teaching 
It is hard to see how accuracy of statement as a habit or 
an ideal can result from such work. Definitions like “The 
minuend is the top number and the subtrahend is the bottom 
number” may serve a useful purpose at times, but the teacher 
who never gets beyond being satisfied with such statements 
is not achieving much progress in accuracy. Whether exactness 
and neatness of form result from the study of arithmetic 
depends likewise upon what ideals of performance are insisted 
upon. The standard which accepted “count the number in 
the multiplyer and the multum and add; then count the places 
in the answer and place the decimal point” was doing nothing 
for accuracy of form or of expression. Permitting numbers to 
be written in irregular columns or diagonally across the page 
when they should be horizontally placed, or in gigantic figures 
alternating capriciously with those so small as to be hardly 
legible is not training in correct form habits. 
b. Mathematical judgment. Mathematical judgment popu- 
larly supposed to be a result of study of arithmetic does not 
develop merely because of the fact that one is taking the 
subject. Such judgment might be expected to show itself 
in ability to size up a new situation, determine exactly what 
is given, what is required, and then to proceed with the 
proper solution of the problem. Permitting nervous or panicky 
pupils to stagger about among all the various processes which 
may come to mind, trying this and that, constantly consulting 
the answer list as a guide to processes which should be driven 
by independent thought, can do nothing toward developing 
mathematical judgment. 
Teaching confined to book work might conceivably foster 
judgment in abstract arithmetic, but this judgment is not 
sure to take hold of the very concrete situations of everyday 
life in which the essential elements of a confusing complex 
are seldom labeled. In the first case, we may have for the 
coal dealer’s problem,
-P-A-G-E-205
  The Teaching of Arithmetic 197 
Given, the cost price, $10 a ton; the amount 525 tons; 
the selling price $12.00 a ton. 
To find, the total gain. 
In actual business, the problem is likely to appear, 
Given, cost price, $10 a ton; the amount — how much 
should I buy at that price? The selling price is now $12.00, 
but will it remain at that until I dispose of the stock? How 
much will be wasted? How much will I lose because of slow 
collections? 
To find, the probable total gain, giving due consideration 
to the factors just mentioned as well as others. 
c. Non-mathematical judgment. Outside of mathematical 
relations, our problem may seem even less connected with 
arithmetic as studied. The pupil who has been trained to 
look closely into what is given and what is required may be 
far from expert in judging what is to be done in solving such 
problems as, 
Given, two honest laborers heatedly discussing politics. 
A well educated bystander discovers that both are wrong in 
their contentions. The workingmen have a considerable degree 
of class consciousness and a distrust of the academic manner 
of speech. The group has as a general idea, “Blessed are the 
peacemakers.” 
To find, whether the bystander should undertake to mediate. 
In general, mathematical judgments are similar to those 
needed in making the necessary decisions of daily life, but 
relevant elements are more easily discovered and put in form 
to be used. If well taught, arithmetical discipline at least 
increases the tendency to weigh and deliberate after analysis 
of all important factors, but at best much of its judgment 
value will not carry over to non-mathematical situations. 
d. Positiveness or certainty is another quality which arith- 
metic is supposed to develop. No other subject offers a field 
for more frequent exercise of this quality, being sure of one’s
-P-A-G-E-206
198 The Technique of Teaching 
  conclusions and willing to defend them. When a pupil has 
solved a problem understandingly and checked his work 
for minor mistakes, he knows it is right; if a fact is 
acquired from a history textbook, he may feel that he knows 
what the book stated but he does not know as in case of the 
arithmetic. In addition to using the customary proofs of 
processes, teachers may well raise doubts about the accuracy 
of work, asking the pupil whether he knows his answer is 
right, is sure of it, and how he knows so well. It is an unusual 
teacher who does not approve a pupil who is ready to argue 
rationally for the correctness of his own work. 
What has been said relative to accuracy, judgment, and 
positiveness, may with slight adaptation be made to hold with 
regard to other disciplinary claims. If the pupil is to gain 
in attentive power it must be because he has given earnest 
concentration to his arithmetic work, and even this does not 
insure growth of attentive power in other fields. Protracted 
effort, centered upon a problem in partial payments, hardly 
guarantees ability to sit through a musical program with 
close attention. If the moral value, love of truth, is gained, 
it is through acquiring the notion of “not who is right, but 
what is true” — certainly not so easily emphasized in any 
other subject as arithmetic. 
4. Recreation value. Like chess and checkers, mathematica 
problems and puzzles possess a strong fascination for many 
minds. Some of the most interesting have served each suc- 
cessive generation for centuries. They have never had practical 
value, their mythical disciplinary function of sharpening 
the wits no one now regards seriously; yet for the person who 
cares for them they may be considered the purest of human 
pleasures since they afford satisfaction without consuming 
anything except the time devoted to their solution. While 
the school could not well require performance of many of these, 
wise teachers may well encourage interest in mathematical

diversions. Counting, solving puzzles, propounding and 
answering catch questions, may add perceptibly to mathe- 
matical experience. The following are of the type included 
as mathematical diversions, others may be found among 
the magic squares listed with the exercises suggested for drill. 
The fact that a pupil finds some of these in almanacs and 
cheap papers, or picks them up from his elders, subtracts 
nothing from their worth. A school or room collection may be 
kept, each pupil being credited with his discoveries in this field. 
a. Typical mathematical recreation exercises. 
(1) Write 225, using each significant digit once. 
(1 + 23 + 45 + 67 + 89) 
(2) Write 37, using five 3’s. 
33 +3 + 3/3 
(3) Write 100, using all the significant digits. 
(74 + 25 + 3/6 + 9/18) 
or 
(95 + 4 + 38/76 + 1/2) 
or 
(91 + 7524 /836) 
(4) A boy was sent to a well with a five quart and a three 
quart measure to secure exactly four quarts of water. How 
did he manage it? 
(5) Place four 5’s in such a way that they exactly equal 
six and one-half. (5 + 5/5 + .5) 
(6) Ifa goose weighs ten pounds and half of its own weight, 
what is its weight? 
(7) What two whole numbers multiplied together equal 7? 
(8) Find the product of 4x5x3x0x4x2x8.

The concrete basis of arithmetic. 1. Recognized in all 
theories of number origin. Number facts rest upon a concrete 
basis; in this all theories agree. There is, for example, the idea
-P-A-G-E-208
  200 The Technique of Teaching 
that all number is a measure of relative magnitudes; this 
conception stresses the relation of one object as two, three, 
or four times as great as another; typical apparatus consists 
of blocks one, two, and four inches in length respectively. 
Another well-known method is built around the idea of 
measurement, itself rather abstractly considered as an end. 
When this system is used in instructing beginners, common 
measures and weights, such as pints, quarts, and pounds are 
manipulated. A third conception of number is that it is a 
measure of adjustment to definite constructive ends. Though 
no consistent system or manual has been devised embodying 
this idea, it would insist that instead of comparing blocks 
in which he has no definite interest, or measuring quarts of 
water and weighing pounds of sand in which he has only a 
manipulating interest, the pupil should set out to make some- 
thing he wants and find necessity for measurement (number) 
in each piece of construction. A fourth conception is that 
number grows out of counting separate well defined units 
as apples, discs, counters on an abacus, or pupils in a class. 
Though all of these theories have value, no one is exclusively 
correct; and those methods or systems based upon only one 
idea gain nothing logically and lose many effective devices. 
All theories recognize the concrete origin of number and in- 
stinctive tendencies of children. Pupils compare, measure 
for the sake of comparing, measure with the view of adjustment 
to definite ends, and all count, apparently for the love of 
counting. Some approach number best through one, and some 
through another, of these concrete tendencies. 
Number may be defined as a way of looking at things for 
the purpose of measuring, comparing, adjusting, or counting. 
We read number into concrete things: we “see-nine the apples” 
just as we “see-red the apples;” the idea of nineness is a mental 
tool which we use to interpret the objective elements of ex- 
perience. Without a concrete basis, the number idea is not
-P-A-G-E-209
  The Teaching of Arithmetic 201 
possible. We cannot measure, compose, adjust, or count 
originally without something tangible to measure, compare, 
adjust, or count. This necessity of concrete beginning cannot 
be too strongly emphasized. 
2. Concrete elements in notation systems. The concrete 
origin of number is shown in notation systems. The figures 
which we so often confuse with numbers are a departure from 
the concreteness of original situations. They are symbols; 
thus 2 2=tesSathe: are less concrete than the four 
fish themselves. Four marks, / / / /, are still less real and 
correspondingly more symbolic, since they bear no resemblance 
to the objects which are being numbered; 4 or four are a 
degree further removed from concreteness. Illustrations of 
concrete elements in our notation systems indicate their origin.

202 The Technique of Teaching 
In each of these systems of notation the “one for one” 
correspondence is evident in the first three or four of the series. 
In the first two it appears again after ten. 
3. Primitive reckoning concrete. Primitive number ideas 
are reflected in concrete ways of expression. The unlettered 
debtor and creditor kept accounts by notching a stick, splitting 
it so that each had half. A more reliable account would be 
difficult to devise, cumbersome though it was, for split sticks 
do not match unless they originally belong together. Calculus 
and calculate recall the day when counting was done by means 
of pebbles (calculi). The Chinese still reckon very accurately 
and quickly by means of bone or ivory counters which slide 
on bamboo rods. Numeration seems to have grown out of 
gesture, the quinary, decimal, and vigesimal scales all being 
derived from the concrete basis of our fingers and toes. Chil- 
dren in school fall back upon the concrete language of their 
fingers when they wish to communicate across the room. 
“How many examples did she say?” “What grade did you 
make?” “I’ll give you ten marbles for that.” In some lan- 
guages the same tendency shows itself in forming plurals; 
“Jama” may be mountain and “jama jama,” mountains; “fulu,” 
hair and “fulufulu,” hairs. 
Such evidences of the concrete stages through which we have 
passed in the evolution of our notation and numeration 
systems are of interest to children, and they may be told 
frequently these stories of the past while learning number 
relations. The abacus, splints, dominoes, grouped or picture 
numbers such as the following: 
  and examples like : : and ++ are 2 or
-P-A-G-E-211
  
The Teaching of Arithmetic 203 
counting pupils in the room, cards in a set, books on a shelf, 
cows in a herd, and the use of other devices and incidental 
opportunities assure a concrete basis which gives counting, 
measuring, and comparing a meaning. The pupil who at first 
finds it necessary in solving his little addition examples to 
make dots and marks, or to count his fingers is within his 
rights in using concrete means. 
4. Concreteness not the goal. But, granting that adequate 
foundation for appreciation of the concrete has been laid, 
the real goal of arithmetic teaching may be stated. It finds 
fulfillment in ability to appreciate concrete relations, lay 
them aside while abstract symbols are considered and used 
as tools, and at will to translate such symbols and their 
relationships into the concrete which stands back of them. 
Paradoxical as it may seem, much of the teacher’s endeavor 
is to save pupils from too much concreteness. It is only the 
lowest mental ability which is unable to shake off the tangible 
in its thinking; the highest order of mentality separates itself 
from the specific and immediately present, while it deals with 
the general and abstract. Concrete thinking may result in 
a one log bridge across a little brook, or bring direct aid to 
a starving beggar; it will not carry heavy trains across rivers, 
nor devise programs of social legislation to make the starving 
beggar unknown. 
The type of mind which is hopelessly tied to the concrete 
is common enough in all fields. The individual who insists 
that all of a given race are dishonest because of the mental 
inertia which carries as the only significant experience a deal 
involving a rascal of that race, and the person, who must 
stand before the clock and trace the hands around the dial, 
in order to compute her wages from two o’clock until four- 
thirty at thirty cents an hour are but examples of the same 
unfortunate inability to free one’s self from concrete situations. 
Illustrations of mentality operating solely upon the low plane  
-P-A-G-E-212
  204 The Technique of Teaching 
of the single instance or the tangible are worthy of analysis; 
they may be amusing, though we usually classify such acts 
as stupid and think of the actor as a fool. 
A teacher sent home the following arithmetic example: “If a boy’s 
father walks west ten blocks, south five blocks, east twelve blocks, north 
five blocks and then two blocks more west, how many blocks did he walk 
altogether?” The next day the same teacher received this note; “Dear 
Teacher — Please don’t send home any more examples about the boy's 
father walking. My husband works hard all day and he needs rest. We 
want to help Tommy in school but his father can’t do so much walking.” 
The reader can from imagination reconstruct the home study problem 
which brought the following note. “Dear Teacher — Please if you send 
home any more sums for William to do have them in water instead of 
beer (This came from England). Last night, the sum was ‘If you have a 
three gallon bucket of beer and take out three quarts, how much will be 
left?’ Well, we bought the beer though we didn’t need so much, and then 
we spilled some.” 
We think of persons who have these troubles as stupid 
because they are only concrete; like the paper hanger who 
found how much paper was required for a room by applying 
each length to the wall and then counting lengths, they are 
using a most concrete but very slow and uneconomical method, 
uncomfortably near to the mental process of a savage or even 
an intelligent lower animal. Enough has been said to show 
that concreteness alone is not the goal of arithmetic teaching. 
5. Freeing from the concrete in instruction. In teaching 
beginners concretely the word must include much not present 
to the senses but depending upon memory. Words themselves 
are symbols to get rid of the concrete. Very little children 
talk about two apples and one apple as being equal to three 
apples though no apples are actually present. By use of many 
and diverse objects, number ideas soon emerge as independent 
of any particular objects. At a certain stage in counting the 
pupil may say, “Gyp is one, Rover is two, and Frisk is three;” 
if Gyp is not present, he may still say “Rover is two, and Frisk 
is three,” the number names being attached to individuals.
-P-A-G-E-213
  The Teaching of Arithmetic 205 
By degrees number experience widens so that it is freed from 
this individual significance, but the same tendency to attach 
general relationships to specific objects remains and needs to 
be guarded against. In advanced classes the teacher is con- 
stantly confronted with the fact that only concrete and not 
general results have been obtained from his teaching. A 
bit of recitation copied from

It is called a trapezoid. 
What is figure (b)? 
I don’t know. 
Is it a trapezoid? 
Oh, no; it is not a trapezoid. (0) 
In the following problems ability to stick clearly to the 
principle involved is severely tested because of unusual con- 
crete relationships. 
a. Find the content and convex surface of a cylinder four 
feet in diameter and eight feet long. (Confusing because the 
circumference of the base and the area of the base are the 
same and the convex surface is the same as the cubic content.) 
b. The population of Chicago in a certain year was about 
three thousand; twenty years later it was 90,100. What was 
the per cent of increase? (Pupils unlikely to give correct 
answer because the rate is so much greater than they are 
accustomed to in their answers.) 
c. Algebra teachers who feel that their pupils know that 
exponents are added in multiplication, often find that pupils 
fail utterly when examples are given which involve literal
-P-A-G-E-214
  206 The Technique of Teaching 
exponents. Pupils are at home with the familiar numbers; 
they have not a grasp of the abstract principle of adding 
exponents. It is not suggested that children can always be 
brought to a realization of abstractions; to some extent they 
must be, and teachers should usually be aware of the degree 
to which progress in this direction is being made. 
A not unusual mistake of teachers is to keep pupils too long 
upon the concrete and objective in number work, or to allow 
them to depend too long upon object-reckoning. The primary 
teacher who carries out the idea that all children entering 
school need to use the abacus should make sure that none of 
them are quite at home in the simpler stages of the multi- 
plication table and the processes of addition and subtraction. 
Pupils who have been permitted, or even encouraged to count 
fingers, dots, or marks in the beginning should not be allowed 
to continue such objective reckoning beyond its period of 
legitimate service; to go through life as a “dotter” or finger 
counter is a serious load to carry. It is using the tools of primi- 
tive man in competition with the methods of civilization; 
in a sense, dotters and finger counters are “a thousand years 
behind the times.” 
6. Concrete, abstract, and back to concrete, the goal. Once the 
figures are understood as standing for the concrete, much 
of our teaching attention must be centered upon rendering 
their use automatic; we must forget during operation that 
the figures stand for anything and juggle symbols. Like other 
useful inventions there is no advantage in recalling when in 
use what they may consist of. The mechanic who pulls a 
lever need waste no thought concerning the metal of which 
it is made or the color of the paint used in its decoration; 
the pupil who adds does not think of the addends as “three 
apples, four apples, seven apples, six apples” but as 3, 4, 7, 6, 
and when he has mechanically performed the addition he 
announces “twenty apples.” There is no advantage in carrying

Content and form — instruction and drill differentiated. 
A clear separation may be made between content and form 
in arithmetic. The former involves knowledge, reasoning, 
thinking, instruction; the latter skill, mechanics, drill. Only 
by being aware of each type of learning and its appropriate 
teaching procedure may results be definitely assured. Success 
in developing speed and accuracy in addition may have little 
to do with the knowledge of what or when to add. 
Instruction must make sure that children comprehend 
many simple terms too often taken for granted. While pupils 
are mastering the mechanics of the elementary combinations, 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
  208 The Technique of Teaching 
they should become intelligent as to the meaning of light, 
heavy, smaller, larger, shorter, shortest, taller, tallest. They 
should become acquainted with such conceptions and with 
common geometric figures by measuring, drawing lines of a 
given length and dividing them into equal parts, comparing 
distances, areas, and weights. Instruction is the dominant 
teaching activity in making quantitative terms intelligible; 
it is principally concerned with problem solving and the 
informational phases of arithmetic. 
Drill and habit formation. The more thoroughly automatic 
and mechanical they are made, the better will the calculation 
phases of problems be performed. In beginning work it may 
be pleasant to picture apples on the tree, or in baskets, but all 
this imagery, as has been shown, hinders addition of the 
column whose result will be labeled bushels of apples. The 
purpese-of_drill is to render computation quick and accurate 
and automatic through function of the proper number habits 
or bonds; accuracy and speed are the aims. 
me ecuraey and speed. Accuracy in the fundamentals 
is not achieved until necessity for thought in reckoning has 
been reduced to a minimum; it is when we stop to think that 
mistakes are made in column addition or other process work. 
Accuracy is more important than speed; only results which 
are one hundred per cent correct — the standard of the adding 
machine — are worth anything. While drill can be depended 
upon to increase both accuracy and speed, growth in accuracy 
does not always make equal progress with increased speed. 
Inaccuracy seems to be a result of getting combinations 
wrong in the first place, of inattention, or, even of mental 
distraction due to haste. The obvious result of making mis- 
takes is to leave an increased tendency to make the same 
ones again. Slower progress is to be recommended if it means 
making fewer errors; one half the tables one hundred per cent 
correct is better than all ninety-nine per cent right.
-P-A-G-E-217
  
The Teaching of Arithmetic 209 
Speed drills must be given in conformity with the laws of 
habit formation. Repetition is of value only when it is atten- 
tive and centered upon correct forms and results. Attention 
is best secured by convincing pupils that the general purpose 
is worth while, and by variety secured through ingenious 
use of devices, such as competitive games and contests between 
individuals and groups, and competing with one’s own previous 
score, even when this requires a considerable amount of book- 
keeping by pupils themselves. Such record keeping itself 
involves practice of a not very intensive character but quite 
worth while. Games, card, and blackboard devices which 
alert teachers devise or adopt may be found for every drill 
topic. (See pages 242-254.) 
2. Habit formation in use of processes. Drill for habit 
formation plays its part outside of manipulation of number 
combinations themselves. The following quotation indicates 
its large province in mastery of arithmetic. 
“The importance of habit formation or connection making has been 
grossly underestimated by the majority of teachers and writers of text- 
books. For, in the first place, mastery by deductive reasoning of such 
matters as ‘carrying’ in addition, ‘borrowing’ in subtraction, the value of 
the digits in partial products in multiplication, the manipulation of the 
figures in division, the placing of the decimal point after multiplication or 
division with decimals, or the manipulation of the figures in the multi- 
plication and division of fractions is impossible or extremely unlikely 
in the case of children of the ages and experiences in question. They do 
not as a rule deduce the method of manipulation from their knowledge 
of decimal notation. Rather they learn about decimal notation by carry- 
ing, borrowing, writing the last figure of each partial product under the 
multiplier which gave that product, etc. They learn the method of manip- 
ulating numbers by seeing them employed, and by more or less blindly 
acquiring them as associative habits.” (E. L. Thorndike: “The Consti- 
tution of Arithmetical Abilities,” Journal of Educational Psychology, 
XII — 14.)

thorough drill upon the forty-five elementary combinations. 
Though none is to be omitted, the amount of repetition | 
necessary to insure automatism varies with the difficulty 
of the combination. Reasonably exhaustive studies with 
which common experience essentially agrees, rank them accord-

experience of all teachers, and it is not likely to conform with 
the trouble curve of many pupils. In general, it will prove

nearly true and the suggestion that such a list may be made 
for individuals and classes is worthy of application.

2. Checking results in addition. As pupils advance in column 
addition, checking their work in various ways affords well 
motivated practice and may occasionally prove of practical 
significance, though emphasis is constantly on not making 
mistakes rather than discovering those made. Adding columns 
up and then down, and adding columns separately, combining 
their sums as in example a, are methods used.

3. Speed through practice rather than short processes. Speed 
in addition should come through practice rather than through 
abbreviated or novel processes so far as pupils in grade or 
rural schools are concerned. Teaching children to add two 
columns at a time is bad practice since it introduces new habit 
bonds which can be used but occasionally. The only practical 
ideal is that of proceeding along the column at a uniform and 
reasonably rapid rate. A device which usually makes an 
a. 6 b. 6 appeal, when first suggested, is that of 
finding tens in the column being added. 
Instead of adding as in column a. “one, 
four, ten, seventeen, twenty-five, twenty- 
seven, thirty-five, thirty-eight, forty- 
five, fifty-one,” the series would be 
grouped as in 0. “Ten, seventeen, twenty- 
five, thirty-five, forty-five, fifty-one.” 
Though this might seem a time saving 
device, it is likely to result in inaccuracy 
and increase of mental effort, One\s fee

tempted to find tens though the numbers seized to make 
them are not consecutive in the column. By such skipping, 
numbers are occasionally omitted and the mental strain of 
wondering whether all have been included is greater than any 
possible economy due to grouping into tens. 
4. Speed standards. According to Courtis, the speed in 
addition which pupils should attain is indicated in the following 
exercise which should be completed     
    
   By fourth year pupils in six minutes. 
By fifth year pupils in about five minutes. 
By sixth grade pupils in four minutes. 
By seventh grade pupils in three and one half minutes. 
By eighth grade pupils in three minutes. 
The exercise consists of seventy-two single column examples 
of three numbers each.

  214 The Technique of Teaching 
5. Difficulties encountered by pupils. The pupil in beginning 
column addition sometimes encounters difficulties which are 
the result of habits we have taken care that he shall form. 
The first of these is object reckoning which may have persisted 
in the form of counting fingers, making marks or dots. It 
has been said that a pupil is within his rights in counting his 
fingers in the earlier stages of arithmetical experience. Some — 
strenuously prohibit such counting from the first. They argue 
that since it is to be dropped as soon as the combinations are 
mastered, a better plan is to attach the counting to objects 
which are not inseparable and ever handy. Thus it might be 
better to count sticks or grains of corn since these can be 
taken away. The use of the numeral frame or abacus by 
teachers who do not permit finger counting rests upon the 
same belief. 
The pupil who has been accustomed to write results of 
Oye 3) 184

the habit over in such examples as 34 , saying, “Four and 
512 
eight are twelve; write the twelve; three and two are five.” 
At this stage a long explanation about carrying one ten of 
units over to the next place is entirely out of the question] 
as it represents only waste of effort. After making sure tha

  The Teaching of Arithmetic 215 
only one figure is written after adding the first column and 
that under the column; the 1 over is added to the 2 of the 
38 76 
next column. Then add a few examples like 44 and 45. In 
adding these the carried figure may be added to the first 
added figure of the next column at once, or it may be written 
below or beside the other figure to keep it in mind. Such a 
“crutch” soon becomes unnecessary but it does little harm if 
the figure is made small enough to avoid confusion with those 
of the original example. With columns which are a little 
longer, with pupils who are easily distracted, or with very 
long columns, writing the carrying figure is an economical 
expedient,‘since it renders unnecessary going back to the first 
if interruption occurs. An addition example with these check- 
ing figures is given to illustrate:

Subtraction. 1. Drill upon subtraction combinations. As 
in addition, mastery of elementary combinations in subtraction 
is fundamental, and many of the devices useful in the former 
are applicable. If it is true that pupils are usually less quick 
and accurate in subtraction than in addition, the fact may 
be partly traced to the comparatively slight amount of drill 
upon subtraction combinations. 
2. Teach but one method. The attempt to turn subtraction’ 
into addition by the so-called Austrian method, in which the 
subtrahend figure is added to the remainder figure as it is 
written, has probably caused much waste in school. No 
conclusive evidence has been produced to prove the superiority 
of this method and the confusion resulting from uncertainty 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
  216 The Technique of Teaching 
of two processes rather than automatic performance of one 
has crippled many pupils. Whichever plan is employed in 
acquiring the earliest combinations, should be steadfastly 
followed throughout the grades. 
3. The borrowing difficulty. The borrowing difficulty is 
best met by presenting a single new process at a time, as 
indicated in examples a, 6, and c. 
E54: 216 | 561). b. 154.137) 16 |G.) 163! 142) 226n 
AL. 114. 220 92) 44) 160 85 27 176   
The first is simply a series of subtraction combinations; 
the second involves borrowing in a form already familiar; 
the third introduces an unfamiliar situation. No long ex- 
planations are needed; show what is done in order to secure 
the correct result and then give abundant practice involving 
the new element — borrowing. One teacher wishing to make 
a sufficient impression in this process gave a subtraction ex- 
ample reaching entirely across a thirty foot blackboard. 
This may have been unnecessarily long and correspondingly 
fatiguing, but many teachers lose the result of their drill 
efforts by not requiring enough immediate application and 
repetition of processes to be acquired. 
4. Incorrect expressions. Incorrect forms of expression are 
often in evidence in connection with subtraction. Pupils 
read “163-85” as “163 take away 85”—not an impossibly 
bad form of expression, but certainly not the best. Now and 
then they fall into the expression “subtracted to” which of 
course has no meaning. For the foregoing, “Subtract 85 from 
163,” “163 less 85,” or “163 minus 85” are correct forms. Awk- 
ward and inaccurate discussion of examples also arises because 
pupils are not required to name the terms used in addition 
and subtraction; learning definitions of these is hardly in- 
dispensable, but all may by explanation and practice be led 
to understand and use the terms sum, difference, remainder,
-P-A-G-E-225
  The Teaching of Arithmetic 217 
addend, minuend, subtrahend before leaving the elementary 
grades. 
5. Proving subtraction. Proving subtraction affords valuable 
practice in addition and is possessed of occasional practical value. 
As in addition, stress is to be placed upon making no mistakes 
rather than upon finding errors after they have been made. 
Suggestions in teaching multiplication. 1. Introduce new 
elements in proper sequence. Drill in multiplication is most 
economical if but one new element at a time is presented.) 
In the accompanying series all necessary procedures are 
successively introduced. Rigid insistence upon following 
this sequence exactly achieves nothing, but fewer obstacles 
are encountered if this order is approximately adhered to. 
The ideal of one thing at a time suggests the wisdom of in- 
troducing each new process by using the easier combinations; 
attention is thus upon the unfamiliar procedure and not 
upon results which do not come easily.

2. Upper limits in value of multiplication tables. There is 
little economy in teaching the multiplication table above 
9x9; combinations like 9x12, I1x1II, and 12x12 will 
often be learned incidentally but they are scarcely worthy 
of drill. The child who has been taught to use these is likely 
to waste time looking at such examples as 236 x 12 to see 
whether it will “pay” to multiply by 12 or to use 1 and 2. 
Economy is best served by knowing but a single way, that 
one being the best. Teaching the 15’s and other higher tables 
rests upon the same foundation. 
Suggestions in teaching division. 1. Elements of the pro- 
cess. Elementary combinations in division require the same 
intensive drill as in other fundamental processes, and many 
of the same devices with slight adaptation may be employed. 
After these have been mastered, pupils should early become 
acquainted with the various ways of writing indicated division; 
  
12 e.g., 12 + 4, 4) 12, a? 4) aioe 
When exercises are begun which involve more than results 
found by inspection, the carrying difficulty is encountered.
-P-A-G-E-227
  The Teaching of Arithmetic 219 
This is best met by having pupils solve many examples which 
do not require the carrying step, suchas 4) 368, 2) 864,   
3) 153. Then when the more difficult type, 5) 375, 
7) 126, and 2) 538 , is introduced, the one new step is 
rendered easier for some pupils by telling them to pretend 
that the amount remaining after each division is written before 
the next figure. With an occasional pupil who is not good at this 
sort of make-believe, the carried remainder may actually be 
written; this seems, to quote one little learner, “to make the 
problem sit still long enough for me to get a good look at it.” 
Such actually indicated crutches should soon be discarded. 
As between the forms 59 ) 2,345,562 ( and 59 ) 2,345,562 
there is an advantage for beginners in the latter. By this 
plan, it may be most clearly shown that each additional 
figure of the dividend after the first division calls for a quotient 
figure. Especially vigilant must the teacher be with such 
examples as 8 ) 32,016 or 21 ) 42,084. Under some vague 
impression that o is nothing and therefore not worth any atten- 
tion, pupils are reasonably sure to omit the zero in the quotient. 
2. Introducing long division. Long division is best not 
presented until multiplication tables are mastered. It may 
then be taught as a process with little regard for reasons. 
After the teacher has solved a few examples, calling attention 
to similarities between this work and short division, the names 
of the four steps in their unvarying order shouldbe written 
on the blackboard 
Divide 
Multiply 
Subtract 
Annex  
-P-A-G-E-228
  220 The Technique of Teaching 
and these used as a guide in solving other examples. After 
many solutions have been performed by pupils and teacher, 
an assignment may be given for application of the process, 
unguided except by referring when necessary to this list of 
steps. 
In selecting exercises for these first lessons, the greatest 
care must be taken to avoid exceptional cases until the process 
has been well fixed, so that the pupil through habit does the 
right thing next. Thus: 
a. 4284 + 42 is not good owing to the zero needed in the 
quotient. 
b. 1152 + 29 presents too much difficulty in finding the 
first quotient figure. 
c. 1004 + 18 and 3240 + 80 are not typical because of 
zeros in the dividend. Best results accrue from focalizing 
upon the process in hand and not allowing irrelevant conditions 
to interfere. 
A serious difficulty of the beginner is that of estimating the 
number of times the divisor is contained in the part of the 
dividend he is using. He is almost sure to think only of the 
first figure of the divisor; from this viewpoint 16 ) 5762 is 
far more difficult than 61 ) 5762. He must be taught to regard 
the second figure in making these estimates. It is economy 
to spend considerable time in making estimates of the first 
quotient figure as soon as the process has been learned. “How 
often? 21 ) 130, 19 ) 130, 49 ) 1502” used as class drill, and 
blackboard contests in finding the first quotient figure are 
effective. 
3. Incorrect expressions in division. Inaccurate expressions 
frequently used by pupils are especially characteristic of 
number relations themselves. In 3245 + 34, “thirty-four 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
  
The Teaching of Arithmetic 221 
divided into 3245” is often heard, the mistake seemingly 
due to a feeling that the divisor is measured into the dividend. 
Another wrong expression is illustrated in “If you divide 450 
by 15 you have 30 left.” This confusion of quotient with 
remainder is probably due to the fact that division of whole 
numbers, like subtraction, results in a smaller number than 
the dividend with which the work begins. The same habit 
bonds are rudely disturbed when it is found that dividing 
by a fraction results in a quotient larger than the dividend. 
Course of study and textbooks. 1. Textbooks for formal 
exercises. Arithmetic textbooks roughly indicate the course 
of study which is being followed, though it is not safe to infer 
that the actual material used in classrooms is as formal as 
a study of textbooks alone might indicate. Examination of 
a textbook printed in 1514 shows that it was a very mechanical 
book. The same test applied to some of the more widely 
used books of the present likewise indicates that formal exer- 
cises occupy three-fourths of their space. The actual course 
of study is what teachers bring pupils in contact with, and 
it is safe to assert that some have given rich experience to 
their pupils even with the little, formal books used in the 
past. It is hoped that a much larger per cent are doing this 
to-day. 
2. Analysis of textbook content. The important purposes 
of modern arithmetic textbooks,’as indicated in their content, 
are to furnish the following; 
a. Drill exercises for all processes to be acquired. 
b. Principles and rules stated or to be developed, with 
explanations of processes and relations. 
c. Problems in application of processes and principles. 
d. Answers to problems for guidance of pupils. 
e. General information of various kinds conveyed in 
statements of problems and in other ways not directly math- 
ematical.
-P-A-G-E-230
    222 The Technique of Teaching 
Among textbook makers there has been great diversity of 
practice in the relative amount of attention given to each of 
the foregoing phases. According to one theory, the principal 
function of an arithmetic textbook is to bring about economy 
for pupils and teacher by providing a sufficient supply of 
drill exercises to save copying. The little arithmetic manuals 
used in some European schools embody this idea; they contain 
only a well graded series of examples, without explanations 
or rules. To say that three-fourths of some of our widely 
used arithmetics is formal material is not their condemnation, 
though such content readily leads to mechanical and lifeless 
teaching. Drill exercises may be so skillfully made that they 
prove well adapted to needs of children in every section of 
the country, whereas the best problems in application of pro- 
cesses are those constructed by the teacher with the needs 
and interests of pupils in mind. It is probably safe to predict 
that, as teachers become more skilled, arithmetic textbooks 
will find their greatest field in providing for process work, 
leaving an increasing amount of the application to teachers. 
Newer books show this tendency in their suggestions to teach- 
ers. The subject of drill has already received consideration 
in pages 208-215; the other phases of textbook scope are 
presented in the pages which follow. 
Principles, rules, and explanation. 1. Inductive presenta- 
tion and memorizing. Satisfactory textbooks may be found 
which contain many rules, few rules, or none at all. Formerly 
the rule, principle, or definition was first stated and its applica- 
tion made a deductive exercise; present practice places more 
stress upon inductive development, though deductive applica- 
tion very properly forms a large part of all arithmetic courses. 
Instead of starting with definitions of mixed numbers and 
fractions, pupils are made familiar with these by using them. 
They pass through a concrete stage in which “mixed numbers 
are like 4 1/2, 3 2/3, or 5 1/7, and fractions are like 1/2,
-P-A-G-E-231
  
The Teaching of Arithmetic 223 
1/3 and 2/5” serves a useful defining purpose, and some pupils 
never get beyond this stage. 
The best teaching insists that a few rules and principles 
must be memorized. If teacher and class can formulate a well 
worded, accurate, convenient statement of number relation- 
ships, no one can reasonably object to having it learned thor- 
oughly. Very often the rules given in textbooks are perfectly 
worded, in much better form than teacher and class are likely 
to achieve; they are convenient of access and insure the 
common understanding resulting from uniformity. Rational 
objection to rules in textbooks have been based upon bad 
use made of them by a few teachers rather than upon the 
presence of rules themselves. The pupil who glibly recites 
a definition has little idea of its significance unless it represents 
the culmination of a stage in his mental development. If 
the stage is duly reached without proper verbal crystallization 
and fixing of the important truth, loss of valuable preliminary 
effort is the result. 
2. Important generalizations memorized. The kind of general- 
izations which need to be learned is represented in the accom- 
panying list: 
a. Multiplying or dividing both terms of a fraction by the 
same number does not alter its value. 
b. Place units under units and tens under tens. 
c. Only like numbers can be added. 
d. To divide a fraction by a fraction, invert the divisor 
and multiply. 
3. Explanatory material auxiliary to pupils. Some arith- 
metics contain explanatory material related to each new 
process in succession. If well worked out such exercises are 
a guide to young teachers, at least suggesting the general 
form which ‘urrent practice approves. Teacher and class 
very profitably study them together. They are props for 
the pupil who has hardly grasped a new process or has for-  
-P-A-G-E-232
  224 The Technique of Teaching 
gotten the explanation given in class and may yet plod through 
a book explanation with profit to himself. 
Problems. 1. Problems or examples? The term problem 
is commonly used to include concrete applications of arith- 
metic, example being that employed to denote number exercises 
without application to anything more concrete than the num- 
bers themselves. Strictly speaking a problem may be an ex- 
ample if it exemplifies some principle or rule and an example is 
a problem if it is a task set for performance and requiring de- 
liberation and adaptation of means to ends. The words 
example and problem are used indiscriminately by most 
teachers and neither can be branded as wrong in any given 
case without knowing what is in the mind of the speaker. 
Application and drill exercises are most directly perceived 
to be examples; those requiring judgment preéminently are 
best thought of as problems. In this discussion, problem is 
used unless it is desired to stress the habit type of work. 
2. Types of problems. a. Problems may involve actual buy- 
ing and selling as in the case of raising or expending money for 
some school project. Money is actually handled and value 
is received for it. Such problems have a great. advantage in 
vividness, motivation, and assured understanding. A principal 
reason, however, that arithmetic is taught in school is that 
real problems do not occur with sufficient frequency to insure 
enough practice to beget understanding of processes or 
facility in their use. An alert teacher capitalizes every real 
need of his pupils, either individually or as a group, turning 
it to account in making problems. 
b. A second type of problem is applied to play groups of 
various kinds. The need for number is as direct and real 
as in the preceding, though the pupil is conscious of the 
difference. He may become excited about the keeping of 
score in a spelling “ball” game or other contest and do pains- 
taking work. All the while, however, he knows it is a thing
-P-A-G-E-233
The Teaching of Arithmetic 225 
of the school. Counting words or scores is not like counting 
money in real buying and selling. A mistake is a less serious 
matter since after all it is only a game. 
c. A third type of problem is that in which the pupil 
can have only a vicarious interest. In imagination he identifies 
himself more or less dramatically with the situation of another 
who may have a real problem to solve. In statements be- 
ginning, “Mr. Smith buys,” “Mr. Jones sells,” and “The Polar 
Ice Company purchases,” he must for the time being adopt 
the problem of Mr. Smith, Mr. Jones, or the Polar Ice Com- 
pany. This adopted interest is more remote than in the pre- 
ceding case, and yet it rests upon some one’s practical needs. 
d. A fourth type of problem is based upon speculative 
interests, the “I wonder how much” of early school years. As 
in the preceding case, the pupil adopts such problems as his 
own. “How tall is the tree in the school yard?” “How many 
steps are saved by going across the square diagonally?” and 
“What will the population of the home town be in the year 
2000 A.D., given the present population and rate of increase?” 
are examples. Practical these are not, but many children like 
them quite as well as if they were and they are certainly an 
effective means of acquainting the child with the big world 
of which he is becoming a citizen. The capable teacher shows 
skill in inspiring pupils to adopt, as their own, problems of 
the last two types as well as in devising problems of the first 
Awo. 
3. Characteristics of problems. a. Real life or hypothetical 
conditions. Textbook problems are principally of the third 
and fourth types. It is the local setting and adaptation which 
the teacher is constantly called upon to give. The fact that 
book or school problems are likely to be isolated from a com- 
plex of related conditions, is an element of decided strength 
if sufficient application is made to real life situations. Because 
it is difficult to find a sufficient supply of them, real life problems “e 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
  226 The Technique of Teaching . 
may well be given first place in the teacher’s thoughts, though 
hypothetical and vicarious problems are for many purposes 
better. 
b. Problems should deal with familiar but varied activities. 
The first requirement is easily overworked; pupils are not 
essentially more interested in egg gathering, which they may 
know too well, than in reckoning street car fares, with which 
they may have little acquaintance. Both because of the inter- 
est compelling nature of variety and the incidental information 
which problems from widely different fields convey, community 
arithmetic is preferable to farm arithmetic for rural children 
who may be quite as much interested in problems of the store, 
shop, or railroad station as in many familiar phases of their 
own work. An understanding of his neighbor’s problems not 
directly related to agriculture is worth more to his social 
interests than too exclusive computations of balanced rations. 
Likewise the demand that city children shall study city arith- 
metic ignores the important fact that no one is independent 
of the activities which provide the world’s food. 
c. Conditions specified in a problem must be true or at least 
possible. Many problems constructed extemporaneously 
during the enthusiasm of class exercises are lacking in this 
characteristic. Quoting eggs at five cents or five hundred 
dollars a dozen, or imposing other improbable conditions 
merely distracts attention from what is being taught. If 
drill is the purpose, numbers alone, unencumbered by names 
or commodities, are often best according to the ideal of teach- 
ing one thing at a time. 
d. Uniformity of statement does not stimulate thinking. 
Lists of problems expected to provoke thought must be varied 
in form. In the initial stages of mastering any process or 
meeting a new judgment situation, repeating the same form 
is psychologically justifiable; if the same forms are repeated 
and no others used in thought work, natural inertia of mind,
-P-A-G-E-235
  The Teaching of Arithmetic 227 
unwillingness to think when thinking is necessary, results 
in a mechanical process where alert thinking should prevail. 
“Are these like the ones we had yesterday?” “Are these solved 
the same way as those on page ?” “Do we multiply or 
divide in this lesson?” and even dependence upon rhythmic 
similarities in reading the problem as, “If one man can do a 
piece of work in six days ” are symptoms resulting from 
too many problems alike in form. Whether mechanical- 
minded pupils are made more intellectually helpless by 
repeating the same forms in thought work may not be easy 
to determine. Assuredly solving long lists of such exercises 
does nothing to lessen the tendency to ditto their mental 
paths. The teacher may reasonably be expected to know 
at all times what is probably being accomplished by a given 
series of problems. 
e. Problems in which a knowledge of the answer 1s necessary 
before they can be formulated are not usually desirable, though 
numerous in some textbooks. They conform in no degree to 
life problem situations and the analysis they require is dif- 
ficult for minds which adhere closely to the concrete. “I 
spent two-fifths of my money for a hat, one-half of the remain- 
der for a pair of shoes, and had six dollars left,” represents 
this type of problem. If given at all, they should be recognized 
as exercises or examples to give practice and should not be 
thought of as practical in any sense. 
f. All problems should be so formulated as to serve the specific 
purpose for which they are used. In addition they may be 
expected to provide logical training or a sense for the reason- 
able and well arranged, in language which is simple, clear and 
correct. These requirements do not prevent wisely deliberate 
inclusion of irrelevant matter, since one of the purposes of 
teaching is to accustom pupils to differentiating accurately 
between what is needed and what is not needed in solving 
their problems.   
 
-P-A-G-E-236
    228 The Technique of Teaching 
4. Instruction in problem solving. a. Make pupils conscious 
of the steps in a typical solution. Effective teaching of arith- 
metic gradually reveals to pupils their method of solving 
problems. The difficulty of either developing or measuring 
ability in this field arises from the fact that a real problem 
as opposed to a drill situation always involves a new element. 
As soon as one has been solved and understood, all others in 
its class have in a degree ceased to be problems. So long as 
changes in a series of exercises involve only names, commod- 
ities, or amounts, there may be no new situation — the very 
essence of a problem—unless the changes themselves are great 
enough to make the entire complex of elements a new puzzle. 
In solving a real problem, five fairly distinct steps may always 
be discovered and until pupils have learned these, they are 
not sufficiently acquainted with the nature of sure and eco- 
nomical problem solving. The steps in the solution of a prob- 
lem are these: 
1. Given: Determining accurately what has been given. 
ut. To find: Determining what is to be found. 
ur. Estimate: Making an estimate or approximation. 
Iv. Solution: The solution itself, the process. 
v. Proof: Verifying the result. 
The most difficult part of problem work is included in the 
first two steps. Most pupils are not strong in visualizing a 
situation meagerly set forth in the words of a book. In real 
life problems the setting may be more vivid but the state- 
ment must be abstracted from a complex of slightly related 
elements. Analysis of teaching difficulties usually reveals 
the presence of some or all of the causes of trouble next dis- 
cussed. 
b. Motor anxiety to begin making figures. The motor na- 
ture of children makes them anxious to be doing something; 
they are in a hurry to be at it, to make figures, To this natural
-P-A-G-E-237
The Teaching of Arithmetic 229 
tendency is added the rivalry carried over to some extent 
from the drill period in which speed is at a premium. Further, 
thinking is hard work; deliberation and calm study of the 
situation so necessary in problem solving, seem to be accom- 
plishing nothing since no figures are being made. Removing 
all pressure for haste by making individual assignments, and 
holding before pupils the ideal of knowing where they are 
going before a start is made reduce this inopportune pressure 
of motor and rivalry tendencies. 
c. Inability to read the problem. Pupils sometimes can- 
not and oftener do not read the problems set for them to 
solve. Because of the tendencies noted in the preceding 
paragraph, they frequently make figures before the problem 
has been read through. The presence of unfamiliar words adds 
difficulties which the teacher needs to realize are linguistic 
and not mathematical. If the textbook is too difficult in 
its language, preliminary reading lessons may be taught before 
problems are assigned for solution. This represents only one 
way out of a bad situation; arithmetic textbooks ought not 
to contain many words unfamiliar to the pupils for whose 
use they have been adopted. 
d. Pupil confused by presence of many or irrelevant ele- 
ments. Confusion in the presence of a number of new ele- 
ments and inability to select those which are essential to the 
purpose are obstacles even when reading of the problem causes 
no apparent trouble. Some begin to work with the first number 
expressed in the problem and most pupils seem to feel it neces- 
sary to use in computation every number encountered. Ha- 
bitual attitudes carried over from earlier number work 
cripple interpretation. It is vaguely felt that the number to 
be divided must be larger than its divisor, the product must 
be greater than the multiplicand and an array of several 
figures is considered a large number even though a decimal 
point stands before it. A few injunctions like the following,
-P-A-G-E-238
  230 The Technique of Teaching 
oft repeated, will make pupils more inclined to think before 
beginning operations: 
What is given and what are you to find? 
Don’t make any figures until you have read the problem. 
Do not work unless you can give a reason for it. 
Clear teaching leads the pupil to determine which are the 
elements of the situation needed and which are not of present 
consequence; it makes him alert to discover what he can and 
must use in his solution. For furthering this purpose, a valu- 
able device, when employed with discretion, is that of pro- 
pounding occasionally problems which contain unrelated or 
redundant items. Some of these may be mere catch questions; 
in none of them is computation itself a matter of difficulty; in 
every case trouble is over as soon as the pupil has read and 
understood what is given and what is asked. Typical exercises 
for this purpose are the accompanying; others appropriate to 
the class may be easily constructed by the teacher. In using 
such examples, educative results are to be expected only when 
pupils point out clearly what is irrelevant or lacking. 
I entered the store at 9:00 and stayed until 10:30. I bought 
10 apples at six cents each, giving the clerk a one dollar bill. 
How much change did he hand me? 
A bought on Saturday afternoon a dozen apples for 30 cents; 
he sold them to a man leading two small children, for 50 cents. 
The man divided them equally between the children; how much 
profit did A make? 
If six-sevenths of an acre of land cost $120, what will seven- 
eighths of an acre cost at 100% of the same price per acre? 
(The useless 100% in this problem is so confusing that many 
high school graduates fail to find the correct result.) 
If it costs a merchant $300 to pay his force of ten clerks for a 
week, what will the expense be for 34 weeks? (The irrelevant 
“ten” is even more likely to be the cause of confusion if it is 
written “ro.”) 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
  The Teaching of Arithmetic 231 
e. A frequent cause of trouble is inaccurate copying of 
numbers. Even when the problem has been read and under- 
stood, haste or some peculiar defect of vision causes wrong 
figures to be written, a well-known form of this mistake being 
reversal of digits, as 76 for 67. An exercise in copying or writing 
numbers from dictation will prove enlightening. Notation is 
not to be understood alone through pointing off and reading 
numbers; it requires drill upon copying exactly what is given. 
f. Problems without numbers are an excellent device to 
focalize attention upon what is essential. The pupil, who 
rushes into computation without thinking clearly why or 
wherefore, finds in these nothing to begin with; he is puzzled at 
first, is discouraged perhaps, and gives up. Pupils generally 
regard such problems as very “hard,” and some teachers do not 
know how to use them. Too many given at a time, or evena 
short series of puzzlers without proper preparation, yield little 
value for the time spent upon them; skillfully treated, a few at 
a time and interspersed with lighter material, they are a most 
valuable arithmetic device. 
g. Requiring pupils to make their own problems or those 
for the class to solve, approaches the matter from another 
angle; seeing how an exercise is made, it becomes easy to 
recognize what must be included in order that a solution 
may be possible. Remembering what he had to put into a sit- 
uation in constructing it, the pupil is likely to look for the 
corresponding essentials in problems given him to solve. 
In teaching pupils to formulate problems it is well to propose 
incomplete conditions occasionally, and ask what is lacking. 
“A man packed his apples in barrels holding two bushels 
and three pecks each, and sold them at two dollars a bushel; 
how much did he receive for all of them?” is the kind of de- 
fective problem pupils may be asked to evaluate. In assigning 
the task of making up problems, it is sometimes well to impose 
limiting conditions; for example, to specify the amount, allow- 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
  232 The Technique of Teaching 
ing pupils to supply a suitable price. This affords opportunity 
to link arithmetic closely with life, since the price must be 
reasonable or current, to be discovered perhaps through read- 
ing market reports. Problems partly dictated for pupils to 
finish and solve are as interesting as stories partly told and left 
for individual endings. 
h. Making an estimate or approximation. This step, not 
always necessary, is a most convenient check upon process and 
result in problems involving a large amount of computation. 
It is in harmony with the useful conception of problem solving 
as the process of transforming the “much group” of the vaguely 
anticipated answer into the definite “many” of the final result. 
In explanation of this much and many interpretation, it may 
be stated that the first thing a pupil does when a problem is 
assigned is to think of the answer in general terms as a number 
he is going to find; he next proceeds to use processes which will 
find the result accurately. If his problem is “How many dollars 
can one save in 43 weeks, if he saves $12 a week?” he may be 
said to make two solutions. The first is a matter of imagery; he 
projects theresult without definiteness. The second involves final 
computation. The two solutions are represented in (1) and (a): 
Solution (1) Solution (2) 
43 43 
B Les The much—a sum of money The many—$516 
(undefined) (defined) 
In addition to leaping at once to the answer as the undefined 
goal, the pupil, by looking critically at conditions proposed and 
amounts involved and making a few figures perhaps, can 
decide about what the result will be. The estimate may be con- 
veniently stated as a maximum and a minimum, greater than 
— and less than —.. This is quite the method of actual life, 
and it needs more extended use in school. Ask the farmer on
-P-A-G-E-241
The Teaching of Arithmetic 233 
his load of hay what he expects to sell it for, and he is able to 
make a moderately reliable estimate without any figures. Even 
if he knows that it weighs 2225 pounds and that the price is 
$17.50 a ton, he would make few figures before replying that it 
was worth about twenty dollars, and he would not be in the 
least concerned with locating the decimal point, which so many 
pupils lose and thereby achieve absurd results. To illustrate, 
vequiring preliminary estimates effectually fortifies pupils 
against announcing such fantastic results as $121.57 or 
$1215.78 as the interest upon $125.50 at 714% for one year, 
three months, and fifteen days. Pupils can be made clearly 
aware that they are giving an estimate, not a guess. If their 
work represents a mere juggling of capricious symbols out of 
which almost any chance results may come, problems are too 
far advanced and need modification. The teacher who is wise 
enough to employ the step of approximation effectively will 
know when its use is desirable and when it may be omitted. 
i. The solution itself, the process. (1) There is small danger 
of selecting the wrong process if the preceding steps have been 
understood. The best of several possible procedures is to be 
preferred, but it should be remembered that the first value of 
a process is that it works, that is, intelligently gets the answer. 
Pupils are encouraged, for example, to use the least common 
denominator, but it would be a foolish teacher who would mark 
a paper wrong, merely because in a computation, a pupil was so 
intent upon his problem or in so great a hurry that he did not 
take time to find the least common denominator but chose the 
first one which occurred to him. If the result is correct, the 
chances are that processes and principles are right, though these 
may be awkward or slow. A pupil in tears over his home work 
in arithmetic was asked, “What is the matter; can’t you get the 
answers?” “Oh, yes, I get the answers all right.” “Don’t you | 
understand them?” “Yes, I can get the answers and I under- 
stand them, but it’s the process that’s killing me,”

  234 The Technique of Teaching 
There is something wrong with teaching which makes so 
much of what is after all not the principal thing. Insisting 
rigidly upon certain forms of analysis, even though mechani- 
cally executed, and requiring verbose explanations when 
straightforward statements of what was done and its reasons 
would do as well, are examples of teaching waste less often met 
than formerly, but still not hard tofind. The better part of wis- 
dom lies between requiring too many or useless explanations, 
and noneat all. The pupil who is allowed to complete his arith- 
metic experience without being able to tell in correct language 
what he does and the reason for each step has missed the most 
valuable training which the subject, well taught, should give 
him. 
(2) While rigid insistence that every problem must be writ- 
ten out in full is unnecessary, pupils should become conscious 
of the form which typical solutions take. Under the step 
“given,” a sufficient statement is needed to render reading the 
problem from the textbook superfluous, and blackboard data 
must be intelligible enough to admit of enabling pupils to 
explain work done by other members of the class. Two types of 
solutions are presented by way of illustration and to afforda 
basis for discussion of proper forms.

j. Checking and proving results. Checking and proving 
results in problem work are not less necessary than in drill 
exercises. In addition to proofs of computations, these involve 
close scrutiny and verification of methods employed and the 
chain of reasoning followed. Stress has been laid upon holding 
the pupil responsible at all times for justifying each step he 
takes; this is a constant check. So are the estimates or approxi- 
mations he makes before figure making begins. When the work 
is completed and the answer found, he may be expected to ask 
himself whether what he has found is what he set out to dis-  
-P-A-G-E-244
  236 The Technique of Teaching 
cover. If dollars or apples are mentioned in the step of “To 
find,” dollars or apples must be found. If two solutions are 
possible for the same problem, it is usually more interesting to 
verify by the second plan than to repeat the first. Last, there 
is the answer, given by the teacher or found in the textbook 
which acts as the court of last appeal, and indirectly causes a 
searching evaluation of processes and reasoning whenever the 
right answer does not evolve. 
k. Use of answer lists. (1) Answer lists are a legitimate part 
of arithmetic textbooks. The only reasonable objection to them 
is based upon the fact that pupils spend too much time in 
working for them. A valuable part of the pupil’s contact with 
problems is his independent attack, looking the field over and 
proceeding upon his best judgment. After first reading he may 
be in doubt whether to multiply or divide. If an answer is 
staring him in the face it suggests the correct procedure, rob- 
bing him, even against his will, of the need for further thinking. 
For this reason the answer list is preferable to the plan followed 
in the older books of placing answers on the page with the 
problem. Indolent pupils may lean upon the answer wherever 
it is, but much can be done to inspire most children with the 
ideal of independent effort. 
While working for the answer is likely to be overdone, 
answers are properly the principal object in most problems. 
Having a correct result as goal, the pupil can be satisfied with 
no other. Finding his own work unsatisfactory, he challenges 
and verifies all he has done. Many reason backward from the 
answer and in due time gain new understanding of the prob- 
lem. 
(2) In some classes of problems, answers may be given as 
limits between which the correct result is to be found. Though 
answers by limits are not usually found in textbooks, teachers 
can use this plan effectively in problems assigned for seat or 
home work. Answers so given take away little of the pupil's
-P-A-G-E-245
  The Teaching of Arithmetic 237 
chance for initiative and yet provide him with a helpful guide. 
His answer may be between the limits and still be wrong. On 
the other hand he knows he is wrong unless the result is found 
between the extremes given. 
The extent to which heuristic methods can be economically 
applied in the teaching of common school arithmetic varies as 
much as individual pupils themselves. They probably learn 
more from trial and error than is commonly supposed. The goal 
of a correct answer inspires a deal of honest, independent ef- 
fort. Working for answers is not of necessity wasteful guess- 
ing, nor is its result always loss of independence as it is so 
often considered to be. 
Informational material in arithmetic. Non-mathematical in- 
formational material in an arithmetic course cannot be sepa- 
rated by a hard and fast line from the symbolic and abstract. 
Every field of human interest based upon quantitative rela- 
tionships is, to some extent, mathematical; and ability to 
experience the numerical or relational in wide fields of our en- 
vironment is manifestly advantageous. Problems chosen from 
many provinces of human interest are both useful and poten- 
tially informational. Those beginning

are examples of problems in which incidental information is 
acquired by children. While buying and selling are the prin- 
cipal and most practical application of arithmetic, they do not 
by any means comprise its entire purpose. A liberally con- 
ceived textbook includes problems taken from the cultural
-P-A-G-E-246
  
238 The Technique of Teaching 
and general in our environment. These may frankly possess 
no vocational significance, but they are keenly relished by 
children with intellectual appetites. In a sense the most prom- 
ising child is the one who has curiosity concerning the greatest 
diversity of things, and it is surely the school’s business to en- 
courage wideness of interest rather than to confine attention 
narrowly to what is needed. 
Further informational material is found in projects built 
upon certain industries or occupations. As an example, there 
is much beside mathematical value in agricultural problems 
concerning the care of farm machinery, balanced rations, and 
soil chemistry. Specialized problems of the carpenter, the 
painter, the banker, or the housewife likewise carry such in- 
formation. Household accounts, how to send money, the parcel 
post, property and personal insurance, taxes, use of statistical 
tables and simple graphs, are all quite as much informational as 
mathematical. Such material as the weight of a cubic foot of 
water, or a bushel of wheat, the amount of wall paper in a roll, 
legal interest rates, or the value of foreign money, is more 
specifically arithmetical. A further field worthy of fuller de- 
velopment is historical—how people used to count and write 
their numbers or compute before better methods were invented. 
Lesson Assignments. 1. Making purpose clear. Because 
of its peculiar nature, arithmetic is more nearly self-motivating 
than other school subjects. For most pupils, the lesson con- 
sists essentially of a series of goals—answers—to be attained. 
The difficulty of the arithmetic assignment is in making clear 
what these goals are and holding closely to requirements. The 
problem calls for the amount; pupils find the interest. If the 
area of a circle is needed, they may be satisfied with the size 
of circumference. In most cases of thought difficulty, pupils 
are unable to forecast or visualize clearly enough the how much 
of the result which their computation is to resolve into the 
better defined how many.

     To make clear the assignment, the suggestions already made 
for problem solving need to be applied with judicious emphasis. 
Small children frequently comprehend a problem read by the 
teacher, even though it has been meaningless as they read it 
alone. Usually arithmetic employed in construction projects 
carries sufficient concrete application to prevent confusion of 
ends to be attained. 
2. Inspiring confidence. For the minority of pupils who 
think they have no head for arithmetic, a fixed idea which a 
few parents unfortunately aggravate by repeating before the 
child the fact that none of the family have any mathematical 
ability, the daily function of the assignment is to build up 
confidence. While some of those who become discouraged fail 
to discover any significance in their problems and need an 
unusual amount of specific application to home and community 
life, the most general cause of trouble is failure to master 
completely the mechanical processes necessary in computation. 
Many an upper intermediate grade pupil loses his arithmetic 
morale because of what he fancies to be a hard problem when 
the real trouble is that he cannot use correctly 7 x 8 or is un- 
able to keep columns of figures in line. He wastes half his 
mental energy in thinking about what should be performed 
mechanically. 
A special case is the pupil who is made nervous in the pres- 
ence of specific requirements characteristic of many arithmetic 
lassignments. Instead 6f saying to such pupils, “Hand in ten of 
these exercises,” pressure may be relieved in individual cases 
iby the more encouraging, “Get as many as you can.” Most to 
avoided in the arithmetic assignment is the panic attitude 
‘ot infréquently met, in which an unhappy pupil hastily but 
lindly gropes from one attempt to another in an activity 
hich is to him without joy or purpose. 
The arithmetic study period. 1. Study questions. Study 
uestions, for which modern technique increasingly finds a 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  240 The Technique of Teaching 
place in all subjects, have always been important in arithmetic 
teaching. The recent tendency to organize subject matter into 
larger projects means in arithmetic fewer detached problems 
and greater attention to community applications. Less taught 
in isolation than formerly, it takes a place in such activities as 
keeping household or farm accounts or in carrying on manual 
training, athletics, or agricultural school projects. 
Not a few of the drill devices suggested may be given the 
form of a game which the pupil plays with himself as seat work. 
Every test which establishes a standard score, furnishes the 
studying pupil an incentive to bring his record up to grade. 
It is these definite goals which stimulate individual prac- 
tice. 
2. Home study. As a home study subject arithmetic, while 
generally used, is the occasion of much waste. Sending a pupil 
home with problems he does not and cannot unaided under- 
stand is a hazardous performance. Many parents cannot 
render assistance, some are too busy and others with the best 
of intentions confuse children by use of methods slightly dif- 
ferent from those employed at school. If only application work 
or drill exercises are sent home, study waste of this kind is 
reduced to a minimum. 
3. Supervised study. In supervised study, it is the skilled 
teacher who leads the pupil to do his own work; the crude artist 
does all the thinking while the pupil makes the figures. Little 
is gained from the kind of perseverance which persists half an 
hour at a process which is entirely beyond comprehension, but 
it is wrong to rob pupils of all opportunity for real effort. 
Supervised study technique in arithmetic presents unique 
opportunity for silent observation of the pupil’s written efforts 
and diagnosis of his difficulties. In no other subject can the 
skilled instructor tell so accurately where the child’s mind 
is by looking over his shoulder at the figures being 
made.
-P-A-G-E-249
The Teaching of Arithmetic 241 
Class exercises in arithmetic. 1. Determined by nature of 
lesson. Classroom technique in arithmetic is determined by the 
nature of what is being done. If drill is the purpose, snap, 
vigor, accuracy and speed must be maintained; the numerous 
devices at the close of the chapter indicate the possibility of 
variety. So long as the judgment element is at a minimum as in 
ordinary drills or in solving a series of similar problems, an 
enjoyable semi-military procedure has a legitimate place. 
Concert reciting, if its limitations are recognized, may be 
effective. 
As soon as work is attempted which is dominantly instruc- 
tional, involving thinking, the classroom movement changes. 
Pupils may be no less interested but the motive is not so in- 
tense. The new’situation involves thought, always a wobbling, 
uncertain activity. While there may be an approach to uni- 
formity in drills, no two pupils think alike or at the same rate. 
With the most vigilant preparation and a perfectly organized 
lesson plan, unforeseen perplexities arise; what appears obvi- 
ous to one may be a hopeless obstacle for another. An expert 
supervisor can discover what is being accomplished; to the lay 
visitor, the more mechanically organized work of drill seems 
far more satisfactory. Even teachers themselves sometimes 
wonder where their work is going in an inductive instruction 
exercise. Both types of classwork, drill and instruction, need 
lesson plans; but the latter will not move according to any 
rigidly preconceived scheme. A higher degree of teaching 
skill is needed for energized instruction than for efficient 
drill. 
2. Blackboard arithmetic work. In much of the world, the 
blackboard is for the teacher; in America it is so much used by 
pupils in arithmetic, that in some schools they take it for 
granted that an arithmetic class means going to the black- 
board. Considering the necessary noise, dust, and lack of 
purpose of some of its exercises, it seems probable that less 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
  242 The Technique of Teaching 
pupil use of the blackboard in some schools would be a decided 
gain; in others more use should be made of it. The essential 
advantage of blackboard work is its socialized character; all 
may see what is being done; the one who needs help receives 
it from teacher or classmates; and when explanations are made, 
all may think together. 
The principal educational difficulty with blackboard arith- 
metic as carried on in many schools is its lack of individuality. 
The teacher too often dictates the same problem to all; certain 
leaders solve it independently; the rest copy the work of these. 
Exercises conducted upon this sleepy plane are characteristic 
of far too many schoolrooms. It is possible to make every one 
responsible through individual blackboard assignments and 
thus preserve the independence of properly supervised seat 
work, 
Devices for drill exercises. Many devices suggested for 
drill are of greater valué in keeping pupils somewhat pleasur- 
ably occupied than in contributing to mastery of number 
processes. This is especially true of motor activities based upon 
temporary conditions—writing figures on pictures of umbrellas 
during rainy weather or upon the picture of a tent on circus 
day—and of some of the weighing and measuring in primary 
grades, which is almost entirely upon the plane of manipula- 
tion. The fact that very little number work is involved does 
not condemn an exercise, but the teacher must be technically 
intelligent enough to know what is being accomplished. Make 
use of the devices described here or observe their use, and then 
estimate the teaching value of each:    
   
   
         
   
                          
    1. Counting exercises. At a certain stage children instinctively count 
steps, ticks of the clock, telegraph poles, posts of the chancel railing, any- 
thing to be counting; they like to count rhythmically either singly or in| 
concert. Use these devices in counting. (First and second grade.)

2. Diagram and constructive games. a. Building a stone wall (a device 
for beginners). A great number of elementary number combinations are 
placed upon the board. As fast as a pupil names the results at sight he may 
be said to have placed one stone in the wall. Another may take it down in 
the same way, erasing each stone as soon as he names the correct result. 
The “wall” may be already constructed, or the numbers arranged so that 
pupils can readily draw the “stones.” A section of the wall may look like 
the illustration which accompanies this description. The wall may be con- 
structed as seat work.

3. Geometric figure devices. Any number arrangement will serve for 
addition or multiplication. By care in placing the numbers the same devices 
may be used in subtraction and division. The number in the center is com- 
bined in some of the fundamental relationships with these on the outside,

a. Completing squares. Upon blackboard or sheets of paper, rule squares 
similar to those in the diagram at top of page 245. In the left side of each 
square place a combination upon which much drill is needed; in the upper 
tight hand corner print any number smaller than the sum of the other two, 
witha question markunder thisnumber. The first pupilcalled gives the sum 
of theleft hand column;the next names the number which if substituted for 
the question mark would produce the same sum in the right column. Such 
squares make profitable seat work, the pupil writing in the missing numbers.

  4. Motor games requiring scorekeeping. a. Bean bag. The scores assigned 
may vary with the combinations most in need of drill, and the outer ring or 
a designated space may call for subtraction. To increase the speed of the 
game, have a players’ line on each side of the goal, and let those who are out 
because of low score stand in the middle to return bags to players in turn. 
One or several may keep score, at the blackboard or in their seats.

b. Tossing and catching bean bag (or ball). Two pupils play at a time, 
ch catch counting 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or other number according to need of 
rill. When catch is missed, two other pupils take the place of those who 
re “out.” Since pupils are paired, premium is upon pitching as well as 
itching.

5. Finding combinations. a. Column and answer. Place on the black- 
board several columns of such examples as 
@) (2) (3) 
4+3> 2+ 2= ero eas 6+3= ¥ of 10= 5+6= 
Seas Gas 3X2= 
¥%of6 = 8+ 2= WmI—-4= 
Teacher, or pupil who is leading, says, “Find a problem in third column 
whose answer is six.” Continue setting tasks by naming column andanswer. 
b. Combination and answer. Place on the blackboard a series of com- 
binations separated by a vertical line from the answers which appear in 
2 72.153 miscellaneous order. The leader points to an 
6+3] 9 answer; pupils find a combination which will pro- 
74+719 duce the answer. If a long column of combina- 
3X3/14 tions and answers is used, considerable skill is 
‘4-— "|. 2 required to find the combination and answer 
9X1] 4 which correspond. 
c. Similar in plan to the preceding, except that on each side of the line 
are combinations. If the leader points to the combination 8 x 3 in column 
B, the one called upon should read a combination in column A which pro- 
duces the same result. As in the preceding, long columns add to the interest 
of the search,

d. Fox and Geese. Write on the board a very great number of elementary 
combinations in any kind of straight row arrangement; for example,— 
6.7 8 3.9 42:9 4 9 6 8 5. 7, 7..21 9.6 A” 23:25; 4, 1/6.10. 8 4.23.43. °2:.2 (6.8 8 a3gcc5 
The leader, or “goose” who may be a pupil or the teacher, begins by call- 
ing only results as 17, 8, 12 9 —— in any consecutive order, backward or 
forward, beginning at any place. As soon as any pupil or “fox” locates a 
“goose,” he names the results aloud, thereby catching the goose. If he makes 
no mistakes he becomes the goose. The same combinations may be used for 
multiplication, and series for subtraction and division may easily be written. 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
248 The Technique of Teaching 
6. Relay races between rooms, classes, or teams. a. Blackboard relay race. 
With all the combinations previously placed upon the blackboard on each 
side of the central goal but written in different order, the first member of 
each team at a given signal runs to the board, writing the correct result of 
the combination farthest from the goal. He then returns to his seat giving 
the crayon to the next in line, who proceeds with the next exercise. This 
plan is continued; the side reaching the goal first wins. 
b. Column relay race. Each pupil has large card upon which is recorded 
a number less than ten. The numbers for the teams are the same but in 
different order. At signal the leader of each team shows his card and calls 
his number. Each succeeding pupil in line shows his card and adds its 
number to the sum of those named before. The side first completing the 
addition correctly, wins the contest. 
c. Tally race. Place on the blackboard a tally sheet like theaccompanying, 
with as many pairs of numbers as there are contestants on both sides. Assign 
a number of examples to be solved, five perhaps 
, aid ; being given. The first one to complete all the 
8 examples places his paper on the teacher’s desk and 
3 is given the number one. The next two, the last one 
E ry i in the illustration receiving the number ten. The 
6— 5 number of correct examples handed in by a pupil is 
multiplied by the second number of the pairs as- 
z a ; signed to him. Thus the pupil who handed his 
site paper in first receives the number one; if he had five 
ae right, his score would be five times ten; if he had 
but one right, his score would be one times ten. The 
pupil who finished fifth would score thirty points if all his results were 
correct. The total number of points scored by a side determines the winner. 
This plan rewards both speed and accuracy. There is also no small amount 
of computation involved in reckoning scores. 
d, Race by rows. Leaders of rows place on the blackboard an example of 
prescribed length and solve it. While the contestants are busy all pupils 
move so as to leave the front seats vacant. If the first rivals have correct 
results, they occupy the vacated front seats. If a mistake is discovered 
the one making it must make the correction or solve another example. 
Those who take their places in the front seats after successful work are 
replaced at the board by those on the back seat, a shift of one place occur- 
ring each time an example is solved. The side or row finishing first, wins 
the contest. 
7. Individual contests. These may be conducted in a great variety of 
ways; the few which follow being merely suggestive. 
 
-P-A-G-E-257

a. Addition combinations. Contestants begin at each end of the series 
placed on the blackboard, as at A and B; the one who does the most of 
these correctly wins. (Subtraction, multiplication, or division combinations 
may be used.)

8. Arithmetic cards. A supply of these is indispensable, especially in a 
rural school where most pupils are of necessity without supervision much of 
the time. Card drills and games may be guided by teacher or by pupils; 
they may be used by individuals or by groups. Several kinds can be pur- 
chased of school supply houses, and variations to meet the needs of a class 
can be made by means of an inexpensive stamping outfit which should be 
part of every school’s equipment. 
a. Blackboard cards. Each card contains an exercise or problem; the 
pupil receiving a card goes to the blackboard and does the work indicated. 
The teacher who has a liberal supply of such cards has an effective resource 
for keeping quick pupils profitably busy while their slow companions per- 
form the minimum assignment. As a competitive device cards may be 
drawn from a central pack, each pupil being allowed to draw another when 
his work has been approved. The pupil who secures the most cards wins the 
contest. Blackboard cards may be easily made by clipping and pasting from 
old arithmetics. 
6. Flash cards. Cards may contain elementary combinations in the four 
fundamental processes, larger numbers to be added, subtracted, multiplied 
or divided, or other number operations which may occur to the ingenious 
teacher. The secret of success in flash card work is the snap and vigor with 
which it is conducted; inability to shuffle cards quickly is ruinous. If cards 
are so awkwardly manipulated that pupils in certain seats have an advan- 
tage or if the teacher must waste time looking at the card to determine 
whether an answer is correct, flash cards are not worth while. Cards should 
be of uniform size, of tough cardboard, and the content which pupils see 
should appear in small figures on the back of the card for use of the one 
conducting the drill. Attention to details insures successful card drills,

250 The Technique of Teaching 
c. Matching cards. Have ten cards containing the figures 0,1-9; ten 
containing the number words, one, two, three; and ten containing dots to 
correspond ., ., «, 2: A pupil called by teacher or play leader 
steps before the class, displaying his card. Those who have the correspond- 
ing figure, name, or dot card, respond by matching his card. 
d, Number cards. Each containing a number. Set should contain half a 
dozen of each from I to Io inclusive and as many plus, minus, times, division, 
and equality signs. 
e. Number tickets. Cards containing any incomplete number fact. Each 
pupil given the same number of cards. As soon as pupil has mastered and 
learned his card he returns it to teacher. The pupil or side giving up 
cards first, wins. Unless pupils are evenly matched and cards made by 
teacher who knows the advancement of each child, this game will hardly 
succeed, 
f. Domino cards. Dominoes afford excellent arithmetic play work. 
Better than the wooden dominoes are cards of about two by three inches, 
with the spots placed upon them by pupils, since these cards make little noise 
when they are dropped or turned upon the desk. The task of making these 
is in itself an exercise in accurate measuring and cutting. According to the 
advancement of the class the following uses may be made of them. 
(1) Lay them so as to have all the ones together. The twos, threes. 
(2) Finding all equivalents; e. g., five-three, four-four, six-two. 
(3) Matching ends, as when playing the regular game. 
(4) Each pupil in the class, in turn, places on the blackboard a figure, the 
other pupils finding the dominoes, the total spots on both ends of which 
equal the figure on the board. INANANDANDA 6

impressive means of showing the multiplication tables is indicated by the

252 The Technique of Teaching 
d. Give pupils the number 12,345,679. Ask them which figure they would 
like to have in the product. When they have named their choice give a 
multiplier nine times the figure they have selected. Suppose they say, “Let 
the product contain six.” In this case, the multiplier is 54. Fifty-four times 
12,345,679 is 666,666,666. If they call for 7 as the recurring figure, suggest 
63 as the multiplier; the product of 63 times 12,345,679 is 777,777,777- 
e. Similarly, though too long for frequent use, 1,122,334,455,667,789 may 
be used as multiplicand, 99 times the figure that is to recur as the multiplier. 
If the pupil says he wished the product to consist of fours, the multiplier 
which should be given is (4 X 99) 396. 396 X 1,122,334,455,667,789 = 
444,444,444,444,444,444. f. Guessing number. Write a number; double it; add 4; multiply by 
5; add 12; multiply by 10; subtract 320. When the pupil reads his result, 
the teacher disregarding the two right hand digits says, “Was your first 
number—naming the other digit or digits?” Suppose the number selected 
is 12; the result at the end of the series is 1200; the teacher says, “Was 
the first number you wrote 12?” 
g. Curious number arrangements and results which may be used for 
drill exercises.

10. Magic squares. Magic squares are peculiararrangements of numbers 
which show interesting symmetrical results when added. The study and 
making of these once occupied more leisure time of students than it does 
to-day, but they still possess a fascination for some. A few of the more sim- 
ple and interesting which may be used as means of securing incidental drill 
in addition and as a degree of entertainment for those who are not in need of 
drill are suggested. Once the pupil has the idea of the square as a series of 
consecutive numbers arranged to meet certain conditions, it is often possible 
to utilize the puzzle instinct to secure effort in building up the completed 
square when but part of it is given, as in a and b. 
a. Arrange the numbers one to nine in a magic square so that the sum of

any column of three figures is fifteen. Dependent upon the advancement of 
those to whom problem is given, suggestions like these may be offered; 
(1) 5 is the middle figure. 
(2) The middle column up and down is 7, 5, 3. 
(3) The diagonal columns are from top down 6, 5, 4 and 2, 5, 8 
(4) The lower two horizontal columnsare 9 5 I

Add this up and down, right and left, and criss-cross to see if all columns 
add 15. 
6. Arrange numbers one to sixteen in a magic square so that each 
column adds 34. This is probably the most interesting of all the simple 
squares. Among its peculiar features these may be noted. 
(t) Horizontal rows of figures added, equal 34. 
(2) Vertical columns added, equal 34. 
(3) Diagonal rows added, equal 34. 
(4) Any square of four figures added, equals 34. 
(5) The four corner figures added, equal 34. 
(6) The sum of any two pairs of numbers symmetrically placed with 
regard to the vertical or horizontal lines dividing the entire square into equal 
halves added, equal 34; e. g., 1 and 15 plus 8 and 10, 12 and 13 plus 7 and 2, 
or 12 and 15 plus 5 and 2.

EXERCISES 
1. The term mental arithmetic is usually employed to designate work 
performed without the use of peneil. Of course problems involving the 
actual making of figures take quite as much mental effort as the others but 
they are not exclusively without visible symbols. Mental arithmetic as 
such was formerly given a place in the daily program much more frequently 
than it appears to-day, and some think it should receive more attention; 
what is your opinion upon this question? Which of the following problems 
should a pupil at the close of the fourth, sixth, or eighth grade be able to 
solve without the use of pencil? 
a, A peddler bought 6 dozen oranges at 15c. a dozen and sold them at 2c. 
apiece. How much did he make on all the oranges? 
6. At 20c. a square yard, what will it cost to oil a floor 6 yd. long and 
4 yd. wide? 
c. Multiply 86 by 5. 
d. If you laya textbook that is 3/5 of an inch thick upon a note book 
that is 3/10 of an inch thick, how thick are the two together? 
e. Ina school of 220 pupils there was a decrease of 5% due to a change in 
boundary line of the district. How many were still in the school? 
f. Add 47% and 1%.

g. The number 85 is 15% less than what number? 
h. 330 divided by 15 =? 
4. A cammission merchant collected 60% of a debt and was paid 10% 
for collecting. What was his commission? 
j. The total weight of a $5 gold piece is 129 grains. It is 90% gold. Find 
the amount of gold it contains. 
k. If the latest frost in the spring at New Orleans is February 15 and the 
earliest in the fall November 15, what is the length of the growing season 
between frosts? 
J, Ina mixture of 64 gallons of water and 16 gallons of alcohol, what per 
cent is water? What per cent is alcohol? 
2. In the case of each of the following topics determine (a) whether it 
should receive any attention in the arithmetic course, (b) reasons for includ- 
ing or excluding it, (c) if included, approximately how many days should be 
devoted to it and the year of the course in which it is best presented, and 
(d) approximately what phases or aspects of the subject should be dwelt 
upon: 
Roman notation, 
The metric system. 
The equation. 
Constructive geometry. 
Study of foreign money tables. 
3. Real problems. Ideally it is best for pupils to be confronted with real 
situations in their number work. Of the following, which are real situations? 
a, Buying stamps with real money to place upon a real letter. 
6. Buying stamps for which the pupil does not care. 
¢, Buying stamps with toy money. 
d, Finding what stamps would cost if they were purchased. 
In general, the work of the school is of type (c) or (d), but alert teachers 
can often seize upon the pupil’s home environment to find examples of 
the first type. Make up five problems apiece for each of your pupils or 
have each make up his own list of such a nature that they shall involve 
actual transactions in which the pupil buys, sells, or handles money. To 
do this will necessitate using the actual names of local merchants or firms, 
current prices, measures commonly used in the community, and perhaps 
the dates of sale or purchases. 
Playing store is of the third type (c), but it may be given much of the 
reality of actual business. Pupils may cut paper money, giving each coin 
its value and imitating its appearance, toy money may be purchased, or
-P-A-G-E-264
  256 The Technique of Teaching 
actual money may be used. Price tags and marked-down sales are features, 
and standard weights and measures may be employed. 
Construct three self-checking examples based upon the community needs 
of pupils in your schools. 
4. Criticise or evaluate each of the following suggestions or statements; 
wherever possible illustrate by means of examples. 
a. Teach nothing in arithmetic that will have to be untaught. 
b. Omit what can be taught better at a later time. 
c. Never use and in reading whole numbers. 
d, Since pupils must ultimately learn long division, teach only this 
process from the first. (From instructions of a ward principal.) 
e. Teach processes before principles; pupils learn how before they learn 
why. 
f. Ifa blackboard problem is begun, it should be completed. There is 
little inspiration in filling a large space with figures, only to be told just 
before finding the answer, “Erase; time is up.” 
5. Discuss from the standpoint of scientific teaching each of the following 
situations which often occur in arithmetic classes, 
a. Insolving an example like “By purchasing an automobile a man saved 
fifty minutes a day; how much time would he save in two-thirds of a year?” 
the pupil after careful and perhaps accurate computation announces an 
answer like 2 years, 3 months, and 2 days. 
b. A pupil “analyzes” a problem in this way—“If a man can do a piece 
of work in five days, ten men can do it in ten times five days or fifty 
days.” 
c. A pupil erases his work from the blackboard saying, “I missed the 
answer a little, but I had the principle right.” 
d, “I have forgotten how to solve examples that look like that one.” 
e. “Shall we work these like the ones we had yesterday?” 
f. “I don’t know whether the answer is dollars or bushels.” 
6. All the examples in the following list are considered objectionable in 
some way though they are taken from textbooks, some of which are widely 
used. Select those which you think should never be used at all, giving your 
reasons. If any of the list appeal to you as being worth while, even for occa- 
sional use, state the specific purpose each might serve. 
a. George had XIII marbles and lost VII; how many had he left? 
b. If I had 13/16 of a dollar and spent half of it, how much would be left? 
c. If a boy runs a hundred yards in ten seconds, how long will it take for 
him to run a mile? ; 
d, Ifa horse trots nine miles in one hour, how many miles can he trot ina 
day of ten hours?

h. Mrs, Priedigkeit has $200 in the savings bank. The bank pays her 
4% of this sum each year for the use of the money. How much does the 
bank give her yearly? 
4. Find the convex surface of a cube whose edge is six inches. 
j. There were 7 farmers, 3 of whom drank rum and whiskey and became 
miserable; the rest drank water, and were healthy and happy. How many 
drank water? 
7. Of one of his teachers, Henry Ward Beecher related the following: 
If I gave as an excuse, “I did study it two hours,” he was sure to say, “That’s 
nothing to me. You need not study it at all or you may study it ten hours 
to suit yourself. I want the lesson.” 
It was tough for a green boy, but it seasoned me. In less than a month I 
had the most intense sense of intellectual independence and courage to de- 
. fend my recitations. One day his cold, calm voice fell upon me in the 
midst of a recitation, “No.” I hesitated,and then went back to the beginning; 
and on reaching the same point again, “No,” uttered ina tone of conviction, 
barred my progress. “The next;” and I sat down in confusion. He, too, was 
stopped with “No!” as I had been, but went right on, finished, and as he sat 
down, was rewarded with “Very well.” “Why,” I whimpered, “I recited it just 
as he did, and you said ‘No!’”” “Why didn’t you say ‘Yes’ and stick to it? 
It is not enough to know your lesson; you must know that you know it. You 
have learned nothing until you are sure. If all the world says ‘No,’ your 
business is to say ‘Yes’ and prove it.” 
Granted that this teacher’s purpose was commendable—to make his 
pupils positive and sure of themselves—do you approve his method? What 
is especially strong or weak about it? By what other means can the same 
Positive attitude be developed?

9. Awkward and even incorrect arrangements of written process or 
solution work is carried on in many schools. This is often due to tradition, 
teachers imitating the methods used in the schools they attended. A critical 
examination of written arithmetic upon almost any topic suggests improved.

10. Make a list of inaccurate statements found in arithmetic blackboard 
work during a week. What objection to allowing such work so long as it 
“gets the answer”? What are the specific gains of blackboard work as com- 
pared with seat work? 
11. To what extent is the arithmetic lesson an exercise in language? Ifa 
struggling pupil makes an error in speech, should the teacher 
a, run the risk of confusing his mathematical thought by correcting him? 
6. permit him to strengthen wrong habit bonds by allowing the incorrect 
expression to pass unchallenged? 
12. Some teachers insist upon unitary analysis or very full statements in 
explaining problems. In the following what advantage has either solution 
over the other? Which would probably be characteristic of the more ingen- 
ious pupils? Which is more painstaking? 
a. Problem. A boy received 48c. for picking sixteen quarts of berries. 
At the same rate what would he receive for picking thirty-two quarts? 
First solution, unitary analysis. If a boy received 48c. for picking sixteen 
quarts of berries, he would receive one-sixteenth of 48c. for picking one 
quart, or three cents. For picking 32 quarts he would receive 32 times 3c. 
or 96c. 
Second solution. If a boy received 48c. for picking 16 quarts of ber- 
ries, he would receive twice that much or 96c. for picking 32 quarts because 
thirty-two is twice as much as 16. 
b. Problem. Two-fifths of an acre of land cost $80. What would eight- 
tenths of an acre cost? 
First solution, unitary analysis. If two-fifths of an acre of land cost $80, 
one-fifth of an acre would cost one-half of $80 or $40, and an acre would 
cost 5 X $40 or $200. If an acre of land cost $200, one-tenth of an acre 
would cost one-tenth of $200 or $20 and eight-tenths of an acre would cost 
8 times $20 or $160. 
Second solution. If two-fifths of an acre of land cost $80, eight-tenths of 
an.acre would cost twice as much, or $160, because eight-tenths is twice as 
much as two-fifths.

c. Problem. If John has five red apples and William has four yellow 
ones, how many apples have they together? 
First solution, If John has five red apples and William has fone yellow 
ones, how many apples have they together? If John has five red apples and 
William has four yellow ones, John and William together have the sum of 
five plus four apples or nine apples. Therefore if John has five red apples and 
William has four yellow ones, together they have nine apples. 
Second solution. Five apples and four apples are nine apples. 
13. The following were given to pupils, the teacher remarking that al- 
though such work had no practical value, it would keep pupils busy for a 
time and give practice in division, subtraction, and multiplication. State the 
arguments to show that this was wise or unwise teaching.

14. A teacher wishing to enforce the lesson of arithmetical accuracy said, 
“In some subjects you can be partly right and partly wrong but your 
arithmetic exercises are always either all right or all wrong.” If this state- 
ment is to be taken literally a pupil who has a single figure incorrect even 
in a very long problem should be marked zero. In what sense was the 
teacher right? What is your practice in marking papers? Upon a scale of 
100% what credit would you give to an examination paper containing four 
correct answers and one in which a single figure was wrong. 
15. To develop the ideal of accuracy a teacher told the story of three 
boys who applied for a position in an office. The first was shown a wrong 
figure in an account and asked what he would do if he had made the mis- 
take. He showed how very skillfully he would erase it. The second used 
a very sharp knife to remove the figure. The third said, “That kind of 
mistake? I’d be ashamed to make it.” The last applicant was given the 
position. Find other stories to illustrate the value of not making mistakes. 
16. A high school pupil in contrasting the very moderate mathematical 
attainment of one instructor with the astonishing wisdom of another said, 
“Mr. A had us prove that theorem in just one way; Mr. B showed us seven 
ways. I tell you he isa gun in mathematics.” Then he added, “Do you know, 
after he had shown us all those ways, I got them mixed up and couldn’t do 
the exercise at all.” In arithmetic a similar situation occurs 
a, In teaching simple interest if the textbook presents several methods. 
b. In teaching most short cuts. 
c. When intelligent parents help children with home assignments. 
How may each of these teaching problems be met without confusing pupils?

17. Arithmetic short cuts are subject to several limitations. 
a, Many of the simplest apply to a small number of cases. 
b. Those which apply more generally are more difficult of mastery and 
require constant use to be of practical value. 
c. Since short cut situations occur irregularly and sometimes infrequently, 
as much time is wasted in determining which short method to use, or 
whether to employ any, as might be required to perform the operation by 
the longer process. Which short cuts are worth teaching in spite of the 
limits in their practical application? 
18. What topics in arithmetic were especially difficult for you to learn? 
If you have taught arithmetic, what was your success in teaching these 
topics? What can be done in teaching to obviate the difficulties you encoun- 
tered? 
1g. “I have no head for arithmetic,” says a pupil. What pedagogical 
significance should the teacher attach to this statement? Suggest specific 
procedure if the pupil’s opinion is due to 
a, Remarks of parents as, “None of my family are good in mathe- 
matics.” 
6, A succession of failures in his arithmetic work. 
c. Defective memory. 
d, Insufficient drill upon fundamentals. 
e. Inability to read. 
f. Laziness or lack of concentration. 
20. A set of examination questions given to a ninth grade class in Spring- 
field, Massachusetts, in 1846, was as follows: 
(1) Add together the following numbers: Three thousand and nine, 
twenty-one, one, three hundred and one, sixty-one, sixteen, seven hundred

The Springfield pupils (85 ninth graders) averaged 29.4% upon these 
questions; the eighth grade class in Springfield in 1905 made an average of 
65.5%. Give the same questions to an eighth grade class. So far as this 
evidence goes, are pupils as well taught in arithmetic now as in 1846? 
21. In an arithmetic published in 1514 occurs this problem which has 
appeared in many of the arithmetics since that time. In fact most books 
published during the nineteenth century contained some of the same class. 
What was their value? Why are they no longer published in our arithme- 
tics? 
Two women were carrying eggs. Said one to the other, “Give me two eggs 
and then I'll have just as many as you.” “No,” said the other, “give me two 
and then I'll have twice as many as you have.” The question is, “How many 
eggs had each?” 
22. In an arithmetic published in 1834 and widely used are many rules 
written in rhyme and intended to be sung. Rhyming rules and tables of 
denominate numbers were a common feature of arithmetic textbooks during 
the eighteenth century and to some extent to the middle of the nineteenth. 
Why did this device go out of fashion? 
“Sixteen drachms are just an ounce, 
As you'll find at any shop; 
Sixteen ounces make a pound 
Should you want a mutton chop. 
Oh, how delightful 
Oh, how delightful 
Oh, how delightful 
To sing this rule.” 
“Two pints will make one quart, 
Four quarts one gallon strong;— 
Some drink but little, some too much, 
To drink too much is wrong. 
Oh, how delightful 
Oh, how delightful 
Oh, how delightful 
To sing this rule.” 
(From Wilderspin’s Infant System, Sixth edition, London 1834.) 
23. Arithmetic textbooks should not be adopted until an intelligent 
study proves their suitableness for the class which is to use them. The only 
scientific and reliable procedure in deciding between a number of fairly good

books is the use of a scale for comparison. It is seldom possible to combine 
in one book all desirable qualities; the best printed book may contain the 
least satisfactory problems, or it may be too small or it may be too extremely 
devoted to a spiral or a topical organization. Certain characteristics may 
well be considered essential—no book being seriously thought of unless it is 
satisfactory in regard to these. Again, both indispensable and desirable 
characteristics are of unequal importance; the presence or absence of 
reviews has less to do with determining the fitness of a textbook than the 
readableness of its language. In making a scale for judging books “weight- 
ings” are used to provide for such differences in the importance of items; in 
this case satisfactory reviews might receive a rating of 10 points while 
suitable language would be entitled to 30, The following list includes most 
of the points usually considered in judging arithmetic texts; not all of these 
may appear to be necessary; on the other hand, others may need to be con- 
sidered. Using as much of the accompanying scale as seems effective and 
adding other items deemed essential, make a weighted scale with a total 
score of 100 points and score three arithmetic textbooks, of different series 
but designed for the same grades.

24. It is frequently claimed that children are impelled cityward in their 
interests because of city-made textbooks. To test the truth of the claim as 
applied to arithmetic, three books were analyzed by counting the problems 
contained in each, and classifying them as to their character.

Make a similar analysis of the book you are using. Is it a city book or a

25. The course of study in arithmetic has been changing, how rapidly 
it is difficult to determine. Some articles upon the subject unless very care- 
fully read, would convey the idea that most topics studied a few years 
ago are being discarded. New courses of study make much of the fact that 
obsolete material has been omitted; new textbooks frequently base their 
claims for adoption upon the amount they have left out. In such matters, 
there is not much in a name, for entire topics may nominally be omitted 
without significant change in the real content of the course, the same mate- 
rial appearing under a different name or differently organized. To illus- 
trate, a metropolitan newspaper made a great deal out of the fact that 
“mental arithmetic” had been dropped from the curriculum. The uncritical 
lay public which read only headlines doubtless believed that a very great 
change had occurred in that school system. A student of education who read 
critically even the newspaper statement of the case could see that the only 
change which had occurred was discontinuance of the mental arithmetic 
class and the omission of the subject from report cards and records of pupils; 
the amount of time devoted to mental arithmetic was not decreased but 
expressly recommended for continuance as an important phase of the regular 
arithmetic course. In pedagogical discussions of the same subject omissions 
are recommended “with the exception of ,” followed by a statement 
which includes all those phases of the omitted topic which well trained 
instructors have been teaching for many years. Thus when it is 
stated that Longitude and Time should be omitted, this is qualified by an 
exception or two, or it is recommended that whatever of this subject is 
regarded as essential should be taught in connection with geography. 
Another source of confusion is the inclusion for elimination of processes 
which have long since been almost universally dropped; Alligation is one of  
-P-A-G-E-274
  
266 The Technique of Teaching | 
these, a process which veteran teachers know only through reading the 
history of arithmetic, examining old textbooks, or consulting the diction- 
ary. Among thousands of normal school students, many of them experi- 
enced teachers, the writer has never found one who had ever used the 
process or seen it used, or had the faintest idea of its nature. Many other 
topics recommended for elimination have appeared in some modern text- 
books, but have received little or no attention by the majority of good 
teachers. In addition to changes which are more apparent than real there 
have been some real omissions. After reading the foregoing, answer the 
following questions based upon the accompanying table of contents clipped 
from the advertising matter of a newly published arithmetic: 
a. As printed how many topics or subjects are shown to have been © 
omitted? What per cent of the whole number of topics? 
b. How many of those marked as omitted had already disappeared from 
the arithmetic course when you studied the subject? 
c. Make an estimate of the number of days you spent upon the study of 
topics left out in the “after taking” list. About what would the total saving 
in days (arithmetic recitations) have been? What do you think should be 
done with the time thus saved? 
d. Of which of the omitted topics have you ever felt the need? 
e. Which of those marked for omission were so difficult that you never 
really mastered them? 
f. Which of the omitted topics do you believe should be retained? 
g. What topics not in either list do you think should be added?

27. Lesson plans in arithmetic are often directed toward the purpose of 
presenting brief but important new processes. Much of what appears in 
such plans when written out fully seems perfectly obvious, but unless the 
new work has been carefully thought out and planned there is likely to be 
waste because of unexpected situations and hastily improvised illustrations. 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
  268 The Technique of Teaching | 
The purpose of making or writing a lesson plan is to have freshly in mind 
what is to be done, the pupil’s probable reaction to each new condition, and 
the difficulties and wrong conceptions which may beset him. In the accom- 
panying examples, the answers which it is desired to elicit are given; others 
will often be called forth which call for discussion until essentially the cor- 
rect response is secured. After studying these, write similar inductive plans 
for teaching some process in fractions. 
a, Aim—to teach use of multiplier of two digits. 
Preparation—previously acquired knowledge or skill which will be re- 
quired in the new task—mastery of the processes of addition and of multi- 
plying by one digit. 
Presentation—the new process. 
Teacher and class solve a blackboard example, simple and typical, as the 
purpose is to fix attention upon the new process.

T. You know how to multiply by one figure; we are going to learn how 
to multiply by numbers of two figures. John, multiply by the 1, paying 
no attention to the 2. (Teacher may well hide the 2.) 
John multiplied correctly. 
. Where did John place the first figure of his product? 
Under the one. 
. And where are the other figures placed? 
They kept straight in line—below the one that is being multiplied. 
. The next thing to do is to multiply by the 2. Kate may multiply. 
Notice that I still place the product figure under the one I use in multiply- 
ing—under the two and keep the rest in line just as we usually do. Now 
we have multiplied by both; what do you suppose we do next? 
P. We add. 
T. Yes; Jane may add. What is the product? 
P. The product is 3003. 
Generalization—Teacher and pupils should then solve (2) and (3) and 
enough others to make sure that the new process is understood, 
T. What is new about these examples? 
P. Nothing except that there are two answers which have to be added. 
T. What do we have to be careful about? Sawn wAD

P. To get the second product started in the right place. It always begins 
under the figure we are multiplying by, and each figure has to be under the 
one we multiplied to get it. 
A pplication—practice. 
T. You may solve the examples on the board by the same method we 
have been using. 
b. Aim—to teach use of multipliers which include zero. 
Preparation—Skill in addition and in multiplying by one and two and 
three digits. 
Presentation—Solving with pupils two or three examples tike the accom- 
panying.

T. James may multiply by the 1. (He does.) Now what shall we do with 
that zero? 
P. Multiply it just the same as any other figure. (“Leave it out,” says 
another.) i 
T. Very well; Mary may multiply. (She does, the teacher writing the 
zeros.) 
T. Willie may now multiply by the two. (He does.) Kate may add. 
(She does.) Read the product, Harry. (He reads.) 
T. I wonder if we could get the same result without writing these zeros. 
Did the zeros make the answer larger or smaller? 
P. No; they are just nothings. 
T. Look at the work on the board carefully; didn’t the zeros make any 
difference at all? 
P. Yes, they made us put the second product over another place, but we 
could do that without the naughts. 
T. You may solve the example, setting the figures where you think they 
should be. (It is solved correctly.) (Several others are solved.) 
Generalization— 
T. Is there anything new about these examples or have we already had a 
rule which will serve? 
P. We have already had it; all you need to do is to start each product 
under the figure you are multiplying by. 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  
270 The Technique of Teaching 
P. No, it’s different. Whenever there is a zero in the middle of the multi- 
plier, it means you have to set the product over two places instead of one, 
T. What would you do if there were two zeros in the multiplier—like 
2004 perhaps (writing this on the blackboard)? 
P. That would just move the product by the 2 over another place still. 
T. Then perhaps the old rule about writing numbers under the multi- 
piier figure in multiplication will still work. Now what are we going to 
remember about examples which have a naught or some naughts included 
in the multiplier? 
P. That the first figure of each product must be written under the multi- 
plier figure just used and that if there is one naught this means to set the 
product figure over two places.

CHAPTER SIX 
THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
Definitions of history. The definition of history which one 
accepts is important in formulating his actual teaching aims. 
A study of accepted purposes clears the educational issues 
involved in a greater degree than would be the case in con- 
sidering definitions of formal subjects. Those given here are 
not so much to be accepted as to be discussed, and the teacher 
may find it worth while to collect other statements of great 
thinkers upon the nature and purpose of history. 
“History is so much of past experience as abides in race 
memory.” 
“History is a record of man’s struggle for better things.” 
“The history of man is that of overcoming difficulties and the 
measure of greatness is in the manner of overcoming them.” 
(Tagore.) 
“History investigates and relates the facts of the evolution 
of humanity as social beings in causal connection.” 
“The true object of history is to show us the life of the 
human race in its fullness, and to follow up the tale of its con- 
tinuous and difficult evolution.” (Frederic Harrison.) 
“It should be the aim of history to bring the past into rela- 
tion to the present, and to show how historical ideas and experi- 
ences are being constantly projected into the present, are in 
fact the controlling forces in our social and industrial life.” 
(McMurry.) 
The function of a 1. Only remotely practical. By 
those who have considered history as past politics and politics 
as present history, the subject has been taught to princes and 
those who are to be rulers in order to “put old heads on young 
271 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
  272 The Technique of Teaching 
shoulders;” but this conception of history, as a series of exact 
precedents used to determine a course of action, ignores the 
fact that the same situation never occurs twice. If A is the 
historical event, then A + x (something unknown) is invari- 
ably the present problem with which we must deal. We no 
longer believe in the kind of history which enabled Thales to 
predict a series of bountiful olive crops and which brought him 
riches through a monopoly of the olive presses. 
Only in the most general sense does knowledge of history 
make it possible to predict the course of events. Even the far 
more determinate natural science can much more reliably pre- 
dict annual rainfall than determine whether the Fourth of July 
will be rainy. Much less definitely does history forecast human 
events—because they are human and for that reason not sub- 
ject to such laws as science has been able to discover. 
If the past be considered a determining force, we should be 
able to predict the future. If we regard the past as past and 
without further consequence, we should be without the guide 
known as experience. But “the past is not a force as rigid as 
destiny unless we make it so” (Maeterlink), and “the content of 
a well stocked mind is the product of thousands of years of 
accumulation.” (Robinson.) “It is an obsolete illusion to sup- 
pose that history supplies information of practical utility in the 
conduct of life, lessons directly profitable to individuals and 
peoples; it is also an error to say that ‘the distinguishing 
feature of history is to be good for nothing!’” (Langlois- 
Seignobos.) Though history has no laws, and is cited to prove 
both sides of every controverted question, to justify opposed 
religious and political propaganda, and to support every 
utopian scheme and pseudo-science, we are usually not willing 
to entrust our political destinies to persons who are ignorant 
of the past. 
History is a mode of explanation of the past. Through it 
such terms as the “solid south” or the Monroe Doctrine are
-P-A-G-E-281
  The Teaching of History 273 
given meaning. When we speak of practical values, we are 
referring to intangible though not less real phenomena. The 
historical stories of the Bible have exercised influence for three 
thousand years, but no one stresses their practical worth. Pub- 
lic opinion which is at foundation full of historical background 
is not exactly what the man of the street calls practical, but it 
makes democracy possible. Whether the stories which tell 
our national history and form our popular ideals are those of 
Bismarck, Garibaldi, Washington, or Lincoln makes very prac- 
tical differences in the character of citizens, in their dealings 
with each other, and their attitude toward their own govern- 
ment. Such important but remotely practical purposes does 
history serve. 
2. History is liberalizing. Travel is properly considered a 
liberalizing influence, and knowledge of history implies travel 
in far countries and remote ages. Bigotry and intolerance dis- 
appear in the expanded sympathy and widened horizon of one 
who knows the world of the past. If it is true that the human 
animal is an incurable gossip, there are advantages in widening 
‘the field of conversation. Even unproductive talk about the 
national election or a rebellion in the antipodes is better than 
what is understood by the phrase “talking about the neigh- 
bors.” The meanness and pettiness of personal backbiting is 
hard to duplicate in discussing characters known only through 
the reading of history and of the newspapers. Apart from this 
rather negative service which history renders, a truly liberaliz- 
ing effect, if it is taught in a large way, is socialization, the 
development of the we feeling and growth in capacity to act 
together. 
A phase of its liberalizing function which has not received 
sufficient recognition, is freedom from the tyranny of one idea 
which acquaintance with history brings. The ignorant citizen 
knows that democracy is the best form of government; the one 
who has read history says, “That depends upon the intelligence,
-P-A-G-E-282
| | | 
, | 
274 The Technique of Teaching | ‘ 
integrity, and stability of the citizenship.” The dangerous 
radical is one who has but one idea and is fanatically devoted to 
its realization; a knowledge of history tempers confidence in 
one-idea solutions of great human problems, and brings the 
attitude expressed by Carlyle, “If the blind lead the blind, bet- 
ter at times sit still.” Indeed, historians as a class have been 
accused of being philosophical and pessimistic, inclined to 
watch the human procession pass, without advocating or even 
admitting the possibility of real human progress. Whatever 
may be true of those who devote a lifetime to history study, 
there is no doubt that the modern world greatly needs the 
steadying influence which more widely diffused knowledge of 
history would bring. 
Patriotism and moral values. History enlightens patriotism; 
it is preéminently the citizenship subject. The emotion of 
patriotism is primal, akin to the feeling of an animal for its 
home; in this sense a cat is patriotic. The danger to democracy 
is not in the weakening of this instinctive, inert type of patriot- 
ism, but in ignorance and indifference. The patriotism problem 
of the schools is to inspire the toiler, after his day’s work, to 
interest himself in the local election or in national problems 
instead of spending all leisure in pursuit of pleasure. Citizens 
of autocratic countries may respect their governments without 
comprehending or loving them. Our patriotism must be strong 
and intelligent enough to respect the government when it is 
understood, and it cannot be justly averred that we have 
solved this problem. The English wag who “could get along 
with his country well enough were it not for his countrymen” 
was an eighteenth century patriot like some thousands of 
Americans whose patriotism does not take them to the polls on 
election day. They are too self-centered to be annoyed by the 
social, economic or political questions which trouble their 
fellows. Next to the imitation of a living model in the person of 
one who embodies active patriotic or other moral qualities is  
-P-A-G-E-283
  The Teaching of History 275 
the influence of suggestion from reading the right biographies. 
“Moral impulses and dispositions are cultivated by giving the 
opening mind of the child a chance to admire and approve right 
actions in the lives of others. In studying the lives of men, we 
pass moral judgments and pass them with fervor. The feelings 
and incentives aroused pass over into moral convictions which 
influence our later actions.”! The best history is not written 
for the purpose of painting a moral, but history’s lesson 
cannot be taught without promoting positive moral values. 
Disciplinary values. The mental discipline to which history 
best lends itself is that of training judgment, and is involved in 
solving problems vicariously. Discovering the important evo- 
lutionary truth that nothing comes out of nothing, pupils learn 
to think of cause and effect, of action and reaction, and to look 
for these. Sifting and evaluating evidence is an important part 
of the school’s task in developing judgment. If a recorded 
event contradicts our tested experience we reason that the 
record is untrue. Sometimes the alleged occurrences of history 
are forced to give way; in other cases it appears that partial 
knowledge of mental factors accounts for our wrong judgment. 
For example, men exposed to certain degrees of privation, ex- 
posure, or danger should perhaps be expected to lose their 
morale and run away; but the power of some ideal makes them 
fight and win. The victory should be to the strong, but history 
is full of examples in which the strong appeared to be the weak. 
Beginning in the lower grades, opportunities for exercise of 
judgment may be devised in such lessons as the following sug- 
gested by Johnson: ? 
The teacher asked pupils how they -knew there are any 
Chinese. One had heard of them, another had read about them, 
and a third had seen them. The value of each kind of evidence 
was thoroughly discussed.

276 The Technique of Teaching 
A little farther along stories from such sources as Herodotus 
offer a field for the beginning of critical study. After reading 
a story, ask how near the time of the recorded incident the 
narrator lived. What were his opportunities for learning the 
facts? Was he accurate or inclined to exaggerate? Were there 
any reasons why his account might be unfair or one-sided? 
Children do not become unduly skeptical as a result of such 
exercises but they do learn how difficult it is to observe closely 
and tell the exact truth. A challenging, sanely critical attitude 
is a serious need of this newspaper headline age. 
Course of study. 1. The significant and typical included. 
It must be assumed that only the important and typical 
will find a place in the history curriculum. Viewing the events 
of history as social practices devised to overcome difficulties 
in the way of attaining things people consider worth while, 
it is evident that the better have superseded the worse, 
and the mere fact that a movement or event has occurred and 
its history is therefore true does not make it worthy of general 
study. 
It will also be agreed that ideas and ideals are more signifi- 
cant than details or events, since they continue. The descrip- 
tion of a mob or skirmish may be of compelling interest but the 
motives which impel the struggle are of greater consequence. 
It makes less difference exactly where or when the Pilgrims 
landed than that they brought with them certain ideas. 
2. Biography in the curriculum. Nevertheless the begin- 
nings of history for children must be concrete and personal. 
The great man theory of history has to give way ultimately to 
the evolutionary study which may account for and analyze 
the great man, but to pupils in the intermediate grades, his- 
tory is a succession of biographies in which each character 
is noted for one great trait, event, or achievement. Richard of 
the Lion Heart is always crusading, Charles the First is ever 
having his head cut off, Washington is solely occupied with
-P-A-G-E-285
  The Teaching of History 277 
telling the truth or fighting the British. When Carlyle com- 
plains that “science destroys wonder and substitutes mensura- 
tion” and claims that the “history of the world is the biography 
of great men,” he is speaking the language of most pupils in the 
grades. They are thrilled by the deeds of Indian fighters, of 
the world’s military leaders, of the “women and children first” 
heroes of the Titanic, or by the story of the physician who 
gave his life to demonstrate the cause of yellow fever. The 
adult conception that there are no perfect characters, and the 
attempt to see every great leader in true and therefore full per- 
spective is foreign to pre-adolescent years. 
In choosing the biographical material which it is assumed 
will constitute the course during primary and intermediate 
grades, nearness_and_ remoteness in chronology is prone to 
deceive. These pupils do not raise the objection of the high 
school pupil, “What do I care about people who have been 
dead five thousand years more or less?” and from the stand- 
point of understanding, nearness of experience is what counts. 
“Properly edited historical materials from the Old Testament, 
Herodotus, Thucydides, Tacitus, Froissart, and a long list of 
others are psychologically nearer to this age than is the last 
election.”! Braddock’s defeat is more readily comprehended 
than modern warfare, and the duel between David and Goliath 
is much closer to the pugnacity of a little boy than is either. 
3. Lack of historical continuity in American courses of study. 
History courses in the United States have been peculiar in that 
they lack continuity with the historical past of the civilization 
to which we belong. History courses in France or Germany 
are continuous from Charlemagne and the classical world. 
Medieval history is French or German history. Ancient history 
finds the beginnings of these modern countries. 
The fundamental traditions of our civilization are the same 
as those of western Europe but to find them we must study the 
1Hall, G. S—Educational Problems, Volume II, 290.
-P-A-G-E-286
278 The Technique of Teaching 
past of other nations. Magna Charta is as truly a foundation 
of our constitutional freedom as it is in the structure of English 
government, but to read its story we must study the history of 
a foreign country. We owe our national existence to war with 
this same country, but since our early settlements found Indian 
wars far more important than they now appear, we made the 
study of Indians the first chapter in our country’s history. In 
studying the Indian to whom we owe almost none of our tradi- 
tions and development, we have ignored our European 
antecedents too much. 
4. Present tendencies in history curriculum. For many 
years the first European contacts usually came from the high 
school which few pupils reached. The Committee of Ten 
(1893), whose report strongly influenced history courses for 
two decades, placed Greek and Roman history in the eighth 
grade and biography and mythology in grades five and six. 
The Committee of Eight (1905) recognized the necessity for 
more European background for American history in grades 
six and seven. In grade seven the New Committee of Eight 
(1919) deals with world history before 1607, and continues 
world history since that date in grade eight. The entire 
recent tendency is to recognize that our history is vitally re- 
lated to the rest of the world. In time Indian stories will 
doubtless take their place as of value in illustrating a stage of 
civilization rather than as significant in the history of modern 
America. Our history can be sufficiently American without 
sacrificing our unity with the rest of civilization. 
Phases of history teaching. 1. Drill. History as a content 
subject is not usually thought of in the field of drill. We cannot 
do history; we know or enjoy it. The development of skills 
required in formal subjects is unimportant here, but much 
must be remembered. Vividness of presentation with the 
accompanying intensity of attention may insure recall, for 
Emerson is right in saying that attentien is the stuff that
-P-A-G-E-287
  
The Teaching of History 279 
memory is made of. This applies to large phases. When it 
comes to remembering dates and sequences so often service- 
able to the student of history, the laws of learning in habit 
formation situations apply much as they do in mastering diffi- 
cult orthography. (See pages 42 and 43.) 
2. Instruction. History is primarily an instruction subject 
involving knowledge, reasoning, and judgment. Most situa- 
tions may be usefully classified as (a) narrative or (5) interpre- 
tative or psychological. The narrative must be well told and 
interesting and above all truthful, since the last quality alone 
distinguishes history from legend, myth, or fiction. These 
qualities, with skill in use of means to make presentation im- 
pressive, should insure the imagery which is the appropriate 
reaction to all live teaching of history. 
The second phase of history instruction, the interpretive, is 
shared by but one other common school subject, literature. 
Interpretation necessitates application of psychology. Two 
equally interesting and vivid stories may contradict each other 
or cross fundamental human emotions when, as has been 
shown, necessity for application of judgment arises. Sometimes 
the pupil’s standards of judging are shown to be inadequate. 
When he is brought to this kind of situation, skilled teaching 
allows him to weigh evidence, suspend judgment, and form his 
own. new conclusions, which are to make part of the recon- 
structed world which fruitful study of history is to make for 
him. 
3. Appreciation. As in literature, appreciation is a vital 
factor. The term must be accepted in its proper sense of esti- 
mating justly, for approval and condemnation of historical 
characters must both be accorded. The pupil who has learned 
to admire heartily the great characters of whom he reads has 
an incentive for reading more. An important purpose of teach- 
ing history is to inspire pupils with an interest in its continued 
study as it appears in current periodicals and in biographies of 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
280 The Technique of Teaching 
our leaders. Well written histories approach in beauty of form 
the classic of literature. In memorizing such poems as The 
Star Spangled Banner appreciational value is as great as pa- 
triotic significance. 
Place relations in history. 1. Importance. In the organi- 
zation of history for teaching purposes every event and move- 
ment has a physical basis; everything occurred in some place. 
It is not possible to reduce all historical movements to the 
result of physical conditions, but no intelligent pupil can long 
study history without forming general notions of the relation 
of climate, configuration, altitude, and distance, to the course of 
historical events. He may, for example, observe that the 
history he studies is limited mostly to the temperate zones; 
he may with Emerson discover that “where the snow falls 
there is freedom,” and in time he will learn that the dominant 
cause of nearly all wars is the problem of food-getting, itself 
determined by physical conditions. 
2. Necessity for use of maps. Few pupils are able to carry 
a mental map of place relations. Some schools are ill equipped 
with maps, but this is due to the fact that very few teachers 
make use of maps. Occasionally map and chart equipment, 
which should be in a room especially devoted to history, is 
scattered and inaccessible. One of the strong points in favor of 
departmental teaching is that it specializes equipment as much 
as it does teaching. Teachers who have been educated in 
meanly equipped schools imitate their instructors in doing 
without maps, even though a supply is provided; they have 
formed the habit of doing without. And last of all, a few teach- 
ers have so clear a picture of place relations that they feel no 
need of maps and wrongly take it for granted that their pupils 
need no such helps. 
Any supervisor can recall instances of teachers whose failure 
to use maps reflects no credit upon their skill in instruction. 
A high school inspector demanded maps in a school as a con-
-P-A-G-E-289
The Teaching of History 281 
dition for accrediting. Returning a year later he found the 
principal seated in the shadow of a high priced map, blandly 
teaching without it; the use of maps was not part of his teach- 
ing habit. A county superintendent finding no use being made 
of a fine case of maps proposed to use them in a history exer- 
cise. Brushing off the dust from the case the teacher said, “The 
case is locked, and the key is down at my boarding place.” 
A teacher excused her failure to use maps upon the ground that 
she was not in her regular classroom, and that blackboard 
space was abundant and a few lines would have made the lesson 
as clear as the highest priced map could have done. When 
teachers make full use of maps in history, school officers will not 
be slow in furnishing them. 
Maps present historical situations in clear outline because 
they make place relations diagrammatically concrete. Ideally 
the most serviceable is the blackboard outline map, conven- 
iently enough arranged so that the features needed can be 
quickly sketched, leaving out details which contribute nothing 
or may even detract from what is under discussion. If a liberal 
map equipment cannot be supplied, series of charts showing 
contemporary conditions at every important era are of 
great value. Nearly every history textbook is supplied with 
more maps than teachers and pupils use effectively. Wall and 
blackboard maps have the advantage of focalizing attention of 
all upon the same material. 
Time relations. 1. Gradually comprehended. Historical 
content may be of no great significance unless located in time. 
Before, after, and during are notions which must develop in 
advance of those like a long time ago or a hundred years ago. 
Children gradually appreciate long intervals through experi- 
ence; they may even be conscious that time relations and dates 
constitute the necessary frame work of the historical structure. 
Graphic comparisons and charts have value for those pupils 
who perceive all relative magnitudes diagrammatically. If an
-P-A-G-E-290
  282 The Technique of Teaching 
inch line represents the pupil’s age, perhaps a foot may indi- 
cate the time since 1776. 
2. Learning dates. a. Not many required. If proper rela- 
tionships are established in causal sequence, not many dates 
need be mastered. Except in relation to occasions nationally 
or locally commemorated, exact dates, as naming days of the 
week or month, should not occupy time and effort. Pupils 
quite generally dislike dates because they have no meaning 
and are accordingly hard to remember. A few, like 1492, 1776, 
and 1860 may become vital, outstanding, and of as great emo- 
tional appeal as the names Columbus, Washington, or Lincoln 
with which they are associated. 
6. Learned by drill. The few dates which all need to re- 
member, must be learned as thoroughly as the fundamental 
combinations in arithmetic, and by application of the same 
laws of habit formation. In spite of convenient associations 
and mnemonic aids, several dates have to be acquired by an 
absolute act of memory. Until a considerable knowledge of 
history is achieved, there is about the same scope for reasoning 
out 1588 or 1607 as important points, as in arriving at 3 + 
4 = 7 bya process of judgment. Until a few centers of chron- 
ology are fixed, the most perfect causal chain has no point of 
beginning. 
c. Date posters. Economy in learning results from posting 
dates either upon the blackboard or upon specially designed 
posters. Pupils learn quite incidentally in the time devoted to 
looking about casually, seeing whatever falls within the range 
of vision. Posters may be made as artistic as the work of the 
drawing period permits. Planning a series of such posters is an 
excellent project, involving discrimination in selection of im- 
portant dates, use of proper wording, tasteful color and design, 
and exactness of execution. 
A list of such posters, which were made in a drawing class, 
is given: picture of chained negro, legend—“Emancipation
-P-A-G-E-291
The Teaching of History 283 
Proclamation, 1864;” picture of ship, legend—‘“Fulton’s Cler- 
mont, 1807;” picture of three ships, legend—“Armada, 1588” 
(A similar poster could be used with the legend—“Columbus, 
1492”); picture of prairie schooner, legend—“Gold Rush, 
1849;” picture of telegraph pole and wires, legend—“Morse 
telegraph, 1844;” picture of early type of locomotive, legend— 
“Railroad, 1831;” picture of early settler, legend—“Jamestown, 
1607.” 
Continuity. In organizing history for teaching purposes, 
the evolutionary attitude rather than the static is to be pre- 
served. This means that events are to be viewed as causes and 
results, not as occurrences. The naive idea so dear to some 
teachers of finding the first or the greatest has occasional value 
but, in general, superlatives in history are to be avoided. The 
great lesson that out of nothing, nothing comes, that all has 
evolved from earlier institutions, leads to organization in larger 
units and to tracing historical development. A series of lessons 
becomes a continued story instead of detached fragments. The 
results of one war may appear to be the cause of the next. 
The long story of human progress when understood shows 
variations, hesitations, irregularity, but no breaks. 
Suggestions for history assignment. 1. Motivation. Motiv- 
ation in the history assignment is best insured through problem 
setting. Questions like, “In these circumstances, what would the 
colonists do?” are better than an exclusive repertoire of When? 
Where? or Name. And in setting forth the circumstances out of 
which the problem is to arise, a situation must often be con- 
structed as the culmination of a series of exercises. As has been 
shown, the problem question itself may be a description or 
narrative by the teacher, ending with a formulated problem. 
A great difficulty with history is its seeming remoteness. 
This is at the same time a characteristic of the greatest value, 
since it enables us to see in clearer outline events with which 
we are not connected and toward which, therefore, we do not
-P-A-G-E-292
  284 The Technique of Teaching 
take prejudiced attitudes. Devices for making history realistic 
can be utilized to advantage, but, of course, nothing can take 
the place of the enthusiasm of the teacher. 
2. Making clear what is to be found. A related function of the 
assignment especially important in history is making clear 
what is to be looked for in the study of a lesson. Being required 
to find what is in a five page assignment leaves most pupils to 
flounder helplessly; few know what to look for. This may at 
first be remedied by telling pupils specifically what to discover, 
but they should gradually be led to read so intelligently that 
problems will be discovered after conscious search. 
Indefinite references are the mark of ineffective assignments. 
To say, “There is a book in the library which tells more about 
that” is only a degree worse than “Look in these books and see 
whether you can find anything about the lesson.” No teacher 
of pupils or students below college rank has the right to assign 
material which he has not read, and definite pages are not hard 
to specify. The incentive value of specific page references has 
not been discovered by many teachers. The same attraction 
which causes pupils to apply their energy to solution of arith- 
metic problems, will carry a history pupil through long lists. of 
references, provided that they are definitely measured in pages 
and are not too long. : 
The study period. 1. Problem attack. To be most effective, 
the study period must continue and reinforce the problem- 
setting nature of the assignment. The project, continued sev- 
eral days and involving perhaps the solution of many prob- 
lems, is a form of study which may result in extended use of 
references and a thorough study of a larger unit than the 
ordinary lesson is likely to involve. Preparation for a debate 
is a project which enlists the most active codperation from 
leaders. If the class is small or if the speakers are chosen from 
the entire group shortly before the debate is to occur, all may 
participate. 
 
-P-A-G-E-293
The Teaching of History 285 
2. Concentration difficult in history. The study period pre- 
sents opportunity for waste in history where the assignment 
does not take hold. Though the subject may deal with the 
most stirring events, the pupil very often finds it hard to con- 
centrate. There is first of all the textbook difficulty. In no 
other subjects are there usually so many unfamiliar words per 
page. Even though proper names are not the cause of trouble, 
their presence deflects from the interest of reading. It may 
prove enlightening to the teacher to make now and then an 
oral reading exercise out of a history lesson. Light may also be 
cast upon children’s study troubles by asking for lists of un- 
familiar words in the assignment. If the number is consider- 
able, only blundering reading is possible and close application 
is improbable. 
3. Pupils prefer action phases of history. We have long been 
told that our textbooks give too much attention to wars, and 
this is doubtless true, but military events are at least exciting 
and hold attention. Not a few children are like the seventh 
grade pupil who said, “I don’t care anything about the causes 
of wars; I want to read about the fighting.” The record of 
martial deeds brings the thrill of an adventure story. Most 
children are not at first much concerned about causes or re- 
sults; they want action. A taste for the more important though 
vastly more abstract motives back of the world’s great strug- 
gles must be acquired. It is this fact which has led some to 
insist that children cannot study real history at all. No one 
need be alarmed at the interest, especially of boys, in the de- 
tails of the more savage phases of history; but until attention 
has been successfully enlisted in more fundamental aspects of 
the historical narrative, the study problem has not been solved. 
4. Pupils made conscious of method in study. Pupils usually 
are not systematic or resourceful in analyzing their own study 
procedure though it is not safe to generalize upon this point 
with too great assurance. A large group of pupils who were
-P-A-G-E-294
  
286 The Technique of Teaching 
asked to tell how they studied history, made the statements 
following this paragraph. These do not indicate a comprehen- 
sive study technique, but almost any pupil will gain by making 
a similar study of his own efforts. Class discussion of the study 
problem is worth while even where supervised study technique 
is not attempted. 
How Some Pupils Study History 
I read the lesson over. 
I read about it in the other books. 
I look up words I do not understand. 
I make an outline of paragraphs and look up each topic. 
I put myself in the place of one of the characters in the lesson. 
I shut my eyes and think of it as a picture, one scene at a 
time. 
I locate in the geography places mentioned. 
I imagine myself the teacher and ask myself questions. 
5. Written work in the study period. The written work of the 
study period needs supervision and, in many schools, reduction 
in amount. To the docile and industrious but unthinking pupil 
who copies references into notebooks without being perceptibly 
wiser, the wisdom of learning a little instead of writing much 
is to be insisted upon. “Don’t copy that; just think it out or 
remember it,” is needed advice. Some excellent teachers would 
be even better if they would resolve to teach without notebooks 
for a few months. This would bring home forcibly the function 
which notebooks are, or are supposed to be, performing. So 
long as pupils feel that they are making a useless book for the 
teacher, there will be the unconscionable copying found in too 
many schools. When the teacher’s skill is great enough to make 
pupils feel a pride in their notebooks, these become purposeful 
and usually worth while. 
Vivifying media. 1. Relics, collections, and museums. His- 
tory is reinforced by every relic or fac-simile from a distant age.  
-P-A-G-E-295
  ” The Teaching of History 287 
The tattered flag, the old sword or gun, the Indian arrow- 
head, or the old coin, lend reality. The fortunate few who 
live near large museums may have such material in abundance 
but nearly every community can furnish more tangible evi- 
dence of the past than teachers often find. The printed 
Declaration of Independence gains new meaning after a 
reproduction of the original is seen, with John Hancock’s 
as the boldest signature. 
2. Excursions and pictures. Excursions to places of great 
historical importance are likewise possible in very few com- 
munities, but pictures, albums, and stereographs make an 
excellent substitute, sometimes possessing the advantage 
of being detached from the irrelevant and trivial which may 
be encountered in an excursion. For example, at varying 
ages, a dog fight, a glaring bill board, or a ball game may 
appear as the most noteworthy features of a visit, even to the 
most sacred of shrines. 
3. Historical novels, diaries, and talks by old settlers. The 
historical novel, if it portrays the life of its times accurately, 
gives color and setting to the events and characters of history 
for upper grade and high school pupils. The writing of diaries 
as they might have been written in 1775 or at other times when 
events which have become historically famous were being 
enacted gives reality. A talk by an old citizen who has par- 
ticipated in events recorded in our school histories adds an- 
other means of giving reality to history teaching. 
4. Dramatization. Dramatization in history is far more than 
an entertaining game when guided by skilled leaders; at its 
worst it is little more than a name for a rather disorderly 
way of wasting time. Its great value is in making more vital 
the vicarious experience of pupils in becoming temporarily 
the persons they represent. No elaborate costumes or dis- 
guises are necessary for ordinary class work, but these have 
great value for the special occasions in which pupils delight.  
-P-A-G-E-296
  
288 The Technique of Teaching 
The teacher who purposes to lead a class in dramatizing 
historical events must have plans well in hand. Writing of 
the play, planning of acts and scenes, selection of characters, 
and discussion of costumes may then have genuine historical 
value. Once the plan has been successfully employed a few 
times, dramatic possibilities are not hard to discover. Sug- 
gestions for a dramatization are offered below: 
A—Story of Columbus 
Scene I. Columbus as a boy. 
Scene II. At the Convent of La Rabida. 
Scene III. Before Queen Isabella. 
Scene IV. The voyage. 
Scene V. The discovery of the new world. 
B—Columbus at Court of Spain 
Characters—Columbus, Isabella, Ferdinand, priests, at- 
tendants. 
Classroom suggestions. 1. The textbook in the history 
class. With a large number of teachers whose knowledge 
of history is very slight, too extensive dependence upon the 
textbook is characteristic. “One book” teachers these are, 
who cannot know their one little book because they know no 
other. Such teachers cannot honestly go before a class without 
so thorough a knowledge of the one book that they can do 
without it. A safe rule would be to allow pupils the open book 
whenever the teacher must lean upon book support. 
In fact something may be said in favor of occasional open 
book exercises as opposed to an unvarying succession of lessons 
beginning “Close your books.” History is to be discussed 
as much as it is to be remembered, and intelligent con- 
sideration may be promoted by explaining the text oftener 
than quoting it. In such exercises pupils may succeed without 
remembering a great deal but no one can escape doing some 
thinking.
-P-A-G-E-297
  The Teaching of History 289 
2. Questioning in relation to preparation. Closely related 
to the inadequate preparation of the one book teacher, is 
awkward and ineffective questioning, nowhere more apparent 
than in history teaching. Technically correct and stimulating 
questions are not to be constructed upon the inspiration of 
the moment, and they certainly will not be devised by those 
who must oversee the efforts of several studying groups 
while a half dozen in the history class are the center of in- 
structional effort, the usual situation in one room schools. 
A large number of teachers would gain in teaching skill by 
writing, for a time, all their proposed questions and giving 
the exact answer for which each question calls. 
3. Variety in method and device. “Books closed. What: (e 
When ? Where——? Take the next five pages,” represents 
a daily procedure among teachers who are not resourceful. 
In addition to improving questions, which has already been 
discussed, lessons may be written occasionally. Deliberately 
thought out and well framed answers may be secured without 
harmful sacrifice of spontaneity by having pupils read the 
answers which they have written to a series of questions. 
Blackboard exercises; a question box used now and then, each 
pupil furnishing one or several questions, this dependent 
upon the size of the class; debates; allowing pupils to ask 
questions which the teacher is expected to answer; and pupils 
conducting class work as in the socialized recitation next 
considered are all useful diversions. 
4. Socialized history recitation, A chairman may be ap- 
pointed or elected from a list of eligibles. To be chairman 
at all is an honor. To equalize participation in a degree, the 
teacher may hand the one who presides a list of pupils who 
are backward or do not force themselves into the foreground. 
The accompanying suggestions provide for variations in 
conducting socialized work. Like almost any other school 
procedure this plan loses effectiveness as soon as it is entirely   
  
 
-P-A-G-E-298
  290 The Technique of Teaching 
standardized. One reason why. socialized procedure is es- 
pecially applicable in the history class, is the wide opportunity 
for expression of independent opinion which the subject 
presents. 
a. If no great central problem is found, the lesson may be 
divided into several parts, a leader being provided for each. 
Each leader is responsible for outline, full information, and 
questioning upon his part. 
b. If the pupil leader leaves out essential content, the 
teacher must sometimes ask questions or offer suggestions. 
c. Pupilscontribute discussion, corrections, and information. 
d. A pupil may be challenged as to any statement he makes 
and must be ready to defend his contribution. 
e. A secretary may keep minutes; each pupil writes a 
summary; one pupil at the blackboard makes a summarizing 
outline. 
f. A critic may be appointed for the day. His function is 
to point out the excellencies and deficiencies of the entire 
period. He may for example make corrections of inaccurate 
statements or incorrect language, watch closely the degree 
to which contributions are relevant, and mildly censure pupils 
or class for wandering from the subject. 
Current events. 1. A difficult teaching problem. Because 
recent and contemporary history is so complex, it is far harder 
to teach and to understand than the story of events remote 
from the present. It is difficult to organize, and without con- 
sistent organization results are accidental and uncertain. 
Unguided in their choice of events, pupils are lost, or select 
the sensational and trivial. The little school papers designed 
for the study of current events, useful as they are, must be 
made cheap in order to circulate, and they cannot compare 
favorably in style or appearance with the higher priced papers 
for adults. Racial, political, and religious prejudices make 
teaching a problem in some communities.
-P-A-G-E-299
  The Teaching of History 291 
2. Current events related to citizenship. In spite of its 
difficulties, the teaching of current events is too important 
to be omitted. No other study is half so effective for guid- 
ing pupils’ reading. They will read newspapers and magazines 
after school histories are laid upon the shelf. The modern 
force known as public opinion will be sound and effective in the 
degree that our citizens are fair-minded, discriminating, and 
able to act upon or resist suggestions in their current read- 
ing. So long as democracy has citizens able to say “No” 
as well as “Yes” to the presentation of public questions as dis- 
cussed in the columns of this newspaper age, free government 
will be a success in spite of sensational or radical journalism. 
3. Suggestions upon teaching current evenis. a. Use of 
periodicals. If a periodical is used, its more important articles 
should be made the basis of as definite assignments as if the 
material were found in a textbook. The lesson needs to be 
previewed, difficulties cleared up or put in the way of being 
understood, and problems set up. In general, definite days of 
each week devoted to current material will secure most satis- 
factory results, but no schedule should be so rigid as to prevent 
discussion when interest is most keen, or to make impossible 
the motivation which may inhere in a stirring event or a 
generally celebrated anniversary. If the school maintains 
current event film service or if a large per cent of pupils attend 
moving picture shows where current happenings are featured, 
the class discussion of events thus. made vivid may well occur 
while pictures are fresh in mind. 
b. Limiting the field. Since the world of events is very 
wide, and looking at everything usually results in seeing noth- 
ing, the lost feeling of pupils may be relieved by appointing 
individuals or groups to be responsible for different fields. 
Of the many divisions possible, a few are suggested. 
(1) European news. This might be further classified as 
English, Russian, French, or other states,
-P-A-G-E-300
  292 The Technique of Teaching 
(2) News of the United States outside our own state. 
(3) News of our own state outside the local community. 
(4) Local news. 
If this plan is followed, each will have opportunity to 
present something of his own. There will be no complaint of 
not knowing what to look for. 
c. Use of bulletin board. (1) A current history bulletin 
board stimulates reading. All that is needed is a sheet of 
heavy paper tacked upon the wall or in some other way placed 
within easy reach of all. Each writes opposite his name the 
subject of the current event he has chosen, provided it has 
not already been selected by a classmate. The entire board 
is made the program for discussion once a week, and a new 
sheet is then posted. 
(2) A similar plan for older pupils who have access to a 
library is to post all names in a list, requiring each to read 
an important article each week or month, writing the title 
and reference opposite his name, no two pupils being allowed 
the same article. This plan has the merit of familiarizing 
pupils with many periodicals which is part of the purpose 
of teaching current events. Children from magazine and news- 
paper reading homes usually read; the school must increase 
the proportion of such homes. 
d. Vocabulary and dictionary study. Each room and each 
pupil should keep a list of current words, phrases, or terms 
which it is agreed all must understand in order to be intelligent 
citizens. There is no more fruitful way of increasing experience 
and vocabulary. The plan reinforces the dictionary habit. 
The degree to which moderately intelligent persons toss 
about terms commonly used in their reading, satisfied with 
wrong or inadequate comprehension, is illustrated by the 
accompanying, taken from an examination given to young 
men in military training, who were of freshmen college rank, 
while every newspaper was filled with accounts of the greatest

war in history. Students were asked to define a list of terms 
one of these being salient, 
Salient 
(1) The ally of any warring nation as England is the 
salient of France. 
(2) The division of an army. 
(3) A place which is well fortified—usually a hill. 
(4) Attacking forces. 
(5) Means a division of the firing line. 
(6) A battle field where many of the recent battles have 
taken place in the north. 
(7) One division or flank of the army. 
(8) As used in the present war, a patcn of ground grouped 
around a certain place. 
e. Citing authority. A decidedly important by-product 
of current events exercises is the habit of giving authority 
for news items. The vague “I saw it in the paper,” is closely 
akin to irresponsible gossip founded upon mere rumor. It 
is not too much to expect pupils in the grammar grades to 
consider the sources of news, and to note the differences 
between reliable and unreliable, impartial and biased, accurate 
and exaggerated accounts. When authority is cited in written 
work, the name of the periodical, its date, or volume and page, 
should be given. 
f. Continuity developed gradually. In the nature of the 
subject, an outline cannot be projected far in advance, and 
pupils seldom have the historical background requisite to 
show that each seemingly detached event is part of a great 
continued story. Making a class study of events related to 
some important current problem, and then keeping up with 
developments, and relating current topics to regular work of 
the class, will increase unity. After all, we must be satisfied 
with a fragmentary knowledge of the world-wide field, knowing
-P-A-G-E-302
  294 The Technique of Teaching 
that if the pupil continues in school, he will in time find the 
fragments explained. 
Civics. 1. Changed ideals; civics and civil government. 
Not many years ago civil government was taught logically 
and systematically, and exclusively in the upper grades. 
The theory of our national government was consistently set 
forth. The rationale of our procedure assumed that if pupils 
were properly instructed and understood our government, 
the school had done its part. 
But in the general challenge of modern institutions, and the 
recent insistent demand that everything shall function, the 
older plan has been found wanting. It has not secured effec- 
tive interest in good citizenship nor produced law abiding 
citizens ready to codperate for community betterment. Pupils 
taught in the usual way do not understand the outline of 
our government too well, and they are decidedly lacking 
in comprehension of its actual meaning to citizens, and often 
in the fundamental virtues of citizenship. 
We now believe that citizenship depends upon training 
as much as upon understanding. The best guarantee that a 
pupil will be the right kind oftcitizen is the fact that he occupies 
with credit his place in the microcosm of society we call the 
school. The duties of citizenship are those of the Ten Com- 
mandments and the cardinal virtues, defined and practiced in 
relation to present problems. “The average citizen must be a 
good citizen if our republics are to succeed. The stream will 
not permanently rise higher than its main source of national 
power, and national greatness is found in the average citizen- 
ship of the nation.” (Roosevelt.) 
The development of adequate habits and ideals of citizenship 
depends upon three phases of school activity: participation 
in the conduct of the school itself, coming into relationship 
with the community of which the school is part, and re- 
ceiving systematic instruction in the principles and organiza-
-P-A-G-E-303
The Teaching of History 295 
tion of government. All of these are present throughout 
the pupil’s school experience, but the last, which may be called 
civil government rather than civics and civic training, is 
especially characteristic of junior high school and: senior 
high school years. Each of these phases of the problem will 
be considered. 
2. Citizenship through participation in school activities. 
Civic education through participation is not a process of 
instruction but a mode of living. Being part of a well-governed 
school of high morale promotes the ideals of citizenship. Open- 
ing exercises managed by a pupil committee, codperative 
projects whose purpose is improvement of school premises, 
the socialized recitation and pupil self-government, not only 
have a training value but are illustrative of citizenship duties. 
Participation in the conduct of school and playground activities 
is direct, concrete, and continuous in meeting present needs in 
all grades. Properly surrounding pupils with the needs of pres- 
ent growth best guarantees the right kind of adult citizenship. 
If ‘‘the needs of present growth” is interpreted liberally 
and sanely, not to confo m to childish whims, but to a modern 
world which is very large, complex, and artificial in its de- 
mands, the dependence placed on participation will justify 
itself. If, however, we accept something like the naive view 
expressed by one enthusiastic teacher that ‘‘if every one prac- 
ticed the golden rule we should need no government,” or that 
taking an honorable part in school activities and playground 
games insures the developing of intelligent citizens, we shall 
be making the mistake of tarrying too long upon the con- 
crete, with the usual result of depending too much upon the 
local and trivial. The opening years of life in democratic 
society assuredly should be spent in a democratically con- 
ducted school where pupils become capable of self-determina- 
tion, guided by the force of inner control as opposed to external 
compulsion, but they demand also instruction in the larger 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
  
296 The Technique of Teaching 
relationships of community and nation. Some of the more 
important of these cannot be dramatized, played, or par- 
ticipated in. 
3. Community civics. a. Aims. Study of the local com- 
munity makes vital contact with civic responsibilities. 
The future must see greater emphasis than has the past on 
studies of community life and community needs. And the term 
‘community’ must not be narrowly defined. The course of study 
must be enriched to include intensive study of our nation and its 
meaning to our citizenship and to the world..... The enrich- 
ment of the course must aim consciously at the destruction of 
those provincialisms and class prejudices which have worked in 
the history of nations in the past, counter to the interests of democ- 
racy. Ignorance of other tasks than one’s own breeds lack of sym- 
pathy and results in separation of group from group. Intelligence 
regarding others brings with it sympathy and codperation.! 
The aim of community civics is to help the child know his com- 
munity—not merely a lot of facts about it, but the meaning of his 
community life, what it does for him and how it does it, what the 
community has a right to expect from him and how he may fulfill 
his obligation, meanwhile cultivating in him the essential qualities 
and habits of good citizenship. 
The good citizen may be defined as a person who habitually 
conducts himself with proper regard for the welfare of the com- 
munity of which he is a member, and who is active and intelligent 
in his codperation with his fellow members to that end.? 
b. Difficulties and suggestions. (1) The local approach 
to civic problems is for most teachers a difficult matter. 
“Study your community” and “Consider the health problem 
of your city” are more easily written into a course of study 
than made effective in teaching. There is, first of all, themonot- 
onous familiarity of it all. Pupils are not at once made en- 
thusiastic about their prosaic office-holding neighbors whom

mentary School Journal, XXVI, 316.

  The Teaching of History 297 
they have known and about whom they have gossiped. 
There is little of the awe-inspiring majesty of the law about 
a health officer or justice of the peace in a small community. 
(2) A second difficulty of community civics, which will 
disappear when its function and teaching technique are better 
understood, may be attributed to its present chaotic course 
of study. Of the various approaches to the subject usually 
suggested, the local health situation is most often seized, 
perhaps because both teachers and pupils have secured most 
of its content in sanitation and hygiene courses. The com- 
munity health problem in some schools is presented in much 
the same way in half a dozen grades. Pupils are not likely 
to take seriously what has to be presented so frequently that 
it becomes tiresome. Unless the teacher knows accurately 
and in greater detail than the usual course of study indicates, 
what is being done in all grades, this type of vain repetition 
is sure to occur. 
(3) A third difficulty is that of analyzing the complex 
situations of a modern community sufficiently to discover 
organizing centers in relation to which the work may be given. 
Each of the accompanying is a useful topic, capable of great 
expansion. If these are arranged in an order which insures 
timely consideration without the useless repetition to which 
attention has been called, the list may prove helpful.

Recreation Corrections 
Education How government agencies 
Civic beauty are conducted 
Wealth - How government agencies

-P-A-G-E-306
  298 The Technique of Teaching 
(4) A fourth serious problem arises in relation to the 
degree in which pupils should endeavor directly to bring about 
changes in community conditions. In the older plan of teach- 
ing civil government only, such questions as the proper length 
of the president’s term or how supreme court justices might 
be removed could be debated fervently without objection 
from any quarter, since the most intense interest in these 
great questions could have no direct effect upon anyone’s 
business or mode of living. When issues of street cleaning, 
or enforcing laws to prevent near-gambling devices are in- 
volved, the matter is different. Pupils may easily take a 
stand which, if producing action, would destroy their parent’s 
means of livelihood. The city council may be found wanting 
or other officers may be negligent of their duties. In case of 
actual conflict, the forces which stand for the right in any 
community may be depended upon ultimately; but most 
communities are not easily stirred to action. It is not wise 
to make an attack until the situation is thoroughly under- 
stood, and the opportunities for achieving something have been 
intelligently estimated. The right in municipal matters is 
not infrequently an elusive goal; what appears to be lax law 
enforcement may be due to the lack of the adequate funds 
needed to enforce the law. Teachers who incite school pupils 
in any ward to start a crusade for new playground facilities 
should know beforehand that there exists some possible way 
in which the problem can be successfully solved. Unintelli- 
gently antagonizing important community forces accomplishes 
nothing. 
(5) When it comes to securing the materials of local his- 
tory and government, many home publications soon prove 
to be unreliable. Such reading needs skillful direction if it is to 
increase reverence for the truth or respect for local officials, 
but the resourceful teacher is usually able to select what is 
worth while and to find old newspapers, local histories, and
-P-A-G-E-307
  The Teaching of History 299 
occasionally pioneers whose stories personally told may justly 
increase community pride. Like the local newspaper in which 
our personal interest is likely to be out of all proportion to 
the significance of its items, local civics has a direct appeal 
but leaves unprovided a more remote and abstract knowledge 
of our government, in important phases of which we cannot 
be neighbors. 
4. Instruction in civil government. Systematic instruction in 
civil government, as opposed to civics based upon school 
activities and study of local affairs, should be part of every 
pupil’s experience. The nature and purpose of democracy, 
and the problems of our national government need more 
effective attention than they have ever had. In both history 
and civics we are exposed to the danger of not paying sufficient 
attention to the political phases of our life. “Talking politics” 
in the minds of some persons is a term expressive of waste 
and indicative of a certain lack of intellectual caste. We 
constantly hear of the necessity of eliminating the evil in- 
fluence of politics from various governmental functions; 
but we shall never be free from politics in a democratic 
society. 
The remedy for politics in its bad sense is more intelligent 
and more general interest in politics. How to vote wisely 
is no longer a matter of concern to boys only. All pupils 
need to realize that the subject of politics is the most important 
item of conversation for every citizen. What the Greek 
philosopher said about the penalty of indifference to politics 
being the dominating of the better by the worse is as true 
now as ever. 
The study of civil government must be closely correlated 
with that of history. As the study of the history of our country 
is of more value than acquaintance with local history, how- 
ever interesting, so the constitution and government of the 
United States merit far more attention in the upper grades
-P-A-G-E-308
  300 The Technique of Teaching 
than do those of state and local governments. For a citizen 
of the state not to have read his own state constitution is 
hardly a matter of great reproach; not to know the United 
States constitution and the Declaration of Independence is 
a confession which citizens of our democracy should be ashamed 
to make. A loyal and sympathetic understanding of the 
government of the United States is the great function of civil 
government courses. The thoroughness and system of the 
old plan of teaching is still needed, but it is to be built upon 
several years of civic training in the lower grades. 
EXERCISES 
1. Accepting one of the well-known formulations of the aim of education, 
such as social efficiency, adjustment, or complete living, select the function 
of history which you approve most fully of those at the opening of this 
chapter and show how its realization contributes to achievement of the 
educational aim. How does the study of the careers of Aaron Burr, Robert 
Fulton, or John C. Fremont help to fulfill the aim of education? 
2. By illustration or otherwise, prove that each of the following state- 
ments is true or untrue. 
a. History increases knowledge of one’s self. 
b. History teaches moral laws. 
c. No one really understands history until he has grown up. 
d. “No sensible teacher asks how many facts he is to teach. No two 
teachers—if good ones—would teach the same number of facts to the same 
pupils or class, and much less to different classes. No sensible teacher asks 
what kind of facts he shall teach, expecting to receive in answer a tabula- 
tion of his material. He knows that general rules accompanied by suitable 
illustrations are the only useful answer to these questions.” (Indianapolis 
City Course of Study.) 
e. “If the history teacher is to be successful, he must learn the same 
lesson as his colleagues in geography and biology. The chronological 
method of teaching history must be discarded if it proves not to be the 
psychological. ... It may prove to be better to follow up a line of interest 
than to follow the calendar.” 
f. “One fault with the efforts to train for citizenship has been that of con- 
centrating attention too exclusively upon the citizenship that children are 
to enjoy and exercise in the future, to the neglect of the citizenship that they
-P-A-G-E-309
  The Teaching of History 301 
are now experiencing and enjoying. A result of this is that our methods 
have been those of filling the mental storehouse for future use, instead of 
those of cultivating a growing plant. The gardener is of course concerned 
with the crop he is to get at harvest time, but he knows that the best way, 
the only way, to assure that crop is to provide the plant with nourishment 
that it can use in its present growth. The skillful teacher has come to see 
that attention to the needs of present civic development affords not only 
the material for instruction and practice within the field of the child’s experi- 
ence and interests, but that it is also a sufficient guarantee of the civic 
insight needed in the future.” (Bulletin, 1918, No. 1; Massachusetts State 
Department of Education.) 
3. As an example of the necessity of using judgment in relation to inter- 
pretation of historical causes, classify as traditional (historical) or psycho- 
logical the following reasons given by recent writers to account for the 
present dislike of doing farm labor or household service. 
a. Farm labor means exposure in all weathers, 
b, Farm laborers were the serfs of the middle ages. 
c. The Bible implies that manual labor is unworthy in, “In the sweat of 
thy face shalt thou eat bread.” 
d. Ability to do manual labor requires very little training; hence it is a 
common possession. 
e. Farm and other manual labor is not “clean” work. 
f. Manual labor is not highly remunerated. 
Is the attitude toward manual or farm labor due to historical causes 
which may pass away, or to psychological factors which would soon restore 
the attitude if it disappeared? 
4. What is the value of dates in the teaching of history? A study of the 
relative importance of dates in American history ranks the first ten in 
order as 
a. 1776 f. 1803 
b. 1492 g. 1861 
c. 1607 h. 1787 
d. 1789 i. 1863 
e@. 1620 j. 1820 
If you do not agree with the selections or the order, substitute others, 
giving reasons for your choice. 
5. Account for psychologically, justify, condemn, or explain the peda- 
gogical significance of each of the accompanying classroom occurrences 
during history exercises. 
a. In describing the position of an army or a historical battlefield located
-P-A-G-E-310
  302 The Technique of Teaching 
in the community, a teacher said, “The general had his tent near the present 
site of the new tobacco warehouse. Children, how many kinds of tobacco 
are there?” The pupils named several kinds of tobacco after which discus- 
sion of the battle was continued, nothing further being said about tobacco. 
b. A pupil in all seriousness said, “New York was taken by the Duck of 
York before Pennsylvania was settled by the Quackers.” The same pupil 
stated that Lord Baltimore founded the colony of Maryland, intending to 
build an asylum to keep a persecuted religious sect in. 
c. Teacher: “What views would Alfred the Great take of universal 
suffrage and popular education if he were living now?” 
Pupil: “If King Alfred were still alive he would be too old to take any 
interest in such things.” 
d. Teacher: “Give three reasons for believing that Columbus dis- 
covered America.” 
Pupil: “You said so, the book said so, and I heard it before I started to 
school.” 
e. Teacher: “Please close your books and don’t let me see one open 
again. The history class is no time to look at a map. You should have 
looked at the map before class.” Then the teacher edged over near the 
window to get better light upon her own textbook with its map. 
6. Criticise, evaluate, or try some of the following plans used by teachers 
of history and government: 
a, The day after election pupils went to a regular polling place and cast 
their ballots with unused tickets. Judges and clerks of election were 
appointed and upon duty as in the regular election. 
6, “During the next week, each pupil is asked to find out something new, 
something of historical interest. Try to learn something not widely known; 
ask parents, grandparents, or neighbors. Write down exact and complete 
facts, in correct and interesting form. On local history day we shall read 
these stories.” 
c. For review a “Who’s Who in America?” history match may be con- 
ducted. After sides are chosen, pronounce the names of prominent his- 
torical persons or events. Each in turn must identify his word or be 
counted out. 
d. For an occasional exercise, conduct one word examinations. If 
mimeographing is not possible so as to give each pupil a copy, questions 
may be dictated, leaving out the test word pupils are to supply. The 
accompanying illustrate the plan. 
(1) The Dual Alliance was entered into by ........ and 
mainly for protection against ........ A

(4) There are three great divisions of our national government, 
eee aeematc 3 fihe Sock pa OO as ee 
e. During the study period each pupil makes complete outline of the 
lesson. One of the outlines is placed on the blackboard and used as the 
basis of discussion. Criticism of the outline is part of the class exercise. 
f. A European method; no textbook used. 
(1) Teacher dictates brief summary including excellent out- 
line of lesson. Pupils copy this verbatim in notebooks. 
(2) Books laid aside; teacher explains and amplifies the sum- 
mary. 
(3) Pupils summarize in their notebooks what the teacher has 
said. Two or three such explanations and summaries are usually 
made in a class period. 
(4) Next lesson instructor holds individual conference with 
each pupil and examines the notebook. Pupils must explain it 
definitely and clearly. 
7. It has been suggested that pupils may usually be interested in debat- 
ing historical questions. To be debatable these must be clearly stated and 
offer the possibility of argument on each side. After noting the accom- 
panying examples, formulate three debate questions suitable for grammar 
grade pupils. 
a. Resolved, that French aid saved the colonies from being subdued by 
the King’s army. 
b. Resolved, that Greene did more to help the American cause than did 
Lafayette. 
c. Resolved, that the President should be elected for six years instead 
of four. 
d. Resolved, that the Indians have been fairly treated by the whites. 
8. A seventh grade pupil prepared a paper upon a history topic and 
handed it to the teacher who said, ‘‘Are there any misspelled words in it?’’ 
“T don’t know.” ‘Take it back; when you do know, hand it in again.’’ 
The same pupil handed a history paper to another teacher with the remark, 
“I was in a hurry and so I am not sure whether I spelled all proper names 
right.” ‘That's all right; it doesn’t make much difference how they are 
spelled,’”’ said the teacher. What reasons can you give for approving or 
condemning the course of either of these teachers ?
-P-A-G-E-312
304 The Technique of Teaching 
g. Criticise these questions asked by history teachers. What is speci- 
fically wrong with each? 
Tell of the Treaty of Paris. 
How were the governors—kind or cruel? 
General Greene had command of what army? 
Was it Caesar in command or Pompey? 
Was this the only council or were there others? 
What about Perry’s victory? 
to. A class of student teachers was asked to formulate ten questions, 
each upon a history lesson. The words with which the questions started 
were as follows, numbers indicating frequency: Se An Ss 
What 54 Name 7 When 2 
Give 17 Why 6 Where 2 
Explain 12 Tell 4 Compare 2 
Discuss 10 Who 3 Which I 
How 10 Define 3 Others 14 
What criticism of the character of questions indicated? In preparing 
your questions during a week, limit your use of the initial words in the first 
column to not more than ten per cent of questions asked. Aside from the 
inconvenience this causes, what effect has it upon your teaching? 
11. Make an outline of what you think an eighth grade pupil should 
know about the causes of the Mexican War. Write a brief lesson plan for 
teaching this unit of subject matter. 
12. Discuss the value of each of the accompanying suggestions for 
teaching current events: 
a. At the opening of the term assign each small group of pupils one of the 
following problems for community study during the year. The pupil or 
group acts as a committee to whom everything relating to its problem is 
referred, 
Better roads 
Playgrounds 
Advertisements 
Amusements 
Church life 
Living expenses 
Educational facilities 
Health 
b. Have each member of class buy a newspaper, clip all news items, then 
exchange or trade around, each having a permanent topic.
-P-A-G-E-313
  
The Teaching of History 305 
c. Have each pupil select a topic for detailed consideration. Read or go 
through every article bearing upon the subject in 
one number of a quarterly magazine. 
two numbers of a monthly magazine. 
eight numbers of a weekly periodical. 
Make a correctly arranged bibliography of these articles; make a brief 
outline or summary of all which do not repeat content. 
d. A full list of terms which persons of intelligence should understand in 
their general reading would be a valuable possession, as it would enable 
members of the class to focalize upon the mastery of such terms. Ask each 
to be on the lookout for such terms. Institute a contest by posting new 
terms discovered with the name of the discoverer. The first one handing 
in is given credit for his item. Words, phrases, slogans, and quotations may 
well be included. The beginning of such a list follows: 
(1) balance of power 
(2) radicals 
(3) sympathetic strike 
(4) two power naval standard 
(5) protectorate 
(6) forty-four hour week 
13. Write a paragraph—one or two hundred words—descriptive of each 
of five periodicals suitable for use in teaching current history. Find who is 
editor and something about him, how long the periodical has been pub- 
lished, what kind of news it reports best, and determine by examination for 
what grade of pupils it is best suited. 
14. Since newspapers and periodicals are important means of influencing 
public opinion, it is of interest to know where they are published and the 
extent of their circulation. How many are published in your state? What 
is the circulation of the largest? What is the circulation of the most widely 
disseminated weekly? Is it an influential publication? 
15. A brief survey of the current reading of pupils in any school or 
system is easily made and very much worth while. It will not be a strictly 
accurate index of reading habits since some will forget, others will list all 
the periodicals of which they know the name, and others will omit a few, 
of which they are ashamed. Most pupils are truthful and will respond in 
the right spirit if told not to sign their names with the list they submit. 
Without previous announcement, distribute cards to all pupils or in all 
rooms above the third grade, asking each pupil to list the papers and 
magazines he reads when he has time. Collect the cards, tabulate the 
results, and draw educational conclusions.

16. It has been suggested that a collection of local relics and other his- 
torical material would be worth while. What are the possibilities in the 
community where you are teaching ? 
17. A writer on education has suggested these as reasonably expected 
attainments in ability to study history at the close of grade eight. 
a. Ability to use simple reference books and to interpret historical maps. 
b. To study assigned lessons from an outline. 
c. To outline for themselves lessons which are fairly well organized in 
the textbooks. 
Formulate your own standards of pupils’ ability to study and an esti- 
mate of what they should know in history at the close of grade eight. 
18. Educational measurements and scales in history thus far devised 
resemble ingeniously planned series of examination questions rather than 
scientifically developed tests of the results of teaching. What are the 
peculiar difficulties involved in determining accurately the effectiveness of 
instruction in history ? 
19. A prominent teacher of history lists these characteristics as pecul- 
iarly essential for all who are to teach history. What others would you add? 
Broad general education. 
Bigness of views. 
Sympathy for pupils and for characters studied. 
Non-partisanship in current matters. 
Spirit of frankness, sincerity, and justice. 
Enthusiasm for the subject. Se

  CHAPTER SEVEN 
THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
A difficult subject. There is general agreement that geo- 
graphy is a difficult subject to teach. Many handle the subject 
well and are enthusiastic about it, but they recognize that 
its teaching technique is not easily acquired. The writer 
has encountered many instructors who consider spelling, 
arithmetic, reading, or history easy to teach. Some, to be 
sure, are satisfied with wretchedly inadequate results, but 
whether they do well or ill, geography teachers seem to think 
their work a uniquely difficult undertaking. 
Reasons for unsatisfactory results. If there is general 
agreement that geography is badly taught and the subject 
more frequently than any other is called the sick man of the 
curriculum, there is little unanimity in opinion as to the reason 
for unsatisfactory results. Divergent aims with no common 
understanding of what is being attempted, abstractions for 
which pupils have no background in experience, insufficient 
time, too much place geography, not enough place geography, 
unsuitable textbooks, and incompetent teachers are the 
reasons most often given, though it is evident that several 
of these could be applied equally to other subjects. 
Undoubtedly the actual causes of results which have so 
generally seemed indifferent are inherent in the subject itself. 
Its content has elastic and elusive boundaries. A large share 
of its important subject matter changes very rapidly. The 
local and regional is properly of greater import than in any 
other subject, though a large share of this may have only 
local significance, and it is exceptionally easy to waste time 
308

upon this trivial material, most of which would inevitably 
be learned in due time quite incidentally. 
Accepted definitions of geography. Though lack of agree- 
ment as to purpose is not the cause of our confused status 
in geography teaching nor even a condition peculiar to this 
subject alone, a study of well stated aims will contribute to 
a more consistent and fruitful procedure. The accompanying 
statements of aim are from writers who have given the best 
formulations of their thought after rich geographical exper- 
ience. 
1. Geography is the interpretation of the earth’s surface 
and its climate and their relation to life. 
2. Human geography may be defined as the study of the 
relation of geographical environment to human ac- 
tivities. 
3. Geography treats of the earth as the home of man. 
4. Geography is a description of the surface of the Earth 
as the Home of Man. 
5. Geography is the exact and organized knowledge of 
the distribution of phenomena on the surface of the 
Earth, culminating in the explanation of the inter- 
actions of Man with his terrestrial environment. 
Comparing these, it may be noted that in spite of variety, 
there is little of contradiction among such statements. In 
fact these typical definitions are strikingly alike, as a tabulation 
of the essential content of each readily indicates. 
1. Meaning—earth’s surface and climate—relation to life. 
2. Study of—geographical environment—relation to human 
activities. 
3. Treats of—earth—as home of man. 
4. Description of—surface of earth—as home of man. 
5. Knowledge of—distribution of phenomena—interactions 
of man. 
By any of these definitions, natural features which can have  
-P-A-G-E-318
310 The Technique of Teaching 
no consequence for man are not legitimately to be studied 
as geography. In the plethora of material of possible sig- 
nificance to someone, the problem is that of selecting what 
is of most worth—not merely what is true, interesting or 
even of potential value. 
The function of geography teaching. As a useful analysis 
for teaching purposes, four not distinctly marked aims are 
proposed. In varying degrees these may prescribe or define 
our purposes in teaching every unit of geographical subject 
matter. 
1. To develop important natural laws so that they will be 
applied. A few great generalizations always prove worth 
while from the standpoint of general intelligence, and to a 
few individuals may possess great practical significance. 
To cite but one example, we should reach the stage of under- 
standing ‘‘that subject about which there has been so much 
talk and so little done;’’ namely, the weather. Depending 
upon most weather signs represents a stage of comfortable 
superstition ; consulting the almanac in January to prognos- 
ticate weather in July, by millions of otherwise fairly intelligent 
persons, is a striking example of the failure of our geography 
teaching hitherto to bring into the intellectual horizon of the 
average citizen the scientific truth of “‘ all weather comes from 
the west,” or the value of a barometer. In most parts of the 
United States ‘‘ lows” and “ highs” move along fairly well 
established paths, and yet a surprising number of people 
regard all weather as utterly devoid of plan, a thing of caprice, 
malevolent to-day, benevolent to-morrow, but never subject 
to any kind of law. This naive and animistic conception of 
inevitable and intimately interesting natural phenomena is 
too common to appear shocking, but one who has learned 
even a few of the great lessons of geography may look with 
supreme disdain upon such geographical illiteracy of the 
multitude. The immediately practical consequences of living 
 
-P-A-G-E-319
  
The Teaching of Geography 311 
in a world which seems ordered and understood may be negligi- 
ble, but the mental attitude which leaves one less field for 
superstition and vague conjecture is a primary goal for the 
geography teacher’s aspirations. 
2. To fix important facts and relationships. Like the pre- 
ceding, this is for most pupils not an immediately practical 
purpose, but it helps to interpret the world that education is 
building for each pupil. Practically, very few people need 
to know about Venice or Melbourne; few American children 
will go to the Arctic regions; most of those who attend our 
schools will never journey to Liverpool or even to New York. 
The World War demonstrated the fact that places of which 
we had never heard might suddenly assume great significance, 
but it was seldom an immediately and necessarily practical 
import such as the railway mail clerk encounters when he 
makes daily use of his long list of place names and time 
tables. Our geography facts make thought and action more 
intelligent by furnishing a basis for appreciating our relation- 
ships with other countries and peoples and in developing 
desirable attitudes toward them. 
3. To establish permanent geographical interests. Guidance 
in the geography content so abundant in our general reading, 
as an inspiration to continue study of the earth and its people, 
means widened sympathy and a liberalized moral judgment. 
Customs and ways of living which seem foolish may appear 
to be necessary and wise when geographic conditions are 
understood. The successful ingenuity and perseverance of 
humanity in overcoming the obstacles of environment teaches 
the lesson of human worth. The stories of such achievements 
will be learned from newspapers, magazines, the public 
museum or library, and from popular lectures if only pupils 
develop appreciation of geography. 
4. To acquire practical facts and use of geography tools. 
There is sufficient probable need of geographical facts in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-320
  312 The Technique of Teaching 
lives of most pupils to justify teaching a large number of 
these. Selection of those which will be assuredly and uni- 
versally worth while is the cause of much controversy. It 
is unanimously agreed, however, that the use of such highly 
complex tools as maps is indispensable in the lives of a majority 
who live in civilization. Almost any member of a modern 
community may find it necessary to modify his actions by 
what he learns from a railroad map or time-table; increased 
use of the automobile has given “trails” and highways to 
many thousands the map importance once possessed by the 
capes in the days of sailor geography. Ability to use maps is 
of more importance to most pupils than a store of place knowl- 
edge without this ability. 
What shall we teach? Content of the geography curriculum 
readily becomes traditional in the most invidious sense of 
that greatly abused term. When a unit of subject matter is 
admittedly taught for no reason but that it has been given 
attention in the past, it may be said to have only traditional 
value. The effect of altitude upon climate has long been taught 
and is therefore traditional subject matter, but its importance 
is so easily demonstrated as to command attention in any 
case.. Much content of geography courses, common at all 
times during the past seventy years, might not be restored 
if by any chance we should forget to teach it for half a decade. 
Geography courses are still largely determined by tradition 
and the subjective judgment of leaders who make our text- 
books, though interesting attempts have been made to de- 
termine scientifically what content is actually of greatest 
consequence. Geographical references as recorded in current 
newspapers and periodical literature have been tabulated 
to make possible a group of minimum essentials. Relative 
importance of a name or place is estimated to be in proportion 
to its frequency of recurrence. Thus, if, as a rule, London 
is encountered five times as often as Labrador, it might in
-P-A-G-E-321
The Teaching of Geography 313 
general be considered five times as worthy of study. The 
large amount of passing material and local content in all 
our general reading renders such curriculum determination 
well-nigh impossible, but the experiment of listing geography 
facts encountered in reading during a month, or the geography 
facts found in a daily newspaper during a week is worth 
making. 
Though scientific curriculum making has not as yet fur- 
nished much guidance in geography, it seems axiomatic that, 
in elementary grades, only important relationships most 
useful in understanding regions and peoples of the earth can be 
given time. A study of the field also reveals several marked 
tendencies of which the alert teacher may well take note. 
Factual or rational? Undue emphasis upon fact geography 
is indicated in the presence of too exclusive what, where, 
name, locate, or trace in the teacher’s repertoire. Unimportant 
facts are often taught, or if selection of material is satis- 
factory, facts are presented in isolation, without relation to 
each other or to the world in which they are supposed to 
have meaning. Geography teachers have usually erred in 
presenting too many unrelated facts and in breaking answer 
content into very small bits. Most textbooks of a generation 
or more ago contain thousands of questions of which the 
following are representative: 
How many states are included in the northeastern section? 
What is the character of the surface? 
What are the chief agricultural products? 
Name the chief manufactured products. 
A deal of recent method literature is justified in pointing 
out the ever present danger of attempting to present too many 
facts and of neglecting the meaning of their relationships, 
and in ridiculing the stupidity of an unmotivated drill; but 
in heeding this loud cry, it is still worth while to remember 
that, without possession of a fund of important facts, rational 
 
-P-A-G-E-322
314 The Technique of Teaching 
geography lacks basic elements and becomes nebulous. The 
factual and rational must be judiciously combined. Inter- 
pretation is a process which calls for facts. In geography 
this most often means the facts of place or location. 
More place geography needed. 1. Readily applied if well 
taught. The notion that all place geography is bookish and 
cannot be applied is not universally valid. Many who grew 
up under the place geography régime of a generation ago 
have never encountered the slightest difficulty in application 
of their knowledge, even though it was acquired in fragmentary 
lessons which present standards cannot approve. In fact, 
if it were a choice between giving thorough drill upon even 
unrelated facts and so organizing subject matter as to eliminate 
all geography drill, as some teachers, unduly fearful of being 
thought formal, have done, the older plan has much to rec- 
ommend it. Sufficient geography facts cannot be taught 
informally, but fact geography teaching is not of necessity 
a stupid process. 
2. Place relations are permanent. A second argument in 
favor of stress upon place relations is the fact that the most 
important of these at least ‘‘stay put.’”” Teachers who are fool- 
ish enough to place undue emphasis upon items of trivial 
import in place geography are perhaps equally foolish in 
requiring pupils to memorize unprofitable facts of commercial 
geography. The ‘‘Albany is the capital of New York, situated 
on the left bank of the Hudson River” of our grandfathers ; 
the ‘‘Cape Charles, Cape Henry, Cape Hatteras, Cape Look- 
out, Cape Fear’’ of the next generation, and the more recent 
“Breslau is the greatest wool market in the world” or “ 
is the second state in the production of ”” are about equally 
significant in their exactness. Except for local purposes none 
of these facts is worth learning, but the place facts have 
the merit of remaining true while the industrial and com- 
mercial facts change with the rapidity of current events.   
 
-P-A-G-E-323
  The Teaching of Geography 315 
3. Incidental learning of place relations insufficient. A 
psychological argument for greater attention to place relations 
in geography is the important fact that without specific 
drill such subjects are not learned. Too exclusive attention 
to drill makes the subject stupid and meaningless ; depending 
entirely upon acquisition of place facts encountered in pursuit 
of projects, however valuable, results in impression so faint 
that it is soon lost. As a suggestion of the amount of place 
geography which should be required, the accompanying list 
is offered : 
STANDARDS OF ATTAINMENT IN PLACE GEOGRAPHY FOR 
E1cHTH GRADE PuPILs 
I. Beable to locate on outline map all of United States, and the impor- 
tant countries of Europe, Asia, South America, Africa. 
II. Location of sixteen rivers in North America,three of South America, 
four of Africa, six of Asia, two of British Isles, two of Germany, 
two of Russia, the Danube, two of France, in addition to the 
rivers of its vicinity. 
III. Location of arms of the sea important in commerce. 
IV. Location of important islands or groups of islands. 
V. Location and direction of a dozen mountain ranges and the location 
of half a dozen noted peaks. 
VI. Location of Cape of Good Hope, Cape Horn, and a few others which 
are prominent. 
VII. Location of important colonies of chief nations. 
VIII. Location and general significance of twenty-five cities in the United 
States and an equal number in foreign countries. 
IX. Be familiar with names of fifty other cities and know at least the 
country in which each is located. 
Local or remote content? In the earliest school years, 
geography material belongs either to the local and personal 
which the pupil can see or touch, or to the beyond of which 
he can only be told and must know indirectly. The first is
-P-A-G-E-324
  316 The Technique of Teaching 
foundation for the second. The proper pedagogical approach 
to larger relations in geography is through the local community. 
Island is understood after islands have been discovered in the 
nearby creek. Maps of the school yard prepare for compre- 
hension of county, state, or world maps. Visits to local in- 
dustrial plants give meaning to what is read about occupa- 
tions, industries, and products. The necessity of a local 
approach is universally admitted. 
In carrying out home studies and projects, however, it 
should be noted that one test of the educational value of 
material deemed worthy of a place in the curriculum is the 
probability of its being equally well acquired if left to the 
pupil’s non-school environment. If material would be learned 
as well if there were not schools, why waste precious school 
time upon it? A serious waste in some schools is repeated 
presentation of home geography facts which have only moder- 
ate importance in any case, and which, because of their neces- 
sary connection with the pupil’s later life, will come in for 
a large share of incidental over learning. The location of 
villages and streams of the immediate vicinity is not of suffi- 
cient importance to justify its repeated presentation, even if 
given an industrial setting. Most pupils are in need of know- 
ing about the world which is not a part of their immediate 
environment, and interest in the remote is a no less compelling 
motive than interest in the near at hand. Children are often 
more keenly concerned about the Eskimos or tea raising than 
about their own village as a wheat-market, and in achieving 
any of the functions geography is designed to fulfill, these 
wider interests may well receive greater recognition. 
Use of types and comparisons. In nearly every phase of 
geography teaching, relative are more important than abso- 
lute facts. Few persons can remember that Pennsylvania 
has 45,126 square miles and New Jersey 8224, or even that 
Pennsylvania is five and one-half times as large as New Jersey,
-P-A-G-E-325
  
The Teaching of Geography 317 
but they can all be sure that it is very much larger. Likewise 
few may recall even the number of hundreds of thousands of 
people in our largest cities but all may fix, as permanent 
associations, a group of cities very large when compared 
with all others. It is not too much to expect that pupils will 
learn the comparative size of oceans and continents and be 
able roughly to visualize comparative map distances. Com- 
parisons soon lead to important generalizations without 
which geography remains a blind series of unrelated facts. 
After pupils have studied the isolating effects of island en- 
vironment in England or Japan, they recognize a type and 
are ready to interpret Iceland, Cuba, or Madagascar. If 
they know the characteristics of mountain people in the Alps 
or Pyrenees, they readily appreciate the traits of Scottish 
Highlanders or conditions among the mountaineers of our 
southern Appalachians. Only by development of principles— 
facts used to save time—and of types, useful because of their 
general application, can the almost unlimited number of 
possible geography facts be brought into intelligible relations. 
Problems in geography teaching. In upper grades especially, 
problems in geography are not those which can be solved by 
direct investigation. Second hand, that is, book material, 
is the chief dependence; but book problems are not less real, 
provided concrete experience is in the background. In the 
typical primary grade problems of the following list, it may 
be noted that there is opportunity for direct investigation 
as well as use of books. Similar problems may be grouped 
around rain, wind, clouds, and about local occupations, such 
as haying, furniture making, or fishing. 
Snow Problems for Lower Grades 
Does ground freeze deeper when bare or when snow covered? 
Why? 
Of what use is snow to fall-sown grain; to seeds, to shrubs, and 
to trees? 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
  
  318 The Technique of Teaching 
Why are houses sometimes banked with earth? Would snow 
serve the purpose as well? 
Make a summary of the good effects of snow. What harm is 
done by it? 
Other typical problems may be suggestive of those which 
can be devised in large number for any grade. 
Compare how we are fed or clothed with the way the Cave 
Dwellers were fed or clothed. 
Why does Holland have so many wind mills? 
Why has Great Britain been the greatest exporter of coal in the 
world? 
What has made Argentina the strongest country in South 
America? 
Find out whether the United States produces enough sugar for 
its own needs. 
Find out whether the New England states could have become 
a great nation. 
List all the various things used in your community but not pro- 
duced in the community. For convenience classify them as food, 
clothing, building material and house furnishings, tools, machines, 
and implements; others. 
The problem approach takes hold in motive where a more 
static assignment will not. “The next lesson will be about 
agriculture in Russia,” lacks the grip of “Why is agriculture 
the most important occupation in Russia?” or “In what ways 
is agriculture in Russia like agriculture in the United States 
and in what ways different?” the last involving a problem of 
comparison. Judicious formulation of problems and selection 
of those adapted to pupils’ ability stimulate untold interest 
in juvenile research and result in ability to use gazetteers, 
atlases, reference books, government reports, magazines, 
and newspapers. This is one of the aims of geography teach- 
ing; and everyone who has ever done research work knows 
that every study, seriously undertaken and carried through, 
results in a permanent life interest. 
Projects. Projects, using the term to include a more sus-

tained effort than the ordinary problem, and often involving 
motor or constructive activity, may be developed in all grades. 
Projects, like the following, are suitable for primary grades: 319 
Study of Eskimos who live in cold barren land. Represent an 
Eskimo house on the sand table. Cut out animals; as, seal, bear, 
reindeer, dog, musk ox. 
Construct a lumber camp. Make log cabin of twigs. Use dolls 
for men, cotton for snow. 
Make an Indian wigwam; the interior of a Japanese house. 
Make a Holland scene, showing canals and wind mills. 
Make a desert scene, with oasis, pyramids, tents, and caravan. 
Dramatize an oriental bazaar after constructing booths. £ 
Keeping weather chart. This is an old and most valuable 
project which may be adapted to the needs of pupils in all grades. 
A simple form is suggested.

320 The Technique of Teaching 
After a short experience and discussion pupils may be encour- 
aged to make weather forecasts from day to day, keeping record 
of their per cent of correctness. 
Relation of Geography with History. If the content of 
geography be analyzed it may be roughly classified as mathe- 
matical and physical, commercial and political. The last 
cannot be separated from knowledge of the history which 
accounts for boundary lines, capital cities, and forms of govern- 
ment. Commercial geography likewise makes history intel- 
ligible by showing the relation of trade routes to population 
and industry. Modern history has no clear meaning without 
an understanding of the significance of coal, iron, and forests 
in relation to markets. Current events teaching demands 
use of geographical knowledge. The rapid changes in occupa- 
tion which history brings, even in short periods, renders 
useless many facts of geography. Newspaper headlines may 
feature Abyssinia to-day, an obscure Balkan State to-morrow, 
and a hitherto undiscovered Russian port next. No teaching 
of geography can. anticipate the rapid march of current events, 
but they can have meaning only through a liberal general 
foundation in geography. 
Maps. 1. The importance of maps. For at least two 
thousand years geography has been taught with maps. 
Though a comparatively new subject under its present name, 
ars geometrica and ars arithmetica of the seven liberal arts 
carried much geographical content and used elaborate if 
not very accurate maps. A constant note of Stowe and 
Horace Mann, in the educational awakening which resulted 
in our public school system, was praise of European teachers 
who made vital use of maps, skillfully causing pupils to picture 
the features which maps are devised to show. Our supply 
of maps is now more liberal than anything Horace Mann 
could have dreamed of, but we are constantly in need of 
educational crusaders to urge upon teachers the necessity
-P-A-G-E-329
  The Teaching of Geography 321 
of using their map equipment. A county superintendent, 
visiting a school four months after the opening of the term, 
found a teacher who had never used the high priced set of 
maps provided by the energetic efforts of a former more 
alert teacher, and who in fact did not know how to unroll 
a map from the case. Sitting teachers sometimes apparently 
fear to disturb themselves or the orderly progress of a class 
exercise by the effort necessary to place a wall map before 
their pupils, and a much larger number fail to secure maximum 
use of the small maps in their textbooks. The greatest cause 
of failure to use maps is doubtless ignorance on the part of 
many as to their essential purpose. 
2. Purposes of maps. Analysis of the purposes which maps 
may be expected to serve reveal two. First, they show directly 
and accurately but upon a reduced scale, location, outlines, 
direction, and distance, relative and absolute. Second, they 
stand for all manner of facts not in any way directly indicated 
in the map itself but suggestive of inferences made because 
of previous geographical experience. The ordinary map 
shows nothing of climatic conditions, but one who is acquainted 
with the general laws of latitude and altitude is likely to 
think that Greenland looks cold and to see the Alps as snow- 
capped. Though a map may represent directly none of the 
facts of industry or production, these and a multitude of 
other facts are read into his map as soon as the pupil has 
accumulated even a moderate fund of geographical capital. 
Of the two functions, the first is primary and essential; as 
a tool, it is this function which a map is called upon to serve. 
It is the outline-location-direction-distance map which every 
one needs to image and carry in mind, subject to recall at 
suggestion. 
3. Kinds of maps. a. Outline maps. These include the 
ordinary wall map, those commonly found in textbooks, and 
maps sketched on the blackboard. They contribute to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-330
  322 The Technique of Teaching 
primary purpose of map study; i. e., acquiring the location of 
cities, mountains, rivers, lakes, coast lines and boundaries, 
and a knowledge of distances and directions, in order to be 
reasonably intelligent as measured by this standard. Acquiring 
the standard quota of location material may in itself be adopted 
as a project to be achieved during a given period—a half 
year perhaps. 
b. Rainfall, temperature, drainage, surface, and population 
maps. Each of these isolates an important set of geographic 
features, political boundaries being preserved but not made 
prominent. Regions of excess or defect are emphasized, 
coloring or shading being used to indicate degree. Such maps 
are abundantly provided in textbooks and frequently occur 
in current reading material. Their meaning is so clear to many 
teachers that it is assumed that pupils will comprehend and 
use them. This some of them will not do unless each kind 
of map is specifically explained. 
c. Illustrated product and industry maps. In general, 
specialized maps are best when they attempt to present but 
one notion. They may be qualitative or quantitative but 
not both. Thus a map cannot show by vari-colored shadings 
the amount of wheat raised and, by illustrative drawings or 
piles of wheat grains, indicate the location of wheat areas. 
If pupils find entertainment in the device of decorating a 
wheat state with wheat, a zinc producing region with zinc, 
or a coal section with pieces of coal, this activity should be 
recognized as only a means of fixing the general location 
from which these products in large quantities come. If such 
exercises are to have any specific educative value at all, it 
must be recognized that the primary function of product 
map exhibits is to fix location; instead, many pupils fancy 
that they are dressing up the map to look like the region it 
Tepresents. 
d. Relief maps. These have a doubtful value in graded  
-P-A-G-E-331
  The Teaching of Geography 323 
or rural school classes. Maps cannot be made to show how 
a region actually appears, and the attempt to indicate how 
relative elevations might look to some one regarding a con- 
tinent as he might an object held in the hand, are misleading. 
The relief map itself may show relative altitudes correctly, 
but most of what its use is usually supposed to reinforce is 
better done on the sand table and even this is of uncertain 
value above the fourth grade. 
e. Weather maps. Theseare distinctly worthy of attention 
from all pupils of upper intermediate and grammar grades. 
Their one purpose is not that of location, outline, or any other 
of those for which maps are primarily used. They make possi- 
ble an understanding of the weather, and are not themselves 
comprehended until such terms as isotherm, isobar, “‘high,”’ 
and “low” are explained. If studied daily in connection with 
weather chart projects, pupils not only find them intensely 
interesting but quickly develop ability to understand govern- 
ment weather forecasts, which have practical value for a few 
and general intelligence significance for many more. 
4. Teaching use of maps. When teachers have better com- 
prehension of what school maps are for and a more definite 
technique in their use, less of our geography will be formal 
and unapplied. Horace Mann’s story of the pupil who had 
studied about the earth but admitted that he had never seen 
it; the pupil who grew up fondly believing Kansas was red 
because it was of that shade in his book; the child living in 
a Mississippi river town who never had a suspicion that the 
book river at school was the one into which he threw pebbles 
on the way home; or the little girl who worried away happy 
days trying to understand how the Nile overcame the force 
of gravity in flowing up as it did in all her books, are doubtless 
exaggerated cases, but teachers who do nothing to prevent the 
misunderstanding likely to result from use of a Mercator’s 
projection map with its distorted areas, or maps drawn to
-P-A-G-E-332
      324 The Technique of Teaching 
different scales, are not alert in map technique. Preventing 
misunderstandings is but a small part of the teaching problem. 
To gain significant impressions at all, most pupils need 
teachers who are constantly profiting by such suggestions 
as those which follow and by others encountered in their pro- 
fessional reading. 
a. Explanation of symbols. The use of any map involves 
understanding of many symbols with which teachers are 
so familiar as to forget that they once had to learn them. 
Boundary lines, symbols for towns, cities, and capitals; how 
mountains, lakes, and rivers are designated; the use of parallels 
and meridians—the meaning of all these is far from evident 
until each has been amply and specifically explained. 
b. Specialized map study. In map study it is most pro- 
ductive of results to specialize upon one or a few topics or 
features. This procedure, the widely used blackboard outline 
map makes possible. Even better, for those who have a 
moderate degree of blackboard sketching skill, is the map 
drawn by the teacher as the class exercise proceeds. 
c. Map drawing. Map reading is far more important than 
map drawing, but many pupils never understand a map until 
they have made one or more. A coast line which has in turn 
been studied, modeled in clay or sand, and then drawn on 
a map is understood. In map drawing, it is probably best 
to furnish pupils with a perfect outline or stencil for their 
first efforts; next they may trace and finally make their own 
outlines by free hand. It is very doubtful, however, whether 
pupils should ever be required to draw the outline of anything 
so irregular and intricate as the continent of Europe. Too 
much time should not be devoted to the drawing of any map, 
and it is evident that map drawing is seldom an end in itself. 
It is a device for improving map reading and for compre- 
hension of the relations a map is designed to show. 
d. Motive in map study. Probably the fundamental cause
-P-A-G-E-333
  The Teaching of Geography 325 
of unsatisfactory results in map study is to be found in the 
fact that for most pupils it presents no problem. A geography 
textbook widely used fifty years ago contains thousands of 
map questions, of which the following are a typical group: 
On which side of the LaPlata is Buenos Ayres? 
On which side is Montevideo? 
In what country is Rio Janeiro? 
In which country of South America is Valparaiso? 
In which country of South America is Quito? 
Is Atacama Desert in Peru? Where is it? 
Are the Andes Mountains in Brazil? 
Of what river is the Rio Negro a branch? 
Begin with Patagonia and say the countries of South America 
over in order as you find them, going toward the north. After- 
wards commence with New Grenada and say them over in the 
order you find them going from north to south. 
These resemble unrelated elementary combinations in 
arithmetic; they are drill exercises only, the problem being 
in each case to secure the proper little answer. Every suc- 
cessful organization of map study into larger units in which 
the pupil vicariously adopts a real problem, reduces unprofita- 
ble fragmentary questioning. Ideally the pupil may have 
much of the sailor’s interest in a map; it is a guide in solving 
problems. 
The use of globes. A writer in the sixteenth century 
urges the use of globes in teaching. Locke mentions a pupil 
who, at the age of six, was unusually intelligent because his 
mother had used a globe in his geography instruction, but 
J. Orville Taylor, writing in 1834,! says that not one American 
school in a thousand has a globe and gives the story, frequently 
quoted since, of a pupil who, for the first time, saw the sphericity 
of the earth demonstrated by means of a globe. “You don’t 
mean the earth is round like that?” “Yes; didn’t you learn that 
before?” “Yes, I learned it but I never knew it before.” Globes,

  326 The Technique of Teaching 
though long recognized as essential, have but recently come 
into their own as generally used teaching accessories. 
Their profitable use is limited to illustration and vivifying 
of the facts and principles of mathematical and physical 
geography which maps are ineffective in demonstrating, and 
it is not unusual for teachers to spend too much time in ex- 
plaining these principles to pupils, few of whom will under- 
stand even with the globe. The essential teaching purpose of 
a globe can be accomplished in a 
few lessons, and inexpensive globes 
serve the purpose quite as well as 
high priced or complex apparatus. 
Diagrams and graphs. Noclear 
line may be drawn between maps 
and diagrams. The most effective 
diagram is usually made by teacher 
or pupil to explain but one point, 
and is dependent upon very few 
lines or details. For example, 
many ocean current or trade wind maps, which are essential 
diagrams, confuse pupils by their complexity or the pres- 
ence of too many details. The accompanying very simple 
diagram has greater teaching value for most pupils than 
the most elaborately constructed map; in general, diagrams 
in geography are best when least complex. 
Statistics are more important in geography than in any 
other common school subject. Naturally few of them are to 
be remembered except relatively, and comparative relation- 
ships are best made evident to most minds by simple graphs. 
A line one half inch long to represent the length of the Hudson 
and another fourteen times as long to indicate the length of 
the Missouri-Mississippi, are the type of graphical represen- 
tation with which pupils become familiar. It is the school’s 
business and largely that of the teacher of geography to    Sal Westerlies 
  
-P-A-G-E-335
  The Teaching of Geography 327 
develop ability to read, with understanding, graphical studies 
common in the fields of population, production, and com- 
merce. Graph comprehension is most safely assured by 
graph making in school. 
Pictures. In geography teaching pictures are needed in 
great profusion and variety, for the sake of vividness and 
preventing misunderstanding. It is probable that the abundant 
picture environment of the present has resulted in failure 
of unguided or casual use of illustration to make lasting im- 
pression, but few teachers are exposed to the danger of using 
too much of this kind of material. Geography teachers who 
have achieved standard general training, beyond all others, 
are more in need of travel than of summer schools, and in all 
their journeys they should be collecting. Whenever an in- 
dividual or museum collection of pictures becomes large, 
indexing for convenient use becomes a problem. Whether 
the basis shall be that of subjects or regions seems to be best 
determined by individual needs. The indexing problem, 
however, has to be solved, and it is only less important than 
securing the pictures themselves. Remarking to a class, 
“T have some pictures of that, but I could not find them,” 
has little teaching power. The personal collection of post- 
card views and photographs has a significance not possible 
to ordinary views of things not seen. The realness of a picture 
is greatly enhanced if the tcacher can say with authority, 
“This is a true and accurate view,” and can add important 
details not evident in a casual survey of the picture itself. 
Aside from pictures collected in traveling, magazines, 
newspapers, pleasure resort prospectuses, commercial club 
and railroad advertising matter, and guide books are rich in 
illustrative material. Stereographs, which present the real 
in perspective and have the descriptive material printed on 
the reverse side of the card, when prepared for school use, 
are both inexpensive and serviceable. The stereopticon and
-P-A-G-E-336
  328 The Technique of Teaching 
teflectroscope make available in large size many pictures 
too small to be of value otherwise, and possess the advantage 
of centering attention upon the subject under discussion. 
Lantern slide maps afford size and clearness of outline. Moving 
pictures are successfully enriching the teaching of geography 
in many schools and, though there is no probability that 
visual instruction will replace use of textbooks, it may much 
more generally than now becomea useful supplementary agency. 
In all picture study there is a large element of incidental 
and unmeasured learning. The net result of a study of pic- 
tures, even though it is more extensive than the casual atten- 
tion so often accorded, usually presents no great array of 
tangible facts, but of its kind, picture education has as great 
value as the so-called solid work of textbooks. Both are 
indispensable, and pictures may be studied as well as merely 
looked at. 
The educational museum. This agency achieves its 
greatest educational utility in the field of geography. Cabinets 
of minerals, rocks, fossils, flowers, cross sections of woods, 
samples of grains, commercial products at various stages 
in their manufacture, are worth while. Such material may, 
as in the case of pictures, be presented so abundantly that 
pupils become surfeited; but few schools are so well supplied 
as to lead to this danger. The personal interest motive is so 
strong that collections made by pupils and teachers for their 
own use are effective, even more than larger exhibits which 
have come without effort. No school is so little that it cannot 
accumulate a small collection of geographical museum material. 
Field trips and excursions. “Don’t read about land forms; 
go and see them,” is advice which may well be made to include 
other fields of geographic interest. Visits to mills, factories, 
quarries, mines, and other industrial or business establish- 
ments have advantages over the museum and the imaginary 
journey. Such visits must be thoroughly planned, the teacher
-P-A-G-E-337
  The Teaching of Geography 329 
going over the ground first, arranging at least an outline of 
minimum essentials of what is to be seen or experienced. 
Without prearrangement, many field trips are neither better 
nor worse educationally than half an hour on the playground. 
Notebooks find a legitimate use in most excursions for study. 
An occasional expedient consists of sending a committee on 
an excursion, asking them to report to those of the class who 
did not go. 
Use of textbooks. Expert geography teachers are notably 
successful in connecting their work with real content through 
first hand contacts, periodical literature, and supplementary 
reading with which all better equipped schools are now liber- 
ally supplied. Textbooks, however, occupy and will continue 
to hold a large place in geography, and the most reliable 
single measure of teaching ability may be found in use of 
textbooks. Characteristic difficulties and errors in the work 
of geography teachers are familiar to all who have visited 
many classrooms. 
1. Pupils cannot read. This obstacle is common to all 
content subjects. Specific word drills are as necessary as in 
reading classes and cannot be omitted if anything is to be 
accomplished. 
2. Preparation is important. Inadequate preparation of 
most teachers results in poorly organized lesson plans or no 
plan at all. Without systematic preparation there is little 
motive for study; weak teachers, finding that their pupils 
have gained nothing from the study period, hit upon the time 
consuming expedient of “reading the lesson over.” To a 
greater extent than in any other school subject, the geography 
textbook is made the medium of a badly conducted reading 
lesson. The teacher who once clearly forms the ideal of an 
assignment as a series of problems will never be guilty of this 
very common fault. 
3. Problem questions and varied drill. The old-fashioned
-P-A-G-E-338
  330 The Technique of Teaching 
map questions, profuse in number, unrelated, and often of 
trivial content have disappeared, but immature teachers, left 
to their own devices, often ask worse questions, or neglect map 
study entirely. It has been suggested that problem questions 
can be devised which will cause the pupil to identify himself 
vicariously with those who travel or execute projects of in- 
dustry and commerce. In addition, effort intelligently ex- 
pended in planning variety in drill lessons will bring results 
nowhere more quickly than in geography, and in no subject is 
effective drill more needed. 
EXERCISES 
1. Cite evidence from your own observations to prove the truth or falsity 
of each of these statements: 
a. Geography is badly taught because pupils cannot read. 
b. Geography is badly taught because teachers have not read. 
c. The best arrangement of geography material is the regional, in which 
everything is arranged in relation to a country in one place. 
d, The only permissible arrangement of geography material is the 
systematic rather than the regional. Surface, drainage, coast line, and the 
various industries should be presented as separate topics. 
e. “Pupils should be led to make outlines of each country studied. In 
the end they will have a notion of a general outline which should be pre- 
pared, or which could be prepared for each country.” (The foregoing is 
taken from a recent publication.) In a textbook widely used fifty years ago 
the following outline in bold-face type occurs two hundred times: 
Geographical Position 
Surface of the Country 
Soil, Climate, and Productions 
Inhabitants—Industrial Pursuits 
Important Cities 
f. An ordinary geography textbook contains about 1500 names, and, in- 
‘cluding maps, many more. The average intelligent man or woman is seldom 
familiar with more than 300 or 400 of these. The average pupil leaving the 
eighth grade knows more but quickly forgets down to about 100 or 200 and 
then learns again by use. 
2. Evaluate the probable worth of the following devices used by geog- 
raphy teachers:
-P-A-G-E-339
  The Teaching of Geography 331 
a. Geography Game: ‘I Packed My Grip for London.” 
Pupil A. “I came from Gallatin county and I brought an apple.” 
Pupil B. ‘I came from Gallatin county and I brought an apple and a 
bale of hay.” 
Each successive pupil adds the name of a product until a complete list 
is made. 
b. Teacher or pupils in turn make statements like, ‘The city I am 
thinking of is the chief copper mining center in Montana,” or ‘The country 
I am thinking of is just north of the United States.’ The pupil who first 
shouts ‘“‘Butte”’ or ‘‘Canada’’ may count for himself the one he has named. 
If the game is made to go with snap and vigor all may stand at the black- 
board, each writing the names he wins. 
c. Direction exercise. A teacher asked pupils to stand facing New York, 
South America, Japan, the North Pole. 
d. Initial exercise. Teacher or pupil may act as leader, making state- 
ments such as, ‘I am thinking of a city in France; it begins with M.” 
“T am thinking of a city in England; it begins with B.” Use complete sen- 
tences in giving answers. ‘Is it Birmingham?” ‘‘Yes, it is Birmingham.” 
e. Drawing map to a scale. Use wide ruled graph paper. Choose the 
school building or an agreed central point and draw base lines in color. Let 
each square represent a block, quarter mile, mile, ten miles, or a hundred 
miles. Accurate placing of buildings, towns, rivers, or boundaries is thus 
rendered possible. 
f. A coéperative map. Half a dozen pupils join in placing a map on the 
blackboard or upon the playground, using clover blossoms, dandelion 
blossoms, or stones in making the outline. 
g. Eyes closed: map questions. 
Close your eyes and tell which ocean is east of Africa. 
What continent is east of South America? 
Which is the largest state bordering on the Pacific? 
h. A silent reading map exercise for a study period. 
Trace a map of the United States. 
Put a cross where the largest city is located. 
Color blue the longest river in the world. 
Draw a tree in the state where the largest tree grows. 
Draw a mill where the most flour is made. 
t. A pupil describes a river and a classmate gives its name. 
j. Place numbers upon a blackboard outline map, instead of names of 
places. Pupils at their seats write numbers and names of places numbers 
indicate. Papers may be corrected easily and quickly.
-P-A-G-E-340
  332 The Technique of Teaching 
k. Location contest: After sides have been chosen, a pupil from side A 
takes his place before a wall map of the region to be reviewed, facing the 
class. A member of the opposing team names a place or feature to be 
located. The one at the map must find this before the teacher counts ten or 
within a given number of seconds. Every correct performance within the 
time limit scores one for the side of the pupil at the map, who retains his 
place as long as he is successful. When he fails, a member of the other team 
takes his place. To avoid confusion, require the one at the map to pro- 
nounce what he is asked to find before turning to the map. 
1, Review exercise. Names of places, rivers, seas, and countries to be 
reviewed are written upon slips of paper which are placed face downward. 
Pupils in turn draw these slips. Each one who can describe the geographical 
unit indicated on his slip so clearly that other members of the class can 
identify it, may keep his slip; other slips are returned. 
m. Twenty-four pupils arrange themselves in a circle representing the 
earth’s circumference. One may be called the prime meridian and the 
others are at 15 degrees from each other, one being the international date 
line. Another pupil goes around the circle; he may be asked to tell the time 
when it is noon at Greenwich or at any other longitude. One may “go 
around the world” tuward the east and the other toward the west, keeping 
track of the time. Both should have the same day and hour upon return to 
Greenwich but this will not be the case unless one has gained and the other 
lost a day at the international date line. 
n. Pupils write letters to children of the same age in other states or even 
in other countries. 
3. What do you find worthy of imitation or of disapproval in the follow- 
ing procedures? 
a, Finding that many state and local publications were exaggerated and 
unreliable, a teacher suggested the finding of errors in these as a project for 
an eighth grade class. 
6, A teacher was having pupils name the continents in order of their 
size. To assist slightly, she asked them to look at the map, a Mercator’s 
projection showing South America smaller than Greenland. 
c. An instructor was fond of asking pupils to point toward a number of 
distant lands or places. He usually declared all answers wrong, saying, 
“You point on the surface level; You must remember that to indicate any 
distant place you must point straight toward it and that would be down 
through the ground.” 
4. Teachers under supervision sometimes talk back to their supervisors, 
but more often, though wishing to defend their own teaching, say nothing,
-P-A-G-E-341
‘The Teaching of Geography 333 
In each of the supervisor-teacher situations which follow, defend the con- 
tention which you consider educationally correct. 
a. A supervisor said: “Your lesson on Eskimos was most interesting 
story work but it was not geography. No reasons were given why sledges 
were drawn by dogs instead of horses, for using skins instead of boards for 
canoes, nor for using oil instead of wood for fuel. Unless you bring in the 
basal element, the earth, you are not teaching geography.” 
The teacher replied, “It makes no difference whether pupils expressly 
mention geographic connections; they knew what they were talking about 
and the reasons.” 
6. Asupervisor said: “Your pupils have wrong notions of north and south; 
you allow them to say up and down in designating cardinal directions. One 
pupil said. ‘The St. Lawrence flows down into Lake Ontario and the 
Mackenzie flows up into the Arctic Sea.” 
The teacher replied, “I think these pupils know what they are talking 
about; they say ‘down town’ although it is upa hill, and they say ‘up north’ 
although that direction happens here to be down hill.” 
Was this criticism a bookish notion of the supervisor or was the teacher 
probably wrong? How would you prove either position? 
5. In the middle of the nineteenth century typical facts of geography 
were memorized and then sung to simple tunes. 
What is educationally unsound about this plan of teaching? 
6. Tests of pupils’ knowledge of geography. 
a, Given an outline map of your state, how many towns and cities out- 
side of your immediate vicinity can your pupils locate with approximate 
correctness? (An indifferent seventh grade class made an average of nine 
each; a stronger fifth grade made an average of ten.) 
b. Eighth grade geography test.! 
The following questions were used in one eighth grade test. The per 
cents indicate the average accuracy of the seven hundred and thirty-five 
pupils tested. Give the test to a geography class and compare scores. 
_ 1. Locate on the map these cities: Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, Lowell, 
New Orleans, Duluth, Galveston, Lynn. (Per cent of correctness, 68.1.) 
2. For each of these cities indicate name of a product for which the city 
is noted. (Per cent, 77.2.) 
3. Locate New York City on the map. (Per cent, 58.4.) 
4. a. Name two important crops raised in southern United States. 
(Per cent, 53.6.)

Research, 11, 701-712.
-P-A-G-E-342
  334 The Technique of Teaching 
b. Tell why these crops can be grown there. (Per cent, 53.6.) 
5. Why is there so little rainfall in the states just east of the Rocky 
Mountains? (Per cent, 60.6.) 
6. Below is given a list of articles which we use in our homes. Write 
below each word the name of the state in which that article is produced in 
large quantities. Cotton, oranges, cane sugar, rice, coal, iron. (Per cent, 
65.6.) 
7. Give reasons for the growth of Minneapolis. (Per cent, 24.4.) 
8. Why are the seaports of Russia not so important as the seaports of 
England? (Per cent, 19.2.) 
9. Of what value to the countries of Europe are their colonies in other 
parts of the world? (Per cent, 24.3.) 
to. Give reasons why the commerce of San Francisco is not so impor- 
tant as that of New York City. (Per cent, 24.4.) 
c. In a location test in geography, the task’ being to write correctly, 
upon an outline map of the United States, the names of the states, the 
number of errors was as shown in the diagram on page 335. Forty- 
eight errors would have indicated zero ability. Make the test with a 
class of upper grade pupils.

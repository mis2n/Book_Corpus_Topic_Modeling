FOREWORD 
PEUNHIS book is primarily intended as a text for all 
students of manual training high schools, trade, 
vocational, and normal schools; as a help to the manual 
training instructor and as a guide to the draftsman 
and architect; also as a means of assistance for all 
amateurs to whom this work appeals. 
Inasmuch as this book takes up the making of all 
common practical joints, no endeavor has been made to 
give a list of all joints known to man, as some of these 
are impractical, some can be replaced to advantage 
by joints the author has given, and some come under 
the heading of the steel square, the complete treatment 
of which has been given by many good authors. How- 
ever, the student will find in this book a good joint 
for every type of construction. 
Acknowledgment is hereby given my wife for her 
untiring, cheerful assistance in compiling the text of 
the book. I gratefully acknowledge also, the willing 
attitude of my students in helping to work out the 
various models used, and of my co-worker, John Henry 
McNamara, in posing for the photographic illustra- 
tions. 
To Charles F. Moore, head of my department, I 
extend thanks for the encouragement given me to take 
up and go on with this work. And to Central Commer- 
cial and Manual Training High School, I wish to 
express my appreciation for the opportunities afforded 
me in developing my manual training.

PLANING; SAWING; MARKING—P ate I 
The purpose of this exercise is to give the student 
practice in the correct use of the plane and saw, to 
teach him how to test his material (commonly known 
in the shops as ‘‘stock’’), and also to provide a drill 
in marking.

Too much emphasis cannot be placed on the impor- 
tance of this problem, since all joinery, carpentry, and 
cabinet work, to a great extent, depend upon the ability 
of the student to apply the principles brought out here. 
Each piece of wood used in the making of furniture, 
oors, sash, ete., whether made by hand or machinery, 
is put thru six steps. 
Step 1.—Plane one surface true, Fig. 1. A surface 
s true when no uneven light can be seen beneath a 
traight-edge placed on the wood, (1) with the grain,

from A to B, Plate I, and from C to D (2) across the 
erain from A to C, from B to D and (3) diagonally 
from A to D and from B to C. See also Fig. 2. 
  Fic. 2—Testing a surface 
When this surface stands all these tests, mark it 
thus, X, as an identification mark. Be sure not to omi 
doing this. In joinery thi 
surface is known as a workin 
face. 
Step 2.—At right angles t 
the working face, plane a work 
ing edge; test it as shown i 
Fig. 3. Also test it along it 
length. When this edge ha 
been made true, mark it thus 
TESTING WITH x. Do not forget to do this

surfaces marked. All future work, such as squaring 
and gaging, is done from these two surfaces—no: 
others.

  10 JOINTS AND HOW THEY ARE MADE 
Many workers prefer to use a different system of 
face marking—making one short, straight line on the 
working face with the line running out to the edge 
    
   Fic. 4—The marking gage is tilted and pushed away from the bod 
in making gage lines 
that has been selected for the working edge; and usin 
two similar lines on the working edge, the strokes bein 
made toward the working face. This system has the

size, and it also shows the direction in which the work- 
ing face may be found. 
    
Fic. 4-b—Gaging with pencil and rule—the left

Step 3—From the working edge, gage the width on 
both faces, Fig. No. 4; plane to these lines. 
Step 4.—Holding 
the head of the 
marking gage 
against the work- 
ing face, gage the 
thickness on both 
edges; plane to 
these lines. 
Step 5—With a 
knife and try- 
square, Fig. 5, held 
against the working 
face and edge, cut a   Fig. o—Try-square and knife for

Fig. 6. 
    of the line, Fig. 
7. On account of 
this end being 
cut at 45°, it will 
not be necessary 
to plane in both 
directions as 
with the other 
end. 
Drill in Mark- 
ing: — For all 
lines across the 
erain use a knife 
and try-square. 
For all lines with

marking gage.

head, or stock, of the try-square against the working 
face or edge. Put the point of the knife where the 
line is to be made, slide the blade of the square against 
the knife and cut the line. 
A study of Fig. 1 will show the student the correct 
way to use a plane. To get a surface true, the plane 
must be as long as practical to use for the length of 
wood to be planed, and the plane must be parallel with 
the sides of the wood; otherwise, held at an angle, the 
\lane will follow the irregular contour of the wood. 
In other words, you will have shortened the length of 
the plane in its cutting capacity. Frequently, however, 
the grain of the wood makes it necessary to plane at 
an angle in order to get the surface smooth. 
The distance the chip breaker is set back from the 
sutting edge of the plane-iron is governed by the wood 
to be planed and the nature of the work to be done. 
Hor soft wood and a coarse cut, the space should be 
bout 7”, and reduced more and more for hard woods 
nd fine shavings. The plane-iron must be ground 
rue, and whet until sharp—20° is considered a good 
ngle for the bevel of the plane-iron. Have but one 
evel and that on only one side of the iron. 
Remember: For good joinery work, accuracy and 
harp tools are absolutely necessary. Where possible, 
se knife and gage only—no pencil lines. 
Figs. 4-a and 4-b show quick, but not accurate ways 
f gaging lines.
-P-A-G-E-14
  CROSS-LAP JOINT—Puats IT 
In cabinet work, wherever two pieces of wood hav 
ing square edges cross each other and come flusl 
(even) on the surface, it is advisable to use the cross 
lap joint. Examples: the divisions on the top of a1 
umbrella stand, the vertical and horizontal division: 
for a nest of drawers or for the frame-work of a gate 
leg table. 
Step 1.—Plane the stock, in this case, to 134x154” 
1014”, using the method explained in preceding exer 
cise. Since we intend cutting the stock in two pieces 
it will be necessary to mark the working face and edgt

and one (B), Plate II. Cut the stock off to suitabl 
length. : 
Step 2.—Observe that the working faces must be u 
on both pieces when the joint is completed, therefor 
lay out the joint on the working face of one piece an

on the opposite face of the other. Start with a center 
line on both pieces. Lay off the distance K, or one half 
of the width of the stock, with a knife line squared 
across the surface as C-D.

Step 3—Superimpose (place) (B) on (A) in the 
form of a cross and just cover the line C-D. Witha 
knife, make a point at this distance, and draw line E-F 
with the use of the square. In like manner, mark piece 
(B) from (A). 
Step 4.—Square a short line on both edges of both

tion is more easily kept under con- 
trol   pieces, as D’-G and 
F’-H. Holding the 
marking gage against 
the working faces only 
and set for one half of 
the thicknesses (in this 
case 4%"), gage line 
G-H on both pieces. 
Step 5.—Place each 
piece in turn in the vise 
and, using the back-saw, 
saw a short distance in- 
side of lines C-D and 
E-F, not quite to the 
depth of G-H. For 
safety, it is a good idea 
to make a third saw cut 
somewhere near the 
center of the joint, so 
that in chiseling out the 
waste material, there is 
less chance of the chisel 
following the grain of 
the wood, which often is 
at an angle. 
Many persons prefer
-P-A-G-E-17
CROSS LAP JOINT 17 
the practice of cutting directly to the center of the 
knife line with the back-saw, thus eliminating the 
necessity of chiseling the joint to fit. If the worker 
has sufficient skill in the use of the saw, a very sat- 
isfactory joint may be made by this method. The 
preference for either method may be a matter of habit 
and local practice. 
Step 6.—Place each piece in turn in the vise, holding 
the flat side of a 1” chisel down, Fig. 8, and tap the 
chisel with the hand or mallet. Note that the left hand 
clings firmly to the chisel to prevent it from going too 
far. The cut must only go about half-way across and 
only remove a small portion at a time. Reverse the 
wood and work from the other side in like manner, 
until the last cut is made on the gage line. 
Step 7.—Place each piece in order on the top of the 
bench. Use a 1” or wider chisel and, with the bevel 
facing in, and placed in the knife lines C-D and E-F, 
Plate II, drive the chisel down with a few brisk blows 
of a heavy mallet, Fig. 9. Place the wood once more 
m the vise and clean out the corners. If the work has 
been done correctly, the joint will fit snugly, be flush 
on top and need only light tapping of the hand to bring 
it together. The working faces must remain, as when 
started, facing up. The surfaces should be dressed 
to insure evenness.

  PINNED THRU MORTISE-AND-TENON JOINT 
Puate III 
This form of mortise-and-tenon joint has been chosen 
as an illustration since it embodies a number of im- 
  Fic. 10—The head helps in 
steadying and giving more pres- 
_ sure to the brace, while the try- 
square is a guide for boring 
true 
18 portant principles both in 
carpentry and cabinet 
work which other types 
would not bring out. 
The mortise-and-tenon 
joint, in one of its forms, 
is by far the strongest 
and most used of all 
joints. It is made in the 
frame work in houses and 
barns (at the junction of 
the corner posts and 
girts); it is used in the 
manufacture of doors, 
sash and blinds; in the 
making of the better 
erade of furniture ;in fact, 
wherever it is practical 
and wherever strength is 
an important factor. 
Step 1.—Plane the stock 
to the size needed (in this 
case, 13¢”x114"x1014”). 
Mark the working face 
and edge on two parts of
-P-A-G-E-19

the wood, and also mark one piece (A) and the other 
(B), Plate III. Cut the piece in two. 
Step 2.—Obtain the length of the tenon in this

manner: Superimpose (A) on (B) in the form of a 
T so that the top end of (B) projects beyond the top 
edge of (A) by about 1%”. Now, with a knife put a 
point at M (referring to Plate III) on (B). Using 
the try-square and knife, cut line M-N around the 
piece, being careful to hold the head of the square 
against only the working face and edge. 
Step 3.—On one edge of piece (A) (mortise piece), 
locate a knife line, #’-C, which is located one half of 
the length M-N 
from the center line. 
Superimpose (B) 
on (A) to just cover 
this line, locating 
line #-D. 
This operation 
gives us the length 
of our mortise from 
C-F to D-E, which 
is exactly the width 
of the tenon, since 
one measurement 
was taken from the 
other. Transfer 
lines C-F and E-D 
to the opposite edge, 
but do not eut the 
lines across the face; simply make cuts on the corner. 
Step 4.—Holding the head of the marking gage 
against the working face, gage the center line G-H on 
two opposite edges. Gage line F-E (14” from the 
center lift) on opposite edges of (A) and, without   Fic. i A oeniinie the saged-bit
-P-A-G-E-21
  PINNED THRU MORTISE-AND-TENON JOINT 21 
changing the gage, gage line F’-H’ on piece (B) on 
opposite edges and across the top. Again, gage line 
C-D on (A) and C’D’ on (B). It is advisable to 
have distance F’-C a little greater than the width 
of your 14” chisel. Chisels are frequently over 
size. 
Step 5.—Using an auger-bit 7s” narrower than the 
width of the mortise (in this case a 7%” bit), bore half- 
way thru, Figs. 10 and 11, from both edges. Always 
bore end holes first, Fig. 12. 
No bit gage is necessary in 
boring holes to a certain depth, 
since an auger-bit enters 75” 
in depth for each full cutting 
turn. This may vary slightly 
with the hardness of the wood, 
but a trial will give the number 
of turns required to reach the 
desired depth. Bit gages are ° e G N

Step 6.—Place piece (A) on 
top of the bench-hook, and Fic. 12 
using a 1” chisel, shave down 
the sides of the mortise, working half-way from both 
edges. With the 14” chisel, cutting half-way from both 
edges, cut the ends. Test the inside of the mortise to 
be sure it is true. 
- §tep 7.—Place piece (B) in the vise in a vertical 
position and cut to the outside of line C’-D’ and F’-E’,

     Fig. 13—The back-saw wn 
Step 8.—Place piece (B) Mop of the bench, using 
a 1” or broader chisel, and cut the shoulders, Fig. 9. 
Now place the wood in the vise again and, cutting 
across the grain, working from both sides, shave off 
all waste wood to the gage lines C’-D’ and f’’-E’. With 
a chisel, cut a small chamfer on the end of the tenon, 
Plate III and Fig. 14. Gently drive the joint together. 
If the joint is to be pinned, follow Step 9. 
The method of using a mortise chisel and a mallet 
and chiseling the mortise without boring is preferred 
by some. In that case the mortise is made the exact 
size of the chisel and no side trimming is done. This 
is claimed to be a faster method by those who advocate 
its use. ; 
Step 9.—Locate the center of the hole for the dowel 
on the mortise piece, and zs” nearer to the shoulder 
on the tenon piece. Bore the holes on both pieces, 
  for cutting a tenon
-P-A-G-E-23
  PINNED THRU MORTISE-AND-TENON JOINT 23 
reversing the direction of boring when the spur of the 
bit shows thru. 
When the joint is put together and the pin driven 
in place, the shoulder of the tenon is forced up tight. 
The hole on the tenon piece can be located easily by 
boring the mortise piece. Putting the joint together, 
mark the center of the hole on the tenon with the bit. 
Take apart and bore the hole a little nearer the 
shoulder. 
Step 10.—Dress off the projecting part of the tenon, 
lay off the chamfer and bevel, saw off close to the line 
and block-plane to exact angle. For practice, all ends 
should be blocked up smooth and true. Note the dif- 
ference between a bevel,and a chamfer. A bevel is 
made by cutting from one surface to the opposite sur- 
face, while a chamfer is cut from one surface to the 
adjacent surface and thereby forms an additional 
surface. 
Dress the assembled joint even and true.
-P-A-G-E-24
  HAUNCHED DOUBLE MORTISE-AND-TENON 
J OINT—Puatse IV 
In cabinet work, wherever the construction calls for 
a mortise-and-tenon joint, where the rail is over 6” 
wide, the double mortise-and-tenon joint should be 
used. For frame construction without a panel, or for 
leg-and-rail construction, this is also the joint; but 
when a panel is to be built into the frame, as in the 
case of a panel door and panel work of all sorts, we 
must add to the double mortise-and-tenon joint the 
haunch, so as to fill up the groove made for the panel. 
Besides, the haunch adds strength, prevents light from 
showing thru the joint in case of shrinkage and pre- 
vents warping. 
The reason for the double mortise-and-tenon is to 
prevent weakening the construction as much as pos- 
sible by the cutting of a mortise that is too large. 
Naturally a wide rail shrinks more than a narrow 
one and, by making two places of joining, the shrink- 
age will not affect the strength so much as if one wide 
tenon were used. The wide tenon would break away 
from the glue in the mortise. Sometimes a saw cut 
is made in the tenon to prevent the breaking of the 
glued joint by shrinkage. 
Step 1.—Bring all stock to size, marking working 
face and edge. In the making of a frame or door, it 
would also be advisable at this time to mark carefully 
and clearly all members as they should appear when 
assembled. For example: On one corner put No. 1 
and No. 2; on another corner, No. 3 and No. 4, and so 
24
-P-A-G-E-25

on. This step makes it possible to construct each joint 
for a definite place.

Step 3.—Plow the grooves on all pieces. This oper- 
ation will reduce the tenon on one edge. 
Step 4.—Bore the holes and chisel out the mortises, 
Plate III. The only difference will be that the chisel- 
ing can be done from only one side. — 
Step 5.—The tenons should be cut as one wide tenon, 
of the proper thickness. Be sure to use a knife line. 
Step 6.—Saw all haunches, and chisel out between 
the tenons (see chiseling for dovetail). Cut a chamfer 
on the ends of all tenons for clearance, Plate III and 
Fig. 14,

Step 7.—Fit all panels, but not too snugly, and 14” 
narrower than the width required, so that in case tlhe 
panel should expand, it would not buckle. Before glu- © 
ing the door together, rub a little soap on the corners 
of the panels to prevent their being glued fast. Panels — 
must never be glued or nailed in place. When mold- 
ings are nailed around a panel, the nails should be 
driven into the rails and stiles, Plate IV, Sectional 
View. 
One of the values of panel construction is that 
shrinkage does not affect the outside measurements to 
any great extent; it is therefore used for all wide sur- 
faces. 
Step 8.—Dress up the assembled work even and true. 
COPED MORTISE-AND-TENON JOINT—PLATE IV 
Wherever a mortise-and-tenon joint is made, with 
members having molded edges, the shoulder part of 
the tenon must be coped. This type of joint can best 
be illustrated on the sash door having small lights 
of glass. The division strips of wood are called ‘‘mun- 
tin bars’’ or ‘‘sash bars.’’ 
Step 1.—Lay out all mortises. To obtain the exact 
location, it is best to cut the molding on a trial piece; 
this molding is cut with a sash plane, which cuts both 
molded edge and rabbet in one operation.

Muntin bars are so fitted that the continuous bars 
run in the direction in which the greatest strength is 
needed, and the shorter ones fitted in between. This 
means that in some cases the continuous bars are 
placed horizontally, in others vertically, depending up- 
on the construction.

HALF BLIND DOVETAIL JOINTS—P ate V 
The half blind dovetail joint is used as the top rail- 
and-leg construction for cabinet work; and in other 
places where a great pulling strain is to be exerted on 
the joint. The strength of this joint does not depend 
upon glue. 
Step 1—Dress the stock to size desired according 
to the drawing. Bear in mind the face marks. 
Step 2.—Lay out the joint on the rail, or piece (A). 
With a dovetail saw, saw so as to split the line. 
In sawing the shoulders, saw a little outside of 
the line and chisel to the line. Test this piece care- 
fully. Making a slight undercut on the tenon part will 
insure a better fit. 
Step 3.—Put the leg, piece (B), in the vise and lay 
out the joint on the end of (B) from piece (A) with 
a very sharp pencil; square down line B-B’ and D-D’. 
Bore one hole as large as possible, in this case 14”. 
With the dovetail saw, cut from corner A to B’ and 
from C to D’; then, using a bevel-edge chisel, cut away 
all waste material. 
The distance A-B and C-D should be a little greater 
on the leg than on the rail to allow the shoulders to 
come up tight. When glued up, it is a good idea to 
drive a brad thru the tenon into the leg, and dress off 
the joint even.

DOWEL JOINTS—Piate VII 
Generally speaking, the dowel joint is a substitute 
for the mortise-and-tenon joint, where used in the leg- 
and-rail form. It does not make so strong a joint, but 
it is more easily and more quickly made and therefore 
is a big money-saver, a fact which makes it valuable 
in the manufacture of furniture and in cabinet work. 
For curved work it is often impossible or impractical 
to use any other joint and, on account of the greater 
ease in making it, the dowel joint is within the ability 
of the amateur. 
A well-made dowel joint is by far superior to a_ 
poorly made mortise-and-tenon joint. Used in the 
form ‘‘edge-to-edge,’’ it has value wherever boards 
must be glued together to obtain the required width. 
LEG-AND-RAIL OR BUTT-DOWEL JOINT—PLATE VII 
Step 1.—Dress all stock to size, being careful to 
mark the working face and edge. 
Step 2.—With a marking gage, draw lines A-B on 
the leg and C-D on the rail. The location of C-D 
should be in the center, whereas that of A-B is gov- 
erned by the distance the rail is to be set back from 
the leg. | 
Step 3.—Place both leg and rail in the vise, Fig. 
17, and, with a try-square and knife, locate the center 
of all dowels with lines intersecting A-B and C-D. 
Step 4.—Using an auger-bit, bore all holes, Figs. 
10 and 11, to the required depth. As stated in the 
discussion of the pinned thru mortise-and-tenon joint, 
34

ful count, all holes can be bored alike. The depth of 
the hole is governed largely by the type of work, but 
the hole should never exceed about 114” in length. It 
must be remembered that the grain of the dowel pin, 
when in the joint, is usually across the grain; there- 
fore the shrinkage of the mortise member would break 
  Fic. 17—Marking leg and rail in one operation for dowel joint 
the glue away from the dowel pin. For this same 
reason it is poor practice to allow any dowel pin to ex- 
tend all the way thru one piece, as it would not shrin 
in length and in time would project beyond the surface. 
Step 5.—Place a long length of dowel rod in the vise 
in a vertical position; using a dowel pointer and brace 
slightly chamfer the end of the dowel rod. Move th 
rod up in the vise and saw off the dowel rod to th 
length required for a dowel pin. Repeat the operatio 
of chamfering and sawing off until all dowel pins hav 
been cut. It will be noted that one end of the dowe 
pins thus made will be chamfered on one end only 
When inserting these pins into their proper holes     
      
   
 
-P-A-G-E-37
DOWEL JOINTS 37 
place the square end in and keep the chamfered end 
out. The chamfer is made to make it easy for the 
dowel pins to enter their holes when forced together. 
As noted on Plate VII, this object can be accomplished 
by countersinking the holes instead of chamfering the 
pins. It is a good practice to do both so as to give 
the glue and dowel pin a better chance to enter. 
Step 6.—Drive all pins in place (square ends in) 
and try out the joint, to ascertain how it will fit. 
Step 7.—Using a pair of gas pliers, carefully pull 
up all pins just far enough so that the fingers can 
remove them when the need arises. This is done as 
a precaution in the event that one hole may not be 
deep enough to receive any of the pins. 
Step 8.—Dip the square end of the pins, half-way 
up, into the glue and drive them in place with a mallet. 
With a brush, smear glue on all parts of the pins pro- 
jecting. Brush a little glue into the holes and clamp 
the joint together and allow it to set. 
EDGE-TO-EDGE DOWEL JOINT—PLATE VII 
The edge-to-edge dowel joint is used for the most 
part in joining boards to make up a wide surface. It 
not only helps in strengthening the glued joint, but 
also helps to bring all boards flush, taking out any 
slight curves. 
Step 1—Join the edges so that when placed edge 
to edge a slight streak of light will show in the center, 
- fading away to the ends where the joint must be tight. 
This is to allow for future shrinkage of the boards. 
The ends, being exposed to the air, will naturally 
shrink sooner and to a greater extent. Mark the
-P-A-G-E-38
  38 JOINTS AND HOW THEY ARE MADE 
working faces and number the joints across the faces— 
1 and 2, 3 and 4, and so on. 
Step 2.—Place the two pieces in the vise with the 
working faces facing out. 
Step 3.—From the working faces only, gage the 
center lines H-K. With a try-square and knife inter- 
sect the center line of both pieces at the proper 
places. 
Step 4—Bore holes and make dowel pins, as for 
the butt dowel joint. 
Step.5.—When putting the joint together, place the 
boards in the original position as in Step 2. Dip the 
dowels in glue half-way up, drive the dowels in place 
and chamfer the ends exposed. Put glue on both 
edges at the same time, putting glue on the pins; turn 
the boards over, Plate VIT, and drive up tight. If the 
work has been properly executed, the working faces 
will be up and the joints flush and tight. 
END-TO-END DOWEL JOINT—PLATE VII 
The end-to-end dowel joint is made by doweling to- 
gether two pieces which have been placed end to end. 
This form of joint is used in cabinet work where it is 
necessary to carry out a strip as a continuous piece, 
as on stair-rail work, and is used extensively on curved 
work. The method of making the joint is similar to 
that used for the leg-and-rail dowel joint, except- 
ing that the work is laid out on the ends of each 
piece. 
Miter joints are sometimes doweled together, but 
since there are a number of better methods for joining 
a miter joint, the dowel method is not described here.
-P-A-G-E-39
  MITER JOINTS—Puates VIII 
Next to the mortise-and-tenon joint, with all its vari- 
ations, the miter joint is used more extensively in 
carpentry and cabinet work than any other joint. 
The miter joint is used on all molding work, for trim, 
picture frames, boxes, borders around floors, ceiling 
and cornice work, column construction, stairs, ete. 
MITER JOINT NAILED—PLATE VIII 
This type of miter joint is the most common one 
used, for the reason that it is the easiest and quickest 
to make. It is used 
very extensively on pic- 
ture frame work. 
To make the simplest 
form of miter joint, cut eee ce 
each of the two pieces at 
45°, nail and glue to- 
gether, Fig. 18. To test |-NaILiNG & Miter Jor a miter joint, hold a try- 
square on the inside Fic. 18 
edges to see if it is 90°. 
Since a miter joint shows an opening at the heel in 
shrinkage, Plate VIII, nailed miter joints, as used in 
trim work, are frequently cut slightly open on the top 
in order that, after shrinking, the joint can be driven 
up tight. 
MITER JOINT WITH SPLINE—PLATE VIII

or of putting any frame construction together than

with this joint. It is therefore used on work where 
strength and permanence are to be considered. 
Step 1.—Cut the miter. 
Step 2.—After the miter has been cut, make a groove 
on both pieces from 44” to 1144” deep, according to 
  ere 
Fic. 19—Gluing a picture frame. Note the ears for a grip while 
clamping together 
the size of the work. This cut can best be made on 
the circular-saw, or cut with a dovetail saw and 
chiseled out. 
Step 3.—Cut the spline, with the grain running as 
indicated on the drawing, Plate VIII, or at right angles 
to the joint, to fit snugly into the groove cut, and to 
extend beyond the outside and inside edges. 
Step 4.—Cut small pieces of wood, called ears, at 
45° in both directions as indicated on Plate VIII. 
These pieces are glued on by putting the glue on the 
edge and rubbing with a few firm strokes, holding the

Step 6.—Remove all handscrews and spline, being 
careful to place each one at the joint to which it is to 
be fastened. 
Step 7.—Put a good coat of glue on all ends, brush 
a coat on half of the spline and put the spline in place. 
Now brush glue on the half of the spline that projects 
and place all the pieces together. Clamp up the two 
opposite corners first, being careful that the inside 
comes to a clean corner; then clamp up the others. 
Step 8.—Test the two opposite corners for a right 
angle. Sight across the top to see if the frame is true. 
In the shop, when it has a twist, it is spoken of as 
‘thaving a wind.’’ If it has a twist, loosen on the hand- 
screws and force the frame in shape. Tighten the 
handscrews again, and allow the glue to set. 
Step 9.—Saw off the ears close to the edge of the 
frame. Dress off the back of the frame, then the front, 
until all joints are made flush. Now plane the edges. 
MITER JOINT WITH SLIP-FEATHER—PLATE VIII 
For light frames, where a quick, strong job is 
wanted, the slip-feather serves very well. 
Step 1.—Make all miter joints. 
Step 2.—Glue on ears, as already explained. Allow 
to set. 
Step 3.—Using thin glue, coat all ends and allow 
to set a few minutes until tacky. This is called ‘‘sizing 
the joint.’’ Give all joints another coat of glue and 
clamp together, Fig. 19. Allow to set. 
Step 4.—Saw off all ears. 
Step 5.—On a circular-saw, cut the grooves for the 
slip-feather. A jig will help greatly.

This joint is a substitute for either the spline or 
slip-feather miter. As shown by the section of the 
molding on Plate VIII, it would be impossible to cut 
out for a spline or slip-feather in any deep-cut molding, 
so the only thing to do is to put on the back piece. 
Step 1—Make all miters. 
Step 2.—Glue on the ears and allow to set. 
Step 3.—Size all joints and glue. Be careful to 
watch the face of the molding. Allow to set.

  DADO AND RABBET JOINTS—Puiate IX 
The end-dado joint, sometimes called dado-and- 
rabbet, is used extensively in carpentry and cabinet 
work, also for box and drawer construction. A dado 
is cut across, and a groove is cut with the grain. 
Step 1.—Dress all stock to the exact size, allowing 
for the length of the tenon part. 
  Fig. 20—Cutting a dado with a back-saw against a guide strip 
Step 2.—Make sharp knife lines for the dado on 
the face, and gage to the depth on two édges. 
Step 3.—Using a back-saw, Fig. 20, saw to the inside 
of the lines, and close to the gage lines. 
Step 4.—With the flat part of the chisel down, work 
out the waste material. Now place the chisel in a ver- 
tical position in the knife lines and cut to the exact 
mark. Chisel out the corners clean.

Step 6—Place the wood in a vertical position in 
the vise and chisel downward a small distance away 
from the line. Now clamp the wood flat on the bench 
and cut to the exact line, the chisel being held flat side 
down. 
Step 7.—Glue together, being careful not to force 
the joint, as the end grain will give way. 
RABBET JOINT—PLATE IX 
The most common use for the rabbet joint is in the 
construction of drawers—to fasten the sides to the 
front. The strength of this joint depends on nails, 
screws or dowels; sometimes on a combination of nails 
and dowels. 
Step 1—Bring all stock to the exact size required, 
being careful to make the end of the side piece a right 
angie. 
Step 2.—Cut the rabbet as you cut the end-dado. 
Step 3.—Clamp the two pieces together and nail. If 
the joint is to be doweled also, bore the holes to a — 
depth of about 114”. Dip the end of a long length of 
dowel rod in glue, drive it into the hole and saw off 
close to the sides. Repeat for the other dowels. 
DADO JOINT—PLATE IX 
The dado joint is used very often for shelf and 
drawer construction and, with a slight modification 
(when the joint does not go all the way across), it is 
called a housed joint or housed dado. In this form the 
construction of the wall string and the risers and 
treads of stairs is the best example. See Plate IX.
-P-A-G-E-47
DADO AND RABBET JOINTS 47 
Step 1.—Bring all stock to exact size, allowing 
enough in length on one | member, (A), to enter the 
dado, piece (B). 
Step 2.—On piece (A) draw a knife line A-B. Super- 
impose (B) on (A), end down, to just cover the line 
A-B. With the point of a knife, indicate the thickness 
of (B) or, in other words, the width of the dado. Now 
draw second knife line C-D. From the working face, 
gage to the depth on both edges. 
  Fic. 21—Router for cleaning out dado 
Step 3.—Saw and chisel out the dado as above, in 
end-dado. For a wide dado, clean out the waste mate- 
rial with a router plane, Fig. 21. 
Step 4—Place the joint together. If it fits too 
tightly, dress off piece (B). 
There is a special plane made, called a dado plane, 
which has two cutters, one on each side, set the width 
of the dado, which act as the knife in making lines 
A-B and C-D, also a cutting iron to take the place of 
the chisel cut when cleaning out the joint. When using 
this plane, it is advisable to clamp a strip of wood as a 
guide for the plane to slide against. This plane may
-P-A-G-E-48
  4% JOINTS AND HOW THEY ARE MADE 
be used to great advantage in making a number of 
dados of exactly the same size. For a large quantity 
of dado work, a circular-saw, equipped with a dado 
head, is to be recommended. 
DOVETAIL DADO JOINT—PLATE IX 
Like all dovetail forms of construction, the dovetail 
dado joint holds itself together without the use of any 
fasteners. This is its one great advantage over a plain 
dado joint. This joint is used a great deal for drawing 
boards, in fastening the cleats on the back. It is also 
made with a bevel cut on both sides. 
  Fig. 22—Plowing a groove 
On wide surfaces special dovetail planes are used, or 
the joint is made by machine, for it would be imprac- 
tical to make a tight joint by hand. 
HOUSED JOINT—PLATE IX 
For a housed joint or housed dado, as in the case 
of stair construction, holes are bored the entire length

of the dado, to the proper depth. With the back-saw, 
cut close to the line and work out the waste material 
with a router, Fig. 21. With a broad chisel, held ver- 
tically, cut on the line, then clean out all corners. When 
the stairs are put together, wedges are glued in place, 
forcing the joints tight on the face. 
MULTIPLE SLIP MORTISE-AND-TENON OR FINGER-

The multiple slip mortise-and-tenon or finger-lap 
joint is used almost exclusively for cheap box construc- 
tion and is made by machinery. 
TONGUE-AND-GROOVE JOINT—PLATE IX 
As stated under the end-dado joint, this joint is 
always made with the grain. It is used mostly in car- 
pentry work, in the making of good window frames, 
cornice and detail work. A good plow will be all 
that is necessary to make the tongue-and-groove joint. 
Cut the groove first and fit the tongue to it. Fig. 22.
-P-A-G-E-50
HALVED JOINTS—Puatst X 
HALVED OR END-LAP JOINT—PLATE X 
In carpentry this joint is known as a halved joint; 
in joinery it is spoken of as an end-lap joint. The 
joint is used extensively in carpentry, for the corners 
of all sills and plates, and for the fastening of corners 
.of any two members where a quickly made joint is 
wanted, as in the case of frame construction for lattice 
work. 
Step 1—Dress all stock to size; lay out the joint, 
squaring line A-B on both pieces. Locate this line by 
superimposing (A) on (B). Gage line C-D and E-F 
on both pieces from the working faces. Have working 
edges inside. 
Step 2.—Hold the wood in a horizontal position in 
the vise and with a back-saw cut to the outside of line 
A-B. Turn the wood to a vertical position in the vise 
and saw to the outside of the lines C-D and E-F. Do 
this to both pieces. 
Step 3.—Place each piece in turn on the bench; and, 
using a broad chisel, cut on line A-B. See Fig. 9. 
Step 4.—Place each piece, in turn, horizontally in 
the vise, and chisel across the grain to the gage line, 
working from both sides. Clean out the corners and 
be careful to have all cuts flat and true. This joint 
is a modification of the cross-lap, and must be gaged 
from the working faces only, to insure a flush joint.

Step 1.—Dress all stock to the exact size. Lay off 
knife line A-B on piece (A). Superimpose (B) on (A) 
so as to form a T’; just cover the line A-B and witha 
knife point make a mark for line C-D. Now square 
line C-D. On piece (B) in a like manner draw the 
shoulder line. From the working faces only gage the 
depth of A-E on both pieces. 
Step 2.—Place (A) in a horizontal position in the 
vise. With a back-saw, cut to the inside of lines A-B 
and C-D, to almost touch line E-F. 
Step 3.—In a similar manner, cut the shoulder of 
piece (B). Holding the chisel with the flat side down, 
cutting but half-way across from each side, remove all 
waste wood, Fig. 8. 
Step 4.—Place the wood on top of the bench and 
eut on line A-B and C-D, Fig. 9. Put the wood in the 
vise again and chisel the corners out clean and true. 
Step 5.—Put the joint together, being careful to 
bring the shoulder up tight.

with a broad chisel, cut down the shoulder. Now put 
the wood in the vise again and, cutting across the 
grain, shave down to line E-F’ 
Step 6.—Superimpose (A) on (B) and from (A), 
using a very sharp pencil or knife, lay off lines A’-B’ 
and C’-D’. Now use the marking gage, set as before, 
and from the working face gage line G’-E’ on both 
edges. . 
Step 7.—Place (B) in a horizontal position in the 
vise; using a back-saw, cut to the inside of lines A’-B’ 
and C’-D’, to the line G’-E’. 
Step 8.—With a broad chisel, held flat side down, 
working half-way from both edges, shave off all waste 
wood. Clean out the corners. 
Step 9.—Undercut the sides of the dovetail slightly 
to insure a tight joint on the face. Place glue on both 
members and put together. 
SPLICED AND FISHED JOINT—PLATE X 
Altho the spliced joint without the reinforced pieces 
is used to some extent in joinery, its real value is in 
carpentry work, and then mostly on heavy timber con- 
struction. This joint is made in much the same manner 
as the end-lap joint.

  54 JOINTS AND HOW THEY ARE MADE 
NOTCHED JOINT 
As Plate X indicates, this form of joint is used 
largely in framing construction. It differs from the 
other types in that more or less than half of the joint 
is cut away. The only precautions to take are: (1) All 
gaging must be from the working face; (2) Where a 
number of pieces are to be made alike, it is best to 
square across several at one time, Fig. 26.

MORTISE-AND-TENON JOINTS—P tate XI 
In order to avoid too much repetition, the student 
is asked to refer to the Pinned-Thru Mortise-and- 
Tenon for more detailed information. 
BLIND MORTISE-AND-TENON JOINT—PLATE XI 
As stated in connection with Plate III, the mortise- 
and-tenon joint is by far the most powerful form of 
construction for the leg-and-rail or stile-and-rail type. 
This joint differs from the thru: mortise-and-tenon 
joint in that the tenon does not extend all the way 
thru, hence no joint is visible from the outside. The. 
blind type of mortise-and-tenon joint is used in place 
of the thru type where there would be an objection to 
the end grain of the tenon on one edge; also it should 
be used where the width of the stile or rail is too great 
for a thru mortise. In that case the glued joint would 
be weakened, rather than strengthened, by the tenon 
breaking away from the mortise on account of 
shrinkage. 
Step 1.—Dress all stock to the correct size. © 
Step 2.—Lay out the joint, on both pieces, gaging 
from the working face only. Since this joint does not 
extend all the way thru, it must be marked on only 
one edge. 
Step 3.—Bore holes and cut out the mortise, making 
the depth a little greater than the length of the tenon 
to give the superfluous glue a place to go. 
Step 4.—Cut the tenon to fit. 
55
-P-A-G-E-56
  56 JOINTS AND HOW THEY ARE MADE 
Step 5.—Glue together, being careful not to put too 
much glue in the mortise, as forcing the joint together 
may cause the joint to split. Remember that liquid 
can not be compressed. 
STUB MORTISE-AND-TENON JOINT—PLATE XI 
This form of mortise-and-tenon joint is used in ear- 
pentry and cabinet work, where its function is to keep 
piece (A) from moving along piece (B) in a sidewise 
motion, the weight from above keeping the tenon in 
the mortise. In former times the studs were let into 
the sill by this form of mortise-and-tenon joint. The 
tenon is made with a shoulder on two sides only. 
HOUSED MORTISE-AND-TENON JOINT—PLATE XI 
Wherever the entire end of one member is let into 
a mortise (its own size) for some distance, we speak 
of it as being ‘‘housed in’’—hence the name, housed 
mortise-and-tenon joint. 
This joint is used to a large extent on handrail work 
for stairs and also for some purposes in cabinet work. 
Step 1—Dress all stock to size and lay out the 
mortise. 
Step 2.—Cut the mortise as a blind mortise is cut, 
making it a little smaller than the size of the rail to be 
let in. 
Step 3.—Try to assemble the joint. If it does not 
come together, dress off the rail to the required size. 
SLIP OR END MORTISE-AND-TENON JOINT PLATE XI 
For cheap, durable construction on light framework 
this joint answers the purpose very well. It has its

  58 JOINTS AND HOW THEY ARE MADE 
Step 1.—Dress all stock to size, being careful to 
mark the working face and edge. Lay out the joint 
on both pieces (A) and (B). 
Step 2.—On piece (A) bore one hole, 7%” less in 
diameter than the mortise, close to the bottom of the 
joint D-F, working half-way from both sides. 
Step 3.—Using a back-saw, saw down close to the 
lines C-D and E-F’. Chisel out the end D-F' clean. 
Step 4.—Cut the tenon in the manner explained 
under Pinned Thru Mortise-and-Tenon Joint. 
This entire joint can be cut on a circular saw, which 
makes it possible to do the work inexpensively. 
KEYED MORTISE-AND-TENON JOINT—PLATE XI 
Like the pinned mortise-and-tenon joint, this joint 
will hold together without glue; in fact, no glue should 
be used on a keyed mortise-and-tenon joint, as its one 
advantage is that furniture made with this form of 
construction can be knocked down. It is also used on 
heavy ornamental work and benches. 
Step 1.—Dress all stock to size and lay out-the mor- 
tise and tenon in the usual manner, except that the 
tenon must be extra long to allow for the key. 
Step 2.—Cut the mortise and tenon as for the pinned 
thru joint. 
Step 3.—Put the joint together, so as to obtain line 
A-B. Take the joint apart and lay out A-B, C-D, E-F 
and G-H, bringing line A-B and C-D about zy” closer 
to the shoulder. This gives the wedge a chance to force 
the joint up tight. 
Step 4.—Cut this mortise, A-B, C-D, E-F', and G-H, 
as other thru mortise.
-P-A-G-E-59
  MORTISE-AND-TENON JOINTS 59 
Step 5.—Cut the wedge to fit. 
TUSK TENON JOINT—PLATE XI 
This form of mortise-and-tenon joint is used only in 
framing construction, for the trimmer and header 
around stair wells and chimneys. It has, however, 
been replaced to a large extent today by iron hangers. 
This joint is also made not to extend all the way thru. 
It is very strong and is quite similar to the keyed joint. 
Execute the making of this joint as you did that of 
the keyed mortise-and-tenon joint, being careful to lay 
out the work accurately.

  MISCELLANEOUS JOINTS—P uate XII 
BUTT JOINT—PLATE XII 
When the end of one piece of wood is placed against 
the side of another it is spoken of as being a butt joint. 
A box nailed together at the corners with the ends 
cut at right angles will illustrate the point. 
BUTT TOE-NAILED JOINT—PLATE XII 
This joint is used almost exclusively in framing con- 
struction. As shown on Plate XII, the nails are driven 
in at an angle thru the corner. 
GLUED AND BLOCKED JOINT—PLATE XII 
In cabinet work it is often necessary to bring one 
member or section against another and to fasten 
it with a glued joint. The block is glued (with a 
rubbed joint) on the back or inside to reinforce the 
joint. 
END-TO-END BUTT BOLTED JOINT—PLATE XII 
The best example of this type of construction can 
be found in handrails of stairs. The joint is butted 
together; two small dowels are worked in to prevent 
the rail from swiveling; the bolt, threaded on both 
ends, is inserted; and then the round nuts are put in 
place from the under side. Holes sufficient in size 
must be bored previously to allow for the nut. These 
nuts must have about six small holes on the edge, 
whereby they can be screwed up by means of a nailset. 
After the joint has been brought together tight, 
60 :
-P-A-G-E-61
  
MISCELLANEOUS JOINTS 61 
the holes are closed with wooden turned plugs glued 
in place. 
DRAW-BOLT .JOINT—PLATE XII 
For the construction of any heavy frame which must 
stand a great deal of rocking, the draw-bolt is the best. 
Step 1.—Butt the joints together and lay out for the 
two dowels, A and B. 
Step 2.—Make the dowel joint as described under 
Dowel Joints and assemble. 
Step 3—Bore a hole for the bolt of sufficient size 
and depth. 
Step 4.—Mortise out for the nut. Note: If a car- 
riage bolt is used, the mortise must be large enough 
to allow for the turning of the nut; where a machine 
bolt is used, this is not necessary. 
EDGE-TO-EDGE GLUED JOINT—PLATE XII 
It is often impossible, and sometimes inadvisable, to 
use one wide board for a certain purpose. In such - 
a case, the boards are frequently glued together as 
illustrated on Plate XII. Since wood shrinks, it is 
wise, in gluing boards edge to edge, to plane them tight 
on the ends with a slight opening in the center. The 
joint can be forced together in the center with clamps 
and held with glue until the shrinking will take up 
the strain. Be sure to keep the edges square. 
GLUED WITH SPLINE JOINT—PLATE XII 
This joint is used for flat surfaces and is simply 
one step further than the edge-to-edge glued joint, in 
that a spline has been added. Where greater strength 
is required this joint is to be used.
-P-A-G-E-62
62 JOINTS AND HOW THEY ARE MADE

of a spline or simply glued and reinforced with cor- 
rugated fasteners. Fig 23.

Step 1.—Plane a working face to use as the out- 
side. 
Step 2.—Plane the desired bevel, testing it from the 
working face. Placing the work on a full-sized 
drawing will greatly help in obtaining the correct 
angle. 
Step 3.—If a spline is to be used, cut the grooves 
on a circular-saw at right angles to the bevel and close 
to the heel (back of the joint).
-P-A-G-E-64
  64 JOINTS AND HOW THEY ARE MADE 
Step 4.—Cut the spline to fit with slight pressure. 
Note the direction of the grain of the spline. 
Step 5.—By means of a rubbed joint, glue the ears 
on for a grip while adjusting. Fig. 23. 
Step 6.—Using handscrews that can be fastened at 
an angle, put glue on both edges, then on the spline, 
and bring the joint together. | 
Step 7.—After the work has set, plane off the ears. 
If corrugated fasteners are to be used, drive them in 
with a hammer after gluing. 
MATCHED-AND-BEADED JOINT—PLATE XII 
Matched lumber is sometimes spoken of as tongue- 
and-grooved. Where any quantity of this material is 
needed, it is advisable to purchase it from a mill. 
Matched-and-beaded lumber is also called ceiling, as it 
is most commonly used for that purpose. 
Step 1—By means of a matching plane or plow, 
work out the groove on one edge and a tongue on the 
other, being careful to work from a working face only. 
Step 2.—With a side-bead plane, work out the bead 
on the tongue edge of the lumber. Before making the 
bead, remove the sharp corner with a jack-plane. 
MATCHED LUMBER—PLATE XII 
Matched lumber is usually blind nailed. The 
matching helps to keep all boards in line, to avoid an 
opening in case of shrinkage, and the beading makes 
it more difficult to locate the joint. This is especially 
true when the lumber is wide and has a center and 
side bead. At a glance, the lumber would appear to 
be narrow.

BLIND NAILED FLOORING—PLATE XII 
Good flooring is always cut away on the under side, 
Plate XII, so that in the event of any irregularities 
the floor will rest on the two extremes. Hardwood 
flooring is matched on the ends also, a fact which 
insures a secure, smooth job. Maple, birch and beech 
floorings are usually bored for starting the nails. Care 
must be taken not to bruise the edge of the fiooring 
in nailing, or to split off the tongue. 
SHIP-LAP JOINT—PLATE XII

serves much the same purpose as matched lumber; it

COPED MITER JOINT—PLATE XII 
All inside angles on molding work are intersected 
with a coped miter joint if the work is to be properly 
done. The value of this type of miter joint is that, 
in case of shrinkage, no crack is noticeable,
-P-A-G-E-66
  66 JOINTS AND HOW THEY ARE MADE 
Step 1.—Piece (A) is cut square on the ends and 
runs the entire length of the wall, or wherever intended. 
Step 2.—On piece (B) lay the molding in the miter- 
box in the proper position and make a cut at 45°. The 
proper position for such a cut can best be studied out 
for each particular molding. 
Step 3.—Use a coping saw or knife and cut away 
the wood to follow the line cut in the miter-box, but 
at right angles to the molding. Figs. 24 and 25.

POINTS WORTH NOTING 
1) Accuracy is one half of the making of a good 
joint; too much emphasis can not be placed on laying 
out the work correctly. 
2) For a series of continued measurements, always 
add along the rule, rather than to slide the rule along. 
Have a common starting point. 
3) Where possible, obtain joint measurements by 
superimposition—for example, the Cross-Lap Joint. 
4) When a number of similar parts are to be made, 
mark them if possible at one time, Fig. 26. . 
    
Fic. 26—Maultiple marking   
  5) Sharp tools make for accurate, speedy work. 
6) Similar operations on a number of different 
pieces should be completed before going on to the next 
step. 
67 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  68 JOINTS AND HOW THEY ARE MADE 
7) Always lay out a joint so as not to weaken any 
member unduly. Cut as much as possible on the 
neutral axis. 
8) Remember that wood shrinks mostly across the 
erain—shrinkage with the grain is not very noticeable 
—therefore, avoid gluing too great a portion of one 
member across the grain of another. Also, on large, 
flat surfaces, allow for this shrinkage by not making 
the entire surface secure. It must expand and con- 
tract (table tops and drawing boards). 
9) Have a firm bench beneath your work to avoid 
springing. 
10) Support and hold your tools and work under 
control, to avoid slipping and thereby ruining the work 
and injuring yourself. 
11) Use broad and short chisels where possible. 
12) Make a final trial fitting before attempting to 
assemble most joints. Have all clamps set and ready. 
13) Before gluing, mark clearly the joints that fit 
together—as 1 and 2. 
14) Make the mortise deep enough to allow the glue 
some place to go. Liquid cannot be compressed. 
15) Joints must be fitted together, not driven te- 
gether. 
16) The theory of gluing is to allow the glue to 
penetrate in the pores of both members so as to make 
a union. Do not try to fill up a poor joint with glue. 
Glue shrinks in drying and will break away from the 
wood. 
17) Glue must be thin enough to run freely and hot 
enough to penetrate; it must be worked quickly.
-P-A-G-E-69
POINTS WORTH NOTING 69 
18) For work exposed to the weather, use a water 
proof glue. 
19) Use serap wood to hammer on and to clamp 
igainst. By doing this the wood of your joint is not 
oruised. 
20) Cut mortise members first and fit the tenon to 
them. 
21) Where it does not show or injure contact glu- 
ng, undereut slightly to insure a tight fit on the 
surface. 
22) Take pride in doing good work and in keeping 
the tools in good condition. If possible do not lend 
‘ools. 
23) Remember to form the habit of order. It makes 
ull things in life easier—even joinery work.

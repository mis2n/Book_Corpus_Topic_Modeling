  TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE. 
  Prstatozzr’s “Leonard and Gertrude” was first published in 
the year 1781, when about one fourth of the whole work appeared. 
Three more volumes came out in 1783, 1785 and 1787. In 
1790-92 a second edition, revised and condensed by the author, 
appeared in three volumes. When Pestalozzi collected his works, 
and had them published by Cotta in Stuttgart (1819-26), he 
remodelled the first edition, especially the last. three volumes, 
expanding it to such a degree that the whole work was intended 
to occupy six volumes. Of these, only the first four appeared, 
the manuscript of the fifth being lost after the author’s death. 
Seyffarth’s more modern edition, which fills five volumes, aims to 
hold fast to what is best in the first edition, without losing sight 
of the added material in the third, often calling attention in the 
notes. to the divergence of the two. 
An abridged translation of “Leonard and Gertrude” is beset 
with many difficulties, since the different editions vary consid- 
erably from each other, and it is impossible to hold to one: of 
them consistently throughout. In the preparation of the present 
book, the only accessible material was the following: the cheap 
Reclam edition, comprising the first two volumes aione, and fol- 
lowing in the main the original edition; the expanded but 
‘mcomplete Cotta edition; the eclectic edition of Seyffarth in 
five volumes; and the latter’s shortened popular version in one 
volume (1874). 2

    iv TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE. 
A more tedious style than Pestalozzi’s can hardly be imagined. 
Despite the sound common sense and rare insight into human 
character everywhere displayed, it is impossible to read half a 
dozen pages without a disposition to yawn. This circumstance, 
added to the unwieldy dimensions of the work, may serve as some 
excuse for the wholesale process of abridgment adopted in the 
present volume. Owing to this condensation, much of the quaint 
simplicity of the original has of necessity been sacrificed, although 
it has been retained to some degree in the dialogues. The scenes 
with Gertrude and her children have suffered the least mutilation 
of any in the book, since they are not only among the most charm- 
ing, but also possess the greatest value from an educational point 
of view. 
Externally, “Leonard and Gertrude” occupies a somewhat pe- 
culiar position in literature, since it is neither precisely a story, 
nor a pedagogical treatise. It might rather be called a realistic 
picture of Swiss peasant life in the last century, which if not of 
absorbing interest, yet contains much that is curious and instruc- 
tive concerning old manners and customs. But the moral value 
of the work is far more than this. The village of Bonnal is 
intended to typify the world, and in describing the measures 
taken to reform the corruption and raise the moral. standard of 
this little community, the author expresses his views on some 
of the greatest social and political questions of all ages. His 
opinions and theories on educational topics are scattered inci- 
dentally throughout the book, although they find their fullest 
expression in Chapters VIII, X, XVI, XVII, XXIII, XXV, 
XXXI, XXXII. 
It is hoped that the present shortened version of “Leonard 
and Gertrude,” despite its many imperfections, may secure for 
this remarkable book of a remarkable man a still wider and 
more appreciative circle of readers than it has hitherto found.

INTRODUCTION. 
  Tuis homely tale was not written for the modern novel-reader. 
It is a story of deep and ardent love, not for an individual, 
but for the wretched, the weak, and for children. Though he 
wrote much, the author could tell no tale but this. Its purpose 
was his earnest inner life, and its details a picture of his own 
surroundings, as humble and as realistically depicted as anything 
in Heyse or Auerbach. It is of peasants who kick tkeir wives, 
of hungry children who steal a handful of raw potatoes, and who 
only on gala-days have the cream left on their milk; of literal 
dunghills and stable-drains. It is, moreover, fairly packed with 
incident and character. The hypocrite, the fool, the gossip, the 
miser, the sot, the sycophant, the schemer, the just judge, the good 
parson, the intriguing woman from the court, the old schoolmaster 
enraged at a new departure in education, the quack doctor sen- 
tenced to dig the graves of those he kills, and many more, stand 
out from these pages in as sharp relief as words can well paint 
them. The action is all intense. The bailiff’s wife runs home 
from church as fast as her legs can carry her; her husband 
is repeatedly so terrified he cannot speak; and his accomplice 
rolls on the floor in his remorse, and beats himself with his 
fists. The death of Rudy’s mother is full of pathos. The pur- 
suit of Hummel by the devil is extremely humorous; the 
scene under the gallows, where he confesses himself willing 
to die, and where his fingers are indelibly stained, is very 
impressive.

  vi INTRODUCTION. 
Moreover, as a picture of a somewhat primitive village com. 
munity, the story is replete with interest and instruction. The 
large public square where the people assemble; the extensive 
common, the division of which among individual proprietors is 
one thread of interest throughout the book; the public hang- 
man’s tree; the bailiff beer-house keeper, with everybody in his 
debt, listening at the windows, extracting the domestic secrets 
of all his customers; the petty thieveries and deceits and 
superstitions; the intrigues, scandals, lies, amidst which nothing 
thrived but the beer-house; and lastly the great, beneficent magis- 
trate in the old manor-house in the distant background, watch- 
ing like a good Providence over all the affairs of the hamlet, 
and meting out justice in the market, and whom no one could 
deceive or thwart, — these scenes are all as strange to us as they* 
were real to Pestalozzi. The art, in a word, reminds one of 
that of the large, colored charts, for combined language and 
object teaching, on the walls of so many German schoolrooms, — 
masses of strong colors, a crowd of things and persons, without 
attempted art or unity, but far truer to and richer in life, for 
a child’s eye, than anything in the art galleries. Unlike these 
charts, however, it has a purpose which lifts it far above these 
details to a moral plain, the highest to which literary art can 
attain. 
There was one good woman in this dismal hamlet, — Ger- 
trude, the mason’s wife, who trudged many miles one day to 
see the county magistrate, and beg work for her husband, and 
to complain of the bad arts of the wicked bailiff, whose beer 
made her husband drunk. Her faltering story was heard, and 
her husband obtained the job of building a new church; and 
at length, after a long struggle, the bailiff was exposed and fell. 
Gertrude had taught her own children home industries and 
maxims, hymns, prayers, and cleanliness and courtesy, and final]

-P-A-G-E-7
  INTRODUCTION. vii 
allowed the children of a neighbor to come in. An idle man of 
a noble but decayed family witnessed her home-school, and at 
length resolved to be a schoolmaster himself. Gertrude could 
not tell him much of her secret, though occasionally she let fall 
a “key-word.” She felt that the school should stand in the 
closest relation with home life, and not in opposition to it; 
that it should be a larger circle drawn about the fireside 
hearth; that verbal instruction should vanish in the spirit of 
real activity. The schoolmaster’s establishment flourished. The 
preacher was interested, and realized that his sermons were too 
refined and doctrinal, and not practical, and changed his style. 
The whole spirit of home life and of industry gradually revived. 
A few of the best citizens met weekly to discuss the larger 
educational question of commercial prosperity. The royal cabi- 
net became interested, studied Bonnal,— which had become the 
thriftiest hamlet in Switzerland, — and at length concluded, that, 
if the ministry of a realm should seriously and deeply desire 
reform, they could set about it in no better or more radical 
way than by imitating Bonnal. Here was, in fact, the prin- 
ciple of universal government. 
Thus Bonnal is the world; the bailiff is intemperance, in- 
trigue, and all influences which degrade society; and Gertrude 
is the Good Teacher by whom alone the world is to be saved, 
if it is to be saved at all. We shall not read this story as we 
ought if we forget that there are hundreds of communities in 
our land to-day in the same need as was Bonnal of a regenera- 
tion so radical that only these_same_slow methods of’ practical, 
ethical education can ever accomplish it. Such a regeneration 
is not to be effected by endowments, legislation, or by new 
methods, important as these are, but, as Pestalozzi thought, by 
the love and devotion of noble women overflowing from the 
domestic circle into the community, by the good Gertrudes of all

stations in life, the born educators of the race, whose work and 
whose “key-words” we men-pedagogues must ponder well if our 
teaching is to be ethically inspired. 
This book represents the culmination of Pestalozzi’s influ- 
ence. Royal personages came to see him, and gave him pres- 
ents. Herbart, Fichte, and many others, lit their torches at 
the fire he kindled here. This is a book which all good 
teachers should read with care, and, having read it, will 
thank the translator for the great and discriminating labor 
she has spent upon the very voluminous and intractable original 
in converting it into the present pleasing form.

LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
——20#400—_ 
CHAPTER I. 
A WEAK MAN, A BRAVE WOMAN, AND A FATHERLY RULER. 
4” the village of Bonnal there lived a mason named 
Leonard. His trade would have enabled him to sup- 
port his family of a wife and seven children, if he could 
have resisted the temptation to frequent the tavern, where 
there were always enough idle loafers to entice him in, and 
induce the good-natured, easy-going man to squander his 
earnings in drink and gambling. Leonard always repented 
his weakness when he saw his children want for bread, yet 
was not strong enough to reform. He was blest with a 
good, pious wife, who was overwhelmed with sorrow at the 
ruin which seemed to stare them in the face. 
Gertrude had always contrived to conceal her sadness 
from the children, but one day, when her husband remained 
away from home longer than usual, she was so overcome 
with anxiety and grief that the little ones saw her weep. 
‘You are crying, mother!” they exclaimed in chorus, and 
crowding about her, added their tears to hers. Even the 
baby in her arms seemed to feel a premonition of sorrow, 
and looked up in her face for the first time without a smile. 
This was too much for the afflicted mother, who now wept 
aloud, accompanied by the sobs of the children. Their 
grief was at its height when the door opened, and Leonard
-P-A-G-E-12
  2 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
entered. Gertrude’s face was hidden, and the children were 
clinging about her, too much engrossed with their mother’s 
distress to notice the approach of their father. 
‘¢ Merciful heavens, what is it?” he cried, turning pale 
as death. They looked up at the sound of his voice, and 
the violence of their lamentation ceased. ‘‘ Gertrude, what 
dreadful sorrow is this? ’’ he asked again. 
‘‘Dear husband, heavy cares oppress my heart, and when 
you are away, my misery is still greater.” 
“ Gertrude,” said Leonard; ‘‘ I know why you weep, — 
wretch that I am!” 
She led the children away, and Leonard laid his head in 
her lap without speaking. The quiet was broken only by 
his sobs, for Gertrude was praying silently. Finally she 
spoke: ‘‘ Leonard, trust in God’s mercy, and take courage 
to do right!” 
‘©O Gertrude!” was all he could say amid his tears. 
‘‘ Take courage, dear,” she repeated, ‘‘and trust in your 
Father in heaven. I would not willingly grieve you, and 
you well know that I do not ask for more than bread and 
water at your side; and that I often work uncomplainingly 
till long past midnight for you and the children. But, hus- 
band, I should not feel I was true to you or our dear ones 
if I concealed my cares from you. Our children are loving 
and dutiful now; but they will not remain so if we do not 
fulfil our obligation as parents. Think how you would feel 
if all our little ones should lose their gratitude and respect 
for us through our fault! And could you bear to see your 
Nicholas, your Jonas, your Lizzie and Annie, homeless and 
forced to seek their bread among strangers? It would kill 
me!” and her tears flowed as she spoke. 
Leonard wept also. ‘*O Gertrude, what shall I do? It 
breaks my heart to make you miserable, but I cannot help it. 
I owe the Bailiff Hummel thirty florins, and if I stay away
-P-A-G-E-13
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 3 
from his tavern, he threatens me with the law; yet if I go, 
he gets possession of all my wages.” 
‘Can you not go to Arner, the people’s father? All the 
widows and orphans praise him, and I think he would give 
you advice and protection.” 
‘‘ Gertrude, I dare not! How could I, a poor miserable 
drunkard, complain of the Bailiff, who has a thousand ways 
of blackening me in the eyes of his superior? And think 
how he would revenge himself if I should try it and fail!” 
‘¢But he will ruin you in any case. Leonard, think of 
your children, and go. If you do not, I shall!” 
‘‘T dare not! But, Gertrude, if you have the courage, go 
to Arner in Heaven’s name, and tell him all.” 
“J will!” she answered. She prayed throughout the 
sleepless night, and the next morning took her blooming 
baby and walked two long hours to the Castle. 
The nobleman was sitting under a linden-tree at the gate, 
and saw her as she approached, with tears in her eyes and 
the infant on her arm. ‘‘ Who are you, my daughter, and 
what do you wish?” he asked, in so kind a tone that she 
took heart to answer: ‘‘I am Gertrude, wife of the mason 
Leonard in Bonnal.” 
‘You are a good woman,” said Arner. ‘‘I have noticed 
that your children behave better than all the others in the 
village, and they seem better fed, although I hear you are 
very poor. What can I do for you, my daughter?” 
‘¢O gracious Sir, for a long time my husband has owed 
thirty florins to the Bailiff Hummel, a hard man, who leads 
him into all sorts of temptation. Leonard is in his power: 
so he dares not keep away from the tavern, where day after 
day he spends the wages which ought to buy bread for his 
family. We have seven little children, Sir, and unless some- 
thing is done we shall all be beggars. I ventured to come to 
you for help, because I know that you have compassion for
-P-A-G-E-14
4 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
the widowed and fatherless. I have brought the money I 
have laid aside for my children, to deposit with you, if you 
will be so good as to make some arrangement so that the 
Bailiff shall not torment my husband any more until he is 
paid.” 
Arner took up a cup which stood near, and said to Ger- 
trude: ‘‘ Drink this tea, and give your pretty baby some of 
this milk.” She blushed, and was moved even to tears by 
his fatherly kindness. 
The nobleman now requested her to relate her causes of 
complaint against the Bailiff, and listened attentively to her 
story of the cares and troubles of many years. Suddenly 
he asked her how it had been possible to lay aside money for 
her children in the midst of her distress. 
“Tt was very hard, gracious Sir; yet I could not help 
feeling as if the money were not mine, but had been given 
me by a dying man on his death-bed, in trust for his chil- 
dren. So when in the hardest times I had to borrow from it 
to buy bread for the family, I gave myself no rest till by 
working late and early I had paid it back again.” 
Gertrude laid seven neat packages on the table, each of 
which had a ticket attached, saying whose it was; and if she 
had taken anything from it, the fact was noted, and likewise 
when she had replaced it. She saw him read these tickets 
through attentively, and said blushing: ‘‘I ought to have 
taken those papers away, gracious Sir.” 
Arner only smiled, and admired the modesty which shrank 
from even merited praise. He added something to each 
parcel, saying: ‘‘ Carry back your children’s money, Ger- 
trude ; I will lay aside thirty florins until the Bailiff is paid. 
Now go home; I shall be in the village to-morrow, at all 
events, and will settle the matter with Hummel.” 
‘*God reward you, gracious Sir!” she faltered; and 
started joyfully with her baby on the long homeward way.
-P-A-G-E-15
  LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 5 
Leonard saw her as she approached the house. ‘‘ Already 
back again?” he cried. ‘You have been successful with 
Arner.” 
“« How do you know?” 
“‘T can see it in your face, my dear wife,— you cannot 
deceive me.” 
From this time forward, when the mason’s children said 
their prayers at morning and evening, they prayed not only 
for their father and mother, but also for Arner, the people’s 
father.
-P-A-G-E-16
§ LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
CHAPTER II. 
A TYRANT APPEARS, AND FINDS HIS MASTER. 
Tar evening, when the Bailiff went to Arner for orders, 
the latter remarked: ‘‘I am coming to Bonnal myself 
to-morrow; I want to arrange about the building of the 
church.” 
‘Is your Grace’s master-mason at liberty now, gracious 
Sin?! 
‘* No; but there is a mason in your village, named Leon- 
ard, whom I should be glad to employ. Why have you 
never recommended him to me before?” 
With a low bow the Bailiff replied: ‘‘I should not have 
dared to recommend the poor mason for any of your Wor- 
ship’s buildings.” 
“Ts he a reliable man?” 
‘Yes, your Grace may depend upon him; he is faithful- 
ness itself.” 
‘They say he has an excellent wife; are you sure she is 
no busybody?”’ inquired Arner with emphasis. 
‘“*No; she is really a quiet, industrious woman.” : 
“Very well; be at the churchyard at nine to-morrow 
morning. I will meet you there.’’ 
Soon after this conversation, the Bailiff was knocking vio- 
lently at the door of the mason’s little hut, where Leonard 
and Gertrude were still sitting at the supper-table. The 
mason recognized the voice of the envious Bailiff, and hastily 
pushing the food into a corner, he turned deadly pale as he 
went to open the door.
-P-A-G-E-17
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. q 
Like a hungry hound, the Bailiff scented the hidden viands, 
but spoke with feigned friendliness: ‘‘ You are. having an 
easy time, my good people; it’s not so hard to do without 
the tavern, is it, Leonard?” 
The mason cast down his eyes in silence, but Gertrude was 
bolder. ‘‘ What are your commands, Sir Bailiff?” she said. 
‘¢T wonder you should come nearer than the window of so 
poor a house as this.” 
Concealing his anger, Hummel answered with a smile: 
“It is true I should not have expected to find such good 
fare here, or I might have called oftener.”’ 
This irritated Gertrude. ‘‘ Bailiff!” she exclaimed, 
‘¢ you smell our supper, and grudge it to us. You ought to 
be ashamed to spoil a poor man’s meal, when perhaps he 
doesn’t get so good a one three times a year.” 
“That was not my intention,” returned the magistrate, 
still witha smile. But the next moment he added seriously : 
‘¢ You are too inclined to be insolent, Gertrude, which does 
not become poor people. It might be worth your while to 
reflect that you may perhaps have some dealings with me 
yet, —but enough of that! I am always well disposed 
toward your husband, and can give you proofs of it.” 
‘¢My husband is enticed into drinking and gaming every 
day in your tavern, and afterwards I with my children have 
to suffer every misery at home; that is the service we owe 
you!”’ 
‘¢You wrong me, Gertrude. It is true your husband is 
rather a sorry fellow, and I have told him so myself; but in 
my tavern I must give food and drink to every one who asks 
for it. Everybody does the same.” 
‘“‘ Yes; but not everybody threatens a poor man with the 
law, if he does not double his debts every year.” 
Furiously the Bailiff turned to Leonard. ‘‘ Are these the 
sort of tales you tell of me, you rascal? It’s lucky I have
-P-A-G-E-18
ee er ee ean 
8 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
all your bills and memoranda in my hands! Perhaps you 
will venture to dispute my claims?” 
‘‘That would not enter my head,” said Leonard. ‘‘ Ger- 
trude is only anxious for me to make no new debts.” 
Controlling himself, Hummel observed in a milder tone: 
“There’s no great harm in that; but you are the man of 
the house, and she certainly will not want to tie you to her 
apron-strings.” 
‘‘By no means, Bailiff,” said Gertrude. ‘On the con- 
trary, I would like to free him from the bonds which already 
hold him ; that is, your book, Sir Bailiff, and your fine mem- 
oranda.” 
‘¢ He has only to pay me, and then he will be free as air.” 
‘¢ That he will be able to do, if he makes no fresh debts.” 
‘*You are proud, Gertrude, — but we will see! I imagine 
you would rather have your husband feast at home with you 
than drink a glass of wine with me.” 
“That is contemptible, Bailiff! but your words have no 
power to hurt me.” 
Hummel could bear it no longer, and took an abrupt leave, 
wondering what could have occurred to make Gertrude so 
bold. It was almost midnight before he reached home, but 
he sent immediately for two of Leonard’s neighbors, who 
rose from their beds and came at once, in obedience to his 
summons. The Bailiff questioned them narrowly concerning 
the pursuits of the mason’s family during the last few days, 
and when nothing came to light which could explain the 
mystery, he flew into a violent passion. ‘‘ You dogs! There 
is no getting anything out of you! And yet when you carry 
off whole cartloads of wood from Arner’s premises, and 
turn your cattle into his pastures to graze, you expect me to 
say nothing about it! Buller, more than a third of your 
reckoning was false, but I was silent. And Kriiel, half of 
your meadow belongs by good rights to your brother’s chib  
-P-A-G-E-19
  LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 9 
dren, — what if I should have you hung, as you richly de- 
serve?” : 
This threat seemed to stimulate Kriiel’s memory, for he at 
once began: ‘‘Stop a minute, Bailiff, —I think I can help 
you. It just crosses my mind that Gertrude was away all 
this morning ; and to-night her Lizzie was praising Arner at 
the well; she must have been at the Castle. Then last night 
there was a loud sound of crying from their house, and to- 
day they are all as merry as larks.’’ 
The Bailiff dismissed his informants, bidding them keep 
silence in regard to their discoveries, and do their best to 
bring him fresh information as soon as possible. In the 
morning he went again to the mason’s house, and after a 
friendly greeting, said: ‘‘ Leonard, we parted in anger last 
night, but that must not be. I have good news for you. I 
have just been with our gracious master, who was talking 
about building the church. He asked about you, and I told 
him I thought you were equal to the undertaking ; so I think 
he will give it to you.” 
‘« But he arranged with his master-mason about the build- 
ing, — you said so yourself long ago.” 
‘“<T thought it was so, but I was mistaken; the mason only 
made an estimate of expenses, and didn’t forget himself, 
you may believe. If you can get the job on the basis of 
this calculation, you will hook in your money by the armful. 
Now you can judge whether I am your friend or not!” 
The mason was so happy that he thanked the Bailiff grate- 
fully ; but Gertrude saw plainly that their treacherous guest 
already had an eye to the wages her husband would earn in 
his new employment. As he departed, the Bailiff remarked: 
‘¢ Arner will be here in an hour”; and Lizzie, who stood by 
her father’s side, spoke up: ‘‘ Yes, we have known that since 
yesterday.” Hummel started at the words, but paid no at- 
tention to them.
-P-A-G-E-20
  10 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
In the mean time, Arner had reached the churchyard, 
where a crowd of the villagers had assembled to look on 
their good master. ‘‘ Have you nothing to do, or is it a holi- 
day, that you all have time to loaf about here?” asked the 
Bailiff of those who stood nearest; but Arner said aloud: 
+ Bailiff, I am very willing for all my children to remain and 
hear my wishes with regard to the building; why do you 
drive them away?” Hummel bent himself to the ground, 
and called out to the neighbors: ‘‘Come back, his Grace 
has no objection.” 
Arner asked the Bailiff if he had seen the estimate for the 
building, and whether he thought Leonard could make it 
good and durable at the given price. ‘‘ Yes, gracious Sir,” 
replied Hummel, adding in a lower tone: ‘‘I think perhaps 
he might even do it a little cheaper, as he lives in the vil- 
lage.” 
But Arner said aloud: ‘‘I will give him just the same I 
should have given the master-mason. Send for him, and see 
that everything is delivered to him from the storehouses 
which the master-mason would have had.” 
The messenger soon returned, and the Bailiff turned deadly 
pale on remarking that he was accompanied by Gertrude, 
who had decided to come herself in her husband’s absence. 
‘¢ What is the matter, Sir Bailiff?’’ inquired Arner. 
“‘ Nothing, gracious Sir; I didn’t sleep well last night, 
thas is all.” 
‘You look as if you had not,” replied Arner, looking fix- 
edly into his inflamed eyes. Then turning to Gertrude with 
a pleasant greeting, he asked: ‘‘Is not your husband here? 
But no matter, you can simply tell him to come tome. I 
am going to intrust the building of the church to him.” 
Gertrude stood silent, too much abashed to utter a word 
in the presence of so many people. ‘‘ Why do you not 
speak, Gertrude?” said Arner. ‘You must be delighted
-P-A-G-E-21
  LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 11 
to learn that your husband is to have the building on the 
same terms agreed upon for the master-mason.” 
Gertrude rallied sufficiently to stammer: ‘‘Gracious Sir, 
the church is so near the tavern ! ” 
Everybody began to laugh, and the Bailiff cried angrily to 
Gertrude: ‘‘ What have you against my tavern? ” 
Arner interrupted him with: ‘‘ Pray, is this your affair, 
Bailiff?” and turning to the mason’s wife, demanded an 
explanation of her words. 
‘Gracious Sir, my husband is easily enticed into drinking, 
and if he has to work so near the tavern every day, I am 
afraid he will not be able to resist the temptation. One gets 
thirsty working, Sir, and if all the time there are people 
before his eyes drinking and betting, and teasing him to join 
them, how can he help listening? And if he is once in debt 
again, it is all over with him. O Sir, if you only knew how 
a single evening in such a house can bring a man into slay- 
ery from which it is hardly possible to escape!” 
“<I do know it, Gertrude, and I mean to show the whole 
world that I am not going to let the poor people be oppressed 
and abused.” Then turning to the Bailiff with a penetrating 
look, he demanded: ‘‘Is it true that the poor people are 
enticed into your house, and then cheated and oppressed?” 
Pale as death Hummel stammered : ‘‘ No, indeed, gracious 
Sir! That’s the reward a man gets for serving beggars !” 
‘But the question is, whether this woman speaks falsely.” 
‘‘Indeed she does, gracious Sir! I will prove it in a thou- 
sand ways.” 
‘One is quite sufficient, Bailiff. But take care! Yester- 
day you said Gertrude was an industrious woman, and no 
busybody.’” 
The Bailiff was so confused at this that he could bring 
forth no intelligible answer, and Arner turned for confirma- 
tion to two old men who stood near. ‘‘Is it true, my good
-P-A-G-E-22
  12 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
neighbors, that people are oppressed and ruined in your tav- 
erm?” 
The men looked at each other, but did not speak. ‘‘ Do 
not be afraid, — tell me the simple truth.” 
“Tt is but too true, gracious Sir; but how can we com- 
plain against the Bailiff?” replied the older of the two, so 
low that only Arner could distinguish the words. 
“Tt is enough,” said the nobleman, turning again to 
Hummel. ‘‘It was not my intention to investigate this com- 
plaint to-day, but I am determined to protect my people 
from every sort of oppression, and I have long thought that 
no bailiff ought to keep a tavern. But we will postpone that 
matter until Monday. — Gertrude, tell your husband to come 
to me, and be quite easy as regards the tavern.”

CHAPTER III. 
HOW PEASANTS TALK, AND ROGUES PLAN. 
Tux Bailiff did not go home until evening, and when he 
approached his house, usually brilliantly lighted, and noisy 
with the sounds of revelry, he was terrified to observe that 
all was dark and still. He rushed in, and found no one but 
his wife, who was sobbing ina corner. ‘‘O husband, is 
that you?” she cried. ‘‘ What a misfortune has befallen us! 
All our enemies are exulting, and not a man in the village 
dares to drink a glass of wine at our house.” 
Hummel was almost beside himself with rage, and: spent 
a large part of the night in plotting vengeance against the 
author of his misfortunes. The next morning, however, 
he resolved to put a good face on the matter, and began 
whistling merrily under his open window. His neighbor 
Fritz called out to him: ‘‘ Have you customers so early, 
that you are in such good spirits?” 
‘Oh, theyll be coming before long. Will you drink my 
health, Fritz?” — holding a glass of brandy out of the 
window. 
‘¢ It is too early: I’ll wait till there is more company.’’ 
‘¢You always were full of your fun. But you needn’t 
think that business of yesterday is going to turn out so 
badly. No bird flies so high that it doesn’t come down 
again!” 
“°T don’t know about that,” remarked Fritz. ‘‘ The bird 
Ihave in mind has had a long enough flight. But we may 
not be speaking of the same bird. Hallo! They are call-
-P-A-G-E-24
  14 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
ing me to breakfast,” —and he closed the window as he 
spoke, leaving the Bailiff to no very agreeable reflections. 
Soon after, Hummel started for the barber’s, with a defi- 
nite end in view. On his way he met Nickel Spitz, who thus 
accosted him: ‘‘ Where are you going in your Sunday 
clothes, Sir Bailiff? ” 
‘To the barber’s.” 
‘¢Tt’s queer you are at leisure on Saturday morning.” 
“To be sure, it is not so all the year round; but come 
with me,—there will perhaps be some drinking, or fun of 
some sort.” 
‘‘T imagine you would have a reckoning with the barber, 
if he had any wine drunk in his house!” exclaimed Nickel. 
“‘T am not so selfish as all that. Indeed, they talk of 
taking away my license altogether; but, Nickel, it will be 
some time yet before that comes to pass.” 
‘¢ You are about right there. But it isn’t the best luck in 
the world for you that our young master has a different 
creed from his grandfather. I suspect they differed about 
every article of the twelve.” 
“‘Very possibly,” observed Hummel. ‘+ Yet the old 
man’s belief was more to my mind.” 
*‘So I should suppose. The first article of his creed 
was: ‘I believe in you, my Bailiff.’ ” 
‘¢ Very good ! — and what was the second?” 
‘How should I know? Possibly something like this: ‘1 
don’t believe a word from any man living except you, my 
Bailiff.’ ” 
“Really, Nickel, you ought to have been a parson! You 
might have set up a new Catechism.” 
‘They would hardly have let me do that. I should have 
made it so plain that the children could all have understood 
it without any parson, so that there would have been no need 
of one at all.”
-P-A-G-E-25
  
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 15 
‘¢ Tt is better to stick to the old, Nickel, in the Catechism 
as in everything else; we don’t better ourselves by changing. 
But as far as I am concerned, I am not so much afraid of 
this new master.” 
“Yet your good luck was buried last summer with his 
grandfather.” 
‘¢ Well, Nickel, at all events I have had my share of good 
luck.” 
‘¢ That you have, Sir,—but you couldn’t well have helped 
it. The clerk, the beadle, and the vicar all owed you 
money.” 
‘¢ Fool! You don’t know as much as you think.” 
‘¢I know much more than that! I know what tricxs you 
played on Rudy’s father, and how I caught you lying on 
your face in the straw by the dog-kennel, in front of Rudy’s 
window, while his attorney was with him. You staid there 
listening to what they said till two o’clock in the morning, 
and then it was easy enough for you, with the clerk, to dis- 
tort your own evidence.” 
‘¢ There is not a word of truth in what you say!” 
‘“‘There isn’t? I tell you if the clerk had not changed 
your evidence before the court, Rudy would still be in pos- 
session of his meadow, and Wiist and Kaibacher would not 
have had to perjure themselves.” 
“The best part of it is that I won the lawsuit,” re- 
marked the Bailiff. ‘‘I shouldn’t have liked to have you 
know I had lost it.” 
‘¢ Oh, yes, I know well enough you won it, and also in what 
way!” said Nickel, taking his departure abruptly. 
As the Bailiff entered the barber’s house, where a number 
of the neighbors were already assembled, contrary to his 
wont he greeted them all politely before seating himself ; but 
the peasants were far less deferential than usual, and plainly 
showed their distrust of their magistrate. Seeing this, he
-P-A-G-E-26
  16 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
sent a boy to bring wine from his own house, and placed his 
well-filled tobacco-pouch on the table. A cloud of smoke 
soon arose, and amid the clinking of glasses which followed, 
all prejudices against Hummel were forgotten. The latter 
had previously arranged with his wife that the wine should 
be adulterated with brimstone, and also that a jug of colored 
water should be prepared for his own use. When the heads 
of the peasants were heated, the Bailiff adroitly turned the 
conversation to the rights of the people, insinuating that if 
Arner should get the tavern license into his own hands, the 
price of wine would soon rise. 
Just as the excitement had reached its height, one of the 
half-intoxicated fellows upset the jug at Hummel’s elbow, 
and the barber’s dog, coming up, lapped the colored water 
from the floor. This aroused the wonder of the peasants, 
and led to a discovery of the imposture, whereupon so great 
a tumult arose that the barber requested the rioters to with- 
draw. The enraged Bailiff invited the company to his own 
house, but was followed only by two or three good-for-noth- 
ing loafers. One of these he at once despatched in pursuit 
of the mason’s apprentice Joseph, who soon made his appear- 
ance. 
‘* Good-day, Joseph!” said the Bailiff; ‘‘does your mas- 
ter know you are here?” 
‘¢ He is at the Castle, and will not be back till noon; so 
if I am at work again by one o’clock, he will be none the 
wiser.” 
‘¢ Very well,’ —and leading him into the adjoining apart- 
ment, the Bailiff bolted the door behind them. On the table 
were pork, sausages, bread, and wine. ‘Come, Joseph,” 
said his host; ‘‘ drink a glass, and try these sausages. Do 
help yourself! You haye a hard enough time at your mas- 
ter’s.” 
“Yes,” was the reply ; ‘‘ but now he has work, things will 
go better”
-P-A-G-E-27
  
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 1 
**You are a fool, Joseph! How long do you suppose that 
will last? He is not a competent man for the job, since he 
has never had the charge of a large building before. He 
will depend on you entirely, and for that reason I want to 
ask a favor of you.” 
‘“‘T am at your service, Sir Bailiff. I drink to you!” 
The Bailiff helped him again to sausages, and continued : 
**T should be glad if the foundation of the church could be 
of stone from the Schwendi quarry.” 
‘¢ Impossible, Sir Bailiff! You don’t know what you are 
talking about. This stone is good for nothing as a founda- 
tion.” ‘ 
“‘Oh, I hardly think it is so bad; I have seen it used for 
many purposes. Joseph, I should regard it as a personal 
favor if this quarry could be used.” 
‘* But the walls will rot away in six years’ time if they are 
made of this stone.” 
‘That is all nonsense! And after all, what concern is 
it of yours whether the walls are sound ten years from now? 
Just do as I say, and you shall have reason to be glad of 
it.” 
‘¢ But suppose Arner should notice that the stone is good 
for nothing? He knows more about some things than you 
would think.” 
‘*Pooh! He knows nothing of that. Just give me your 
hand on it, and if your master takes the stone from that 
quarry, you shall have five thalers for yourself.” 
The bargain was concluded, when the Bailiff added: ‘‘ One 
thing more, Joseph. I have a little bag of stuff from the 
apothecary, which is said to make mortar stick to a wall like 
iron, if it is mixed with the lime. But I should like to try it 
on some other building before I use it on any of my own.” 
“ Allright! Tl try it for you on the corner of a neigh. 
bor’s house.”  
-P-A-G-E-28
18 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
“No, Joseph; that would be no test at all. I would like 
to have it tried on the church-tower. Isn’t that possible?” 
“Ts it necessary to put much into the lime?” asked the 
apprentice. 
“A couple of pounds to a barrel, I suppose.” 
‘* That is easy enough.” 
**Then you will do it?” 
‘To be sure.” 
** And hold your tongue if it fails?” 
‘¢ Of course I shall hold my tongue ; and it can’t fail.” 
‘¢ Well, come and get the stuff from me when you need it, 
and a glass of wine into the bargain.” 
‘All right, Sir Bailiff. To your health, and my best 
thanks !”* eried Joseph, quafling a parting glass.

CHAPTER IV. 
HOME Joys. 
Meranwuite, Gertrude had been hurrying to finish her 
Saturday’s work before Leonard came back from the Castle. 
While combing and braiding the children’s hair, mending 
their clothes, and putting the room to rights, she had taught 
the little ones a song, with which to greet their father on his 
return. As the mason entered, wife and children sang in 
chorus :— 
“Gentle peace, who art from heaven, 
Soothing every pain and care, 
Healing with the sweetest balsam 
Those who most are in despair, 
Iam weary of this striving, 
I am longing for a rest, — 
Higher thou than pain or pleasure, 
Come and dwell within my breast!” 
‘God bless you!” cried Leonard, with tears in his eyes. 
‘My dear husband,” said Gertrude, ‘‘earth becomes 
heaven when we seek for peace, do right, and wish for 
little.” 
“Tf Lever enjoy this heaven on earth, I owe it to you! 
I shall thank you all my life for saving me, and so will our 
little ones. — Children, do right, and follow in your mother’s 
footsteps ; then you will prosper.” 
‘You seem in good spirits to-day,” remarked Gertrude 
presently. 
‘‘T have had a successful interview with Arner. To think 
how childishly I behaved about going to him!”
-P-A-G-E-30
  20 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
“It is always easy enough to be wise after the event. 
But now tell me the whole story,” she besought, taking up 
her knitting. 
‘* But, my dear wife, it is Saturday, and you wouldn’t have 
time to hear it all.” 
*¢ Just look about you,” said Gertrude, with a smile. 
‘¢She has hurried, father,” spoke up Lizzie. ‘‘ Annie 
and I helped her clear up.” 
“* Now do begin!” begged Gertrude. 
‘¢ Well, Arner even asked me my father’s name, and what 
street I live in, and the number of my house.” 
‘*JT know better, Leonard! That certainly was not the 
way he began.” 
‘¢ Why not, you little wise head?” 
‘You first greeted him, and he thanked you. Tell me 
about that!” 
‘¢You witch! you are quite right; I didn’t begin at the 
beginning. Well, he asked me first of all whether I was still 
afraid of him. I made my best bow, and said: ‘ Forgive 
me, gracious Sir!’ Then he laughed, and had a jug of wine 
set before me.” 
“That is quite a different beginning! Ill warrant it did 
not take you long to dispose of the wine.” 
‘‘You are wrong, wife. I was bashful as a young bride, 
and would not touch it. But he bade me pour it out, and I 
drank his health, although he looked at me so steadily that 
the glass shook in my hand.” 
‘* Your conscience pricked you at the tips of your fingers, 
Leonard! But you recovered, I suppose?” 
‘Yes, very soon. He was very kind, and said: ‘It is 
quite natural for a hard-working man to like a glass of wine, 
and there is no objection to his having it; but itis a mis- 
fortune when a man makes a fool of himself over his wine, 
and forgets his family and the future.’ Wife, those words
-P-A-G-E-31
  
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 21 
seemed to stab me to the heart. He went on to say how 
unfortunate it was that poor people, when they are in 
trouble, usually get into the hands of the very persons they 
ought to avoid like the plague, and then have neither the 
sense nor the courage to tell their situation to those who 
would be glad to help them. ‘ Mason,’ he said, ‘ just think 
what would have been the upshot of your difficulties, if your 
wife had had no more courage and common sense than 
you!’” 
‘¢ And he said all this,” observed Gertrude, ‘‘ before ask- 
ing the number of the house? You didn’t mean to tell me 
of it, you scamp !” 
‘T think it might have been wiser if I had not, for you 
will be growing much too vain on account of your courage.” 
‘Do you think so, my good sir? Well, I do believe I 
shall pride myself all my life on this deed of mine. But 
what did Arner say next?” 
‘‘Oh, he examined me in regard to the building. I had to 
reckon up every single item of the expense, even to the 
bringing of lime and sand and stone.” 
‘¢T hope you made no mistakes.” 
“No, not this time, my love. And guess how much he 
has given me in advance” —jingling the coins in his pocket. 
‘¢Tt is a long time since we have heard the sound of so much 
silver.” Gertrude sighed. ‘‘ Don’t sigh, my love! We 
will be prudent and saving, and shall surely never be in such 
distress again.” 
‘¢ Yes, God in heaven has helped us,” she murmured. 
‘¢ And many more in the village beside. Only think, he 
has chosen ten fathers of families as laborers on the build- 
ing, and will give them each twenty-five kreutzers a day. 
He asked how many children they each had, and what was 
their trade, and then picked out those who were worst off, 
and had the most young children. He asked me if I knew
-P-A-G-E-32
22 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
anybody who was in trouble, as I had been, and I mentioned 
Hiibel-Rudy ; so he is sure of work for a year.” 
‘‘That was very right of you, not to let Rudy suffer for 
taking your potatoes.” 
‘¢T couldn’t bear a grudge against a poor man, wife, — 
and they are in a wretched condition. I found Rudy a few 
days ago near the potato-bin, and I pretended not to see 
him. He was the picture of want, and we have always had 
something to eat.” 
‘¢That is all very well, my dear husband. But stealing 
doesn’t help people out of their misery, and those who do it 
only become doubly wretched.” 
‘True; but when a man is suffering the pangs of hunger, 
and sees food before him; when he knows how much of it 
must rot in the bins, and that even the cattle have enough 
to eat, —O Gertrude! what strength of mind it takes to let 
it lie and not touch it!” 
‘It is hard indeed; yet the poor man must be able to do 
it, or he cannot help being miserable. But, Leonard, have 
you looked to see whether the men are at work? I didn’t 
tell you that Joseph stole away to the tavern again to-day.” 
‘‘How vexatious! The Bailiff must have sent for him. 
I stopped to speak to the men on my way home, and if he 
was fresh from the tavern, what he said makes me uneasy.” 
‘* What was it?” 
** He said the stone from the Schwendi quarry would be 
excellent for the church-wall; and when I told him that the 
great flint stones which lie about in great quantity were 
much better, he said I must always be a fool, and never 
know my own advantage. But this Schwendi stone is soft 
and sandy, and not at all fit for this work. If he has been 
with the Bailiff, there is something behind it all. Suppose it 
should be a trap!” 
‘* Beware of Joseph, he is not reliable,” warned Gertrude. 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 28 
‘‘ They won’t catch me so easily! Arner doesn’t want 
any sandstone in the foundation: he said it would decay 
and be corroded by saltpetre, because there are dung-heaps 
and stable drainage down by the wall. It is wonderful how 
perfectly he understands everything! While we were talk- 
ing, Lord Oberhofen was announced, and I thought I ought 
to say I would not detain him, but would come another day. 
Arner laughed, and said: ‘ No, mason, I like to finish what 
I am about, and wait till I have done with one person before 
attending to another. This is part of your old shiftless 
ways, to leave your work on the slightest provocation.’ I 
scratched my ear rather foolishly, wife, and wished I had 
held my tongue.” 
‘* He wasn’t so far out of the way,” said Gertrude with a 
laugh.
-P-A-G-E-34
  24 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
CHAPTER V. 
THE DEATH-BED OF A GOOD WOMAN. 
As soon as Leonard had left the Castle, Arner despatched 
a messenger to the Bailiff with the list of laborers, and 
orders to notify them of their employment. All previous 
letters from Arnheim had been directed : ‘‘ To the honorable 
and discreet, my dear and faithful Bailiff Hummel in 
Bonnal;” but the present communication bore the simple 
address: ‘‘ To the Bailiff Hummel in Bonnal.” ‘‘ What 
does that confounded secretary mean by not giving me my 
proper title?” growled the magistrate. 
“Take care, Bailiff!” cried Flink, the messenger. ‘‘It was 
our lord and master himself who directed the letter.” 
‘*Tmpossible! I know the writing of that powdered beg- 
gar of a secretary.” 
‘¢ That is going rather too far, Mr. Bailiff; for I stood by 
when Arner wrote the address, and saw him do it with my 
own eyes.” 
‘¢Then I have made an infernal blunder, Flink! Forget 
all about it, and come in and drink a glass of wine with me.” 
After the mollified messenger had taken his departure, the 
Bailiff ran his eye over the list, and muttered: ‘‘ They are 
all loafers and beggars, from beginning to end, — not a sin- 
gle one of them my men, except Michael. And I am to 
notify them all to-day! All right! I will advise them at 
the same time to go to the ‘Castle on Monday, and thank 
their benefactor. Arner doesn’t know one of the fellows, 
and when they come before him, all in tatters, one without
-P-A-G-E-35
  LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 25 
shoes, and another minus a hat, I am mistaken if I haven’t 
the best of the joke on my side.” 
He planned the order of his visits, and resolved to go first 
to Hiibel-Rudy, so as to have it over; for he had dreaded to 
approach the house ever since the lawsuit by which he had 
defrauded Rudy’s father of the meadow. Rudy was sitting 
with his children. It was but three months since his wife’s 
death, and now his mother lay dying on a bed of straw. 
“ Do get me some leaves for my coverlet this afternoon, — 
I am cold!” she said to her son. 
‘¢ Yes, mother; as soon as the fire is out, I will go.” 
‘‘Have you any more wood, Rudy? I fear not, for you 
cannot leave me and the children to go after any. O Rudy, 
I have lived to be a burden to you!” 
‘‘No, mother, do not say that! You are never a burden 
tome. If I could only give you what you need! You are 
hungry and thirsty and sick, and I, wretched man, can do 
nothing for you.” 
“Do not grieve, Rudy. God will soon relieve my suffer- 
ing, and as we draw near our end, we want little more on 
earth.” 
‘* But, mother,” he cried weeping, ‘‘ don’t you think you 
will get well again?” 
‘* No, Rudy, I am certain I shall not. But be comforted, 
my son! You have been the joy of my youth and the com- 
fort of my old age. I will pray to God for you, and all 
your sufferings will end in good.” 
‘¢ My dear, dear mother!” was all that he ‘could say. 
‘* Rudy,” she began presently, ‘‘I have just one thing on 
my mind before I die. Yesterday I saw our little Rudy hide 
behind my bed and eat roasted potatoes out of his pocket. 
He gave some to the other children, and they all eat them on 
the sly. Rudy, those potatoes cannot be our own, else he 
would have brought me some, as he used to do. How 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  26 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
pleased I always was when he came running to me with 
something in his hand, and cried in his affectionate way: 
‘You eat some, grandma!’ O Rudy, to think of this dar- 
ling child becoming a thief! Bring him to me.” 
As the boy approached her bed, she raised herself with 
an effort, and took both his hands in hers. The child 
sobbed aloud. ‘‘ What do you want, grandma? Don’t die, 
grandma!” 
‘‘Yes, my little Rudy, I must soon die,” she answered 
brokenly. The exertion had been too great, and she sank 
back upon the bed exhausted. 
“I will die with you, grandma!” cried the little fellow, 
weeping. 
““No, my Rudy; God grant you may live many years, 
and grow up to be a help and comfort to your father when 
he is old and weak. Promise me, my dear boy, that you 
will follow his example, and ErOW up a good man.” 
‘Yes, grandma, I promise.’ 
‘© And Rudy dear, the Father to whom I am now going 
sees everything we do, and hears all the promises we make. 
Do you know that?” 
‘Yes, grandma.” 
‘‘Then why did you eat stolen potatoes yesterday behind 
my bed?” 
“‘O grandma, do forgive me! I will never, never do so 
any more!” 
‘* From whom did you steal them?” 
*¢ From the mason,” sobbed the child. 
‘You must go to him, and ask his forgiveness; and in 
future, even if you are hungry, trust the dear God, and do 
not steal.” 
‘“‘No, grandma, I will never, never steal again, even if I 
am hungry.” 
‘‘Then may God bless and keep you, my dear boy!” she
-P-A-G-E-37
Py en SC aa 
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 27 
eried, pressing him to her heart. ‘‘ But now you must go to 
the mason. —~ Go with him, my son, and tell them I too 
implore their forgiveness, and only wish I could give back 
the potatoes. Say to them I will pray for a blessing on 
what they have left. It grieves me to the heart, they have 
so much need of all they have, and would not be able to 
make both ends meet, with their large family, if Gertrude 
did not work night and day. Rudy, I know you will work 
for him a couple of days, to make it up.” 
‘¢ With all my heart, my dear mother.” 
At this moment there was a tap on the window outside, 
and the sick woman recognized the Bailiff’s cough. ‘+ Mer- 
ciful heavens!” she exclaimed, ‘‘it is the Bailiff! I am 
afraid the bread and butter from which you are preparing 
my broth are not paid for.” 
“Do not worry, mother! I will work for him, and reap 
for him at harvest-time,” —and Rudy ran out of the room. 
The old woman sighed, and murmured: ‘‘ Since the law- 
suit (God forgive him!) the sight of him always stabs me to 
the heart. And to think that he must imbitter my last hour 
by standing under my window! It is God’s will that I 
should forgive him wholly, and pray for the welfare of his 
soul, and I will do it.” She heard the Bailiff talking in loud 
tones outside. ‘‘Good heavens, he is angry!” she cried; 
and as his voice again reached her ears, she fainted away. 
Little Rudy ran to the door, and called: ‘*Come, father, 
come! I think grandma is dead!” 
‘Merciful God!” exclaimed Rudy. ‘Bailiff, I must go 
in.” 
‘¢There is great need of that!” muttered Hummel; ‘it 
would be a terrible loss, indeed, if the old witch should be 
dead at last!” 
But Rudy did not hear his words, for he had rushed inte 
the house.’ The dying woman soon regained consciousness,
-P-A-G-E-38
  28 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
and inquired as she opened her eyes: ‘‘ Was he angry, 
Rudy? I am sure he would not wait, and has threatened you 
with the law.” 
‘* No, mother, it is good news; he gave me notice that I 
am to be one of the day-laborers at the building of the 
church, and we are each to have twenty-five kreutzers a day.” 
‘*Can that be really true? Then I shall die happier. 
Great God, thou art merciful!” Here her breath began to 
fail, and she took leave of her sorrowing son with courage 
and cheerfulness, invoking a blessing upon his head, and 
giving him a message of forgiveness for the Bailiff. Then 
she summoned the weeping children to her bedside, and 
spoke words of solace and counsel, leaving them her two 
Bibles and prayer-books as a remembrance. 
After the sick woman had ceased speaking, the children and 
their father remained for some time on their knees, praying, 
until Rudy finally arose and said: ‘‘ Mother, I will go now 
and get the leaves for your coverlet.” 
“There is no hurry about that,” she answered ; ‘‘ the room 
is warmer now, and you must go with the child to the 
mason’s.”” 
Gertrude was alone in the house when they came, and saw 
that both the boy and his father had tears in their eyes. 
‘*What is the matter, neighbor Rudy? Why are you both 
weeping ?”” — and she took the child kindly by the hand. 
«Alas, Gertrude, I am in trouble,” answered Htibel-Rudy. 
‘In his hunger, our little Rudy has taken potatoes from 
your bin several times. Forgive us, Gertrude! His grand- 
mother found it out yesterday, and he has confessed. She 
Jies on her death-bed, and has just taken leave of us; she 
adds her prayer for forgiveness to ours.” 
“Say no more, Rudy.—And you, my dear little fellow, 
come here and promise me never to take anything from any- 
body again. Come to me, if you are hungry, and if I can,
-P-A-G-E-39

LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 29 
| I will give you something.” She bent down and kissed him, 
adding: ‘‘ You have a dear, good grandmother ; try to grow 
up as pious and upright as she.” 
‘Please forgive me!” implored the boy; ‘‘I will never 
steal again.” 
‘¢ Thank God, I now have work at the church,” said his 
father, ‘‘ and I hope he will not be tempted by hunger to do 
such a thing again.” 
Gertrude only said: ‘‘ My husband and I were very glad 
that Arner chose you for one of the workmen.” 
‘¢ And I am so glad,” cried Rudy, ‘‘that my mother lived 
to know this consolation! Tell your husband I will work 
for him early and late, and would like to have the price of 
the potatoes deducted from my wages.”’ 
‘¢ Nonsense, Rudy! My husband will do no such thing. 
Heaven be praised, we are also better off on account of the 
building.” She filled the child’s pocket with dried fruit, 
and after helping his father gather leaves for the coverlet, 
accompanied him to his mother’s bedside. Her eyes filled 
with tears as she took the dying woman’s hand in hers. 
‘*You are weeping, Gertrude?” said Rudy’s mother. 
‘*Tt is we who should weep. Have you forgiven us?” 
‘* Speak no more of that, Catharine! I only wish I could 
do something for you in your sickness.” 
“You are very good, Gertrude; but God will soon help 
me. — My little Rudy, has she forgiven you?” 
‘“‘Yes, grandma; just see how good she is! ”” —display- 
ing the contents of his pocket. 
‘‘T am drowsy,” murmured the sick woman, ‘‘ and my 
eyes are growing dim. Gertrude, I wanted to ask something 
of you, but I hardly dare. This unhappy child has stolen 
from you; may I ask, Gertrude—when—I. am dead— 
these poor, motherless children — may I hope — that you” — 
Her eyes were already closed, and in a few moments she 
breathed her last. : 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  80 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
Gertrude tried to comfort poor Rudy, and repeated the 
last words of his mother, which he had not caught. He 
grasped her hand. ‘‘O Gertrude, how good my mother 
was! Tell me, you will remember her last wish?” 
“T should have a heart of stone if I could forget it. I 
will do what I can for your children.” Then she kissed little 
Rudy and the others, prepared the corpse for burial, and did 
not go home until everything was done which was necessary.

CHAPTER VI. 
REPENTANCE, HYPOCRISY, ROGUERY, AND FALSE PRIDE. 
Tue Bailiff continued his round of visits, meeting with 
various receptions from the different peasants to whose doors 
his errand carried him. In every instance he encountered 
astonishment, amounting often to incredulity, which in most 
cases gave place to joy and thankfulness as the poor men 
realized their good fortune. On his way to one of the 
houses, the Bailiff came unexpectedly upon Hans Wiist. 
“Is it you, Wiist?” he cried. ‘‘ Have you quite forgotten 
the money I lent you? ” 
‘¢T have no money now, and when I come to think of it, 
I am afraid I have paid too dearly for your money already.” 
‘Nonsense, Wiist! On my soul, I tell you that you only 
swore to what I read aloud to you a hundred times, — and 
you said each time: ‘Oh, yes, I can swear to that!’ But 
you only say this on account of the debt, so that I shall let 
you wait longer.” 
‘*No, Bailiff, you are wrong. If I had the money, I 
would fling it at your feet, so that I might never have to look 
you in the face again. I tried to see the matter as you did, 
although I was conscious all the time that our gracious mas- 
ter understood it differently.” 
‘What business was it of yours what he understood? 
You swore to nothing that was not true.’’ 
‘* No, Bailiff, it was a base deceit. Poor Rudy! Every- 
where I go, I see him before me, and his poor, sickly chil  
-P-A-G-E-42
  82 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
dren, who were once so healthy and blooming, before I swore 
that false oath which took his meadow from him.” 
“But you didn’t say it was not his, or that it was mine. 
What is it to you in the Devil’s name to whom the meadow 
belongs?” 
“Tt is nothing to me to whom the meadow belongs, but 
everything to me that I have sworn falsely, God forgive me!” 
“But I tell you, you didn’t swear falsely, Wiist! Now 
just drive it out of your head, and come in and drink a glass 
of wine with me, to cheer you up!” 
‘No, Bailiff. Nothing on earth can make me cheerful 
now.” 
‘‘Nonsense! See, here is your note, and I will tear it up 
before your eyes. I will take the responsibility of the matter 
on my own shoulders.” 
‘‘Take what responsibility you will! But day after to- 
morrow I shall sell my Sunday coat, and pay your debt.” 
“Don’t be such a fool, Wiist! But I must be going.” 
“Tt is a mercy! For if you staid any longer, I should 
go mad before your eyes.” 
They separated, and the Bailiff went on in no very com- 
fortable frame of mind to the house of Felix Kriecher. The 
latter was a man of sanctimonious appearance and deferen- 
tial manners, who attended all the sermons and church exer- 
cises, and courted favor especially with the pietists of the 
village, without, however, attaining to more than partial suc- 
cess in that quarter, since he was not willing to sacrifice his 
good standing among the remaining villagers for their sake. 
His private virtues, which were reserved strictly for the 
home circle, consisted in making the lives of his wife and 
children miserable. In their greatest poverty he always 
demanded something good to eat, and unless he obtained it, 
found fault with everything. If there was nothing else to 
criticise, and his little four-year-old happened to look at him
-P-A-G-E-43
  
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 38 
askance, he would strike the tiny hands with violence, ‘to 
teach it proper respect.” ‘‘ You are a fool!” said his wife 
on one of these occasions. He kicked her in return for this 
truthful statement, so that she stumbled and fell, receiving 
two severe wounds in her head. This alarmed the hypocrite 
for his own reputation, and he begged his wife, on his knees, 
to tell no one the circumstances. The poor woman complied, 
and told the neighbors she had had a fall; but Kriecher had 
forgotten the wound almost before it was healed. 
A quarter of an hour before the Bailiff’s visit, the cat had 
upset the oil lamp, which stood on the stove, and a few drops 
had been spilled. ‘Idiot! Why didn’t you train her better 
than that?” he cried in fury to his wife. ‘* Now you can 
sit in the dark, and light the fire with cow-dung, you horned 
beast!’ The woman was silent, but tears flowed down her 
cheeks, and the children were crying in the corners, when 
there came a knock at the door. ‘‘ Silence, for Heaven’s 
sake !” exclaimed Kriecher menacingly. He wiped the chil- 
dren’s tears with his handkerchief, threatening to cut any 
one of them to pieces that dared to whimper, and then opened 
the door to the Bailiff with a low bow. In a few words 
Hummel explained his errand. Kriecher listened, and as all 
seemed still within the room, he made answer: ‘‘ Come in, 
Sir Bailiff! I want to tell my dear wife at once what a piece 
of good fortune has befallen me.” 
They entered, and the hypocrite announced the joyful 
tidings. ‘‘Thank God!” said the poor woman, with an 
involuntary sigh. 
‘Ts anything the matter with your wife?” inquired the 
Bailiff. 
‘“T grieve to say she has not been quite well for some 
time past,” replied Kriecher, with an angry glance in the 
direction of his victim. ‘‘ But, Sir Bailiff, might I ask you 
to be so good as to thank our gracious master in my name 
for this favor?”
-P-A-G-E-44
  84 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
‘¢ You can do so yourself.” 
‘You are right, Sir Bailiff. It was a great liberty on my 
part to ask you to do it. I will go to the Castle within a 
day or two, —I feel it to be my duty.” 
‘Monday morning all the others are going, and you might 
go with them.” 
“Certainly I will. My best thanks to you, Sir Bailiff.” 
‘* You have no occasion to thank me,” replied the magis- 
trate, taking his departure. Soon after, he sought out the 
rogue Michael, a man after his own heart, who came to meet 
him with the salutation: ‘‘ What the Devil are you up to 
now?” 
“ Something jolly,” answered Hummel. 
‘You are the sort of fellow they would be likely to send 
out to invite people to weddings, dances, and jollifications 
generally!” 
‘¢ At all events my errand is no melancholy one.” 
‘Well, what is it?” 
‘You have got into new company.” 
‘* Who are they?” 
“« Hiibel-Rudy, Leuk, Leemann, Kriecher, Marx, and some 
others.” 
‘‘Nonsense! What am I to do in company with them?” 
‘¢ Build up and adorn the house of the Lord in Bonnal.” 
«In sober earnest?” 
** As I’m a living sinner.” 
‘‘But who has chosen the halt and the lame for such a 
purpose?” 
‘‘Our high-born, sagacious, and august master, Arner,” 
replied the Bailiff. 
“Ts he a fool?” 
‘¢How should I know?” 
‘ Tt looks like it.” 
“Perhaps it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world if
-P-A-G-E-45
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 35 
he were! But I must be going. Come to my house this 
evening, Michael; I want to have a talk with you.” 
The Bailiff next went to Marx, formerly a well-to-do mer- 
chant, whose property had long since come under the ham- 
mer, and who now lived wholly upon the charity of the parson 
and a few rich relations. In the depth of his poverty, how- 
ever, he retained his pride, and concealed his destitute con- 
dition most carefully from all except those who aided him. 
He started when he saw the Bailiff, and hustled the rags 
which lay about, under the bed-quilt, ordering the almost 
naked children to hide themselves in the adjoining room. 
“But, father!” they cried; ‘it. snows and rains in! 
Just hear what a storm it is, and there is no window in the 
room now.” 
‘*Go along, you wretched children, or you will drive me 
distracted! Do you think there is no need of your learning 
to mortify the flesh?” — and pushing them in, he fastened 
the door, and then invited the Bailiff into the room. 
On hearing the announcement, Marx inquired: ‘‘ Am I to 
be the overseer among these men?” 
‘“‘ What are you thinking of, Marx? You are workman, 
like all the rest, and are free to take or leave the job as you 
see fit.” 
‘¢T have not been accustomed to such work; but since it 
is under Arner and the pastor, I can’t very well decline.” 
‘They will be greatly rejoiced, and I am almost inclined 
to think Arner will send me back to thank you.” 
‘*T don’t mean exactly that; but generally speaking, | 
wouldn’t like to serve under everybody as day-laborer.” 
‘¢ Then you don’t lack for bread,” observed the Bailiff. 
“*T never have yet, thank God!” 
‘*So I supposed. But where are your children?” 
‘* With my sainted wife’s sister ; they dine at her house.” 
‘¢T thought I heard children crying in the next room.”
-P-A-G-E-46
  36 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
‘¢ There isn’t one of them at home.” 
But the Bailiff heard the same sound again, and, opening 
the door without ceremony, beheld the almost naked children, 
with chattering teeth, shivering in the wind, which drove the 
rain and snow into the half ruined apartment. ‘Is this 
where your children dine, Marx?” he asked. 
‘For Heaven’s sake, tell nobody of it, Bailiff! I should 
be the most miserable man under the sun, if it should become 
known!” 
‘Are you beside yourself, Marx? Why don’t you tell 
them to come out? Don’t you see they are blue with the 
cold? I wouldn’t treat my dog so!” 
‘“¢ Well, then, children, come out! But, Bailiff, for 
Heaven’s sake, tell nobody!” © 
*« And you play the saint before the pastor, you pious old 
infidel! It was you who told him about the row last week, 
—you, and no other! You were going home past my house 
at twelve o’clock, from some pious feast or other.” 
‘* No, as sure as I live, Bailiff, that is not true! May I 
never stir from this spot again if it is!” 
‘¢ Marx, will you maintain what you have just said before 
the parson’s face in my presence?” Marx stammered and 
grew confused. ‘‘Such a brute and a liar as you I never 
met before!” said the Bailiff; and before an hour had passed, 
he related the whole story to the pastor’s cook, who promised 
to report it to her master. The Bailiff rejoiced to think that 
the clergyman would now discontinue his weekly donation of 
bread; but he was greatly mistaken, for the pastor had hith- 
erto given the bread to Marx, not on account of his virtue, 
but of his hunger.

CHAPTER VII. 
HOW ROGUES DEAL WITH ONE ANOTHER. 
Ir was evening before the Bailiff had completed his list of 
visits, and when he reached home, he found his tables filled 
almost as full as usual with a swaggering, tippling, good-for- 
nothing crowd of peasants. ‘‘ Well, my good friends,” he 
cried, well pleased; ‘‘it is very handsome in you not to 
desert me! ” 
‘We haven’t had enough of you yet!” they shouted, 
drinking his health uproariously. The noise was so great 
that Hummel bade his wife close the shutters and put out the 
lights toward the street; then they transported everything 
into the back room, whence no sound could penetrate to the 
ears of the passer-by. 
When Michael appeared, the Bailiff took the vacant seat 
by his side, and clapping him on the shoulder, exclaimed : 
‘‘Do you belong among the sinners? Since your invitation 
to work on the church-wall, I thought you had suddenly 
grown as saintly as our butcher did, when he had to ring the 
bell for the sexton every noon for a week!” 
‘*No, Bailiff, I am not so suddenly converted; but if I 
once begin, I am not likely to stop.” 
**T would like to be your father confessor, Michael!” 
‘¢ But I wouldn’t like to have you!” 
“Why not?” 
‘¢ Because you would double my score with your holy chalk, 
while I should want a father confessor who would forgive and 
remit sins, not mark them down against me.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  38 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
“‘T can remit sins as well as any one, and have it often 
enough to do,” said the Bailiff, beckoning his companion to 
a little table which stood apart in the corner, and adding in 
a lower tone: ‘‘ It is lucky for you that you have come.” 
‘*T am in need of luck! ” Michael replied. 
“ Well, if you will take the trouble, you can make money 
enough in your new position.” 
“How?” 
“<You must get into the mason’s good graces, and appear 
very hungry and poor.” 
‘¢ That I can do without making believe.” 
“‘Then you must often give your supper to your children, 
so that people shall think your heart is as soft as melted but- 
ter; and your children must run after you barefoot and in 
rags.” 
‘¢That’s not so hard, either.” 
‘¢ And when you are the favorite out of all the ten, then 
your real work will begin, which is, to do everything in your 
power to bring the building into discredit, and make mischief 
between the workmen and the authorities.” 
“‘That will not be quite so easy,” observed the peasant’ 
dubiously. 
‘¢ But you will make money by it.” 
“Two thalers in advance, Sir Bailiff, if you please! 
Otherwise I refuse to enlist in this campaign.” 
After a vain attempt to resist this demand, the Bailiff 
yielded, whereupon Michael expressed his willingness to 
receive orders. 
“JT think some night you could easily break down the 
scaffolding, and smash in a couple of the church-windows at 
a single blow; of course ropes, and tools, and all such odds 
and ends, would disappear mysteriously.” 
‘¢Of course,” echoed Michael. 
*‘ And then on a dark night it would not be difficult tq
-P-A-G-E-49
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 3¢ 
earry all the planks down hill to the river, and start them on 
a journey to Holland.”’ 
‘‘ Nothing could be simpler! And I will hang a white 
shirt on a pole, in the middle of the churchyard, so that if 
the watchman and neighbors hear any noise, they may see a 
ghost, and keep out of the way.” 
‘* What an idea, Michael! But that is not all. If there 
are any of Arner’s drawings or plans lying about, you must 
carry them off where nobody would think of looking for 
them, and at night go and get them to light your fire with.” 
‘Very well, Sir.” 
‘¢Then you must try to bring it about that your honorable 
companions in service shall take life easy and dawdle over 
their work; and if Arner or any one comes from the Castle, 
the disorder must be at its height. I think you understand 
me now. But, Michael, the most important thing of all -is 
that you and I shall be enemies; so we will begin now. 
Somebody might report how we held counsel together in this 
corner.” 
“Very true, Sir.” 
‘Drink a couple of glasses, and then I will pretend to 
call you to account for some reckoning. You will contradict 
me, there will be high words between us, and we will put 
you out of doors.” 
This was soon accomplished without difficulty. 
‘¢ Bring us wine!” cried the men presently to their hostess. 
- Bailiff, we will drink on the strength of the coming harvest, 
—a sheaf out of the tithe for a measure of wine.” 
‘*You will pay me very soon!” observed their host ironi- 
cally. 
‘““Not so soon,” they answered, ‘‘but all the heavier 
weight.” 
Before long, all tongues were loosened by the wine, and 
there arose from every table a mixture of curses and oaths,
-P-A-G-E-50
  40 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
of swaggering abuse and wanton jest. Stories were told of 
theft and trickery, of lawsuits and riots, and of old Uli, who 
had paid the penalty of his roguery on the gallows. They 
were in the midst of this thrilling tale, when the Bailiff’s 
wife beckoned him to the door, and told him that Joseph 
wanted to see him. She had made the fellow take off his 
shoes and follow her noiselessly into a private room below, 
where he was soon joined by the Bailiff, who accosted 
him with: ‘‘ What do you want so late, Joseph?” 
“*Not much. I only wanted to tell you that it is all right 
about the stone.” 
‘Tam glad to hear it, Joseph.” 
‘¢My master was talking about the wall to-day, and said 
the flint-stone close by was very good. But I told him to 
his face that he was a fool, and that if the wall were made 
of Schwendi stone, it would be as smooth as a plate. He 
said nothing against it, so we shall open the quarry on 
Monday, after the workmen have returned from the Castle.” 
“That is famous! —if it were only done! Your reward 
is ready, Joseph.” 
‘*T am in great need of it at this very moment, Bailiff.” 
‘*Come for it Monday, after you have begun on the 
quarry.” 
“But I wanted to go after my new boots to-morrow, — 
give me three thalers now on our bargain!” 
‘*T can’t very well at present. Come Monday evening.” 
But Joseph was firm. It was plain, he said, how much 
confidence the Bailiff had in his word; and when once the 
quarry was opened, he felt sure that he, for his own part, 
could no longer rely on the Bailif’s promises. All Hummel’s 
assurances were in vain, and he finally bade his wife give 
Joseph three thalers. She took him aside, and earnestly 
besought him to reconsider. ‘* Don’t be so foolish!” she 
pleaded. ‘You have been drinking, and will repent to. 
morrow.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. ay 
He insisted, however, and as he placed the money in 
Joseph’s hand, he said once more: ‘‘ You will not deceive 
me?” 
‘¢Heaven forbid! What do you take me for?” was the 
reply. But as he reached the door, Joseph muttered to 
himself: ‘‘ Now I have my reward safer than it would have 
been in the Bailiff’s chest. He is an old rogue, and can’t 
make a fool of me. My master can take flint or blue stoue 
now, for aught I care !”
-P-A-G-E-52
42 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
CHAPTER VIII. 
A GOOD MOTHER’S SATURDAY EVENING. 
GerTRUDE, meanwhile, was at home alone with her chil- 
dren. Thoughtful and silent, she prepared the supper, and 
then took from the chest the Sunday clothes of all the 
family, so that on the morrow no petty cares might distract 
her thoughts from better things. When all was ready, she 
gathered the children about her, for it was her custom every 
Saturday to call their attention to their faults, and inculcate 
any lessons which the events of the week might bring home 
to their minds. To-day she was especially anxious to 
impress their young hearts with a sense of the goodness of 
God, as manifested during the past week; and when the 
little hands were all folded, Gertrude thus spoke: ‘‘ Children, 
I have something joyful to tell you. Your dear father has 
the promise of such good work that he will be able to 
earn much more than before, and we may hope in future 
to have less trouble and anxiety about getting our daily 
bread. Thank the dear God, my children, for being so good 
to us, and do not forget the time when every mouthful of 
bread had to be counted! Think always of those who suffer 
from hunger and want, as you did once, and if you have a 
trifle more than you really need, do not grudge giving it to 
them. Will you do this, children?” 
‘¢Oh, yes indeed, mother!” they all cried with one voice. 
Gertrude now asked the children whether they would not 
sometimes like to give away their afternoon bread to those 
poorer than themselves, and on meeting with an eager
-P-A-G-E-53
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 43 
response, she told each one to think of some hungry child 
who might be gladdened by the gift. Nicholas mentioned 
their neighbor, little Rudy ; Lizzie spoke of Marx’s daughter 
Betty ; and so with the others in turn. They were all so full 
of the idea that they resolved, with one accord, to carry out 
the plan on the following day. 
Then Gertrude spoke of Arner’s presents to the children, 
and promising to show them the money after their evening 
prayer, she began: ‘* Well, my dears, how has it been about 
doing right this week?” The children looked at each other, 
and were silent. ‘‘ Annie, have you been good this week?” 
Casting down her eyes in shame, the child replied: ‘‘ No, 
mother; you know how it was with my little brother ”— 
‘¢ Annie, something might have happened to the child, — 
and just think how you would like it, if you should be shut 
up in a room all alone without food or amusement! Little 
children who are left alone in that way sometimes scream so 
that they injure themselves for life. Why, Annie, I could 
never feel easy about going away from home, if I thought 
you would not take good care of the child.” 
‘* Indeed, mother, I will never leave him alone again!” 
** And, Nicholas,” said Gertrude, turning to her oldest 
son; ‘‘ how is it with you this week?” 
‘*T don’t remember anything wrong.” 
‘* Have you forgotten that you knocked down little Peggy 
on Monday?” 
‘¢T didn’t mean to, mother.” 
‘‘T should hope not, Nicholas! Aren’t you ashamed of 
talking so? If you grow up without considering the comfort 
of those about you, you will have to learn the lesson through 
bitter experience. Remember that, and be careful, my dear 
boy.— And Lizzie, how have you behaved this week?” 
‘‘T can’t think of anything out of the way this week, 
mother.” 
   
-P-A-G-E-54
  44 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
‘¢ Are you sure?” 
“T really can’t, mother, think as hard as I can; if I could, 
I would willingly tell you of it, mother.” 
‘* How you do manage to use as many words, even when 
you have nothing to say, as any one else who says a great 
deal!” 
‘‘What did I say now, mother?” 
‘Nothing at all, and yet a great deal. It is just what we 
have told you a thousand times, — you never think before- 
hand of what you are going to say, and yet must be always 
talking. What business was it of yours to tell the Bailiff, 
day before yesterday, that you knew Arner would come 
soon? Suppose your father had not wished him to know 
that he knew it, and your chattering had brought him into 
trouble?” 
‘¢T should be very sorry, mother. But neither of you said 
a word about its being a secret.” 
‘¢ Very well, I will tell your father when he comes home, 
that, whenever we are talking together, we must take care to 
add after each sentence: ‘ Lizzie may tell that to the neigh- 
bors, and talk about it at the well; but this she must not 
mention outside the house.’ So then you will know precisely 
what you may chatter about.” 
‘‘O mother, forgive me! That was not what I meant.” 
Gertrude talked similarly with all the other children about 
their faults, even saying to little Peggy: ‘‘ You mustn’t be 
so impatient for your soup, or I shall make you wait longer 
another time, and give it to one of the others.” 
After this was over, the children folded their hands and 
said their usual evening prayer, followed by a special prayer 
for Saturday night, which Gertrude had taught them. When 
the mother had uttered a final benediction, all sat quiet for a 
little while, until Lizzie broke the silence. ‘* Now will you 
show us the new money, mother?”
-P-A-G-E-55
  
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 45 
“Yes. But, Lizzie, you are always the first to speak!” 
Nicholas sprang from his seat, and in pressing forward to 
the light, gave little Peggy such a violent push that she cried 
aloud. 
‘* Nicholas!” said his mother, ‘“‘ that is not right. It is 
not a quarter of an hour since you promised to be more care- 
ful. You are not in earnest.” 
‘¢O mother, I never will do so again as long as I live! I 
am really in earnest, and very sorry.” 
‘*So am I, dear boy; but you will forget it all unless I 
punish you. You must go to bed without your supper.” 
She led the boy to his room, while the other children stood 
sadly by. ‘Do let him out again, just this once!” they 
entreated. 
‘¢ No, my dears ; he must be cured of his carelessness.” 
“Then we'll not look at our money till to-morrow, so that 
he can see it with us,” proposed Annie. 
“That is right, Annie!” — and after giving the children 
their supper, Gertrude went with then to the bedroom, where 
Nicholas was still crying. ‘‘ My dear, dear boy,” she said, 
‘* do be careful another time!” 
“Forgive me, dear mother!” he cried, throwing his arms 
about her neck. ‘‘ Only forgive me and kiss me, and I don’t 
mind losing my supper at all.” 
Gertrude kissed him, and a warm tear fell upon his face. 
She blessed the other children, and returned alone to the 
dimly lighted room. A solemn stillness filled her heart; she 
was penetrated with a consciousness of God’s goodness, and 
the happiness of those who place their trust in him. She 
was so deeply moved that she sank upon her knees and wept. 
Her eyes were still moist when her husband returned home. 
‘¢ Why are you weeping, Gertrude?” he inquired. 
** My dear husband, these are no tears of sorrow; I 
wanted to thank God for the blessings of this week, but my 
heart was so full that I could not speak for weeping.”  
-P-A-G-E-56
  46 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
Leonard leaned his head upon her breast, and his eyes 
were also filled with tears. Neither spoke for a short time ; 
but at last Gertrude asked if he did not wish any supper. 
‘©No,” he replied ; ‘‘ my heart is too full; I cannot eat.” 
‘Neither can I, dear. But I will tell you what we will 
do. We will carry our supper to poor Rudy, whose mother 
died to-day.” 
When they reached the house, Rudy was sitting weeping 
beside the corpse, and his little boy called from the adjoin- 
ing room, begging for bread, or raw roots, or anything 
to eat. ‘‘Alas! I have nothing,’’ answered the father. 
‘For Heaven’s sake, be quiet till morning!” 
“‘But I am so hungry, father!” moaned the child. “I 
am so hungry I cannot sleep.” 
Leonard and Gertrude heard the words, and opening the 
door, set down the food, and bade them eat quickly, before 
it was cold. Deeply affected, the mourner called to the boy: 
‘¢ Rudy, these are the people from whom you stole potatoes, 
—and alas! I too, have eaten some!” 
‘¢ Say no more about that,” said Gertrude, ‘‘ but eat.’” 
“Do let us eat, father!” begged the child. 
‘Well, then, say your grace.” 
The boy obeyed, then took up the spoon, trembled, wept 
and ate. They put aside a part of the food for the sleeping 
children, and the afflicted father attempted once more to 
thank his benefactors. As he did so, a sigh escaped him. 
“Ts anything the matter, Rudy? Is there anything we 
can do for you?” asked Leonard and Gertrude. 
‘No, nothing, thank you,” he replied, with difficulty 
repressing another deep sigh. 
The two looked at him compassionately. ‘* But you sigh; 
you certainly have some trouble at heart.” 
“Do tell them, father, they are so good!” besought little 
Rudy. 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
  
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 47 
‘¢May I?” said the poor man reluctantly. ‘I have 
neither shoes nor stockings, and to-morrow I must follow my 
mother to the grave, and the day after go to the Castle.” 
‘¢The idea of tormenting yourself so about that!” cried 
Leonard. ‘‘ Why didn’t you say so at first? . I shall be very 
glad to provide you with them.” 
‘¢ And can you believe,” said Rudy humbly, ‘‘ that, after 
all that has happened, I will return them to you uninjured 
and with thanks?” 
‘Hush, Rudy! I would trust you yet further than that. 
Your poverty and distress have made you too distrustful.” 
As Gertrude expressed a wish to look upon the dead, they 
all went with a feeble light to the bedside, and stood with 
tears in their eyes, gazing down upon the peaceful face. 
Then they covered up the lifeless form, and took leave of 
each other warmly, although without words.

CHAPTER IX. 
TWO SERMONS, AND THEIR RESULTS. 
Tue next morning, the pastor preached a stirring sermon 
against the ungodly, who grow rich by oppressing and 
cheating the poor, and whose consciences never give them a 
moment’s genuine peace. What right have such monsters 
of iniquity to present themselves before the table of the 
Lord? He closed with an exhortation to the poor and 
oppressed not to fear their powerful enemies, but to put 
their trust in the God of love, and to approach his holy 
meal with thanksgiving. The communion followed, in the 
distribution of which the Bailiff assisted, although at heart 
he was furious at the transparent allusions the clergyman’s 
discourse contained. Hummel went home and summoned 
his good-for-nothing comrades to the house, who joined him 
in abusing the sermon. But it happened that a church- 
warden, who lived in the same street with the Bailiff, and 
saw the men slink into the tavern between the services, set a 
reliable man to watch and see whether the fellows came out 
again before the afternoon meeting. As they did not, he 
went to the pastor, and informed him of his discovery. 
When the good man was reading to his congregation that 
afternoon the story of the Passion, he came to the words: 
“And when Judas had taken the sop, Satan entered into his 
heart ;” and he proceeded to discourse at length upon the 
history of the traitor. He declared that all those who went 
from the communion-table to gambling and drinking were 
not one whit better than Judas himself, and would come to 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 49 
the same end. He even grew so excited that he brought his 
fist down with violence upon the pulpit-rail, which he had 
not done for many years. The people at first were aston- 
ished, but soon began to suspect the cause of this unusual 
zeal; and before long, every eye was turned to the unfor- 
tunate wife of the Bailiff, who sat beside his empty seat. 
She dared not look any one in the face, and escaped from 
the church during the singing, followed by whispered jeers. 
She ran home as fast as she could, entered the room, flung 
her prayer-book angrily into the midst of the flasks and 
glasses, and began to sob aloud. 
‘“«What is the matter?” cried the Bailiff and the neighbors. 
‘‘That you ought to know without asking! It isn’t right 
for you to be tippling here on a Sunday!” 
‘Ts that all?” inquired the Bailiff. 
‘¢ This is the first time you ever cried about it,” sneered 
the peasants. 
“T thought at the very least you had lost your purse,” 
said her husband. ‘‘ Leave off blubbering and tell us what 
the matter is!” 
‘The pastor must have learned that these friends of 
yours were drinking here during the sermon.” 
‘cWhat Satan can have told him that?” exclaimed the 
Bailiff in dismay. 
‘‘ What Satan, you fool? They didn’t come down the 
chimney, did they?—but walked calmly along the street 
with their tobacco-pipes, past the churchwarden’s house. 
And now the parson has been talking in a way I cannot 
describe, and all the people pointed at me with their fingers. 
— But, neighbors, go as quickly as ever you can, out through 
the back door, before they have finished singing, so that, as 
they come home from church, they will find each one of you 
at his own door.” 
‘¢Yes, go!” ordered the Bailiff.  
-P-A-G-E-60
  50 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
When they were alone, his wife told him in detail of the 
pastor’s sermon, which so terrified him that for a time he 
was unable to speak. When he had somewhat recovered, 
he told her how furious he had been over the morning’s dis- 
course. ‘‘I could not pray at communion,” he said. ‘My 
heart was like a stone, and when the pastor gave me the 
bread, he looked at me in a way I shall never forget. A 
cold perspiration stood out on my forehead as I took the 
bread from him, and I trembled so at the altar that I could 
hardly hold the goblet. Joseph came up in his torn boots, 
and cast down his rascally eyes when he saw me, — how I 
shuddered at the thought of my three thalers! Next came 
Gertrude, raised her eyes toward heaven, and fixed them on 
the cup, as if she did not see me. She hates me, and seeks 
my ruin; yet she behaved as if I were not there. Then the 
mason approached, and looked at me as sorrowfully as if he 
wanted to ask my forgiveness from the bottom of his heart, 
whereas he would be glad to bring me to the gallows if he 
could. Finally Michael came, as pale and terrified as I 
myself. Iwas afraid Hans Wust would be the next, and if 
he had come, I should certainly have sunk to the ground. 
As it was, when I went back to my seat, I trembled so from 
head to foot that I could not hold the singing-book. And 
all the time I kept thinking: ‘Arner is to blame for every 
thing.’ And in my anger and rage something came into my 
head which I hardly dare tell you, —I thought of digging 
up the great boundary stone on the mountain, and rolling it 
down the precipice; nobody knows of this stone except 
myself, and if it were removed, Arner would lose a third 
part of his forest territory, for the government boundary 
would cut away the piece of land in a straight line from the 
rest of his property.” 
Terrified by her hvsband’s words, the Bailiff’s wife ear- 
nestly exhorted him to give up all intercourse with his
-P-A-G-E-61
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. §1 
evil companions, who would be the ruin of him, she said, 
before long. He made no reply, but walked out absently 
into the garden, and made a restless tour of his premises, 
ever accompanied by the strange thought which possessed 
his mind. The upshot of his reflections was that he dared 
not remove the boundary ; for the task must be performed at 
night, when he had not courage to go up into the dark wood 
alone, for fear of ghosts and hobgoblins. Yet he could 
not banish the idea, and to deliver himself from his own 
thoughts, he ran out into the street, and engaged in conver- 
sation with the first neighbor he met. Later he found a 
couple of thirsty wretches, whom he brought into the house ; 
and by treating them to liquor, he induced them to bear him 
company for the remainder of this dreadful day.

CHAPTER X. 
SUNDAY JOYS AND CHILDISH CHARACTER. 
Meranwaite, the Sunday had been very differently spent 
in the humble dwelling of the mason. While Leonard and 
Gertrude were at church, the children prayed, sang, and 
reviewed what they had learned during the week, so as to be 
ready to repeat it to their mother in the evening. Lizzie, the 
oldest, had the care of baby Peggy during Gertrude’s ab- 
sence, and it was her greatest delight to dress, feed, and tend 
the little one. It was pretty to see her motherly airs as she 
dandled and kissed and played with her charge. How 
pleased she was when the baby laughed back at her with 
outstretched arms, and kicked with its tiny feet! Then it 
would grasp Lizzie’s cap, or her pig-tails, or her nose, and 
crow over her bright Sunday neckerchief, until Nicholas and 
Annie would come up behind and crow in imitation; then 
the little one would turn at the sound, and laugh at the 
merry Nicholas, who would spring forward to kiss his baby 
sister. This would arouse Lizzie’s jealousy, and she would 
exert herself to the utmost to make the little darling laugh at 
her. She devoted herself to the amusement of her charge, 
lifting the child in her arms almost to the ceiling, and then 
letting it down carefully to the very ground, until it screamed 
aloud with delight. Then she would hold it close to the 
looking-glass, so that it laughed at the baby within; but the 
most joyful moment of all was when the little one espied its 
mother far down the street, crowed, stretched out its tiny 
hands, and nearly sprang out of Lizzie’s arms.
-P-A-G-E-63
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE, 53 
Gertrude was satisfied with her children to-day, for they 
had done everything as she had told them. They now had 
their reward in a frolic with their parents, for climbing joy- 
fully into the laps of father and mother, the children pos- 
sessed themselves of their hands, and clasped their necks 
tightly with small arms. Ever since Gertrude had been a 
mother, this was her Sunday delight ; but to-day Leonard’s 
eyes filled with tears at the thought that he had often de- 
prived himself of these home joys. The happy parents 
talked with the children of their Father in heaven, and the 
sufferings of their Saviour, while the little ones listened atten- 
tively. The noon hour passed as swiftly and happily as a 
wedding feast, and the peal of bells again summoned Leon- 
ard and Gertrude to church. 
When they returned home in the afternoon, the children 
ran down the steps to meet them, crying: ‘‘ Oh, do hurry, 
mother! We want to repeat what we have learned this 
week, and get through as soon as possible.” 
‘¢ Why are you in such desperate haste, my dears?” asked 
Gertrude smiling. 
‘‘ Why, when we are through, mother, you know what 
you promised us yesterday about the bread. We may, 
mother, mayn’t we?” 
“First I will see how well you know what you have 
learned,” was the reply. 
The lesson was soon satisfactorily concluded, whereupon 
Gertrude brought out the bread, and two dishes of milk 
from which she had not removed the cream, because it was 
a holiday. Not one of the children touched the bread, but 
each rejoiced over his or her piece, maintaining that it was 
the largest. When the milk had disappeared, Nicholas crept 
up to his mother’s side, and taking her hand, whispered : 
** You will give me just one mouthful of bread for myself, 
will you not, mother?”
-P-A-G-E-64
  
54 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
‘¢ You have your piece, Nicholas.” 
“ But I must give it to Rudy.” 
“T haven’t told you to give it to him,” said his mother. 
‘You can eat it if you like.” 
“T don’t want to eat it; but you will give me just one 
mouthful? ” 
‘* Certainly not, my boy.” 
‘¢Why not?” 
‘¢ So that you needn’t imagine we are only to think of the 
poor after our own hunger is satisfied. And now will you 
give him the whole of it?” 
‘Yes, mother, every bit. I know he is frightfully hungry, 
and we have supper at six.” 
‘© Yes, Nicholas, and I hardly think he will have anything 
fo eat then.” 
The mother now turned to the other children, and asked if 
they, too, had quite decided to give their bread away, re- 
ceiving in each case an affirmative answer. ‘‘ That is right, 
children,” she said. ‘‘ But now, how will you set about it? 
- — Nicholas, how are you going to manage with your bread?” 
“Tl run as fast as I can, and call Rudy. I shall not put 
it in my pocket, so that he may have it all the quicker. Let 
me go, mother!” 
‘¢Stop a minute, Nicholas !— Lizzie, what are you going 
to do?” 
“I am not going to do like Nicholas. I shall call Betty 
into a corner, and hide the bread under my apron, so that 
nobody will see it, not even her fathe~ ” 
“© And Annie?” 
‘*T can’t tell where I shall find Ha:ry —I shall give it to 
him just as it happens.” 
‘¢ And Jonas, you little rogue, you have some mischief in 
your head ; how are you planning to do it?” 
‘*T shall stick my bread into his mouth, mother, as you de
-P-A-G-E-65
  
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 55 
to me in fun. ‘Open your mouth and shut your eyes,’ I 
shall say, and then put it between his teeth. Don’t you 
think he’ll laugh?” 
‘«That is all very well, children,” said Gertrude. ‘‘ But 
I must tell you one thing: you must give away the bread 
quietly, so no one may see, that people needn’t think you 
want to show off your generosity.” 
“Whew! mother,” cried Nicholas ; ‘‘ then I must put my, 
bread in my pocket?” 
‘*Of course, Nicholas.” 
‘“< That is just what occurred to me, mother,” said Lizzie. 
‘¢ You know I said just now that I wouldn’t do like him.” 
‘“*You are always the wisest, Lizzie. I forgot to praise 
you for it, and you do well to remind me of it yourself.” 
Lizzie colored, and was silent. 
The children departed on their several missions. Nicholas 
ran at full speed to Rudy’s cottage, but no one was in sight. 
After calling several times without any reply, he went into 
the house. Little Rudy was sitting with his father and the 
other children, weeping beside the coffin of his grandmother, 
when Nicholas opened the door of the room, and started 
back at sight of the dead. The father saw him, and think- 
ing there might be some message from Leonard, ran after 
the boy, and asked what he wanted. ‘‘ Nothing,” answered 
Nicholas ; ‘‘I only wanted to see Rudy, but he is praying 
now.” 
‘*Come in, if you want to see him.” 
“T can’t. Please let him come out to me a minute!” 
The father beckoned to his son, but little Rudy called out 
to his friend: ‘‘I don’t want to come into the street now, 
Nicholas! I would rather stay with my grandmother, — 
they will take her away from me soon.” 
*« Just come a minute!” pleaded the visitor. 
He came out; and Nicholas, taking him by the arm, whis- ” 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  56 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
pered mysteriously: ‘‘Come, I have something to say to 
you!” and leading him into a retired corner, he transferred 
the bread from his own pocket to Rudy’s, and ran away as 
quickly as he had come. 
Lizzie, meanwhile, had advanced with measured pace to 
the upper village, where Marx’s daughter Betty lived. The 
latter was standing at the window, and slipped quietly out 
of the room in response to a signal from her friend. Not so 
quietly, however, but that her father noticed it, and creeping 
after her, concealed himself behind the door. 
‘* Here, Betty, I have some bread for you,” began Lizzie. 
The girl stretched out a trembling hand for the offered 
food, as she answered: ‘‘ How good you are, Lizzie! Iam 
very hungry. But why should you bring me bread now?” 
‘* Because I am fond of you, Betty. We have enough 
bread now ; my father is to build the church.” 
‘¢So is mine.” 
** Yes, but yours is only a day-laborer.” 
‘¢That is all the same, if we only get bread by it.” 
‘* Have you had to suffer much from hunger, Betty?” 
‘¢ Oh, I only hope the worst is over!” 
‘¢ What did you have for dinner to-day?” inquired her 
guest. 
‘¢ That I mustn’t tell you.” 
‘¢ Why not?” 
‘Tf my father should know I told you, he would ”— 
‘¢ T should be likely to go straight and tell him!” observed 
Lizzie in an injured tone. Betty drew from her pocket a 
piece of raw turnip. 
‘¢Goodness!” ejaculated her visitor; ‘‘ nothing but 
that?” 
‘* No, not for the last two days.” 
‘* And you mustn’t tell anybody, or ask for anything from 
any one?”
-P-A-G-E-67
  LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 57 
‘No, indeed! If he knew what I have told you, I should 
have a hard time of it.” 
‘¢ Eat your bread before you have to go in,” advised her 
friend prudently. 
Betty was not slow to follow this counsel, but had no 
sooner taken a bite than the pious Marx opened the door, 
and said: ‘‘ What are you eating, my child?” 
The unfortunate girl gulped down the unchewed mouthful, 
and answered: ‘‘ Nothing, father.” 
“Nothing? Just you wait!— And, Lizzie, it is no favor 
to me to give my children bread behind my back, so 
that they shall tell such outrageous lies about what we eat 
and drink in the house. —You wretched Betty! Didn’t we 
have an omelette for dinner?” 
Lizzie, at this juncture, hastened away as rapidly as she 
had come deliberately, while the affectionate father seized 
his daughter by the arm, and dragged her into the house, 
whence Lizzie heard cries issuing long after she had left it 
far behind. 
Annie found Harry at his door, and gave him her piece of 
bread without further adventures. 
Little Jonas crept around Michael’s house, until Bobby 
saw him, and came out. ‘‘‘ What are you after, Jonas?” 
he cried. 
*«T want to have some fun.” 
“¢ All right, come on!” 
‘¢ Will you do just as I say, Bobby? If you will, we shall 
have lots of fun.” 
‘¢ Well, then, what shall we do?” 
‘¢-You must open your mouth and shut your eyes.” 
‘Yes, and then you'll put something dirty in my mouth.” 
‘* No, Bobby, I won’t, —on my honor!” 
‘s Well, then. But look out and don’t cheat me!” — 
opening his mouth and half shutting his eyes.

58 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
«« Shut your eyes tight, or it’s no fair!” 
The little fellow obeyed, and Jonas quickly put the bread 
between his teeth, and ran away. 
‘‘ This is fun!” said Bobby, sitting down on the door-step 
to enjoy the feast. 
His father Michael had observed the children’s play from 
the window, and recognized Leonard’s little Jonas. His 
heart smote him as he thought of the treacherous part he 
had been about to play towards the mason; and he resolved 
upon the spot to have nothing more to do with the evil 
designs of the Bailiff.  
-P-A-G-E-69
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 59 
CHAPTER XI. 
THE BAILIFF GROWS STILL MORE ANGRY. 
Lronarp was awakened the next morning by a voice out- 
side his window. It was Flink, the armed servant from the 
Castle, with orders that the mason should have the men 
begin to break the stones that morning. Leonard remem- 
bered he had heard something about the workmen going to 
the Castle to thank Arner, but hoped it was early enough to 
anticipate this manceuvre. To his annoyance, however, he 
found that the men had started half an hour ago. Flink 
hastened to a high hill, commanding the road; but although 
he shouted until he was hoarse, it was of no avail, and the 
dimly discernible figures had soon vanished in the distance. 
The Bailiff, however, who had started later than the others, 
heard the cries, and turned back to ascertain their cause. 
Great was his vexation when Flink informed him that in 
consequence of a severe headache the night before, he had 
delayed the delivery of his message until morning. ‘* You 
cursed scoundrel! what kind of a trick do you call that?” 
thundered the Bailiff. 
‘“‘Tt may not be so bad, after all,” returned the man. 
‘¢ How the Devil was I to know that the fellows would all 
go capering out of the village before daybreak? Was it by 
your orders?” 
‘¢ Yes, you dog, it was. And now I suppose I shall have 
to pay for your fault!” 
‘¢T shall not have any too easy a time of it myself,” said 
Flink ruefully. 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
    60 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
The Bailiff advised the unlucky messenger to throw him. 
self on Leonard’s mercy, and beg the mason to tell Arner he 
had received the message on Sunday, but that as it was 
a holiday, he had put off telling the men until the morrow. 
Flink acted on this suggestion, and the good-natured mason 
made no objection. When he consulted his wife, however, 
Gertrude said: ‘‘I am afraid of everything which is not 
straightforward. If Arner asks you about it, you must tell 
him the truth; but if, as is probable, no one inquires about 
the matter, you can let it rest as they wish, since it will 
injure nobody.” And thus it was settled. 
Meanwhile, the workmen reached the Castle, and were at 
once admitted to the presence of Arner, who asked them 
kindly what they wanted. When they had managed to stam- 
mer their thanks, Arner inquired at whose bidding they had 
come, and on learning the truth, dismissed them, saying: 
‘¢ This has occurred contrary to my wishes. But go now, in 
God’s name, and if you are faithful and industrious, I shall 
be glad.if the work benefits any of you. Tell your master 
to begin breaking the stones to-day.” 
On their way back, the men talked of the kindness of 
Arner, which they could not but contrast unfavorably with 
the Bailiff’s treatment. ‘‘ What a mean trick it was, to lead 
us such a dance without orders, and then leave us in the 
lurch!” cried one. 
‘¢ That is his way,” remarked another. 
‘‘Tt?s a mean way, then,” responded Leuk, the man who 
had first spoken. 
“Yes, but the Bailiff is a worthy man, and the like of us 
can’t always see all sides of the question !” said Kriecher as 
loud as he could, —for he saw the Bailiff stealthily advan- 
cing toward them in the hollow. 
‘¢ The Devil! You can praise him, if you like, but J shall 
praise Arner!” shouted Leuk, who did not observe Hummel’s 
approach. 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
  
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 61 
The Bailiff now appeared from the neighboring hedge, and 
after greeting his neighbors, asked Leuk why he was sound- 
ing Arner’s praises so loudly. 
‘We were only saying how good-natured and kind he 
was,” answered the man in some confusion. 
‘¢ But that was not all,” said the Bailiff. 
‘* All that I know of,” returned Leuk doggedly. 
‘¢ Tt isn’t very nice in a man to deny his words in that way, 
Leuk,” remarked Kriecher. ‘‘ And he was not the only one, 
Sir Bailiff. Several of them were complaining that you had 
left them in the lurch, but I told them that such as we couldn’t 
expect to know your Honor’s reasons. Then Leuk told me 
I might praise the Bailiff, but he would praise Arner.” 
The men here began to shake their heads, and murmur 
against Kriecher, so that the Bailiff, pressing the hand of his 
hypocritical ally, made haste to change the subject, and 
asked whether Arner had been angry. ‘‘ Not at all,” re- 
plied the men; ‘‘he only told us to hurry home and begin 
our work without delay.” 
“Tell the mason so, and that the misunderstanding is of 
no consequence,”’ said Hummel, as he left them and con- 
tinued on his way. 
When the Bailiff reached the Castle, Arner kept him wait- 
ing for some time ; and when the nobleman finally appeared, 
he asked Hummel in some displeasure why he had taken it 
upon himself to counsel the masons to come to the Castle 
that morning. 
‘¢T thought it my duty,” replied the Bailiff, ‘‘ to advise the 
men to thank your Grace for the work.” 
‘* Your duty is to do what is useful to me and my people, 
and what I bid you; but not to send poor men on a wild- 
goose chase, and teach them to make fine speeches, which are 
as useless as they are undesired. —But I sent for you in 
order to tell you that I will no longer suffer the offices of 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  62 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
bailiff and tavern-keeper to be united in the same person. I 
will give you your choice between the two, and desire ta 
know your decision a fortnight from to-day.” 
The Bailiff was so thunderstruck by the suddenness of the 
announcement, that he was hardly able to stammer his hum- 
ble thanks for the two weeks’ respite, and left his chief soon 
after in a transport of anger and despair. He stopped under 
the old nut-tree by the road, to take breath and collect his 
scattered senses. He was so weak that he could hardly 
think, and taking his brandy-bottle from his pocket, he 
gulped down a half pint at one draught. It revived his 
strength immediately, and all his old pride returned, so that 
he responded to the greetings of the passers-by with 4 
haughty nod, and carried his knotted stick with a command- 
ing air, as if his power were greater in the land than that of 
ten Arners. 
On his way home, the Bailiff stopped at the tavern in 
Hirzau, and drank and boasted among the assembled peas- 
ants. The old forester from the Castle stopped, in passing, 
for a glass, and Hummel, who dreaded being alone, proposed 
that they should walk back to the village together. On the 
way he inquired of his companion whether there were ghosts 
in the forest at night. ‘‘ Why do you ask me that?” queried 
the forester. 
‘¢ Because I want to know.” 
‘You are an old fool! The idea of being Bailiff thirty 
years, and then asking such absurd questions !— But I’ll help 
you out of your uncertainty, if you'll pay me with a bottle of 
wine.” 
“« Two, if you can succeed in convincing me! ” 
‘* Well, I have been forester forty years, and ever since I 
was four years old, I was brought up in the woods by my 
father. As it would not do for a forester to believe in ghosts 
or hobgoblins, he used to take me into the forest on dark
-P-A-G-E-73
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 63 
nights, and then whenever he saw a light or heard a noise, 
we hurried after it, over stumps and ditches, through swamps 
and bushes. It always turned out to be tramps or thieves, 
who took to their heels when he shouted: ‘ Away, rogues!’ 
And sometimes the wild beasts make queer noises, and the 
rotten tree-trunks give out light. That is all I have ever 
found in the forest ; but it is greatly tomy advantage for my 
neighbors to believe in ghosts, so that I need not turn out on 
dark nights after the rascals.” 
Here the forester entered a by-path which led into the 
wood, while the Bailiff went on, busied with his own reflec- 
tions, until he reached the confines of the village, where he 
beheld the masons at work on the great stones which lay 
about on the plain. ‘‘I cannot go by that accursed Joseph 
in silence !” he exclaimed to himself. He sat down upon the 
hillside, on which the last rays of the setting sun were falling, 
and waited until the village bell rang out six o’clock ; then the 
masons started on their homeward way, and the Bailiff fol- 
lowed them.

CHAPTER XII. 
RATS DESERT A SINKING SHIP, AND THE DEVIL APPEARS TO 
THE INHABITANTS OF BONNAL. 
Arter Hans Wiist had parted from the Bailiff on Saturday 
night, he was so overcome with remorse for his perjury that 
he was almost beside himself. He rolled on the floor, tore 
his hair, and struck himself violently with his fists. The fol- 
lowing day he could neither eat nor drink, but wandered 
about, groaning in agony of spirit, until at night, exhausted 
by his anguish, he at last fell asleep. He awoke with the 
resolution not to bear his distress longer alone, and making 
a bundle of his Sunday coat and whatever else he could find, 
he went to the pastor’s house. The good man noticed the 
wild looks of his approaching guest, and going to meet him, 
asked what was the matter, inviting him so kindly into his 
room, that poor Wtist was reiissured, and made a clean 
breast of the whole matter. The pastor assured him of for- 
giveness from above, and persuaded him that the only right 
and wise course was to confess all to Arner. The poor 
wretch was melted to tears by the parson’s comforting words, 
and finally took courage to make a request. He told his 
counsellor of the eight florins which he owed the Bailiff, and 
tendered his bundle of belongings as security for the advance- 
ment of the money. The good pastor immediately offered him 
the sum as a loan, insisting that the Sunday coat should be 
carried home again. Once more light at heart, Wiist hastened 
to the Bailiff’s house, and as the latter was not at home, gave
-P-A-G-E-75
  LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 65 
the money to his wife, who received and counted it in no 
small wonder and perturbation of spirit. 
Before night, another of the Bailiff’s tools had deserted 
him. On this, the first day the workmen were together, 
Leonard won the hearts of all the men by his patience with 
their stupidity, and his good-natured zeal in undertaking the 
hardest and most disagreeable parts of the labor himself. 
Michael, while working by the master’s side the whole after- 
noon, strengthened himself in the resolution he had made 
the evening before, and at night proposed to accompany 
Leonard home, saying that he had something to tell him. 
Arrived at the mason’s cottage, he related the rogue’s busi- 
ness in which the Bailiff had sought to enlist him, and con- 
fessed that he had already received two thalers in advance 
on the bargain. Leonard and Gertrude were overcome with 
horror. He exhorted them to make their minds easy on his 
account, and proposed to lay a trap for the Bailiff, by pre- 
tending to be true to his agreement, and on the next day 
transferring some of the tools to the Bailiff’s house, which 
should then be searched by a warrant from Arner. But the 
mason and his wife would not consent to this. ‘‘ We ought 
to thank God,” said Gertrude, ‘‘ that we are delivered from 
the danger which threatened us; but it is not for us to take 
vengeance on our enemies.” Michael owned that she was 
right, but confessed that he had already spent a half thaler 
of his bribe, so that it would be impossible for him to restore 
the whole amount at present. Leonard gladly advanced the 
money out of Michael’s future wages, and the latter left his 
new friends, bent on freeing himself at once from all obliga- 
tion to Hummel. 
When the Bailiff reached home, he found his wife afone, 
so that he could give vent at last to the accumulated rage of 
the day. The terrified woman tried in vain to check his 
violence. ‘‘ Haven’t I reason to be angry?” he burst forth.
-P-A-G-E-76
  66 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
*‘ Arner is going to take away either my license or my 
Bailiff’s mantle in a fortnight.” 
‘<7 know it,” she said; ‘‘ although I did not learn it until 
this evening. The whole village knows it by this time. 
And something else has happened, —Hans Wiist has brought 
back the eight florins.” 
Thunderstruck at these words, the Bailiff gazed stupidly 
at his wife without speaking. Finally he asked her for the 
money, and she brought it in a broken beer-glass. He 
looked at it without counting it, and observed: ‘‘ This 
doesn’t come from the Castle, for Arner never gives such 
coin as this. If I had been here, I would have found out 
where it came from. — Bring me wine, wife!” 
She placed the tankard before him, and pacing the room, 
he muttered between the draughts: ‘‘I must ruin the mason 
first of all. Michael must ruin him, if it costs me a hundred 
thalers !” 
At this moment there was a knock at the door. ‘‘ Who 
comes so late?” he cried with a start. 
‘*Open the door, Bailiff!” called Michael’s voice from 
without. 
Hummel hastened to bid his visitor welcome. ‘‘ What 
good news do you bring, Michael?” 
‘¢Not much. I only wanted to tell you”? — 
“‘ Don’t stand there in the street! Come in!” 
“No, Bailiff, I must go home. I only wanted to say that 
I have repented of our bargain.” 
“«Repented? Nonsense! No, Michael, that must not be. 
If two thalers are not enough, I’ll give you more. Only 
come in!” 
“No, Bailiff, on no account. There are your two 
thalers.” 
‘*T swear I will not take them from you! Don’t be such 
a fool, but come in!”
-P-A-G-E-77
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 67 
Michael was forced to follow him, but as soon as he had 
entered the room, he laid the money on the table, and has- 
tened away. 
The Bailiff stood awhile speechless ; his eyes rolled wildly, 
and he foamed at the mouth. At length he burst out: 
“« Wife, bring me brandy! It must be,— Iam going!” 
‘¢Oh, where are you going this pitch-dark night?” she 
cried in terror. 
‘“‘T am going to dig up the stone, —give me the bottle!’’ 
—and deaf to all entreaties, he seized pickaxe, shovel and 
mattock, and hastened up the mountain in the darkness. 
Although emboldened by rage and brandy, yet whenever he 
saw a bit of incandescent wood, or heard the rustling of a 
hare near his path, he halted trembling for a moment, and 
then rushed madly on again; until at length he reached the 
solitary mile-stone, where he at once set vigorously to work. 
Ere long, he was startled by a noise, and looking up, saw a 
black figure emerge from the bushes and come toward him. 
Light shone around the apparition, and fire burned upon its 
head. ‘It is the Devil incarnate!” gasped the Bailiff, and 
with horrible cries he took to his heels, leaving tools, hat 
and brandy-bottle behind him. As he ran blindly on, a 
most unearthly sound of rattling and clanking continually 
pursued him, and he heard ever and anon a hollow voice, 
which seemed to curdle the blood in his veins, crying behind 
him: ‘Oh! Ah! Uh! Hummel! Wait, Bailiff, you are 
mine!” 
The Bailiff rushed on toward the village, shouting at the 
top of his lungs: ‘‘ Murder! Help! Watchman! The Devil 
is after me!” The watchman heard the cries and commo- 
tion, and was so terrified that he tapped on the neighbors’ 
windows to summon them to his aid. When ten or a dozen 
were assembled, they proposed to sally forth with torches 
and fire-arms, in the direction of the noise, taking new
-P-A-G-E-78
68 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
bread, a Testament and a Psalter in their pockets, to coun- 
teract the power of the Devil. The men stopped first at the 
Bailiff’s house, to be certain that he was actually away from 
home, and were joined by his wife, who was almost beside 
herself with anxiety. 
As they approached the scene of the hubbub, the hollow 
voice and the clanking suddenly ceased. Kunz, who hap- 
pened to be the foremost of the band, now came up and 
seized the howling Bailiff roughly by the arm. ‘O Devil, 
spare me!” screamed poor Hummel, still too much terrified 
to use his eyes or ears. The rest of the men hung back, and 
looked cautiously about with their torches, to see if any sign 
of the Devil remained ; but Kunz boldly declared it to be his 
opinion that a poacher or a woodman had made game of them 
all, since at his approach he had heard a man run up hill. 
“ And what is to prevent the Devil from running so as to be 
heard?” asked the men, while all agreed that it was no 
human voice which had so alarmed them, and that a whole 
wagon-load of iron could not make as fearful a rattling as 
the sound which had reached their ears. 
The Bailiff heard none of the conversation, but when he 
reached home, he begged the neighbors not to leave him, and 
they willingly consented to remain in the tavern.
-P-A-G-E-79
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 69 
CHAPTER XIII. 
THE CULPRIT CONFESSES AND RECEIVES HIS SENTENCE. 
In the mean time, the alarm had spread through the vil- 
lage, and the pastor, among others, received accounts of the 
awful catastrophe. Thinking he might turn the Bailiff’s 
fright to good account, he betook himself to the tavern, and 
besought the neighbors, who rose and saluted him respect- 
fully at his entrance, to leave him alone with Hummel for a 
while. As they departed, the good man cautioned them not 
to be in too great haste to talk about the affair, since at 
present it was impossible for any one to judge precisely what 
had really happened. But the men only grumbled outside 
the door: ‘‘He is always an old fool, and doesn’t believe 
anything ! ” 
When the pastor found himself alone with the Bailiff, he 
questioned him kindly about his strange adventure. ‘‘I am 
a poor unlucky wretch,” was the reply, ‘‘and Satan himself 
tried to catch me.” 
‘* Did you actually see anybody?” inquired the clergyman. 
‘* Yes, I saw him running toward me. He was a great 
black man with fire on his head, and he followed me to the 
foot of the mountain.” 
‘* Well, Bailiff, we will let the matter rest there, as it is 
impossible to explain it. And it is of no great consequence, 
after all, when you consider that there is an eternity, in 
which the unrighteous will surely fall into his clutches. It 
is this danger which, considering your age and your way of 
life, ought to cause you anxiety.”
-P-A-G-E-80
70 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
The poor Bailiff was wrought up to such a pitch of terror 
that he besought the pastor piteously to tell him how he 
might escape the Devil’s power, and regain the grace of 
God. The good man counselled him to repentance, and 
restitution of his unlawfully acquired property. Hummel 
was so thoroughly cowed that he promised to restore Rudy’s 
meadow, and on being questioned, confessed for what pur- 
pose he had ascended the mountain the previous night. 
After some further counsel on the. part of his adviser, the 
unhappy man consented to throw himself on Arner’s mercy, 
and confess everything. 
After praying and talking awhile with the Bailiff, the 
pastor went home and wrote to Arner, telling him of Hans 
Wiist’s disclosure of the day before, and its unexpected con- 
firmation through the Bailiff’s confession. Before this letter 
reached its destination, however, Arner had already become 
acquainted with the events of the preceding night from 
another source, as we shall learn presently. He wrote the 
pastor that he would come to Bonnal that very day, to hold 
a meeting about the boundary-stone, adding that it was his 
intention at the same time to enact a little comedy before the 
peasants, to cure them of their superstition. He would also 
bring his wife and children, he said, as they were anxious to 
be present at the comedy. 
When he had finished this letter, Arner went to his stable, 
and from his fifty cows chose out the finest for Hiibel-Rudy, 
and ordered it to be led to Bonnal to await his pleasure. 
Then he sat down and meditated awhile, earnestly and 
sadly, on the sentence he should pass on the Bailiff. After 
an early dinner, he set forth with his wife and children in 
the direction of the village. As they passed the laborers, 
who were busied in breaking stones, the nobleman descended 
from the carriage to inspect their work, and praised the 
good order and regularity which prevailed, in a way which
-P-A-G-E-81
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 71 
tonvinced even the dullest among them that not the slightest 
neglect or irregularity would have escaped his notice. 
When Arner reached the pastor’s house, he sent immedi- 
ately for young Meyer, whom he destined to fill the now 
vacant office of bailiff, and thus addressed him: ‘‘ Meyer, I 
am on the point of dismissing my Bailiff; but despite his 
offences, 4 could yet wish that during his life-time he may 
continue to receive some portion of the revenue of his office. 
You. sre in comfortable circumstances, and if I make you 
Bailiff, I suppose you would be willing to allow the old man 
one hundred florins a year out of your salary.” On receiv- 
Ing a submissive reply in the affirmative, Arner continued : 
‘* Now, Meyer, you must go with my secretary and the jus- 
tice Aebi to the tavern, and seal up all Hummel’s papers and 
accounts. You will have to keep a sharp look-out that none 
of the documents are secreted.” 
While the three men were fulfilling this order, the Bailiff’s 
wife approached the blackboard with a wet sponge. Meyer 
stopped her, and had a copy made of the following, which 
was written on the board in chalk: ‘‘ Saturday, the 18th, 
paid to Leonard’s man Joseph, three thalers.” The Bailiff 
and his wife refused at first to give any explanation regard- 
ing this entry, until the good pastor adjured Hummel not to 
aggravate the mischief by concealment, when he made a 
clean breast of the matter. 
Arner had the Bailiff, Wtist and Joseph brought to the 
parsonage, and submitted to a legal examination. When 
their depositions had been taken down, he ordered the bells 
to be rung to summon the people to the square under the 
linden-tree, where the village meetings were held. Arner’s 
wife Theresa and the pastor’s wife, with the children and 
servants of both families, took up their position in the 
churchyard, which commanded a view of the square. 
Arner first ordered the prisoners to be brought forth, and 
after they had read aloud the confessions they had previ-
-P-A-G-E-82
  72 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
ously made, he bade the Bailiff kneel down and receive his 
sentence, which he pronounced as follows: ‘‘ Unhappy man ! 
It grieves me to the heart to inflict upon you, in your old 
age, the punishment which necessarily follows misdeeds like 
yours. You have deserved death, not because Rudy’s 
meadow or my boundary-stone are worth a man’s life, but 
because a career of perjury and robbery can bring an 
unlimited amount of danger and suffering upon a whole 
community. Yet in consideration of your age, and of the 
fact that a part of your offences were committed against me 
personally, I have decided to spare your life. Your punish- 
ment shall be this: to-day, in company with all the over- 
seers of the village, and whoever wishes to go beside, you 
shall be carried to the boundary-stone, and in chains restore 
everything to its former condition. Then you shall be 
brought to the village jail, where for a fortnight the pastor 
shall visit you daily, and receive from you a full account of 
your past career. Two weeks from Sunday he shall relate 
from the pulpit the history of your life, with your domestic 
troubles, your hard-heartedness, your contempt of oaths, 
and your injustice to poor and rich alike; and this must all 
be confirmed by your own testimony. With this I would 
gladly discharge you ; but since it is necessary, where there 
are so many rude and unprincipled people, to set up an 
example and a warning, I must add one more penalty; to- 
morrow morning the executioner shall lead you under the 
gallows of Bonnal, and there bind your right hand toastake, 
and smear the first three fingers with an indelible black dye. 
But it is my express desire that no one shall imbitter this 
your hour of suffering by mockery or laughter, and that all 
shall look on silently, with uncovered heads.” 
Arner then condemned Hans Wiist to eight days’ im- 
prisonment, while Joseph, as a stranger, he banished from 
the territory, forbidding him to return, under penalty of 
being sent to the House of Correction.

CHAPTER XIV. 
A GHOSTLY COMEDY. 
Tr was now time for Arner’s little game to begin, when ta 
his surprise, the first move was made by the opposite party. 
The peasants had been greatly dissatisfied with the incredu- 
lity their pastor had manifested the night before, and the 
good man had also become obnoxious to the large land- 
owners, ever since he had announced from the pulpit that it 
was wrong in them to oppose Arner’s project of dividing 
a certain strip of meadow-land among the poor. Accord- 
ingly, a number of the citizens had held a council that morn- 
ing, and as a result of their deliberations, the hypocrite and 
miser Hartknopf now arose in the assembly, and began: 
*« Gracious Sir, is it allowable to bring forward an affair of 
conscience, in the name of the peasants of your faithful 
community of Bonnal?” 
‘¢T am ready to hear,” Arner replied. ‘* Who are you?” 
“‘T am Jacob Christopher Frederic Hartknopf, church- 
warden and elder of Bonnal, fifty-six years of age. And 
the overseers of the village have requested me, in the name 
of the community, to lay a statement before you, as they 
are not accustomed to speaking upon spiritual subjects.” 
“Well, Mr Hartknopf, to the point!” cried Arner 
impatiently. 
‘“*Gracious Sir, we have inherited from our ancestors a 
delief that the Devil and his spirits often appear to men; 
and since now it has become evident that our old belief in 
spirits is true (as none of us ever doubted for a moment),
-P-A-G-E-84
74 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
we felt we must take the liberty of informing our gracious 
master that our reverend pastor, God forgive him, is not of 
this belief. We know very well that your Grace is of the 
same opinion as the pastor regarding spirits; but since in 
matters of belief we must obey God rather than man, we 
hope your Grace will pardon us, if we humbly beg that 
in future our reverend pastor may teach our children from 
the stand-point of our old belief, and not talk any more 
against spirits, in which we are bound to believe. And we 
would request that a Sunday may be set apart before long, 
as a day of fasting and prayer, that we may do penance in 
sackcloth and ashes for the increasing sin of disbelief in 
spirits.” 
Arner and the parson could hardly repress their laughter 
until he had finished, but many of the peasants sprang to 
their feet, crying: ‘‘Gracious master! We all agree with 
what the church-warden has said.” 
Arner, however, put on his hat, and looking seriously 
around, said: ‘‘ Neighbors, there was no need of any orator 
for such folly as this! The whole affair, with the appear- 
ance of the Devil, rests upon error, and you ought to be 
ashamed to insult your wise and excellent pastor through 
such a wretched fellow as your church-warden ! ” 
‘But it is plain that the Devil appeared to the Bailiff 
last night, and tried to catch him,” broke in the peasants 
eagerly. 
‘You are laboring under a mistake, neighbors,” returned 
Arner; ‘‘and before supper-time you will blush for your 
stupidity.” 
‘¢ But, Sir,” they cried, ‘‘ we all heard the dreadful voice 
of Satan himself!” 
‘*T know very well that you heard shouts, accompanied by 
a bellowing and clanking. But how can you say certainly 
that it was the Devil? Might it not have been that one or 
more men took a fancy to frighten the Bailiff?”
-P-A-G-E-85
  
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 75 
This suggestion was indignantly repelled. ‘* Not ten, no, 
not twenty men all together, could have made such a noise; 
and if you had been there, gracious Sir, it never would have 
entered your head that it could be men at all.” 
‘« But, neighbors,” persisted Arner ; ‘‘ darkness is decep- 
tive, and when we are once startled, we see and hear every- 
thing double. I am quite certain that you are mistaken.” 
‘* No, gracious Sir, there is no possibility of that.” 
‘*T am almost inclined to think I could convince you of 
your error.” 
“Your Grace is joking!” they all cried. 
‘No, Tam not joking. If you will agree to divide the 
common, I will keep my word, and convince you that all the 
roaring and rattling was made by one man. Will you take 
the risk?” 
‘Yes, Sir, that we will! If you will do what you say, 
and prove to our entire satisfaction that it was one man who 
made all the noise we heard last night, we will agree to 
divide the common ; but otherwise not.” 
Arner hereupon drew a large white handkerchief ostenta- 
tiously from his pocket, and a few moments after, amid a 
peal of laughter from the churchyard, a tall stranger was 
seen approaching, armed with a dark basket and a lantern. 
‘¢ What fool is this, who walks about in broad daylight with 
a lighted lantern?” asked the peasants. 
‘¢Tt is my poulterer from Arnheim,” replied Arner. ‘+ Ho, 
Christopher! What do you want here?” 
“¢T have a story to tell, gracious Sir.” 
On receiving permission to proceed, the poulterer set down 
his basket, and began as follows: ‘‘ Gracious Sir, reverend 
pastor, and neighbors! Here are the pickaxe, the mattock, 
the spade, the brandy-bottle, the tobacco-pipe and the felt 
hat of your worthy Bailiff, which he left near the boundary- 
stone in his flight, when I drove him away from his fine job 
early this morning, and chased him down the mountain.”
-P-A-G-E-86
76 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
“¢ And are we to believe,” asked the peasants, ‘‘ that it 
was you who made all the noise? Master, this proof is not 
sufficient; we ask for another.” 
“¢ Just wait a moment!” said Arner. ‘‘ He has a lantern 
with him, and perhaps will be able to enlighten you a little. 
Only please be silent until he has done speaking.” 
The men obeyed, and the poulterer continued: ‘* Why are 
you not civil enough to let me finish? If you don’t listen to 
me, you will never hear the last of it, for there is not a syl- 
lable of truth in the Devil’s having appeared to the Bailiff. 
It was I who frightened him, —I, the poulterer, just as I 
stand here, with this basket, with a new black goat-skin 
stretched over it, because it rained yesterday morning. 
And I had this lantern hung to my basket in front, as you 
saw it just now. I was in the tavern at Hirzau at eleven 
last night, as I can call the landlord and ten other men tc 
witness. As I was coming over the mountain, it struck 
twelve in Bonnal, and just then I heard the Bailiff cursing 
and working, not a stone’s throw from the road. I recog- 
nized his voice, and wondered what he could be doing there 
at midnight, so I followed the sound. But I think the worthy 
Bailiff must have drunk a little more than was necessary, for 
he took me, poor sinner that I am, for the Devil himself. 
And when I saw that he was on the point of moving a 
boundary in our master’s forest, I thought to myself I’d 
give him a fine fright. So I tied his tools and my stick all 
together, and dragged them over the rocky road behind me, 
shouting at the top of my lungs: ‘Oh! Ah! Uh! Bailiff! 
You are mine!’ And I was not more than a stone’s throw 
from you, when you crept slowly along with your torches to 
the Bailiff’s assistance. But I didn’t want to frighten inno- 
cent men with my noise, so I turned and ran up the moun- 
tain to my basket, and then went home. This morning at 
six o’clock I went to the Castle and told my master the
-P-A-G-E-87
  
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 17 
story. Now, neighbors, how do you think I could get hold 
of this story and these tools before daylight this morning, if 
what I am telling you were not true?” 
Some of the peasants scratched their heads, and others 
laughed. 
‘Tf such a thing should happen again, neighbors,” added 
the poulterer, ‘‘I have a bit of friendly advice to give the 
watchman, as well as the honorable community at large, — 
let loose the biggest dog in the village, and you will soon 
find the Devil!”
-P-A-G-E-88
  18 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
CHAPTER XV. 
THE FORGIVING GENEROSITY OF A POOR MAN, AND THE 
PUNISHMENT OF A MALEFACTOR. 
THERE was a general murmur on every side when the 
poulterer had finished speaking. The peasants were vexed 
at their stupidity, the rich landowners cursed their folly in 
promising to divide the common, while the poor rejoiced at 
the triumph of Arner and their reverend pastor. Arner dis- 
missed the people after a few friendly words, and accom- 
panied the clergyman to the parsonage, where he warmly 
praised the good man for the faithful discharge of his duties, 
and added a more substantial token of appreciation, in the 
shape of a deed of gift of a small tithe-field in the village. 
Theresa, who stood by her husband’s side, placed in the 
pastor’s hands a beautiful bouquet of flowers, which his wife 
discovered the following morning was bound together by a 
string of pearls. 
In obedience to Arner’s summons, Htibel-Rudy now pre- 
sented himself. With outstretched hand, the nobleman said : 
“ Rudy, my grandfather did you a wrong in taking your 
meadow from you. But he was himself deceived, and you 
must try to forgive him.” 
‘¢ Ah, Sir,” answered the unfortunate man, ‘‘ I know well 
enough that it was not his fault, and even in the depths of 
my poverty I have never borne a grudge against him. How 
could he help it, when the Bailiff found false witnesses 
against me? My good old master often afterwards gave me 
alms and food, God bless him! And if, Sir, he had only 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 79 
gone about among us, and talked with us as you have done, 
things would have been very different.” 
‘¢- You must forget that now, Rudy. The meadow is yours 
again, and I wish you joy with all my heart.” 
Rudy tried in vain to express his delight and gratitude, 
but in a moment tears rushed to his eyes, and clasping his 
hands, he exclaimed: ‘‘O gracious Sir, my mother’s bless- 
ing is upon me! She said to me before she died: ‘ Rudy, 
all will go well with you.’ Ah, if she could only have lived 
to see this day!” 
Arner and the pastor were both much affected, and it was 
after a pause that the former spoke: ‘‘ I had almost for- 
gotten to say that the Bailiff is bound to pay you arrears 
and costs.” 
‘‘May I say a word?” asked the parson. ‘It is true, 
Rudy, that he owes you all the arrears, but he is in very 
straitened circumstances, and I know you are too kind- 
hearted to bring him to beggary in his old age. Have pity 
upon his distress, Rudy!” 
‘¢T never should think of the arrears for a moment, rev- 
erend Sir. And if the Bailiff is poor, — why, Sir, there is hay 
enough from the meadow to pasture more than three cows, 
and if I can keep two, I shall have enough and to spare. 
So I am very willing to allow the Bailiff hay enough for one 
cow, as long as he lives.” 
Arner praised Rudy’s resolution, but urged him to take 
time for reflection before acting upon it, and said as the 
peasant took his leave: ‘‘ Below in the parsonage stable you 
will find a cow, which I give you to reconcile you to my dear 
grandfather, who did you a wrong. I have given orders 
that a load of. hay shall be carried to your house from the 
Bailiff’s barn; and if you need any wood to repair your 
house or stable, you may cut it in my forest.” 
After Rudy’s departure, all those assembled at the parson-

age remained silent for a while, and their eyes were filled 
with tears. Presently the children of both families begged 
permission to go and see Rudy’s poor children, and the par- 
ents gave their consent. Arner had brought with him in his 
carriage a roasted quarter of veal for the destitute family, 
and the pastor’s wife had made a nourishing soup to go with 
it; Arner’s servant was sent ahead with this food, while 
the whole party followed. When they entered Rudy’s door, 
the house seemed to contain nothing but ragged, sickly, 
half-starved children ; everything denoted extreme poverty. 
‘‘And this Rudy,” Arner said to the ladies, ‘‘is willing to 
give up a third part of the hay from his meadow, to the very 
man who has kept him in this state of wretchedness for ten 
years!” 
‘¢That must never be!” exclaimed Theresa impetuously. 
‘¢T cannot bear to think of that man, with all his children, 
giving a single penny that belongs to him to that abandoned 
wretch!” 
‘¢ My dear,” said Arner, ‘‘ would you restrict the course 
of that virtue and generosity which God has so exalted 
through suffering and want that it has just brought tears to 
your eyes?” 
‘No, that I will not!” she cried. ‘‘ Let him give away 
all his possessions, if he can; God will never forsake such 
a man.” 
Arner turned to Rudy, and bade him give his children 
something to eat. But little Rudy plucked his father by the 
sleeve, and whispered: ‘‘ Father, I want to carry something 
to Gertrude.” 
Arner caught the last word, and inquired what the child 
was saying. Rudy told him of the stolen potatoes, of his 
mother’s death-bed, and of the constant kindness shown 
them by the mason and his wife, adding: ‘‘ Gracious Sir, 
this day is a joyful one indeed; but I cannot enjoy a single
-P-A-G-E-91
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 81 
mouthful, unless I may invite these good people to share 
it.” 
It would be too long a story to relate how the women 
praised the mason’s wife, how little Rudy ran in great 
excitement to invite Leonard and Gertrude to supper, how 
the worthy couple could not be prevailed upon to come, until 
Arner sent his servant with express injunctions to that effect, 
when they appeared abashed and with downcast eyes; and 
how, despite the kindness of Theresa and the pastor’s wife, 
the children were not quite happy until Gertrude’s arrival, 
when they thronged about her with smiles and caresses. 
Arner and Theresa stood watching this scene a long time, 
and took leave silently, with tears in their eyes. ‘‘ Drive 
slowly for a while,” said Arner to the coachman. As they 
were mounting the hill, they saw the poulterer approaching, 
and Theresa said to her husband: ‘‘ This man ought to have 
something for his pains, since he is really at the bottom of 
the whole matter.” 
‘‘ Christopher!” cried Arner, ‘‘ my wife doesn’t think it 
quite fair for you to have played the Devil for nothing,” and 
reached him a couple of thalers. 
“‘Gracious Sir,” said the poulterer with a low bow, ‘‘I 
should like to play the Devil every day of my life!” 
“Provided,” returned Arner, ‘‘ you could be sure the 
dogs were kept chained up.” 
“Very true, Sir!” was the reply, as the carriage drove 
on. 
In pursuance of Arner’s decree, the Bailiff was led that 
evening to the mile-stone, and compelled to restore every- 
thing to its former condition. He was accompanied by an 
excited and disorderly crowd of villagers; the schoolboys 
fired missiles at him from the walls and trees, as he went 
by, while the girls stood hand in hand in long rows behind 
the wayside hedges, and laughed at the strange procession.
-P-A-G-E-92
  82 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
Threats and maledictions were showered upon the Bailiff 
from every house he passed — except one; in Leonard’s 
cottage no living soul was to be seen, and the doors and 
windows were closed. 
To avoid a repetition of this scene on the following day, 
the strictest orders were issued that none should be allowed 
to accompany the prisoner to the gallows, except those who 
first attended the morning service in the church; and senti- 
nels were posted to prevent any strangers from gaining 
access to the village and joining the procession. Those who 
should attend the service, and subsequently witness the 
Bailiff’s punishment, were to conduct themselves with order 
and propriety, on pain of being detained in Bonnal under 
arrest. 
The parson’s sermon on the wretchedness of sin and the 
joy of righteousness went to the hearts of all his congrega- 
tion ; it seemed as if the Bailiff were a mirror in the pastor’s 
hands, from which each one of the multitude saw his own 
sins reflected. After his discourse was over, the clergyman 
descended from the pulpit and talked kindly with the pris- 
oner ; and on perceiving that Hummel was faint with hunger 
and exhaustion, he ordered food and drink to be brought 
from the parsonage. When the Bailiff’s strength was some- 
what revived, the procession set forth, the pastor walking by 
his side and praying aloud all the way, while the people fol- 
lowed in deep silence, and the death-bell of Bonnal tolled its 
solemn knell. 
Arrived at the spot, the Bailiff, with bare feet and uncoy- 
ered head, stood before the multitude, and was made to re- 
peat three times the words: ‘‘ Here I have deserved to die!” 
A hangman answered in a loud voice: ‘‘ Yes, thou hast 
deserved that thy bones should rot here, and the birds of 
heaven feed upon thy flesh!” 
Three times the Bailiff made answer: ‘‘I have deserved 
it!

** Servant of justice, he is pardoned! Kill him not!” cried 
the powerful voice of the judge. 
‘¢ What shall I do to him, then? ” 
“Thou shalt bind him to the arms of the gallows, and 
after fastening his hand to a stake, thou shalt paint the fin- 
gers of the perjurer thrice, with an indelible black dye.” 
During the execution of this sentence, the judge, turning 
to the people, pronounced the following injunction: 
‘‘Hearken, ye people! ‘Your master and father bids me 
say to you that whosoever among you does not dread such a 
disgrace more than death, he and his are on the high road to 
the same misery in which this poor man is involved! °’

CHAPTER XVI. 
DOMESTIC ORDER AND DISORDER. 
As long as the death-bell tolled in the village, Gertrude 
prayed at home with her children. She then resolved, in 
accordance with her promise to the dying Catharine, to pay 
a visit to her good neighbor Hiibel-Rudy, and see what assist- 
ance she could render after his change of fortune. She 
found the children had just risen from their beds, and the 
father himself looked as if he had not yet had time to dress 
himself properly. The children’s clothes lay scattered about 
the floor, and the cat was seated on the table, beside the 
dirty plate from which she had eaten her supper the night 
before. Gertrude tried to make Rudy comprehend what 
would be the result if such a condition of things continued, 
but at first he hardly seemed to understand of what she was 
speaking. At length he answered, with tears in his eyes: 
“You are right, neighbor ; but, indeed, it could not be other- 
wise while we were so wretchedly poor.” 
‘¢That is the very reason, Rudy, why you must be willing 
to have help and advice now; for this is a deep-rooted 
disease, which you must set to work in earnest to cure.” 
‘¢Oh, I suppose the disease will cure itself when I have 
enough to eat, and am not tormented by the hunger of my 
children.” 
‘¢ Don’t deceive yourself! It will not be so easy as you 
think to accustom yourself to good, orderly habits. But, 
Rudy, we will waste no time in talking; we will go to work
-P-A-G-E-95

at once. Before the sun sets, this room must look so differ- 
ently that nobody will know it. Tables, windows and floor 
must all be scrubbed, and the room must be aired every day. 
I am sure your children look so sickly just because they have 
no pure air to breathe, day or night. It was a misfortune 
that your wife neglected her household so toward the last! 
However poor a woman is, she ought at least to do for her 
husband and children what costs nothing.” 
“So my mother often told her; but she was so utterly 
broken down by our poverty, that she did not even try to do 
what she could. Ever since yesterday it has seemed to me 
as if she ought to come back and share my prosperity, as 
she did my adversity.” 
‘She is better off than any of us now, Rudy! But the 
best way of cherishing her memory is to bring up your chil- 
dren so that they shall not be as unhappy as she. Believe 
me, in bringing up a child, trifles are of very great impor- 
tance, such as whether it gets up half an hour earlier or 
later in the morning, and whether it throws its Sunday 
clothes into a corner, or folds them up carefully and lays 
them away; and it is very necessary that children should 
not be left to themselves all day, but that they should know, 
from the time they get up in the morning till they go to bed 
at night, just what they have to do. If these little things 
are not regarded, the most docile and happy-hearted girl, 
when she grows up and has children of her own, may 
become so despondent and unlike herself that no one would 
recognize her.” 
‘So it was with my wife,” sighed Rudy. 
‘*T knew her parents,” resumed Gertrude. ‘‘ There was 
never any order in the household ; and then she fell into the 
hands of the Parson Flieg, who filled her head with dreams 
and speculations about the revelation of St. John, as if she 
had nothing in the world to do but read about them.”
-P-A-G-E-96
  86 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
‘¢Yes, I was sometimes afraid she would set the house on 
fire, she was so absent-minded over her books. They were 
her sanctuary and her heaven, so that she forgot me and the 
ehildren and everything else.” 
“That is a sad state of things!” remarked Gertrude. 
‘* Books should be to a woman like her Sunday gown, and 
work like her everyday clothes.” 
‘« She wore this Sunday gown every day.” 
‘< Until it was so badly worn as not even to be fit for an 
everyday dress.” 
‘* What made me feel worst of all,” said Rudy, ‘‘ was that 
with all her. slovenliness, she was always so pious, and made 
the children say their prayers.” 
“Ah, but there can be no true piety without energy, and 
when one is slovenly, one can neither pray properly one’s self, 
nor teach it to one’s children.”’ 
“‘You are right; when she ne longer had her usual food, 
she began to neglect her books, and instead of praying with 
the children, only wept over them.” 
“Let that be a warning to you, Rudy! Teach your ® 
children to pray, that they may be willing to work, and to 
work, that they may never grow tired of praying.” 
‘¢T will send the two oldest af once to a seamstress, to 
learn to sew.” 
‘¢ But you must clothe them first, before they can go out 
of this room.” 
‘‘ Well, then, buy them some cloth for clothes; I know 
nothing of such things. I will borrow the money to-day.” 
‘Borrow nothing, Rudy. I will buy the cloth, and you 
shall pay me after the hay harvest.” 
“* Why not borrow?” 
‘¢ Because it is a part of good house-keeping never to take 
a thing from one nail to hang it on another, and because out 
of a hundred men who lend money, there are not ten who do
-P-A-G-E-97
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 87 
not take an undue advantage. You must learn to keep what 
God has given back to you and your children after your long 
suffering.” 
Rudy asked Gertrude in some concern whether she then 
disapproved of his promise to divide the crop of his meadow 
with the Bailiff. She had not heard of the project, and 
although it seemed to her hastily conceived, she could not 
but praise the forgiving generosity which had dictated it. 
While they were talking, Gertrude washed the children, 
combed their hair with a gentleness to which they were not 
accustomed, and made them put on their clothes with more 
care than usual. Then, bringing a tub, a broom and some 
brushes from her own house, she set about cleaning the 
room. After showing Rudy how: to continue the work with 
the aid of the children, she returned home, telling him to 
send the children to her in the afternoon, if they had been 
good and helpful. When she had gone, Rudy stood still for 
a little while, and thought within himself: ‘+ It would be like 
being in heaven to have such a wife!” And when he sent 
the children to her in the afternoon, for the first time in 
many years he took pains to see that their faces and hands 
were clean, and their hair and clothes in order, so that they 
themselves were surprised, and the neighbors who saw them 
go by said to each other: ‘‘He surely means to marry 
again!” 
The mason’s children were all at their spinning-wheels, 
and although they greeted their guests joyfully, they did not 
stop working for a moment. ‘‘ Hurry and get through, and 
then you can play with your little friends till six o’clock,’”’ 
said Gertrude. Rudy’s children stood in open-mouthed 
wonder at the beautiful work and the cheerful aspect of the 
room. ‘Can you spin?” she asked. 
‘* No,” they answered. 
‘‘Then you must learn, my dears. My children wouldn’t
-P-A-G-E-98
  88 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
seli their knowledge of it at any price, and are happy enough 
on Saturday, when they each get their few kreutzers. The 
year is long, my dears, and if we earn something every 
week, at the end of the year there is a lot of money, without 
our knowing how we came by it.”’ 
‘‘Oh, please teach us!” implored the children, nestling 
close to the good woman. 
‘“¢ Willingly,” Gertrude replied ; ‘‘ come every day, if you 
like, and you will soon learn.” 
Meanwhile, the others had finished their work, and put 
away their yarn and wheels; they took their visitors by the 
hand, and all the children sprang merrily ‘about in the meadow 
under the trees. Gertrude’s children were more careful than 
their companions to avoid the mud and the thorns, and took 
heed to their clothes. They tied up their stockings and 
shoes when they became undone, and would often say to 
Rudy’s children: ‘‘ You are losing your garter,” or ‘¢ You 
are getting dirty,” or ‘‘ You will tear your dress on the 
thorns.” Their playfellows took it all in good part, for they 
saw that the mason’s children did everything themselves 
which they prescribed, and were not putting on airs. 
On the stroke of six, Gertrude’s children ran into the 
house, like birds to their nests at sundown. ‘ Will you 
come with us? We are going to pray now,” they said to 
their visitors; and as they were playing the game called 
‘¢eat’s tail,” they led the long procession through the 
meadow, up the steps, and to the very table where they 
seated themselves. ‘‘ Must you not go home to prayers, 
my dears?” inquired Gertrude of the little strangers. 
‘* We don’t pray till we go to bed,” replied the eldest. 
** And when must you go to bed?” 
‘How do I know?” said the child ; and another answered : 
* When it begins to grow dark.” 
‘¢ Well, then, you can pray with us, and then it will be
-P-A-G-E-99
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
time for you to go home.’’ Gertrude heard her own chil- 
dren pray in turn, and then, after letting Rudy’s children 
repeat the prayers they knew, she accompanied them to the 
corner of the house with a cheery parting, bidding them 
come again soon,

CHAPTER XVII. 
DISTURBANCE REIGNS THROUGHOUT THE VILLAGE, EXCEPT IN 
ONE HOUSE. 
Turoven his sympathetic kindness, the pastor so won the 
confidence of the imprisoned Bailiff that the latter related to 
him in detail the history of his life, involving, as it did, the 
life of the whole village, so that the pastor could look into 
every household and see the hidden springs of action, clear 
as ina mirror. It would be impossible to describe the uni- 
versal panic which prevailed at the intelligence that the 
Bailiff was confessing everything to the pastor. Every- 
where people put their heads together mysteriously, and pale, 
frightened faces were seen. Husbands and wives who had 
been quarrelling suddenly became friends, and the most 
obstinate children all at once grew docile and obedient. Cir- 
cumstances and events which had long been forgotten were 
mentioned without any apparent connection, and on every 
side the compassion which the Bailiff had excited vanished 
as speedily as it had come. The overseers were the most 
anxious, and calling a meeting of all the well-to-do peasants 
in the village, they resolved to bribe the Bailiff to silence. 
All their efforts in this direction, however, were vain, and 
they accordingly bent their energies on making mischief 
between Arner and the pastor. 
About this time, a report began to circulate that every- 
thing had not been as it should be at the last assembly of 
the people, and that the poulterer had blinded everybody with 
devil’s tricks. The overseers were the most eager in dis- 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 91 
seminating this nonsense, since it suited their own schemes. 
Many an old ghost-story was brought to light under the 
present state of things. People talked of haunted houses, 
and recalled the story of the crow which used to come and 
sit on a particular branch of the smith’s tree, whenever a 
misfortune was in store for him, until he finally cut down the 
tree, and burned it up; and since then, nothing but good 
luck had befallen his house, — except, to be sure, that the 
smith himself had lost his wits, and had to be bound hand 
and foot. The mothers talked to their children of the black 
man who would come and catch them if they were naughty, 
and the wife of the younger Kienholz, who had taught her 
children to ridicule the idea of ghosts and witches, in order 
to curry favor with the pastor, now made them recite the 
prayer against bad spirits every morning and evening. 
Even the innocent game of ‘ cat’s tail,” which Leonard’s 
and Rudy’s children played together, was made a cause of 
suspicion and gossip. The cheesemonger’s wife, who seemed 
to have been born for the express purpose of extracting 
poison from honey, and making elephants out of gnats, 
unluckily met Rudy’s daughter Maggie in the street, and 
resolved to get to the bottom of the mysterious game which 
people were beginning to shake their heads over. She gave 
her hand to the child with apparent friendliness, and the fol- 
lowing cross-examination took place: 
‘Did you children have a good play at the mason’s yes- 
terday?” 
‘¢ That we did! ” 
“Was there a pretty cat in the room, my child?” 
Ss Wess”: 
“A black one?” 
‘* Coal-black.” 
‘¢ But she had fiery eyes? ” 
‘¢ Yes, when she was under the bench.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  92 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
«¢ What did the cat do?” 
“ Nothing.” 
“Did she sit still all the time?” 
‘* No, she came rubbing against our legs, and once almost 
jumped up in my lap.” 
‘¢ During prayers?” 
‘Do you suppose cats know when we are praying?” 
“Did you touch her?” 
“¢ Yes indeed.” 
‘¢ During prayers?” 
‘* Yes, when she came too near us.” 
‘*Don’t you have to fold your hands while you pray?” 
‘¢ To be sure.”’ 
‘¢Then how could you touch her?” 
‘¢ With our legs under the table.” 
‘¢ But she was coal-black, wasn’t she?” 
‘Not all over.” 
“But almost black?” 
scoYies. 
“« And she had fiery eyes? ” 
‘¢T told you so, when she was under the bench.”’ 
From this conversation, which was immediately reported 
right and left, with numerous additions, the rumor soon 
spread that the cat in question was no ordinary cat, and that 
things were not as they should be in the mason’s household. 
For a long time no one said anything of the matter to 
Leonard or Rudy, but they noticed that people looked at 
them strangely, and the children often came home in tears, 
complaining that the nicest children in the village refused to 
play with them. Finally a neighbor came to the mason, and 
told him that one of the chief gossips of the place, who went 
by the name of ‘‘ Glib-tongued Peg,” had been circulating 
wonderful stories about his family, and mentioned the absurd 
tumors which were going the rounds. Leonard turned pale 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 93 
with anger, and no longer master of himself, ran like a mad- 
man to Peg’shouse. She was outside at the well, with some 
of her cronies, to whom she had just been relating the story 
afresh, and was so alarmed by his sudden appearance and 
the angry accusations with which he assailed her, that she 
immediately took back her words, and confessed in the pres- 
ence of all the by-standers that her slanders had no founda- 
tion. 
This put an end to the persecution of the mason’s house- 
hold, but the peasants were all the more zealous in decrying 
the poulterer, and in asserting that he had hoodwinked them 
all by his magic arts. When Christopher came to Bonnal, as 
usual, to buy chickens, pigeons and eggs for the Castle, no 
one would sell him so much as an egg-shell, and he was not 
allowed to enter a single house. At a loss what to do, 
the poulterer finally seated himself with his basket on the 
bench beside the dwelling of his old friend Leupi, exclaim- 
ing in vexation: ‘‘ My Devil’s job and the fee I got for it 
have turned out badly for me, neighbor!” 
‘* God forbid that you should engage in such a thing for 
the sake of a fee!” cried Leupi, rising from the bench, and 
withdrawing from so dangerous a neighborhood. 
An hour later, the whole village was in possession of the 
intelligence that the poulterer had himself confessed to 
having a compact with the Devil. This rumor was an addi- 
tional encouragement to the rich peasants and overseers, in 
their resolution to prevent the promised division of the com- 
mon. The only question was, how this end was to be accom- 
plished. They would have preferred to withdraw their consent 
openly, on the ground that the promise had been extorted 
from them on false pretences, put as their courage was not 
sufficient for this, they took council together as to the best 
means of putting off the evil day. Two opinions prevailed , 
one was, to postpone the matter until the autumn, and then
-P-A-G-E-104

represent to Arner the impossibility of dividing the meadow 
at that season, when they were all over-crowded with cattle, 
and not in condition to dispense with the common pasture- 
ground. The other recommendation was to give up a certain 
piece of the land to be divided by way of trial, selecting for 
the purpose a worthless corner of the meadow, full of thorns 
and swamps, which it would be impossible to cultivate prop- 
erly, so that Arner would be indignant at the apparent 
laziness of those to whom it was intrusted. After a long 
discussion, it was decided to adopt both of these counsels, 
and to bring them before Arner by means of the new Bailiff 
Meyer. The latter objected at first to being employed as a 
tool in such an enterprise, but his scruples were overcome 
by the persuasions and ridicule of his influential fellow- 
townsmen. 
Meanwhile, no one suspected that Arner was employing a 
portion of almost every day in becoming acquainted with 
the common in question, examining thoroughly the whole 
conformation of the land, and deciding just which portions 
were good for pasturage, which for agriculture, and which 
were only fit for reeds and lumber. 
The only cottage in the village which was free from the 
turbulent unrest of this period was that of Gertrude. She 
alone seemed to possess a soul untainted by the moral filth 
around her, and always had a stock of mottoes on hand 
which made the path of duty plainer for herself and others. 
Some of these were: ‘Be silent about everything which 
does not concern you”; ‘* Do not speak of that which you 
do not understand” ; ‘* Step aside when people speak either 
too loud or too softly”; ‘‘ Learn well what it is necessary 
for you to use”; ‘‘ Let your head and heart always be in the 
right place, and never in many at once, but always with 
you”; ‘Serve with body and soul those to whom you are 
indebted, and those you love.” Guided by such sayings as
-P-A-G-E-105
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 95 
these, she had attained to a remarkable degree of domestic 
and social wisdom, and throughout the confusion which 
reigned in the village, no word escaped her lips which could 
give rise to misunderstandings, not a syllable which could 
provoke either enmity or ridicule. 
Rudy’s children came to her almost every day, and con- 
stantly learned from her to take more heed to themselves and 
all about them. While they were spinning and sewing, she 
taught them to count and cipher, for she regarded arithmetic 
as the foundation of all intellectual order. Her method was 
to let the children count their threads or stitches both for- 
wards and backwards, and add and subtract, multiply and 
divide the result by different numbers. The children vied 
with each other in this game, trying to see who could be 
quickest and surest in the exercise. When they were tired, 
they sang songs, and night and morning Gertrude prayed 
with them. Her favorite prayer, and the one she taught the 
children first, was as follows: 
O God so good and kind, 
Of all our gifts the spring, 
Without whom nothing is, 
From whom comes everything, — 
A healthy body give, 
And grant that in this frame 
The soul unharmed may live, 
The conscience pure remain.

IT IS ONLY FRIENDS IN NEED THAT ARE FRIENDS INDEED. 
Tue exhortations of the good pastor had awakened such a 
sense of hopeless remorse in the Bailiff, that he felt as if no 
one in the world could look upon him with compassion. He 
often sat motionless in the parson’s room, his eyes filled with 
fears, and sometimes refused to drink the wine which was 
placed. before him. One day, while he was in this state, the 
doc: opened, and Hiibel-Rudy entered. The Bailiff gazed 
at him a few moments speechles” with terror, then sinking 
on his knees, he implored forgiveness of the injured man. 
‘Rise, Bailiff !”’ said the pastor; ‘‘he has long since for- 
given you.” 
They helped the wretched man to his feet, and he con- 
fessed, trembling, that it had seemed to him as if Rudy’s 
mother would certainly appear behind her son. ** But you 
know she is dead,” said Rudy. 
“T know it! Yet it seemed as if she must be here to 
reproach me for her wrongs. I suppose she cursed me with 
her dying breath for all I made her suffer.” 
‘*No, Bailiff, God be praised!” exclaimed the pastor; 
“the good Catharine forgave and prayed for you in her last 
hours, and wished you all manner of good.” 
Rudy repeated the dying message of his mother, which 
brought sweetest comfort to the soul of the repentant man. 
When the pastor told him of Rudy’s generous offer to allow 
him fodder for one cow from his newly recovered meadow.

Hummel was-too much moved to speak ; yet for the first time 
since his captivity he felt strengthened and refreshed. 
The Bailiff’s wife, meanwhile, was in a wretched condition. 
Prostrated by the fright and sorrow of the last few days, ” 
she had unfortunately fallen into the hands of the quack 
doctex, Lreufaug, who gave her some of his so-called ‘‘ heav- 
enly drops,” which rapidly increased her bad symptoms 
without her suspecting the cause. When the Bailiff heard 
of hg® illness, he obtained permission from the pastor to 
return home for the night. He found his wife much changed 
in his absence, but she rejoiced to see him, and the two 
talked long and confidentially together of all that had be- 
fallen them since their separation. 
‘¢No you know,” she asked presently, ‘‘ who has shown 
me most kindness during this time? But you would never 
guess# Hans Wiist has come every evening since you were 
taken prisoner, and has split wood, drawn water, and done 
whatever I needed. Then Hitibel-Rudy and Gertrude have 
been very kind; but she is angry now because I would take 
Treufaug’s medicine, which she says she knows has poisoned 
a great many people.” 
“*T certainly should not have let you take it if I had been 
here,” replied her husbaud. ‘* But how was it with my 
friends? I suppose they treated you worst of all?” 
‘‘You are pretty nearly right. At first they were very 
friendly, and made me all sorts of promises, provided I 
would prevent you from implicating any of them in your 
statements. But all of a sudden, for no apparent reason, 
they grew furious against us, and uttered the most dreadful 
threats. Then Glib-tongued Peg came running to me almost 
beside herself with rage, after the scene with Leonard at the 
well, and cried at the top of her voice, so that she could be 
heard through the whole street: ‘It is all your fault! Yours 
is a cursed house, and whoever has anything to do with you 
 
-P-A-G-E-108

gets into trouble!’ But Kriecher was worst of all. He has 
never lost an opportunity of mocking us in our misfortune; 
and the other day he actually thrust out his tongue at me in 
the public street, and said we might now be glad ourselves 
of the pastor’s alms, of which we had tried to defraud him.” 
‘* But I’ll venture to say he has not done that sir 3e last 
Wednesday,” said the Bailiff. 
‘You are right; but why?” ‘ 
“ Because he had his reward Tuesday night. You*know 
every Tuesday afternoon the beggars come to the parsonage 
for bread. Kriecher sent one vf his children, with the mes- 
sage that he lay sick in bed and had not a mouthful to eat in 
the house. But the pastor was not to be imposed upon, and 
sent back word he must come himself, which he finally did 
at twilight. I was in the next room, and I never shall jorget 
the rzz>-w!th Wwnich the pastor brought his fist down @ the 
table, and took the fellow to task for his meanness. Kriecher 
mumbled something about being an unlucky man who was 
always slandered, but the pastor bade him depart out of his 
sight, and thank Heaven that an aged parson could not use 
his cane against him as he deserved.” 
While the Bailiff and his wife were thus thattide together, 
a conspiracy was on foot among tize unscrupulous men of the 
village, and as the prisoner was returning to his captivity at 
five o’clock in the morning, he was suddenly accosted by a 
man who lay half concealed behind an old nut-tree near the 
path. He started back at first, but his interlocutor, com- 
ing close to him, shouted out: ‘‘Is it really you, Bailiff? 
I thought you were locked up, and here you are in the 
street!” 
Hummel was convinced by the insolence of the fellow’s 
manner, and the smell of brandy about him, that he was 
the tool of others. All the way to the parsonage the pris- 
oner was pursued by a loud stream of invective, which made 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
LEONARD AND’ GERTRUDE. 99 
many people rise from their beds and run to the window to 
jrquire the cause of the disturbance. This was precisely 
what the originators of the plot desired, since if it could 
become village talk that the Bailiff was allowed to go home 
at night, this might be reported to Arner, to the prejudice of 
fhe pastor. The latter, however, wrote of the affair himself 
to Arner, as he was just then sending a letter to him by 
Michael, in the bearer’s behalf. 
When, after some delay, Michael was admitted to the noble- 
man’s presence, Arner measured him from head to foot with 
a serious glance, and then bade him give a full account of 
the robberies which had taken place at the Castle in his 
grandfather’s time. Michael obeyed, and related how he, 
together with the Bailiff’s servants, had taken unthreshed 
grain from the barns of the Castle, letting it down with ropes 
into the moat, and conveying it thence to the tavern; how a 
hundred times by night he had removed the Castle mark 
from the best oak and fir trees, and then helped the peasants 
to cut them down as their own property ; how they had often 
played at the tavern with the Castle servants for tools, ropes 
or baskets; how at the present day many peasants were 
wearing clothes lined with stolen sacks, while in all the 
houses round about were portions of wagons and ploughs, 
wine-casks, etc., bearing the Castle brand, or from which 
this had been cut; and how all the trades-people, smith, 
locksmith, wagoner, carpenter, joiner, tailor and shoemaker, 
had worked for the Bailiff without wages, in consideration 
of the various articles he could procure for them from the 
Castle. 
Michael’s open, ingenuous manner, and the frankness with 
which he related the evil practices in which he himself had 
borne a part, so won Arner’s confidence that he conversed 
with him at some length about the affairs of the village, and 
dismissed’ him finally with orders to make out a list of all 
the goods that had been stolen from the Castle.

CHAPTER XIX. 
THE NEW BAILIFF FINDS HIS OFFICE A PERPLEXING ONE. 
Micuazr had scarcely departed before the Bailiff Meyer 
appeared. He returned Arner’s friendly greeting with so 
constrained a manner, that the nobleman said to himself 
with a sigh: ‘‘ He has hardly been Bailiff a week, and looks 
already as if he could betray his country!” 
Meyer soon began to insinuate that there would be many 
difficulties in the way of dividing the common, and that in 
his humble opinion it would be better to make trial first of a 
small portion of it, for instance, the corner next the forest. 
‘¢ Which corner do you mean?” inquired Arner. 
‘¢The uppermost corner, between the fir-trees and the 
hill.” 
“That one?” — with a penetrating look. 
“Yes, — unless your Grace would prefer another.” 
‘¢*But” (with another sharp glance) ‘‘ you are speaking 
of this one?” 
“Yes.” 
“« And you are quite in earnest?” 
‘*There are many men in the village who hold this 
opinion.” 
** And you agree with them?” 
ee Ye.” 
“¢ Are you acquainted with this corner?’ 
“¢ Partially.” 
‘*You ought to know it thoroughly, since you own some 
Jand adjoining.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 101 
“T do know it pretty well, gracious Sir.” 
*¢ But you suppose I do not?” 
‘TI didn’t think of that.” 
“Of what?” 
‘Of your not knowing it.” 
‘¢Would you have recommended it to me if you had 
supposed I was acquainted with it?” 
‘¢T am very sorry.” 
“¢ For what?” 
‘¢ For having recommended it to you.” 
«¢ And why?” 
‘¢ Because you seem to think it is good for nothing.” 
“Don’t you think so too?” 
“¢ T— can’t exactly praise it.’’ 
‘¢ Why, then, did you recommend it to me?” 
‘The overseers were all agreed that I must do it.” 
‘¢ And what was their object?” 
“¢T do not know.” 
‘¢ That I may believe or not; but at all events, one thing 
is settled,—not only the corner, but the whole common, 
must be divided, and that without delay.” 
** Your Grace will not be angry if I say one word more?” 
began Meyer anew. 
*¢ Certainly not.” 
‘¢It will hardly be possible to divide the meadow this 
summer.” 
‘¢ Why not?” 
‘* Because nobody in the village is in condition to keep the 
cattle in the stalls, and do without the pasturage.” 
‘* Js fodder scarce in your village?” 
‘Yes, they say there is very little, and a great many 
cattle.” 
“What do you mean by ‘they eat Don’t you know 
certainly?”
-P-A-G-E-112
102 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
‘¢ Not so altogether certainly, gracious Sir.” 
*‘ Ah, indeed! But you probably know how much fodder 
you have yourself? ” 
‘© Well, yes.” 
‘‘Have you enough to be able to keep your cattle in the 
stable?” 
‘¢T can’t deny that I have.” 
‘¢ And the harvests have been so good this last year that 
I should suppose all the peasants would be as well off as 
you. But in order to be sure, it will be well to count the 
cattle and measure the hay. You must take the beadle with 
you to-day and do this; then we shall see how far the com-, 
mon is needed this summer.” 
The terrified Meyer still had one more promise on his 
conscience, and plucking up courage, stammered that the 
pastor had been letting the Bailiff out of prison at night. 
‘Do you report this of your own accord, or at the insti- 
gation of others?” asked Arner. 
After some hesitation the answer came: ‘‘ They bade me 
report it.” 
‘¢ Who?” 
‘« The overseers.” 
*¢ Their names?” 
Deadly pale, Meyer gave the desired information. 
‘* And how,” pursued Arner, ‘‘did you communicate with 
these gentlemen? Did you see them separately, or were 
they all together, when they gave you their commands?” 
“ They were all together.” 
‘6 Where?” 
*¢ At Kienholz’s house.” 
* And for what purpose?” 
‘¢T— don’t exactly know. I was only there a moment.” 
‘* But I suppose you know what they were doing during 
that moment?”
-P-A-G-E-113
    LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 108 
‘‘ Well, yes, — they were trying to prevent the division of 
the common.” 
“‘And you allowed yourself to be used as a tool, and 
came to me with lies, to bring about this end? ” 
The Bailiff stood in guilty silence, with downcast eyes. 
Arner pitied him, and said: ‘‘ Meyer, as this is your first 
offence, I will overlook it; but beware of deceiving me 
again! Now go, and with the beadle’s assistance, do what 
I bade you. Bring me the list to-morrow.” 
It was in no enviable frame of mind that the Bailiff re- 
turned to the conclave to announce the result of his media- 
tion. His reception was not such as to make him desire to 
' prolong his stay, so he set forth almost immediately in pur- 
suit of the beadle, without suspecting that a messenger from 
the indignant landowners had preceded him. He was much 
surprised, as well as vexed, to learn from the beadle’s little 
daughter that her father had just started for market, and 
would not return before night. He was at first suspicious, 
and questioned her sharply, but the little maid held stoutly 
to her assertion, and not until the baffled magistrate had 
turned his back in disgust, did she burst into a peal of 
merry laughter at the face of the new Bailiff, who had 
looked as if he were ready to cry, simply because she had 
not been able to find her father behind the stove ! 
The discomfited Meyer returned to Kienholz’s house, and 
told the overseers that one of them must help him in the 
beadle’s place. No one, however, would consent to perform 
this office, and the Bailiff was fairly nonplussed. At length 
Hiigi suggested that he should let each proprietor make a 
statement of the amount of hay and the number of cattle he 
possessed. The Bailiff reflected a moment, and then said: 
‘Well, only the statement must be made on oath.” 
“Yes, on oath, of course!” answered the peasants, wink- 
ing at each other. And thus the required list was finally 
completed.   
-P-A-G-E-114
  104 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
Early in the morning Meyer carried it to Arner, explain. 
ing that it had been impossible to execute his commands to 
the letter, owing to the absence of the beadle. 
‘“‘Why did you not take one of the overseers in his 
place?” inquired Arner. 
‘No one was willing to come.” 
‘‘Did you tell them it was a matter of moment to me, 
and would no one then consent to aid you?” 
‘© No, Sir; all that I could say was in vain.” 
‘¢Then carry this list back, and read every man’s state- 
ment to him aloud, in the presence of two of the overseers ; 
let these sign as witnesses, and then bring the document 
back to me, before the village meeting begins.” 
The peasants were not at all pleased with the idea of rati- 
fying their statements in the presence of witnesses; but 
they yielded to necessity, and returned the document wit- 
nessed in due form. When Arner received it, he bade 
Meyer take the beadle, and with Michael and the poulterer 
as assistants, go immediately from house to house, and 
make out a fresh list, measuring the hay and counting the 
cattle with care and precision. He caused the bells to be 
rung to assemble the meeting, ‘‘ for,” he said, ‘‘ I would 
rather the proprietors should not be at home during the 
counting and measuring; and should any of the wives or 
servants oppose your entrance, let Flink arrest them, and 
bring them here.” Arner then placed a guard at all the 
entrances to the square, and ordered the watchmen on no 
pretext to allow any one to depart until the meeting was 
over.

CHAPTER XX. 
A CURIOUS ASSEMBLY. 
THE community had soon assembled near the linden-tree ; 
but never in the annals of Bonnal had the peasants con- 
ducted themselves so strangely. Many who had always 
stepped proudly crept along like old crones, hanging their 
heads; former enemies stood side by side, and whispered 
confidentially together ; people whose tongues had been wont 
to wag from sunrise to sunset were silent as the grave; men 
who had always donned their Sunday clothes before going 
to the village meeting appeared now in working trousers and 
overalls. Most of them sat there as if at a loss what to say, 
and many a man asked his neighbor two or three times if he 
did not think it would rain before night. But some of the 
overseers, who noticed the universal panic, put a bold face 
on the matter, and began to talk as if to show they were not 
afraid. Finally old Triimpi, who had never in his life been 
known to arrive anywhere in season, appeared with the in- 
telligence that the Bailiff and the beadle were walking down 
toward the village, in company with Michael and the poul- 
terer, and were carrying with them paper, ink and pens. 
This news spread like wildfire through all the benches, 
carrying consternation with it. It was but a few moments 
before one man discovered he had forgotten his handker- 
chief, a second, that his tobacco had been left behind, while 
a third found it imperatively necessary to speak with his 
wife a minute, and a fourth remembered he had left some- 
thing out which might be stolen; one even had the nose-
-P-A-G-E-116
106 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
bleed, —in short, a large number of peasants started at once 
on the homeward road. But the watchman ordered them 
back, counselling them to borrow tobacco and handkerchiefs 
from their neighbors, and to stanch the nose-bleed this time 
at the fountain under the linden-tree. 
They accordingly returned to the benches, and the next 
moment their anxiety was increased by the command that 
the overseers and landed proprietors, seventeen in number, 
should go immediately to Arner at the parsonage. In some 
trepidation they obeyed the summons, but it was in vain that 
the nobleman tried to induce them to a voluntary confession. 
He had hardly done speaking when Kalberleder burst out: 
‘We understand neither your words nor your accusation!” 
‘« Who are the ‘ we’ in whose name you speak?” returned 
Arner. 
‘‘Oh, nobody, —I speak only in my own name.” 
‘No, Kalberleder, you have come to an agreement before- 
hand, and that is why the ‘ we’ slipped out. But you ask 
what my charge is? Then hear it: you have embezzled the 
public property, tampered with the public accounts, and 
shown yourselves faithless and perjured with respect to 
everything which came into your hands!” 
This was certainly explicit, and much worse than they 
had expected. They looked at each other a while in silence. 
Then one of them plucked up courage to demand a judicial 
investigation, and the others followed his lead, protesting 
their innocence. 
‘Tt is enough!” said Arner. ‘‘ From this moment you are 
prisoners. You will now return with a guard to your places 
in the meeting, but are forbidden to exchange a word with 
any one. Away!” 
A deadly silence fell upon the assembly as the seventeen 
men entered under guard. Arner followed, and bade the rest 
of the people be seated, while the culprits stood before him.
-P-A-G-E-117
  LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 107 
He then ordered the clerk to read aloud the list of articles 
which had been stolen from the Castle by the prisoners. 
He read: ‘‘In the stable of Judge Kienast are two wheels 
which were stolen from the Castle; Kalberleder’s wheel- 
barrow was stolen from the Castle,” etc. Sixteen of the 
seventeen men were implicated in the charges, and they 
stood there, terrified and confused, not heeding Arner’s 
admonition, joined to the exhortations of their friends, that 
they should confess their guilt. But the honest old Renold, 
who had long watched the evil practices of his colleagues 
with a heavy heart, stood forth pale and trembling, and thus 
spoke: ‘Sire, I am an old gray-headed man, and God 
knows that I have never had any pleasure in the wickedness 
prevailing among us; but your charges are quite true.” 
‘¢Old man,” Arner replied ; ‘‘ your gray hairs fill me with 
compassion. I well know that you have only erred in keeping 
silence regarding the evil practices of the rest, and it grieves 
me that you have been associated with people who refuse to 
acknowledge their manifest guilt.” He turned angrily to the 
others as he spoke, but their spirit was at last broken, and 
sinking on their knees, they begged for mercy. 
At this moment, the men who had been sent to the village 
to measure the hay and count the cattle, appeared with their 
new list. Arner compared it carefully with the previous 
one, and found that twenty-two peasants had made false 
statements regarding their possessions, including the whole 
sixteen who were on their knees before him. He caused the 
other six to be summoned from their places, and four at 
once presented themselves. The sacrist and the school- 
master, however, lingered. They were no landed pro- 
prietors, properly speaking, but had made fraudulent state- 
ments about their trifling belongings, aping the wealthy 
peasants out of sheer pride. 
‘¢ Are these two not here?” inquired Arner.
-P-A-G-E-118
  108 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
‘Indeed they are!” cried out some of the men from the 
furthermost benches. 
‘Who says we are not?” said the sacrist, advancing to 
the front with the schoolmaster, and making a reverence in 
due form. Then with folded hands and sanctimoniously 
upturned eyes, he began: ‘‘ Ah, gracious Sir, I have not a 
handful of fodder except what comes from the poor little 
churchyard; and I had the misfortune to miscalculate in 
regard to the petty bit of hay.” 
‘¢ What was the amount of your mistake?” asked Arner, 
after eying him searchingly for a few moments. 
‘¢One cord.” 
‘¢ And how much fodder did you get from your church- 
yard?” 
‘* They say now it is two cords.” 
‘¢ Indeed? But I suppose what they say is true?” 
‘¢ Well — yes.” 
*¢ And how much did you state you had?” 
*¢ One cord.” 
‘¢Of all the rascals here, I doubt if there is one who has 
made a mistake of half the whole amount, as you have 
done!” 
The sacrist being silenced, the schoolmaster now begged 
permission to say a word, and proceeded to declare that one 
of his two cows had been taken from his barn a few days 
ago, without his knowledge. ‘‘I am very sorry,” he added, 
“but I quite forgot that the butcher of Rebstal had come 
after her.” 
“ You must suffer from a poor memory,” remarked Arner. 
“Yes, Sir, for some time past; and then my wife takes 
more care of the barn; I am busy with the school.” 
‘* Then you ought to have let your wife make the state- 
ment about the number of the cattle; or you ought to have 
gone into the barn to see whether you had two cows or 
one.”
-P-A-G-E-119
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 109 
The cattle-dealer Stoffel here arose and said : ‘‘ But, indeed, 
gracious Sir, I am quite innocent, for I am expecting the 
cattle every day which I mentioned.” 
‘¢ Nobody asked you how many you were expecting, but 
how many you had,” returned Arner. 
‘« That is true, Sir; but as I was expecting the cattle every 
hour, I had to take account of them for the pasturage.” 
“‘'You said there were eight more than you really have, 
did you not?” 
‘* Your Grace is right.” 
‘¢ From whom did you purchase them?” 
‘* They are coming from different places.” 
‘* When do you expect them?” 
«In three days at latest.” 
“All eight?” 
“ Quite certainly.” 
‘* Your plea is in order, if it is true.” 
Here four others arose with a similar story, and finally the 
schoolmaster hopped up, declaring that he was also expecting 
a cow, for he had only exchanged his for another. Then 
Arner said: ‘* Neighbors, you must not forget that you were 
all convicted of dishonesty and deceit, even before your cattle 
or your hay were thought of ; and you will find it quite natural 
that I should take measures to convince myself that you are 
speaking the truth. You will remain here in the Castle three 
days, until your cattle arrive.” 
An awful silence ensued. ‘‘ What is the matter?” in- 
quired Arner. 
For a moment there was no reply, and then Stoffel faltered : 
‘* My — my purchases are not yet quite in order.” 
“¢ Did you not just say that all eight of your cattle would 
certainly come by the day after to-morrow?” 
“Yes, if I can go home, I am sure they will.” 
‘* But if you stay, seven will surely come?” 
   
-P-A-G-E-120
  110 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
No answer. 
‘* Look here, if only six come, I will be satisfied.” 
Again there was no reply. 
“¢ Well, surely three or four will come, at least?” 
* All eight, if I can send word.” 
‘¢ What sort of word?” 
‘That they shall be sent to me.” 
‘¢ And without this message not a single one will come?” 
‘© No, I don’t suppose there will.”’ 
“¢ Neither do I, nor have I thought so at all, any more than 
I believe that the schoolmaster has exchanged his cow with 
the butcher.” And Arner proceeded to talk seriously to all 
those present about the evils of deceit and lying.
-P-A-G-E-121
  
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 111 
CHAPTER XXI. 
ARNER METES OUT JUSTICE, AND A DYING WOMAN ASKS 
FORGIVENESS. 
AtrracteD by a sound of loud talking from the benches, 
Arner perceived that the peasants were beginning to express 
their condemnation of the poor malefactors kneeling before 
him. ‘I wish I could believe,” he said, ‘‘ that those of you 
who are sitting on the benches were better than these men in 
front; but I know only too well that there is hardly a house 
in the village which does not contain many articles belonging 
to the Castle, and that some of you are even sitting here 
before me in coats that are lined with grain-bags from my 
store-house.” 
The words had hardly left his lips before Hartknopf laid 
his coat tightly together over his knees, and grew red as 
fire. His conduct was so remarkable that it drew the atten- 
tion of his neighbors, who turned over the lappets of his 
coat to inspect the lining. Such a burst of laughter arose 
that Arner inquired the cause. 
‘¢Hartknopf has the Castle mark on his coat-lining!” 
shouted one man. 
‘“<T bought this lining ten years ago!” cried Hartknopf in 
a rage. 
‘¢ But this is the brand of the new sacks, which are under 
five years old!” exclaimed another. 
“Tf I were you,” said Arner, ‘‘ I would restore quiet to 
the assembly by carrying my coat home.” And with this 
suggestion the old hypocrite was forced to comply. 
   
-P-A-G-E-122
  112 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
Arner commanded the beadle to seat twelve of the poorest 
old men in the parish in the places of the overseers, and 
compelled the twenty-two to kneel down before them and 
publicly beg for pardon. The clerk read aloud the false 
and correct statement of each man regarding his cattle and 
hay, and he was obliged to acknowledge the truth in the pres- 
ence of the whole community. Arner then dismissed the 
assembly until afternoon. 
At the second session he brought up his project about the 
division of the common, showing the peasants that by em- 
ploying the abundant springs he had discovered to irrigate 
their land, a large part of the pasture-ground might be con- 
verted into excellent meadow-land, so that each member of * 
the community could derive an income of three or four hun- 
dred florins from his portion. Just as the inhabitants of 
Bonnal were beginning to exchange their fear of their master 
for something approaching confidence, the poulterer of Arn- 
heim appeared, with complaints regarding his recent treat- 
ment in the village. Arner noticed that many of the peasants 
looked ashamed, and some of them said aloud: ‘‘ The poul- 
terer’s sorceries will soon be forgotten, since the meadow is 
divided !” 
Without heeding these remarks, the nobleman said gravely : 
‘¢ Every one of you may believe what he pleases, but I must 
prevent you from wronging others in consequence of your 
belief. If any man hasa complaint against the poulterer, let 
him come forward and state it, and I will see that justice is 
done.” But no one spoke. Arner went on: ‘‘ Your silence 
does not satisfy me. I could have thought some of the 
accused here before me might feel moved to confess that 
this treatment of the poulterer was all a plot to prevent the 
division of the common.” 
The overseers looked at each other, and Renold besought 
them to make the required confession. For the first time in 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
  
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 113 
their lives, they followed his advice ; and thus the affair with 
the poulterer was finally ended 
While they were still sitting beneath the linden-tree, the 
pastor’s servant came to say that the Bailiff’s wife was con- 
vinced she had been poisoned by Treufaug’s medicines, and 
petitioned that her husband might be allowed to come to her 
before she died. The benevolent look faded from Arner’s 
face, and in a terrible voice, which had never been heard 
from him before, he commanded the beadle to go to the house 
of the so-called physician, and bring him hither without de- 
lay. The beadle, who was no friend to the quack doctor, 
soon returned with the intelligence that Treufaug, standing 
at the window in his wig, had sent word that he was lying 
sick in bed and could not come. ‘‘ Well, then,” said Arner 
with a bitter laugh, ‘‘ bring the man to me on a litter, that 
the journey may not harm him.” Dozens of the younger 
men sprang at once to do his bidding. 
Now after the beadle’s departure, Treufaug’s mind was 
ill at ease, and taking his old spy-glass from the wall, he 
levelled it upon the public square below. He could see the 
sarcastic expression of Arner’s face, and it made him trem- 
ble. Presently he observed that the nobleman was sur- 
rounded by a number of people with litters, and felt reiis- 
sured, thinking that something else must be on foot. He 
had just returned from the cellar with a bottle of wine, with 
which he proposed to revive himself after his fright, when he 
heard a loud knocking at the door, and looking from the 
window, beheld a litter surrounded by a large crowd. All 
resistance and protestations were in vain; he was obliged to 
place himself upon the mattress, and allow himself to be 
covered with the upper feather-bed, and thus was carried in 
triumph through the village. 
When the litter was set down under the linden-tree, and 
the indignant physician, springing from the bed, began to

protest against the treatment he had received, r uncontrol- 
lable laughter broke out among the people, and even Arner 
himself could hardly command a sober face, Presently, 
however, the nobleman restrained his mirth, and said seri- 
ously: ‘‘I have previously forbidden you to use your hang- 
man’s drops; but I now reyoke that command. Use them 
on as many people as are willing to be killed by you; but if 
anybody dies on your hands, you must make his grave. And 
since you are old and short of breath, so that you can hardly 
bear the labor of digging, you can lend some day-laborer 
your gray coat with the many buttons, and your black wig ; 
then you shall sit by and look on, while he digs the grave in 
your stead.” With this sentence he dismissed) the offender, 
and the meeting soon after came to an end. 
The good pastor hastened to the Bailiff’s dying wife, and 
sat awhile silent beside her, attentive to her evéry want, and 
with a face full of tender compassion. Presently she seemed 
to suffer less pain, and he ventured to express ajwish already 
hovering on her lips, that she would see all the poor people 
whom she and her husband had wronged, and ask their for- 
giveness before her death. From her bedside the good man 
went to see Treufaug, and partly by the threat of a post 
mortem examination, but still more by kindly persuasion and 
exhortation, he induced the misguided doctor to admit that 
he had no sure knowledge of the power and) effect of his 
drugs, and obtained from him the promise that he would 
never use them again on his own responsibility. 
Early the next morning, the poor people ass¢mbled at the 
door of the dying woman. She was already awake, and it 
was Gertrude’s gentle hand which smoothed her pillow and 
wiped the sweat from her brow. The pastor went out and 
told the assembled men, women and children} nearly forty 
in number, to come in as quietly as possible. 
drew off their heavy wooden shoes, and entering |the sick-room

on tiptoe, they all answered the silent greeting of their 
hostess with a friendly nod, and sat down noiselessly on the 
chairs and benches which Gertrude had arranged for them. 
The Bailiff’s wife addressed her visitors, thanking them for 
complying with her request, and begging their forgiveness 
for all the evil they had suffered at her hands. She closed 
with a petition that all would utter a prayer for the welfare 
of her soul, and sank back unconscious on her pillow. The 
pastor fell on his knees and prayed silently, while the eyes 
of all present were filled with tears of pity and forgiveness. 
Then at a sign from the clergyman, they silently withdrew 
from the chamber of death.

CHAPTER XXII. 
PLANS OF REGENERATION IN BONNAL. 
As the Sunday approached when Arner had decreed that 
Hummel should be exposed to the view of the whole congre- 
gation, while the pastor held up his previous life as a warn- 
ing to those present, the prisoner expressed the utmost horror 
of this penalty, declaring that he would rather have his pun- 
ishment at the gallows repeated, than stand under the pulpit 
to be the laughing-stock of the town. He represented that 
such a ceremony could neither dispose him to thoughts of 
repentance, nor have a beneficial effect upon the spectators. 
The pastor was finally so moved by his entreaties, as well as 
convinced of the reasonableness of his plea, that he inter- 
ceded with Arner, and induced him to remit the sentence.! 
Accordingly, the clergyman merely took Hummel’s life as a 
text, preaching a stirring sermon against the wickedness and 
corruption which had been fostered so long in their midst, 
and which were still rife, in almost equal measure, in the 
hearts of many of his listeners. 
This discourse everywhere made a profound impression ; 
the peasants could talk of nothing else on the way home, and 
Arner, pressing the good pastor’s hand, thanked him heartily 
for his edifying words. He expressed, at the same time, an 
earnest desire to labor for the improvement of the village. 
1 In the earlier editions of this work, the original plan of the 
Bailiff’s punishment was adhered to. Itis a sign of advancing civili- 
zation that in the edition of 1819 Arner’s sentence was revoked as 
above.
-P-A-G-E-127
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 117 
and asked the clergyman if he could recommend an upright, 
able man from among the people, who could help him in 
furthering his designs. The parson mentioned at once the 
spinner known as Cotton Meyer, and proposed they should 
visit him and his sister that afternoon. They were accom- 
panied by the Lieutenant Gliilphi, one of Arner’s aids in 
regulating the economic conditions of his government. 
Cotton Meyer was sitting at his door with a child in his 
lap, when the three gentlemen approached, and had no sus- 
picion that they were seeking him, until they paused before 
his garden gate. Then he went to meet them with so calm 
and dignified a bearing that Gliilphi did not give him his 
hand, as he usually did to the peasants, and Arner addressed 
him less familiarly than was his wont when speaking to his 
dependants. 
The visitors were about to seat themselves on the bench 
under the apple-tree; but Meyer led them into the parlor, 
where his sister was sitting by the table, nodding over the 
open Bible, as was her custom on Sunday afternoons. She 
started up with a cry as the door opened, and straightening 
her cap, closed the Bible; then, taking a sponge, she mois- 
tened it in a tin hand-basin which shone like silver, and 
erased the chalk figures with which her brother had covered 
the table, despite the remonstrance of the strangers, who 
feared that Meyer might have further use for his reckoning. 
After wiping the table carefully, she brought a large fine 
linen table-cloth, and laid new tin plates, with knives, forks 
and heavy silver spoons upon it. 
‘‘What are you doing?” inquired her guests; ‘‘ we have 
already dined.” 
‘<I suppose so,” answered Maria; ‘‘but since you have 
come into a peasant’s house, you must take kindly to our 
peasant ways.’ Running into the kitchen, she returned with 
two plates of little cakes and a fine large ham, and Arner,
-P-A-G-E-128
118 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
Gliilphi and the pastor seated themselves good-naturedly 
before the shining dishes. 
When the visitors began to praise the house, the garden 
and the whole establishment, Maria remarked that twenty 
years ago they had been among the poorest in the village. 
‘¢T know it,” said Arner, ‘‘ and I wonder at your prosperity 
the more, as the weavers and spinners have usually turned 
out the most good-for-nothing people in the country.” 
Meyer was forced to admit that this was true, but denied 
that the cause lay in the industry itself. The trouble was, 
he said, that these poor people were not in the habit of laying 
up anything from their earnings, and led wretched, aimless 
lives. He felt sure that Arner might find many ways of 
winning the hearts of the people, so as to lead them into 
better paths, and suggested, as one expedient, that he should 
promise to every child, which up to its twentieth year should 
annually lay aside ten florins from its earnings, a field free 
from tithes. ‘‘ But,” went on Meyer, “after all, we can do 
very little with the people, unless the next generation is to 
have a very different training from that our schools furnish. 
The school ought really to stand in the closest connection 
with the life of the home, instead of, as now, in strong con- 
tradiction to it.’ 
Gliilphi joined in the conversation with eagerness, and 
argued that a true school should develop to the fullest extent 
all the faculties of the child’s nature. The question next 
arose, how such a school could be established in Bonnal. 
Cotton Meyer, when appealed to, rejoined: ‘‘I know a 
spinning-woman in the village who understands it far better 
than I”; and he went on to tell the others such things of 
Gertrude’s little school and its effects upon her children, that 
they resolved to visit her and examine her method for them- 
selves. They also spoke of the corruption prevailing in the 
village, and discussed the best method of choosing a good

bailiff. Cotton Meyer showed himself through it all a man 
of such clear judgment and practical common sense, that his 
guests left him with a feeling of respect almost approaching 
veneration.

CHAPTER XXIII. 
MUCH APPREHENSION AND ONE PEACEFUL HOME. 
Arter the morning service, Arner had given orders to the 
beadle to announce in the village that on the following 
Thursday the common would be divided, and on Friday 
every one who was in Hummel’s debt must settle accounts 
with him under the linden-tree. All Bonnal was panic- 
stricken at this news, and the good impression made by the 
sermon vanished as quickly as it had come. As Cotton 
Meyer’s sister walked along the street, she saw groups of 
frightened-looking spinning-girls putting their heads together, 
and when she addressed them, the greater number cast down 
their eyes and made no answer. After a while, one or two 
ventured to stammer that they owed money to Hummel, and 
must go under the linden on Friday; then, gaining courage, 
many of them seized her hands, imploring her to intercede 
for them with their parents, who knew nothing of their 
debts. 
But it was by no means the children alone who looked 
forward with apprehension to the day of reckoning; the 
parents were in many cases in a similar situation. One 
woman had pawned a garment which her husband missed 
from the wash; another had carried a cloak to Hummel, and 
then asserted that a beggar had stolen it. Most pathetic of 
all was the despair of the so-called ‘‘ Pious Barbara,” who 
was so overcome with the shame in store for her, that she 
privately resolved to send a poor woman of the same name 
in her place on Friday.
-P-A-G-E-131
  LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 121 
Gertrude’s house was again almost the only one in the vil- 
lage which was undisturbed by dark forebodings. The 
parents spoke together with joyful emotion of the morning’s 
sermon, and Gertrude read several chapters aloud from the 
Bible, beside singing a hymn with the children. After the 
afternoon service, the whole family gathered about the hearth, 
for it had grown chilly. As they sat there, Gertrude said 
with tears in her eyes: ‘‘ Our single aim, after all, is that 
we may be all together in eternity as we are now.” 
Leonard rejoined: ‘‘Our being so together on earth, 
as we now are, will surely lead to our being together in 
heaven.” 
And little Harry cried: ‘‘ Yes, how beautiful it is to sit so 
around the hearth! Say, mother, don’t people grow good, 
when they sit together so, and talk of God, and pray and 
sing?” The domestic hearth was sacred to the ancients, 
but it is doubtful whether any one has ever made a better 
eulogy upon it than our little friend Harry. 
It seemed, in truth, as if that humble fireside grew daily 
more blessed. Everybody had thought that, as soon as 
Leonard found it possible to earn money, he would fall back 
into his old ways. But it was not so. He rose early, 
cleaned out the stall, milked the cow, and did many things 
he had previously left to his wife, and went off merrily to his 
work, with the children’s morning hymn ringing in his ears. 
When he reached the churchyard, to be sure, his cheerful 
mood would usually vanish, for although the apprentices 
were tolerably faithful, most of the day-laborers were lazy 
and good-for-nothing, and made their master much trouble. 
Still, his home joys compensated for all the annoyances 
which befell him. In the evening he helped his oldest son 
to build a Tower of Babel, such as was pictured in his 
grandmother’s Bible, out of a heap of clay; and taught him 
to calculate the amount of lime and stone and sand necessary 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  122 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
to construct a given length of wall. One day he bought 
Nicholas a mason’s hod and apron, and no prince was ever 
prouder at the first wearing of his crown, than the mason’s 
boy, when he donned the implements of his future calling. 
Usually, when Leonard came home, he found Rudy’s chil- 
dren in the house. They came every day to learn to spin, 
and the love and patience with which Gertrude bore with 
these disorderly and untrained little ones, was almost past 
belief. Their eyes were often anywhere but on their yarn, 
so that this would now be too thick, and now too thin. 
When they had spoiled it, they would watch for a moment 
when Gertrude was not looking, and throw it out of the 
window by the handful, until they found that she discovered 
the trick when she weighed their work at night. Rudy’s 
children all declared at the outset that spinning was very 
difficult, but Leonard’s little Harry laughed at them, and 
once, when his mother was not in the room, he bade one of 
the others bind his eyes; then, seating himself at the wheel, 
he spun away as briskly as before. ‘‘ We wouldn’t have 
believed it! ’’ cried Rudy’s children in astonishment. 
“¢Oh, what you can’t do blindfold, you can’t do at all!” 
remarked Master Harry. 
‘Learn to spin first with the use of your eyes,” said 
Gertrude laughing, as she entered the room and learned 
what had transpired. And it was not long before all the 
children, except the oldest girl, were completely accustomed 
to the order which reigned in the mason’s household. 
Gertrude’s kindness to Rudy was not limited to his chil- 
dren. Not a day passed that she did not go to his house 
and see that everything about the premises was in order; if 
it was not, she took hold herself to remedy the defect, which 
so put the good man to shame that he used to run about and 
examine every nook and corner, before the hour of her 
accustomed visit. Rudy also took more pains about his
-P-A-G-E-133
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 128 
tlothes and person, and whitewashed his smoky little room, 
beside decorating it with prints of the Crucifixion, the 
Madonna and Child, St. Nepomuk, the Emperor Joseph II., 
the King of Prussia, and a black and white hussar, all of 
which he bought for the purpose at the village fair. Gertrude 
told the children they must not put their fingers on the beau- 
tiful pictures, else these would grow black. But this injunc- 
tion was not pleasing to the little boys, and Master Rudy 
cried out: ‘¢ There’s somebody you can’t forbid making them 
black!” 
‘¢Who is that?” asked his father. 
‘“‘The flies. You know they made our mother’s great 
cross and Jacob’s Ladder so black that we couldn’t read a 
word on them!”
-P-A-G-E-134
  124 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
CHAPTER XXIV. 
‘WOMAN’S ARTIFICE AGAINST WOMAN. 
Tue more Gertrude visited Rudy, and occupied herself 
with his children, the more she became convinced that the 
present state of things could not last forever. ‘‘He must 
have another wife!” she exclaimed ; and taking counsel with 
herself, she could think of no one in the village better fitted 
for him than the sister of the Bailiff Meyer. One day, while 
she was at Rudy’s house, she chanced to see the object 
of her designs coming up the street, and running to the 
window, she called out good day to her. Meyer’s sister 
returned the greeting, and asked: ‘‘ Are you at home in that 
house?” 
‘* For the present, but only till some better person takes 
my place. — But do come in, and see what good order Rudy’s 
house is in.” 
Nothing loath, her friend sprang up stairs at a bound, and 
was filled with admiration at the new arrangement of the 
room. Gertrude led her out to the stable to see the beauti- 
ful cow which Arner had given Rudy. ‘I never saw a finer 
one!” exclaimed the unsuspecting visitor; and stroking the 
creature, she added: ‘‘It must be a pleasure to milk such a 
cow as that.” 
‘¢ Would you like to milk such a one?” asked Gertrude 
archly. 
“Indeed I would!” 
‘¢ But you have two fine ones at home” — and the mason’s 
wife turned away to conceal a smile.
-P-A-G-E-135
  LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 123 
«¢They are nothing at all in comparison with this one,” 
said her friend innocently, giving the cow a handful of 
fodder. 
Then Gertrude led the way past the long row of fruit- 
trees, bending beneath their heavy burden, and over the 
thickest grass of Rudy’s beautiful meadow. Meyer’s sister 
praised everything, and presently asked where the children 
were. ‘They, too, are quite different from what they were 
once,” said Gertrude ; ‘‘ I will show them to you.” 
‘s And is their father, too, different?” 
“That heis! Why, you would hardly know him, with his 
hair and beard and clothes all in order.” 
“¢That will be a good thing, if he ever wants to marry 
again,” said the visitor, still unsuspicious. 
With this they went back into the house, whither the 
children had just returned. Gertrude took little Rudy by 
the hand, and smoothed back the golden curls which hung 
down over the broad white forehead; the boy leaned back 
upon her arm, and gazed with great blue eyes at the stranger. 
Nanny was a delicate child, but so beautiful with her deep- 
set, flashing eyes, and raven hair fine and smooth as silk, 
that the visitor exclaimed of her own accord: ‘‘ This one is 
an angel!” 
** And Lizzie will be a fine girl some day, I trust,” said 
Gertrude of the oldest. 
‘¢ She hasn’t so happy a face as the others,” remarked her 
friend ; and Gertrude gave the girl a significant look. 
The children were all sitting at their new spinning-wheels, 
and little Rudy placed himself with his behind the stove. 
When the mason’s wife called him out to show his yarn, he 
was so elated at their praise that he sprang across the room 
to the window, with a loud laugh of glee.. ‘“‘ That is a wild 
one!” said Meyer’s sister. 
‘« Not so very,” replied Gertrude, calling the child to her.
-P-A-G-E-136
  
126 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
“Stand still, now; you know it makes dust in the room 
when you jump about so.” 
‘“<T forgot,” said the boy, standing quiet as a lamb by her 
side. 
Then Gertrude went into the adjoining room, and return- 
ing with the baby, put it into her friend’s arms. It had just 
waked, and had the rosy flush of a healthy baby after sleep. 
It rubbed its eyes and shook itself upon the arm of the 
visitor, who caressed and played with it so lovingly that it 
grew confiding, and reached after her mouth with its tiny 
hand. She caught one small finger between her lips, which 
amused the child, and when it succeeded in freeing itself, it 
shook with laughter. In the midst of this frolic Gertrude 
said: ‘‘If the poor little chick could only have another 
mother !”” 
Like a flash Meyer’s sister saw the game her friend had 
been playing, and was vexed with herself for not having 
discovered it sooner. She passed the baby back to Ger- 
trude, saying she must go home immediately. ‘‘ But don’t 
you think,’’ persisted the mason’s wife, ‘‘ that these good 
children are in need of a mother?” 
“Who says they are not?” 
‘¢There are certainly no children in the village who need 
one more.” 
‘¢ There I disagree with you. There are perhaps none in 
the whole village who need a mother less.” 
‘How can you joke about such a thing?’’ cried Ger- 
trude. 
“T am not joking in the least. You take the place of 
seven mothers.” And turning to the children, she asked : 
*‘Tell me, now; wouldn’t you rather have this kind woman 
than a new mother?” 
‘“‘That we would!” they shouted; ‘‘ rather than a hun- 
dred new mothers !”
-P-A-G-E-137
  LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 127 
“‘You are making a stupid piece of work of it!” ex. 
claimed Gertrude in vexation. 
‘¢ You were trying to make too wise a one, I imagine.” 
‘¢ What do you mean?” 
** As if you didn’t know!” 
‘¢ Well, I do think that in Rudy’s present circumstances 
he can look for a wife where he will.” 
‘* Certainly no one will want to prevent him,’’ observed 
Meyer’s sister with a smile. 
‘You say that so sarcastically !” 
‘¢ Shall I tell you why? It amuses me that you are such 
a partial advocate of his. You seem to fancy that any 
woman would stretch out both hands to be step-mother to 
seven children.” 
“‘T would like to find a mother, not a step-mother for 
them.’” 
‘‘Most women would think twice before taking such 9 
step; seven children are always seven children.” 
‘* At least, most of them are good children.”’ 
‘“* That may be.” 
** And he is goodness itself.” 
‘*T thought that was coming next!” 
‘¢Tt is true, at all events.” 
‘¢ And then I suppose he is a fine young man!” 
‘*T didn’t say so.” 
‘¢ Tt’s a wonder you didn’t!” 
‘But he does certainly appear younger” — 
** Than he did six weeks ago.” 
*¢ You have noticed it, then?” 
“TY think I must be going home,” was the tet only 
gesponse. 
“ Just wait a moment! ” 
“ Not a half a one!” 
‘** But you really must not go away from the children with. 
out a friendly leave-taking,” said Gertrude.

The other turned, and gave the desired salutation. ‘‘ Did 
you hear?” she asked, laughing; ‘‘I said ‘God be with 
you!’ to them.” 
‘* And when you come again, you will say ‘God greet 
you!’” 
‘‘ When I come again, perhaps I will!” returned Meyer’s 
sister, hastening out of the house. Her face was scarlet, 
and her step very different from that with which she had 
come. Gertrude followed her with her eyes, and felt that 
the first move in the game had not been without fair pros- 
pect of success.
-P-A-G-E-139

CHAPTER XXV. 
GERTRUDE’S METHOD OF INSTRUCTION. 
Tr was quite early in the morning when Arner, Gliilphi and 
the pastor went to the mason’s cottage. The room was not 
in order when they entered, for the family had just finished 
breakfast, and the dirty plates and spoons still lay upon the 
table. Gertrude was at first somewhat disconcerted, but the 
visitors reissured her, saying kindly: ‘‘This is as it should 
be; it is impossible to clear the table before breakfast is 
eaten!” 
The children all helped wash the dishes, and ther seated 
themselves ‘in their customary places before their work. 
The gentlemen begged Gertrude to let everything go on as 
usual, and after the first half hour, during which she was a 
little embarrassed, all proceeded as if no stranger were 
present. First the children sang their morning hymns, and 
then Gertrude read a chapter of the Bible aloud, which they 
repeated after her while they were spinning, rehearsing the 
most instructive passages until they knew them by heart. 
In the mean time, the oldest girl had been making the chil- 
dren’s beds in the adjoining room, and the visitors noticed 
through the open door that she silently repeated what the 
others were reciting. When this task was completed, she 
went into the garden and returned with vegetables for din- 
ner, which she cleaned while repeating Bible-verses with the 
rest. 
It was something new for the children to see three gentle- 
men in the room, and they often looked up from their spin-
-P-A-G-E-140
  130 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
ning toward the corner where the strangers sat. Gertrude 
noticed this, and said to them: ‘‘Seems to me you look 
more at these gentlemen than at your yarn.” But Harry 
answered: ‘¢ No, indeed! We are working hard, and you'll 
have finer yarn to-day than usual.” 
Whenever Gertrude saw that anything was amiss with the 
wheels or cotton, she rose from her work, and put it in 
order. ' The smallest children, who were not old enough to 
spin, picked over the cotton for carding, with a skill which 
excited the admiration of the visitors. 
~. Although Gertrude thus exerted herself to develop very 
early the manual dexterity of her children, she was in no 
haste for them to learn to read and write. But she took 
pains to teach them early how to speak; for, as she said, 
‘“‘of what use is it for a person to be able to read and write, 
if he cannot speak ?—since reading and writing are only an 
artificial sort of speech.” To this end she used to make the 
children pronounce syllables after her in regular succession, 
taking them from an old A-B-C book she had. This exercise 
in correct and distinct articulation was, however, only a sub- 
ordinate object in her whole scheme of education, which 
embraced a true comprehension of life itself. Yet she never 
adopted the tone of instructor toward her children; she did 
not say to them: ‘‘ Child, this is your head, your nose, your 
hand, your finger ;” or: ‘‘ Where is your eye, your ear?” — 
but instead, she would say: ‘‘ Come here, child, I will wash 
your little hands,” ‘‘ I will comb your hair,” or: ‘‘I will cut 
your finger-nails.” Her verbal instruction seemed to vanish 
in the spirit of her real activity, in which it always had its 
source. The result of her system was that each child was 
skilful, intelligent and active to the full extent that its ag/s 
and development allowed. 
.. The instruction she gave them in the rudiments of arith+ 
metic was intimately connected with the realities of life. She 
taught them to count the number of steps from one end of 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 131 
the room to the other, and two of the rows of five panes 
each, in one of the windows, gave her an opportunity to un- 
fold the decimal relations of numbers. She also made them 
count their threads while spinning, and the number of turns 
on the reel, when they wound the yarn into skeins. Above 
all, in every occupation of life she taught them an accurate 
and intelligent observation of common objects and the forces 
of nature. : 
All that Gertrude’s children knew, they knew so thoroughly 
that they were able to teach it to the younger ones ; and this 
they often begged permission to do. On this day, while the 
visitors were present, Jonas sat with each arm around the 
neck of a smaller child, and made the little ones pronounce 
the syllables of the A-B-C book after him ; while Lizzie placed 
herself with her wheel between two of the others, and while 
all three spun, taught them the words of a hymn with the 
utmost patience. 
‘When the guests took their departure, they told Gertrude 
they would come again on the morrow. ‘‘ Why?” she re- 
turned ; ‘‘ You will only see the same thing over again.” 
But Gliilphi said: ‘‘ That is the best praise you could possi- 
bly give yourself.” Gertrude blushed at this compliment, 
and stood confused when the gentlemen kindly pressed her 
hand in taking leave. 
The three could not sufficiently admire what they had seen 
at the mason’s house, and Gltilphi was so overcome by the 
powerful impression made upon him, that he longed to be 
alone and seek counsel of his own thoughts. He hastened 
to his room, and as he crossed the threshold, the words broke 
from his lips: ‘‘ J must be schoolmaster in Bonnal!” All 
night visions of Gertrude’s schoolroom floated through his 
mind, and he only fell asleep toward morning. Before his 
eyes were fairly open, he murmured: ‘‘I will be schoolmas- 
ter!” —and hastened to Arner to acquaint him with his 
resolution.
-P-A-G-E-142

CHAPTER XXVI. 
MATOH-MAKING AND SCHOOL-MAKING. 
ARNER rejoiced greatly over Gliilphi’s determination, and 
calling for the good pastor on their way, the two friends 
turned their steps for the second time to Gertrude’s door. 
She had expected them, but had made no change in her usual 
programme. As they entered, at the close of the Bible 
reading, the morning sun shone brightly into the room, and 
the children, of their own accord, struck up the song begin- 
ning : 
“With what a fair and radiant gleam 
The sun’s mild rays upon us beam, 
Bringing refreshment to the eye, 
And filling all our souls with joy!” 
When they were all seated at their work, little Harry 
whispered in his mother’s ear, to ask if the children might 
not thank Arner for the money he had given them, and on 
receiving permission, he noiselessly crept about between the 
wheels, bearing the message to his brothers and sisters. The 
little band came forth and stood shyly before the nobleman, 
no one daring to speak, until at a question from Arner, Harry 
plucked up courage to stammer out their errand. Arner 
lifted the boy kindly upon his knee, where he was soon as 
much at home as if it had been his own father. 
Rudy’s children now held a consultation, and came forward, 
black-eyed Nanny ahead, to thank their benefactor for the 
cow and the meadow. Arner set Harry down and took the 
little girl in his lap, where she was soon as much at her ease
-P-A-G-E-143
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE 133 
as the boy had been. In a minute she asked: ‘‘ Have you 
much more of that beautiful money you gave the other chil- 
dren?” 
‘¢ For shame!” cried all the rest in chorus. 
‘« No, let her speak,” said Arner. ‘* Would you like some 
too?” 
“Yes, if you please.” 
‘¢ But I have none with me at present.” 
‘Don’t you always have it with you?” 
‘No, but I shall have some when I come again.” 
During this scene it seemed to Gertrude as if somebody 
were urging her to say a word of her plan about Meyer’s 
sister; yet her courage failed her when it came to the point 
of speaking. Just then the Bailiff Meyer happened to come 
in with a message to Arner, and as he was leaving, Gertrude 
forced herself to say, with a glance at the child in the noble- 
man’s arms: ‘‘If the little chick could only have another 
mother!” 
Arner replied that he should suppose it would not be diffi- 
cult for Rudy to find a wife in his present circumstances. 
“Yes, but” — stammered Gertrude, —‘‘but he ought to 
have a good one.” 
‘*¢ Pick one out for him, then.” 
‘‘T would be very glad to do so, if it lay in my power; 
but the Bailiff could do the most, if he would only have the 
kindness to say a good word to his sister for Rudy.” 
Meyer, who, with his wife, had far different plans in view, 
turned pale. ‘‘You hear what she says,” remarked Arner 
to him. ‘‘ What have you to say? Would you object to 
him as a brother-in-law?” 
‘Oh, — by no means,” stammered the hypocritical Bailiff. 
‘* Well, then, tell your sister that it would greatly rejoice 
me, if she would decide to enter this household.” 
‘¢Oh, yes, Sir, yes indeed,’’ answered the poor wretch, 
still pale as death.
-P-A-G-E-144
134 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
‘‘But you need not feel constrained to do this on my 
account, if you have any objection,” added Arner, suspect- 
ing that Meyer’s inclinations were on the other side, and 
wishing to leave him a loophole of escape. But he made 
fresh assurances of his good will in the matter, and left the 
house very ill at ease. 
Gliilphi had been waiting impatiently to speak to Gertrude 
of his own plans, and he now asked her whether she thought 
it would be possible to introduce into a regular school the 
same method she pursued at home with her children. ‘‘I 
am not sure,” she replied ; ‘‘ although I am inclined to think 
that what is possible with ten children would be possible 
with forty. But it would be difficult to find a schoolmaster 
who would tolerate such an arrangement in his school.” 
“But supposing one could be found,” said the lieuten- 
ant, ‘‘ who would be willing to introduce it, would you help 
him?” 
‘<To be sure, —7f one could be found,” she returned with 
a laugh. 
* And if I were he?” 
““Were who ?”? 
‘The man who is ready to establish such a school as you 
have in your room.” 
** You are no schoolmaster !’’ 
“But I will be.” 
‘Yes, in some great city, perhaps, and in things village 
people know nothing about! ” 
‘No, in a village, and in things all village people ought 
to understand.” 
‘¢That must be a queer sort of village, where a gentleman 
like you wants to be schoolmaster! Such a gentleman as 
you doesn’t take a fancy to teach children like these here.” 
‘¢That you don’t know.” 
** But I have an idea that it is so.”
-P-A-G-E-145
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 136 
“So I perceive. But if I really wanted to be such a 
schoolmaster, what then? Would you help me?” 
‘To be sure,” said Gertrude again, still under the impres- 
sion he was joking ; ‘‘I will help you all I can.” 
Gliilphi turned to Arner and the pastor, saying: ‘‘ You 
have heard, she has promised twice to help me.” 
‘* That’s fine!” they said laughing. 
Gertrude began to be confused, and when she found they 
were actually in earnest, she stoutly declared herself incapa- 
ble of showing the lieutenant the least thing in the world, 
although she would gladly send her children to school to 
him, and come herself if she were only younger. But they 
answered that her help would be indispensable, and when 
she pleaded her lack of time and the cares of her household, 
and named another excellent housekeeper whose aid might 
be of service, Gliilphi replied: ‘*‘She will doubtless be 
useful, too, but there can be no substitute for your mother’s 
heart, which I must have for my school.” 
‘* My mother’s heart is hardly large enough for my own 
room,” said Gertrude; ‘‘and if you are really to be our 
schoolmaster, I know you will bring a father’s heart and a 
father’s strength into the work, such as will make my little 
mother’s heart quite superfluous.” 
“Tt is very true,” retharked the other gentlemen, ‘that 
our lieutenant will bring a great father’s heart with him; 
but that will not render the codperation of your mother’s 
heart unnecessary.” Then they explained to her that they 
regarded the proper education of the youthful population 
as the only means of elevating the condition of the corrupt 
village; and full of emotion, Gertrude promised them she 
would do anything in her power to forward the good cause.

CHAPTER XXVII. 
A SINGULAR COURTSHIP. 
Tur Bailiff Meyer hastened home with rage in his heart, 
having conceived the idea that his sister was in league with 
Gertrude, and had taken this method to further her designs. 
When, toward evening, he finally succeeded in finding his 
sister, he accosted her with an irritation for which she was 
at a loss to account, until he mentioned Gertrude’s name. 
She turned very red, but he did not notice it, and proceeded 
to describe the interview at the mason’s cottage. After a 
pause, she inquired: ‘* What answer did you give them?” 
‘*You can readily imagine I had to promise them what 
they asked.” 
“‘That you would speak a good word for Rudy?” 
“¢T was obliged to.” 
“Indeed? But how is it now? What do you advise me?” 
‘* You surely do not ask me in earnest! You know very 
well that my wife and I had other plans for you.” 
‘“‘T know; it was only yesterday you were speaking of it. 
But then I cannot understand your promising Arner some- 
thing different.” 
‘¢ Don’t quarrel with me now! JI am in a sufficiently tight 
place already.” 
“You well may be, if that is the way you behave! I 
wouldn’t look a living being in the face, if I had acted as 
you have done!” —and she ran off in great excitement to 
the mason’s house. 
Gertrude endured the passionate reproaches of her friend
-P-A-G-E-147
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 187 
in silence, until the latter had become somewhat calmer, and 
then volunteered to give her a true version of the affair. 
When Meyer’s sister heard what feelings had actuated Ger- 
trude, and learned that Arner had expressed the most friendly 
interest in Rudy’s future wife and his whole household, her 
anger was turned against her brother alone, and her speech 
grew quiet. At this juncture Rudy came out from behind 
the door, where he had been an unintentional auditor of the 
conversation. When the visitor arrived, he was with Ger- 
trude, and had followed her down stairs, with the intention 
of begging Meyer’s sister not to be angry with Gertrude for 
her friendly intervention in his behalf; but, checked by the 
loud tones of the excited guest, he had drawn back and 
waited for an opportunity to address her. 
Meyer’s sister started back at Rudy’s unexpected appear- 
ance, and measured her suitor from head to foot. Strange 
to say, as he stood before her, cap in hand, with a bearing 
which plainly showed that he had no hope, and was not there 
on his own account, — he pleased her so well that she stood 
still, and no longer scanned him with a critical eye. He, 
however, not noting this favorable change, begged her to 
pardon him for venturing to think of her, adding that he was 
in sore need of an excellent wife. She answered: ‘*I can 
give you no hope.” 
He did not reply, but stood looking wistfully at her, like a 
hungry man who is yet loath to ask analms. ‘‘ Fie!” she 
cried ; ‘‘ you stand there like a beggar.” 
‘*T have never begged in my life, and yet I imagine that 
now I do stand before you as you say.” 
‘¢ But you should not!”” 
‘¢ How am I to stand before you, then, and what shall J 
do instead of begging?” 
‘* You must pay no heed to me at all.” 
‘¢Then I would rather go on begging.”
-P-A-G-E-148
  138 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
‘¢ Well — then I must say ‘God help you.’” 
“<Tf you will say that to me in the right way, I shall have 
no objection.” 
‘¢ Well, then — God help you, Rudy!” 
‘Oh, that is not the right sort of ‘God help you.’” 
‘¢ What would you call the right sort?” 
“Tf you would give me your hand on it, and promise you 
would help me, too, that would be the right sort of ‘God help 
you.’” 
‘‘ Indeed? You are certainly no fool, Rudy.” 
‘¢ Perhaps not; but, indeed, it would be hard to find any- 
body who has equal need of such an alms.”” 
‘¢ But why should J be the one to give it to you? You can 
beg in this way at many houses.” 
‘¢ That I shall not do.” 
‘¢ Well, do as you please! Only now go behind the door 
again, and leave us alone.’’ With this she took Gertrude’s 
arm, and walked away, at a loss what to say next. 
Gertrude praised Rudy and his household, and Meyer’s 
sister took leave in a very different frame of mind from that 
in which she had come. Arrived at home, she seemed to see 
Rudy perpetually before her eyes, and hear his words in her 
ear. The rich cousin whom the Bailiff and his wife had. 
intended for her husband also appeared to stand before her ; 
first, as she saw him at his sister’s wedding, eating bacon, 
with the fat dripping from the corners of his mouth; and 
then, as she had seen him that other time in the village, 
when he was slaughtering a sow, and thrust his hand far into 
the animal’s neck, until the warm blood gushed over it. She 
mentally contrasted the two men, and said to herself: ‘‘ Yes, 
if I had to take one of them, it would certainly be the good 
old Rudy ; but it must be neither of the two.”

CHAPTER XXVIII. 
HOW SLANDER IS PUNISHED AND THE COMMON DIVIDED. 
Arter his visit to Gertrude’s school, Arner sat down and 
wrote a long letter to his intimate friend Bylifsky, now min- 
ister of the Duke, describing the impression made upon him 
by what he had just seen, and stating the views of Cotton 
Meyer with regard to the means of bettering the condition of 
the corrupt village. ‘‘ These views,” he concluded, ‘‘ can be 
summed up under the following heads : 
“~~. 1. A school shall be organized which can be brought into 
harmony with the developing influence of domestic life, as is 
\_the case with that in Gertrude’s house. Soh 
2. The better portion of the people of Bonnal shall unite 
with the Castle and the parsonage, for the purpose of gain- 
ing a sure and active influence over the various households 
of the village. 
3. A new method of choosing the overseers shall be 
adopted, whereby the evil influence exerted by bad overseers 
may in future be removed.” 
It had been announced that on the following day the 
apportionment of the common would be concluded. Arner 
was setting out for the village in the morning, when he was 
told that a peasant’s daughter of the Eichenberger family 
wished to speak with him. Arner had been overrun with 
visits from the villagers ever since his kindly reception of 
Gertrude, when she came to him in her trouble. He had 
believed at first that it was his duty to grant a personal inter- 
view to any of his dependants who should see fit to seek him 
eee
-P-A-G-E-150
140 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
at tht Castle; but lately he had come to the conclusion that 
his time was being wasted in listening to much useless 
gossip, while he was even forced sometimes to lend an ear to 
falsehood and slander. A few days ago, he had resolved to 
make an example of the first person who should abuse his 
patience in this way; and the opportunity now presented 
itself. 
He knew Eichenberger’s daughter by reputation ; she was 
one of those daughters of semi-rich peasants, who, through 
the vanity and ignorance of their parents, are sent away te 
third-rate boarding-houses in small towns, where they learn 
to ape the customs and manners of city life. The maiden 
in question had been still further led astray by her acquaint- 
ance with Sylvia, an unscrupulous court demoiselle who was 
related to Arner. Sylvia hated her cousin Arner, and was 
particularly anxious to learn anything occurring to his dis- 
credit in Bonnal, that she might hold him up to ridicule in 
the higher circles of society. With this laudable design, she 
employed the above-mentioned peasant’s daughter as her 
newsmonger, allowing her vain informant the felicity of sit- 
ting by her side on the sofa during their confidential inter- 
views. 
Now LEichenberger’s daughter had heard of Arner’s 
friendly behavior toward Gertrude and Cotton Meyer, and 
imagined she might easily rise even higher than they in his 
favor; so adorning herself as if to attend a wedding, she 
hired the best cart she could obtain, and drove to Arnheim. 
Arner admitted her into his audience-chamber, and resolved 
to let her speak uninterruptedly. She began in all confi- 
dence, lamenting the bad manners and morals of Bonnal, 
and in her strictures sparing no one, not even Gertrude and 
Cotton Meyer. Arner listened attentively, but remained 
silent. By degrees this conduct confused her, so that she 
began to contradict herself. But the more involved her 
ae
-P-A-G-E-151
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 141 
speech became, the more sharply Arner looked at her, still 
in this awful silence. She lost courage, and changing her 
tactics, modified and retracted her previous statements, until 
amid increasing embarrassment she hesitated and stopped. 
Arner at length opened his lips and said: ‘‘ Have you 
finished?” She could not speak, but gazed at him with 
fixed eyes and quivering lips. He rang, and his armed 
servant entered. Arner ordered the man to conduct her 
back to Bonnal in the eyes of all the world, so that another 
time she might have the wisdom to remain at home, instead 
of running to the Castle to slander the best people in the 
village. 
Speechless with terror, she threw herself on her knees. 
It was fortunate for her that Arner’s wife Theresa hap- 
pened to pass the open door at this moment, and asked the 
meaning of the scene. When she learned the truth, she 
laughingly prevailed upon Arner to allow his suppliant to 
withdraw without an escort. Eichenberger’s daughter did 
not wait for a second bidding, but flew home as fast as her 
feet would carry her, and wrote Sylvia a glowing account of 
the whole affair. 
Arner proceeded to the village, where the people were 
assembled in the square under the linden-tree. After the 
lots were drawn, entitling the peasants to their respective 
shares in the common, he left the men to themselves, and 
stood watching them curiously. He remembered an old 
saying of his grandfather, that the distribution of property 
shows what people are, the possession of it makes them 
what they are. Every superior portion drew forth manifes- 
tations of avarice, which were exhibited in as many different 
ways as there were individuals. But this was only one side 
of the matter. Arner soon found that he could learn more 
of agriculture from these peasants, as they discussed the 
good and bad points of a piece of land, than he had ever 
ae.
-P-A-G-E-152
142 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
known before. The pleasantest thing of all was now and 
then to see the delight of a poor man, when he had drawn 
a good lot; but the rich peasants wore discontented faces. 
In the afternoon, Arner summoned the people again to the 
common, and for a different purpose. A little before the 
appointed time, a wagon loaded with several hundred fruit- 
trees from Arner’s own nursery-garden, moved from the par- 
sonage, where it had been stationed awaiting his orders, 
toward the linden-tree ; and at the same time a large herd of 
goats was seen advancing in the same direction. 
‘When Arner reached the green, he announced that every 
father might go to the wagon, and take as many fruit-trees 
as he had children. At this word the rich, the greedy and 
the bold pressed forward to snatch the best for themselves. 
But Arner ordered them to stand back, and wait until all the 
trees should be taken from the wagon and laid upon the 
ground; then they might advance, one by one, and take 
them in the order in which they lay. 
After this was done, he called the people about him, and 
said: ‘‘ I am anxious that even the poorest household in the 
village shall not be without milk for the young children, so I 
have had these goats brought here, and will be glad to ad- 
vance the money to those who are not able to buy one for 
their children.” 
He begged those who would like such a loan, to come for- 
ward, and twenty-seven answered the summons. They were 
hatless, shoeless and in rags, and worse than that, loafer, 
fighter, gambler and drunkard was written on their faces. 
Arner was heart-sick, and could not help exclaiming: ‘¢ You 
are a wretched-looking set indeed! And the worst of it is, 
that neither land nor milk will help you!” He paused, then 
in a moment continued: ‘If it were not for your children, 
I would send the goats back where they came from. — But 
go, in God’s name, and pick them out!” 
   
-P-A-G-E-153
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 143 
\ The children whose fathers bought the goats were so over- 
joyed that many children of rich parents persuaded their 
fathers to buy them goats also, saying that Arner’s little 
Karl had one. After warning the children not to form idle 
habits while herding their goats, Arner talked with the 
fathers about the tithe-free fields he wanted to promise to 
those spinners’ children who would save up eight or ten 
florins from their earnings before their twentieth year. The 
wealthy peasants began to put their heads together, and 
murmur: ‘*‘ What will our own daughters have, if these 
spinners’ children are to have tithe-free fields?” Arner 
heard it, and offered the same reward to any peasant’s 
daughter whose parents should receive an orphan child into 
their house, and bring it up faithfully and well. But the 
\tch men turned away grumbling.

CHAPTER XXIX. 
A DAY OF JUDGMENT. 
Ir was the night before the day on which all accounts were 
to be settled between the former Bailiff Hummel and his 
debtors, and Arner could not sleep for thinking of the 
wretched crowd he would be compelled to face on the mor- 
row. Little Karl, who slept in the room with him, heard him 
groan, and asked: ‘‘ Is anything the matter, papa, that you 
can’t sleep?” 
‘‘ No, my dear boy,” Arner replied. 
“But, dear papa, I know something is the matter; you 
are anxious about to-morrow.” 
‘¢ How do you mean, my boy?” 
‘¢Papa, do you suppose I don’t know that everybody is 
anxious about the reckoning to-morrow? ” 
‘* Who told you so?” 
‘¢ Oh, a number of the boys; but one in particular. Just 
think, papa, he was with the other boys, but he hadn’t the 
heart to play like the rest, so I went up to him, and asked 
him why he looked so sad. At first he wouldn’t tell me, but 
I gave him no peace until at last he said that his family at 
home, his father and mother and sisters, were almost erying 
their eyes out, because they owed the Bailiff something; and 
to-morrow his sister must come to you under the linden. 
Then he began to cry so hard that he ran and hid behind a 
hedge, so that no one should see him.” 
‘¢ What is his name, and to what family does he belong?” 
‘¢ His name is Jamie, and he is such a pretty boy!—so
-P-A-G-E-155
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 145 
good and gentle, too! You won’t be hard on them to-mor. 
row, will you, papa?” 
‘¢T don’t intend to be hard on anybody, but, my dear Karl, 
you know as well as I do that when a bad habit is formed, 
it must be broken up.” 5 
“‘Yes, papa. But if they don’t do so any more, you'll be 
good to them again?” 
‘¢T shall be only too glad,” answered his father; and with 
this word little Karl straightway fell asleep. 
In obedience to the beadle’s summons, by nine o’clock all 
Hummel’s debtors had gathered under the linden-tree, a sorry 
assemblage of men, women and children, from the old toper 
who had sat for the last twenty years at the Bailiff’s table, 
to the misguided child who a few weeks ago had entered 
the tavern for the first time. As Arner sat with a sad face 
beside the pastor, he suddenly remembered the conversation 
of the previous night, and inquired about the family to which 
Karl’s friend belonged. The parson spoke of them in the 
highest terms, as honest, industrious people. The wife had 
been confined to her bed all winter, and her husband had 
been obliged to watch with her night after night, without 
proper nourishment, which had led him, from time to time, 
to send for wine as a stimulant. His daughter, who had 
brought the wine, had never touched a drop of it herself, but 
insisted on coming to the linden in place of her father. 
Arner’s heart was filled with compassion for this unhappy 
family, and for a while it seemed to him as if he could better 
endure the sight before him. He pitied the children most, 
and called them up first, to put them out of their misery. 
He usually said only: ‘‘ Are you there, too?” To some, 
however, he gave his hand, saying: ‘* Don’t do so again, ay 
long as you live!” 
Most of the women seemed ready to sink to the ground 
with shame and terror; but he could see that the greater 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
146 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
part of this was put on, and treated them accordingly. 
When Lindenberger’s daughter, Jamie’s sister, was called, 
she did not raise her eyes from the ground, but silently laid 
the money on the table. Arner spoke kindly to her, saying 
he knew her history, and how she was not at all to blame, 
but had taken the disgrace upon herself to spare her father. 
The girl covered her overflowing eyes with her hand, as she 
sobbed out: ‘‘ My father, nobody but my dear father can 
have told you this!” 
‘*No,” said Arner; ‘‘it was your brother Jamie who told 
it to my Karl, and he begged me with tears in his eyes not 
to be hard on you. Tell your brother, my girl, to come to 
the Castle on Sunday to see Karl; he is very fond of him.” 
She sprang away home with tears of joy. 
Others, who had witnessed Arner’s kindness, tried to 
abuse it by exciting undeserved sympathy in their favor; 
but in vain, Finally the name of ‘‘ Barbara” was called, 
and the poor spinning-woman answering to that appellation 
stepped forward. There was a movement of surprise among 
all present, of which Arner inquired the cause. The beadle, 
who was well aware of the truth, replied with a grin that 
they thought it was not the right Barbara. Hummel, being 
questioned, said that the Barbara who was in debt to him 
went by the name of ‘the pious,” and that her pride had 
probably prevented her from coming to answer the summons 
in person. ‘* And how much did she give you,” inquired 
Arner of the other Barbara, ‘‘ for coming in her place?” 
‘A half florin,” she answered, adding that she had not 
thought it would do anybody any harm if she consented. 
‘¢ But did you not think of its injuring your reputation to 
come before this table?” 
‘*T thought nobody would believe it!” was the reply, to 
the amusement of all. 
Arner sent his man-at-arms to bring the rightful Barbera, 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 14T 
whom he found solacing this bitter hour of affliction by read- 
ing the book of Job. All prayers and protestations were 
unavailing ; the proud woman was obliged to accompany the 
soldier back to the linden, —if you wish to know how, good 
reader, you must recall to your mind the ‘‘ Dance of Death” 
in Basle. Arner made the second Barbara sit down on the 
stone bench beside the first, aud wait until all the other 
ne’er-do-weels had concluded their reckoning ; then he called 
her before him, and simply said she must give her namesake 
another half florin for the service she had renderéd, and 
another time must not try to purchase immunity from dis- 
grace so cheaply.

CHAPTER XXX. 
THE YOUNGER GENERATION BRINGS HOPE AND COMFORT TO 
THE PEOPLE'S FATHER. 
Tuis same morming a portion of the village was very dif- 
ferently employed. The spinners’ children had resolved on 
the previous day to form a procession and go to Arner, 
to thank him for his kindness. They rose bright and 
early, and devoted an unusual amount of time to the duties 
of the toilet, washing themselves zealously at brook and 
well, and allowing their tangled hair to be combed without 
a murmur. They put on the best clothes their homes 
afforded, which in many cases were only soiled rags, and 
gathered at the houses of Gertrude, Cotton Meyer’s sister, 
and young Renold’s wife. These three women, who had 
encouraged the children in their undertaking, borrowed 
shoes, stockings, dresses and wearing apparel of every sort, 
that the procession might be a pretty one. 
When the whole band had finally assembled at Maria’s 
house, she said: ‘‘ We have forgotten to choose a queen for 
the procession, and teach her a speech to say to Arner.” 
All three women looked the children over, and almost in 
one breath cried: ‘*I know the one!” It proved they 
had all selected the same child, a poorly dressed girl, yet 
beautiful as the day, with golden hair rolling back from her 
fair forehead, and great blue eyes fixed upon the ground. 
She was standing a little apart from the others, aLsorbed in 
thought, and quite unconscious of the attention she excited. 
She was the oldest of the ten children of an unhappy man,
-P-A-G-E-159
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 149 
who, having fallen into Hummel’s clutches, went into the 
woods one night, and hung himself. From that hour the 
child had never for a moment forgotten her father. During 
the day, she was the servant of her sick mother, and the 
mother of her younger brothers and sisters, performing every 
duty faithfully and uncomplainingly. But at midnight, when 
all the household were in their beds, a little figure would 
creep forth into the thicket to a lonely grave, which lay 
between rocks and lofty trees on the edge of a precipice. 
Round about it the child had planted the fairest wild flowers, 
~—pblue violets, pale greenish tulips, snowy anemones and 
delicate pink roses, with a great sunflower in the middle, 
and passion-flowers at the fcur corners. She had surrounded 
the grave with hedges woven of thorns, to keep off the wild 
beasts, and no human foot but hers ever visited the spot. 
This was the girl who stood apart from the merry band, 
and did not even hear that she was chosen queen of the pro- 
cession. When the children pressed around her, and rejoiced 
that she was to be their queen, her eyes filled with tears, 
for since her father’s death she had lost faith in the kindness 
of her fellow-mortals. Renold’s wife took her by the hand, 
saying: ‘‘Come, now, I will dress you like a bride, and 
teach you a speech.” 
The good woman attired her charge in a white dress of 
fine fabric, and was about to adorn her forehead with the 
shining band which the peasant-girls wear to weddings and 
baptisms, when the child drew back, and begged her to con- 
sider what Arner and the whole village would say if she 
should appear in such finery. ‘‘ Let me answer for that!” 
Renold’s wife replied ; ‘‘ you must wear it for Arner and the 
procession, not for your own sake.” 
The child submitted, and suffered herself to be placed at

the shepherd’s hand, and with as little personal vanity a¢

might be displayed by a baby arrayed in cloth of gold, 
and placed upon a throne to be gazed at by an admiring 
multitude. 
Arner had returned to the parsonage from the linden sick 
at heart, and almost discouraged at the idea of ever being 
able to elevate or improve a people which had sunk to such 
a depth of corruption. He walked up and down in the gar- 
den, a prey to gloomy thoughts, and at length seated him- 
self in a dark arbor, which seemed to correspond to his 
frame of mind. Suddenly he was aroused from his musings 
by the sound of children’s footsteps, and looking up, he 
beheld a youthful procession, extending throughout the 
entire garden, as if it had no end, and at its head, right 
before him, an angel in a snow-white robe, who thus 
addressed him : 
‘‘Dear Father Arner: we are the poor spinners’ children 
of Bonnal, and have come to thank you for being so good 
to us, and promising us so great a gift if we lay up our earn- 
ings regularly. We also thank you heartily, because you 
are going to establish a school among us in which we shall 
be able to learn more than we ever had a chance to do 
before. All this makes us very happy, and we promise that 
while we are young, and when we grow old, we will do right, 
and show ourselves worthy of your benefits. May God 
requite you, in time and eternity, for what you do for us!” 
The effect of this scene upon Arner was indescribable. 
He hardly knew for a moment whether he were dreaming or 
awake, and could not move hand or foot. Then he took the 
. snowy angel by the hand, and asked: ‘‘ Whose child are 
you?” 
But his voice was hard, and his glance confused; his 
words also terrified the good child, who, pale and trembling, 
began: ‘‘ My father” — but she could not go on, and coy- 
ered her face with both hands.
-P-A-G-E-161
  
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 151 
“What is it?” asked Arner, almost as much startled as 
the girl herself. Another child that stood near, whispered : 
‘¢ She is the daughter of the unfortunate Rickenberger.”’ 
Arner was much grieved. He took her hand, and said: 
“Tam sorry I asked you that. But it is to your credit that 
you are so fond of your father; I know he deserved your 
love, and was a good father to you.” 
With the little hand still in his, Arner gradually recovered 
from the first shock of surprise, and rejoiced at the coming 
of the children. The remembrance of their parents, who 
had stood before him that morning, faded from his mind, 
and he saw only the younger generation, for which hope 
arose in his soul. He felt himself the father of these little 
ones, and seating himself among them on the turf, he played 
with them as if they were indeed his children. The pastor’s 
wife made a delicious milk-soup for the little company, and 
Arner’s son Karl, as well as the parson and the lieutenant, 
came and enjoyed it with them. Their delight reached its 
height when Theresa arrived with the other children, and all 
sat together at the rustic banquet in joy and harmony.

CHAPTER XXXI. 
THE ORGANIZATION OF A NEW SCHOOL. 
Gtitpar was full of the idea of his school, and could 
speak of nothing else with Arner and the pastor. He used 
all his spare time in visiting Gertrude, in order to talk it 
over with her; but she seemed quite unable to explain her 
method in words, and usually deprecated the idea of her 
advice being necessary. Occasionally, however, she would 
let drop some significant remark which the lieutenant felt 
went to the root of tle whole matter of education. For 
example, she said to him one day ‘VF You should do for your 
’ children what their parents fail to do for them. The read- 
ing, writing and arithmetic are not, after all, what they most 
need ; it is all well and good for them to learn something, 
but the really important thing is for them to be something, 
—for them to become what they are meant to be, and in 
becoming which they so often have no guidance or help at 
home.” 
Finally, the day arrived on which the new schoolmaster 
was to be formally presented to the village. Arner and the 
pastor led him solemnly between them to the church, which 
was crowded with the inhabitants of Bonnal. The good 
clergyman preached a sermon on the ideal function of the 
school in its relation to the home, and to the moral develop- 
ment of the community; after which Arner led Gliilphi 
forward to the railing of the choir, and introducing him to 
the people, made a short but earnest plea in his behalf. 
The lieutenant was much affected, but mastered his emotion
-P-A-G-E-163
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 153 
safficiently to express in a few words his sense of the respon- 
sibility conferred upon him, and his hope that the parents 
would codperate with him in his undertaking. 
Arner was anxious to make the occasion of Gliilphi’s 
installation a festival for the school-children, so after the 
services at the church, he invited all the little folks to the 
parsonage, where, with the help of the pastor’s wife, prepa- 
rations had been made to receive them. It was a time- 
honored custom that every year, at Christmas and Easter, 
eggs and rolls should be distributed among the children of 
Bonnal. On this day, on entering the parsonage, the young 
people beheld even more beautifully painted eggs than they 
had seen at Easter; and beside each child’s portion lay a 
bright nosegay. 
The lieutenant, who knew nothing of the whole matter, 
was in an adjoining room, when suddenly the door was 
thrown open, and the children, at a sign from Theresa, 
struck up with one accord their prettiest song, and Gliilphi 
found himself surrounded by the lively throng of his future 
charges. He was much moved, and when the song was con- 
cluded, he greeted them kindly, shaking many of them by 
the hand, and chatting pleasantly with them. Arner ordered 
some of his own wine to be brought, and the children drank 
the health of their new schoolmaster. 
On the following morning the lieutenant began his school, 
and Gertrude helped him in the arrangement of it. They 
examined the children with regard to their previous studies, 
and seated those together who were equally advanced. First 
there were those who had not learned their letters, then those 
who could read separate words, and finally, those who already 
knew how to read. Beside reading, all were to learn writing 
and arithmetic, which previously had only been taught to the 
more wealthy, in private lessons. 
At first Gltilphi found it harder than he had expected;  
-P-A-G-E-164
  154 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
but every day, as he gained in experience, his task became 
easier and more delightful. A good and capable woman, 
named Margaret, who came to take charge of the sewing, 
spinning etc., proved a most valuable and conscientious 
helper in the work. Whenever a child’s hand or wheel 
stopped, she would step up and restore things to their former 
condition. If the children’s hair was in disorder, she would 
braid it up while they studied and worked; if there was a 
hole in their clothes, she would take a needle and thread, 
and mend it; and she showed them how to fasten their shoes 
and stockings properly, beside many other things they did 
not understand. 
The new master was anxious, above all, to accustom his 
charges to strict order, and thus lead them to the true wis- 
dom of life. He began school punctually on the stroke of 
the clock, and did not allow any one to come in late. He 
also laid great stress on good habits and behavior. The 
children were obliged to come to school clean in person and 
apparel, and with their hair combed. While standing, sitting, 
writing and working, they always were taught to keep the 
body erect as a candle. Gliilphi’s schoolroom must be clean 
as a church, and he would not suffer a pane of glass to be 
missing from the window, or a nail to be driven crooked in 
the floor. Still less did he allow the children to throw the 
smallest thing upon the floor, or to eat while they were study- 
ing; and it was even arranged that in getting up and sitting 
down they should not hit against each other. 
Before school began, the children came up to their teacher 
one by one, and said: ‘‘God be with you!” He looked 
them over from head to foot, so that they knew by his eye if 
anything was wrong. If this glance was not sufficient, he 
spoke to them, or sent a message to their parents. A child 
would not infrequently come home with the word: ‘‘ The 
schoolmaster sends greeting, and wants to know whether you
-P-A-G-E-165
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 155 
have no needles and thread,” or ‘‘ whether water is dear,” 
etc. At the close of school, those who had done well went 
up to him first, and said: ‘‘ God be with you!” He held 
out his hand to each one, replying: ‘‘ God be with you, my 
dear child!” Then came those who had only done partly 
well, and to these he merely said: ‘‘God be with you!” 
without giving them his hand. Finally, those who had not 
done well at all had to leave the room without even going to 
him. 
The lieutenant’s punishments were designed to remedy the 
faults for which they were inflicted. An idle scholar was - 
made to cut fire-wood, or to carry stones for the wall which 
some of the older boys were constructing under the master’s 
charge; a forgetful child was made school-messenger, and 
for several days was obliged to take charge of all the teach- 
er’s business in the village. Disobedience and impertinence 
he punished by not speaking publicly to the child in question 
for a number of days, talking with him only in private, after 
school. Wickedness and lying were punished with the rod, 
and any child thus chastised was not allowed to play with 
the others for a whole week; his name was registered in a 
special record-book of offences, from which it was not erased 
until plain evidence of improvement was given. The school- 
master was kind to the children while punishing them, talk- 
ing with them more then than at any other time, and trying 
to help them correct their faults.

CHAPTER XXXII. 
A GOOD PASTOR AND SCHOOLMASTER ; THE OPENING OF A NEW 
ERA. 
In his instruction, Gliilphi constantly sought to lay the 
foundation of that equanimity and repose which man can 
possess in all circumstances of life, provided the hardships 
of his lot haye early become a second nature to him. The 
success of this attempt soon\ convinced the pastor that all 
verbal instruction, in so far as it aims at true human wisdom, 
and at the highest goal of this wisdom, true religion, ought 
to be subordinated to a constant training in practical domes- 
tic labor. The good man, at the same time, became aware 
that a single word of the lieutenant’s could accomplish more 
than hours of his preaching. With true humility, he profited 
by the superior wisdom of the schoolmaster, and remodelled 
his method of religious instruction. He united his efforts to 
those of Gltilphi and Margaret(striving to lead the children, 
without many words, to a quiet, industrious life, and thus to 
lay the foundations of a silent worship of God and love of 
humanity.\ To this end, he connected every word of his 
brief religious teachings with their actual, every-day experi- 
ence, so that when he spoke of God and eternity, it seemed 
to them as if he were speaking of father and mother, house 
and home, in short, of the things with which they were most 
familiar. He pointed out to them in their books the few 
wise and pious passages which he still desired them to learn 
by heart, and completely ignored all questions involving doc- 
trinal differences. He no longer allowed the children to
-P-A-G-E-167
    LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 157 
learn any long prayers by rote, saying that this was contrary 
to the spirit of Christianity, and the express injunctions of 
their Saviour. 
The lieutenant often declared that the pastor was quite 
unable to make a lasting impression on men, because he 
spoiled them by his kindness. Gliilphi’s own principles in 
regard to education were very strict, and were founded on 
an accurate knowledge of the world. He maintained that 
love was only useful in the education of men when in con- 
junction with fear; for they must learn to root out thorns 
and thistles, which they never do of their own accord, but 
only under compulsion, and in consequence of training. 
He knew his children better in eight days than their parents 
did in eight years, and employed this knowledge to render de- 
ception difficult, and to keep their hearts open before his eyes. 
He cared for their heads as he did for their hearts, demanding 
that whatever entered them should be plain and clear as the 
silent moon in the sky. To insure this, he taught them to 
see and hear with accuracy, and cultivated their powers of 
attention. Above all, he sought to give them a thorough 
training in arithmetic ; for he was convinced that arithmetic 
is the natural safeguard against error in the pursuit of truth. 
Despite the children’s rapid progress in their school, the 
lieutenant did not please everybody in the village, and a 
rumor soon spread abroad that he was too proud for a 
schoolmaster. It was in vain that the children contradicted 
this report; their parents only answered: ‘‘ Even if he is 
good to you, he may be proud all the same.” It was not 
until three weeks after the beginning of the school, that an 
event occurred which accomplished for him what the chil- 
dren’s defence had been unable to do. 
For the last twenty years the old rotten foot-bridge oppo- 
site the schoolhouse had been out of repair, so that in a 
rainy season the children must get wet above their ankles in
-P-A-G-E-168
| 
158 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
crossing the lane to school. The first time the road was in 
this condition, Gliilphi planted himself in the middle of the 
street in all the rain, and as the children came, lifted them, 
one after the other, across the brook. Now it happened that 
some of the yery persons who had complained most of the 
lieutenant’s pride, lived just across the way. It amused 
them greatly to see him get wet through and through in his 
red coat, and they fancied it would not be many minutes 
before he would: call to them for help. When, however, he 
kept on patiently lifting the children over, until his hair and 
~ Clothes were dripping wet, they began to say behind the 
window-panes: ‘‘He must be a good-natured fool, and we 
were certainly mistaken; if he were proud, he would have 
given it up long ago.” Finally, they came out, and offered 
to relieve him from his task, while he went home and dried 
himself. But this was not all; when school was out that 
day, the children found a foot-bridge built, over which they 
“ould go home dry-shod. And from that day forth, not a 
word more was heard of the schoolmaster’s pride. 
The school was still not without enemies, the bitterest 
among them being the old schoolmaster, whose envy and 
rage at its success would have known no bounds, had he not 
feared to lose the pension which had been granted him by 
Arner, on condition that he should not set himself against 
the new order of things. But the schoolmaster was not the 
only man in the village who looked back with regret to 
bygone days. Half of the villagers had been accustomed 
to spend their evenings at the tavern, and the bitterest 
complaints were heard on all sides, because, after the affair 
with Hummel, Arner had caused this house to be closed. 
As soon as he learned the state of things, and found that 
many of the former loafers were making their homes misera- 
ble by their idle discontent, Arner opened the peat swamps 
in the vicinity of Bonnal, and at once supplied more than 
fifty men with good employment.  
-P-A-G-E-169
  LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 159 
The condition of the poor people of the village was much 
improved in various ways. The prospect of tithe-free land 
brought order and thrift into the houses of many of the 
spinners, and the poor in general were no longer so servile 
in their obedience to the whims and exactions of the rich. 
Renold’s wife, who had always been noted for her charity, 
began to see that more good could be done by leading the 
people to help themselves, than by all her alms-giving; and 
now, whenever her aid was asked, her first answer was: ‘I 
must go home with you, and see what you really need, and 
how I can best help you.” 
Every evening the lieutenant had a half dozen young 
people at his house, to whom he talked for hours of what 
Arner and the pastor intended, and showed how their 
designs had been misunderstood. Among his hearers was 
one young man, Lindenberger by name, who seemed to com- 
prehend it all at a single word, and whose clear and forcible 
language served to set things in their true light before many 
of the villagers. 
It was only the old generation, who were hardened in vice, 
for whom the new era that was opening contained no pros- 
pect of anything better. The quack doctor Treufaug, who 
had promised the parson to abstain from his evil practices, 
could not resolve to leave his old life and lead a good and 
useful one; the former Bailiff Hummel, when freed from the 
pressure which had been brought to bear upon him in the 
‘ime of his great humiliation, and deprived of his daily inter- 
course with the pastor, fell back into his old ways, so far 
as his changed circumstances would allow ; and Hartknopf, 
after a brief season of repentance, became the same canting 
hypocrite as ever.

CHAPTER XXXII. 
A DISTURBING ELEMENT AND AN EXCITING ADVENTURE. 
One day Arner received a letter from his uncle, the Gen- 
eral von Arnburg, announcing that he was coming, with his 
niece Sylvia, to visit his nephew for a few weeks. This 
Sylvia, who has already been mentioned in connection with 
Eichenberger’s daughter as an enemy of Arner, had been 
brought up by the general’s bounty after her father’s death. 
She was headstrong and arrogant by nature, and these faults 
of disposition had not been corrected by her education, but 
merely covered with a veneer of social polish. She hated 
Arner, both for his philanthropic principles, and because he 
was heir to her uncle’s property. In her ambition for wealth 
and distinction, she tried to induce Helidorus, the favorite 
minister of the Duke, to procure her a rich and titled husband, 
as well as to influence the general to disinherit Arner in her 
interest. Helidorus was a deadly enemy to Bylifsky and 
Arner, as also to the schemes they advocated for the 
improvement of existing evils, and therefore was glad to 
make use of Sylvia’s aid in obtaining information regarding 
the course things were taking in Bonnal under the new 
administration. He had been rendered very uneasy, both 
by the reports of Gliilphi’s school, and the news that Arner 
and Theresa, the pastor and his wife, Cotton Meyer and his 
sister, and the mason’s wife Gertrude, met together every 
week to discuss the affairs of the village. Since, through 
Bylifsky’s influence, the Duke was becoming interested in 
Arner’s innovations, Helidorus felt there was need of a bold
-P-A-G-E-171
  LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 161 
fiove on his own part, to nip the success of his rivals in the 
bud. It was accordingly with the hope of bringing Arner 
into ill repute, and making his dreams the laughter of the 
court, that he induced Sylvia to go to Arnheim, trusting 
to her known ability for mischief-making to take advantage 
of her opportunities when on the spot. 
Arner was not without a foreboding of evil when he 
learned the projected visit; and indeed, Sylvia had not been 
many days in the house, before her influence began to make 
itself felt. She tried in every way to turn her uncle against 
Arner, talking of the unsuitable education he was giving his 
son Karl, and ridiculing the way in which he granted audi- 
ence to every old peasant woman who came to the Castle. 
Worst of all, however, were Sylvia’s attempts to injure the 
lieutenant. She caused the huntsman they had brought 
with them to spread various bad reports about Gliilphi in the 
village, and the credulous peasants were not slow to believe 
that their new schoolmaster was a runaway soldier, who 
could find no asylum elsewhere. This slander was so 
injurious to the good cause in Bonnal, that the pastor at 
length found it necessary to inform Arner of the matter, and 
sent Michael with a letter to Arnheim. 
It was a hot day, and there was company at the Castle. 
After drinking rather more freely than usual, the general 
had seated himself with Sylvia on the terrace. Suddenly 
she pointed to a peasant standing at the outer gate, and 
said: ‘¢ Arner will leave us again now, as somebody has 
come for him.’? In the old man’s excited state, this was 
like adding fuel to fire, and he called out to the fellow to be 
gone. But Michael would not depart without delivering his 
jetter, and only drew back a little to bide his time. ‘‘There!” 
exclaimed Sylvia to her uncle; ‘‘ you see, every peasant 
knows how much power you have here!” — and with such 
words she led him on, until he called to the huntsman below 
to chase the peasant away with the dogs.
-P-A-G-E-172
  162 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. , 
At this moment, the general was summoned in to his 
game, and the huntsman would have calmly minded his own 
business, had not Sylvia beckoned to him to fulfil his orders. 
Karl was looking on, and when he saw the two dogs loosed 
and set on the unoffending man, he followed at full speed, 
calling them back. He seized Sultan, the hindermost, by 
the collar, and ran on with him, shouting : ‘¢ Turk, Turk!” 
Sylvia stood watching the scene from the terrace, as if it 
were a comedy, and called after Karl. ‘‘ You foolish boy! 
He will not eat him!” This was true; indeed, the dog 
would not even have bitten him, had Michael understood his 
training ; for the dogs of the Castle were taught, when sent 
after poor people, to tear off a generous piece of their rags, 
and then let them go free. But Michael, ignorant of this, 
planted his back against the wall, and received the animal 
with his knotted stick, with the air of one who has seen dogs 
before, and is not afraid of them. Turk was so astonished 
at this unusual reception, that, forgetting his rules of breed- 
ing, he behaved like a dog without education, and buried his 
teeth in the peasant’s thigh. Michael, however, being the 
stronger of the two, swung his stick, and dealt his assailant 
so sharp a blow on the ribs, that the creature retreated with 
a howl, just as Karl came up with Sultan. 
**Come with me,” said the boy kindly, reaching the 
wounded man his hand. Then he excused his father, saying 
that he was not at all to blame. ‘I know he is not,” said 
Michael; ‘‘ and I would think none the less of him if I were 
to die of it.” 
** But you will not die? — you will not?” asked Karl anx- 
iously, as he saw the red drops trickling down his side. The 
blood flowed more and more freely, and feeling he was on the 
point of fainting, Michael begged the boy to send Klaus to 
him as quickly as possible. 
When he had done this, Karl went directly to the parlor,
-P-A-G-E-173
  LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 163 
just as he was, with rumpled hair and bloody hands, and 
pressed through the throng of gentlemen and ladies, to tell 
his father what had happened. Sylvia called out, with the 
cards in her hand, that she begged the young gentleman not 
to make such a fuss, for she had seen the whole affair, and 
knew that the fellow had gone away from the Castle safe and 
sound, so that he could not be much hurt, — besides, it was 
all his own fault. Arner interrupted her voluble speech, 
and requested her with dignity to allow the child to relate 
what had happened. The attention of all was aroused, as 
the boy began anew: ‘It is all her fault, — and nobody else 
is to blame!” 
At this moment the housekeeper rushed into the room, 
exclaiming breathlessly: ‘‘The man is lying dead on the 
lawn!” 
The words had hardly left her lips before Arner was out 
of the room and down the stairs, not heeding that in his 
haste his spur had caught in the table-cloth, dragging por- 
celain, glass and silver to the floor. Theresa followed him. 
As they reached the spot, Michael awoke from his swoon, 
and was much gratified by their sympathy. Arner himself 
helped him into the house, and causing his wound to be 
dressed with the utmost care, sent him home in a litter.
-P-A-G-E-174
  164 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
CHAPTER XXXIV. 
THE PEASANTS TAKE JUSTICE INTO THEIR OWN HANDS. 
Wuen Arner read the letter delivered to him by Michael, 
he groaned out: ‘‘ It is too much for one day!’’ He trem- 
bled so with rage and grief that he could not finish reading, 
and Theresa, catching a glimpse of his face, exclaimed: 
‘Good Heavens! You look worse than Michael himself! ” 
‘¢T wish” — he answered with fixed eyes — ‘‘I wish that 
only a dog had bitten me! A worse beast is gnawing at my 
heart.” 
This sounded so unlike Arner that Theresa was terrified. 
“Do go to bed,” she pleaded ; ‘‘ you are sick!” He was 
obliged to follow her advice, for when he attempted to rise, 
he sank back powerless. That evening he was in a high 
fever. 
The effects of the wine over, the general, also, was unable 
to sleep that night. Confused pictures of the event with the 
dog filled his mind; he did not quite know whether he or 
Sylvia had been to blame, or whether the man was really 
dead. He heard Klaus going back and forth from Arner’s 
room, and called to him to know what was the matter, and 
whether the man was dead. ‘‘ No, he is not dead, but might 
have been; and my master is far from well,” answered the 
servant. 
The general questioned him narrowly with regard to the 
incident, and learned that everybody regarded Sylvia as the 
sole cause of the mishap. ‘‘ Then many people know that 
she is to blame?” the old gentleman inquired.
-P-A-G-E-175
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 165 
“¢ Certainly.” 
‘¢ And what did they say to it?” 
“Your Grace can imagine what common people would say, 
when they think they might have been in his place.” 
‘No, tell me just what they said.” 
‘Well, then, they said it was a cursed trick, and it would 
be good enough for her if she should get her reward for it in 
this world. I beg your Grace not to be offended.” 
“Certainly not. God be praised that the man is not 
dead!” 
‘* Your Grace may well say that on the lady’s account.” 
‘* How so?” 
‘¢ She wouldn’t be sure of her life if he had died.”’ 
‘¢ But certainly no one would do her any injury now?” 
“‘T wouldn’t advise her to go very far from the Castle 
alone, Sir, until the first storm has blown over.” 
Encouraged by the friendliness of the general, Klaus went 
on to speak very frankly of Sylvia’s unpopularity in the vil- 
lage, and also informed him of the reports she had been 
circulating about the lieutenant. The old man was over- 
whelmed by what he had heard, and going to Sylvia’s room 
in the morning, he told her of Arner’s illness, and reproached 
her for her conduct regarding Gltilphi. Enraged at this 
reproof, she declared she had been slandered, and would go 
alone to Bonnal as soon as lunch, to investigate the matter. 
The general mentioned the warning he had received from 
Klaus, and besought her to take some one with her; but his 
very anxiety aroused her antagonism, and she set forth quite 
alone toward the village. 
In the tavern by the wayside, that afternoon, the peasants 
were talking of Sylvia. There was but one voice among 
them ; all declared that such an inhuman deed had not been 
done within the memory of man, and that it would be a 
praiseworthy action for the first of them who met her to set
-P-A-G-E-176
  
166 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
his dog on her. A butcher came forth from this conclave, 
and was driving his cart along the outskirts of the wood, 
when he saw a single figure on the road before him. Small, 
thin, dressed like no one else, full of all sorts of angles and 
flourishes, so that whoever looked at her saw something 
beside the individual herself, — yes, the description certainly 
corresponded, and the solitary wayfarer could be no other 
than the obnoxious Sylvia. 
The butcher’s blood seethed ; his heart beat violently. He 
looked about him, but no one was in sight. He turned his 
cart into the border of the wood, while his strong young dog 
wagged his tail, and sprang to and fro. ‘‘ Shall I, or shall 
I not?” the man asked himself. The temptation was too 
strong, and pointing with his finger through the fir-trees, he 
gave the animal a signal. The dog sprang forward, and in 
an instant had reached his goal. True to his training, he did 
not touch his victim with his teeth, but jumped upon her, 
sprang down and bounded about her, and then leaped upon 
her again, barking loudly the while. Sylvia’s girdle broke 
beneath the paws of her assailant, and the thin upper gar- 
ment tore from top to bottom whenever he touched her, so 
that she was soon surrounded by white fluttering shreds. 
The net from the back of her head hung down upon her neck, 
and its artificial contents fell out upon the ground, while the 
air around was rent with her screams. 
The butcher calmly took out his watch, and said to him- 
self: ‘‘ Two minutes she shall have!” — at the end of which 
time he whistled the dog back again. The huntsman, whom 
the general, in his anxiety, had sent after his niece, heard 
cries of distress for some time, before it entered his head 
that such a screeching could proceed from the lips of his 
gracious mistress. When he came near enough to see the 
source of the disturbance, the picture which presented itself 
to his view was almost too much for his gravity, and he was
-P-A-G-E-177
  LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 167 
obliged to turn away and compose his features, before he 
vould come forward and ask the cause of Sylvia’s sad 
plight. 
To her explanation that a mad dog had assailed her, the 
huntsman lent an incredulous ear, and informed her that mad 
dogs were notin the habit of making rents in people’s clothes 
without biting. Nevertheless, Sylvia was almost beside her- 
self with fear, and fancied herself in the first stages of hydro- 
phobia, although everybody assured her that the scratches 
she had received here and there were from the claws and not 
the teeth of the animal. She was also quite unable to give 
any description of the dog which had attacked her; it was 
larger than she herself, she said, — she had never seen such 
teeth, and such cavernous jaws. She could not even say 
what color the creature was, — it had appeared to her first 
white, then black; and it seemed to her now that she had 
seen nothing but its head and mouth. There was naturally 
nothing to be gathered from such an account, and nobody 
knew exactly what steps to take in the matter. 
When Sylvia awoke the next morning to a calmer mood, 
she remembered to have heard a whistle from the woods, 
and had no doubt the dog must have been set on her. A 
desire of revenge at once filled her soul, and she advocated 
arresting every peasant who kept a dog and was in the habit 
of whistling. When her uncle did not favor such summary 
measures, she asked reproachfully: ‘‘ Will you not imprison 
a single man on my account?” 
‘¢ Not even a cat at random,” replied the general coldly, 
as he left the room. 
Sylvia’s pride was deeply humbled, and she fell into a 
species of dejection. She felt of how little consequence she 
was in the world, and that she was not even able to carry out 
her designs against Arner. What no living man could have 
done, the butcher’s dog had accomplished, — he had brought 
her to a knowledge of herself!

CHAPTER XXXV. 
RESULTS OF ARNER’S ILLNESS, AND THE BETROTHAL OF A 
STEP-MOTHER. 
Arner constantly grew sicker; each night the fever was 
higher, and day after day saw his strength wane. Theresa 
and the children could neither sleep nor eat from anxiety, 
and every hour seemed a year. All the inhabitants of the 
Castle were panic-stricken, the general most of all; he lost 
flesh and color more than the sick man himself, and passed 
more sleepless nights than he had ever done in all his life 
before. The thought was ever present in his mind that 
Arner must die, and he was to blame. Sylvia’s condition 
was scarcely better, although owing to a different cause, for 
Arner’s fate did not concern her in the least. The servants 
were so incensed at the cause of their master’s illness, that 
a word would have sufficed to make them throw her out of 
the window; and they would hardly suffer the huntsman 
among them. Arner alone was calm,—for the fever had 
left his head clear; and he spoke cheerfully with his wife 
and friends of his approaching end. 
When the news reached the village that Arner was at the 
point of death, the children began to cry with one impulse, 
and many of the parents wept with them, while all could 
relate some kindness he had done them or theirs. But after 
an hour had passed, the state of feeling was altered. They 
regarded him as dead, and began to think what changes his 
absence would bring about. More swiftly than the spider 
spins its thread, the strangest thoughts and desires were
-P-A-G-E-179
  
  LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 169 
evolved from the brains of these villagers. Whoever had 
wanted something which Arner had prevented him from 
obtaining, or whoever was not satisfied with the existing 
order of things, began to think: ‘‘ Now all will be different.” 
The wealthy peasants had never forgotten the humiliation 
they had suffered under the linden-tree, and the paupers to 
whom Arner had advanced the money for goats, thought that 
now they would not be obliged to pay him. Wine was brought 
across the mountain to the tavern in broad daylight, and the 
herd-boys drove their animals into the enclosures of the poor, 
while the rich laughed. 
The Bailiff Meyer had never felt so comfortable since he 
wore the mantle of office, and asked everybody from the 
Castle, with a melancholy face, whether it was really true 
that there was no-hope of recovery. His wife was likewise 
content, for she thought her rich cousin, the innkeeper, 
might now be successful with her sister-in-law, who would 
certainly give up all thoughts of Hiibel-Rudy. Meyer went 
to his sister to advise her on this point, but she indignantly 
repulsed him. It enraged her that they should imagine she 
could marry a man solely on Arner’s account, and also that 
they should take advantage of the latter’s sickness to deprive 
poor Rudy of his wished-for bride. ‘‘ No!” she cried, as 
soon as she was alone; ‘‘ I will show them that I don’t take 
him for Arner’s sake, but for his own! The poor man has 
waited long enough, — I will take him now, in God’s name.” 
Tears fell from her eyes; she thought no more of either 
the Bailiff or his wife, and even forgot how she had come 
to her decision; she only saw Rudy and his children before 
her, and their room with the engravings on the wall. Clos- 
ing the door, she took down her prayer-book from its shelf, 
and read aloud the prayer of a daughter who is about to 
enter the estate of matrimony; then laying her head upon 
her hands, she moistened the page with her tears, and prayed
-P-A-G-E-180
  170 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
God to bless her resolution. She finally dried her eyes, and 
went with a full heart to the mason’s house. 
Gertrude was displeased with her friend for keeping Rudy 
so long in suspense, and when she saw her coming slowly up 
the street with an absent gaze, she had no suspicion of the 
tidings she was bringing, and would not even step to the 
door to meet her. Meyer’s sister came in and sat heavily 
down, gasping out as if short of breath: ‘‘I have made up 
my mind, and am going to take him.” 
Gertrude thought she referred to the rich innkeeper, and 
answered with sad reproach in her tones: ‘‘ I wouldn’t have 
thought it of you!” 
‘* What?” inquired her visitor surprised. 
‘* That you could be such a weather-cock ! ” 
‘* How do you mean? Don’t you understand what I say? 
Or what is the matter?” ; 
“Tt grieves me that all of a sudden you turn round and 
take the innkeeper, just because Arner is sick.” 
** Now at last you speak so that I can understand you!” 
said Meyer’s sister smiling. 
‘*Can you laugh?” asked Gertrude with tears in her eyes. 
**T have cause.” 
‘¢ Indeed you have not!—and you make me angry.” 
“Oh, I was only joking; he doesn’t know it yet, and if 
you will make it up with me, who knows what I might do to 
please you?” 
‘¢ You will drive me distracted!” 
‘¢ And you amuse me! Don’t you see that you are under 
a mistake? I am not going to take the innkeeper” — 
‘But — surely you were not speaking of Rudy!” cried 
Gertrude, a light breaking in upon her at last. 
Soon after this explanation, the two friends set out for 
Rudy’s cottage. He was winding his children’s yarn, but 
the reel stood still in his hand when he saw them cross the 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
  
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 171 
threshold. He could not move or speak. Meyer’s sister 
seated herself beside him, and Gertrude said: ‘‘ Now she is 
yours!” 
The children rose from their wheels, and Gertrude said to 
them: ‘‘ Now she is your mother!” Meyer’s sister took 
them one after the other by the hand, saying: ‘‘ Dear chil- 
dren, may God bless us together!” — and then Rudy, who 
held her hand in both of his, added: ‘‘ God grant it!” 
She spent the whole evening in the house, telling Gertrude 
it would give her pleasure to do as if she already belonged 
there. Accordingly, she took Rudy’s reel, saying it did not 
go exactly right, and wound away merrily; she helped the 
children with their wheels, braided the hair of two of them, 
and cooked porridge for the little ones. She took the baby 
in her lap, and fed it; then undressing it, she held it a while 
naked in her arms, as the painted Madonna does the Christ- 
child; and after making it say good night to all its brothers 
and sisters, she put it to bed and sang it to sleep. When 
she went home, she picked a bunch of flowers from Rudy’s 
garden, and carried it with her.

CHAPTER XXXVI. 
SUSPENSE, JOY, AND A WEDDING. 
Tue idea became more and more diffused in the village 
that Arner’s death would bring about a universal change. 
When the children came home from school and related that 
the lieutenant always had red eyes, many of the parents 
made answer: ‘‘ He has good cause; his bread and butter 
are gone, when Arner dies.” Speeches of this sort made 
the children so anxious, that after school they gathered 
about Gliilphi, and the one who stood nearest asked him, 
trembling, to please tell them if he would not be able to be 
their schoolmaster any longer, in case Arner died? At first 
he was unable to speak, so much was he moved; he stood 
by the window and gasped for breath, like a man who is 
suffocating. Then turning, he stretched out both arms, and 
cried: ‘* My children, even if it should please God not to 
restore Arner to us, I will still remain with you!” The 
children went joyfully home, but their parents did not believe 
his words. 
When the village talk about the lieutenant came to 
Maria’s ears, she begged her brother, Cotton Meyer, to 
insure the safety of the new school, and also induced the 
wife of the younger Renold to interest her husband in the 
project. They all went together to good old Renold, whom 
every one loved and respected, and he gladly consented to 
be their agent in the affair. He went from house to house, 
to all the richest peasants in Bonnal, and after laying the 
matter before them, remarked that if they were not willing 
   
-P-A-G-E-183
  
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 173 
to sign the pledge he carried, for the good of their children 
and of the village, he himself would stand surety for their 
portion of the expense of the school, and would write them 
down as recipients of this charity. This means was effec- 
tual, for no one was willing to be enrolled on the charity 
list; so that by evening the number of signatures was 
complete. 
Meanwhile, the news of Arner’s illness had spread to the 
court of the Duke, and Bylifsky begged for permission to 
set out at once for Arnheim. The Duke not only granted 
his request, but bade him take the court physician with him, 
and use means to secure Arner from annoyance of every 
kind. The renowned doctor shrugged his shoulders when he 
saw his patient ; then he opened his medicine-box, and every 
sort of perfume filled the room. Frightful silver and gold 
pincers, needles, knives, sponges and bandages, pieces of 
snakes, pulverized flies, poison, metals, semi-metals, chemi- 
cal secrets and natural powders, salves and plasters, all lay 
together in this chest. He weighed, mixed, rubbed, heated 
and cooled, and before an hour had passed, Arner had a 
sample of all the above on his body, and no less a variety 
within. 
The condition of the sick man had become very critical ; 
he fell into a sort of stupor, and the physician ordered the 
family to leave the room. They waited outside in terrible 
suspense, momentarily expecting the news of his death. 
Theresa had fainted ; the children sank on their knees, and 
the pastor prayed aloud. Suddenly there was a slight move- 
ment inside; the doctor opened the door noiselessly, and 
whispered: ‘‘ He perspires, and I still have some hope.” A 
quarter of an hour later, the report was still favorable, and 
all through the suspense of that dreadful night the tidings 
were constantly encouraging. 
The next morning he was decidedly better, but so weak
-P-A-G-E-184
  
174 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
that the physician forbade any one to visit him. Bylifsky 
only saw him through the half-open door, and then spent 
the day with the pastor and lieutenant in Bonnal. The 
minister examined with the closest attention all the changes 
which had taken place of late in the village, and remained 
in the school during both sessions, from the opening to the 
close. He inspected narrowly the work of the children, and 
paid especial attention to the union of study and manual 
labor, but said not a word until he had seen all. Then he 
expressed to the somewhat anxious lieutenant the warmest 
approbation of his methods. ‘‘I find your plans in harmony 
both with the inner nature of man and his actual social con- 
dition,” he said. (*Man is only happy and secure in this 
world, when he is so developed as to be able to fill well that 
place in society to which he can legitimately lay claim 
This demand is met by your methods in a more perfect 
degree than I have ever seen before. Yes, my dear lieu- 
tenant, if the Cabinet had wished to originate a plan by 
which the people should be educated from the stand-point of 
y their greatest capacity for useful service, it would have been 
necessary to set to work in very much the same way that 
you have done.” 
A tear trembled in Gliilphi’s eye, but he could not speak. 
Bylifsky pressed his hand, and said in parting: ‘‘ Count on 
me, but keep on with your work as if you did not know me, 
and as if there were no such person as I in the world.” 
Arner’s recovery progressed slowly from day to day. 
The people of Bonnal now discovered that there was no one 
on earth so dear to them as he, and many were the tokens of 
sympathy and interest which he received. The children 
formed a procession, and went to the Castle to congratulate 
their beloved father on his recovery. He received them 
kindly, and talked long with them, of their school, their 
goats, and their savings. Before long, it was known in the  
-P-A-G-E-185
  LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 175 
village that the Bailiff Meyer had been replaced in office by 
Cotton Meyer, and great was the rejoicing of the poor at 
this event. 
The first time that Arner was able to drive from the Cas- 
tle to the Bonnal church, a grand festival was planned in his 
honor. The bells pealed at sunrise, and all the inhabitants, 
old and young, went forth to meet him. The children were 
adorned with flowers, and the procession was led by Rudy’s 
bridal party, for he had determined to be married on that 
day. 
‘When they heard Arner’s carriage in the distance, they all 
ran to meet him, so that he heard their glad shouts of wel- 
come before he could see them through the fir-trees. He 
descended from his carriage, and hastened toward his de- 
voted people on foot. After exchanging greetings with all, 
he placed himself at the head of the throng, with Rudy by 
his side, while Theresa led Meyer’s sister, and the whole 
procession streamed joyously down the mountain to the 
church. There they knelt and gave thanks to God for 
sparing Arner’s life, and sang a hymn of praise, after which 
the bridal pair was led to the altar. 
Such a wedding had never been seen in Bonnal! The 
bells rang merrily, while Arner led the bride to the parson- 
age, and Theresa followed with Rudy. They found the 
house surrounded with chairs and tables, the latter laden 
with wine and bread, cheese and milk, sausages and cakes, 
enough for young and old. After this rustic banquet, the 
villagers danced on the green, being joined in the pastime 
by Arner and Theresa. Even the general and the pastor’s 
wife danced too, and the hearts of all were full of joy.

CHAPTER XXXVII. 
CONCLUSION. 
Over a year had passed since Arner’s illness, and his 
beneficent activity flowed on unimpeded, with less and less 
friction as each day went by. He had supplemented his 
innovations with laws which should protect the interests of — gh eee 
the individhal, snd at the same time Hap a restraint upon 
every violation of order. The new Bailiff, meanwhile, took 
wctey whidh aatouished even Arner and the lieutenant. He 
assembled the whole community, and told them that, without 
any difficulty or hardship, they could collect within twenty-five 
years a capital sufficient to liquidate all taxes and duties 
which clung to their land like a perpetual rent, and thus 
transmit their estates tithe-free to their children. This he 
demonstrated to them could be easily accomplished by regu- 
larly laying aside a small proportion of each man’s annual 
gains. Anybody who is acquainted with peasants knows 
that they would almost be willing to hang themselves for the 
sake of tithe-free lands, so it may be readily imagined that 
the villagers lent themselves with alacrity to the scheme, as 
soon as they were convinced of its practicability. Cotton 
Meyer also succeeded in convincing Arner and the lieutenant 
of the reasonableness of his views, and they saw plainly that 
a village which was in condition to amass a capital of forty 
thousand florins in twenty-five years could do far more, — 
that this would be but the beginning of its prosperity. The 
impulse which had already been given to economy and thrift 
in Bonnal had so greatly reduced the number of malefac-
-P-A-G-E-187
  LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 177 
tors, that Arner now found it possible to remove the gallows, 
establishing in their stead a sort of hospital, in which the 
few criminals might be gently led back to better and more 
orderly lives. 
In all this time, not a word had been heard from the 
Duke. Bylifsky was in constant correspondence with Arner, 
and showed the liveliest sympathy with all that went forward, 
but never referred to the Prince. This surprised and dis- 
turbed Arner a little, after the interest the Duke had ex- 
pressed in their plans; but the lieutenant recalled Bylifsky’s 
parting words, and felt sure he had good reasons for his 
silence on this point. He was right; the minister was so 
fearful that all would be ruined by a premature examination 
of the Bonnal projects, before they should become firmly 
enough established to guarantee their success, that far from 
trying to heighten the Duke’s interest in Arner and Gliilphi, 
he ceased to speak of them, and did not even oppose Heli- 
dorus when he ridiculed the philanthropic dreams of his 
friends before the court. Every one but Helidorus believed 
the whole affair was a failure; but the favorite was too 
shrewd not to see that the enemy had only withdrawn to 
strengthen himself for the battle which sooner or later must 
take place. 
Arner was meanwhile in the greatest perplexity with regard 
to the general, who inundated him with letters, imploring 
him to cease making himself the laughing-stock of the court. 
One day he was sitting, trying in vain to concoct a satisfac- 
tory answer, when he was unexpectedly delivered from his 
dilemma. A letter arrived from the minister, declaring that 
the matter was now ripe for action, and that he himself was 
on the point of suggesting to the Duke to investigate the 
attempts which had been made in Bonnal, with a view to 
extending them more widely. Arner joyfully despatched 
this letter to his uncle, as the best answer it was in his power 
ep give.  
-P-A-G-E-188
  178 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
At about the same hour, Bylifsky asked the Duke for a 
private audience, and unfolded to him the progress of 
Arner’s projects, calling his attention to the difference 
between the popular institutions of this little village and 
those of the realm at large, and drawing a vivid picture of 
the corruption of the land. ‘‘ You know, Bylifsky,” sighed 
the Prince, ‘‘ how deeply I feel the truth of your words ; but 
I am quite convinced that it is impossible to improve the 
condition of things.” 
“Your Highness, I know it is difficult; yet I am convinced 
that there is one way, and only one, — and that is, for the 
government to exert an influence on the development of the 
people.” 
“Ts such an influence possible?” 
“The success with which Arner’s endeavors have been 
crowned would seem to make it so.” 
‘*Can you see no difference between the government of a 
whole people, and the private influence exerted by a noble- 
man over his little village?” 
‘¢Certainly; but the means which Arner employed are 
just as much in the hands of your Highness, in respect to 
the country in general, as they were in Arner’s with regard 
to his village.” 
‘“‘T wish you could demonstrate the truth of that state- 
ment.” 
‘* And would the names of Endorf and Nelkron be a sufli- 
cient guaranty?” asked the minister, mentioning the two 
men who stood respectively foremost in the state in finance 
and jurisprudence. 
The Duke was thunderstruck on learning that two such 
patterns of caution and political wisdom favored the designs 
of Arner; but he exclaimed after an inward struggle: ‘‘ No, 
even they shall not make me waste the last quarter of my 
life as I have the other three!” Then changing his tone, 
he inquired: ‘‘ What is it that you want? Money?”
-P-A-G-E-189
  
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 179 
“No.” 
‘Strange! What, then, do you desire?” 
‘An investigation on the part of the state, as to the pos- 
sibility of applying Arner’s principles to universal govern- 
ment.” 
‘¢ And then what further?” 
‘¢ The establishment of a new professorship, for the pur- 
pose of acquainting the noblemen of the realm with better 
principles of popular government, and also the appointment 
of a commission, whose duty shall be to counsel and assist 
every one who shows a disposition to carry out these prin- 
ciples.” 
“ Strange — very strange!” mused the Prince. ‘And 
you need no money ?— no buildings ?—no institutions of any 
sort?” 
‘Nothing but a few dozen account-books, in which to 
register all that is done by those connected with this com- 
mission, so as to have everything clear before one’s eyes, 
like a merchant’s debit and credit account.” 
The Duke meditated with himself a while, and then resolved 
to appoint a commission, under the control of Helidorus, to 
set forth the objections and difficulties in the way of a uni- 
versal application of the scheme ; after which Bylifsky should 
have the privilege of replying to each point raised. 
When the documents were placed in the Prince’s hands, 
he marvelled at the weakness of Helidorus’s side, and sum- 
moning Bylifsky, told him he had decided to investigate 
whether Arner Lad really accomplished all that was claimed 
for him, and if so, whether it were possible to extend his 
innovations to other villages, and so through the whole 
country. ‘‘ And to insure thoroughness,’ added the Duke, 
«there must be among the examiners men skilled in law and 
finance, merchants, clergymen, government officials, school- 
masters and physicians, beside women of different ranks and
-P-A-G-E-190
  180 LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 
| 
conditions, who shall view the matter with their woman’s 
eyes, and be sure that there is nothing visionary in the back- 
ground.” 
He proposed to Helidorus to choose one department for 
himself in the investigation, but the favorite declined, pre- 
ferring to watch the game from a distance. He only gave 
the Duke a parting bit of advice, as the latter was setting 
out for Bonnal. “These gentlemen,” he said, “know that 
you are coming, and have wound up their clock so that it 
will go during your stay; but if you can manage to stop the 
principal wheels for awhile, you will perhaps be able to see 
the weakness of the whole machine.” 
The Prince had forbidden the examiners to express any 
opinion with regard to the several departments on which 
they were engaged, until they had reported to him; and this 
was a wise regulation. or at first sight, the whole affair 
seemed too ambitious, too exalted, for its universal appli- 
eation to lie within the power of man, Yet as they exam- 
ined the details, day after day, they became more and more 
convinced of the practicability of the whole, and on the sixth 
day they unanimously recommended the introduction of the 
same principles into general government. 
The Duke could hardly believe the evidence of his senses, 
when he found what had been accomplished by the simple 
application of human industry and wisdom He talked with 
the lieutenant and Cotton Meyer; he saw the children of 
Hiibel-Rudy, who had formerly lived in the depths of poy- 
erty and wretchedness ; and Glulphi, pointing to Gertrude, 
said: ‘‘ It was she who made them orderly and industrious, 
and she it was who had my school in her room, long before 
I ever thought of it; without hers, I never should have 
made mine what it is.” 
The Prince was deeply moved by all he saw and heard; 
he felt himself so carried away by his sympathy as to be ne
-P-A-G-E-191
  
LEONARD AND GERTRUDE. 181 
longer capable of a calm and disinterested judgment. At 
this moment he bethought himself of the advice of Heli- 
dorus. ‘‘I will be impartial, and will stop the wheels!” he 
exclaimed. Accordingly, he said to Arner, the lieutenant, 
the pastor and Cotton Meyer: ‘‘ You must all four go to 
Sklavenheim, where I will leave you alone three days; 
during this period, examine the place, and find out how far 
you can apply your theories to the orphans and prisoners 
there. I will meanwhile try to take a calmer view of 
matters here, which seem to float before me as in a dream.” 
When they had gone, the Duke watched with the eyes of 
a lynx, to see whether he could detect any change in the 
affairs of Bonnal, but in vain; everything went its accus- 
tomed way, precisely as before. On the fourth day he set 
out for Sklavenheim, with no expectation of what awaited 
him. Under the lieutenant’s charge he found a school like 
the one in Bonnal, begun with twelve orphan children; ten 
men from the House of Correction had, under Meyer’s in- 
struction, made rapid progress in the art of spinning; while 
Arner and the pastor had collected facts with reference to 
the history and treatment of the prisoners and the seventy 
orphans, which threw a hideous light on the present con- 
dition of popular institutions in the land. 
While the Prince stood lost in wonder at the work of three 
days, he was aroused by a noise. The band of prisoners and 
the troop of children lay at his feet, and begged for fathers 
and guides like these four gentlemen. ‘‘ Rise up, ye cap- 
tives!” he cried; ‘‘rise up, my children! Your fate is in 
their hand.” - He could say no more. The children re- 
mained upon their knees, and a holy silence reigned, while 
all hearts were filled with sweetest promise for the future.  
-P-A-G-E-192

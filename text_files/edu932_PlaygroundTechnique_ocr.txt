PREFACE 
T has fallen to our lot to act as guide for the infant steps of several play- 
ground movements. In the early days many problems confronted 
the playground worker. The woods were full of philosophies but 
the practical application had to be worked out by hard knocks. During 
the past years, we have been the recipients of many of these; making many 
mistakes, we have acquired some practical knowledge and perhaps chanced 
upon the proper solution of some problems. 
In presenting this book, we hope that as a result some may be spared 
many of the commonest mistakes and may profit by the things which have 
been found essential, when judged by our own experience and the experi- 
ence of other pioneer workers in the play movement, whose work has 
assisted in the preparation of this book. 
The attempt will be made in this series to correlate the work of the 
various playground interests throughout the country. The salient features 
in a number of typical playground movements will be described. As the 
ground to be covered is so extensive, only those which have made unusual, 
unique and historical contributions to playground knowledge can be given 
place in the discussion. 
Necessarily this series could be prepared only through the combined 
experience and codperation of the many workers who have contributed to 
the play movement. 
The editors extend thanks and acknowledgment of assistance to these 
workers for permission to use extracts from their writings and to the members 
of the Advisory Committee for suggestions, assistance and special articles. 
To the various magazines and publishers, who have given permission 
for reprinting the articles so credited in the book. 
To Dr. William W. Hastings for reading manuscript and making 
suggestions thereon. 
To Olmsted Bros., John Bacon Hutchings, Hunt, Eager and Burns, 
and others for plans of playgrounds and buildings which are incorporated 
in the book. 
To Lafon Allen, President of the Recreation League, and John Bacon 
Hutchings for furnishing photographs of Louisville playgrounds. 
To Charles Mulford Robinson and the Children’s Playground League 
for photographs of Rochester playgrounds. 
To Miss Bessie D. Stoddart and C. B. Raitt for photographs, plans, 
descriptions and estimates of Los Angeles playgrounds.

INTRODUCTION 
In presenting to the public Prayarounp TrcHnique anv Pray- 
craFtT there is recorded by Mr. and Mrs. Leland a step forward in the 
practical working out of the real problems of the whole playground move- 
ment. The authors have the advantage of years of solid experience, and 
speak not in the manner of old maids lecturing on the care of children to 
Mothers’ Clubs, but as those who have been through the birth throes, 
infantile diseases and obstreperous childhood of the playground itself. 
Mr. Leland is one of the pioneers in the practical work of playground 
organization, construction and administration. It is doubtless this fact 
that has inspired the confidence which has secured for him on the Advisory 
Committee such a large majority of the playground experts of the United 
States. 
Time was when movements developed more slowly, and when people 
were satisfied for a generation with books and pamphlets dealing in popular 
opinions and disorganized generalities, but this is no longer true. The 
public demands facts, and it wants them in accurate and organized form. 
When we buy a book today we want the author to have really done our 
thinking for us. We want it well illustrated for the same reason. ‘Time 
was when we expected only the facts of a science to be given us. Now 
we want to be shown what to do with the facts, how to teach them to others 
and how to take our place in the organized movements of the times, in brief, 
the public has not time to “ Fletcherize” its mental pabulum. 
The playground movement has made such phenomenal strides in the 
last ten years—even in the last five years, and the demand for accurate 
information has become so great in every quarter that such a book had 
to be provided. Some of the commonest needs and the most frequent 
requests which come to the editor and to the playground leader are with 
reference to the best books and articles on games and plays and on the 
problems of the movement, the best mode of appeal for rousing public 
sympathy and touching pocketbooks, how to organize a campaign for a 
playground, what qualities should be emphasized in the make-up of the 
leader or supervisor, what are the sanest and most economical plans for 
playground construction, what are the essentials of playground equipment, 
and how can the greatest economy of effort and of money be assured. 
Most of these questions are answered in PLayGROUND TECHNIQUE AND 
PLaycrarr in a concise way by practical, experienced people. 
In PLaycrounp TECHNIQUE AND Praycrart there has been grouped 
and stated for the first time the essentials of the various phases of the sub- 
ject. That is the chief function of this work,—to provide accurate infor- 
mation along every line for the playground worker and supporter.

A secondary but exceedingly important function of this volume is the 
provision of construction plans and specifications for all useful playground 
apparatus, showing how to make a dollar do the work of two. First things 
are always the hardest to secure and first money must always be husbanded 
with greatest care. This department will, therefore. prove invaluable to 
the majority of supervisors and committees on construction. 
The publication of reprints of these construction plans and specifica- 
tions, for use by architects, contractors, machine shops, mechanics, and 
others engaged in the work of practical construction. will do much to sim- 
plify and cheapen the process. It puts accurate information within the 
reach of all, and encourages the equipment of model playgrounds for the 
inauguration of the movement where it has hitherto been deemed imprac- 
ticable. 
There is nothing so valuable as accurate figures and a well-outhined 
plan to inspire confidence in a movement. PrayGrocxp TECHN JQUE AND 
Puaycrarr will be found helpful by all who require real information and 
Inspiration.

“We have gone far to civilize the business of play out of 
existence.” 
“Rather a playground without a school than a school 
without a playground.”—Dr. Woods Hutchinson. 
“Much of the burden of future education, in teaching 
children loyalty, honesty, cooperation and self-sacrifice, rests 
on the public playground instructor. The very foundations 
of the Republie are to be worked out on the public play- 
ground; that is where boys learn how to resist evil. A young 
man will never in his life have such great temptations, in the 
midst of such absorbing interests, as on the ball field, when 
he wants to cut corners. ‘There he learns that it doesn’t pay 
to play crooked. Where can he show greater self-sacrifice than 
when he effaces himself in order that his team may make 
another run?”—Thos, A. Curley.
-P-A-G-E-15
“Gentleness and cheerfulness, these come before all 
morality; they are the perfect duties.” 
“If your morals make you dreary, depend upon it they 
are wrong. Ido not say ‘give them v9, for they may be all 
you have; but conceal them like a vice, lest they should spoil 
the lives of better and simpler people.” 
“There is an idea abroad among moral people that they 
should make their neighbors good. One person I have to 
make good: myself. ut my duty to ‘ny neighbor is much 
arly express yy sal that ave to e him 
happy—it I may."—Robort Louis Stevenson. ™

THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLAY AND ITS APPLICATION

« have playgrounds? Why? Why does a flower 
need light? t : child needs a playground because his 
growth is through activity, through those specific forms of 
activity which his nature has prescribed, and because. accord- 
ingly be will never grow up—or he will grow up stunted and 
perverted—if he is denied those opportunities and objects to 
which his vital, instinctive and formative activities relate.” 
_ “The thing that most needs to be understood about play 
is that it is not a luxury but a necessity. It is not simply something that a child likes to have; it is something that he aust have if he is ever to grow up. It is more than an essen- Hal part of his education; it is an essential part of the law of is growth, of the process by which he becomes a man at all.”

By Arruur Leann 
A. Tue Mranine or Pray anp CHIntpHoop 
1. Tue Brotocica, Tueory or Lire. The idea that man has been 
evolved in countless zeons of time through variation, unending experimen- 
tation and selection on the part of nature is now generally accepted as the 
true theory of life. To many, it may seem irreverent to think of God the 
Creator, as manifest in nature, creating, experimenting, judging and pre- 
serving the best and rejecting the inefficient and useless; but to many the 
developmental theory of life stands for the very essence of religion and 
faith. Is this not Immanuel, God with us! Are we not all part of nature 
and thus partakers in the evolution of the kingdom of heaven ? 
Biologists tell us that man is the product of lower forms of life, each of 
which has contributed its share to the grand total, then stagnated, while 
man, apparently the favored one, kept going on and on. 
We are also told that each individual passes through all the essential 
stages of growth which have preceded it. That both animals and man 
draw upon the life of the past, that they are created in the light of the accum- 
ulated experience of the race. That in order to attain the best development 
in the higher stages of life, all the earlier and lower reactions and experi- 
ences which have been valuable in race development must be passed through. 
2. Insrincr anp Trapition. These experiences and reactions have 
been crystallized in instincts and traditions for the benefit of future genera- 
19
-P-A-G-E-19
20 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRA ¥T 
tions. Many of the lower forms of life require no training or education, 
as they come into life fully equipped by instinct for all their struggles. 
but they never progress. 
‘As we ascend the scale of creation, we find life becoming incomplete 
at birth, requiring the care of a parent for protection and feeding. The 
higher and higher we rise, the more complex life becomes and the more 
helpless we find the infant, until we reach the human family, whose child 
is the most helpless of all and the least fitted by instinct to care for itself. 
But as compensation, the divinity of motherhood and fatherhood have 
been created to care for and train this helpless waif, until after spending 
one-third of its life in preparation for its duties, it is prepared to carry on 
alone its burden of the other two-thirds and help in the ever upward ascent. 
3. Tus Mranine or CartpHoop. The meaning of this is apparent, 
the more complex the life, the longer time required in preparation. Groos 
says the children play not because they are young but they are young in 
order that they may play. . 
_ Up to a certain point young animals and children have inherent 
impulses for self education. “The character and direction these impulses 
will take will depend upon environment and training. If the instincts of 
the child are to be directed to beneficent results, they require education. 
This education can be given through conscious and unconscious imitation 
in play of the things which the child sees going on about him. We see in 
this the need for proper environment, for the child becomes what he is 
through what he does, and he imitates what he sees. Under ideal condi- 
tions, it might not be necessary to have specialized play instruction, but 
where will we find ideal conditions? Certainly not in the crowded city 
nor in the country village, and it is doubtful if the beautiful country itself 
is free from some of the taint which hangs about the places before mentioned. 
‘We see then that play is nature’s short cut to experience; that it is the 
key which opens to the child the store house in which is treasured the ex- 
perience of the race. 
4. THE Enpvucationat Vauue or Instincr anp Piay. Groos says 
that “ play is activity without serious intent” and that “in child’s play 
opportunity is given through the exercise of inborn dispositions to strengthen 
and increase his inheritance in the acquisition of adaptations to his com- 
plicated environment; an achievement, which would be unattainable 
by instinct alone.” * In other words, through play guided by instinct, 
the child supplements his inheritance with a possibility of constant change 
in adaptation to environment. It is his adaptability which differentiates 
man from the lower animals. 
Tnstinct, however, is transitory. Any of you who were raised on a 
farm will know that if the calf is kept away from the cow it can be raised 
by hand and will never know what it is to obtain nourishment in the tradi- 
*” Play of Man,” page 2,

PLAY, CHILDHOOD AND THE PLAYGROUND 21 
tional manner. Incubator chickens do not know the call of the old hen, 
if they are kept away from her for a few days; so it is with most instincts. 
James, speaking of this quality of instinct says, “in all pedagogy, the great 
thing is to strike while the iron is hot, and to seize the wave of the pupils’ 
interest in each successive subject, before its ebb has come, so that knowl- 
edge may be got and a habit of skill acquired—a headway of interest, in 
short, secured, on which afterwards the individual may float. There is a 
happy time for fixing skill in drawing, for making boys collectors in natural 
history and presently dissectors and botanists.”* “The natural conclusion 
to draw from this transiency of instincts,” says James, “is that most in- 
stincts are implanted for the sake of giving rise to habits, and that this 
purpose once accomplished, have no raison d’étre in the physical economy 
and consequently fade away.” 
Childhood and youth then are the time for action; all the habits and 
reflexes which are to govern in later life must be formed during adolescence. 
The alluring call of instinct to play, moreover, must be heeded and obeyed 
at the proper time or like the water running through the mill dam, which 
is not harnessed to the wheel, it will be forever lost. Thus we see the plays 
of childhood have a definite pedagogical value, for through these plays, 
when taken advantage of, right life habits of physical, mental and moral 
reaction may be formed. We see that there is a time when children can 
learn to play ball, to throw, to jump, to dance, to handle tools and to train 
their imaginations. The infallible guide to the recognition of these times 
is the children’s desire and interest, when they are given free choice. There 
are times and seasons when children wish to play and must engage in cer- 
tain games and occupations in order to secure the nervous structure, mental 
and moral training which these pursuits are able to give, or they will be 
deficient all their lives in so far as these qualities have been necessary to 
the higher development of the race. 
Of course it may be possible, in some measure, to drive in some of 
these lessons by work and bitter experience. Possible but not probable. 
Play is the natural and easy method to knowledge, unhampered by the 
struggle for existence. 
The experience of a physical director of our acquaintance illustrates 
this point. When a child he cut the cords of two fingers on the left hand. 
This left a large tender scar just where the baseball is caught. It was im- 
possible to catch a hard ball without a heavily padded glove, which was 
financially impossible. In addition to this, undiscovered nearsightedness 
from birth made it impossible to judge the ball in catching. So not wishing 
to be “guyed,”’ baseball was a closed book. At the age of fourteen, the 
visual and financial difficulties were removed, but sensory adaptations and 
motor reactions required for judging distances and catching and throwing 
could not be learned. The time was past. Even after years of trying at 
school and elsewhere, it had to be given up as “a bad job.”

22 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
B. Tue Puace or THE PLaycrounp 
1. From Prayro Worx. While play is spontaneous, agreeable and 
without any motive other than the enjoyment it brings, we sce that it 
is also the most serious business of childhood. Children’s play does not 
pertain so largely to recreation as does the play of adults. When children 
play for recreation, they call it “jus’ foolin’.” 
It is this seriousness of children’s play which gives to it its educative 
value, for so surely as there is a time for each form of play. there is a time 
and method when play shades off into work. The true ideal of work is 
when it becomes art. Art often gives to the adult the stimulus for educa- 
tion and advancement, which the play instinct gives to the child. The 
child who has passed through the successive stages of play, which his 
nature demands, will take up work in the spirit of play when the proper 
time comes. Joseph Lee has well said, “the boy without a playground is 
father of the man without a job, and the boy also with a bad playground 
is the father of the man doing a job which shouldn’t be done.” ‘ 
_ The main connecting link between work and play is found in occupa- 
tions such as obtain in the kindergarten and in such occupations as are 
directed by the needs of the play instinct. ‘These activities suggest to chil- 
dren Something beyond mere play, but they are still play, and the manual 
training given on the playground should be such as to be kept always near the limits of play. An instance of a first class method of playground manual training comes from Australia—an account of an old woman’s 
direction of the occupation of young girls: “The old woman herself 
collected the material, built a skin hut and taught each of the little ones 
with great care to make small ones like the large model. She showed 
them where to get the gum and how to use it; she sent the girls to get 
rushes and taught them how to weave baskets over round stones,” ctc.* 
‘This is the type of constructive play which is and always will be applic- 
able to the playground. 
The hobbies of adults are similar to the play constructive activities 
of children. 
2. Tue Praycrounp anp THE Pray Direcror. For the children, 
the office of the playground is to provide the means for the exercise of the 
function of play, and the place of the play director is to know the require- 
ments of the child, and the possibilities of play and to guide these lessons of 
play so that the right form at the right time may be available; to lead the 
play activities of the child, so that the fullest and best expressions of each 
stage of development may be obtained; to continually raise the standards 
of the present stage and usher the child into new possibilities of play in 
accordance with the laws of growth. Thus we see that the playground’s 
duty to the child is educational; however, as the play element in teaching 
is made more and more an integral part of the school curriculum, the 
*8mith, “The Aborigines of Victoria,” Vol. I, page 50, cited by Groos’ “ Play of Man,” page 402.
-P-A-G-E-22
PLAY, CHILDHOOD AND THE PLAYGROUND 23 
office of the playground will be more and more to concern itself with public 
recreation. As Mr. DeGroot says, “Chicago suggests that our very inclu- 
sive term, ‘public playground,’ stands primarily not for swings and teeters, 
not for kindergarten and constructive work, not for gardening and nature 
study, and not for an orthodox educational policy, but rather for public 
recreation—a public education that has at one end the play of children and 
at the other end the relaxation of young men, young women and adults.” 
8. Tue PLayGRounD AND THE ScHOOL. Whatever the educational 
end which the playground has to serve, its educational mission must be 
carried on through the recreative end of play. The school has its place, 
which the playground cannot and should not attempt to usurp. The more 
of play and recreation which can be enthused into school work without 
defeating its aim, of giving a prescribed system of education adapted to the 
needs of all children, the better for our system of public schools. The 
attempt, however, to prescribe a system of educational play without abso- 
lute freedom for the child to choose just what he will play and what he won’t 
play is entirely foreign to our conception of a playground. We must pre- 
scribe our system to fit the child; if he accepts, it may be the right system, 
it may not be. Children might enjoy absolutely injurious and immoral 
plays. If, however, he won’t take our system, then the system must be 
modified until he will take it. 
The school and work, however, have a distinctive value in the educa- 
tion of the child, for at school one should learn to work and everything in 
life cannot be done in the spirit of play. Groos says “Among primitive 
races, where the life work is for the most part guided by nature, at least in 
the case of males, boys may get sufficient preparation from play for their 
later life, though even they usually have some instruction at the outset, 
but with civilized people, usage to earnest, persistent effort, that is not de- 
pendent upon caprice or impulse, is an indispensable condition of success 
in the struggle for life, and for this reason school life should promote a high 
sense of duty as opposed to mere inclination.” 
4. Lire. The standards of life are absolute in America. A man is 
successful or unsuccessful. He succeeds or he fails in whatever he under- 
takes, and the judgment of the world is harsh. We worship success. 
The standard of team games on the playground are also absolute. 
‘The boy makes the team if he can “deliver the goods.” In a hotly con- 
tested game of baseball if a wild throw is made, if inefficiency is shown it 
is not pardoned or condoned. “The plea that little Johnny did his best 
don’t go down on the play field.” In this the playground represents life 
and in this its purpose and raison d’étre is found. In the school if little 
Johnny fails he is passed up. In the home if little Johnny doesn’t do what he 
ought to do perhaps a little moral suasion serves the purpose. If little 
Johnny fails to get his Sunday school lesson or be a good boy God will 
forgive him, but if little Johnny cannot catch a “pop up” or is afraid to
-P-A-G-E-23
24 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
tackle a “hot liner” with bare hands his peers sit in judgment and the jury 
of equals pronounce the verdict, “Go play with the kids!” “ Give him 
the sack off the team!” 
This is reality and if we can enthuse into adult work the seriousness 
which is found in such play as this then it would be quite certain that the 
work of the world would be much better done. 
President Lowell in an article “Competition in College” suggests 
that play might be defined as activity which has as its end training for future 
usefulness. Such a definition of play seems to us to more fully meet the 
modern idea than that advanced by Groos. It leads us to the standpoint that 
play and education are the same. Oftentimes the “present enjoyment” 
may be prospective only, having place in the imagination. The drudg- 
ery and work of athletic training can be considered play only in this sense. 
Play of this character is on the border land of work and prepares for it. 
_ The professional man, the artist, the skilled artisan following a calling 
which is pleasing to him and in which his highest ability is called into play 
can pursue his work in this spirit especially if he is not oppressed by the 
shall and must of working for the necessities of life. 
5. Recreation ann Unsxmiep Lasor. But the great majority of pankind cannot be artists, nor professional men, nor skilled workers at 
Gat in itis stage of economic and mechanical development. The invention 
this ery doing away with exertions of physical strength in performing 
work is a step in this direction or a step in a process which tends to eliminate 
work and the hard struggle for existence. Instead of machinery being & 
curse to laboring man it is in reality a blessing for it enables him to do 
more work with the same expenditure of energy than was ever possible with 
hand made implements. And even though the running of a machine is 
drudgery and does not call into play the latent capabilities of a man’s talent 
nor give exercise to his imagination, it can and will make all life easier when 
the proper adjustments between capital and labor are made. This work, 
however, must be supplemented by an amount of recreation which will 
add to the worker’s life the elements which machine labor does not inspire 
or instill and which have been valuable in the development of the race. 
A system of recreation must supply these needs. As work, back-breaking 
work, is diminished, play must be increased, for the adult as well as the 
child. The tendencies and directions which adult recreation will take can 
be determined by the play interests which are formed in childhood. The 
elements of play can be enthused into work oftentimes by means of com- 
petition, When we were boys, we all know how much easier it was to pick 
up rocks, or to hoe to the end of the row, if another boy was alongside try- 
ing to see who could get there first. We all remember how Tom Sawyer 
got his fence whitewashed. The same thing is true when the men in the 
shop try to see who can varnish the most boxes in a day, or see who can 
run the greatest number of spindles through a machine. Piece work of 
course is the only kind of work to which this principle can be applied.

PLAY, CHILDHOOD AND THE PLAYGROUND 25 
6. Wy Recreation SHOULD BE Provivep at Pusiic ExpEnse.* 
Public recreation should be provided first for economic reasons, for the 
same reasons which make us provide public schools, public streets, public 
sewers, etc.; second for sociological reasons. If recreation is not provided 
by the public for the public, it will be provided by private interests for 
personal, commercial and selfish ends. 
Our cities have been built with an absolute disregard for the child. 
The beauties of nature, and that close association with mother earth, 
which is so valuable to healthful childish growth, has been left out. There 
is no space or incentive for physical exercise. The city lacks trees for the 
children to climb, sand banks for them to jump from, water for wading 
and swimming. There are no wood piles to saw, no animals to take care 
of, to train or domesticate, no chores to do, no regular duties which must 
be performed and no responsibilities which lead to growth. There are no 
work shops with tools lying around handy, with which the children can cut 
their fingers, and make bird houses, sleds, bows and arrows, wind-mills, 
water-wheels. The parents work in shops where the children are not al- 
lowed to go. “No admittance” signs appear wherever the child could 
learn anything useful; “Keep off the grass” signs on every green spot. 
With no chance for imitation to exercise itself in legitimate ways, the child 
naturally imitates things which he should not. As the children of the city 
grow to young manhood and young womanhood, their amusements are 
commercialized with sad results. Society to protect and preserve itself 
must provide healthful play and recreation which the city has crowded out. 
The country lacks many things also. The training of the farm has 
produced a type of individualistic ability, which has accomplished much. 
Tt does not, however, develop coGperation, or the ability to work together 
with other individuals. The “social unrest,” the differences between 
capital and labor, and by far most of the ills caused by city life are due to this 
individualistic attitude of the leaders and capitalists which country life 
has developed. 
The beginning of a new era is at hand, an era of competition for 
codperation. ‘The leaders will now come from the city rather than from 
the country; in fact the regeneration of the country must come from the 
city, for the best blood of the country has built up the city. The unfavor- 
able conditions of country life have been discussed at length recently, and 
are so serious that President Roosevelt appointed a Country Life Commis- 
sion to investigate. Through the play of children the unfavorable condi- 
tions of both city and country life may be remedied most easily. It will 
be extremely difficult to change the settled ways of the population in our 
small villages and country towns in any other way. When we can bring 
more of the country to the city and more of the city to the country, the life 
in both places will be greatly improved.

CHAPTER II 
Turortrs or Piay* 
1. Tue Surptus Exercy Turory. In order to explain the phe- 
nomena of play, various theories have been advanced; the first of these 
propounded by Spencer is that man and animals are endowed with more 
energy than is required in the struggle for existence. “I'his allows some of 
their powers periods of rest, while others are being exercised, and they 
work off their surplus energy by means of play. This theory explains some 
of the conditions of play, but play is sometimes engaged in by creatures 
when they are so tired as to preclude the possibility of there being much 
surplus energy stored up. It does not explain the recreation of adults. 
@. Tue Recreation Tueory. Another theory advanced is that 
play is exercised when the body is tired, for the purpose of recreation. 
This theory has its most scientific champion in Lazarus. Simply stated, 
it is that when we are tired of mental or physical labor and do not wish 
to sleep or rest, play furnishes welcome and active recreation. The change 
from one form of activity to another rests the powers which have been 
exercised. This theory does not explain the fact that after play is started, 
Tepetition causes its continuation long after the period of rest. Children 
will absolutely lose themselves in present enjoyment, when they strike the 
right combination, They sometimes keep up until exhausted. Baldwin 
has emphasized this point. These theories of play explain some of the 
phenomena but do not explain everything. 
8. Tux Biotocican Tuzory. Darwin contends that play is biologi- 
cal; that our ancestors spent their time fighting, experimenting, hunting, or- 
ganizing, ete., and accordingly in us the impulses to fighting, chasing, social 
and other plays are clearly shown. Darwin’s theory of natural selection has 
been disputed, authorities differing in regard to whether acquired character- 
istics are inherited or not. Baldwin has amended the biological theory 
by what is called “organic selection” and Weismann by his germinal 
selection theory, According to the former, the inheritance of acquired 
accommodations is unnecessary, their object being sufficiently accomplished, 
if they keep the creature afloat in their environment until natural selection 
has had time to build up hereditary adaptations. Weismann transfers 
selection into a struggle of germ substance (the determinants) which repre- 
sent the respective parts of the future individual. Each “determinant” 
struggles for sustenance against its neighbor, so producing a sort of germ- 
inal selection, the stronger elements developing at the expense of the 
weaker and the force so acquired being transmitted to the offspring, with 
a favorable footing in the struggle for life which insures further progress 
in the same direction.

THEORIES OF PLAY Qt 
4. Tue Psycuorocican Sranppornr. The psychological explana- 
tion of play advanced by Wundt is that an animal ean play only when cer- 
tain memories which are accompanied by pleasurable feelings are renewed, 
yet under aspects so transformed that all painful effects vanish and only 
agreeable ones remain; thus when a young dog seizes a piece of cloth, 
shaking it violently in its teeth, such play exhibits the playful activity of 
former generations. The standpoint seems to explain the attraction to 
children of playing in the water, and for many, fighting, hunting and dra- 
matic plays. The pleasures of play when analyzed from the psychological 
standpoint seem to be brought about through the exercise of attention, 
the demand for a sufficient cause and imagination. The first of these 
items seems to be present with us from infancy. 
The desire to be an efficient cause has both a motor and a theoretic 
form; we demand a knowledge of experimental effects, and we desire our- 
selves to be producers of effects, and through reproducing, the original 
idea is perfected. 
In many games, there is a veritable playing of a role, for example 
when children represent different animals. It is quite probable that in 
this play they feel many of the emotions which obtained in the animals 
which they represent. When children play being chased by a bear, they, 
for the time being, seem to feel much of the fear which the aboriginal man 
might have felt. Much of the pleasure of golf can be explained in this way, 
for when looked at logically, what pleasure can be obtained. from knocking 
a little ball over a ten acre lot and then chasing it up and knocking it into a 
little hole! 
5. Tux Esrueric Sranppornr. There is also an esthetic value 
to play, which is especially prominent in the development of music, poetry 
and art. The first thing with which it is concerned is in the transferrence 
of thought from a copy to an original. The children’s artistic efforts, their 
imitations of singing, drawing, ete., are essentially playful. The primitive 
festival, combining as it did music and poetry with dancing, had a tre- 
mendous effect upon its witnesses and was in its manifestations essentially 
playful. When this ssthetic development of play is pursued to produce a 
pleasurable effect on others rather than as an end in itself, it becomes art. 
6. Socronocrcan Vatun. Play has a sociological value. The union 
of early tribes for their dances and feasts made it possible for them to work 
together for serious purposes and the best way now to secure codperation 
seems to be through community of interest in plays and recreation. 
7. PrepasocicaL Vatu. The pedagogical standpoint of play, we 
have already dwelt upon. Groos says in completing his treatise on play, 
“finally it should be emphasized that the beautiful task of play, the develop- 
ment of the individual to full manhood or womanhood by means of an 
all-round exercise of his or her capabilities is retarded by restriction to one 
particular form of play.” 
A complete explanation of play no doubt will be found in a combina- 
tion of all of these theories and others which have not yet been discovered,

CHAPTER III 
Tur Conrrrsution or tHE Norta American InpIaN TO THE PLay- 
crounD MoveMENT 
Some one has said “a child’s brain is like a flower, that blossoms in 
perceptions and goes to seed in abstractions. Correct concepts are the 
raw material of reason. Every desk in your school is an intellectual loom, 
which is expected to weave a sound fabric out of rotten raw material.” 
The life of the savage depended upon his correct interpretation of 
natural phenomena, consequently the children were taught to see, to ob- 
serve, and to interpret nature about them. 
When man became civilized, many things were lost. Chief among 
these seems to be the ability to properly educate and interpret childhood. 
Living as civilized people do, less by instinct than do the less highly civilized 
races, our reasons have been running away with our instincts. 
One of the primary instincts is the proper care and training of chil- 
dren, It is our opinion that the average boy belonging to the Sioux Indian 
tribe was better educated to fit the conditions with which he had to cope 
than is the average product of our present much boasted civilization. In 
the race after the material things of civilization we have forgotten some of 
the essentials. 
As a nation we are self-indulgent and we raise our children too tenderly 
and indulgently. This nation was not founded on “soft snaps” or “easy 
jobs.” Well-regulated hardship is a splendid character builder. 
Furthermore, our children are not taught to learn facts by observation 
during childhood; consequently, they enter adult life unprepared, It is just 
as important for the city child to read the signs of the times and learn to take 
care of himself under present conditions, as it was for the Indian to read 
the signs of the forest. Observation and interpretation of natural phe- 
nomena seems to be the first step in the education of correct reasoning. 
Dr. Charles A. Eastman (Ohiyesa) has kindly permitted us to use some 
chapters from “Indian Boyhood,” which we think apply in full measure 
to the present educational dilemma. There are many things about man- 
hood which the Indian can teach our boys and our men, and many of the 
things may apply to the girls as well.

Selections Reprinted from “Indian Boyhood,” by Permission.* 
It is commonly supposed that there is no systematic education of their 
children among the aborigines of this country. Nothing could be farther 
from the truth. All the customs of this primitive people were held to be 
divinely instituted, and those in connection with the training of children 
were scrupulously adhered to and transmitted from one generation to an- 
other. 
The expectant parents conjointly bent all their efforts to the task of 
giving the newcomer the best they could gather from a long line of ancestors. 
A pregnant Indian woman would often choose one of the greatest charac- 
ters of her family and tribe as a model for her child. This hero was daily 
called to mind. She would gather from tradition all of his noted deeds and 
daring exploits, rehearsing them to herself when alone. In order that the 
impression might be more distinct, she avoided company. She isolated 
herself as much as possible, and wandered in solitude, not thoughtlessly, 
but with an eye to the impress given by grand and beautiful scenery. 
The Indians believed, also, that certain kinds of animals would confer 
peculiar gifts upon the unborn, while others would leave so strong an ad- 
verse impression that the child might become a monstrosity. A case of 
hare-lip was commonly attributed to the rabbit. It was said that a rabbit 
had charmed the mother and given to the babe its own features. Even the 
meat of certain animals was denied the pregnant woman, because it was 
supposed to influence the disposition or features of the child. 
Scarcely was the embryo warrior ushered into the world, when he was 
met by lullabies that speak of wonderful exploits in hunting and war. 
Those ideas which so fully occupied his mother’s mind before his birth are 
now put into words by all about the child, who is as yet quite unresponsive 
to their appeals to his honor and ambition. He is called the future defender 
of his people, whose lives may depend upon his courage and skill. If the 
child is a girl, she is at once addressed as the future mother of a noble race. 
In hunting songs, the leading animals are introduced: they come to 
the boy to offer their bodies for the sustenance of his tribe. The animals 
are regarded as his friends, and spoken of almost as tribes of people, or as 
his cousins, grandfathers and grandmothers. ‘The songs of wooing, adapted 
as lullabies, were equally imaginative, and the suitors were often animals 
personified, while pretty maidens were represented by the mink and the 
oe.

30 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
Very early, the Indian boy assumed the task of preserving and trans- 
mitting the legends of his ancestors and his race. Almost every evening 
a myth, or a true story of some deed done in the past, was narrated by one 
of the parents or grandparents, while the boy listened with parted lips and 
glistening eyes. On the following evening, he was usually required to re- 
peat it. If he was not an apt scholar, he struggled long with his task; but, 
as a rule, the Indian boy is a good listener and has a good memory, so that 
the stories were tolerably well mastered. The household became his audi- 
ence, by which he was alternately criticized and applauded. 
This sort of teaching at once enlightens the boy’s mind and stimulates 
his ambition. His conception of his own future career becomes a vivid and 
irresistible force. Whatever there is for him to learn must be learned; what- 
ever qualifications are necessary to a truly great man he must seek at any 
expense of danger and hardship. Such was the feeling of the imaginative 
and brave young Indian. It became apparent to him in early life that he 
must accustom himself to rove alone and not to fear or dislike the impres- 
sion of solitude. 
Tt seems to be a popular idea that all the characteristic skill of the 
Indian is instinctive and hereditary. This is a mistake. All the stoicism 
and patience of the Indian are acquired traits, and continual practice alone 
makes him master of the art of woodcraft. Physical training and dieting 
were not neglected. I remember that I was not allowed to have beef soup 
or any warm drink. The soup was for the old men. General rules for the 
young were never to take their food very hot nor to drink much water. 
, My uncle, who educated me up to the age of fifteen vears, was a strict 
disciplinarian and a good teacher. When I left the teepee in the morning 
he would say: “Hakadah, look closely to everything you see;” and at 
evening, on my return, he used often to catechize me for an hour or so. 
_. “On which side of the trees is the lighter-colored bark? On which 
side do they have most regular branches ?” 
___ It was his custom to Jet me name all the new birds that I had seen dur- 
ing the day. I would name them according to the color or the shape of 
the bill, or their song,, or the appearance and locality of the nest—-in fact 
anything about the bird that impressed me as characteristic. I made 
many ridiculous errors, I must admit. He then usually informed me of 
the correct name. Occasionally I made a hit and this he would warmly 
commend. 
He went much deeper into this science when I was a little older, that 
is, about the age of eight or nine years. He would say, for instance: 
“How do you know that there are fish in yonder lake ?” 
“Because they jump out of the water for flies at midday.” 
He would smile at my prompt but superficial reply. 
“What do you think of the little pebbles grouped together under the 
shallow water, and what made the pretty curved marks in the sandy
-P-A-G-E-30
THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIAN AND THE PLAYGROUND 31 
bottom and the little sand-banks ? Where do you find the fish-eating birds ? 
Have the inlet and the outlet of a lake anything to do with the question ?” 
He did not expect a correct reply at once to all the voluminous ques- 
tions that he put to me on these occasions, but he meant to make me observ- 
ant and a good student of nature. 
“Hakadah,” he would say to me, “you ought to follow the example of 
the shunktokecha (wolfy. Even when he is surprised and runs for his life, 
he will pause to take one more look at you before he enters his final retreat. 
So you must take a second look at everything you see. 
“Tt is better to view animals unobserved. I have been a witness to 
their courtships and their quarrels and have learned many of their secrets 
in this way. I was once the unseen spectator of a thrilling battle between 
a pair of grizzly bears and three buffaloes—a rash act for the bears, for it 
was in the moon of strawberries, when the buffaloes sharpen and polish 
their horns for bloody contests among themselves. 
“T advise you, my boy, never to approach a grizzly’s den from the 
front but to steal up behind and throw your blanket or a stone in front of 
the hole for he does not usually rush for it, but first puts his head out and 
listens and then comes out very indifferently and sits on his haunches on 
the mound in front of the hole before he makes any attack. While he is 
exposing himself in this fashion aim at his heart. Always be as cool as 
the animal himself.” Thus he armed me against the cunning of savage 
beasts by teaching me how to outwit them. 
“Tn hunting,” he would resume, “you will be guided by the habits of 
the animal you seek. Remember that a moose stays in swampy or low 
land or between high mountains near a spring or lake, from thirty to sixty 
days at a time. Most large game moves about continually, except the doe 
in the spring; it is then a very easy matter to find her with the fawn. Con- 
ceal yourself in a convenient place as soon as you observe any signs of the 
presence of either, and then call with your birchen doe-caller. 
“Whichever one hears you first will soon appear in your neighborhood. 
But you must be watchful or you may be made a fawn of by a large wild- 
cat. They understand the characteristic call of the doe perfectly well. 
“When you have any difficulty with a bear or a wild-cat—that is, if 
the creature shows signs of attacking you—you must make him fully under- 
stand that you have seen him and are aware of his intentions. If you are 
not well equipped for a pitched battle, the only way to make him retreat 
is to take a long sharp-pointed pole for a spear and rush toward him. No 
wild beast will face this unless he is cornered and already wounded. These 
fierce beasts are generally afraid of the common weapon of the larger 
animals—the horns, and if these are very long and sharp, they dare not risk 
an open fight. 
“There is one exception to this rule—the grey wolf will attack fiercely 
when very hungry. But their courage depends upon their numbers; in 
this they are like white men. One wolf or two will never attack a man.
-P-A-G-E-31
32 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
They will stampede a herd of buffaloes in order to get at the calves; they 
will rush upon a herd of antelopes, for these are helpless; but they are 
always careful about attacking man.” 
Of this nature were the instructions of my uncle, who was widely 
known at that time as among the greatest hunters of his tribe. 
All boys were expected to endure hardship without complaint. In 
savage warfare, a young man must, of course, be an athlete and used to 
undergoing all sorts of privations. He must be able to go without food 
and water for two or three days without displaying any weakness, or to 
run for a day and night without any rest. He must be able to traverse a 
pathless and wild country without losing his way either, in the day or night 
time. He cannot refuse to do any of these things if he aspires to be a warrior. 
Sometimes my uncle would waken me very early in the morning and 
challenge me to fast with him all day. I had to accept the challenge. We 
blackened our faces with charcoal, so that every boy in the village would 
know that I was fasting for the day. Then the little tempters would make 
my life a misery until the merciful sun hid behind the western hills. 
I can scarcely recall the time when my stern teacher began to give 
sudden war-whoops over my head in the morning while I was sound asleep. 
He expected me to leap up with perfect presence of mind, always ready to 
grasp @ weapon of some sort and to give a shrill whoop in reply. If I was 
sleepy or startled and hardly knew what I was about, he would ridicule 
me and say that I need never expect to sell my scalp dear. Often he would 
vary these tactics by shooting off his gun just outside of the lodge while 
I was yet asleep, at the same time giving blood-curdling yells. After a 
time I became used to this. “ When Indians went upon the war-path, it was their custom to try the 
new warriors thoroughly before coming to an engagement. For instance, 
when they were near a hostile camp, they would select the novices to go 
after the water and make them do all sorts of things to prove their courage. 
In accordance with this idea, my uncle used to send me off after water 
when we camped after dark in a strange place. Perhaps the country was 
full of wild beasts, and, for aught I knew, there might be scouts from hos- 
tile bands of Indians lurking in that very neighborhood. 
Yet I never objected, for that would show cowardice. I picked my 
way through the woods, dipped my pail in the water and hurried back, 
always careful to make as little noise as a cat. Being only a boy, my heart 
would leap at every crackling of a dry twig or distant hooting of an owl, 
until, at last, I reached our teepee. Then my uncle would perhaps say: 
“Ah, Hakadah, you are a thorough warrior,” empty out the precious 
contents of the pail, and order me to go a second time. 
Imagine how I felt. But I wished to be a brave man as much as a 
white boy desires to be a great lawyer or even President of the United 
States. Silently I would take the pail and endeavor to retrace my foot- 
steps in the dark,
-P-A-G-E-32
THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIAN AND THE PLAYGROUND 33 
With all this, our manners and morals were not neglected. I was made 
to respect the adults and especially the aged. I was not allowed to join in 
their discussions, nor even to speak in their presence, unless requested to 
do so. Indian etiquette was very strict, and among the requirements was 
that of avoiding the direct address. A term of relationship or some title 
of courtesy was commonly used instead of the personal name by those 
who wished to show respect. We were taught generosity to the poor and 
reverence for the “Great Mystery.’ Religion was the basis of all Indian 
training. 
I recall to the present day some of the kind warnings and reproofs that 
my good grandmother was wont to give me. “Be strong of heart—be 
patient,” she used to say. She told me of a young chief who was noted 
for his uncontrollable temper. While in one of his rages he attempted to 
kill a woman, for which he was slain by his own band and left unburied 
as a mark of disgrace—his body was simply covered with green grass. If 
T ever lost my temper, she would say: 
“Wakadah, control yourself, or you will be like that young man I told 
you of, and lie under a Green Blanket.” 
In the old days, no young man was allowed to use tobacco in any 
form until he had become an acknowledged warrior and had achieved a 
record. If a youth should seek a wife before he had reached the age of 
twenty-two or twenty-three, and been recognized as a brave man, he was 
sneered at and considered an ill-bred Indian. He must also be a skilful 
hunter. An Indian cannot be a good husband unless he brings home 
plenty of game. 
These precepts were in the line of our training for the wild life. 
“Men grow old because they stop playing, and not con- 
versely, for play is, at bottom, growth.” 
“The sentiments on which the highest religion rests are 
best trained in children on the noblest objects of nature.” 
—G. Stanley Hall.

CHAPTER IV 
Tur PLaycrounp As A Puase or SocraL RerorM 
A. “Tus City Boy” 
We wish to introduce to you a strange creature. It resists classification 
and analysis. It has a tousled mat of indifferent colored hair surmounting 
a defiant freckled face. Water it abhors except in ponds full. When it 
comes in the house, chairs and bric-a-brac fall over, the limbs are too Jong 
for the body and the clothes are too short for the limbs. If it tries to talk 
the voice sometimes goes up and sometimes goes down. Taken all together 
it is not ornamental or particularly useful. The abode of civilization is no 
place for it. Its habitation is the woods and fields; its natural occupation 
hunting, fishing and fighting. It imagines itself an Indian and belongs to a 
tribe who go on plundering expeditions against its enemies. It wants to be 
a cowboy or a hunter and kill bears. A year ago this wild animal was a 
well-behaved, studious boy, a model in the school and the home; now we 
don’t know what to call him. All the emotions of manhood are stirring 
and budding within the veins of this irresponsible boy. Before, he was @ 
member of the family thinking what they thought was law; now he must 
find out for himself. 
Nature at certain periods wishes her processes to operate free from 
outside interference. So at this time she puts up a fence and says to the 
parents, “hands off, you have had your time; the boy will not forget all 
the home teachings; now he is mine and I shall add certain stern, barbaric 
virtues of truth, devotion, strength, patriotism, loyalty and self-sacrifice 
which can be attained only by my method.” If we were all living according 
to natural conditions we need take no further trouble about the boy, but 
while nature furnishes the instinct we take the boy out of his natural en- 
vironment. Nothing is more pathetic than the lot of the city boy. He lives 
in a flat or tenement. He can’t play in the house, and probably wouldn’t 
if he could. There is no yard. If he plays ball in the streets, he is promptly 
arrested. Whenever he finds a vacant lot and fixes up a baseball diamond 
or a skating rink, in a few months a building goes up. All the while these 
instincts are surging within him demanding expression. No wonder he 
turns and demands his rights. If he is not furnished with a playground 
adequate for his needs he will make a playground of the streets and lawns 
of the neighborhood. 
No truer heart beats than that under the jacket of the adolescent boy. 
He hates his enemies with a bitter hatred and loves his friends and wor- 
ships his ideals with a fervor that exists in no one else. I am reminded 
of a circumstance in my own life. I was a “kid” myself not so very long ago

and got into a scrape at school; the offense was shooting off fire-crackers 
in the hall, with some others. They used to call us “the gang.” It looked 
as if some of us would go home. One day at chapel after the matter had 
been investigated the father of the president arose and made a plea for the 
boys. He said, “Have you noticed a tadpole, with four legs and a tail ? 
Now we can see no earthly use for that tail, but cut it off and the tadpole 
dies; that’s just the way with the boy; sometimes we don’t see the use of 
the fool things he does, but they seem to be as necessary to his life as the 
extra tail is to the life of the tadpole.” 
The playground people at Omaha have the right idea. They have 
done more for the money invested than any other city we know of. The 
following shows how their ideas have “soaked in:” 
“‘Few prouder boys could be found anywhere in the country than those who were 
recently used by detectives in Omaha, to assist in the arrest of some train-robbers. One 
of the boys pulled a leather steing from a pile of rubbish in a vacant lot, and found an auto- 
matic pistol at the end of it. He discovered burglars’ tools also, and told the police. The 
police concluded that the robbers would come back to the rubbish pile to get their property, 
and had the boys play in the neighborhood, and keep watch for strangers. If any appeared 
one boy was to leave the game and telephone to the police station. ‘The plan worked sue- 
cessfully, and those accused of the robberies were arrested.” —Youth’s Companion. 
Mrs. Heller’s paper, “The Playground as a Phase of Social Reform,” 
tells Omaha’s play philosophy. It is published in the Proceedings of the 
Playground Association of America, 1908. ‘The following is a syllabus:

B. Tue Neep or ATHLETICS FoR GIRLS 
By Mrs. Cuaries F. WELLER 
Mrs. Charles F. Weller, who for five years was Head President of 
Neighborhood House in Washington, has the following to say in regard to 
athletics for girls: 
More and more it is being realized that it is the girls who need the play- 
grounds, and that they must be influenced to attend in greater numbers. 
Everybody accepts playgrounds for boys, and the neighborhood thinks 
them quite the proper place for their boys, but, somehow, for girls, why, 
that’s different. Now, if anybody needs fresh air and sunshine it is the girl 
between twelve and twenty years of age, but she is told that it is unladylike 
and immodest to run and jump and play generally. Sometimes she ventures 
on the playgrounds in a freshly laundered dress, plays ten or fifteen minutes 
with the result that the dress is again ready for the tub and there are more 
disparaging remarks about the playgrounds from already overburdened
-P-A-G-E-35
36 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
mothers. Why not change the dress for the gymnasium suit while on the 
playgrounds? It will be found far more comfortable, economical and 
modest. There is, however, among the parents, an unreasonable prejudice 
against the gymnasium suit for girls, yet the same people who protest 
against the gymnasium suit for playground wear accept without protest 
the bathing suit for the public beach. 
It is generally agreed, I think, that free but supervised play gives that 
joy and relief from restraint that is every child’s birthright, physical relaxa- 
tion and upbuilding, and moral development through good fellowship and 
a growing sense of fair play. 
If this is necessary for boys, surely it is much more so for girls. Girls, 
much more than their brothers, are bound down early in life by the respon- 
sibilities of home, are restrained from action and self-expression by foolish 
conventionality, are trained early to be vain and self-conscious and are 
cramped and narrowed to the end by the straitened limits of their necessary 
activities and by the artificial bonds of senseless traditions. How many 
women of twenty-five have retained any of the litheness and elasticity of 
their childhood? How many can take long walks without exhaustion or 
keep strength and breath under control in climbing a slight ascent? It 
would be foolish to ignore certain physiologieal differences between men 
and women or to disregard individual weaknesses, but surely women are 
not a race of invalids who must be inactive and let their muscles soften with 
disuse. To women, as not to men, there come sometimes the crises when 
muscular strength and sounder power mean the enduring of suffering, 
mean even life itself. Surely the coming generation would be stronger 
and sounder if every woman would keep in active control her physical 
powers. 
It seems evident that the hysterical enthusiasm for physical efficiency 
in women which showed itself a few years since, perhaps excessively at 
times, in the popularity of the “athletic girl” has already met the reaction. 
But must the pendulum sway back too far? Because boys have killed them- 
selves by over-exertion during the late “Marathon Race,” should we 
say, “away with athletics for boys?” It has been one of the jests of the 
ages that in the larger relations of life women are narrow, short-sighted and 
mean. Yet we know that where under modern conditions they have been 
given freedom and broadening influences, they have been a powerful force 
in philanthropic and civic movements and have exemplified in public life 
those qualities of sympathy and self-sacrifice that are the traditional virtues 
of the hearthstone. So, if, as has often been said, the playground is a force 
in developing citizenship, its benefits are needed most by the girl whose 
horizon may be narrowed some day by the close boundaries of her own home 
and whose opportunities for discipline through contact with many people 
and varying conditions may be but few. 
Another fault that the literature of all ages has attributed to women is 
“vanity.” Can we deny that the point is well taken? But whose the blame?
-P-A-G-E-36
THE PLAYGROUND AS A PHASE OF SOCIAL REFORM 37 
Has not society always taught girls to be self-conscious? Have not self- 
adornment and personal beauty ranked far higher among feminine than 
among masculine virtues? Many a girl borne down by false ideals flings 
her honor and her happiness on the altar of the God of Beauty. Were it 
not for the counteracting influence of that other one-sided tradition which 
puts social purity higher in the scale of conduct for women than for men, 
the number of girls sacrificed to this false standard would be much greater 
than it is. 
For all these unhealthful influences there could be no better counter- 
irritant than wholesome, vigorous, self-immersing play. For girls whose 
lives have been cast in places sordid and impure, who have heard and seen 
and done much that it were well to cast out from their memories, no gentle, 
“ladylike” games, no dances, with their accompaniment of sense-stirring 
music, their calculated grace and studied pose has power to exorcise the 
demon that has possessed them. It needs active, vigorous play like a strong 
wind to sweep away the impurities and to drive out, for a time, the thought 
of self and the instinct for personal charm. 
At a large reformatory one summer not many years ago, all the girls, 
to their unconcealed delight, were organized into baseball nines. ‘They 
played, oh, how they did play! The very force that had made them defy 
society and transgress the law was turned into a masterful physical courage, 
so that they went down in the dust and struggled up again, fell and had 
determination to “still rise up and sail right onward.” Scratched, dis- 
heveled, bedraggled, they were not beautiful to see. But the prettiest of 
them and the most sensual—for many of them were both—must have 
tasted for those few moments the purest joy of their physical being. 
“One former is worth one hundred reformers.” 
—Horace Mann. 
*We have no sense of responsibility in regard to the pleas- 
ures of young people and continually forget that amusement 
is stronger than vice and that it alone can stifle the lust for 
it. We see all about us much vice which is merely a love for 
leasure ‘gone wrong,’ the illicit expression of what might 
Pave been not only normal and recreative pleasure, but an 
instrument in the advance of higher social morality.” 
—Jane Addams.

PLAYGROUNDS AND DELINQUENCY 
A. Pupuic PLaycRounDs aND JUVENILE DeLinqueNcy* 
By Jupce Ben B. Lixpsey 
_ Judge Lindsey is the originator of the whole Juvenile Court system of the United States and has 
an international reputation as an authority on juvenile delinquency. He now presides over the Juve- 
nile Court of Denver, Col. In connection with his court he has organized the Little Citizens’ League, 
which puts boys on their honor, and whose records show that only three boys out of several hundreds 
have betrayed their trust. He succeeded in getting the Colorado Legislature to enact a law pun- 
ishing peeligent arents, eraployés. etc. He was the Democratic candidate for Governor of Colorado 
in 1906, and is the author of “Problems of the Children.” Editor. 
The great majority of that part of our so-called criminal class who 
are caught and confined are from the youth of the nation. I believe that 
the police and the courts are concerned with the lawlessness of more than 
a hundred thousand children every year in the citizens of this country, 
and that means a million in each generation of childhood. 
We cannot overdraw the picture of the increase in weakness and crime 
among the youth in the cities of this republic. It is not their fault; it is 
ours. It is largely due to that environment, to that condition that we have 
created. It is not pretended that any one remedy will suffice, but no one 
remedy proposed can be more serviceable than the public playground. 
Perhaps the saddest thing in my experience is the cursing of heartless 
parents that I have heard from the lips of neglected boys and girls. 
Christ said of him who would do an injury to one of these little ones 
that “It were better that a mill-stone be hanged about his neck and he be 
cast into the sea.” We do an injury to these little ones just so far as we 
neglect to provide those agencies for their development and protection. 
Just so far as by lack of interest we compel our school boards to put fifty 
children in a room where there shouldn’t be over twenty, deny a trade 
school to equip for industrial efficiency and a playground to equip the child 
for the advantages of the school and life beyond. It is no longer questioned 
that such agencies do more to prevent crime than jails, courts and policemen. 
We must not encourage the parent to shirk. Starting in Colorado 
about six years ago we established a new offense in this country. It is called 
contributory delinquency or dependency. It is spreading all over this 
country. Under these laws the State is exacting of the parent, where the 
parent is responsible, a more positive responsibility for the moral ‘and 
physical welfare of the child. The parent who shirks may be punished. 
Justice demands that this responsibility be extended to all persons who 
might properly share it. We may all become guilty just so far as we fail 
to strengthen those whom we have burdened with this responsibility. 
That strength depends upon our support of these agencies, such as school

PLAYGROUNDS AND DELINQUENCY 39 
boards, park boards, ete., to provide the equipment necessary to give the 
child a square deal through the public playground and the school. 
One obstacle to the public playground has been the cost. If the aver- 
age citizen, if the average business man, if you please, would only wake 
to the fact that the most economic scheme for handling the problem of 
crime is that which prevents rather than that which at fearful expense is 
merely the engine to convict and punish after crime has become an estab- 
lished fact, we could make progress faster. Because the actual return in 
dollars is more or less invisible it is difficult for some people to see the 
necessity for public playgrounds. ‘They have as little sense of real values 
as that boy whom I induced to go to Sunday school. He said, “It’s a 
place where all the little kids go and give up a penny and don’t get anything 
back.” He was thinking of the substantial stick of candy he got at the cor- 
ner grocery for that precious penny. When asked if he hadn’t learned 
anything there he said, “I learned about angels, I did. I learned they had 
wings just like the chickens, but I didn’t learn whether they laid eggs or 
not.” One of the pitiful things of the past has been our confusion in deal- 
ing with the problem of crime. 
Thomas Carlyle said there is a gregarious or sheep-like tendency in 
mankind to flock together and have a leader, and this tendency is first 
manifested in childhood. And this, of course, means the game—it means 
play. You cannot keep children from flocking together; neither should 
you. The responsible parent who thinks to solve the problem by keeping 
the boy away from his fellows is more likely to develop a mollycoddle or 
a milksop. He is frequently denied association with others, because that 
means the street. Let us provide a better place than the street for his 
playground. We want wholesome, vigorous citizens, with rich, red blood 
in their veins. They are to be recruited alone from our children. Let 
them mix with others, and learn to face and overcome the difficulties that 
come from the mixing, as well as to reap the joys and pleasures of the in- 
stinct to flock together, to play together. Our duty, then, is not to suppress, 
but to afford under the best environment the State can provide, the oppor- 
tunity for wholesome association and helpful expression of natural instincts. 
It is only the thoughiless and uninformed who indifferently wave aside 
these important problems with the suggestion that the children of the past 
did not require such consideration. It is no answer to our demand for the 
public playground to say that all that is needed is the occasional vacant lot 
for the boy in the city. It is as absurd as to argue that because the boy of 
fifty years ago on the farm in this country was not in need of child labor 
laws such legislation is not necessary under present conditions. Even this 
vacant lot, either with or without a trespass sign, is passing away with the 
old swimming hole. If it exists its joys are mingled with the terrors of the 
policeman, “ Keep off the grass,” the broken window, the grouchy neighbor 
and the dangers that come from the energy that is misdirected through 
suppression and lack of wise direction. Our plea for public playgrounds
-P-A-G-E-39
40 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
is a plea for justice to the boy. We are literally crowding hiss off the 
earth. We have no right to deny him his heritage, but that is just what 
we are doing in nearly every large city in this country; but he is hitting back 
and hitting hard, when he doesn’t mean to, while we vaguely understand 
and stupidly punish him for crime. Why shouldn’t he rebel? “I'he amaz- 
ing thing is that he is not worse than he is. 
Perhaps the boy needs to be taught where fun ends and the law begins, 
but his struggle for fun and adventure is met all along the line from the 
little seven-year old, who tries to reach the door-knocker of the neighbor's 
house, when the minister coming along lifted the little fellow up. He 
gave it a whang and a bang, and shocked the good-man as he scouted down 
the street as hard as his little legs could carry him, only to turn and shout 
to his friend, “Hey, Mister, you’d better run like the devil, or you'll get 
caught.” We must know where to meet this boy and how to understand 
him; and in teaching him where fun ends and the law begins we must have 
due regard both for his fun, his exercise, his bubbling energies and the 
law. Ihave found that when we do that he is the noblest little creature 
in the world. He is truthful, generous and honest. He will respect your 
rights even more than. you respect his. . 
Three of the first culprits I ever tried were little fellows twelve or thir- 
teen years of age. They had been captured by the police after a raid on 
the gang. In the center of the group stood little Dave, who made his tearful 
plea a the Court. I said, “David, the officer says you are guilty of 
urglary.” “But,” said David, “I ain’t no burglary.” “Well,” I said, 
perhaps you don’t understand. You are charged with going into a 
box car and taking things that didn’t belong to you.” David was quite 
typical of the constantly suppressed youngster. He was forced to live in 
that district that is a part of nearly all of our large cities, known as the 
Bottoms. Through it comes the railroad tracks. A nice place’ indeed 
for the rearing of children. He was a typical, red-headed, freckle-faced 
boy, quite frazzled out at the elbows of his little coat and the knees of his 
trousers—-and indeed some other places thereabouts—his stockings were 
down, and he dug his little fist into his tearful eyes, that had filled his face 
with rivulets of grime. “Judge,” said David, “it’s dis way. We lives 
down by the railroad tracks, we do, and we play among box cars, and the 
kids said there was watermelons in one of them; didn’t they, Ikey ”—as he 
appealed to the boy at his right. “Well,” I said, “that wasn’t any excuse 
for taking things that didn’t belong to you”—as though the judge didn’t 
know that fruit like that had offered temptation to other boys in other 
ages. “Well,” continued David, “when we got in the car and didw’t find 
no watermelons, Ikey said, ‘gee whiz, kids, I’ll bet there’s something 
good in the car, for there was boxes in there that had figs painted all over 
them,’ and Ikey said, ‘Let’s get something good anyhow’—yes, you did, 
Ikey, you know you did—and we got open the box and each one of us got 
out a bottle and it had figs painted all over it, too, and each one of us drunk
-P-A-G-E-40
PLAYGROUNDS AND DELINQUENCY 41 
a whole bottle full, and’”—to the accompaniment of tears and grimaces— 
“it was California fig syrup, and I tell you, Judge, we have suffered enough, 
haven’t we, Swedey ?” as he appealed now to the boy on the left, and Swedey 
chirped up in eloquent defense: “Sure we have, Judge, because I drunk 
two bottles,” and I accepted the plea of David that they had “suffered 
enough.” I thought so, too. 
Of course it is a bad thing for the boys to be running on the railroad 
tracks. It is only a short step to stealing from the box cars and then per- 
haps from the corner grocery and finally to “tapping the till.’ Such is 
the progress of neglected childhood. A public playground will take care 
of that natural curiosity and disposition to play and do things, and would 
save the railroad companies thousands of dollars they spend annually to 
keep the boys in the cities from making their property their playground. 
I know a railroad official who told me that they had dispensed with one 
expensive officer in one district after a scheme of personal work and help- 
fulness through the public playground had been built up. It had directed 
into better channels the otherwise misdirected energies of these children. 
A gentleman in one city of fifty thousand told me recently that the sixty 
boys who had robbed the box cars within the short space of one month 
were furnishing his road a more serious problem than the question of rail- 
road rates that was then pending in the legislature. 
Tonce talked to a young murderer nineteen years of age. He was then 
in the shadow of the gallows. He told me his lawlessness started down 
among the railroad tracks where he went to play. It was a powerful magnet 
for curiosity when there was none other. And all this is aside from the 
wholesome character-building and the effect, both morally and physically, 
upon the average boy who has the advantage of clean well-directed 
helpful play that is now to be supplied alone in many cities through the 
public playground. 
I know a city of less than three hundred thousand inhabitants in which 
there were over three thousand arrests among the boys in one year. I walked 
into one of the courts of that city and found the time of the jury, the judge 
and the counsel taken up in trying a boy of twelve for throwing a brick 
at a citizen. The next day I met the boy in the bull-pen amid hardened 
criminals. He had chains about his waist and knees. I asked the boy why 
he threw the brick. He said, “I never meant no harm, Mister; we was 
just playing.” I saw the miserable shack and crowded district where he 
lived. Can the boy be blamed if he continued to throw the bricks? Could 
we be blamed if we shed a tear at the absurdity and injustice of it all? 
Can we be blamed if we turn from the act of the boy to cry out against the 
shameful criminal State ? 
This child is a wonderful human creature—a divine machine. We 
have much to expect from him, but he has much to expect from us, and 
what he returns depends largely upon what we give. 
We shall suffer with him whether we will or no, for we do not share his
-P-A-G-E-41
42 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRA¥T 
burdens. Let us not weary of the struggle till the child gets a square deal; 
and until he does, we cannot have and do not deserve that glorious man- 
hood, that splendid citizenship that will come alone from duty done in child- 
hood’s sacred cause. 
We of the children’s courts are optimistic because we see, perhaps with 
clearer vision the most hopeful sign in this country. It is that awakened con- 
science of the State to its own responsibility for the child—that in caring 
for the child the State is simply caring for itself. 
We have ceased in this country to question the duty of the State. It 
must provide free education and pass compulsory school and child labor 
laws and establish playgrounds, trade schools and juvenile courts, for the 
State suffers just as far as the child is ignorant or weak. We do not need 
more to emphasize our responsibility. This nation must take care of its 
children. From that duty it cannot and it shall not escape. It is only true 
to itself just so far as it is true to its children. Denver, Col.

The only inductive study ever made of the effect of playgrounds on juvenile delinquencies has been prepared by Mr. Allen T. vi the pinmapagpared by Mr. é nT. Burns. It is one of the most valuable studies ever contributed to 
This paper summarizes the results of the Chicago playgrounds as 
follows: . 
A small park: neighborhood recreation center, such as those on the south side of Chicago, 
can be expected to be coincident with a 284 per cent decrease of delinquency within a radius 
of one-half mile, conditions of the neighborhood in other respects remaining stable. To 
rovide a probation district with adequate play facilities is coincident with a reduction in 
lelinquency of 28 to 70 cent, or 44 per cent as an average. In addition, over a much 
larger area, the small parks have a tendency to decrease delinquency 17 per cent. Remem- 
bering that the park areas made only a seven per cent better showing in the matter of suc- 
cessful cases than the rest of the city, it may be said that the small parks have been a greater 
factor in the prevention than in the reformation of the juvenile delinquent. For the play- 
grounds, the only indication of a helpful influence is the fact that in the long run and in 
the neighborhood very close to the playground, the children seem to be so developed that 2 
decrease of delinquency results—a decrease of 24 per cent for such neighborhoods as com- 
pared with 18 per cent for the whole city. There was no way of measuring the effect of the 
large parks upon the decrease of delinquency. They did show a helpful influence in the 
successful treatment of delinquents, there being 46 per cent of successful cases within a 
one-mile radius. This is the same favorable showing of seven per cent, as made by the 
small parks in a one-half mile radius. Upon these fi is rested the case for the thesis 
that the presence of parks and playgrounds in a neighborhood is coincident with a decrease 
of cases of juvenile delinquency and with an increase in the proportion of cases successfully 
cared for by the Court. 
A boy nine years of age was brought into court on a charge of stealing and committed 
to au institution for a short term. A year later he was again arrested for incorrigibility but 
left under care of the officer to whom he had been paroled from the institution. Three years 
after the second arrest he was again brought into court for incorrigibility and committed

-P-A-G-E-42
PLAYGROUNDS AND DELINQUENCY 43 
to the institution where the less hopeful cases are sent. After his release his family moved 
from a neighborhood entirely destitute of recreation facilities to a location near Lincoln 
park which the boy has since used constantly to spend his leisure. He has improved suffi- 
ciently to be released from court and causes no further trouble. Such cases as this, of which 
many are found among the cases traced, indicate that the better showing of park neighbor- 
hoods as to successful cases is due in part at least to the parks themselves. Thus we have 
in the matter of successful cases a possible index of the park's influence such as we could 
not have where there was no opportunity to measure the decrease of delinquency in connec- 
tion with the establishment of the park, * * * . But there are citizens who will think of the cost of the small park—$220,000 to establish 
and $29,000 per year to maintain—the cost of $1.76 for establishment and 23 cents,per year 
for maintenance to the property holder of $10,000. ‘Ten times these amounts for the South 
Side of Chicago. And this thoughtful citizen may add that the South Side’s 29 per cent favor- 
able showing represents only about one hundred bad boys saved. Asa problem in “efficient 
democracy,” I suggest that such patriots of the exchequer consider the cost to the public 
treasury of handling each case of juvenile delinquency. I hoped to be able to make such 
a comparison for Chicago, but the accounts of the county were not so kept as to make this 
practicable within the available time. I do not presume, however, that the cost of caring 
or delinquents would equal that of preventing them through the establishment of smal) 
parks. The approach of the former to the latter expense might be some solace to those 
who must make money the first consideration. 
‘There is another point of view which maintains that no matter how great the cost, the value of the saved boy is inestimably beyond it. This point of view is suggested by that 
Master of practical life who knew full well the value of money, even of the widow’s mite. 
For what shall it profit a city if it gain the whole world and lose the souls of its children ? 
C. Pruayerounps anpD THE Granp JuRY 
The Philadelphia Grand Jury has made the departure, singular enough tor a body of such character, of recommending the adoption of a general playground system for the entire city. The grand jury accounts for its taking the initiative by the explanation that play- 
grounds are essential for the prevention of crime among the young. The iruth of this assump- tion is unquestionable. * * * The obligation to safeguard the morals as well as the health 
of the young is one which State and local authorities are alike bound to respect and the ob- Seryance of which cannot be too strongly and persistently urged.—Pilisbury (Pa.) Chronicle- elegraph.

ity of limiting ‘our remedies to the court, the hangman and

Nothing is of greater importance to a nation than a contented rural 
population. A nation develops power in proportion as its people remain 
in large numbers on its farms and dwell there in comfortable prosperity. 
From these farming sections have come most of the best men and women 
of the nation, and it has come to be a truism to say that the country boy 
is a nation’s most valuable asset. Undermine the welfare of the country 
districts; allow conditions of rural life to be such as to breed discontent and 
drive people away; destroy or even seriously injure this great reservoir of 
manhood, character and patriotista and you have a social condition which 
not only threatens the life of the nation, but if not remedied, is actually 
the beginning of the end of that nation’s career. 
Yet who does not know that we are menaced by this very thing that 
we dread? Far and wide the rural districts have been depleted of their 
population. The situation long ago became serious. In some sections there 
are not enough men to exploit the natural resources of the land. Churches 
and schools become less well attended, grow weak, and close. ‘Things 
combine to work in a vicious circle; isolation and hardships drive many 
away and these isolations and hardships become intensified for those who 
remain. 
Under these conditions, child life in the country frequently becomes 
peculiarly dull and unattractive; especially to adolescents. Nearly every- 
thing conspires to drive them cityward. It is well to have a large ‘number 
of them go to the city, a very large number, but when practically all 
want to go, and so many go that the movement swells to an exodus, it is 
time to seek for remedial measures. House, church, school and local 
governing bodies should write intelligently to produce conditions which 
will make for contentment. 
Fortunately, examples of notable efforts are not wanting. Life in many 
rural neighborhoods is being made far more rich and attractive than for- 
merly. It would be interesting to consider the several elements which enter 
into the problem of securing a wider and better rural life, but attention can 
be directed here to only one, namely, the cultivation of the athletic and play 
life of country children which is making such rapid progress. 
Country children need play just as much as do city children. ‘They 
need it for its mental, moral, physical and social value. They need it 
because it makes for happiness, contentment and community spirit. They 
44,
-P-A-G-E-44
THE NEED IN RURAL DISTRICTS 45 
need it because they do not codperate well, because they are too strongly 
individualistic, because they yearn for the companionship which conditions 
in only too many cases prevent them from enjoying, because physically 
they are not, as a rule, well developed, not being able to meet even as suc- 
cessfully as do city children, the average athletic standard tests, such for 
instance as are prescribed for the Public Schools Athletic League. In all 
these respects play supplies the very training, discipline, and inspiration 
which these children most need; so its great importance to them can scarcely 
be overstated. 
Yet in the face of this great need of theirs, we all know they do not play 
enough, while some have almost no play life at all. Except in places where 
special effort has been made to teach them, they know surprisingly few 
games. Moreover, their few games are strongly individualistic, training 
them for isolated effort, rather than for codperation. 
The country child would undoubtedly play more if conditions were 
more favorable. But they are not favorable to play. He does not know 
how to play or what to play; his parents are usually out of sympathy with 
play; and in the country schools not only are his teachers as ignorant as 
himself in regard to these matters, but even if the child and his teacher did 
know, the trustee in many cases would interpose objections and forbid any 
effort being made in the direction of organized play or athletics. 
So here is where an earnest systematic propaganda is necessary. It 
would be well if country and village school teachers could receive instruction 
in that art of play, and ministers and other adults be enlisted in the cause 
of rural playgrounds. 
Properly organized playgrounds and adequate opportunities for enjoy- 
ing them will help check the exodus from the farms. Where these have been 
provided, boys have definitely decided to stay at home and farm it, instead 
of leaving for the city. This is not a vision; there are actual instances to 
support the claim. And the equipment does not need to be elaborated 
nor the opportunities laboriously abundant. A boy doesn’t want to play 
all the time. Give him an occasional chance and he is happy. Let him 
have his play hours to look forward to and a great play festival once a year 
and the prospects, particularly of the latter, will brighten life for weeks and 
even months, first by eager anticipation, and then by the happy retrospect. 
Those who have had experience with play festivals in the country know 
what a tremendous power they become in the life of country people, young 
and old, how they check restlessness and quiet discontent by supplying 
the variety, the companionship, the mental and physical activity which are 
so ardently craved. Perhaps the chief benefit of play in the country will 
be found in its socializing influences, and in this respect alone it not only 
means greater efficiency of the individual but a more wholesome community 
life and eventually a stronger nation.

EXTRACTS FROM THE Paper or G. E. JOHNSON

Scarcely twelve months ago the whole country was shocked by a dis- 
aster to school children in Cleveland so horrible in its details that men in 
distant cities wept in street cars as they read the account in the morning 
papers. * * * 
During the coming year more than one hundred thousand children 
will end their young lives, the bloom of babyhood scarcely vet faded from 
their cheeks, and tens of thousands of Rachels will mourn for their little 
ones and not be comforted. 
To those who rejoice in the living, Dr. Hutchinson’s cheering declara- 
tion that “It isn’t so very dangerous to be alive,” will bring its reassurance, 
but to those who mourn for the dead, it will lend an added pathos. The 
unnecessary loss is the hardest to bear. And this loss, inconceivably great 
as it is, is largely within our power to prevent. For not only is it not so very 
dangerous for a child from five to fifteen to be alive, it is the natural and 
easy thing for him to remain alive—if he has a fair chance. 
These are the years when the life forces are at the flood. It is as if 
Nature endeavored to repeat in each young life at this age the observance 
of the Passover and had sprinkled upon the gate posts of these ten hopeful 
years the sign of immunity that the Angel of Death seeing might pass by. 
We school men often congratulate ourselves that during the years that 
constitute the school age for the great majority of children are the years 
when the death rate is lowest. And yet the aggregate preventable loss 
through death in these most favored years is enormous and the sad proces- 
sions that follow abandoned hopes to the grave outnumber in the aggregate 
the armies of the world. 
But there is another and more serious loss than this. It is not the 
death rate during the school age, however great or small, that is the sig- 
nificant thing for us. The significant thing is whether in these years of 
Nature’s smiles strength or weakness is being laid by for future years- 
We are learning more and more clearly every year that our skulking foe, 
the microbe, of whatever tribe, strikes when a man is down. Patiently 
he bides his time, gathering his forces in secret until the time to strike. 
No better illustration could be given than that of tuberculosis. According 
to Newsholme, only three children in 10,000 from five to fifteen years of

age, die of consumption, but from fifteen to forty-five more than one person 
in four dies of this dread disease. Speaking along this line, Dr. Tyler says: 
“It would seem highly probable that the increased death-rate of girls at 
eighteen and thereabout from consumption and other diseases of relatively 
slow action is the culmination of an attack begun at thirteen or fourteen. 
If we are to diminish this death-rate, we must fortify the girl against the 
period of greatest weakness when she is most likely to receive hospitably 
the germs of fatal diseases. To accomplish this we must not wait until the 
twelfth or thirteenth year, but meet the difficulty in childhood.” 
Huber, also, in his work on “Consumption” says: “There is the long 
period of latency in which, if the child be well nurtured and if he live 
hygienically, he will be likely to overcome such tendency to disease as he 
may have begun life with.” 
When at some future time posterity looks back upon the conditions that 
prevail in our day, it will behold no darker picture, no more disgraceful 
thing than our weak surrender of our children to sickness and death. What 
excuse can then be offered for the fact that even in this land, more than 
one-half of all the children born into the world die before they have 
reached man’s estate; that seventy per cent of school children suffer some 
physical handicap, more or less serious, at the very threshold of life’s 
opportunity; that our schools not only do not fortify the children against 
known enemies, but actually betray them, in their innocency to deadly foes. 
AIR 
The playground is the only place where a school child gets air in the 
proper amount and kind, the only place where he obtains full and com- 
plete aeration of the blood. A despicable fraction of school rooms have 
standard ventilating apparatus, and the rooms that have do not always 
adequately benefit thereby. I have personally tested a score of school rooms 
almost under the shadow of the capitol of a state that has the best of existing 
Jaws, and found the supply of air to equal the standard in only two of the 
rooms and in some it fell to less than one-fourth of that amount. 
But could ventilation be perfect in a school room, there could not be 
the same aeration of the blood of a seated, studying child as of a child on 
the playground. There must be the exhilaration of joyous exercise, the 
strengthened pulse, the quickened, deepened breathing, the full chest of 
sustained effort that draws the blood to the very apex of the lungs, to meet 
the needs of the growing child. The school room may be made less and less 
objectionable, but so long as it remains a school room it cannot escape the 
imperative need of the playground as a factor in school hygiene. 
As you well know, it is not only the lack of oxygen but also the presence 
of organic poison in exhaled air that makes ventilation so important. * * * 
SUNSHINE 
“Where the sun does not go, the doctor does,” is an Italian proverb 
quoted by Kotelman. Try as we may, we cannot get the sun sufficiently
-P-A-G-E-47
48 PLAYGROUND TFCHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
into all our school rooms, and if we could we would shut it out again as 
soon as we let the children in to study, because we say it hurts their eyes. 
Where then shall the children bathe in the sunshine as they should, 
but on the playground? We do well to debar contagious diseases from 
the schools, but let fly over our children’s clothing myriads of bacilli, while 
the most malignant perish in a short time in the joy and the sunshine of 
the playgtound. Few disease germs have been discovered that can survive 
even for one hour the streaming sun on the face of a laughing child. 
You remember the experiment with the tadpoles. They were placed 
away from the sunlight for thirty days and during all that time ceased to 
grow. Returned to the sunlight, they resumed their growth and advanced 
farther in one day than in all the previous thirty. Placed once more away 
from the sunlight and then returned to normal conditions, they grew to 
stunted froghood. Just such an experiment, society tried with babies in 
the dark rooms of New York’s tenements, and every baby, almost without 
exception, born and kept in those rooms, died. But when Jacob Riis 
smashed the windowless walls and the light of Heaven streamed in, the 
babies began to live. 
In our cities and larger towns everywhere, we are still repeating, in a 
measure, the same experiment and place our children, like the unfortunate 
tadpoles, in darkened homes, narrow, shaded, and smoke enveloped alleys, 
and in school rooms into which the sun seldom or never enters. Nay! 
‘i te in sgreol rooms lit even in the middle of the day by natural or artifi- 
lal'gas. Bring to these little ones medical inspection, examine their eyes, 
ce their adenoids, protect them from measles, and all the rest, ‘but 
shall we not also provide a playground, where for a part of the day they 
may bathe in the sun as God Almighty has said they must, if they live ¢ 
EXERCcIsE 
J have just examined the indexes of two famous books on school 
hygiene and in them was no such word as exercise. But exercise is life, 
and the absence of it is the sure sign of death. By exercise came evolution. 
Exercise shaped the body, determined the vital organs, built the brain. 
By exercise the child takes possession of his inheritance from the race. To 
him it is the past, the present and the promise of the future. 
But that exercise no man can dictate, no teacher devise, no scholar 
fully define. It comes forth unbidden from the child, declares his nature, 
discovers him to himself, defines his relation to his mates, shows him the 
world. It is his play, it is himself. Can the school alone do this, be this? 
In the long process in which exercise shaped the body and built the brain 
there was determined for all time the path by which the child must come 
into his own. In that shortened process we call childhood, every faculty, 
every power, every organ that fails to receive its due exercise shrivels, health 
by so much suffers and by so much the man becomes less a man, It would 
require a book to speak in full of the exercises of the playground that meet
-P-A-G-E-48
THE PLAYGROUND AND PUBLIC HYGIENE 49 
the needs of health, physical, mental, moral, zsthetic, social health, for all 
these are elements in the health of the body, as. we all have come to under- 
stand. But in many respects, in the very nature of the case, these exercises 
are impossible in the school; they are possible only on the playground. 
Once upon a time the people of a certain city really believed what I 
have just been trying to say, and when the question arose as to whether they 
should build a great public school or open a playground it was decided to 
open a playground. Now it came to pass, in the course of years, that the 
citizens of that city advanced so far beyond the rest of the human race, that 
in all the centuries since, the nations that have gone on building public 
schools and neglecting to open playgrounds have not been able to catch up 
with them even to this day. * * * 
We have reversed the order of importance in education as it was ob- 
served by the Greeks. ‘The Greek education was essentially a playground 
education and the education most nearly approaching it today is that sup- 
plied by the playgrounds of America. To that classic demonstration of the 
educational value of the playground has been added in our day an avalanche 
of testimony from biology, physiology, anthropology, psychology and 
sociology. Of the $10,000,000 playgrounds of Chicago, Ex-President 
Roosevelt says: “They are the greatest civic achievement the world has 
ever seen.” 
To Sum Up 
First: We do not take good care of our children. 
Second: We need to improve our care along four lines, namely, better 
food, better air, more sunshine, better exercise. 
Third: In the very nature of the case the playground alone can ade- 
quately supply the last three of these to the child. 
Fourth: ‘This is no new experiment. We have the classic playground 
along with classic literature, architecture and art. 
Finally: Just as we have awakened to the fact that the school provides 
but a small fraction of a child’s education, that environment, which includes 
everything that comes into the child’s experience is teaching him every 
waking moment of the day (perhaps every sleeping hour of the night, if 
we agree with Doctor Worcester), so we have come to understand that the 
activities of the school provide but a small fraction of the exercise necessary 
for the health of a child in this larger meaning. * * * 
Not in the school but on the playground can these deep instincts 
of workmanship, imitation, rivalry, codperation, find their true and genetic 
expression and build more stately mansions in the soul as the swift seasons 
roll. These instincts calling from the deeps of the child’s nature are not 
voices calling him astray, or to delay his upward progress. They are the 
voices saying to him and to the race:

Physical education as a science is a department of hygiene. It is not an end in ilself 
but a means to health and vigor. There is no branch of hygiene with which we are not 
concerned, no preventive agency which it is not our function to use. But we are naturally 
concerned more with personal hygiene than with natural and public hygiene; and of those 
subjects upon which we should be the most capable of giving competent ac ce—diet, rest 
periods and muscular activity are most vitally important. Upon these principally depend 
not only the organic vigor but the intellectuality and moral capacity of the child and the 
ultimate man. Of the three, diet and rest periods are in a sense neyatire or passive and 
reeuperative factors while muscular activity is positive, active and creative and hence most 
important, but it is an entirely mistaken perspective which would emphasize uni one of 
these factors to the exclusion of another. 
Three years is the average length of time which we may expect to have with gymmasium 
members. To cultivate in them during this time a half-dozen good hygienic habits is worth 
more to them in the long run of life than the whole three years of gymnastics. “Veach them 
how to eat, to sleep, to use the daily tonic of the eool bath, to dress loosely and with adapla- 
tion, to care for the eyes, and above all to make a hobby of some outdoor game or sport 
walking, running (cross-country), horseback riding, Dicveling, yolf, tennis, ele..—to eulti- 
vate this habit the year round or, better, to ride some hobby according to the season and 
tide it hard. Let the seasonal scent of the air bring on the spell of golf chubs, skates or 
racket, as it does foothall, peg tops, marbles and baseball with the small boy. Fashions in gymnastics may come and go, but recreation suust go on forever. ,

, The human body is what we make it; muscle and nerve cells reflect the whole previous 
hygienic history of the man. Nutrition, strength of tissue, and organie function are the 
Joint product of diet, exercise and other personal habits of life. Modern conditions of living and of labor are responsible for a cieplorable lack of or- 
ganic vigor, especially among the people of our cities. ‘This tendency to physical degenera-

‘The wearing of clothes is as unnatural to human beings as dwelling in houses, and 
the evils prowing out of house-dwelling, and smothering the skin with artificial coverings 
must be antidoted by such means as are afforded by the swimming pool and the outdoor 
gymnasium. I know of no single measure by which so much good can be accomplished 
as by these. Swimming in water at a proper temperature (75 to 78 degrees) is the most 
admirable of all developmental exercises. The position of the body is such as to give the

brought into active exercise under the most favorable conditions. The temperature of the 
water both stimulates and facilitates muscular movement and cardiac activity. There is no 
other form of physical exercise from which so much benefit may be derived in 80 short a time. 
‘A half hour in the swimming pool two or three times a week and an hour with the skin 
largely uncovered in an outdoor gymnasium every other day during the warm months will 
work wonders in building up a good physique and developing those functions of the body 
which prepare it to offer the highest resistance to disease. . 
Provision should be made in connection with every school for instruction and practice 
in switaming, both summer and winter: and properly equipped outdoor gymnasiums should 
also be provided for both sexes in which a considerable part of the body’s surface may be 
exposed to the air and the sun. Man is naturally an outdoor animal and sequires the 
advantages to be derived from contact of the fresh air and the sunshine with the skin surface 
as much as does the gorilla, the chimpanzee and other animals akin to man in their physical 
structure. Facilities of this sort may be provided at moderate cost, and the expense should 
not be at all burdensome even in country districts, especially if the present movement for 
the consolidation of country schools proves successful. 
D. Goop Hreatra Ann Goon GovEeRNMENT* 
At the third Play Congress in Pittsburg Congressman Burke said in 
part: 
Good health promotes good government, and good government likewise promotes 
good health. When the health of the individual becomes impaired through the neglect of his physical 
necessities, he forfeits much of his force in sustaining and developing human society. The 
man who has never cultivated his mind or body, or having developed them, has subse- 
quently destroyed them through neglect or abuse, becomes as a consequence, and to the 
extent of that destruction a figure without force in human affairs. 
soviet health is therefore one of the essential attributes of every rugged unit of civilized 
__ Man was created to do useful things for his fellow men. In placing him here, God 
intended that he should toil by the sweat of his brow, in order that he mght accomplish 
the high purpose of man and enjoy the pleasures that endure. 
He was not placed here that he might prove indifferent to or neglectful of the persons 
and things by which he was to be surrounded. He was intended to be useful to himself 
and helpful to others. 
While all things of man’s creation decay with neglect, there is nothnig in art or nature 
that fails as fast and as certainly as man in idleness, and as his energies are destroyed or 
his faculties undeveloped or impaired by ignorance of or indifference to the ordinary laws of 
sanitation or sane living during his childhood, or in his mature years, to that extent does 
indolence upon his part become natural, and to the extent of his idling is his usefulness and 
value as a citizen impaired. 
It is therefore important that in so far as the government has the righi to interfere in the 
regulations of the affairs of the individual it is not only proper but important that it should 
by every means within its power encourage the adoption of methods that will promote and 
protect ‘the health of the citizens. It is quite as important to prevent the development of 
disease by encouraging young and old to enjoy the blessings of the open air and sunshine 
and ithe fod health and high spirits that result, as it is to destroy disease, once it has 
leveloped. 
While the scientific world is busy with the development of cures, it is equally essential 
that the social world should be busy in the development of all forms of prevention of those 
evils which result in the breaking down of the mental and physical structures of the people. 
With the rapid increase of population in our great cities, these questions are impressing 
themselves upon us with greater force from day to day, and these alarming factors are not 
coufined alone to this country, but are developing elsewhere with alarming rapidity. Itis 
only a few years since the Jnspector General of the English army said, “The one subject 
that causes anxiety for the future regarding recruiting is the great deterioration of physique

of that class of our people from which the bulk of the recruits for the army must be drawn, 
Were all classes to provide their offspring with ample food and air space, a healthy race 
would be produced and the Proper material to fill the ranks of the army would be obtained.” 
In 1858 the standard o} height in the English army was five feet, six inches; in 1883 it 
was reduced to five feet, three inches; in 1900 it fell to five feet in stockings. 
A similar] alarming shrinkage in chest measurement was shown. 511 out of every 
1000 ured $4; which was less than the minimum chest measurement in 1883. 
In weight one-third of the whole army fell sbort of the 186 pounds required a generation 
before. In 1900 the operage British recruit at the age of 19 was two inches shorter, and one 
inch smaller around the chest, fifteen pounds lighter than the normal Anglo-Saxon youth 
of that age ought to be. Fifty per cent of the London youths were rejected as unfit even after the standard had been lowered. Of the 11,000 young men examined in Manchester, 
8,000 were rejected for want of stamina and defects. In 1903, 81,000 British soldiers were 
discharged as unfit for duty after less than two years of service and were discharged as invalids. 
And to a very large extent were the crowded conditions of great England held respon- 
sible for the decrease in the physical standard. In a recent article by Ralph D. Payne, he 
states that the conditions are no better in the smaller cities of Scotland than they are in 
London, where 300,000 Londoners live in one-room tenements with three or more occupants. 
In order to provide vigorous recruits for her army and to strengthen the foundations of 
the empire, Germany prevents the overcrowding of the slum districts in her cities by a 
system of wise far-sighted legislation. In Berlin the housing conditions of the poorer classes 
are regulated and when overcrowding occuts, a new outlet for pulation is found by the 
city, which constructs the streets and sewers and maintains the practical cooperation by builders by methods tautually satisfactory. No German town of any note is without a genet- ous layground and recreation center for its people. ° country the housii . .e liza

It had never occurred to us that any defense for beautifying the play 
ground was necessary. We had always supposed that the reason why many 
of them were not beautified was on account of lack of money rather than 
absence of desire. Of course, the first essential of a playground is that it 
should make provision for play; after this end is accomplished it should be 
beautified. Play purposes will not be decreased by making things as beau- 
tiful as possible. In fact no playground should be entitled to the name 
which does not provide for the pleasure of the eve. Fences are necessary 
why should not hedges or vine-covered fences fulfill the purpose rather 
than the unsightly board fence or expensive wrought iron picket fence ? 
  LITTLE CHILDREN’S PLAYGROUND, TRIANGLE PARK 
Louisville, Ky. 
The first playground we ever saw was Columbus Ave., Boston, which 
at that time was a desolate waste of cinders without a tree or speck of green 
upon it. Our impression was that if we should be obliged to play there it 
would have to be under compulsion, especially so if the country was within 
ten miles walking distance, but that may be because we were raised in 2

THE PLAYGROUND BEAUTIFUL 55 
small village, and that most of our early recreation time was spent in the 
woods. 
The purpose of play and landscape gardening should be to foster in 
the child the love of nature and the beautiful. The form which seems best 
adapted for this purpose is informal gardening or wild gardening. 
Esthetic taste has a true commercial value for a manufacturing com- 
munity. W.'T. Harris, speaking of this says: 
One will concede at the first that tool work is valuable as industrial training, for it 
teaches us to manufacture tools and machinery for the performance of all kinds of labor. 
‘The study of natural science is still more valuable, especially in its application to mathe- 
matics and the laws of matter and motion, It furnishes the theory of all machinery and of 
all production of supplies from nature. 
Besides this we claim that general education is of the utmost importance, opening as 
it does the powers of thought and observation. 
Esthetic education, the cultivation of taste, the acquirement of knowledge on the subject 
of the origin of beauty, the practice of producing the outlines of the beautiful, all these things 
we must claim form the true foundations of the best success in the industries of any modern 
nation. ‘Che dynamic side is needed, but the invention of the useful does not succeed in con- 
trolling the markets of the world. A nation with praceful shapes to its productions com- 
mands higher prices for them. A graceful shape and the proper ornamentation charm 
the purchaser and he willingly pays a higher price for the beautiful article of usefulness 
made by an artist than if it is made by the mere artisan. 
“On another occasion I have called attention to the backward state of Swedish educa- 
tion in the zsthetic art. Sweden is the leader in the manual training movement, but her 
educators have not yet seen the importance of developing correct taste among the laborers 
as a condition of industrial success. Accordingly we find that ingenuity is increasing to 
some extent in that country, but that there is no improvement in the artistic finish and 
ornamentation of their goods. Clumsy shapes and incongruous ornament are the charac- 
teristics of Swedish goods. Other nations do not want such ugly shapes in sight and do 
not buy them. ‘To have ugly utensils perpetually in view generally works degeneration in 
one’s tastes.” —From Educational Report, 1904, pages 1183-1136. . 
Figures from our commercial reports show that we import raw materials from Sweden, 
but that we do not buy their manufactures. In 1881 the imports from Sweden and Norway 
of raw materials amounted to $744,018.00, but of manufactures of iron and steel, $111,749.00 
were reported. We imported wood manufactures from them only to the amount of $137.00, 
but we imported rags for the paper manufacturers to the amount of $39,000.00, but no 
manufactured clothing to speak of. The same year Belgium sent us wood manufactures 
to the amount of $118,146.00. 
Prince Albert in 1851 became convinced that the English manufactured goods were not 
of a character to compete with those of France and Belgium. So he set in motion a dee] 
reaching system of art education that should correct the national defect and recover the 
prestige of British manufactures. General instruction was given in the forms of ornamenta- 
tion which the world considered beautiful. From this time began a gradual rise in the taste 
of the English workman; from being an artisan pure and simple, he began to be an artist. 
England has gone forward rapidly in the production of works of taste. . 
Taking the hint from England, we have in our country paid considerable attention 
to the cultivation of art education. . . The days of poverty must of necessity be satisfied with the useful without ornamentation 
even though the poor desire it. As progress in wealth advances the ssthetic is demanded. 
If the country is to keep its prestige in the markets of the world and especially if we wish 
to handle the fancy trade, every possible effort must be made for the cultivation of the zesthetic 
taste of our workmen. 
Beautiful surroundings are as important, in fact are more important 
for the cultivation of taste than is special art education. If we make our 
playgrounds and cities beautiful the children will become accustomed to 
the beautiful, will demand the beautiful, and will copy and produce the 
beautiful.

B. Imrorrance or A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN 
When commencing the construction of a playground the first thing 
that should be done is to draw up a comprehensive plan of development. 
Not only should the playground be planned by one who has the knowledge 
of shrubs and trees but it is necessary to have the work laid out by one who 
is intimate with playground needs. Most of the playgrounds in our country 
are rather badly laid out and much money is wasted in changing them; for 
instance, two playgrounds in Denver were laid out in such a way as to make 
it impossible to play baseball on the block, whereas with a little more careful 
planning it would have been possible to have accommodated three times 
the number of children in a much more effective and beneficial way, on the 
same grounds, The apparatus is often set up in the wrong place and im- 
provements are not projected with reference to the future. 
The North Denver playground illustrates this. It is on a side hill 
and the gymnasium frame was put on the top above grade. It occupied 
the only level spot on the block large enough for baseball. Of course the 
boys who had been playing baseball were much more interested in their 
own game than in an “old open air gymnasium” fit only for the use of 
de big guys.” Also the placing of this equipment here covered up the dirt 
which was necessary in order to fill the lower part of the grounds. The 
Playground was so small and the street grades were such that it was im- 
Ths tae grade it in terraces without going way below the street line. 
ade it necessary to lower the upper end and raise the lower end as described under the article on construction, pages 109-115. 
dow at expense entailed in the erection of the apparatus, taking 
> Te-erecting in the proper place, together with the damage done 
ne bard fechas remsbly about five or six hundred dollars to say nothing 
When contemplating the placing of a playground in a new neigh- 
borhood the first thing to be done should be to study the “kids” in the 
neighborhood and see what they want. There is considerably more to a 
playground than teeters and see-saws and gymnastics. If we don’t give 
the children what they want they won’t come and we don’t blame them. 
It takes considerable of a playground to compete with the excitement of 
the street. We can’t make the children take what we think they ought to 
have. They may not want just what they ought to have. We have to com- 
promise and give what they will take and later add what they need. 
The first thing one “playground” (?) did was to destroy the play- 
ground the children already had and as very little supervision was given, 
those boys were the “sorest bunch of kids” imaginable. It was reported 
to us that they whittled points on the handles of the teeter ladders, cut 
the ropes, and raised havoc generally so that the neighbors were continu- 
ally making complaints. One of the boys asked us, “Be youse going to 
leave the little punks on the playground this year?” On being questioned 
as to what he meant he stated that “last year there was a big man stood at
-P-A-G-E-56
THE PLAYGROUND BEAUTIFUL 57 
the gate and didn’t leave none of the little punks in.” We later learned that 
they didn’t have enough money to have the ground supervised all the time. 
We think that if not enough money is available for supervision, grading and 
equipment the supervision should come first, then the grading and then 
the equipment, and after that the playground can be made beautiful. But 
a comprehensive plan and an expert estimate is absolutely essential in order 
to know what to do and what not to do.

CHAPTER IX 
A. Tue Deveropment or PLaycrounp LanpscaPE GARDENING AND 
ARCHITECTURE IN THE Unirep Srates 
The forces which have contributed to the development of beautiful 
playgrounds have been the same as those which have led to the develop- 
ment of parks. With our English and German traditions we have inherited 
the love of nature and the beautiful in nature. England has always had 
sport fields and parks. So naturally the villages of New England had 
their commons with baseball and football fields which were used also for 
the pasturage of cows. It has always been their inalienable right for all 
children to play upon these commons. 
1. Tue Sport Frey. Our park movement and our playground 
movement so far as they are concerned with “sport fields” have a common 
origin. As the towns grew into cities it was found necessary to adapt these 
parks to use, and throughout the whole country the majority of the cities 
maintained parks with facilities for athletics which might be termed “ sport 
fields.” Located in parks of course they are in the beautiful surroundings 
made possible by landscape architecture. Boston has been the leader in 
the sport field movement. 
2. Tus Genesis or tHE Ourpoor Gymnasrum. Two factors led 
to the combination of the park and the outdoor gymnasium into the play- 
ground or recreation park. First, the development of gymnasiums and 
facilities for physical training. There seemed to be a need for exercise 
out of doors. Second, the maintenance of small parks in thickly crowded 
sections of the city is a very serious problem. Feeling that they had a solu- 
tion of this problem the Boston Park Board secured the codperation of 
Dr. D. A. Sargeant, who had not forgotten when he was a boy and he 
designed some gymnasium apparatus, appropriate for outdoor use. 
A well known landscape architect was secured to add the beautifying 
and the Charlesbank Playground was a reality. This was the beginning 
of the esthetic development of playgrounds in this country. There was 
an open air gymnasium for men with a running track at one end, then came 
a little interior park such as had been common all over the city, having the 
usual landscape features found in such interior breathing spaces, with walks,

  shrubs and grass. At the other end 
was a playground* for women and 
children with gymnasium apparatus 
and a little running track around the 
outside with grass in the center for 
the children to play on. A high board 
fence surrounded the women’s gym- 
nasium and a thicket of shrubs was 
planted along the outside to screen 
the unsightly fence from the passers- 
by. Both of these playgrounds had 
buildings with locker rooms and 
space for dressing and storage. This 
pioneer playground was opened in 
1889. It was the forerunner and in- 
spiration for many other similar 
movements of the country, the most 
notable of which is the development 
of the Recreation Parks of the South 
Park Commission of Chicago and 
the Louisville Recreation Parks. 
3. Tue Recreation Park, 
Louisvitte. In 1892 the same 
landscape architects whe laid out the 
Charlesbank Playground were se- 
cured to plan a park system for 
Louisville, Ky. Among the im- 
provements projected was that of an 
open air gymnasium at Boone Park 
and in two other small squares. 
Boone Park was laid out on the site 
of an old residence. It was in the 
form of a small recreation park. It 
had a playground for the boys con- 
taining swings, giant strides and par- 
allel bars, which were made by a local 
carpenter. The surface of this play 
space was covered with pebbles one- 
fourth to one-half inch in diameter. 
*The women’s and children’s playground was 
opened in 1891.

and a band stand. Both of these play spaces were surrounded with 
iron fences covered with roses and part of the grounds were laid off in 
a large open lawn surrounded by macadamized walk with shrubbery 
and trees placed in appropriate places. Outside of the walk, betweet 
it and the street, shrubbery was planted. About this same time in 
Louisville two other very small playgrounds were laid out. They could
-P-A-G-E-60

hardly be called playgrounds. They were at the intersection of two streets, 
and contained a fountain and benches, and shade was obtained by cover- 
ing them with vines. They also contained play facilities but were soon dis- 
mantled because they were not properly policed and became a loafing place 
for bums. Boone Park Playground in its construction very nearly ap- 
proached the present idea of Recreation Park, emphasizing as it did the 
playground rather than the open air gymnasium. It was a small inte- 
rior park with facilities for play. It, however, lacked the proper amount 
of supervision and it had “Keep Off the Grass” signs in the large central 
grass plot, but in all the essential features except that of supervision by 
playground instructors rather than by park guards it was a modern play- 
ground.

Board commenced planning a model playground for Louisville. It was 
laid out in two parts: a large grass-covered athletic field surrounded by 
a macadamized walk, and a playground for small children with a wading 
pool and with an artistic little shelter house.* 
5. First Wapine Poon or THE Country IN SMaut Park. So far 
as we know this was the first wading pool in the country to be installed in 
a small park. The children’s playground had a shelter house which con- 
tained toilet facilities and a central play room surrounded with a wrought 
iron picket fence. Around the outside of the playground next to the street 
were planted different varieties of hardy shrubbery and trees were located 
at appropriate places. This playground was two years in construction being 
completed in 1900. It cost exclusive of the land about $55,000.00 for those 
two years. It was placed in charge of a park guard.

6. Cenrrat Park. The Dupont estate, a large private residence 
and park, had been carried on by the Park Board as a public park for 
several years. It was located in the heart of the residence district of the 
city, with the foreign population of the “Cabbage Patch,” several blocks 
distant on one side while the other side of the estate fronted upon the finest 
residence street of the city. It comprised a tract of about fifteen acres: 
thickly covered with an old grove of elms and other shade trees. In 1900 
a referendum was prepared that asked that the city issue bonds for ninety 
thousand dollars to purchase this estate to be used as a public playground.

been used in securing playground votes. The scheme worked beautifully 
and the voters consented to the issuance of the bonds. Several years were

in, this park formed part of the playground system which was inaugurated 
in 1902.

another smali playground about two acres in extent, Baxter Square. This 
also had a large wading pool, a small central grass plot, macadamized walk 
around the outside and shrubbery between that and the street. An iron 
picket fence was placed around the outside. This ground also was placed 
in charge of a park guard, and was intended for the small children only.

and a woman instructor at each ground six hours a day and with a park 
guard on the grounds all the time. The “Keep Off the Grass” signs were 
pulled down, the children were allowed on the grass and conducted organ- 
ized plays and games six hours each day. At the expiration of the six 
hours they were sent off the grass but could spend the rest of the time on 
the walks or using the gymnasium apparatus. Simple playground equip- 
ment such as swings, ladders, see-saws, sandboxes, basketball courts and 
lawn tennis courts were provided. 
The whole system was in charge of a trained supervisor who directed 
the work of the various assistants. With the exception of New York, 
and possibly Chicago, we think that Louisville was the first city to employ 
a general supervisor of playgrounds, and Louisville was also the first city 
in the country to have all of its playgrounds maintained under one organi- 
zation. 
9. Puttaperraia: Tue Joun Dickinson Piaycrounp.* So far 
as we have been able to discover after Charlesbank the next playground 
approaching the modern idea and including esthetic features was the 
John Dickinson Playground, Philadelphia. This playground was open 
to the public in 1898. It consisted of a city block which was  sur- 
rounded with a border of trees with a large open field in the center and with 
a building for men on one side of the grounds and with one for women and 
children on the other. The features of the playground equipment were 
mostly of a gymnastic nature such as were to be found in the Charlesbank 
Gymnasium. 
On account of lack of supervision and defects of construction, for 
example the walk around the playground was made out of marble dust 
which became finely pulverized and was blown all over the neighborhood 
by every wind that stirred, this playground received very severe criticism 
on the part of the neighbors, for the marble dust became very obnoxious. 
On account of lack of fences and supervision the playground was, I believe, 
closed up, and the sad experience gained therefrom has delayed the play- 
ground movement in Philadelphia very greatly, and has hindered the de- 
velopment many years. 
10. New Yorx. The Park Playgrounds in New York have always 
partaken more largely of the nature of outdoor gymnasiums and sport 
fields combined than of recreation parks like those of Chicago and 
Louisville. The first of these, Hudson Bank Gymnasium and Playground, 
was opened in 1898. 
*For an account of this Playground see Article by John EH. Chase, Playgrounds, November, 1908- 
January, 1909.

ll. Curcaco. “In 1896, under the auspices of the University 
Settlement of the Northwestern University, a large and splendidly equipped 
playground was opened which would accommodate from three to four 
thousand children.” The expenses for this work were paid by several 
gentlemen who desired to furnish an object lesson to the city. “Numerous 
swings, large and small, giant strides, see-saws, sand piles, etc., afford 
ample amusement for the children, who fairly swarm here. There is also 
a large shelter provided with plenty of benches and with a retiring room. 
A police officer, who is a father to the boys, and a matron have the charge 
of the grounds. The police in the neighborhood are much interested in 
this venture; in the spring they planted six trees in the grounds,” showing 
their appreciation of the work. So far as we have been able to find out this 
is the first instance of beautification in a Chicago playground.

Of course, Chicago, in common with the other American cities, had 
its public parks with sport fields in them. 
When the South Park Commission conceived the idea that their parks 
should be useful as well as beautiful, the Playground Beautiful arrived at 
self-consciousness. For a full description of this system of parks see

138. Cananpataua, N. Y. One of the best examples of playground 
landscape gardening is shown at Canandaigua, which is described by 
Charles Mulford Robinson, Ph. D., in a paper “Landscape Gardening for 
Playgrounds,” which was reprinted in the Proceedings, 1908, of the Play- 
ground Association of America. In this article, Mr. Robinson tells in detail 
the reasons for making playgrounds beautiful, suggests some methods of 
landscape gardening including beautification of play space. He suggests 
shrubs, vines and flowers adapted for use. This paper is a very valuable 
contribution to the subject.

Tur RecreaTIon Parks or CHICAGO 
By Henry S. Curtis 
1. Oniciv. In 1903 an amendment was made to the Park Act 
enabling the South Park Commission to issue bonds for the purchase and 
equipment of ten new parks. These were laid out with all the esthetic 
features ever seen in any park in the country and with every variety and 
sort of recreation feature. The following by Dr. Curtis is a characteristic 
description: 
2. Description: Tue Sour Park PLaycrounps. No one cap 
see the new system of parks and playgrounds in Chicago without a feeling 
of admiration and wonder at this magnificent civic enterprise. T aking all 
in all and considering the magnificence with which it is planned, the great 
number and variety of new features which have been introduced, and the 
rapidity with which it has been accomplished, this seems to me one of the 
most remarkable undertakings that h: i by Com- monwealth. ings that has been carried through by any 
3, Manner or Apponrmenr or Commission. The South Park 
Commissioners, appointed by the judges of the circuit court, and thus inde- 
pendent of politics, have always been men of the highest ability and integ- 
rity. The actual supervision of the parks and playgrounds has been in the 
hands of Mr. J. Frank Foster, a man of tireless energy and unusual ability, 
for the past twenty-seven years. He has had the same freedom in making 
appointments and discharges that a man has in his own private business. 
South Park is a separate taxing body and levies a tax of two mills on South 
Chicago for the support of this park system, so that it is independent of 
the city both in its officers and its funds. It gets its appropriations directly 
from the State. It has a separate police force, a separate water system an 
is now installing a separate electric light plant. This form of organization 
has doubtless added to the efficiency of the system, yet, the new South 
Park System still remains a work of almost inexplicable genius. 
4. Cosr. A little more than two years ago it received $4,000,000 
for small parks and playgrounds, Since that time it has received $2,500,000 
additional, West Park has received $3,000,000, and North Parks $500,009, 
making $10,000,000 in all. This increase of $6,000,000 over the original 
appropriation seems to show that Chicago believes in her new system, and 
is ready to tax herself for its support and increase. 
5. Compine Beauty ano Urimiry. One of the first features to 
strike the eye of the visitor is that this park playground has the beauty of 
the park and the utility of the playground at the same time. It is, in fact,

playground for all ages and sexes, and yet so beautiful that it seems like 
an oasis in the coal-grimed desert of South Chicago. Each of them is 
surrounded by a high iron fence, but even now the fence is so far concealed 
by trees, flowers and shrubs that it can scarcely be seen from the inside, 
and soon it will entirely disappear. On entering one is first impressed by 
the athletic field, where baseball and tennis are played during the summer, 
football and tennis in the fall, and skating and tobogganing are enjoyed in 
winter. The water is sprayed on with a hose, so that the ice is frozen as 
soon as the thermometer drops one or two degrees below the freezing point. 
As these parks are in crowded sections the ice is literally covered with 
skaters. A slide is erected at one edge for tobogganing. ‘The shelier house 
on one side is closed in and heated for the skaters and coasters.

  HARDIN SQUARE—A RECENT SOUTH PARK PLAYGROUND 
6. Ovrpoor Gymnasium For MEN. A second notable feature is 
the athletic field and gymnasium for men. This is also surrounded, as are 
each of the features of the playground, by a high fence of sharp iron pickets. 
This field is surrounded by what they claim is the best running track ip 
the world and which is certainly among the best. The outdoor gymnasium 
is large and complete, with every detail of outdoor gymnasium equipment. 
There is a separate place for each field event, such as putting the shot, the 
high and broad jump, pole vaulting, etc. 
Not far from this is the outdoor gymnasium for women and girls, 
which is similarly equipped but smaller, and with more features intended 
for play rather than systematic exercise. 
7. Piaycrounn ror SmMaLt Cunpren. A fourth feature is the play- 
ground for small children, also surrounded with a high iron fence, an 
equipped with all the most improved forms of playground apparatus. — In 
the center is a good sized wading pool. Running nearly around this is @ 
concrete sand bin often as much as 150 feet in length and 15 feet in width.
-P-A-G-E-72
THE RECREATION PARKS OF CHICAGO 73 
  NATURE'S SUMMER OCCUPATION FOR CHILDREN 
It is covered with an awning. Around this on a concrete platform runs 
a concrete seat for mothers who come to put their children in the sand while 
they sit on the bench and sew, or read or watch the children. 
8. Ovurpoor SwiauNne Poor. The outdoor swimming pool is the 
most popular feature of the whole playground during the summer months. 
It is a concrete pond a litile less than a half an acre in size and ranging 
from three to eight feet in depth. It is surrounded by a beach of white sand 
in which the bathers burrow and bask as they do on the sea shore. Around 
this are some iwo or three hundred bathing booths. The gateway into the 
pool is through a shower house containing some ten or fifteen showers, 
through which everyone is required to pass in going into the pool. Just 
outside are the waiting benches where about 200 people are usually collected 
during the middle of the day waiting for an opportunity to go into the pool. 
Each group of bathers is given an hour, and then, at the sound of the gong, 
they leave the pool and another set of bathers take possession of it. The 
park furnishes bathing suits, towels and soap. It is open four days a week 
for men and two days for women and children. The pool is lighted by 
electric lights and is open until 9:30 every evening. The attendance ranges 
between 500 and 1500 daily. 
9. Frecp Houses. The most notable and distinctive feature of 
these new parks, however, is thie field house. These field houses cost about 
$90,000 apiece. ‘The material used in nine out of ten buildings is concrete 
and the roofs are green mottled tiles. The approach is by a broad flight of 
steps extending almost the whole length of the building. On entering one 
is struck by the magnificent color scheme and the wonderful harmonies of 
the reds, browns, greens and blues and other colors which have been used

in the decoration. The broad entrance hall contains a circular rack of 
potted plants which enlivens the interior and reminds one that he is in a 
park. At one side of the entrance is a restaurant or lunch room at which 
such small refreshments as soups, sandwiches, coffee, ice cream and pie 
areserved. All of these viands are sold at cost. A five-cent dish of ice cream 
which is made by the park department, is said to be the best ice cream in 
Chicago and is certainly delicious. So excellent is this simple lunch room 
that many working people in the vicinity are now going there for their 
lunches in place of going to other restaurants. The settlement workers 
say that they are having a strong influence against the saloons; that the 
people find it a pleasant place to come and sit down and have a cup of 
coffee or a dish of ice cream, and that the attractive surroundings give it 
advantages over the saloons. 
10. Brancn or Pusiic Lisrary. On the other side of the entrance, 
in a number of buildings, is a branch of the Chicago public library. All of 
these libraries are used to the fullest extent and the Chicago librarian, 
Mr. Hurt, says that the one criticism which he has is that the rooms are not 
large enough to hold the people who wish to make use of them. I can testify 
for my own part that in the libraries which I visited there was scarcely a 
vacant seat. 
11. Inpoor Gymnasium ror Men. At one end of the building is a 
gymnasium for men. This is completely equipped with the best modern 
apparatus, so arranged that the apparatus goes up on pulleys to the ceiling, 
thus leaving. a clear floor for games of basketball, indoor baseball, etc. 
Just off from this are the best steel lockers which can be had, five or six 
shower baths, and a plunge pool usually about 15 to 20 feet in length. 
At the other end of the building there is exactly the same equipment 
for women.

  THE FIELD HOUSE 
Sherman Park 
12. Auprrortum anp Cius Rooms. Sometimes on the ground floor, 
but more often on the second floor, is a large auditorium with movable chairs 
which is used for public lectures or public meetings of any kind, or for 
dances or social gatherings. One of the greatest perils of South Chicago, 
as of most cities, is its dance halls. These halls are generally connected 
with saloons and often with Turkish or Russian baths as well. The South 
Park System is offering to the people a clean, attractive, well-lighted hall 
which may be used for any neighborhood purpose where the best influences 
prevail. They have already done much to lessen the use of the surround- 
ing dance halls, and it is hoped that they will soon be able to close many 
of them, Off from the auditorium are four or five club rooms. 
A notable feature about the use of the new parks, and especially the 
field houses, is that the ones in the better sections of the city are most used. 
In Hamilton Park, which is surrounded by a professional and business 
population of men who are supposed to earn from two to five thousand 
dollars a year, all of the features of the field house are now used almost 
to their full capacity. 
18. Supervision anp Maintenance. The keeping of this system 
is fully up to the level of the plan itself. Every part of it is faultlessly clean. 
Every piece of apparatus is tested every morning before the children are 
allowed in. During the summer time there are from fourteen to twenty 
attendants in every one of these playground parks. There are three life 
savers at the swimming pools. There is one who has charge of the shower- 
bath house and several attendants at the bathing booths themselves. There 
are three janitors, and a force of three or four men who mark out the running

THE RECREATION PARKS OF CHICAGO vue 
tracks, tennis courts, care for the approaches, etc. There is a manager 
in charge of the building. Gymnasium instructors from May to November 
have charge of the outdoor gymnasium and fields, and from November 
until May they have charge of the indoor gymnasiums. The hours are from 
2:00 to 9:30 in summer and from 3:30 to 9:30 in winter. All of these instruc- 
tors are a high type of men and women, most of them being college graduates. 
They are receiving, at present, $1,100 a year. Every part of the playground 
is open until 9:30 at night. On Sundays there is a special director who is an 
assistant to the regular athletic director and who takes charge of the work 
on that day. 
If one may venture a criticism of this truly magnificent system, it is 
that the children’s playgrounds are much in need of kindergartens, and 
that, as in many cities, there is great scarcity of well-trained and experi- 
enced social organizers. (Chicago is now taking steps to remedy this 
need.—Eprror.) 
There can be no doubt but that Chicago appreciates its new 
system of playgrounds. ‘The attendance has doubled every year to date. 
$6,000,000 for improvement has been voted Chicago since the first parks 
were completed, and the new parks are to be made larger and better than 
those now finished.

CHAPTER XI 
Prayarounps Down In THE BLUE Grass 
“IN OLD KAINTUCK” 
Maneune McDowe.t BrecKENRIDGE 
The playgrounds of Lexington present some very unique features. The one in which they are 
absolutely unique we think is that a system arks has been created as the result of establishing of 
playggounds. Mrs. Desha Breckenridge who has been the inspiration and the motive force tells us 
about the movement,—Eaditor. 
The first playground in Lexington was started in the summer of 1901 
in the section of the city known as Irishtown. It was a typical Kentucky 
playground, located in the shadow of a distillery, and attended before the 
close of the season with many stormy incidents. The first superintendent 
resigned his job in a few weeks. He had come to the conclusion that the 
neighborhood was not “ healthy” for him. The second superintendent, a 
college athlete, got along famously until the father of a large boy, whom he 
had picked out of a scrimmage with some little boys and put off the grounds, 
vowed vengeance. This father was known as a bad man. He had pre- 
viously killed his man and escaped the penitentiary. Discretion on the 
part of the supervisor seemed the better part of valor; but the committee 
concluded that the moral effect on Irishtown of another supervisor resigning 
would be disastrous. They employed an assistant supervisor who was in 
reality a deputy sheriff. The two young men hunted in pairs, going to and 
from Irishtown always together and letting it be known by way of a peace argument that their hip pockets were equipped in true Kentucky fashion. 
The playground committee with this first year’s experience had not 
only every problem that may arise in runing ‘a playground, but it had 
gotten immediately into the midst of the whole Sunday question. When, 
the second year, the piece of property on which the playground had been 
held was offered for sale, an old saloon man across the street bought it and 
refused even to rent to the playground people. He did not like their in- 
fluence in Irishtown and he thought he was getting rid of them. But a stip 
of a house was found with a tiny yard, and a vacation school with a little 
children’s playground in the yard was conducted. It may be mentioned 
here that there had been no public school in this section of the town. The 
playground committee induced the school board that autumn to start @ 
kindergarten that has grown into a school of a hundred and fifty pupils 
and that will be much larger when the new school building is erected. 
The school board has appropriated $10,000 for this building and an effort 
is being made by the Civic League to raise $20,000 on the outside. It 1 
planned that the building shall contain a carpenter shop, a kitchen, a laun- 
dry, shower baths, an assembly room, and if possible a swimming pool and 
78 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
PLAYGROUNDS DOWN IN THE BLUE GRASS 19 
accommodations for library and club rooms. The baths, the wash tubs, 
the auditorium, etc., are to be used by the adults of the community out of 
school hours; and if the plans of the Civic League are carried out the school 
house will become virtually the social settlement house of that community. 
When, the second summer, the playground of Irishtown was turned 
into a vacation school, another playground was started on what is known 
as the city dump, a piece of land which the city was fast selling off, the 
remnant of which the Civic League hoped in this way to preserve for park 
purposes. It succeeded, and that land is now planned as a, beautiful little 
interior playground with swimming pool, shelter house, etc. The third 
summer the Civic League placed a third playground on what is now Wood- 
land Park, a piece of land which it desired the city to buy as a park. This 
has happened. The park with its splendid old trees has been put in order 
and beautified and is being greatly enjoyed by the people. * * * 
The first year the playground was supported by the Civic League and 
the Woman’s Club, or rather by private subscriptions collected by them. 
The second year the Civic League assumed the expenses, the Woman’s 
Club contributing in some measure. The third year a city appropriation 
was obtained, and now the $800.00 annually paid over by the city to the 
Civic League for the maintenance of the playgrounds is supplemented 
simply from private sources. 
It is perhaps not too much to claim that three important things have 
grown out of the little playground work started in Irishtown in the summer 
of 1901. The creation of a Park Commission and the embryonic park 
system which Lexington now has are in a large measure the result of the 
playground movement and the agitation kept up by the Civic League 
through the hearty codperation of the newspapers. The introduction of 
manual training into all the public schools, white and colored, of Lexington 
is one outgrowth of the humble work started in Irishtown and of the con- 
tinual pressure and agitation of the Civic League. The system is not yet 
complete as the school board has not been able to equip all the school 
buildings for cooking and wood work, but it has been started on the right 
principle and some hand work is given to both races and.both sexes in every 
grade from the kindergarten through the high school. And last, but not 
least, the model school planned for Irishtown, or rather for the whole sec- 
tion of the city known as the West End, which embodies the very newest 
ideas as to the function of the public school will, if consummated, be a step 
very far in advance. It will have its effect not only on the school system 
of Lexington, but on the schools of this whole section of the state.

“However difficult it may be to interpret America to the 
recent arrivals from other countries; however difficult it may 
be to unite our adult population on public issues of the day 
affecting the common weal, they may be unified most easily 
on those things which affect the interests of children, And 
the children’s playgrounds not only help in unifying our adult 
population, but they interpret fundamental American ideals 
to all concerned. ‘The central ideal in America is that we 
are self-governed people. We are governed by laws made by 
our own people, and we appoint officials to enforce the laws.

must be removed. This can usually be done by some wrecking company 
who will buy them. If you wish to use the materials for other buildings it 
would be better to have it done under your own auspices. 
The city engineer’s office will give a plan of the land showing the exact 
size, grades of the streets, general city specifications, etc. 
Also from the city engineer’s office may be obtained other information 
which would be valuable, as follows: 
Established grades of streets at all corners. 
Established grades of property line on all corners of the playgrounds, and the established 
grades of property lines on proy exactly across the street from these corners. 
Actual grades Of the same places, erty ° 
. From the city engineer also obtain information as to the probability of 
bringing those streets up to grade in the near future (the established grades 
in all cities are usually much higher than the actual grades, and it is quite the custom after houses have been built on the hills to lower the grades 
because the people who have secured houses on the hills do not want dirt 
dug out from under them.) The land secured for playgrounds will usually 
be below grade. . 
Secure from the water department the following information: 
Exact location of water connections. 
Sizé of main. 
Depth of water main, 
Size and location of outlets, (Also “work” them for all the second-hand pipe you can 
get, as it is good for fences.) 
From the sewer department get the following information: 
Location of sewers. 
Depth of sewers below actual grade and below established grade. 
Size of pipes. 
Location and size of outlets. 
Also city specifications for making catch basins and sewers, 
2. Dratnace. If the land is much below grade and filling is scarce, 
it.can be made a sunken garden with catch basins and sewer connections 
so that it drains to the center. If it is on a side hill, it should be graded so 
that the gymnasium and space for children’s games is level. The baseball 
diamond and running track should be one to two feet below the rest of the 
grounds, sloping at a grade of four inches to a hundred feet to a point 
near the center just outside the infield of the baseball diamond, where 2 
catch basin is located and connected with the sewer. The manhole should 
have two covers, one to drain the field in the summer time and the other 
without holes to be used when the field is flooded. 
After the land has been graded, a water system should be installed.

Two iron pipes or rods at least one and one-quar- 
ter inches (1} in.) in diameter shall be inserted in 
the brick work at a height of four feet (4 ft.) from 
the bottom as indicated in the plan. Two other 
rods for steps shall be inserted in the brick work 
as indicated in the plan. ‘Che manhole cover shall 
be cast solid and shall have a hole drilled near the 
center through which a one and one-half inch (14 
in.) eve bolt shall be inserted. Through the flanges 
of the manhole top two (2) eye bolts shall be in- 
serted with one and one-half inch (13 in.) eyes 
coming just above the surface of the ground. The 
bolt from the top of the flange to the surface of the 
ground shall be imbedded in concrete. All eye bolts 
must be made of iron at least one-half inch (4 in.) 
in diameter. The bottom of the box shall be made 
of concrete. A one and one-half inch (1} in.) Jead 
water pipe shall be connected and extended from 
the city water main at the property line into the 
meter box and a one and one-half inch (14 in.) 
gal. pipe shall extend through with the necessary 
connections to a distance of one foot beyond the 
other side of the box, from which point a gal. iron 
stand pipe one and one-half inches (14 in.) in di- 
ameter shall extend to a height of eighteen inches 
(i8 in.) above the surface of the ground and shall 
have at the ends a connection for a one and one- 
half inch (14 in.) hose, water to be turned on and 
off with a key. Inside the water box the construc- pan OF BRICK METER BOX

meter and a tee with a plug in the end of it 
shall be placed on the other side; beyond this an automatic drip valve shall be placed 
which may be opened and closed by an iron rod extending to the top of the box. Outside 
of this shall be placed a one and one-half by one and one-half by seven-eighths (14 x 14 x 3) 
reducing tee with a plug in the end of it. All connections and fittings to be of malleable 
iron and placed as indicated in the appended plan and all work to be done in a thoroughly 
workmanship manner, and finished not later than ————— 
4. Warer System. The water system can be either a gravity system 
which is the cheapest, or it may be the system which is usually used in parks, 
with the pipes all below the freezing line. The latter system is more satis- 
factory but the other is somewhat cheaper and answers the purpose. There 
should be provision made for flooding the skating rink; the plan above 
with specifications shows the method which we have used in St. Paul. 
We made no provision in this for connection with the sewer which was a bad 
mistake. There should be inserted in the specifications provision for a 
cesspool trap, and very small connection with the sewer. This meter box 
can have the top filled with hay above the planks in the winter time so that 
the water can be turned on and off without danger of freezing. 
Street washers should be placed about one hundred feet apart over 
the space which is to be watered. It is not convenient to handle much 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
84 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
over fifty feet of hose. Care should be taken and not have any of the 
street washers project above the surface of the baseball field as they 
will cause accidents. They can sometimes be placed below the surface 
in a box which will have a sod on top, so that it will not hurt any one if 
they fall upon it. 
5. Rerarnine a Store. Good sod, of course, is the best thing for 
retaining a slope, but it is quite expensive. A bank one and one-half by 
one can be planted with grass but it is quite apt to wash. For a very steep 
or a very long slope where it is not absolutely necessary to have a velvet 
surface alfalfa can be planted, in sections where it will grow. In other 
parts of the country red clover might be used. Both of these plants have 
extremely long roots. A lawn mixture in which clover predominates is 
the best for use on an embankment. Where there is not sufficient room 
for a slope a concrete retaining wall may be used, but it is expensive. 
B. Piayine SurFraces 
wi Runninc Track. There are three kinds of running tracks 
which may be used. 
a. The cinder track which should be made as follows: There should 
bea bed of dirt or small stones, a layer of sod placed edgewise on this; over 
this should be placed a layer of coarse cinders four to six inches deep, and 
on top of this a layer of fine cinders which have been screened through a 
one-half inch screen should be spread to the depth of two or three inches. 
The whole surface should be thoroughly rolled with a heavy roller. A 
cinder track is very hard to keep in shape. , 
b. Clay. Place clay on top of soil or dirt. This is apt to be pretty muddy for playground use. 
c. The best track which we know of is a mixture of cinders and clay 
made as follows: 
_ Three or four inches of coarse cinders, well packed and covered with one inch of cinders 
which have been run through a half-inch screen will make a hard surface over a sand} 
bottom. If equal parts of screened cinders and good clay are mixed together, dampened, spread one inch thick over a layer of coarse cinders and well rolled, an ideal playing surface 
will be made for the athletic field, the running track or any part of the playground; such @ 
mixture packs well, is springy, does not get dusty in dry weather and can be played on 
in the rain. 
2. Basrpatt Dramonp. For the baseball field a good closely 
cropped turf is best, and is quite practicable if the playground is of sufficient 
size and not in a very thickly settled part of the city. ‘The base lines should 
be cut out and made with cinders and clay. If the baseball diamond is to 
be used extensively it should be made entirely of cinders and clay. This 
treatment for running tracks and baseball diamond also applies to the 
hockey field and skating rink. 
In some places sand and clay can be used to a better advantage than 
cinders and clay, as follows: About 2 parts of coarse sand and 1 part of 
good clay mixed; this is especially valuable for running tracks and walks.
-P-A-G-E-84
CONSTRUCTION METHODS 85 
In the Chicago playgrounds they are using a mixture of clay and cinders 
and on top they are putting a layer of very coarse sand sometimes called 
binding sand or torpedo sand. 
Cinders will often be hauled to the ground for nothing in the winter and dumped in 
place. Get from hotels, factories and lighting plants. Are often used for concrete in the 
building season, hence expensive. 
*3. Unpxer Swines. The swings must have very hard surfaces under 
them or in a few days great holes will be worn in the ground to fill with 
water every time it rains. We have used a strip of cement sidewalk about 
three feet wide which works like a charm. It is so narrow that if the chil- 
dren fall out of the swings they fall beyond the sidewalk. 
~4, Unper Giant Srrives. The giant stride is subject to the same 
condition of use which applies to the swing. We have settled this problem in 
two ways. We placed around one giant stride a bed of screened cinders and 
clay, equal parts mixed and spread to a depth of eight inches. This worked 
admirably on a hard soil for a foundation. In case the subsoil is sandy 
we would suggest that a bed of coarse cinders about eight inches deep be 
put underneath the top dressing. Another treatment which we used was 
to make a concrete runway about 3 feet wide entirely around the giant 
stride. This was placed just where the children would run on it. It had 
a big hole in the center which was filled with soft sand and the space outside 
of the runway was also filled with sand. The runway itself was placed on 
an incline. This seemed to answer the purpose very well, but the cinders 
and clay treatment seemed to give as good results at less cost. 
~5. Unper Sez-saws. The space under the see-saws should be filled 
with soft sand to a depth of about six to ten inches. This can be kept in 
place by means of narrow cement curbing or planks, which should be 
placed at least four feet from the ends of the see-saws. 
~ 6. Unper Fryinc Durcuman. The runway around the post should 
be a circle 6 feet in diameter made of cinders and clay, or of concrete. 
The one who runs around and furnishes power for the flying Dutch- 
man will run on this runway which should be on a slant. Outside of 
this extending around a distance of four feet beyond the flying dutchman 
should be placed a small curbing and the space between filled with soft sand. 
“7. Unper Gymnasium. The surface under the gymnasium appa- 
ratus should be of sand eight to ten inches deep. This should be kept in 
place by a retaining curb or plank allowing three feet of space outside of all 
apparatus. ‘The only exception to this would be under the trick rings, 
which should have a hard dirt surface directly under them:in order to enable 
the children to swing by striking with their feet. This surface, however, 
should be cinders and clay and not concrete. 
8. Basxerpatt Court. The basketball court requires a very hard 
surface. Cement would be best but would be rather expensive. We
-P-A-G-E-85
86 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
used cinders and clay in the proportion before mentioned but would suggest 
that it would be better to use two parts of clay to one part of cinders for 
the top dressing. 
9. Tennis Courts. Tennis courts should have a drainage founda- 
tion of coarse cinders 4 to 6 inches deep, well packed and rolled after being 
dampened. This drainage foundation should lead off on a slope in several 
places so as to carry away surplus water. On top of the coarse cinders 
spread fine cinders mixed with clay, 2 parts clay to 1 part cinders, level and 
then roll. In order to keep the horse off the tennis court hitch a long rope 
to the handle of the roller so that he can do all the rolling from the outside 
without stepping on the court. 
The clay which we have always used was yellow molding clay but we 
should judge that common gray or blue clay would answer the purpose 
just as well. It would not, however, be quite so sticky perhaps and we 
would advise you before using any clays to mix up a small amount and test. 
In the west the common adobe soil answers the purpose of clay but is 
not quite so sticky and would probably require a little larger proportion 
to the cinders. 
Ina very dry country we would recommend that the proportion of clay 
be increased and that salt should be mixed with the surfacing to conserve 
the moisture. " 
We have always done the mixing by hand but should judge that it 
could be put in a concrete mixer or it might be necessary to make a special 
mixer. 
10. For Games. Grass is without question the best surface on 
which to play games, and it can be maintained under certain conditions. 
Our experience in Louisville was as follows. We had a plot of grass in 
the center of the park which was about seventy-five yards across. We al- 
lowed the children to play on this grass six hours per day while the play 
instructors were there. After the six hours had expired they were kept off 
and the park keepers tenderly watered the surface and kept it in shape. 
For three months this playground had an average attendance of 425 
children who played on this grass all the time, basketball, baseball, hockey, 
races and all manner of games. At the end of the season the grass was 
a little bit brown around the bases and the runs which we had not treated 
in any special manner. In a few other places especially under the trees 
it was slightly worn. This was in an especially dry summer. 
In order to maintain grass the ground must be covered with about 
eight inches of black dirt. 
11. Dancers. Grass also makes the best surface for dancing, and 
should be used whenever possible. A little separate green could be very 
well reserved for this purpose. In this connection we have considered 
the possibility of making a combination skating rink and dancing pavilion. 
This could be made of concrete so that in the winter time it could be flooded 
for ice skating and in the summer time it could be used for roller skating
-P-A-G-E-86

Louisville 
and for dancing. It should have a roof and the sides could be covered 
with vines. Summer gymnasium classes could also be given in this pavilion. 
12, Artistic Tennis Courts. Tennis courts, on account of the 
back stops used, are generally an eye sore in any park. The treatment 
used in Hartford, which consists of running vines over them, makes a very 
artistic feature. The vines used can be Virginia creeper, woodbine, Kundz 
viné, or annuals such as morning-glory and wild cucumber. (See page 122.) 
13. Swrumine Poors. The construction of swimming pools is best 
taken up in the little book as follows: 
1997'S BaNNG Poois. By John K, Allen, 63 pp. 50 cents. Chicago. Domestic Engineering, 
This little handbook outlines briefly the construction of swimming pools; their mechanical in- stallation, water supply, heating the water, various types of installations adapted to different condi- tions, with thirty illustrations and charts. . More than half the book is devoted to the discussion of methods of heating and modes of cal- 
culation of the amount of heat required. The section discussing various safe methods of construction & equally valuable as it abounds in accurate information as to adaptability of materials, errors to 1 avoided, ete. oo. . In brief, this compact little book may be characterized as filled with accurate technical informa- tion on Swimming Pools. No public library should be without it, and no one planning to build a natatorium should fai] to read it before making any plans for construction. 
A recent patent on a method for securing surface drainage for swimming pools has just 
been awarded. The ideal surface drain is one extending entirely around the tank, without 
a break at the normal water Jevel. When such a drain is not provided the dirt is washed 
against the walls of the tank and the grease and scum have to be scrubbed off. This new 
method obviates the difficulty and the rounded edge serves as a life rail in place of the metal rail usually in use. A manufacturing firm is prepared to install such a combined life rail 
aud gutter.—(Editor.)

1. Improvements CompteTep. This Denver playground presents 
a problem in playground engineering, the successful solution of which 
makes possible the utilization of odds and ends of land for playgrounds, 
which are below grade and unsuitable for building purposes. The block 
used for this playground lies on two slopes sidling both ways, with the lowest 
part at the corner of W. 39th avenue and Navajo street, where the actual 
grade of the property is eighteen feet to twenty feet below the established 
grade and three or four feet below the actual grade of the before-mentioned 
streets which are unimproved. The property line at the corners of W. 38th 
with Osage and Navajo streets is practically the established grade and 
somewhat above the established grades of the streets. 
Baseball in this part of the city is the only game interesting the boys. 
The field is so small that grading on two levels left no room for baseball, 
so a grade was selected which would utilize all of the available dirt, making 
the grounds practically level and not too far below the grades which would 
obtain if the ungraded streets were improved. When the street improve- 
ments are made, the corner of W. 39th and Navajo will be about three feet 
below the street. It now is, after grading the field level, about ten feet 
above the present grade of the streets, on an average. In order to hold the 
soil where the grounds are above the present grades, slopes were made, in 
some places eighteen feet high. These banks were sowed thickly with 
alfalfa and the long roots serve to keep the soil from washing, thus saving 
the expense of a retaining wall. 
When all the streets are improved, these banks will be entirely filled 
and a slope made leading from the surfaces of the playground to the edge 
of the street, so that the places now above actual grade will then be some- 
what below the established grade. 
The entire surface drains to the center of the athletic field, where a 
catch basin can be made directly over the sewerage system already installed. 
During the first four months of the time I was in Denver, the grounds 
were graded level; the border of trees planted, consisting of white maples 
with Carolina poplars alternating on the south and west sides. A gym- 
nasium frame, purchased and erected by my predecessor, was taken down 
and reset in the proper place. Girls’ swings, see-saws, baby swings, giant 
strides, were manufactured and erected according to the plan. A merry-go-

round and slide were installed later. A fence with iron pipe posts and wire 
netting surmounted with barbed wire was erected around the entire play- 
ground. 
2. Improvements Prosecrep. The plan calls for the following 
additional improvements: cinder and clay walk and 12-lap to the mile 
running track laid outside of athletic and baseball field. A border of 
grass to be made around 
the edges of this track with 
shrubbery grouped in 
places indicated. A drink- 
ing fountain to be installed 
with vine-covered wire 
screen to protect it from 
the baseball field. 
Connecting the athletic 
field to the projected field 
house is to be a small con- 
crete arch bridging the 
wading and swimming 
pool. *A high wire fence 
covered with vines and 
HOME MADE MERRY-GO-ROUND acting as a backstop and 
. . screen will keep baseballs 
from entering the girls’ playground and the boys’ gymnasium. A hedge 
around the girls’ playground will act as a screen to insure seclusion. Climb- 
ing vines will be planted next to the fence around the entire playground. 
Shrubbery and trees for shade complete the interior landscaping projected. 
A water system must be installed, then the vines and shrubs are put in, and 
temporary toilet accommodations must be put in to serve until other Denver 
playgrounds are partially developed, when a permanent bath house and 
gymnasium with outdoor wading and swimming pools can be constructed. 
_ As soon as the surrounding streets are graded, boulevards and street 
lines of trees, not indicated in the plan, will be planted. 
The improvements completed were put in at an expense of $2,000 to 
$3,000, most of which sum was spent ongrading. The land cost $7,500 and 
the value of this land was assessed upon property in the district benefited. 
This is the first playground in Denver to be made on land owned by 
the city. Denver has maintained in addition, a playground on leased land 
and is now expending over $250,000 on sites for new playgrounds.

Playground Architects 
1. Firsr Arremprs. The present playground movement in St. Paul 
had its beginning in a parlor conference held by the Associated Charities. 
As a result of the interest shown at this meeting, two playgrounds were 
equipped with funds raised by subscription. One of these was carried 
on in connection with a social settlement and was quite successful, but 
was abandoned in a year or two on account of the land being required for 
other purposes. The other playground was a decided failure on account of 
lack of supervision, and as it became a crime breeder, it was dismantled. 
2. Pusric Barus anp Piayerounps. Realizing the need of play- 
grounds and baths in that part of the city in which this unsuccessful play- 
ground was located, Dr. J. H. Ohage, the Health Commissioner, saw 
possibilities in an island in the Mississippi about eight or ten acres in extent. 
This island he purchased and equipped as a public bath and playground, 
along distinctively German traditions. Harriet Island was later turned over 
to the city, improved and maintained by it during warm weather under the 
supervision of the Health Department. “The Public Baths” have always 
been a very valuable feature in St. Paul’s recreative life. 
3. Tux Presenr Movement. The members of the Civic League 
under the leadership of Mrs. Conde Hamlin, feeling that the Public Baths 
did not reach all parts of the city and were limited in scope, met with the 
officers of The Commercial Club and organized in October, 1903, a Joint 
Playground Committee as follows: 
Representing the Civic League: *Mrs. Wm. E. Bramhall, Mrs. Alex. Barclay, Mrs. 
W. E. Howard. 
Representing the Commercial Club: Frederick G. Bradbury, Secretary, Paul N. Myers, 
Treasurer, Bishop H. Schriber. 
Frederick Nussbaumer, Superintendent of Public Parks. 
Arthur W. Dunning, M.D., Chairman. Each oue of this committee was also a member 
of a larger committee in each organization. 
Profiting by the inauspicious beginnings of the two small playgrounds, 
they decided that the enterprise should be a municipal one, and following 
this idea, the committee appeared before the City Conference Committee 
and received an appropriation of $2,500 for the purpose of starting a system 
of public playgrounds. 
4. How Lanp Was Securrp. The city owned an old haymarket 
site 125 x 300 feet in area, comprising half of a small block. This site was 
turned over to the Committee to be used as a playground.

that supervision was the most valuable feature to successful playground 
operation, the committee secured a trained supervisor.

  When the work of construction was definitely outlined, it was dis- 
covered that the City Council had turned over io the Playground Committee, 
the land on which the city engineer had his storehouse and lumber yard. 
It was impossible to use the ground for both purposes or to dislodge the 
engineer; furthermore the piece of land was entirely too small and the rest 
of the block being built up, there was absolutely no chance for enlargement.
-P-A-G-E-93
94 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
The situation is shown by the accompanying plan of the Como Avenue Playground, 
(4) being the haymarket site and (5) the city engineer’s storevard (page 93). 
After investigating the adjacent vacant lots, two triangles of land were discovered, (1) 
and (2) in the plan. These had been purchased by the Board of Park Commissioners in order 
to secure frontage for the proposed boulevarding of Como Avenue. A plan showing possi- 
bilities for playground development of these triangles, which called for the alteration of the 
intervening streets, and exchange of block 4 for block 5, also vacant, was prepared and 
submitted to the Superintendent of Parks. 
  The Superintendent had no objection to the use of this land provided 
no permanent improvements were included. As the plan called for perman- 
ent improvements, the matter was not presented to the Park Board until 
the Chairman of the Park Commission and creator of St. Paul Parks, 
the late Hon. J. A. Wheelock, returned to the city from a health trip. The 
matter was immediately submitted to him and received his heartiest com- 
mendation. In fact, he said, “I bought those pieces of land for a play- 
ground.” Each member of the Park Board was visited with the plan and 
they authorized the use of the land in question as a playground. 
One of ‘the hardest Rroblems of the year was the exchange of plot 4 for plot 3 as each lot in 3 was owned by different people.” A special appropriation was secured to make the 
engineer’s yard smaller and finally the exchange was effected without cost to the city. 
6. Grapine, Lanpscarr GARDENING AND BurLpINes. 
About 1300 loads of filling and 200 loads of loam were hauled in, bringing triangle 2 up to grade. The borders were sodded and the edges seeded; 15 elm trees, 90 lilacs and 30 buckthorns were planted around the border, suggestive of a hedge, which was to be made by filling in the interspaces when more money could be secured. The grading and landscape lening was done at a cost of $457.29. A small plavhouse, as shown in the illustrations, w: i as, was erected at a cost of $815.04... The floor plan of this is seen on page 96 and the elevation opposite. The superstructure is of wood with shingled roof ani drop siding. 
The outside is painted a dark bronze green, with lighter bronze green trimmings. ‘The windows are large with diamond panes and red sashes. (We do not recommend red sashes 
for the red excites the boys, so that they try and see how near they can come to the sashes 
with sling shots.) 
The inside walls show the planed siding and studding which are stained dark green. A cement floor 33 x 35 feet serves as a foundation to the building and also as a veranda, en- 
closed within which are the sand boxes, The overhanging roof gives partial protection from sun and storm. 
The building is divided into a large central play room 16 x 16 feet (which, owing to lack of other storage room was used at night for the storage of apparatus). At each side of 
the pay room are toilet rooms for the boys and for the girls, each with shower bath and 
drinking water. 
7. Puay Equrement. The facilities for play included sand boxes, 
illustrated on page 97, a giant stride, a gymnasium frame made of old 
bridge beams, illustrated on page 99, a set of 9 swings on iron pipe 
frames, illustrated on page 98, a Flying Dutchman, illustrated on page 
91, a steel horizontal and vaulting bar, a pair of basketball goals, @ 
pair of parallel bars. Triangle 1 was used as a baseball diamond. The 
entire cost of this gymnasium apparatus and athletic supplies was $179.40, 
(it is needless to say that the work was home made and that most of it was 
done by the supervisor with the assistance of the children). However, 
the quality of most of the equipment was good, and most of it is still in use 
after six years’ time.

and for two weeks the newspapers boomed the playground benefit game- 
Incidentally we netted $400. 
10. CHarrer AMENDMENT. By an act of the Minnesota legislature 
passed in 1899 and 1903, the judges of the district court appoint a committee 
of fifteen freeholders who act as a charter commission to frame and submit 
to popular election necessary amendments to the city charter. The Play- 
ground Committee went before this commission at its last meeting and

secured the insertion of the following amendment to the list of fourteen 
already drafted for last fall’s election: 
To provide and maintain public playgrounds and places of recreation 
for children and to levy the necessary tax to support the same, not exceeding 
in any one year the sum of $10,000.

This much accomplished, another campaign of publicity was necessary, 
for in order to become operative each amendment required three-fifths of 
all the votes cast in the city. Failure to vote for an amendment is equal 
to a negative vote. 
The state and county officers were to be elected; some amendments 
to the state constitution, besides the fifteen charter amendments, were to 
be voted upon and altogether fifty crosses were required for the whole ticket. 
The chances looked dubious for the measure at the “tail-end of the heap.” 
Undaunted, the committee, headed by its Chairman, Dr. Dunning of 
the Commercial Club and Mrs. Bramhall, President of the Civic League, 
took up the task. Its amendment, along with the others, was considered

trade unions and other commercial bodies. The Ministers’ Association 
took it-up and some of the members preached playgrounds from their pul- 
pits. Letters from prominent people telling the value of playgrounds 
and the importance of the playground amendment were published. Each 
of the papers gave us editorial space. The committee, supervisor and 
park board delivered campaign speeches.

11. Tue Cumpren Secure Vorss. All this we felt was falling 
short of accomplishment and it was decided to make a direct appeal to the 
voters, those interested in the 25,000 school children in the city. To this 
intent circulars and dodgers were prepared and made as attractive to chil-
-P-A-G-E-99
100 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFY 
dren and parents as we could devise. Obtaining permission from the school 
board, the leaflets were given out by the teachers to the children with instruc- 
tions to take them home to fathers and big brothers. 
Two weeks later the count was completed. Only six of the fifteen 
amendments passed and the playground measure showed a margin of 
seventeen votes. When the conference committee met to prepare the tax 
budget they gave us the charter limit of $10,000. The council first talked 
of cutting it down to $2,500, but such a storm of protest was raised that the 
full appropriation passed. 
The successful passage of the measure was attributed to the campaign- 
ing of the children. 
12. Pusziciry. Of course the most effective factor in securing this 
favorable public sentiment was due to the successful playground work 
inaugurated and to the publicity given the playground movement. 
Throughout the season all possible use was made of the daily press. 
Editors and reporters were given the news before it became history. During 
the period of construction the different papers showed the progress of the 
work by means of half-tone illustrations. 
Our endeavor was always to keep the playgrounds in the public eye. 
An incomplete collection of local press clippings shows one hundred and 
sixty-three items as to playgrounds published during the first six months. 
Every addition to our equipment—every game played—every plan organized 
everything, having any advertising value—was used. We tried to treat 
the papers impartially and planned to reach all sorts of readers by having 
playground news appear at different times in every department. In fact, 
one obliging city editor said he would “put our stuff in the want columns 
if we wished it.” 
In addition also to printed matter 30 or more photographs and draw- 
ings together with 6 cartoons let the St. Paul people know that there was 
“something doing” all the time on the public playground. 
18. Two Baszpati Leacurs Orcanizep. In order to make use 
of the sporting columns, and interest, through them, all parts of the city, 
we organized a city baseball league, having a team in each of eight differ- 
ent wards. This, with another league of teams from the vicinity of the 
playground, made an aggregate of sixteen teams who played some weeks 
as many as twenty games. Percentages were kept and the leading teams 
of each league given a pennant at the end of the season. Some of the 
games were played on this playground and some were played on vacant 
lots in various parts of the city. 
In order to successfully carry on the press work and organization of 
games the supervisor was obliged to spend most of his time away from 
the playground which seems to us to be the proper place for a general 
supervisor to spend most of his time.

14, Scoot Teams. The children in the Scheffer School were 
divided into three sides, the reds, whites and the blues. Each division had 
a boy and a girl team representing each grade. Games were scheduled 
and a record of points kept. The captains of each side were elected by 
popular vote amid wild excitement. By making scholarship a necessary 
qualification to playing on the team this competition can be a great help to 
school work. One of the teachers said that already she had noticed a more 
regular attendance on the part of some boys. 
15. Arrenpance. The playground was kept open 72$ days, the 
average attendance being for the mornings, 130; afternoons, 235; total, 365. 
16. FourrH or Jury Pray Fesrrvat. The Commercial Club, 
through its Playground Committee, has maintained for several years a 
Fourth of July Play Festival at the Public Baths. The supervisor of play- 
grounds was a member of this committee and appointed to confer with the 
Superintendent of the Public Baths, regarding the preparation of a program 
of sports. Two complete programs were made, one set of programs having 
for prizes gold and silver medals, while baseball bats, gloves, etc., were 
given for prizes for the other series of games. 
The Commercial Club raised some over $1,000.00 which was expended 
in giving the children a “free feed,” bunches of small fire-crackers and for 
music and fireworks. 
The children from all over the city were assembled early in the morning 
near the city hall and marched over the bridge, down to Harriet Island, 
where, in the midst of the river, pandemonium reigned supreme.

Nothing but very small fire-crackers and harmless noise makers were 
allowed on the Island. Any one transgressing was promptly ejected. The 
programs of athletic and aquatic sports kept the children busy and they 
were sent home early. This Fourth of July Play Festival seems to be a 
happy solution of what to do with the children on our great National Holi- 
day. Not a single serious accident resulted from the Fourth of July cele- 
bration throughout the city, which is now an annual affair.

17. Sources or Sr. Paui’s Success. In summing up the first 
year of playgrounds in St. Paul, during which by far the most valuable work 
was done, I should say that their keynote of success was the codperation 
of a great number of interested leagues, clubs, and allied associations. 
The joint committee was an enthusiastic body representing numerous
-P-A-G-E-102
THE EVOLUTION OF ST. PAUL PLAYGROUNDS 103 
allied interests and the supervisor was allowed to work out the technical 
details and the disposition of his time to the best interests of the play- 
grounds. 
Tur Srconp Yurar or Sr. Pauy’s PLaycrounps 
After the Playground Amendment was successfully passed, it was 
found that no provision had been made for the administration of the play- 
grounds. By a Charter provision, St. Paul is not allowed to create any new 
board or commission, or any salaried official thereof, hence the playgrounds 
must be administered by some board already in existence. 
18. Park Boarp anp Apvisory PLaycrounp Commitrer. As 
the President of the Park Board seemed to be very favorably disposed to 
playgrounds it was thought best to put them under its charge, with an 
advisory committee of three persons to advise with the Board of Park Com- 
missioners, on all matters which related exclusively to Public Playgrounds. 
The mayor appoints annually an advisory committee to act on play- 
grounds. The Park Board handles the accounts and appoints a supervisor 
who devotes all his time to the supervision and technical operation. 
The mayor was given full authority to appoint this committee and it 
was supposed that he would appoint the ones who had done the work on the 
old joint committee. 
19. Poxrrics. Unfortunately, the mayor had some political debts 
to pay. Two or three different men were offered a place on the committee 
but refused to accept. Finally two were secured, but while these were very 
good men they had not been connected with the other committee and 
so were entirely inexperienced. ‘The other position was tendered to one of 
the ladies of the Civic League, with a string tied to it that if she did not 
accept it would be offered to one of the men who had served on the previous 
committees. Naturally she did not care to accept the place. As a result 
of these appointments the playground movement lost both the backing of 
the Civic League and the Commercial Club and the advisory committee of 
three had absolutely no function other than that of giving advice. 
An advisory committee without official powers must have a substantial 
backing in order to carry weight. The work the second year consequently 
was much delayed and impeded by friction. At the request of the Park 
Board, the supervisor gave up his outside excursions, organizing teams, 
ete., and put in all his time on the one playground until the latter part of 
the summer when a new ground was opened. Considerable new apparatus 
was erected at the Como Avenue Playground including two giant strides, 
a set of baby swings, as illustrated in Chapter XXVI, a pair of parallel 
bars, a tennis set, and jumping standard. 
20. Nicur PLaycrounps. During the summer the playground was 
opened nights and two persons were expected to carry on the grounds from 
nine o’clock in the morning until half past eight at night.
-P-A-G-E-103
104 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
The night work is very valuable as it gives the bovs and girls who work 
daytimes an opportunity to use the grounds, but the disciplinary problems. 
at night on an unfenced playground are very serious ones. If is absolutely 
impossible for two people to keep order on a three and one-half acre play- 
ground and at the same time carry on a very highly organized system of 
games. Especially is this true when those same teachers have been actively 
at work in the playground a greater part of the day. 
About the middle of August on account of the opening of a new play- 
ground another assistant was secured and pending the delay in construction 
of the new grounds, he was utilized for a short time at the Como Avenue 
ground, and a number of teams as well as classes in horizontal bar, parallel 
bar, and other gymnastic work were organized. 
21. Snowrr Barus. The shower baths proved most popular in 
1905. The average number of baths taken daily was: Boys, 56; girls, 27; total, 83, 
_The two shower baths were worked io the limit of their capacity. 
Twice the number of baths could have been given had space permitted. 
. 22 PLaycrounp Setr-Government. In order to simplify the dis- 
cipline of the playground the children were formed into a body politic, a 
miniature municipality, with the power to elect their own officers and have 
a say in the making and enforcing of their own laws. 
One enterprising candidate for mayor formed his own party and got 
such a lead that no one else dared to start a party. It was also said that he 
promised political jobs to the 
available opposition candidates 
in addition to telling them that 
they had no hopes of victory. 
After some encouragement from 
the supervisor another candidate 
was found and a party formed 
to support him. The registra- 
tion commenced. All who were 
over eight and could read and 
write were allowed to vote. 
The electioneering was spir- 
ited. Ralph McNellis, the citi- 
ELECTION DAY AT COMO AVENUE PLAYGROUND zens’ candidate for mayor, had 
some cards printed after the 
most approved municipal fashion. The playground shelter house was 
covered with posters. The election was by secret ballot and resulted in 
a victory for Sam Longfellow, the candidate for the playgrounds party. 
The election, however, was the main thing, There never seemed to be 
any time to get the council together, they were all too busy playing. 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
THE EVOLUTION OF ST. PAUL PLAYGROUNDS 105 
We tried to get the Board of Park Commissioners to appropriate a 
small sum of money to the Juvenile City and have the children in return 
take the contract for cutting the 
grass, watering, assisting in clean- 
ing the grounds, ete., which 
seemed to us a very practical way 
of teaching municipal methods of 
handling money and the working 
of city governments. Incidentally 
the care of the grounds could be 
secured more cheaply than in any 
other way and the plan would 
give the juvenile officials some- 
thing to do. However, this plan 
did not appeal to the park board. 
T hope to see this plan worked OFFICERS OF COMO AVENUE PLAYGROUND CITY 
insome city. With nothing to do, 
our juvenile officials pined and died officially. Such a condition does not 
seem so unfavorable to more mature incumbents!

For a description of the activities of this League see Volume II. 
24. From Report or SUPERINTENDENT OF Parks. “The present 
organic act of the playground management is one of the most unsatisfactory 
of any of the departments of the city government. The powers of the play- 
ground committee under the city ordinance confined to an advisory capacity, 
do not serve as a stimulus to enthusiasm in their work. The development 
and care of the playgrounds should be placed in the hands of aggressive 
men and women, especially fitted for and interested in the work, with suffi- 
cient authority to care for, provide, and equip the playgrounds of the city 
outside of public parks.” 
The purchase of a tract of land shown in plan on page 106 and the 
installation thereon of a set of iron pipe swings, see-saws, as per illustration 
on page 98, giant strides with a very small amount of grading completed 
the improvements for the second year. 
25. Ficutine tue Streer Raiwway ro Save rHe PiayGRounp. 
People who know, say that the street railway in St. Paul own the city govern- 
ment. Early in the winter of the second year, the street railway conceived 
the idea of making an extension and laying tracks directly through the 
street which separates the two larger triangles of the Como Avenue play- 
ground. Largely through the efforts of Mr. George F. Fisher, of the play- 
ground committee, who aroused intense opposition to the scheme among 
the property owners in that part of the city, the street car tracks were put 
through on au adjoining street, thus preserving the possibility of improving 
the playground ultimately, according to the plan proposed.

26. Piaycrounn Exrension. Early in the spring of the third year, 
the work of improving the Arlington Hills Playground according to plan 
above was commenced. 
This ground was very rough, having a hole where some street car barns 
formerly stood. The ground is graded level with the exception of the 
baseball diamond, which is lowered two and one-half feet, draining to the 
center where it is connected with the sewer. ‘The banks on the sides make 
possible a skating rink in the winter. Outside the baseball diamond is an 
eighth of a mile running track; then a grassy slope to the upper level. 
The borders around the grounds are a few inches higher than the play 
space and covered with turf. Lilacs are grouped in appropriate places. 
Along the front of the grounds is a buckthorn hedge, while one side has a 
hedge of lilacs. A high wire fence at the top of the bank around the running 
track protects those using the playground apparatus from the batted balls. 
This provision and the fact that the baseball diamond is much lower tha2

the rest of the ground makes baseball in such small quarters possible. Of 
course the ball goes out into the street quite often. 
27. Gymnastic Equipment. The gymnastic equipment installed 
includes 2 giant strides, 1 set of nine iron pipe swings, 1 set 4 see-saws with 
iron pipe frames, 1 iron pipe square gymnasium frame, with ladders, hori- 
zontal bar, climbing poles, climbing ropes, trick rings, ete.

This equipment cost about $500. 
The grading, surfacing, play space and running track with cinders and 
clay and placing concrete under swings and around giant strides cost about 
$2,500. The other landscape gardening outlined will be put in some time. 
Another playground was secured by exchanging seven lots belonging 
to the city, another unused haymarket site, and purchase of the remaining 
lots in the block. This, when improved, will make the largest playground 
in the interior of the city. 
The same plan of athletic work used in previous years was carried out 
early in the winter and a skating rink was made at the Arlington Hills 
playground. 
After I was called to a larger work in Denver, the physical director of 
the Y. M. C. A. was secured to devote half of his time to the supervision 
of the playgrounds. The Park Board has established, under the direction
-P-A-G-E-107
108 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
of its Superiatendent, a large playground in one of the outlying parks, and 
one or two small pieces of land have been purchased to be improved as 
playgrounds. 
28. Minnesota State Law. The State of Minnesota, in 1909, 
passed a new law permitting the cities of Duluth, Minneapolis, and St. 
Paul to issue bonds not to exceed one hundred thousand dollars for the 
purchase and equipment of playgrounds. These bonds are distributed 
through a period of four years, twenty-five thousand being available each 
year. St.Paul has taken advantage of this and will spend twenty-five thou- 
sand immediately for the purchase and improvement of two new play- 
grounds. 
_ The following statement regarding the duties of playground super- 
visors we made in the June number of Hygiene and Physical Education, 
page 341: 
. “In order to successfully carry on the préss work and organization of games, the super- 
visor was obliged to spend most of his time away from the playground, which seems to be tnfortungte as the playground is the proper place for a supervisor to spend most of 
is time. 
Lest the statement should be misunderstood, we would add that the supervisor of 
playgrounds, especially when the movement is young, is primarily an organizer, promoter 
an advertiser. yy the committee says, “Here is so much money; make and run a play- 
oon system.” It would be as reasonable to expect the supervisor of playgrounds to Spend his time on the playground under such circumstances, as to expect a superintendent 
chooks or a SU] Tintendent of parks to spend his time in any one school or par. to 
playground committee or association made up of social workers able and willing 
attend to executive, details, including publicity and outside organization of sports will enable e Sul sor to devote more time to activities on the playground. . The term, Director or Superintendent of Playgrounds, would more accurately indicate 
the place of the head of the playground system. t “| n are not asking for playgrounds,” and the supervisor or someone must go out 
and work up an attendance. “The child who cannot find his own amusement on the street 
isn't worth, saving.” Competition of the street and vacant lot in a medium-sized city makes 
playground operation difficult. 
To create public sentiment playgrounds must be constantly intruded before the eyes 
of th le by th ublic press, at you expect the press itself to do the work you are e people e ic press, ‘0 do the work you | 
seriously shistalen. Phe work devolves on the director. Most boards expect the supervisor 
to attend to all executive details, to keep the playground filled with children, playing under 
his personal supervision, and to find him at any one of the playgrounds at any hour of the 
day. Our advice is to have the expected duties defined and clearly stated in a contract 
to prevent any misunderstanding.

CHAPTER XV 
An Ipeat DEVELOPMENT FOR A PLAYGROUND ON AN IrREGULAR TRacT 
or Lanp Berween Five anp Six Acres In Extenr* 
Lorna Hicper LeLanp 
Playground Architect and Organizer 
The fullest possible utilization of a piece of land for play purposes is 
not in any way inconsistent with its development as a work of outdoor art. 
In preparing this plan the play possibilities have, I think, been developed 
to the fullest extent consistent with the maintaining of landscape beauty. 
1. Grapxs. The lowest grade called for is in the center of the ath- 
letic field, where two catch basins are to be placed for drainage of the left- 
hand half of the entire playground. The running track and 100-yard 
straightaway are cach approximately the same grade, but higher than the 
athletic field, so that they drain into it. In winter time the entire surface 
of the athletic field and running tracks is to be flooded for skating and for 
coasting; the all-seasons coast being conducted down the shoot and 
around the running track, ending over the end of the straightaway running 
track, making a coast of about one-third of a mile. The boys’ playground, 
the borders around the athletic field, and the borders outside the athletic 
field are all higher than these other two grades. 
The little children’s playground and the girls’ playground will be graded 
at still another level. 
The space taken up around the all-seasons coast, winter coast, neigh- 
borhood club house, dancing green, and the right-hand side of the girls’ 
playground is all on the grade given by following the natural slope of the 
land. Considerable of the apparatus in the girls’ playground will be set 
up on a slope, the peculiar construction of this apparatus making this 
possible. 
2. WaxKs anp Tracks. The main entrance to the grounds and 
the plaza in front of the neighborhood club house and on the side should 
be of concrete. The slope of the walk at the right-hand side of the club 
house will give admirable opportunity for roller skating and small wagon 
coasting. In order to economize space, the walk and irregular one-quarter 
mile running track are combined with each other. ‘This and the 100-yard 
straightaway track should be made of a combination of clay and cinders, 
or a combination of clay and certain kinds of sand is sometimes cheaper 
and nearly as efficient.

A PLAYGROUND ON AN IRREGULAR TRACT OF LAND 11 
The runways for jumping, for the baseball diamonds and playing sur- 
faces for boys’, little children’s and girls’ playgrounds can be made of the 
same material, preferably of clay and cinders, and the playground surfaces 
should have a larger proportion of cinders than is used in the runways. 
3. Fencrs. The entire field should be surrounded by a fence, the 
construction of which will depend upon the amount available for this pur- 
pose. An iron picket fence is best, but a very good substitute can be made 
by attaching a strong fine mesh (not more than 24-inch opening horizontally) 
field fencing attached by bolts to second hand 1} or 2-inch iron pipe. This 
should be 5 or 6 feet high. Above this and very close to it should be sus- 
pended three strands of hog style barbed wire fencing. Chapter XVII (5). 
There should be a fence around the boys’ playground and around the 
little children’s and the girls’ playgrounds; and a fence around the running 
track would be very valuable during exhibit games and meets, but could be 
dispensed with, or a temporary fence could be made by setting permanent 
posts through which rope could be run whenever competition games were 
to be held. 
4. Lanpscape Garpeninc. The entire grounds with the exception 
of walks, tracks, boys’, little children’s and girls’ playgrounds, as well as 
the athletic field and tennis courts should be covered with turf. If the 
plavground is not in a very populous district, it may be possible to maintain 
turf on the athletic field and girls’ playground and on part of the little chil- 
dren’s playground. 
The plan calls for the planting of over 100 elms and about 50 Carolina 
poplars together with some other trees and various hardy shrubs which are 
massed in corners. 
The little children’s and girls’ playgrounds should be surrounded with 
a high growing hedge and the boys’ playground should be surrounded with 
athorn hedge. If hedges are too expensive they can be replaced by hardy 
annual climbing vines, which will cover the fences around each enclosure. 
The fence around the entire ground should be covered with hardy vines or 
with annual climbers if the others are too expensive. he little children’s 
playground and the girls’ playground should be separated by a low fence 
covered with sweet peas. The walk should be bridged by an arched trellis 
and vines should be trained to run over this and over the fence concealing 
the disagreeable effect of the sharp corner, where the walk runs near the 
property line. 
5. Puay Faciriries. Mr. Leland has assisted me in developing the 
various pieces of play equipment. Only those pieces of apparatus which 
we have proven by years of observation as play directors, to be most valu- 
able and interesting to the children, are suggested. The opinions and ex- 
perience also of such play authorities as Doctor Curtis, Joseph Lee and
-P-A-G-E-111
112 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
others have been consulted in this study of play equipment. ‘he details 
of construction, and how they can be made economically by home labor or 
local contractors will be dwelt upon later (Chapters NNV. NNVI). 
6. Boys’ Piaycrounp. Combination swings and gymnasium, 
consisting of six 11 foot swings, two pairs trick rings, one trapeze. one in- 
cline steel ladder, one incline steel wire cable ladder, two pairs incline steel 
sliding poles, one slide for life, leading to teeter ladder frame, one horizontal 
bar. 
Teeter ladder frame with four teeter ladders and attachment for slide 
for life. 
Volley ball and basketball courts. 
Tether pole tennis. 
Flying Dutchman. 
Giant Stride. 
The traveling rings are planned to be suspended from wire cables 
stretched from the top of the climbing pole frame to another support on 
which is attached one of the basketball screens. This is a new piece of 
apparatus which has not been tested as yet and if it works successfully, 
it will entirely do away with the necessity’ of using square. iron pipe gym- nasium frames, as traveling rings are the only pieces of apparatus which 
cannot successfully be attached to straight line frames. Straight line frames are more economical of space and money and better adapted to make 
possible artistic landscape effects than square frames.

11. NercHsorHoop Cius Howse. This should include assembly 
hall, club rooms, branch of public library, baths, and small gymnasiums 
for use when it is impossible on account of bad weather to use the outdoor 
play facilities. 
12. Generat Remarks. The intention in this suggestive plan of 
treatment is to make the play facilities out-of-doors so attractive both summer 
and winter that there will be little need of indoor amusements and attrac-
-P-A-G-E-113
114 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
tions. Unless I had at least $50,000 to $75,000 to expend on this ground 
exclusive of club house, I should not include a more elaborate outdoor 
gymnasium equipment. Such equipment as is outlined can be used almost 
to the fullest extent of its possibilities without requiring much of the atten- 
tion of the director, leaving his time free for the formation of athletic fields, 
teaching games, etc., which is much more important than the teaching of 
gymuastic stunts from a social and moral as well as physical standpoint. 
All of these pieces of play equipment, with the exception of all-seasons 
coast, roller coast and slide should be purchasable ready made from the 
machine companies, and set up ready for use for about $1,100 to $1,200. 
‘They can be made by local contractors from proper specifications for 
this sum if not less. Provided such a plan is feasible, wherever there is a 
lack of financial support, frames can be erected by local contractors and the 
apparatus to attach thereon made by manual training students of the public 
schools, working from properly prepared plans, or in case of extreme 
necessity the trades union people may be induced to contribute their ser- 
wees in » Precting the frame, providing merchants’ associations wil! contribute

Lanpscape GARDENING 
1. Tress. 
(a) For quick shade, the Carolina poplar is the best tree. This 
should be planted in alternation with other trees which grow more slowly 
and which live longer, such as elms and oaks. White maples also grow 
very quickly but are not as long lived as oaks and elms. 
We have never known of chestnut being used for playground purposes 
but think it would be admirable, the ripening of the chestnuts would be an 
never ending sort of delight. The chestnut, however, will not grow in soil 
where lime is present. 
In general, trees should be used which have a heavy rough bark, and 
if possible those with low branches should be selected, for sometime, it is to 
be hoped, they will grow so that the boys can build a playhouse in them. 
(6) Trees necessary for shade as well as beauty. 
(c) Should surround also each separate section of the playground. 
(d) In Germany they surround the larger playgrounds with several 
rows of trees, thus making it in effect a glade in a forest. 
2. Grass. 
(a) Grass should be encouraged wherever possible. 
(6) In the larger playgrounds all the chief fields should be covered 
with grass. 
(c) Even in the smallest grounds, there is usually some strip or border 
where grass can be encouraged. 
3. FLowxrs. 
(a) The larger grounds have the same possibilities as the parks, 
though they must be placed so as not to interfere with the activities. 
(6) In smaller grounds, flowers may be put around the flag pole, 
and about the buildings and fences. The children may be encouraged 
to tend them. 
4. VINEs. 
(a) The use of vines will be determined by the nature of the fences 
and buildings. 
(6) A wire fence can be made beautiful with morning-glory, honey- 
suckle, cypress or thumburgia, climbing pea or scarlet runner vines. 
(©) Virginia creeper will cover an ugly board fence so as to make it 
presentable.

(d) Wisteria, Kundz vine and ivy will cover the playground buildings 
if desired. ; 
(e) Morning-glory and Kundz vine will cover the trellises at the toilets 
or the frame over the sand bin. 
5. Seuss. About the best shrub to use on playgrounds is the lilac. 
It is perfectly hardy, will grow almost anywhere, and the more it is picked 
and maltreated the more it spreads and grows. Forsythia is valuable for 
planting along the side of walks. Hawthorn, deutzia, dogwood, bridal 
wreath, roses, sumach, viburnum, syringa, weigelia, snowball, common 
and Japanese, are all suitable for playground use. By having the children 
plant the seeds and grow the shrubs a playground could be made beautiful 
quite easily. We would suggest that the children be encouraged to secure, 
transplant and tame wild shrubs. (See article on “The Play Course in 
Landscape Gardening and Horticulture,” Chapter XA. 
(a) Great possibilities in the use of shrubbery in large grounds. 
(6) Very restricted use in small grounds. 
(c)_ It is very desirable that the girls’ playground especially should be 
screened from public gaze. If there is an iron picket fence, a few feet of 
shrubbery just inside it will serve to make the playground exclusive. 
(d) A border of shrubbery can also often be used effectively imme- 
diately about the building. 
  6. Ruves ror Lanpscape GARDENING. It is impossible to make a 
landscape architect by means of writing upon the subject because it is all 
or largely a matter of composition. Nature is the best teacher. When 
trees, plants, shrubs and flowers are arranged in the way Mother Nature 
does it, the affect cannot help being artistic. Landscape gardening is used 
for the production of beautiful pictures. One has to know what these would 
be. In general the aim should be to conceal all unsightly objects, buildings, 
etc., and to bring into prominence anything of beauty such as a distant 
church spire, a hill or a mountain. It would be well to let the children 
experiment and try to imitate and reproduce beautiful views which they 
may see. This would vive an never ending source of interest for excursions 
into the country. 
7. Tue Use or Warrr. 
{a) There is an abundance of opportunity for water landscape effect 
in the large playgrounds through the use of lagoons and lakes. 
(b) There are usually some possibilities from the wading pool and 
swimming pool in the smaller playground. 
Wherever possible, the landscape value of water should be made use 
of. Water seems to have an effect upon our subconscious mind, which is 
very valuable, especially in the noisy city. It suggests quiet, peace, repose 
and coolness. It is not necessary that there should be an ocean of it either. 
Perhaps the best use for water is in the wading pool. Wherever possible,
-P-A-G-E-116
LANDSCAPE GARDENING 117 
the traditional form of the wading pool should be altered. Many parks 
have streams running through which might be utilized. A pool could 
be made by hollowing out a place in the natural course of the stream and 
covering the bottom with rocks, with about six inches to a foot of sand 
covering them. A background of spruces* would give tone to the picture 
and set off the naturalistic treatment. Rushes, water grasses and wild rice 
could fringe the further bank: between these and the trees quantities of 
cardinal flowers and fringed gentians should be planted. On the near 
side of the wading pool is an appropriate place for a broad sand beach; at 
the small end of the pool may be placed an immense boulder where the 
children may play “Pilgrim Fathers Landing on Plymouth Rock.” ete. 
A retaining wall in the rear may be covered with Boston ivy which grows 
from the grouid below and also which runs down from the street above. 
This is applicable where the brook runs through a culvert under a street. 
Violets and other plants which love to grow beside the brook may be 
transplanted here and taken care of by the children.

8. Waving Poors ror ScHoor Yarns. Mr. Walter Hardy savs in 
ard to wading pools: “No playground is complete unless it affords a

chance for the children to get their feet wet. Twice during the past summer 
we had rains heavy enough to fill a low spot in one corner of our playground 
with water which remained there all day. Nothing pleased the children 
more than to wade in this little pool. Even big girls twelve years old, who 
at first thought themselves ‘too big to go barefooted.’ were soon in with 
the rest. Following the suggestion of this incident and the plan of the pools 
on the South Park playgrounds of Chicago. I believe it would be possible 
at very little expense to have a wading pool on even a school yard play- 
ground. A man with team and scraper could soon lower a basin two feet 
deep and sixteen feet square which, lined with cement and a drain in the 
center, could be filled with fresh water every day.” 
9. Suave. Shade is absolutely essential to the successful conduct 
of a playground. This may often be furnished by means of awnings but 
it is our opinion that landscape gardening and the use of trees and vines 
should be prominent. The sketch on next page shows an easy method 
whereby swings may be shaded. The same principle may be applied to 
other features of apparatus. Mr. Walter E. Hardy, speaking of shade in 
an article in Playgrounds, says in part: 
10. PLayerounp Conprtions Best WHEN Like Coustry. “The 
most ideal conditions for freedom of play are to be found in the country 
where nature offers opportunities that harmonize with boy nature—shade, 
grass on which to roll and tumble, an old ‘swimmin’ hole,’ trees in which 
to climb, and fields where he may run and romp. Then we at once conclude 
that city playgrounds should conform as nearly as possible to natural re- 
quirements. In our congested city population the lack of these natural 
places for play creates the need for artificial playgrounds.” 
M1. Swape Azsovurery Necrssary. “Nearly all of the play 
centers now furnish opportunities for climbing and running, bul the shade, 
grass, and water are lacking. In most places where playgrounds are 
started as experiments by private donation, in order to get them centrally 
located, they are opened up on some sun-baked schoolyard, with possibly 
a few scrawny trees around the outside, no water near, and no grass. 
Apparatus, such as swings, teeters, ladders, etc., and a bare, heat-reflecting 
open space for massed games, are common to all such playgrounds as I 
have seen. Such an equipment would tax the ingenuity of the most re- 
sourceful director to hold the interest of the children during the hottest days 
of summer, when every game that calls for violent exercise in the hot sun 
is sure to result in some child having a headache, nose-bleed or sunstroke. 
“My observations have been that the shaded apparatus is most used 
by the children. Swings hanging in the sun on our playground in Kalama- 
zoo, Michigan, last summer, remained empty, while those in the shade 
were being used. As soon as the afternoon shade from the schoolhouse 
reached the hot, empty teeters they became filled. Sand piles in the open 
sun dry out and are of little use. The largest crowds came to play on cloudy 
and cool days. On those days all of the apparatus was in constant use,

besides the enthusiasm that was shown in the team games, story hours and 
quiet circle games, all of which goes to prove that playgrounds should be 
provided with plenty of shade. If trees are not to be had, tents and canvas 
coverings will serve the purpose, and should be placed over the sand piles 
and apparatus, in part at least. The tents appeal to the child’s imagination 
and may, in consequence, be put to various uses. A piano, if one is provided, 
should be under this shaded area, to be used in many of the games, marches 
and dances.”

CHAPTER XVII 
Fences anD Hepors* 
1. Reasons ror Fencing PLayGrounps: 
{a) Protection of the trees, flowers and shrubbery. 
(6) Keeping out lawless gangs and toughs, and helping in discipline. 
(ec) Protecting the girls and little children from annoyance. 
(d) : The protection of the apparatus and preventing the congregation 
of undesirables on the playgrounds at night. 
  ARTISTIC FENCE POSTS (Chicago small parks) The question is often asked can 
a playground be run without a fence? 
In answer to this, we would say that 
it is not an impossibility. Che play- 
grounds of St. Paul have been run 
without fences for a number of 
years. This is the way we did it. 
All the apparatus was taken in at 
night. ‘wo or three nights a week 
the supervisor had his assistant go 
away and leave him in the build- 
img. where he stayed until children 
and others congregated. When a 
sufficient crowd had assembled the 
supervisor appeared and sent them 
home. After several weeks of this 
the children got the idea that he 
lived in the shanty, so that it was not 
necessary to watch it closely. We 
think it is cheaper to have a fence. 
The supervisor has more important 
business to attend to, and very little 
dependence can be placed upon 
casual visits of the police. We never 
would recommend the establishment 
of an unfenced playground. Aside 
from the maintenance of order 
there is a psychological value to a fence which cannot be over-estimated. 
It transforms the playground from the vacant lot and gives something 
which the children belong to so that the maintenance of discipline is much 
easier.

FENCES AND HEDGES 121 
2. Kinps or Fencina. 
(a) The steel picket is the most common. It is very expensive. 
Chicago playgrounds show best example. 
(b) A wire fence covered with vines is much cheaper and seems to 
serve equally well and need not be a disfigurement to the grounds. It can, 
in fact, be made a decided ornament by covering it with vines. 
(©) Evergreen hedge or privet, reinforced with wire, makes an ex- 
cellent fence. 
8. Tur Gares. 
The gates should be of a kind that cannot be easily climbed over and 
should be closed at a certain hour every night. 
4. Hepaes. 
(a) In general, hedges are very much cheaper, harder to climb and 
are much more beautiful than picket fences, and shut out the gaze of unde- 
sirable spectators. 
(6) They will need to be reinforced by a wire fence at the beginning. 
(c) Some form of evergreen privet seems to serve the purpose best in 
the North. 
(d) Prickly barberries make a good low hedge to protect grass areas 
and keep the children in the path. 
We have always used buckthorn for hedges. This, ' cwever, is quite 
expensive and the buckthorn is rather a difficult shrub ts ,row. Japanese 
barberry makes a very good hedge and is suitable for ser arating the interior 
parts of the playground, but not so good for the outside. 
We have been experimenting with hawthorn wh’c! if it proves suc- 
cessful ought to be the best hedge for New England, where it grows wild. 
The hawthorn will grow on very poor sandy soil. Ve have a hedge set 
out two years ago, taking the plants direct from the woods. We did not 
prepare the soil and watered but once. Only a few died in spite of hot, dry 
summers. 
If any of our readers should desire to plan« a hawthorn hedge we 
should be glad to furnish them with sample plants at cost of collecting them 
from the woods. The hawthorn is about the toughest shrub which grows. 
When the branches are green it is absolutely impossible to break them 
across.

A. PrayGRouNDS aND OPERATION. 
Los Angeles represents the final consummation of the combination of 
the playground and the social settlement. The country at large has much 
to learn from this city. Chicago has developed its wonderful system of 
field houses and recreation parks on a gigantic scale. Los Angeles was the 
first city to adapt these to the conditions which obtain outside the largest 
cities. Through the kindness of Miss Bessie D. Stoddart and Mr. Raitt, 
we are enabled to reproduce specifications and plans of these buildings as 
well as photographs. For other matter regarding supervision of Los Angeles 
playgrounds and the playground commission, see Volume II. 
  FIELD HOUSE AT ECHO PARK PLAYGROUND 
Los Angeles 
One of the most valuable features of the work in Los Angeles is the 
fact that the playground directors live on the grounds. In this connection, 
Miss Stoddart says: 
“We find it most important to have the man in charge of a playground 
resident upon it. This insures perfect care of the apparatus, and abso- 
lutely no interference with grounds when they are closed. F: ‘ar more than 
this, however, is the factor of the resident director being a part of the

neighborhood. He is one with the people. His home becomes a nucleus of 
social life in the community. The playground possesses the craving feature 
of the settlement, the home atmosphere and influence. 
“In the recreation center, we have an artistic little apartment of five 
rooms and bath for the resident manager and his wife. At Echo Park 
Playground. My. Best and his sister, Miss Best, occupy certain rooms in 
the Club House, but a bungalow residence will be erected there the coming

The children and young people have enjoyed to the utmost the games, 
sports, and gymnastic drill, and free play upon swings, see-saws, Maypoles, 
and other apparatus, which these grounds provide. The little folks have 
amused themselves in the sand boxes, playing with the large blocks, while 
the adults have found pleasure in watching all that was going on. Count 
being taken once during the day of those present, 53,948 represents the at- 
tendance for one year. 
Little gardens were cultivated to the number of forty-eight, and the 
children proudly carried home their products of vegetables and flowers. 
A system of daily marking for care and neatness was instituted, and in June 
prizes were awarded to those whose gardens showed the most faithful and 
diligent attention. 
The grounds are open all day during vacations, and on Saturdays and 
holidays, and from two o’clock until dark on school davs. On Sunday

afternoons. though there are no match games or gymnasium work, the 
place becomes a park for the families of the neighborhood. The play- 
ground has been open during the noon hour on school days to accommodate 
the 835 children of the near-by Seventh Street School, where the yards are 
very small. The kindergarten of the school, too, frequently employs a 
morning at the grounds. The 300 girls of the Boyle Heights Orphanage, 
just across the river, at intervals spend a whole day on the playground, 
bringing luncheon with them. 
Interest in girls’ games and athletics was greatly stimulated by the 
creation of the position of assistant, who had charge of girls’ work, dividing 
her time between Playgrounds No. 1 and No. 2. One of the chief features 
at both playgrounds was the organization of basketball teams. And an 
interesting outgrowth of this was instruction in sewing, the girls bringing 
to the grounds material for their suits, and being taught how to make them. 
The care of the little children, the leadership of older girls in their 
games, athletics and gymnasium work, demand that each ground have a 
woman assistant. 
1. Vistrive Nurse’s Hranquarrers. Adjoining the superintend- 
ent’s bungalow is the station of one of the city visiting nurses, working under 
the auspices of the College Settlement, and in close connection with the 
City Health Department. ” Besides the district work, this nurse has charge 
of the school nurse work of the Seventh Street School. 
2. Ciup House. The building for indoor recreation was finished 
this year. It is an artistic bungalow, the main room of which is about 
25 x 36 feet, with one end elevated as a stage. A large open fireplace, many 
windows and electric lights, together with chairs and tables for grown 
people and children, make this a pleasant place for meeting. A small club 
room, a dressing-room, a kitchen and a storeroom complete the house. 
3. Priaycrounp Lisrary. The work which the Public Library 
began in the summer of 1906, continued out-of-doors two afternoons a 
week throughout the winter, but when the Club House was opened it found 
accommodation there. 
We have 183 books from the city library, and about 800 discards. 
The city books are circulated only among those having regular city cards. 
For the discards we issue a playground library card. We have issued 551 
of these cards. 
4. Tue Svory Hour. The story hour has been from the first a 
source of great interest, and has created a demand for books which other- 
wise would not have been read. But during the past few months the time 
has been so taken up at the desk that the stories have been almost entirely 
discontinued. 
5. Giris’ Cius. The girl’s serap-book club has been cutting and 
pasting magazine pictures into books made by themselves. They have 
made twenty-five.

It has been the aim to teach respect for books and the proper care of 
them, to uphold the dignity of the library, and to inculcate feelings of civic 
pride and responsibility in all who come in contact with the library. 
6. Boys’ Crus. Miss Belle Parsons has been very successfully 
directing a club of boys from eight to thirteen years of age called “King 
Arthur’s Knights,’ organized for the study of Knights and Chivalry. 
There are thirty-four members. They have regular readings from the best 
books on the subject, and from the study of legends and pictures have made 
arms and armor and spend a part of each meeting in outdoor practice of 
knightly games. A grand tournament will be given in December, after 
which the club will take up the reading of Greek hero tales and their 
dramatization. 
B. Cr.esrations DurING THE YEAR 
1. Curisrmas. On December 29th, Christ Church Sunday school 
entertained about 500 children at the playground. A beautiful Christmas 
tree was placed outdoors, around which the children’s choir sang carols. 
Mr. Baker P. Lee gave an interesting talk to the young people, after which 
gifts and candy were distributed. The candy was kindly furnished by 
Bishop & Company, and Kahn-Beck Company, while Hamburger & Sons 
provided a share of the toys. 
2. Crrcus Day. . On April 10th the Los Angeles Examiner gave a 
children’s day at Sells-Floto Circus. About 300 children and 50 adults 
from the playground neighborhood enjoyed this treat. Mr. Howard E.

corps. It is planned to have dramatics on all the grounds. Walks into the 
country and camps are also planned for this season. 
The playground is a branch of the public library. It is possible to carry 
on such a work through the assistance of voluntary helpers who aid the 
paid workers. 
C. Los Angers BuILpInes 
The Chicago buildings are described in Chapter X; more applicable 
to the small city is the Los Angeles style of building which we are able to 
show in detail together with plans and specifications. Miss Stoddart 
says: 
1. Crus House. “The contract of our latest club house at Slauson 
Avenue Playground has just been let for $8,885. This will be located 
in a four and one-half acre playground, which will have an equipment of 
an outdoor gymnasium, ball field, handball, basketball, croquet, play 
apparatus, gardens, wading pool, and in time a bungalow residence for 
the director. Planting will surround the building. A feature which we 
think will prove a great saving in time and exertion is the device for storing 
the chairs under the stage, when the hall needs to be cleared (which will 
be the greater part of the time). The steps up to the stage hinge back and 
trucks under the stage can be pulled out, the folding chairs laid flat on them 
and the trucks be pushed back out of the way. So the transformation from 
a lecture hall to drill or club room can be made very quickly. The new 
club house will have plaster and half timber exterior, as is the case with the 
club house at Playground No. 2; the club rooms and kitchen will be used 
for residence of director until his bungalow residence shall be built, as we 
firmly believe in having the director a resident. 
2. Recreation Center. “The cost of the building was less than 
$21,000. It was built in the hard times when materials and labor were low 
and is really about a $30,000 building. The extra cost of apparatus, running 
track, bowling alley, lockers, furniture, $5,600 extra. On the drawings no 
note is made of mezzanine rooms over the kitchen and library; one is the 
physical instructor’s room for measurements, private shower, etc., the 
other, a small club room. 
“Alterations suggested by experience: I would say that the stage 
should be wider, and library room and club room in mezzanine larger. 
We changed the plans as follows: Main entrance basement floor we made 
one large lobby with stairs ascending (instead of club room and hall as indi- 
cated on the plan). Where these stairs lead to the gymnasium, we left out 
toilet and made wide double doors into gymnasium; also cut doors for 
outside and ran iron stairway down to the ground. Until other parts of the

THE PHILOSOPHY OF CONSTRUCTIVE PLAY
-P-A-G-E-159
CHAPTER XIX 
Tue Puace or Constructive Pray is THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
InpIvIDUAL AND THE Race as ConTRASTED WITH 
ATHLETIC AND Socrat Play 
By Artuur Letanp, B.P.E. 
A. Vauue or Two Types or Pray 
1. Aruetic anp Socrat Pray. Athletic and social plays have to 
do largely with the relation of man to his fellows, and conditions of hygiene. 
We do not think that their importance has been over-estimated, but we 
think that the place which constructive play holds has been under-esti- 
mated. Under the term constructive play we have arbitrarily included the 
relations of child to nature, and to inanimate objects and animals other than 
the human kind. 
2. Constructive Tram Pay. We see no reason why constructive 
play should not contribute as much to the loyalty of the individual to the 
crowd, to the gang, and to the nation as has been claimed for team games. 
Team play in construction strikes us as being infinitely more valuable 
than team play in war; the citizen who saves lives for his country is a greater 
patriot than the one who destroys. 
38. INTELLIGENCE Drvetorep TurovcH Weakness. Biologists 
say that man’s intellect has been created by his hands, and that the training 
of the hand has been due to necessity. It is well stated that necessity is the mother of invention. Ages and ages ago there was an insignificant 
animal, helpless, unprotected. It had no shell like the turtle or clam; it 
had no claws like the cat or tiger; it had no horns like the cow; it could not 
run like the horse; so being made unable to protect itself by any of these 
means it did just what we would do under similar circumstances, when 
pursued it took to the trees. After living in trees for awhile it found that 
by taking a stick it could knock over a few weak things, like rabbits or birds. 
Some time seeing a cocoanut drop down it imitated the force of Nature, 
then it learned to throw rocks, finally to use stones for digging the soil. 
It is doubtful if any of these lessons were ever learned without a life and 
death struggle. 
The human race is what it is today on account of weakness. The clam 
and the turtle got inside their shells and there they are today. The cat 
could get its living easily and protect itself from enemies with its sharp 
160
-P-A-G-E-160
CONSTRUCTIVE PLAY IN INDIVIDUAL AND RACE DEVELOPMENT 161 
  “LET THE CHILDREN HELP PUT UP SWINGS” 
Reward the helpers with first swing 
claws and it has never advanced. The horse and the cow had an easy 
time and they are working for us now. Through necessity, experiment, 
and invention, the human race has advanced. 
The systems or persons who deny to the child the chance and method 
of doing for himself what the race has done for itself is robbing him of his 
birthright. 
Education at the call of necessity alone, however, is too expensive. 
Nature shows this to us when she gives us the receptiveness of childhood, 
but to produce the best results in play education Nature’s methods of 
necessity must in a large measure be followed. Safe ideals may be in- 
stilled through play, and the child should be supplied with safe opportuni- 
ties for self education. 
4. Srones ror Breap. When we give the child ready-made things, 
ready-made toys, ready-made playground apparatus, ready-made play- 
grounds, which he could make himself and in so doing receive valuable 
training we give him stones instead of bread. The instinct to play with
-P-A-G-E-161
162 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
things was given the child to stimulate him to make the things he plays 
with. When these things are supplied to him without effort his play comes 
too easy, and becomes a demoralizing influence. 
5. CHILDREN SHouLp Maker Tuer Own Toys. It is probably 
much cheaper and easier to furnish the child with ready-made playthings, 
but they do not have the educational value which would obtain if the child 
were given material for making his playthings with either instruction in the 
methods, or opportunities whereby he could learn to make his own play 
materials.. Toys have a place we suppose, as they have always been used, 
but they should serve as models for imitation and inspiration rather than 
as “sops” with which to satisfy the play instinct. 
6. Consrructive PLay 1s Epucation. With regard to the educa- 
tional value of constructive play, Mr. Harry Leland, Supervisor of Manual 
Training at Leominster, Mass., says: 
“The gigantic strides that normal training and industrial education 
have made during the past five years, only show the high value that con- 
structive work and play fills in our national educational system. The idea 
of creative and constructive play permeates all our elementary and juvenile 
educational work, and the actual ‘ doing of things,’ is rapidly spreading 
through our national life. 
“ Athletic and social plays have a definite and recognized value, but if 
we as a nation wish to compete in the markets of the world we must teach 
our children to recognize the pleasure and value in honest constructive work 
and play. It we really enjoy what we are doing and if it has a recognized 
value for good it matters but little whether we call it work or play. The 
constructive work and play now being offered to the children (and grown- 
ups) of this country will in time put this nation at the front for its manufac- 
tured products; it will develop a higher moral and social character in those 
brought in contact with it; it will increase the efficiency, earning capacity, 
social standing, and self-respect of the worker.” 
Nations cannot spend all their time fighting or governing. Neither 
should children spend all their time playing games which develop only the 
qualities used in fighting and governing. Not that we would have these 
qualities under-developed but that we would have the other qualities de- 
veloped more. “Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall inherit the 
earth.” 
The aristocratic business of England is politics and ruling subject 
races. Their system of athletics and games seems to give the best training 
for this. The brains of America are engaged in business, building rail- 
roads, inventing machines, etc., advancing the arts of peace. 
England seems to be losing her place somewhat in the markets of the 
nations. Germany and America are both crowding English goods out.

164 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
A system of education therefore for America must be based upon the 
education of constructive ability. We must have team play in manufactur- 
ing and the beginnings of this must be made in childhood. Making things 
for the playground and working together in gangs for the playground with 
one of the playground children elected as leader will bring about this codper- 
ation in work quicker than any other method. The foundation for all 
mechanical genius is laid in childhood through constructive play. Our 
greatest men have been interested in nature, horses, animals, and things 
mechanical as much as in athletics and games. 
B. FRanK.iin an EXaMPLe or PLay Epucation 
Perhaps the man who has had the greatest influence upon American 
life is Franklin. His name was more familiar to Europeans and in his own 
country as familiar as Washington’s. *Francis Newton Thorpe says, “He 
became a wise man by teaching himself. His records of the process of his self-culture remain the maxims of a world experience. . . . His unselfish- 
ness was of a kind that we see in trees and plants, which fruit in due 
season with no thought of making the human race their debtors. ... ._ He 
tells us that “he was born and bred in poverty and obscurity, from which 
he emerged to a state of affluence and some degree of reputation in the 
world, and that he went through life in a considerable share of felicity.’ 
He was not sent to college, because his father considered a college 
education too expensive; ‘the mean living many so educated were after- 
wards able to obtain’ was a sufficient reason to the elder Franklin that 
worldly success was not surely to be won after so great an expense. 
1. Franxuin’s Cutpnoop Training. “Franklin, speaking of his 
father’s method of training said that his father at his table liked to have 
as often as he could, some sensible friend or neighbor to converse with, 
and always took care to start some ingenious or useful topic for discourse, 
which might tend to improve the minds of his children. By this means he 
turned their attention to what was good, just and prudent in the conduct of 
life. This insight into his childhood shows how early in life his mind was 
impressed with the paramount importance of things ingenious or useful, 
and to the end, he judged of the value of men’s labor by their usefulness to 
mankind. 
“When it was to be decided to what employment he should be put, his 
father sought a practical solution of the problem by taking him to walk 
with him ‘to see joiners, brick-layers, turners, braziers, etc., at their work, 
that he might observe my inclination and endeavor to fix it upon some trade 
or profession that would keep me on land. It has ever since been a pleasure 
to me to see good workmen handle their tools, and it has often been useful 
to me to have learnt so much by it, as to be able to do some trifling jobs in 
*Report of Commissioner of Education, 1903, page 91.

the house, when a workman could not readily be got, and to construct little 
machines for my experiments while the intention of making the experi- 
ment was still warm in my mind.’ 
2, Practice Not Tureory. “He was himself a close observer, and 
like all great men who have advanced science, he made his observations 
with the assistance of simple and inexpensive instruments. . . . He knew 
nothing of elaborate physical apparatus; Nature was his laboratory, obser- 
vation and experience his teachers, and he relied upon these as the best 
means for the education of others. Ambition stimulated him to gain knowl- 
edge and he reasoned that it would stimulate others. ... He saw in 
industry and business the chief oc- 
cupation of the mass of the people. 
Schools, he thought, should contribute 
to the advantage of this industry and 
this business. He would make tran- 
sition from school life to the life of 
business easy and natural.” 
“*Tt was Franklin,’ says one of 
his biographers, ‘who chiefly educated 
the colonists in a knowledge of their 
rights.’ ”” 
3. Tue PLayScuoor. The play 
school as developed by Dr. Johnson at 
Andover, the vacation school and play- 
ground, and the kindergarten have been 
the most active factors in influencing 
present educational ideals towards 
those which Franklin held. The vaca- 
tion schools and playgrounds in charge 
of the Massachusetts Civic League 
used to take the boys around to visit 
various city industries. 
  CARPENTRY AT SOCIAL CENTER 
4. Tur Aim or THE Puay- Philadelphia 
Grounp. When the work of mankind 
leaves the home because it can be done more economically in the work- 
shop, the necessity of special play education and specific instruction is 
ushered in. 
Denied the privilege of observing adults at their best, in constructive 
effort under discipline, the child must base his play upon the object les-
-P-A-G-E-165
166 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
sons furnished “gratis” by Life’s Loafers and Vampires and the doings 
of adults during their periods of relaxation when restraints are thrown 
aside. 
The playground aims to counteract these evil influences already hard 
at work, and to provide for both child and adult an antidote to the disin- 
tegrating, diseducational and demoralizing effect of necessary specializa- 
tion. Hence the need of public moral cleanliness and provisions for moral 
object lessons actively applied to fill up these “youthful knowledge seek- 
ers,” so that the lessons of the stables, the alley, the gutter, the saloon 
and brothel will find no place empty waiting to be filled. Play seems the 
best method of applying some of these precepts.

This should include sewing, raffia, crocheting and basketry. The 
different stitches in sewing and crocheting and the different forms of weay- 
ing in basketry and raffia should be shown with the materials and practiced 
and learned by the students. Rope splicing, carpentry, whittling and kite 
making are sometimes pursued by the boys. 
1, The children should do as much of the practical work as possible. 
If the boys help to clear the ground and make the ball diamonds and running 
tracks, and the girls make the baby hammocks, and bases for baseball, 
covers for tether balls, bean bags and their own aprons and bloomers, 
the work will be interesting in itself, and will increase their lovalty to the 
playground. 
2. Basket work, raffia and worsteds. Older girls are very fond of

Nore.—The better pieces of work find a ready sale, and in some cities 
there is a practice of having a fair at the end of the season and disposing of 
the objects made. The proceeds go either to the children, to the play- 
ground, or are divided between them. 
The consensus of opinion at the Conference of Kindergartners at the 
Second Playground Congress was: “The materials used by the younger chil- 
dren should be those which lead to the larger activities, such as: standard 
materials—blocks, light boards, sand, clay, shells; natural materials, ms 
cellaneous constructive materials—boxes, spools, twigs, wood, cardboard, 
heavy paper, and such necessary tools as scissors, hammers, glue, nails, ete; 
toys—balls (large and small), pails, shovels, wagons, wheelbarrows, anl- 
mals, dolls, dishes, ropes, brooms.”

B. Constructive PLay Activities OF CHILDREN OF DirrERENt Ages 
By Harry W. Leann, Bs., 
Supervisor of Manual Training, Leominster, Mass. 
Eight to eleven years—Wooden swords, knives, daggers, windmills, 
water wheels, wind vanes, boats, tov furniture. kites, tepees and wigwams. 
Eleven to fourteen years—animal houses and cages, stilts, see-saws, 
skees, toboggans, sleds and guns. 
Fourteen years or older—gymnastic apparatus. furniture, simple 
house or camp construction. 
Construction work suitable for children is given in “ American Boy 
Hand Book,” Dan Beard; “Manual Training Magazine” “School Aris 
Book;” “ Woodworking for Beginners,” by C. G. Wheeler. 
For others see Bibliography and Dr. Johnson's list in “ Education by 
Plays and Games.” 
c. *ATHLETICS AND Manuat TRatNinc CorreLatTeD 
Physical training and manual training may be correlated through con- 
structive play. Children should work for their play. The “ Official” bats, 
balls and other equipment used for school and playground games should be 
“child made;” the champions, those who make the best goods and play the 
best game. Playground and school sports can direct the dynamic stream 0 
play into the channels of “playcraft” where its force can be accustomed to 
industrial uses. If money is spent on materials and instructors to teach the 
children to make their own play supplies, some temptations would be re 
moved from politicians and others who are not in business for their health: 
and athletic sports would be greatly benefited. Interest in games would lead to interest in constructive play and vice versa. In Louisville, whittling 
classes led boys to take an interest in athletic games who could not have been reached otherwise.

. The success of a playground movement depends upon the closeness 
of its relations with the whole community. Benjamin Franklin used to sa 
that the best way to make a friend was to get him to do something for 
you. One of the cardinal principles which is taught to Y. M. C. A. work- 
ers is that they should never do anything themselves which they ©* 
get one of their members to do because if the member works for the ass 
ciation his interest will be kept. The playground movements which are 
successful are those which have the most people working for them. No 
one is so ignorant or so downtrodden but what they can be elevated by 
doing something for someone else. 
*This subject will be elaborated in Volume I:.
-P-A-G-E-170
PLAYGROUND MANUAL TRAINING 171 
We would suggest the formation in each playground of a Playcraft 
League; the object of this league to be to work for the playground, in 
some constructive way. In olden times there were husking bees, house 
raisings, quilting bees, etc. By codperation good fellowship was secured. 
The German turners work together for their turnverein in this way- 
Perhaps this fact may account in part for strength of the movement. 
The citizens of the town of Northboro, Mass., have instituted an annual 
field day. 
A park was donated to the town sometime ago and being unable to secure sufficient 
funds from the town to develop the park the annual field day was instituted. When it 
arrives so do a goodly number of citizens, with their picks and shovels and other implements, 
and for a day they labor with a will toward the further development of the park, in the 
center of which is considerable of an elevation that has been dignified by the name of 
“Mount Assabet.’? There has been much good work done by the citizens, and annually there is made considerable improvement. At noon there is always served a field dinner, 
and the affair has about it some picnic features, which lighten the labors and give some- 
what of a holiday aspect to the situation. The work is done under the direction of the 
park commissioners.—Boston Globe. 
We think this would be an admirable way to make a playground. 
Let the children make the apparatus and then have the fathers and big 
brothers come to put it up and the mothers can come and furnish the 
luncheon. Membership in the Playcraft League could depend upon doing 
something for the playground. 
The playgrounds in Omaha were equipped by the tra 
who did all the work. The merchants donated the materials. This could 
be done anywhere, and it would be a good basis for the beginning of a strong 
playground movement. . 
___ Another way in which this league might be valuable could be in direct- 
Ing the interests of the boys towards various trades. 
Now, if the playground could offer opportunities for the boys to “mon- 
key” around with tools and if the different trades union people could come 
in once in awhile and show the boys how to use these tools it ought to be a 
liberal education. The courses in manual training given in the schools 
tend to specialization. 
Through the play interest of the boy or the girl, the fundamentals of 
handling tools can be learned so as to give a basis for intelligent specializa- 
tion later. 
Whatever mechanical ability the editor possesses was acquired in the 
following manner:—endowed by nature with very strong play instincts 
and not endowed with parents who were in the habit of satisfying these 
play instincts in the ready-made ordinary fashion, by furnishing toys and 
supplies, it became necessary to make the means for enjoying play. There 
is probably not a manufacturing institution in our native town which we 
have not visited for the purpose of gaining information. ‘The foundry was 
visited, the work in all departments copied. This was for the purpose 
of making a casting for the head of a camera tripod. A purchased one des unions
-P-A-G-E-171
172 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
was seen as a model and then a fittle wooden pattern was whittled out, 
sand begged from the foundry, miniature molding tools improvised out of 
pieces of brass and the casting made of lead. Our remembrance is that it 
didn’t work very well, but we learned foundry practice. Now, if money 
had been available, we should have purchased that tripod. 1f we wanted 
to play baseball, we had to make a ball. We wanted a horizontal bar, and 
cut a stick in the woods, which we nailed up between the woodshed and 
the hen house. 
Some such method as this used in the operation and construction of 
playgrounds, we should think would be valuable as a means of education. 
Most boys do not often have workshops with all the necessary tools; again, 
there are “no admittance” signs on all places where interesting industries 
are carried on. The playground should provide the means of natural 
education, which were open to the boys who are now men. It should not 
satisfy all the children’s play instincts without effort on their part. Each 
child should have a trade mark to put on things he makes. The worker 
and craftsman should receive the reward of accomplishment. 
A play work shop would serve as a center of constructive play in the 
neighborhood and furnish the opportunity for artistic workmen to exhibit 
their skill and offer a chance for children to watch their elders at work. 
Ideals of industry would thus be cultivated and opportunity would be given for the children to acquire education through imitation.

CHAPTER XXI 
Domestic ScrENcE 
1. HovsEKrerinc anp Cooxinc. The Dewitt Clinton Park Play- 
ground in New York has a department which we think is valuable enough 
to be copied by other cities. There is on this playground a small house 
with conveniences for housekeeping, and the children are taught elementary 
domestic science. Los Angeles has demonstrated the value of having the 
play director live on the ground, as his house becomes the center of social 
activity to the neighborhood. If on every playground there could be a play 
home where the children could learn some of the lessons which they will 
be calied upon to practice when men and women, the influence of the 
playground would be greatly increased. There is much ignorance of the 
most common details of cooking and home management. Such a course 
should not teach the children to make “peanut cookies,” “Charlotte 
Russe” or “angel food;” but it should teach the elements: how to make 
bread, how to cook beefsteak without making it into leather, how to operate 
and manage a fire economically, how to purchase food supplies, and other 
fundamentals of domestic economy by play methods. 
2. Domxsric Economy. The average wage of the employees in 
the various industries of Massachusetts varies from $425 to $450 per year. 
The problem which most of our playground girls will meet is that of sup- 
porting a family on this income or less. If any assistance can be given 
through play we may rest assured that it is badly needed. . 
It might be arranged so that different girls could each be appointed 
housekeeper for a certain length of time. Certain members of the play- 
ground of various ages might be selected as the family. We might have 
“the baby,” “little Johnny” and “dittle Mary” play keeping house. A 
certain amount of money each week might be apportioned and the girls 
trained in the best way to get the most out of it. 
3. A Worxmay’s Mover Home. The World’s Work for May 
desc-ibes a safe and sanitary home for $1,000. Such a house as this would 
not be beyond the means of most playground systems. It could be made 
an object lesson in the community. 
It is built on the plan which was awarded the gold medal by the Inter- 
national Tuberculosis Congress. Preparations are being made in twenty 
cities for building these houses. 
The floors of the model house are of soft waterproof material, slightly 
sloping to one side with a pipe for drainage. There is not a square corner 
in the house where walls and floors intersect. The connections are rounded 
and afford no lurking place for dust or germs. 
173
-P-A-G-E-173
174 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
Windows and door frames and picture mouldings will be of metal 
and set flush with the walls. No paper on the walls: and furniture can be 
taken out and the inside of the house cleaned with a hose. 
A substantial sink is built in the kitchen with water tight partitions 
so that it can be divided into two tubs or left single for a bath tub, A 
small sheet iron sink for dish washing can be attached. ‘The combination 
gas gauge, stove and furnace is built in the house. It is protected on the 
outside by a cement jacket which prevents its overheating the kitchen. Its 
second purpose is to heat the rest of the house. Between the stove proper 
and the cement jacket are air chambers from which hot air is sent into 
other rooms. ‘The ashes from the stove drop automatically into a pan which 
may be reached by the garbage man from the outside. (Gas may be used 
instead of coal. 
The ice chest also is built into the house with opening in the back 
part to put ice in. In winter the outside door is opened and makes it into 
acold storage. It may be washed with a hose. 
‘The garbage can be kept in a chamber in the wall and may be reached 
from the outside or inside. 
There are fireplaces throughout the house. 
_ The arrangement is such that the smoke passes up a central pipe 
which is enclosed in an air chamber. The air in this latter becomes heated 
from contact with the hot pipe and rises, thus drawing the bad air from the 
room. The coal for all the fires is hoisted to the roof by a simple chain 
block and dumped through a coal hole into a large pocket from which it 
distributes itself automatically, and the housewife feeds the fire by pulling 
a lever. 
When the molds are made, all these conveniences can be had for 
$1,000. 
The Standard Oil Company is going to use this style of house in its 
model town, Bayonne, N. J. 
Tf a home like this could be made on the playground, it would not be 
long before other and similar homes would be made in the vicinity. With 
such conveniences as these, housework could be done in half the time and 
with half the energy now required, leaving time for play. 
4. Pray Hyerene. In connection with the course in domestic 
science many of the elements of hygiene as related to the family could be 
taught, such as treatment for various forms of filth, diseases and parasites 
to which children are subject. First aid to the injured, dental hygiene, 
hygienic cooking, the care of the sick, the care of babies, the rudiments of 
simple dressmaking and housekeeping should all be taken up from the 
play standpoint. It would be an easy matter to secure volunteer workers 
who would take charge of these activities. Another subject, which we 
think comes well within the domain of the domestic science course on play
-P-A-G-E-174
DOMESTIC SCIENCE 175 
hygiene is the formation of proper ideals of marriage. Sex instruction 
should never be given en masse, but to individuals, usually the leaders. 
It requires very careful handling. 
5. Domestic ScjeNcE IN THE Country Scoot. One of the greatest 
causes of ill health among children in the country is the practice of bolting 
a hasty breakfast and running on the way to school immediately afterwards. 
The schools are usually in the center of the village, so that the children 
are obliged to leave early in order not to be late. After having bolted a 
hasty breakfast, at dinner time they eat a very meager and inadequate cold 
lunch, or sometimes they don’t have the appetite to eat anything, and then 
go oul on the playground. This practice is ruinous to health. Some of 
the small towns of Massachusetts have adopted a method which seems to 
work to perfection. The girls prepare the dinners every noon, each taking 
turn as housekeeper. The boys raise some of the vegetables used in the 
school gardens. The effect of this upon the children’s health is immediately 
apparent. ‘Through codperation the expense of feeding all these children 
cannot be much greater when good warm dinners are furnisked than it 
would be for each parent to put up a meager cold lunch, the only parts of 
3 which the children will eat are the cake “ and fixin’s.

CHAPTER XNII 
Piaycrounp Excursions anp Camps 
A. Excursions 
Rochester, in 1903, conducted seven excursions from the congested 
parts of the city to the parks. Their playground system originated this way. 
The Chicago Playground Association is carrying on some interesting 
work in getting large groups to go for walking trips in the country. A leader 
is appointed to take charge of the party which goes by train to one of the 
suburbs, and from there walk for three or four miles in the open country. 
The following general directions are sent to those joining the parties: 
“When taking the train in Chicago do not buy tickets. The leaders 
of the party will be at the gate leading to the train and will give you 4 
numbered coupon, half of which is to be surrendered to the train conductor. 
On the train or during a halt in the course of the walk the leaders will collect 
from each one in the party the amount indicated in this bulletin, which 
includes the cost of a round-trip ticket at commutation rates. plus @ small 
fee to cover the cost of printing and postage. A coupon good for the return 
trip will then be given you. Please provide vourself with exact change 
before starting. , 
“Persons joining the party at an intermediate station will be givem 
coupons after they have boarded the train. 
“Permission has been secured to lead these parties on cross-counby 
tramps through woods and fields. ‘This courtesy on the part of the property 
owners should be met with equal courtesy by the trampers. . 
“In large parties especial care should be exercised to avoid doing 
damage to fences and cultivated fields. Flowers should not be gathered, 
nor limbs of trees or shrubs broken. Gates should be closed by the last 
member of the party. 
“Anyone who may have good photographs taken on any of the walks 
will please communicate with the secretaries.” 
Buffalo also conducts playground excursions. 
B. Potsonous Pianis 
One of the chief dangers in taking city children into the country is 
that of poisonous plants. Children should be taught never to put any 
branches or leaves in their mouths which they do not know are absolutely 
harmless. No berries should be eaten except such as they know are per- 
fectly harmless. 
176
-P-A-G-E-176
PLAYGROUND EXCURSIONS AND CAMPS 177 
These things children of the country usually learn by tradition rather 
than by bitter experience. 
The most dangerous of all poisonous plants are poison oak, poison ivy 
and poison sumach. (Mr. V. kK. Chestnut of the Department of Agriculture 
has prepared a book entitled “Thirty Poisonous Plants,” which may be 
secured from the Government Printing Office and the Secretary of Agri- 
culture.) 
C. Camps 
1. Varue or Praycrounp Camps. The best way to get acquainted 
with people and to find out just what they are and also to influence them 
for good is to go camping with them. ‘The first playground camp which 
we know of was Camp Hubbard which was conducted by the Committee 
on Camps of the Massachusetts Civic League in 1900. The leaders among 
the boys on the playground were taken camping for a week. Other play- 
grounds have introduced camps and there have been a number of municipal 
camps, Newark, New Jersey, conducting such a one. It is our opinion 
that one of the solutions of the city and country problem lies in the estab- 
lishment of camps. 
  A HOME-MADE TENT 
2. Home-Mape Tent. One of the great drawbacks is generally 
that of expense. We cannot see why camps would need to be quite so expen- 
Sive. When we were “kids” we wished to go camping “the worst way.”
-P-A-G-E-177
178 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
Our father didn’t have the money to get us a “fitout.” We designed the 
following method at the age of fifteen: 
The frame work to a tent was made by setting six upright saplings 
about the size of fishpoles so that the two in the middle would serve as an 
attachment for a ridge pole, while the two at each side of this would serve 
as the eaves to a tent frame. The tent was made of unbleached cotton 
cloth cut into the proper sizes so that the piece going over the ridge pole 
would make three sheets if cut up. The two ends of the tent were each the 
proper size to make one sheet. The piece over the top was run over the 
frames and tacked at the bottom. Then the end pieces were pinned to the 
roof and sides. One end piece was split so as to leave an opening by which 
to enter the tent. The fly was made out of another piece of cloth. Then 
above the ridge pole was placed another ridge pole made in the same way 
and over this was stretched a piece of sheeting large enough for two sheets 
with straps sewed on to the ends in which ropes were tied and attached 
to stakes driven in the ground. The only cost was for the unbleached 
cotton sheeting and after the season was over the sheets were thoroughly 
bleached and were made up and used for bed purposes. Total cost of tent 
nothing and bleached sheeting as an added asset. Our paternal ancestor 
saw the point and for three summers two of us went camping on various 
lakes, twenty miles or so from bome. We were each given $1.00 apiece 
per week to pay expenses with and we managed to make it get us there and 
back and pay expenses. (See illustration on page 177.) 
We got jobs haying, picking blueberries, and in some instances caught 
fish and sold them. 
We see no reason why such a plan should not be carried on in larger 
proportions. The trouble with children now-a-days is that they have things too much predigested, ready-made, cut and dried for them. A little 
“roughing it” under proper supervision would do a wonderful amount of 
good to the majority of our city “kids.” Get them out in the country, give 
them two or three dollars a week or have their parents furnish it and let 
them try life, on their own hook. 
8. Fansiy Camp. The city of Berlin has a novel method of getting 
the people out into the country during the summer time. They establish a 
camp on the outskirts of the city, where the people come from the tenements 
and live during the summer time. As a modification of this plan we would 
suggest that every city playground system have established in one of the 
large parks a playground camp, where leaders from the various playgrounds 
of the city could be taken for a week’s outing. It would not be necessary 
that this be put in a public park. It might be carried on in connection with 
the course in gardening.

Companion May 20th, 1909, describes a unique method of making a 
water camp which might be used by the playground boys in one of the city 
parks. Under proper supervision and with proper sanitary regulations a 
fleet of these home-made camps could add much to the play life of the city 
child. We reproduce the cut by permission and refer the reader for de-

DepPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 
By S. C. Corsetr 
“Agriculture in its broadest sense is the primary basis of wealth in 
this country, and it seems essential that efforts should be made in our 
educational system to bring early to the mind of the child facts which will 
be of value as emphasizing the importance and necessity of agricultural 
work. There is no better way to do this than through a well-managed and 
well-conducted system of school garden training. Aside from the fact that 
the interest of the child is early awakened in an industry which means much 
to the future prosperity of this country, there is often a broader application 
of the work in its moral effect on the child. Then, the work is valuable in 
broadening lines of thought, enlarging the scope of the child’s observation, 
and improving its physique. It has been well said that:— 
“*Tn the school garden the fact should always be kept prominent that 
the pupil is to be the most active factor. We can put things in his way to 
help him develop properly and keep him from some of the things that fail 
so to help him, but we cannot do this developing for him, and if he is to 
have a knowledge of the elementary principles of life, of industry, of man- 
kind, of beauty and the morality of work he must work out his own salvation. 
“In the spring of 1902 the Bureau of Plant Industry of the United 
States Department of Agriculture received a request from Normal School 
No. 1 of Washington, D. C., for assistance and codperation in its efforts to 
introduce gardening into the course of the school. 
“The course prescribed in the schoo] at the present time is sufficiently 
elementary to be easily adapted to the schools into which the graduates are 
sent. No text-book is required, books being used simply for reference. 
“Simple experiments are performed and conclusions drawn from the 
results. Soils brought from school grounds are treated with different 
fertilizers, seeds planted in them, and the results carefully noted. The 
water-holding power of soils, the conservation of water by soil mulching, 
the essentials for germination, and the proper depths for planting various 
seeds are learned through experiments. 
“Before the frost touches geraniums, coleus, scarlet sage, and helio- 
trope in the park beds, cuttings are made and placed in clean sand to root, 
thus furnishing material for school-ground decoration later. These slips 
are potted and shifted into larger pots, as required, during the winter, so

that by spring the greenhouse is filled with material for distribution. In 
the spring of 1904, 4,000 plants were sent out from this house, which covers 
an area of only 9 by 32 feet. 
“Besides the herbaceous material mentioned, hard-wood, permanent 
material is used for cuttings. Eight-inch cuttings of privet and forsythia 
are kept during the winter under an open shed in flats filled with sand. 
In March these are sent to schools, with directions for planting. The 
grounds of three schools are now surrounded by thriving hedges planted 
by children. The demand for these cuttings is greater than the school can 
supply. Ampelopsis veitehit and Clematis paniculata have been raised from

seed and distributed to schools and to the homes of the students. Bulbs 
have been planted in pots for winter forcing. Lists of plants suitable for 
withstanding the unfavorable conditions of schoolrooms have been prepared 
for the use of pupils. 
“Much attention has been given to window-box gardening. The 
preparation of the soil, the suitability of plants, and their proper arrange 
ment have been carefully studied. Special success in these window boxes 
has been obtained with Boston ferns.” 
“The work is done in Worcester, as in many other places, in the nature- 
study period. The outdoor work is preceded by simple informal lessons in
-P-A-G-E-182

the class room. The children bring tools from home. It has been necessary 
for the teacher to buy soil every two or three years, as the steep grade of 
the yard causes the ground to be deeply washed. To most of the children 
this work is an incentive for home gardens, and the improvement of the 
surrounding neighborhood testifies to the value of the work at the school.” 
* * x * 
“A wild garden on one side of the building, a small vegetable garden 
on the other side, and a creditable lawn in front, bordered by luxuriantly 
blooming nasturtiums, make this building one of the most pleasing results 
of the efforts of children. A school yard planted by a gardener is good if 
the work ean be done in no other way, but the one that best serves its edu- 
cational value is planted by children, no matter how small the ground or 
how crude the result. It is in such a garden that moral teaching is accom- 
plished.” 
* * * * 
“Clematis, climbing roses, English ivy, and the trumpet creeper, as 
well as moon vines and other annuals, were planted along fences and wood

The planting of 250 forsythias along the walks to the buildings will be 
of permanent value. These plants were made by the girls from cuttings from 
shrubs in the grounds of the Department of Agriculture.”

“Tree seeds have been collected in the parks of the city in the autumn 
and kept in sand during the winter. In the spring the ground has been 
plowed by the students with a hand plow, the seeds being planted in accord- 
ance with the directions given in Bulletin No. 29 of the Bureau of Forestry 
of the Department of Agriculture. Weeding occasionally during the sum- 
mer is all the work that has been required. The nursery now contains 
about 400 young trees.”

“The simple principles of landscape gardening are taught—popularly 
known as the A B C of gardening: (A) Keep open center; (B) plant in 
masses; and (C) avoid straight lines.”

“This plan has been followed successfully for two years. At the 
beginning of vacation the garden is so attractive that it is little trouble 
to form volunteer committees of children to report once a week throughout 
the summer to water and cut the grass and work the flower beds. The 
attendance has been large. Each student in the normal class comes once 
a week for three weeks to direct the work.”

“The children do this work with no reward in view other than the beautifying of the grounds. Civic pride is taught and respect for the prop-

erty rights of others is learned. While stealing and vandalism were weekly 
occurrences the first summer the gardens were in existence, not one case 
was reported during 1904.”

“Plantain and dandelions have been troublesome weeds in the lawns. 
The older children measured the area and calculated how many flower 
heads, if allowed to seed, a plant must bear to take entire possession of the 
lawn. This, of course, has been done with the supposition that every seed 
grows and has a given space. This is practical, in that it teaches the neces- 
sity of preventing the ripening of the seeds of weeds.” 
* * * * 
“Philadelphia, Boston, New York, and St. Louis, with their large for- 
eign quarters, have felt the need of a work that will turn the children toward 
the country; so in those places the subject has been worked out on large 
areas, subdivided into many small plats, where children are taught the 
value of intensive farming on small tracts.” 
“To test the value of gardening as a suitable form of manual training 
for boys below the seventh grade, a sixth-grade class of boys was selected 
to work the land assigned the normal school on the grounds of the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture.” 
* * * * 
“Study of soils, fertilizers, seed sowing and mulching was made before 
the outdoor work began. Each boy was assigned a plat 10 by 17 feet, 
paths two feet wide separating the plats. The measuring was done by the 
boys and was the most difficult part of the work.” 
* * od * 
“There is no better object lesson to a lazy or careless boy than the 
little plants appearing above ground. Such boys at this time will sometimes 
hoe up their entire plats and replant them, because of the great difference 
apparent between their gardens and those of the more careful pupils. All 
things are not suitable for such small plats. Among vegetables, radishes, 
lettuce, onions, bush beans, and tomatoes, if trained to stakes, are the most 
satisfactory to children; petunias, nasturtiums, sweet alyssum, and ver- 
benas flower all summer, so a bunch of flowers may be taken home at every 
lesson.” 
* * * * 
“By putting in a crop as soon as one has been exhausted, on a sixteenth 
of an acre these sixth-grade boys raised 336 bunches of radishes, 110 bunches 
of onions, 368 heads of lettuce, 89 bunches of beets, 8 bushels of beans, 7 
bushels of tomatoes, 7 bunches of carrots, and 1 peck of turnips, besides 
nasturtiums and petunias, many boxes of which found their way to the hos- 
pitals of the city.”

“At regular market prices $55 worth of produce has been gathered 
from this small plat. Experienced farmers sometimes fail to do as well.” 
“There is no question in the minds of those in charge of the value of 
the work. Proof was given the first season of the influence on the homes 
of the boys. With little expenditure for tools, fertilizers, and seeds, and in 
some cases renting land near schools, such opportunities could be given to 
every sixth-grade boy in the city.” 
The Horticultural Society of Springfield, Mass., with the codperation 
of the City Forester and the Springfield Republican, have for two years 
encouraged the beautifying of school and home grounds by means of prize 
contests. Circulars giving cultural directions for trees and ornamental 
shrubs best adapted for city use are circulated. The newspaper donates 
the prizes. 
B. Home Garpenine AssociaTION, CLEVELAND, OHIO 
The Home Gardening Association of Cleveland is the originator of 
the method of encouraging home gardening by the selling of penny packages 
of seed. The work is not confined to children. Earnest workers of the 
Goodrich House Settlement started the association, which aims to reach 
adults as well as children, and they find the garden the readiest means of 
entrance to the homes.

The seeds are delivered the first of May. Lessons are given in the 
schoolroom on the ways to plant and the care of the gardens. To supple- 
ment these lessons, the association distributes cards containing the follow- 
ing instructions: 
DIRECTIONS FOR THE CARE OF THE GARDEN 
Plant seeds in garden or boxes early in May. 
Fill boxes with 4 or 5 inches of fine, rich soil. 
Place boxes in sunny place and sprinkle every day. 
Cover boxes at night if very cold. 
Transplant seedlings to the garden about June 1, on a damp day. Sow seeds of calliopsis, nasturtiums, morning-glories, and four-o’clocks in the garden, as they do not stand transplanting. 
SUGGESTIONS FOR WINDOW BOXES 
Make a box 6 or 8 inches deep, 12 to 15 inches wide, and as long as the window is wide. 
Fill the boxes with fine rich soil and fasten firmly to the sunniest window. 
Place similar boxes on the porch or fence. 
Plant morning-glories on the side nearest the house and train up on strings. 
Plant climbing nasturtiums near outside, to hang down over the box. 
Plant calliopsis, zinnias, marigolds, asters, or verbenas in middle of box. 
Boxes need water every day. 
MAKING OF YOUR FLOWER BEDS 
Select sunniest part of the yard. 
Avoid a place where the dripping from the roof will fall on the bed. 
Best effects are produced by planting all of one variety in one place. 
PREPARATION OF THE SO1L 
Dig up the bed, as early as possible, a foot deep. 
Mix with the soil some rich earth, well-rotted manure, or leaf mold from the woods. 
Rake the beds and keep the soil fine and free from lumps. 
PLANTING OF SEEDS 
See directions on the seed packet. 
WATERING OF THE GARDEN 
Sprinkle the beds every day, if necessary, until the plants are 1 inch high. 
Do not allow the soil to become too dry. , ok , 
Sprinkle thoroughly every few days when the plants are 2 or 8 inches high, instead of 
lightly every day. . | 
Water in the morning and evening.
-P-A-G-E-186
PLAY COURSE IN FORESTRY AND GARDENING 187 
THINNING OF PLANTS IN THE GARDEN 
Avoid having plants too crowded. 
_ Thin the plants when they are 2 or 3 inches high, on a cloudy day, when the soil is moist. 
Transplant seedlings pulled up to another bed, or give them to some friend. Take up a little soil with each plant. 
Use a trowel, and old kitchen fork, or small, flat, thin stick. 
PICKING OF FLOWERS 
Do not allow flowers to go to seed. 
Pick them every day and more will bloom. 
Allow a few of the best flowers to go to seed for next year’s garden. 
Keep beautiful fresh flowers in your house and share them with the sick. 
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 
Dig deep and make the soil fine on the surface. 
Keep pulling out the weeds all summer. 
Sprinkle the seeds every day. 
Water the bed thoroughly every few days during the whole summer. 
Pick your flowers every day. 
Keep your garden neat. 
Flowers require attention all summer.

C. ExprriMENTATION 
The United States Department of Agriculture conducts the biggest 
correspondence school in the world. Youth is preéminently the time for 
experimentation. . Through the children, the agricultural methods of the 
country can be entirely remodelled. We have a small brother, who is of 
an experimental turn of mind, as are most children. We have introduced 
him to the Department of Farmers’ Free Bulletins, a list of which may 
be secured by addressing your Representative in Congress, and through 
play he is learning a great many new things about farming methods. 
The various agricultural colleges of the states will gladly furnish infor- 
mation regarding new methods upon application. We think that the chil- 
dren should get in the habit of using these means of education. 
D. Creation or New SPEcIES 
Hybridization and the creation of new species offers a wonderful field 
for attracting the interest of the children to the soil and its possibilities. 
Tell them the story of Burbank and his wonderful achievements. ‘The 
process of hybridization is so simple that any seven-year old child could 
do it. Simply shake the pollen from the stamens of one species onto the 
stigma of the variety you wish to hybridize; then collect the seeds, plant 
them, select the best specimens, hybridize the best ones again and repeat. 
There are many beautiful flowers which may be obtained, hundreds of 
varieties of wild grasses that may beat anything we have in our mowings
-P-A-G-E-187

now. The Department of Agriculture will be glad (o assist. Don’t attempt 
to make the play gardening of children too matevialistic or economic. 
Childhood is the time of experimentation. 
Appropriate vines and hedge plants are needed for the landscape gar- 
dening of playgrounds; vines which a baseball will not injure. Perhaps 
the children can develop these. ‘The Department of Agriculture is trying 
to introduce the culture of basket willows. Why not have a part in the 
playground, or space in the big parks where the children can raise willows 
for their own baskets, for use in making willow huts, etc. Basket willows 
would make a good screen for separating the different parts of the play- 
ground. 
  E. A Puan or Reroresration 
One of the most serious problems which our country has to face is the 
destruction of the forests. The whole country could be reclothed with 
trees inside of three years by the proper organization of school children, 
who would plant the seed and then transplant the seedlings in the place 
where they are to grow. The Massachusetts Board of Forestry is attempting 
to introduce the study of trees into the public schools. The danger is, that 
children will learn about trees and not plant them. Through country 
playgrounds, we think this work could be extended quicker than any other 
way, for play directors have the ability to lead and direct the interests of 
the children. An organization of “Forest Crusaders” might be formed. 
The little bits of tots could be “dryads” and plant the seeds. The bigger 
ones could be “elves” and transplant the little trees. The boys and girls seven to eleven could be “rangers” and take care of the small trees. The 
big boys could be “foresters” and could range the woods and fields collect- 
ing seeds. 
The children in the cities could plant such trees as are adapted for 
street ornamentation and for shade on playgrounds. ‘They could also 
raise shrubs for the decoration of home and public grounds. The public 
schools of Springfield are doing something of this nature, but without any 
particular organization. The organization could be made the whole thing: 
Each tree that a child plants might have his name on it or near it, and 
membership in the “crusaders” to continue while the trees lived. Compe- 
tition might be introduced. The plan presents unlimited possibilities. 
The children of a city playground might raise forest tree seedlings and 
plant them for farmers in the districts not too far from the city, and more 
than cover the expense of a camping trip.

CHAPTER XXIV 
Pets anD THE DoMESTICATION OF ANIMALS 
The domestication of animals has played an important part in the 
development of the race. The responsibility and care needed for success 
in raising and using them has created in the normal man a love for these 
dumb creatures, who look to us for support, and who in return give us of 
their strength and love unsparingly. The child who does not have a pet to 
care for can never be a normal man or woman. Every playground should 
have a cat, a dog, pigeons, rabbits, white mice, guinea pigs, perhaps canary 
birds, and a fish pond, not necessarily large. Los Angeles has a good style 
to copy. Wherever there is space a playground cow and horse would be 
an admirable addition. They might be installed at the playground camp 
in the big park. The children could take turns in being “allowed” té milk 
the cow for a week, and take care of the horse. 
The cow could furnish the milk, cream and butter, for the play house- 
keeping. 
The horse could be used to do odd jobs connected with the play- ground system, to take the children on camping excursions and to serve as 
conveyance when one playground in the city visits another playground. 
The cities’ condemned fire horses can be purchased very cheaply for this 
purpose or perhaps they might be donated. The horse could plow up the 
children’s gardens and haul cinders in winter. The plan presents many 
opportunities for development. Toads ought to be secured and kept on 
the playground. Dr. Hodge’s “Studies” have proved conclusively the 
value of nature study and the love of animals in the education of the youth. 
In the country, wild animals can be caught and domesticated. Fish could 
be supplied to the small streams. The fish growing wild in a natural lake 
were tamed by the assistant editor when a little girl, so that they would 
follow her up and down along the shore. She would take them out in her 
hands, keeping them out until they showed signs of distress, putting them 
in little cans of water and then putting them back in the lake. Immediately 
after they would return to be played with again. Dr. Hodge has succeeded 
in taming and domesticating the native rough grouse of New England. The 
Boston Globe, June 6, 1909, has a full-page article describing his methods. 
Dr. Hodge, speaking of the educational value of the study of animals, 
gives the incident of some boys, who were bothering a spider. He asked 
them if they knew the spider was a sailor, and he proceeded to show them 
how he could sail on the water. When children are cruel to animals, it 1s 
usually not from a feeling of vindictiveness, but they are investigating and 
don’t know a better way to do it. The field presents great possibilities in 
play education.

Home Mane Equipment 
A. Tue Apvantaces or Home Maver Equipment 
The construction of home made apparatus is exceedingly simple. 
There is no reason why any mechanic cannot make everything necessary 
provided the proper specifications are furnished. ‘There are distinct 
advantages in having apparatus made up at home. They are:— 
At the prices which the machine companies charge, equipments can 
be made by local labor at from one-half to two-thirds the prices charged 
by the machine companies. 
‘The money is kept in your own city. Your own trades people receive 
the benefit therefrom and your own workmen get the work. 
The manufacture of play equipments offers an aim and object to 
manual training work, which will not compete with any other established 
line of business. Furthermore the children will enjoy very much more a 
playground which they have made for themselves. A school in Minneap- 
olis has just manufactured the entire equipment for its playground. The 
playground children of Washington, Indianapolis, Philadelphia and 
Boston have assisted with the manufacture of their own playground equip- 
ments. With regard to Philadelphia, Mr. Stetcher says: 
__ All grounds also have occupation work both during the morning and afternoon. For this suitable material is supplied, like reed for basketry, split cane for seat-caning, twine jor 
hammocks, wood for woodwork, and the well-known paper materials employed in the kinder- garten and lowest primary grades, While formerly the larger children kept everything they 
made during the occupation hours, efforts have been made, during the last years, to turn this 
class of constructive work into channels that would directly benefit the playgrounds. It is 
pleasure to report that these efforts have been entirely successful. There is no loss of interest, 
when, as at present, besides making small articles for themselves, the children make play appa- 
vatus for their own ground as well as for other grounds. We now manufacture hammock stan 
and hammocks, so that “little mothers” bringing babies to the playgrounds can put the babies 
into a safe place under the charge of one girl or boy while the rest have a chance to play. 
miniature of two styles of these stands is shown in the Philadelphia exhibit. We further 
manufacture stilts, stands for high jumping, tether bats, jumping boards, benches, seats for 
swings, checker-boards, grace hoops, and minor play materials of a like order. All children ike 
this occupation work. 
We consider that such playgrounds will be much more valuable than 
the ready made ones, so that if apparatus were more expensive when made 
by the children, we should still advise that they make it and receive the 
training it would give. 
The same principle also applies to the landscape gardening of play- 
grounds which should be done by the children as much as possible. 
The playground plans, descriptions and specifications which follow 
have been designed from the knowledge gained by ten years of very close

connection with playground work. They are also designed especially to 
conform to the abilities of rather unskilled labor. Our equipments have 
always been made and erected by common park employees. We think

B. Common Sense in PLaycrounp Equipment 
There has been an immense amount of money wasted in the past 
few years on playground equipment. It has been thought necessary to 
have an elaborate equipment whenever there has been money enough to 
buy it. As a result we have numerous exhibits of pipe fitting and open 
plumbing stuck around in the various playgrounds of the country like 
pillars in the Sahara Desert, mute reminders of the development of styles 
of playground equipment. Chief among these is the gymnasium at 
Wood Island Park. If no apparatus whatever had been put on this 
playground and if the money invested in equipment could have been spent 
for adequate supervision it would have been enough to have maintained 
the playground in its proper condition probably from its origin to the present 
time.
-P-A-G-E-194
HOME MADE EQUIPMENT 195 
Most of the playground apparatus used to-day is simply indoor gym- 
nasium apparatus adapted for outdoor use. It is often put up with an 
entire disregard for the children’s desire and need. Most of the apparatus 
which is at all valuable is that which the children have themselves developed, 
for instance the swing. We have no doubt that the first swing was invented 
by one of our “long-tailed ancestors,” and consisted of grapevine hanging 
from a limb. The children of the race have consequently been rehearsing 
this stage of development to the present time, so that anything which 
swings is attractive to them. The same principle holds true with ladders, 
especially so if they are arranged so that the means of exit will be different 
from the place of entrance. Joseph Lee, in his admirable article on “A 
Home Playground,” describes this trait of the children;* and in speaking 
of playground apparatus, he says— 
The principle announced by the great English educator, Edward Thring, is a sound 
one. Whenever you can get a piece of wood or other inanimate object to do a certain piece 
of work for you, don’t call upon the nerve tissue of your teachers to do that piece of work. 
Apparatus can largely meet the desire of the boy to show how great he is by the performance 
of marvelous feats. It has also the two other functions of serving to attract boys who may 
come to perform on the rings and stay to play a game, and of being a method by which the 
shy boy who does not happen to belong to any particular gang can find something to do and 
so get to be one of the playground crowd. 
Now, apparatus which requires a teacher to get the children to use it 
and which does not appeal to their inherent interest has no place on the 
playground. The play director’s time can be used to better advantage in 
teaching games than in keeping the children doing heavy apparatus 
work. 
Dr. Arnold’s paper on some inexpensive playground apparatus de- 
livered before the Playground Congress was apropos. Not a great deal of 
apparatus is necessary although it has its place. Dr. Arnold speaks of the 
following :} 
C. Some Inexpensive PLaycrounp APPARATUS 
‘Tue Jumpine Prr. An excavation ten or more feet wide, thirty or more feet long, 
three or more feet deep at one of the narrow sides, running from this depth diagonally up- 
ward to the upper edge at the other narrow end. The sides of this pit are made secure 
by stout planks, properly prepared to withstand moisture. The ground around is well 
evened up. . . . 
The bottom of the pit is free of stones, and covered with at least six inches, if possible 
more, of good sand. In this pit babes may enjoy the sand Play. Deep jumping from the 
sides at various heights into the sand is enjoyed by smaller childre: ‘or broad jumping, 
standing and running it is excellent. The first attempts at pole vaulting may be made from 
the edge of this pit. Sith some assistance tumbling may be done from the edges into the pit. 
The sand used in this jumping pit should be soft quick sand if the same can be obtained. 
‘This is far superior to sharp sand, or building sand. This jumping pit is the best city sub- stitute for a sand bank. You all remember going Mayflowering and spending half the time 
jumping off the sand bank. The jumping pit combined with the horizontal ladder which is 
described later gives practically the same effect and is better adapted for use in schoolyards 
and for very small playgrounds.

196 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
Tue Batancinc Tree. A large and perfectly straight tree fifty or more feet long with the bark removed is supported by two or three wooden feet, one at the extreme thick end, the other sufficiently far from the inner end to allow the thiu end free play to swing. At the thicker end the tree may be two or more feet in diameter. It tapers to an end four to six inches in diameter, which is free to swing. ‘Ihe tree is so supported that its thicker end and its upper edge would be three to three and a half feet from the ground. The tree is then placed securely on its feet so that its long axis is horizontal. This tree, as iis name implies, gives a chance for balancing exercises on a broad and steady and also on a 
more and more narrow surface, which sways and swings. It may be used for deep jumping and vaults of all kinds. In the more solid parts of the tree holes may be drilled and pommels may be fastened on it; then we have it serve all the purposes of a horse and saddle-boom. Children may ride on it astride, may swing on the movable part, and should in that position find great enjoyment. 
Tue Hnock. A small elevation on the playground, two to five feet high, from three to six feet wide at the base, tapering off toward the top, well covered with turf.” Deep jump- 
ing, high jumping and hurling may be done on, and off, and over this. Pole vaulting from it may be taught. This gives opportunity for the much enjoyed frolic, rolling of children. In 
winter, when it is covered with show, it gives a fine start for the sled. It invites war games 
for the possession of the top of it. 
Tur Cumeme Tree. A straight tree no less than thicty feet high, made smooth, but 
not necessarily altogether even, is securely implanted. Its top is protected by a platform 
sufficiently wide not to allow its edges to be grasped by the climber. While this apparatus 
serves climbing primarily until the ingenuity of the child makes it the center for the other 
games, it furthers that type of climbing which is the normal and natural one, and which 
can be practised only on trees and for which the gymnasium climbing-pole gives no chance at all. ‘0 of these may be made the end-support of the playground swings, poles, etc. 
Tur Jumpine Srams. Wooden stairs of ordinary construction leading with ten or twelve steps to a height of from six to eight feet run either to a platform, or better, to stairs of the same type leading down on the other side of the platform. If the sides of this are enclosed by boards, and a door is cut in, it may be made the receptacle for playground hand apparatus. These stairs are surrounded on all four sides with sand, of at least six inch thickness. Any one who has ever watched the great fondness of children for jumping will know that the installation of this apparatus is only half completed before the children are beginning to make use of it for broad, high, and deep jumping. It may once more be used to start pole-vaulting. Some tumbling may be done from it. On the solid side of it ‘angels may be painted. ‘The sand around it gives a good place for the sand play of small children, but also for a free bout of friendly wrestling of boys. 
These pieces of apparatus cost but little to install, are well-nigh indestructible, eost 
therefore little or nothing for repairs, take up little space, lend themselves to a thousand and 
one uses at the hands of the playground instructor, and, what is still better, suggest as many 
and more uses to the child himself. 
In Louisville the play directors were on the grounds six hours a day and during that 
time the children were allowed to play on the grass, consequently the swings and giant strides 
were entirely deserted while organized play was going on. After the teacher left the grounds 
such of the children as desired went into the gymnasiums and used the apparatus. 
D. Waar Apparatus To Have 
The following apparatus we have found the most valuable to the 
playground: 
Swings, see-saws, giant strides, horizontal and parallel bars are the safest, most useful and the cheapest articles of playground equipment. 7 he 
open air gymnasium with ladders, travelling and trick rings, trapeze, climb- 
ing and sliding poles, give the children opportunity for development of
-P-A-G-E-196
HOME MADE EQUIPMENT 197 
arms and trunk and serve the psychological purpose of attracting atten- 
tion to the playground; the effect is impressive. However, we have found 
that interest in the gymnasium apparatus wears off. Where only a 
limited amount of money is available, the outdoor gymnasium frame 
should be dispensed with. 
A merry-go-round, designed to be used in the playground without 
danger of accident, would be a most valuable feature. Jumping standards, 
spring boards and playground slides are also very popular. \The teeter 
ladders and revolving see-saw, or “flying Dutchman,” give lots of fun, but 
are best adapted to large children; and then accidents are apt to happen if 
not closely watched. 
The slide for life strikes me as being one of the best pieces of apparatus 
available. 
In passing judgment on playground apparatus, the following points 
should be considered: 
(a) Is it safe? ‘Will it run itself, or will some one have to stay by it 
all the time to keep the children from accidents? ~The teeter ladder and 
“flying Dutchman” are examples of apparatus interesting but somewhat 
unsafe. 
(b) Does it appeal to some fundamental instinct so that it will be inter- 
esting after the novelty wears off? Climbing poles and ladders, for instance. 
Any pieces of apparatus which include the act of falling, swinging, or glid- 
ing, conquering time and space, seem to take the place of foreign travel 
to the city child, and are intrinsically interesting. The horizontal and 
parallel bars, other gymnastic apparatus, jumping standards, etc., depend 
upon competition and teaching for their interest. 
(c) Simplicity. The less adjustability the better from an administra- 
tive standpoint. Have different sizes of apparatus for children of different 
ages. 
(d) Expense. 
(e) Durability. In all probability the city would be liable for acci- 
dents occurring from breakage of apparatus. 
Playground apparatus which can stand 365 days of hard service each 
year, during the rains of spring, alternating with blistering sunshine and 
alkali dust, together with dry heat for the rest of the year, is hard to find. 
Last year two complete gymnasium equipments of a standard make were 
purchased for use in the playgrounds of one city. It was found necessary 
this year to replace all the rope and wooden parts with the exception of 
the ladders which are preserved by varnishing and dressing every few 
weeks. 
During the first part of my experience as supervisor of playgrounds 
we didn’t have the money to purchase ready-made apparatus, so I had to
-P-A-G-E-197

make it. After acquiring the habit it goes against the grain to pay money 
needed for land or teacher, for equipment which is not just what is wanted, 
when more satisfactory apparatus can be made at two-thirds the cost. 
See also Joseph Lee, Home Playground Proceedings, 190%; same, Play and Playgrounds—Our Civic League; same, A System of Playgrounds, Chautauquin, June, 19U6. 
E. Marerrars 
Wood and rope should be dispensed with as far as possible in the 
construction of playground apparatus, and galvanized metal wire cable 
and galvanized chain should take its place. 
1. Rope. If rope is used it should be 3” strand, best quality Manilla 
rope. Baby swings can be made with }” three strand Manilla rope. All 
rope before using should be uncoiled and hung outdoors so that it will be 
exposed to the rain and to the effect of the sun. It should be stretched 
until the stretch is‘all out of it and then it should be tarred with a thin solu- 
tion of pine tar. 
2. Sree, Capt AND Hemp Roper. There isa variety of rope which we 
think will last for years if not forever. It is made of small strands of 
steel wire, closely twisted and then wound with tarred hemp, after which 
each strand is made up into rope. It is, however, very expensive, but 
in the long run we think it would be cheaper than Manilla, because it 
would be unnecessary to make repairs. 3” rope would be the smallest size 
which is practicable to use. This size costs 21 cents to 25 cents per foot 
wholesale, while 3” Manilla rope costs only about three cents a foot or less. 
3. Frames. Three inch standard wrought iron pipe is the best material 
which can be used in making frames. These pipes should be set in con- 
crete and they may be held together by standard “tees” and “ells,” or 
universal frame clamps may be used. ‘The use of these clamps is described 
later and they make a great saving in the cost of erection. 
In a country where timber is cheap wood frames may be advisable. 
Wooden uprights may be used with pipe tops. The timber can be used 
and fitted to the Universal Clamps. Red-wood bears contact with the 
ground well and would be good for uprights. 
4. Fricriontuss Jomrs. There are no perfect frictionless joints on 
the market. Ball bearing joints become clogged with dirt and sand so 
that they wear out. Dr. Curtis maintains that they make the swings run 
easy and that the children want to swing in them all day and this seems to 
us quite reasonable. There are children whose only wish in life seems to 
be swinging and special efforts should be made to get them out of that 
stage. A little swinging is good—too much is bad for the child. The only 
value of frictionless joints is to prevent wear and accidents. The rockers 
to rocking joints wear out unless they are made of hardened steel which 
is quite expensive. The perfect joint is still to be discovered
-P-A-G-E-198
HOME MADE EQUIPMENT 199 
5. Woon. ‘The kind of wood used will depend to a certain extent upon 
the piece of apparatus. When considerable strength with extreme lightness 
is desired, New England spruce is the best. Southern or Long Leaf Pine is 
about as strong as spruce, perhaps a little stronger but much heavier. 
White ash is light and very strong. 'These three woods are all more or less 
subject to splintering. The Southern Pine perhaps splinters the least of 
any of them. Washington fir or Washington pine or spruce, as it is some- 
times called, is very similar to New England spruce and much easier to 
obtain. It is especially good about warping. White oak is a very tough, 
close grained wood, which does not splinter and is valuable for anything 
which receives considerable wear, such as swing boards, climbing poles, etc. 
It stands the weather well but is very apt to check. Hickory is the strongest 
of the woods, but does not stand the weather well. Rock maple is a fine, 
close grained wood, which wears well and is not affected badly by moisture. 
(It is the wood usually used in making washing machines.) Rock maple is 
good for use on playground slides, and is one of the cheapest woods. Do 
not get white maple; it is no good. 
To secure the best results all wood used in the construction of play- 
ground apparatus should be very carefully kiln-dried, after which it should 
be either soaked in linseed oil or covered with enough coats to nearly satu- 
rate it. After it is dried a coat of shellac should be applied, then a coat of 
the best spar varnish. All parts which go into the ground should be covered 
with one or two coats of tar. 
Boiled linseed oil gives the best finish to the wood but it is more ex- 
pensive than raw linseed oil. There are a number of waterproofing ma- 
terials for wood on the market and if any one would care to test any of them 
we would be glad to furnish the addresses of the houses selling them. This 
might be an interesting study to some of the playground manual training 
instructors or students. 
6. Concrete. Directions for making concrete can be secured from any 
of the wholesale dealers in Portland Cement. We have used both natural 
and Portland Cement in erecting frames. The concrete made from natural 
cement was 1 to 3 mixture which means 1] part cement, 1 part sand, and 3 
parts crushed rock or clean gravel. The proportions of 1 part cement, 2 
or 24 parts sand, and 3, 5 or 8 parts of gravel or crushed rock, are recom- 
mended for use with some brands of cement. Where gravel is used not 
so much sand is needed. When using the Portland Cement we used the 
1 to 5 mixture. Most contractors when setting up your equipment of 
apparatus for you would use a 1 to 8 mixture, especially if you were not 
looking. And for this reason it is best always to set up your own frames. 
Concrete should be mixed rather dry so as to tamp in place.

smooth. Two inch galvanized pipe uprights, with 2” x 8” flanges on the 
bottom should be used. Each of these should be set on a bed of concrete 
2’ x 18”, so that the bars would be 15” apart for boys and 18” apart for 
men. The usefulness of the bars will increase if the pipe uprights are set 
in at an angle so that the bottoms are 8” farther apart than the tops. 
Wooden bars may be used for the tops; these should be of white oak or 
hickory and should be not over 9” long. Both wood and metal bars are 
attached to uprights by castings which cost about fifty cents apiece. When 
these castings are used the bars may be taken in at night.

Levetiinc THE Grounp. Dig the holes about 44’ deep, drive stakes 
in the ground on the outside of hole N and hole K. About 6” above the 
surface of the ground attach a stove pipe wire to the stake at hole N and 
run this stove pipe wire over to the stake at hole K. Then take a carpenter's 
or mason’s level and hold it midway between the 2 holes, against the under 
side of the stove pipe wire. Have your assistant raise or lower the loose 
end of the wire until the wire is very nearly level, then drive stakes outside 
holes L and M in line with the other 2 stakes so that when the wire rests 
upon the top of these stakes last driven, it will in all of its parts be level. 
After this has been accomplished, take 4 stakes about 10” or 12” long, and 
drive them down in the bottom of each hole until the top of each stake is 
equidistant from the stove pipe wire. The distance from the top of the 
ground to the top of the stakes should be approximately 4’; if the ground 
is on a slant an average should be struck. After the stakes are driven prop- 
erly, fill the holes with conerete up to the top of the stake, and while this 
is drying put your frame together.

with an old bat club or other piece of hard wood, this feat can be accom- 
plished with 1 wrench. Next take pipes B and C and put their lower ends 
just by the near edges of the holes and screw the other ends into the elbow 
X, which is connected to pipe H. Then screw the elbows on the outside 
ends of pipes G and I, then screw the other ends of these 2 pipes into the 
tees (J). Next screw pipes A and D into the elbows which are attached to 
the ends of pipes land G. Next take a chalk line and get the lower ends of 
pipes A, B, C and D in a straight line, with their lower ends just resting 
over the inside edge of the hole. The next process is to get four boys to 
hold planks on the sides of the holes opposite the ends of the pipe (this is to 
keep the pipe from digging holes, when it is raised). Place a good husky 
laborer back of each pipe with a short piece of 2 x 4; station your foreman 
back of pipe H with a long 2 x 4 (about 16’ long) and have 2 x 4s about 
12’ long within easy reach back of pipes A, B, C and D. Have your men 
get underneath and take a lift, holding the frame up, with the short 2 x 4s, 
while they rest, and so on until the frame is in the bottom of the hole. Line 
up all the pipes and plumb them, holding them in place by 2 x 4s nailed 
across each other on each pipe, and bracing the ends of the two outside 
pipes A and D. As soon as all pipes are in line and plumbed, put in the 
concrete, which should be a 5 to 1 mixture with Portland cement.

is hardening.

Erxcrion or THE Frame. The universal fitting makes the erection 
of the frame a very easy matter. After the holes are levelled on the bottom, 
set up the 2 outside pipes, with the proper fittings loosely attached. Brace 
these pipes by means of three 2 x 4s nailed together so that their bases form 
a triangle. Get the pipes plumb, and then concrete them. The 2 center 
pipes are to be erected in the same way. 
After the concrete has hardened, take the 2 lower top pipes, lift up 
into place in the clamps using a step ladder, then bolt into place. Standing 
on top of these 2 pipes haul up the highest pipe, lay that on top and bolt 
into place. Care must be taken, of course, to line up the 4 upright pipes.

  HOME-MADE SWING FITTINGS 
DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING HOME-MADE SWING FITTING 
This fitting can be made by the Manual Training class in forging or 
by a blacksmith. The detail is shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. B is a wrought Iron or mild steel band 5-16” x 14”, bent to fit around 3” pipe (which is 34” outside measurement). Hole is drilled through the bottom ends of this band 
and a }” x 24” hexagon head and nut machine bolt (C) is inserted through, 
holding in place hook (A) which is made of }” wrought iron, and upon 
which the eye to the swing or other apparatus hangs. It is advisable to put 
these fittings on the pipe before the frame is put together, as it will be difi- 
cult to get them to fit the pipe without considerable hammering. 
  HOME-MADE SWING BOARD AND ATTACHMENT 
HOME MADE SWING BOARD AND ROPE PROTECTIVE ATTACHMENT 
Fig. 1 is an end view of the swing board and Fig. 2 shows one side. 
There are various opinions regarding the proper weight for swing boards. 
The heavier they are, the less danger of their breaking, and the greater 
danger there is of their breaking the children’s heads. We have always 
preferred to save heads, perhaps at the expense of the boards, and for this
-P-A-G-E-217
218 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
reason have always made our swing boards of the following dimensions 
and materials. Kiln dried oak }” x 6” x 18”, with the corners rounded ona 
quarter circle and the edges smoothed and sanded. ‘These boards should 
be given 4 or 5 coats of linseed oil, or better still soaked for a week in the oil. 
The rope protective attachment is shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. The 
wire (C) is made of 3” stock with a loop up at the top (A) and the bottom 
ends are threaded and run through the boards and through an iron plate 
(B) at the bottom of the board near the ends. Then a nut (D) is screwed 
onto the stirrup. This plate underneath is }” x 3” x 54”, with the ends 
rounded so as to have no sharp points. It is held in place upon the board 
by means of a couple of screws. The distance from the end of the board 
to the center of the hole, through which the stirrup goes, is 14”. The dis- 
tance from the sides of the board to the center of the hole through which the 
stirrup runs should be 1”. 
‘The method of attaching rope to this stirrup is as follows: Rope is run 
down through the loop (A) in under the place where the 2 wires forming 
the loop cross each other, and then back again through the loop (A) in 
the opposite direction from which it went through first. Then the end is 
spliced into the perpendicular piece of rope. Fig. 2 gives a good idea of 
the way this will look when completed. This crossing of the rope makes 
a firm hitch and does away with the necessity of using a rope eve at this 
point, which we consider dangerous as the children are liable to catch their 
hands in it. 
  SPLICE FOR PLAYGROUND APPARATUS 
Eve Spxice ror Usr on PLaycrounp Apparatus. ‘The home-made 
swing fitting requires that the rope hanging from it be spliced around a 
galvanized eye. The method of splicing is as follows: 
Unravel the three strands of rope and lay them across the main body 
of the rope in the order A, B, C, as shown in Fig. 1. Push strand C through 
the rope as shown in Fig. 2, then put strand B over the part through which 
C has passed and push under the next strand, and last push strand A 
through on the opposite side. When this is done, repeat 2 or 3 times until 
the splice assumes the form in Fig. 3. Then cut off the end and if the 
splice is to be down where the children can reach it, wind and sew with 
lashing twine. Care should be taken to pull the strands tight over the eye. 
DIRECTIONS FOR ASSEMBLING SWING USING SPECIAL CASTINGS 
A picture of this is shown on pages 98 and 221. There are a variety 
of so called frictionless joints. So far as we know none of them are friction-
-P-A-G-E-218
PLAYCRAFT 219 
less. Ball bearing joints get dry and rust and rocker fittings wear out, es- 
pecially when made of malleable iron. Of course it is very important from 
the point of safety for all attachments of playground apparatus to be so 
made that they cannot wear out even when badly neglected. We have 
tested the rocker fitting alluded to and find that when all the wearing sur- 
faces are made out of cast tool steel, the wearing qualities of the fitting are 
increased many times. Incidentally we might state that this tool steel costs 
about 3 times as much as malleable iron. 
  ROPE ATTACHMENTS 
The method of attaching rope to the eye of the rocker is as follows: 
the end of the rope is carefully wound and thrust up through the bottom 
of the hook (see Fig. 2), about 5” of the rope protruding through the mouth 
of the hook. Then take the rope and put it in a vise so that the lower edges 
of the hook rest against the jaws of the vise which is tightened to keep the 
rope from slipping out (see Fig. 1). The strands of the rope are now all 
unravelled as far as the hook, opened up, and spread out carefully so as to 
have a hole in the center with the fringe of rope equally distributed all 
around it. Then a wedge screw, which we will describe later, is inserted 
into this center of the rope and pounded down with a hammer until it fits 
inside the hook coming just below the under side of the top of the hook. 
Then a screw driver is inserted between the top of the wedge screw and 
the hook; on this screw driver blows from a hammer are applied until the 
wedge screw is pounded down into the inside of the casting, Great care 
should be taken to see that the wedge screw goes down straight and that 
it has rope on all sides of it and that the rope is not pushed down through 
the hook. If an iron vise is used it would be best to put some soft material 
like canvas over the jaws to prevent cutting the rope. After the operations 
are completed cut off the loose strands of the rope being careful to cut at 
least 1” above the top of the wedge screw.

saw the head off a lag screw). Apply a little hydrocloric acid with a stick to each piece of iron and then pour melted lead into the mold. ‘This will make a finished wedge screw, which can be used in assembling the swing. 
Swine Boarp ann Rove Prorecrivs Castine. The swing board used should be the same as that described under Home Made Swings. 
For attaching swing board to swing board rope a casting having a 
cylinder running through the board is used. This casting is screwed to 
the bottom of the board with }” screws and the rope is held inside it in the 
same manner as in the hook. The rope should be left 6” to 8” long below the swing board in order to make it possible to pull the rope out and shorten 
it up in case it stretches.

of each end. Two inches in from the outside to the center of the hole, 
commencing on the bottom side of the board, bore a hole 131” in 
diameter. This hole should be bored to the depth of 3”. Remove the bit

FIGURES 1, 2,3 AND 4~—GIANT STRIDES WITH MACHINED HEAD 
DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING GIANT STRIDES USING MACHINED HEADS 
There are two general styles of giant strides on the market illustrated 
by Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. Fig. 1 is the style head which has been developed by 
the machine companies; Fig. 2 illustrates another forma of head, the idea of 
which first came from the Boston playgrounds. It has these advantages 
over the old style, in that the balls are much larger, giving less friction and 
the fact that the ball races are much broader than in the old style gives
-P-A-G-E-222
PLAYCRAFT 223 
much less leverage. A glance at the cut will illustrate our meaning; the 
fulcrum of the lever is located at F, on the balls when power is applied at 
P by a child hanging onto the rope; the power arm of the lever, or the dis- 
tance between P and F you will note is much less in Fig. 2 than in Fig. 1, 
whereas the weight arm, the distance from F to W is much greater in Fig. 2 
than in Fig. 1, hence the leverage of the old style giant stride will be much 
greater than that of the new style; consequently we would expect that the 
giant stride shown in Fig. 2 would run very much more evenly and more 
easily, which from experiment proves to be the fact. 
Gian’ Stripe Posrs. Giant strides should wherever possible be 
placed 16’ above ground, whereas in many cases they are placed only 14’ 
above ground. Whenever space is available the greater heighth should 
be used as the children are much less liable to hit the post and the exercise 
is more enjoyable. 
Posts should be set in the ground 4’ in a bed of concrete 2’ at the top 
and 3’ at the bottom. The bottom of post should be set on a large building 
stone as illustrated in Fig. 3, or it should be placed on a small pier made 
out of concrete. Concrete should be a 5 to I mixture. 
a 
Haneurs. The hanger used will depend upon the use you wish Lo 
make of your giant stride. If you wish to make it most enjoyable to the 
children, the loop illustrated in Fig. 4 will be the best kind to use. This 
hangs very low, just above the ground, when hanging directly down. The 
children put the loop over their heads and half sit and half stand in while 
they run around, gaining momentum until they sit entirely in the loop and 
swing off from their feet. With this rope loop there is absolutely no danger 
of accidents, as there are no hard materials to strike the children. 
Another form of hanger, which perhaps gives more and better exercise 
if the children will take it, is the knotted rope hanger made in every way 
like the loop hanger, except that the lower end is knotted about every 6” 
and the children take hold of these knots with their hands while they run 
around. 
The loop hanger should be made as follows: (see Fig. 4) A loose knot 
(F) should be made in the rope, near enough to the bottom so that the loop 
when made, will be about 30” long. Through this knot the end of the rope 
is passed and a knot made in the end (E). Then both knots are pulled 
tight, and then wet and pulled tighter still. At the upper end of this 3” 
Manila rope a rope hook (D) is attached according to the directions given 
under swings with special castings. Into this hook is attached an S hook 
(B) and the other end of this S hook is attached to a 3-16" galvanized 
chain (A) which is about 18” long and continuing upward is attached into 
the eve of the giant stride as shown in Fig. 2. The completed hanger 
should be the same length as the height of the pole. The point C of hook 
D should be hammered down so that the hook cannot be removed from 
the S hook at any place but point G.

DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING WAGON SKEIN GIANT STRIDE 
This is the cheapest form of giant stride and was designed by us for 
use in St. Paul, when we had a very small appropriation. The head is 
made from an old wagon skein (Fig. 2 A) around which is fitted an iron 
ring, }” in thickness (Fig. 2B). This ring has 6}” holes drilled in it to admit 
the loop ring (D). From this ring the hangers (Fig. 1 C) are suspended. 
These hangers may be made as shown in Fig. 4, or they may be made 
without any chain at the top. If the hook is to be attached directly into the 
ring (B), the ring should have a dent (KK) made in it so that when the hook 
is turned it can easily be removed from the ring in order to take the hangers 
off at night. 
Mareriats Requirep. One 3” wagon skein, with ring as per plan, 
6 rope hooks, about 135’ of 2” Manila rope, 1 post 16’ long, 8” x 8”, with 
the corners chamfered so as not to hurt the children. Two pieces 6” x 6” x 
10’ (Fig. 3 G), 4 pieces 6” x 6” x 5’ 9” (Fig. 3 H) fitted as per plan, 1 bolt 
¥ x 19” (Fig. 3 I) and 1 bolt 2” x 23” (Fig. 3 J); these bolts are used to at- 
tach the 4 pieces H to post F. Pieces H and F are attached to pieces G 
by means of spikes. All lumber should be well seasoned southern pine or 
spruce, dressed 4 sides and finished with 2 coats best outdoor paint, except 
the part which goes in the ground and that should be coated with tar. 
It should be possible to make and erect one of these giant strides for 
$15.00 to $20.00 and it should last several seasons.

5 teeter boards complete. 
This frame is designed for the use of small children and for 12’ boards, 
as specified below. If it is desired to use 14’ boards, or to have the frame 
used by larger children, (see note). 
Nore-—The above specifications are for teeter frames using 12’ boards. 
14’ boards, however, are more desirable, the angle of the board being less 
than with the short board making accidents less numerous. If 14’ boards 
are desired, the pipe specifications so noted should be 3” longer, allowing 
the frame to be placed 3” higher from the ground. 
This style frame, using standard fittings, as specified, is the cheapest 
and best method of construction, and we recommend it in preference to the 
frame illustrated in cut. If, however, the frame assembled with universal 
fittings is desired, it will be necessary only to substitute universal ells for 
the standard ells and add two 3” caps for each teeter frame. 
DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING TEETER BOARDS 
Boarps. Boards should be made ‘of oak, Washington spruce, or 
Southern pine, preferably the first, 14” x 10” x 12’, or 14’, dressed 4 sides, 
milled as per plan appended with the ends cut on a half circle and with all 
edges rounded slightly and shaded. Boards should be finished by applying 
4 or 5 coats of boiled or raw linseed oil (the first gives the better finish), 
1 coat shellac, and 1 coat best spar varnish. 
Atracuine Boarps To Frames. There are two methods of attaching 
boards to frames; the adjustable method is shown in Fig. 3 and requires 
2 special castings, and spring steel adjuster, which goes below the pipe. 
These castings and adjustments will cost about $3.00 per board. 
Another method, and we think a cheaper and better one, is shown 
under Figs. 5 and 6. It consists of a small casting (D), which rests on the 
pipe. This casting rests upon 2 pieces of hard wood (B), which are cut 
from pieces 2” wide by 2” thick and 18” long; the radius of the circle on 
which the inner ends of these pieces (B) are cut to fit the casting (D) is 24”. 
The 4 pieces (B) are attached to the under side of the board, so that the 
outside edges of the small pieces are 4” inside the outside edge of the board. 
This places the casting in under the board, so that there is no danger of 
the children pinching their fingers or catching their clothes. The pieces 
(B) should be smoothed, sanded and finished, as per directions for finishing 
board. They are attached to board by means of }” x 44” carriage bolts (E), 
which go through the top of the board, down through the castings, where 
they are bolted. As illustrated in the drawing F is a 3” x 4” carriage bolt. 
G represents 2 }” screws, which complete the attachment.
-P-A-G-E-228
PLAYCRAFT 229 
  DETAIL OF TEETER BOARD FRAME ATTACHMENT 
We have never had any difficulty with this attachment and it has 
been in use in St. Paul for 5 or 6 years. These castings will cost about 50c 
each, or you can have them made by the forging class out of a piece of §” x 
2” mild steel. 
In order to lock up the teeter boards at night, we bored 1}” holes 
through the boards in the center about 8” in from the ends and run a chain 
through all the boards, which we laid on top of each other beside the frame, 
and securely padlocked the chain to the frame. This kept them from work- 
ing overtime. 
Estimates. 
The four board teeter frame has cost us, made up by contract, 
$25.00 to $30.00. 
The five board teeter frame we have never made up, but think 
it would cost $3.00 or $4.00 more than the other one. 
(These estimates include the boards.)

SPECIFICATIONS 
This equipment is designed for very small city back yards. It consists 
of swing frame containing 8 leather seat baby swings, 3 small wood seat 
swings. At each end of the frame is a small playground slide. Beyond 
this at one end is a sand box. Awning covering the whole equipment in 
case there is no shade. At the other side of the swings a four board teeter 
frame is placed. This leaves not quite half of the ground free for games. 
Rapidly growing vines should be placed around the fence.

the concrete and dig out the pipes. 
When the 4 uprights are set, take the 2 top pieces and connect them 
on the ground with the coupling. Then raise them up into the castings on 
top of the pipe, i. e. 2 tees and a universal ell. Then thread the end of the

The steps are }” x 3}” x 233” and fit into mortises cut in the sides 3” 
deep (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). They are all cut at an angle of 60°. Great 
care should be taken to thoroughly sand and smocth them so that the 
children will not hurt themselves. 
The top step is shown in Fig. 2. It fits directly over the steel where 
wound around rod (R). 
The connection between the slide and the ladder is shown in Fig. 4. 
A 4" x 8” carriage bolt extends through the sides of the two and through 
the upright post, which supports the awning, previously spoken about 
under Back Yard Equipment. The other side, which is next to the iron 
pipe post of the swing, is connected by a special casting, through which 
a 4” x 5” bolt end is driven and headed while hot into a hole countersunk 
in the inside of the casting (E). This casting with the bolt may be secured 
for about $1.25, or the casting may be purchased and the bolt fixed up by 
the manual training class or a fitting may be forged. 
The bottom of the slide is secured by a stake (Q) which is driven in 
the ground to a depth of 2”. This stake is 1}” x 34” x ~’ 6”, ana the steps 
are fastened to it by 2” x 4” carriage bolts (C). 
Hanp Rats. The hand rails (L) are made of 2” round iron about 
9’ long. At the top of the slide (S) it is bent so as to fit around the slide as 
shown in Fig. 9, the bend of the metal (V) being on the inside of the slide. 
A 5-16” bolt (T) which has the end (W) bent around the guard rail (L) 
is put through the side (C) at (S), as illustrated in Fig. 9. 
The lower end of the guard rail rests upon the third step from the 
bottom on the inside of the frame, and is held in place by two bolts, such as 
hold the upper end. 
Finisu. Wood used should be oak, Southern pine or maple, finished 
with one coat oil, one coat shellac, one coat spar varnish. 
Estimarrs. This slide used to cost us $12.00 to $15.00 made up in 
quantities under contract. The necessary materials ought not to cost more 
than $5.00 or $6.00. 
The slide when attached to the frame acts as a first class brace, making 
it absolutely immovable. 
A higher slide can be constructed in the same manner.

DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING COMBINATION STEEL LADDER AND CHEST BARS 
WITH JUMPING PIT, STEEL INCLINE LADDER, AND SLIDING POLES 
This combination is an ideal one for school-yard playgrounds or for 
any place where the play space is very limited. We all of us, when we were 
children, dearly loved to jump off a sand bank and this equipment brings 
the sand bank home to the city child with the added pleasure and exercise 
to be gained from use of the horizontal ladder and chest bars.

Construction. This ladder is made similar to the incline ladder 
except that the only special casting required is a very small one, which holds 
the lower pipe to the 2” upright. This plug is screwed into the end of the 
1}’ pipe and is tapped to hold a 3” x 3” countersunk head machine screw, 
which goes through the 2” pipe upright and into the center of the plug, 
holding the ladder firm. The spacing of the rungs is the same as in the other 
ladder, except that the two end rungs are placed 12” in from the ends. 
The top pipes of the ladder are threaded into 4” x 2” reducing ells. 
Erecrion. Level the holes as directed for swing frames. Assemble 
the ladder, and place in the holes. Brace in a manner similar to that used 
in bracing the swing frames, and then set in concrete. 
Estimate. Materials and labor for making up these ladders wilt 
cost $1.25 to $1.50 per foot including special castings, but not including the 
price of the special tool necessary. This special tool will cost $6.00 to $8.00 
to have made, but will last indefinitely. 
Different tools are required for the riveted ladder and for the bolted 
ladder. 
Spectra Frerines. The special fittings required for attaching Jadders 
to frames will cost about $3.00 per set. The special castings used for attach- 
ing horizontal and chest bar ladder to uprights will cost about $1.00 per set. 
These steel ladders are without question the strongest ladders which 
have ever been made, and much superior in strength and durability to the 
pressed steel ladders on the market. It looks to us absolutely impossible 
to break or wear them out.

from the end, and through the 14” pipe (D). The first holes are com- 
menced 8” down from the top end of the ladder, and from there on the holes 
are placed 10” apart, center to center. . After the holes are all drilled, they 
are all reamed out so as to enable a 2” x 32” stove bolt (E) to go through 
and screw into the nut (B) which is placed in the inside of the 1}” pipe (A) 
by means of a special tool. Another method of attaching the rungs, is to 
use 3” x 32” B. H. rivets and head them into the inside of the pipe while 
hot. This, however, is very difficult, as the rivet has a tendency to buckle
-P-A-G-E-237
238 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
when hot. This can be obviated, however, by wrapping the upper end of 
Fig t the rivet in asbestos to keep it from heating. The 
ladder rungs are 20” long, and the ends must be 
ground off perfectly smooth. The 2” holes in the ends 
of the rung are 19}” from center to center. 
SpeciaL Castings. Special castings, which fit 
into the ends of the two pipes are required to attach 
ladder to frame (Fig. 2 A, page 237). These cast- 
ings are held in place by two 2” x }” round head ma- 
chine screws, which are tapped through the pipe and 
through the casting on the inner side in such a manner 
as not to be in danger of catching the children’s 
clothes. The arch handle illustrated is unnecessary 
when this ladder is used with the combination swing 
and gymnasium frame, for which it is designed. 
  SLIDING POLES 
No wooden sliding pole should ever be used. We know of a great 
many accidents caused by slivers. In many places, where wooden poles are 
used, it is necessary to keep a man all the time dressing them down. 
Sliding poles should always be placed opposite some means of gaining 
access to them. We cannot see any use in sliding poles which end at the 
top of frame. 
Consrruction. 14” selected, smooth, galvanized pipe is the best 
material for sliding poles which we know of. Fig. 2 illustrates a pair of 
sliding poles made this way. They should be set in a small amount of con- 
crete at the bottom and should have flanges at the end. 
ATTACHMENT TO Frame. Sliding poles are attached to the frame in 
the following manner. Take two 3” x 3” x 1}” galvanized tees, have them 
reamed out and in one side of the 3” run drill a }” hole. These fittings must 
be slid onto the pipe of the frame and then the sliding poles threaded into 
them. They should be placed inside of the fittings which hold the ladder. 
After the concrete at the bottom is set, take a drill, any size up to 4”, and 
drill a hole part way into the 3” pipe of the frame. Then fill this with hot 
lead, and smooth off. The lead will keep the fittings from slipping. This 
fitting, however, has one defect in that the lip holding the 14” pipe is not 
long enough; it also is quite expensive machining the fitting out. We plan 
to design a fitting which will overcome these difficulties, and cheapen the 
cost of construction.

DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING AND ERECTING COMBINATION SWING AND GYM- 
NASIUM FRAME, AND FOR MAKING TEETER LADDER 
This play equipment has a frame made of 3” steel pipe held together 
with Universal Frame Connections, making the strongest frame which 
can be made. The ladders and sliding poles serve as braces giving abso- 
lute rigidity. 
If at any time it is desired to enlarge this frame, it can easily be made 
into a square gymnasium by duplicating for the other end and connecting 
the two ends with steel pipes. ‘The climbing pole will be removed and a 
set of traveling rings inserted. 
The upright pipe at the top of the ladder and sliding poles acts as a 
handle for the children to grasp when going from the ladder to the poles. 
Upon this frame are attached the following pieces of apparatus: 
6 11’ swings, 1 all steel incline ladder, 
1 pr. trick rings, 2 pr. all steel incline poles, 
1 steel and cable trapeze, 1 steel climbing pole, 
1 rope ladder made of steel cable with steel rungs. 
From the pipe above the incline ladder attachment can be secured 
for the Slide for Life, which is designed to extend from this place to an 
attachment upon some other piece of apparatus. 
Pier Requirep ror Frame. The following pipe is required for 
frame: 
2 pieces blk. pipe 3” x 15’, with or without threads. (A & D.) 
2 pieces bik. pipe 3” x 15’, thread lend. (E & G.)

Set in concrete as previously directed, then place pipe (G) with the right hand end resting in the hollow of casting (K). Attach to the other end on the ground steel ladder and steel sliding poles with fitting (I) attached to the pipe just outside them. Then raise the ladder and the sliding poles up into the position where they should go (or follow the same method as pre- 
viously indicated in Reprint No. 5), and afterwards attach the ladders and 
sliding poles. Pipe F is in 2 pieces, the 2 pieces being joined in the cen- 
ter of fitting K. The wide clamp and the teeth in the center, with the 
toothed arms at the side make this possible. 
Fig. 2 shows a ground plan of this frame set up. Your attention is 
called to the manner of placing the concrete for the 2 upside uprights of 
the frame. This gives the frame a very large base and when the ladders 
and sliding poles are set in concrete, it is absolutely immovable. 
Special attention is called to the method of securing the bottoms of 
the climbing poles in order to keep them from swinging around and hitting 
other pieces of apparatus. They are set in little frames of concrete (or 
wood may be used). This should be large enough to give a little play 
both ways but not enough to allow the poles to leave the box. 
Apparatus. The construction of swings, steel incline ladders and 
sliding poles are all included in articles under those headings. 
Tur Sree anp Wire Case Lapper is made as follows: 
Pieces of galvanized pipe 1” x 20” are cut and smoothed. BY holes 
are drilled }” in from the end. Then fill the ends of the pipe with paper 
and run through the holes pieces of }” steel cable, which form the sides. 
Space about 12” apart, open the strands of the wire with an awl inside the 
ends of the 1” pipe and insert therein a wire nail or a screw. Then saturate 
the inside of the pipe, wire and screw with soldering acid and fill up the 
hole with a mixture of 1 part solder and 1 part lead. This makes the most 
durable, flexible ladder that [ have ever seen. 
Special fittings for attaching to the ground and to the frame are 
required. 
Trapeze. The best home made trapeze is made as follows: Secure 
a very smooth piece of 1” galvanized pipe, 28” long, thread at both ends 
and screw on galvanized street ells. File off the threads on the outside, 
put a }” flexible steel cable through the fittings and through the pipe, 
leaving the ends long enough to give sufficient length for fastening above. 
Fill the pipe with melted lead and solder combined, after having saturated 
the inside and the cable with soldering acid. This trapeze should be at- 
tached to the frame by means of frictionless joints such as were used in 
the swings. Crosby wire rope clips should be used to hold the ends of the 
cable secure. 
Cuimpine Potrs. The climbing poles are made of selected smooth 
pieces of 14” galvanized pipe, threaded at the top and attached to the frame
-P-A-G-E-241
242 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
by a special casting. These climbing poles will last as long as any in the 
market. 
Trick Rines. Trick rings should be made of malleable, galvanized 
iron, which can be purchased. Leather and rubber covering are unneces- 
sary. The best material for attaching these to the frames is a combination 
hemp and steel tarred flexible cable, which, however, is very, very expensive, 
costing 4 or 5 times as much as }” Manila rope. If this steel cable is used, 
it is necessary to splice a loop at the bottom and to attach at the top to the 
special frame fittings by means of splices or by the use of a wire rope clip. 
At the bottom, in order to make the rings adjustable as to heighth, a leather 
strap about }” x 1}” x 6’ with a heavy harness buckle should be used for 
each ring. These straps should be thoroughly waterproofed by soaking 
in a solution of gasoline and rubber and other materials, which patented 
waterproofing fluid is on the market. In case you cannot afford the expen- 
sive indestructible rope, use }” Manila rope tarred, which should be at- 
tached at the upper end by means of rope hook, in the manner specified 
under swing construction; at the lower end another hook is attached 
and the opening pounded together; below this the strap spoken of before 
is attached connecting with the ring.

AND GIANT STRIDE COMBINED, WITH FLIPPING BOARD ATTACHMENT 
Fig. 6 
  SCHOOL YARD MERRY-GO-ROUND AND GIANT STRIDE COMBINED 
The merry-go-round gives a maximum development of pleasure to 
the greatest number of children per square foot of space occupied of any 
piece of apparatus which has ever been made. The cost, however, of these 
has made them almost prohibitive for general use. All of the machines 
of which we know have the projecting arms, which serve as application for 
motive power, not high enough above the ground to prevent them from 
striking the children, if they get in the way. The style indicated here over- 
comes both of these objections, as it can be made by the advanced manual 
training class at a cost of $40.00 to $60.00 for materials. The motive power 
is applied by means of ropes, suspended from arms, which extend out from 
the supporting rods. 
Merxop or Consrrucrion. Fig. 1 shows elevation. Fig. 4 shows 
ground plan. Fig. 2 shows method of welding }” iron arm to vertical and 
incline rods, which support the frame work. Fig. 5 shows method of attach- 
ment of 1}” steel tubing, which must be used for the arms when they are 
to be used for giant stride purposes. These arms are held by a piece welded 
to the incline rods and are attached by nuts placed on the arm on both 
sides of the vertical rods. 
The basis of construction consists of a tool steel giant stride head on 
top of the pipe and a thrust bearing, using 4” balls towards the lower end 
of the pipe. (See Fig. 1.) The wooden frame work is suspended from

the top bearing by means of six 3” vertical rods, which run through the ends of the six 2” x 4” x 4/3” timbers, which form the basis for the frame work, 
and which are fitted into slots cut in the casting; $” nuts threaded on the rods 
at the top of the timber, and-similar nuts screwed on below the casting 
keep the center from going down or up. The detail of this attachment 
to the eye of the giant stride is illustrated in Fig. 3, an eye being welded at 
the top of the vertical rod. Through this eye as illustrated in Fig. 3, is bent 
the threaded end of the 3” incline rod, which holds the outer part of the 
frame. This rod runs down through the 2” x 4” and through a small special 
casting at the bottom, where it is held in place by a nut. 
The step is held on by the frame work illustrated in Fig. 1, which is 
made by 2” x 3’s bolted at every end by two }” x 5” carriage bolts with nuts 
and washers. 
The step itself is made from solid pieces of lumber 1}” x 12” x 5’ 
milled, and then screwed down or nailed to the bottom piece of timber. 
The space above the step between it and the seat should be sheathed up, 
or a wire screen can be made similar to the back rest for seat which will be 
described later. 
The seat is made of 1” stock and is nailed to the tops of the 2 x 4 frame. 
The back rest may be dispensed with. If it is desired to make it, it 
should be done as follows: 
Bore 2 lines of 1” holes 2” apart through the seat board between each 
of the incline rods. Sets of holes should be 4” apart. 1’ up from the seat 
board, attach a piece of No. 9 galvanized steel wire; run this around spirally 
about 6 times, until the whole space from the board 1’ up is covered with 
wires about 2” apart. Each of these wires, where they cross the incline 
rods, should be wired to them by means of short pieces of No. 16 galvanized 
wire. Care should be taken, when wiring these, to have no sharp ends 
exposed to catch the children’s clothes. After these wires are all placed, 
take No. 12 galvanized wire, push up through the hole bored through the 
seat and interweave alternately with a horizontal wire to the top wire, around 
which it should be twisted and then interwoven and twisted down, alter- 
nating on the other side of each horizontal wire and back down through 
the other hole, where the two ends are twisted together. These cross wires 
should continue on around filling up all the holes. 
This back rest is not, however, absolutely necessary, but-serves as a 
convenient place to stow babies away in. If the screen is to be made, it 
must be woven on before boarding up the space between the step and the 
Seat. 
Tur Motive Power ArracHMENT. One or two #” iron rods with an 
eye at the end, as indicated in Fig. 1, should have a }” rope attached to it, 
to hang down for the children to take hold of. Running from the eye of 
this rod to the top of the attachment of the vertical and incline rod at the 
giant stride eye, should be twisted a No. 9 galvanized steel wire, which will 
keep the rod from bending down. In order to keep it from twisting side-
-P-A-G-E-245
246 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
ways, a No. 9 wire should be attached to the point of intersection of the arm 
and the incline rod and then be twisted around each of the other incline 
rods and finally re-attached to the first point of attachment. Then attach 
a No. 9 wire to the eye of the arm, and run it from this eye horizontally 
to each of the incline rods immediately adjoining. If this does not prove 
sufficient bracing wires may be crossed in addition. ‘These wires are not 
shown in drawing. 
Giant Stripe ATTACHMENT. In case it is wished to use these arms 
for giant stride purposes, use instead of the 3” iron rod, pieces of 4” x 14” 
steel tubing, which will be attached as shown in Fig. 5. The end, where 
attached to the vertical rod, should have a 1” pipe thread cut on it and a 1” 
lock nut attached on either side of the vertical rod. A 1” thread should be 
cut on the other end and a 1” malleable cap screwed on. This cap should 
be made as follows: Drill 4” hole through the center, make an eye bolt out 
of 4” iron with an eye 1” in diameter and with a shank about 1}” long, with 
a 4” thread cut the entire length of it. Put a }” nut as far on the shank as 
possible, insert the shank in the hole drilled in the 4” cap and then put the 
other nut on. (Note—When making the eye bolt make a dent on one side 
sufficiently deep to admit the point of a rope hook.) 
For a hanger to attach in this eye, insert 3” rope into rope hook and 
cut off pieces of rope long enough to leave room for a knot about 3’ or 4’ 
above the ground. There should not be more than 8 of these giant stride 
hangers upon the machine. They should be wired on as indicated for the 
iron arm and in addition a No. 9 wire should be twisted into each eye con- 
necting the 3 ends directly. 
FLIPPING MERRY-GO-ROUND 
The most valuable use for a merry-go-round is for the children to 
jump on and off while it is in motion. (“Flipping,” they call it.) This 
prevents them from becoming dizzy and gives them more exercise. In 
order to make this piece into a flipping merry-go-round saw off the foot 
board or never put it on.

the holes in the upright pipe (K) and through the sides of the teeter ladder 
(A) and then the nuts screwed on as shown in Fig. 4. 
SLIDE FOR LIFE ADJUSTMENT 
The “Slide for Life” described and illustrated in Reprint No. 14 is 
attached in the following manner to the teeter ladder frame. The cable (G) 
runs through the casting D, which runs down to the dead man, shown in 
Fig. 7. This dead man has a, hole drilled through it, for a }” x 20” eye bolt. 
The dead man is set in concrete. Cable G runs through this eye bolt and 
is tightened by means of a one ton chain hoist and then kept in place by 
4 or 5 Crosby wire rope clips (F). It is then further tightened by means 
of the lock nuts shown in Fig. 7. 
DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING ALL SEASONS SLIDE 
In the main this slide is made like that described under Reprint No. 9, 
with the exception, however, that it is considerably higher and is made to 
stand up alone. It can be made like the Back Yard Slide or put on top 
of the frame in the same way that the ladders are placed in Reprint No. 14, 
in which case the side of the steps will be attached to the top pipe in the 
same manner as directed for the attachment of teeter boards to frame 
(see Reprint No. 8) with the exception that smaller bolts will be used and 
twice the number of castings will be required. 
The sides of the slide (E) require pieces of kiln dried spruce or Southern 
pine, 2” x 4” x 16’. The sides (G) require pieces of kiln dried spruce or 
Southern pine 2” x 4” x 10’.
-P-A-G-E-248
PLAYCRAFT 249 
The steel is attached to the slide at both top and bottom in a manner 
similar to that directed for the attachment of the top and of the steel under 
Reprint No. 9. 2 pieces of steel 8’ long will be required. 
The guard rail (B) may need another attachment in the shape of a 
vertical rod to run from its center to the side of the slide. The whole 
guard rail should be made of 3” iron, as directed under Reprint No. 9. 
The upright (F) in Fig. 1 requires a piece of kiln dried spruce or South- 
ern pine 2” x 4" x 4’ 2”. The bottom piece (H) requires a piece of kiln dried 
spruce or Southern pine 2” x 4” x 8’. The bottom piece (J) is made of a 
piece of oak or rock maple 3” x 6” x 6’. Sides F and J are braced by means

  of $” iron rods (M) which are welded into eye bolts, which screw into the 
respective timbers. Sides H and J are braced in the same manner. Care 
must be taken to put the eyes into the timbers so that when bolts (C) and 
bolt (I) are removed, pieces H and F can be made to change places so that 
the slide will assume the position shown in Fig. 2, which is for winter use. 
It is necessary to put boards over the top of the steps with cleats on top 
and with cleats on the bottom, which engage the steps and when 2 or 3 
bolts are run through into a piece loosely placed on the under side, the slide 
is in shape for winter use.
-P-A-G-E-249
250 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
The frame shown in Fig. 1 (S), which holds the slide up from the 
ground should have pieces connecting the bottoms of the incline pieces 
which form the sides to keep it from spreading apart. 
(These are not shown in the drawing.) 
We have never made up one of these but think that it offers good 
opportunity for some manual training boy to test his ingenuity.

DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING AND ERECTING “SLIDE FOR LIFE” 
TWO STYLES 
“Sipe For Lirs.” This is a piece of apparatus which we designed in Denver and found to be the most valuable of anything on the playground, far exceeding in usefulness a gymnasium frame and equipment costing upwards of $1,000.00 to install. The “Slide for Life” consists of an incline steel cable about 200’ long, having an attachment at one end to the Combi- nation Swing and Gymnasium Frame directly over the Incline Ladder. The other end of the cable is attached to the Combination Teeter Ladder and Slide Frame, with suitable appurtenances for keeping the cable taut. This cable serves as a runway for traveling apparatus, which consists of a ball bearing wheel, having a galvanized malleable iron ring suspended therefrom.

SLIDE FOR LIFE 
The children climb the Incline Ladder, take hold of this ring, and 
“slide for life.” This piece of apparatus is very popular. 
In Denver, we used this only one hour per day and the children would 
assemble at the grounds for an hour before the time for the slide to be opened 
and stand in line waiting for their turn. We used this piece of apparatus

during the latter part of our stay in Denver, I think, for a period of about 
two months, without a single accident. During the latter part of the run, 
the cable is so near the ground that the children can drop off at any time 
without injury to themselves.

is used on hay carriers and for smoke stack guys. The upper end of this 
cable runs over fitting (IK) shown in Fig. 1 Combination Swings and Gym- 
nasium (Reprint No. 11). From this point it runs down, after being wound 
around the pipe two or three times to fitting (I) where it is wound around 
again and attached to itself by means of several wire rope clips.

DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING AND ERECTING THREE STORY PLAYGROUND 
EQUIPMENT 
Space in the air is cheaper than space on the ground. We have designed 
an equipment, which permits of three sets of children playing above each 
other without going to the expense of building gigantic glass buildings. 
Fig. 1 illustrates the method. Six 8’ swings and two playground slides 
occupy the lower story. Above this is a board platform (P) with a guard 
rail (GR). The children climb up the ladder to the slide, run across the 
platform, and either ascend the vertical ladder (VL) to the third story, 
or take a ride on “The Slide for Life” (SFL) as shown in Fig. 2. Another 
set of larger children can climb up the incline ladder and run across the 
platform on the third story and slide down the sliding poles. Underneath 
this platform on the third story, is placed a steel horizontal ladder HL, 
which is reached from the second story. 
This equipment enables about ninety children to exercise on space very 
little larger than that occupied by an ordinary set of 6 swings. 
We have never made one of these, but cannot see why the idea is not 
entirely practicable. 
Tf any purchaser of this book wishes to make up one of these and test 
it, we will be glad to take the matter up with them and furnish specifications, 
ete. 
The materials for the construction of this frame would cost between 
$100.06 and $200.00.

The materials ¢ quired for each swing are:— 
1 piece first cuality oak tanned leather 3” x 234”, which forms the back 
of the swing. (Fig. 4, Fig. 6.) 
1 piece first quality oak tanned Jeather 5” x 214”, which forms the seat 
of the swing. (Fig. 3, Fig. 6.) 
4 pieces blk. or russet harness leather 2” x 83”, which forms the straps, 
through which the rope runs. (Fig. 5, Fig. 6.)

FIGURE 7—PATTERN FOR WEDGE SCREW 
Upper ends of rope are run into }” *rope hooks, which cost about 15c 
apiece; rope is secured in them by means of wedge screws of the shape 
and size shown in Fig. 7, which is a pattern to be used in making the 
wedge screw as per directions under Reprint No. 6. (Figs. 1 and 2.) 
}” x 14” lag screws are used for making up wedge screw for 4” rope. The 
leather should be thoroughly waterproofed and cut according to drawings. 
The bottom and back of the swings are held in place by No. 7 x }” copper 
rivets and burrs. The straps are attached to the back and bottom by No. 
7 x }” copper rivets and burrs. The straps are attached to the back 
alone by No. 7 x }” copper rivets. See Reprint No. 6 for center swings. 
This swing has been in use in St. Paul for six years. 
DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING INCLINE LADDER OF WOOD 
Wooden ladders are very much cheaper than steel and it may some- 
times be advisable to use them. Fig. 1 shows side view of the ladder; 
Fig. 2, general plan; Fig. 3, section of the side and section of the rung; 
while Fig. 4 shows the method of attachment to the frame. 
Marerrats. Spruce or Southern pine have usually been used for 
this purpose. It should be kiln dried. The rungs should be made

of white oak or hickory. Gal. iron pipe is sometimes also used for the 
rungs. 
The sides of the ladder are attached to the frame by means of 3” iron, 
which is bent around the pipe and screwed into the sides of the ladders as 
shown in Fig. 4. Iron extends in from end of ladder 8”.

APPENDIX 
THE PROPER RELATION OF ORGANIZED SPORTS ON PUB- 
LIC PLAYGROUNDS AND IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS* 
By Mrs. Lorna Hicsrr Letanp 
Secretary, Department of Physical Education, N. E. A., Denver Convention, 
1909 
Sports for public schools and public playgrounds will be influenced 
by the fundamental principles underlying the work of the two institutions. 
Each has a specific mission. 
THE PLAYGROUND STANDS FOR NATURAL EDUCATION, RACIAL EDUCATION, 
SELF EDUCATION 
The playground furnishes practically the only place in the city where 
the chjld is not obliged to do things which are foreign or distasteful to its 
nature. It furnishes the opportunity for the development of the individual 
along racial and primitive lines, which must serve as a foundation for the 
finishing touches of civilization. It enforces the authority of tradition as 
translated by the social consciousness of the children themselves. 
Play is nature’s short cut to experience; it teaches the lessons which 
were beneficial to the race in past ages. The consciousness of the normal 
child at various stages of its growth is the best guide as to the content and 
the manner of applying these lessons. 
‘The play director is the interpreter of race traditions, and has become 
necessary by the conditions of civilization, which have prevented the child 
from observing the activities of adults under favorable conditions and with 
opportunity for imitation. The group consciousness of children runs the 
playground. The play instructor secures his influence from the fact that 
he knows more things which will interest the children than any one of their 
natural street leaders. Knowing these points of contact, he leads the child 
from one stage of primitive thought and action to another and higher stage. 
The child, however, is always the supreme judge of the efficiency of the 
leadership. 
PLAYGROUND ACTIVITIES MUST BE RECREATIVE AND 
INTERESTING 
Playground activities must first of all be interesting; otherwise the 
child will play on the streets or the vacant lot. A system of educational

276 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
play for the playground must be prescribed with absolute freedom for the 
child to choose-just what he will play and what he will not play. The chil- 
dren’s interest, however, cannot always be trusted implicitly. Our system 
of play must be submitted for trial; if accepted, we may be assured it has 
some of the elements required, then its effect upon the children must be 
observed in order to see if the progression is along ethical, educational and 
hygienic lines. 
Whatever the educational, hygienic and sociological ends which the 
public playground has to serve, they must be achieved through the recrea- 
tive application of play. 
THE SCHOOL STANDS FOR THE ACQUIRED EDUCATION OF CIVILIZATION 
The school stands for the education of the present day civilization, and 
the adaptation of the child to this civilization. The school system has been 
developed by adults to meet these requirements as they see them from 
their standpoint. It represents to them the ideals towards which the race 
is consciously working. 
To the child, it represents external authority, along with the teaching 
of parents, of the church and society in general. School is the personifica- 
tion of the “eternal musts.” It is the place to learn to work at disagreeable 
duties. School and work have a distinctive value in the education of the 
child. Everything in life cannot be done in the spirit of play. Groos says, 
“Among primitive races, where the life work js for the most part guided by nature, at least in 
the case of males, boys may get sufficient preparation from play for their later life”... - 
“But with civilized people, usage to earnest, persistent effort, that is not dependent upon 
caprice or impulse, is an indispensable condition for success in the struggle for life, and for 
this reason school life should promote a high sense of duty as opposed to mere inclination.” 
Therefore the teacher is essentially a disciplinarian and often a task mas- 
ter personifying work, necessity and duty. 
THE SCHOO], MUST MEET THE NEEDS OF THE AVERAGE PUPIL 
Since the public school was founded for the purpose of general educa- 
tion, it must meet the needs of the greatest number of pupils. Hence, of 
necessity, the brightest must be kept back in order not to outstrip the dull- 
ards. Necessarily the passing mark is such that every student with proper 
study can reach it. Such methods raise average intelligence, but tend to 
limit individual initiative, which is one of the chief concomitants of civiliza- 
tion. 
THE DISCIPLINE OF SCHOOLS AND PLAYGROUNDS IS ANTIPHETICAL 
The difference between school and playground methods is clearly seen 
in the manner of discipline. At school, if the child does not observe the 
rules, we keep him in longer as punishment. In the playground, if he does 
not observe the rules, which are largely of his own making, we put him off 
the grounds, trusting to be able to make the play so interesting that such 
discipline will be real punishment.

APPENDIX QTT 
SCHOOL SPORTS SHOULD DEVELOP ALL THE CHILDREN 
The lessons of the playground and the school are both necessary; 
whatever use either institution makes of play, it seems best that each should 
follow its own traditions. Therefore, a system of sports for public schools 
should fulfill the following conditions :— 
First. ‘They should be educational, embodying the Pincples which adults find best 
for the children to acquire. They should be fully coordinated with the educational plan. 
Srcoxp. ‘They should be adapted to minister to the hygienic, social and educational 
conditions, which obtain with the majority of the pupils. (The value of exercise as a means 
of physical development is directly rel ated to hygiene and nutrition. Many of our city chil- 
dren are underfed: they suffer from insufficient sleep, unsanitary conditions of living; and 
should they engage in vigorous exercise, not having the necessary food or conditions for creat- 
ing the required energy, the effect would be distinctly harmful and unhygienic. The stimulus 
of intense competition might lead the ambitious, nervous child to greatly exceed the safe 
limitations of his strength.) 
Tarp. They should be compulsory, in order that every child may receive the benefits, 
otherwise the timid child will not participate. They should be a regular part of school work; 
anu the standards should be within the reach of the average child. Specialization and the for- 
mation of permanent teams, therefore, is inadvisable. 
FourtH. They must be adapted to such material conditions of equipment and space as 
obtain in our schools without extensive immediate changes. 
Lasriy. While conforming to all these conditions, they must not lose their identity as 
sports. 
COMPETITION IN SCHOOL SPORTS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT ONLY TO HOLD 
THE INTEREST OF THE CHILDREN 
The games and sports of the school should be in a measure preparatory 
to the freer competitive sports of the playground. The fundamentals of 
the games should be part of the systematic physical education of the schools. 
Informal intra-school contests should be sufficient to hold interest. The 
organization of clubs within the school is apparently the best method. In 
St. Paul, I organized three athletic clubs in one of the schools. Each club 
had a team in each of the branches of sport, basketball, baseball, hockey, 
etc. The total results of the series of games, in which teams of the different 
clubs played each other was made the basis of competition. Perhaps a 
better method would be to have all the games as class work, choosing sides 
each time. Active participation by every pupil and equal development of 
all players should be the ideal of school sports. 
THE PLAYGROUND SHOULD DEVELOP LEADERS 
The development of leaders, however, is a most important part of 
education. Competition is the best method for developing individual effi- 
ciency. he traditions of the playground are such that it furnishes un- 
equalled opportunities for the development of leadership. Leaders can only 
be developed in an atmosphere of liberty. 
The church, the school and the home, since they are enforcing external 
rules are obliged to temper their judgment with mildness accordingly. 
They shield the child from the consequences of his own misdoings. Mater-
-P-A-G-E-277
278 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
nalism develops one side of lifé; when overdone, it creates dependence. 
Critics of the present school system claim that things are made too easy 
for the pupils, that knowledge is fed out to them in homeopathic sugar 
coated doses, and that school life unfits them for the hurly burly of life. 
There is no question but that the playground training is necessary. 
It represents real life standards. In order “to make the team,” it is neces- 
sary to “deliver the goods.” If little Johnnie “muffs a pop up.” his peers 
sit in judgment and the jury of equals do not listen to the plea that “he did 
his best.” The verdict is “go play with the kids!” “Give him the sack 
off the team!” There is no 65% passing mark on the playground. 
One of the hardest tasks the adult has, is to understand and influence 
childhood. Through the natural street leaders of the children, who can be 
influenced through the sports of the playground, the great body of the chil- 
dren can be reached. 
INTER-SCHOOL COMPETITION CAN BE CARRIED ON BEST THROUGH THE CO- 
OPERATION OF THE PUBLIC PLAYGROUNDS 
Competition between schools can best be carried on with the codpera- 
tion of the public playgrounds, under the joint control of that organization, 
of the public schools, of the private and parochial schools. ‘These play- 
ground school sports should furnish the opportunity for the development 
of the individual through competition, which the limitations of the school 
prohibit. The organized sports of the school should furnish training for 
the playground sports, and only those who measure up to certain standards 
both physical and mental should be allowed to enter the inter-school games. 
For example, suppose thirty-two pupils pass in playground ball and in their 
studies. These pupils would be the playground ball squad to represent their 
school in competition. First, second and third teams would be chosen, 
who would compete with the first, second and third teams of another play 
ground. The total playground ball score would be the combined scores of 
all the teams. 
Other sports should be conducted in a similar manner. ‘hose schools 
located near a playground would use it as a place for playing off district 
games. The championship meet should be a great occasion, possibly a 
Fourth of July Festival participated in by the whole city. The prizes should 
be inexpensive, such as ribbons and banners and should go to the team, 
school and playground rather than to individuals. 
  PHYSICAL TRAINING AND MANUAL TRAINING SHOULD BE CORRELATED 
THROUGH CONSTRUCTIVE: PLAY 
The child’s instinct for play should not be satisfied with ready made 
toys. Children should work for their play, to derive educational benefit. 
The official “bats, balls” and other equipment used for school and play- 
ground games should be “child made,” the champions those who make 
the best goods and play the best game. Playground and school sports can
-P-A-G-E-278

direct the dynamie stream of play into the channels of “ playcraft,” where its Sorce can become accustomed to industrial uses. If money is spent on materi- als and instructors to teach the children to make their own play supplies, some temptations would be removed from politicians and others who are not in business for their health. 
Such correlation through play of physical and educational forces would be of mutual uplift and would remedy many of the evils toward which un- 
correlated athletics inevitably lead. 
THE DANGERS OF COMPETITION 
Competition unless carefully regulated tends to specialization. Special- 
ization creates conditions favorable for commercialism. Commercialism 
is at the bottom of corruption in athletics. 
When a sport becomes so interesting that the public prefers to sit on 
the benches and watch rather than to play, it ceases to be a sport and be- 
comes an art, consequently it can have little influence as a means of general 
physical education. Sports in England are developed by the amateur and 
for the amateur. Consequently every one plays; fathers play with their 
sons. Sports in America are developed by the professional for the profes- 
sional, for the purpose of making money, consequently if any one keeps 
up with the rapid specialization of the games, it is almost impossible to 
have any other business in life. 
When the innocent little game of town ball was taken and developed 
as a spectacular art, great harm was done to the sport of our country. 
College, High School and Athletic Club sports are professional in methods 
and ideals, because they are intended mainly to interest the spectator and 
not for the benefit of the player. : 
The American trait of specialization is partly responsible for this and 
it has been helped along wonderfully by commercial interests, which have 
taken advantage of American opportunities in a characteristic American 
way. Professional athletics, if they have a place, should not set the stand- 
ards for amateur athletics, nor for the sports of schools and playgrounds. 
The playing rules for professionals and amateurs should be upon an en- 
Hrely different basis. ‘The educators of our country can absolutely change 
the tendency of our national games by concerted action. The remedy lies 
with the rules and with the rules committee, which determine whether the 
game shall tend towards specialization or not. ; 
Rules committees have generally been made up of professional coaches 
and others, who judging from results have been interested largely in the 
money side of the game. Naturally such rules committees have emphasizec 
the possibilities of the games as money makers. sionals 
Nominal clean sport campaigns may be all right among professionals. 
but for amateurs, reform should strike at the roots of evil by modify ng t le 
conditions which cause corruption, rather than by treating BAA 
with the antidotes of registration of teams, who must use “ official halls,  
-P-A-G-E-279
280 PLAYGROUND TECHNIQUE AND PLAYCRAFT 
etc., the proceeds from the sale of which pays the expense of white- 
washing. 
Children, who have not been subjected to corrupting influences, natur- 
ally love fair play. They play the game for the game’s sake. Most unsports- 
manlike tricks are learned from coaches and others. 
EDUCATORS SHOULD PREPARE AND PUBLISH MODIFIED RULES TO DEVELOP 
CHILDREN’S SPORTS WITH AMATEUR IDEALS 
The control of rules committees, modifications and publication of 
rules, governing the sports of schools and playgrounds should be in the 
hands of educators, physical educators, hygienists and others, who are not 
dependent upon commercial interests in securing and holding their positions. 
Such a rules committee should modify our traditional games to adopt them 
to city, school and playground conditions and should publish these modified 
rules and keep control of the situation rather than permit the publication 
and control to be taken up by the same interests which have done so much 
to specialize American games. 
When the children’s games of our country follow in the commercial 
and professional footsteps of the games for adults, as now played, then 
amateur sport in America will indeed be dead.

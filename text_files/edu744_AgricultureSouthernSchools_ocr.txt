PREFACE 
Tus little book has been written with the hope of 
supplying the need for an elementary text-book on agrti- 
culture that shall differ from others in having a definite 
and limited field,—the South. While many of the prin- 
ciples of agriculture are universal, the application of these 
principles is somewhat local. By limiting the field of a 
text-book on agriculture to the Southern states, it becomes 
possible to treat the subject in a concrete way; to avoid 
many generalities inseparable from a book intended for 
use in all latitudes; and to employ as object-lessons unly 
those plants that any teacher or pupil in a Southern school 
can easily obtain. For example, it is better that a South- 
ern pupil study the peach bloom fresh from the tree than 
to read of the flower of some plant rarely found in the 
orchards or fields in this latitude. The cotton bloom, too, 
affords a suitable example of how flowers are constructed. 
This. Southern point of view also makes it possible to give 
fuller, and hence more teachable, treatment to the most 
widely grown crops of the South. 
The principal aims that have guided the author in writ- 
ing this book are these : — 
1. To arouse the interest of the pupil in nature, and 
especially in the common plants of the Southern farm, 
orchard, and garden.

-P-A-G-E-4
iv PREFACE 
2. So to present the subject that it may be mastered 
rather by stimulated observation and quickened thought 
than by mere memorizing. 
3. To make a teachable book, — one that will present 
fewest possible difficulties to a teacher who has had no 
special training in either the theory or practice of agri- 
culture. The effort has been made to lead the pupil by 
easy steps from the known to the less familiar subjects, 
and from the concrete example to the general law or 
principle. 
4. To make the language simple enough to be readily 
understood by a pupil in the sixth grade of the common 
schools, and yet to present the subject with enough system 
and substance to suit the pupils in the high school. 
5. To emphasize, amplify, and illustrate a few princi- 
ples, which, when understood and practiced, have the 
power to revolutionize Southern farm practice and to 
promote the permanent prosperity of the farmer and of 
the state. 
The author’s experience as a teacher, his long study 
and practice of agriculture, and his association with chil- 
dren, lead him to think that all these aims can be real- 
ized. He must leave to his fellow-teachers of the South 
the verdict whether this book approaches his cherished 
ideals, 
Recognizing the fact that provision has not been made 
for the special instruction of teachers in agriculture and 
that many are not familiar with farm practice, he adds 
this message to all such teachers. You can teach this 
subject effectively even without this acquaintance with

farm work. Your weakness will become your greatest 
strength if it cause you to step down in this class from 
the teacher’s desk and to be a comrade with your pupils, 
—a fellow-seeker after the truth that none of us can 
know completely. Be a leader in raising questions which 
you need not be ashamed to own that you cannot answer. 
If you arouse the interest that will make your pupils desire 
an answer, you arouse in them for the years to come the 
spirit of inquiry by means of which, as men and women, 
they will educate themselves. In teaching agriculture, 
humility is the teacher’s proper attitude, and to show it will 
not forfeit the respect of either pupils or patrons.

AGRICULTURE FOR SOUTHERN 
SCHOOLS 
SECTION I. INTRODUCTION 
We all enjoy a trip to a part of the country in which 
we have never been. It is the newness of all we see

things about the very places where we live, and so find 
the same interest and pleasure that a trip affords us? 
Some persons have learned to do this. They make dis- 
coveries on any day that they spend in the woods or fields. 
They find flowers that they have not noticed before; 
they learn which wild plants and weeds are kin to useful 
plants that they know; they observe how plants provide 
for their seed to be carried by wind, or water, or birds, or 
by large animals to other parts of the field or pasture. 
They learn new facts about animals and brooks and the 
whole out-of-doors. If we try to observe the plants that 
g¢ow in our woods, or field, or garden, or orchard, we shall 
always be making interesting discoveries and gaining new 
plant friends. 
There is not only delight in collecting the wild flowers 
and in observing the trees, but there is also pleasure and 
profit in learning the nature and habits of our cultivated 
plants. We will know better how to prune a peach 
tree, an apple treé, or a grape-vine if we observe whether 
the fruit is borne on new branches or on those one or 
two years old. Notice this and tell the teacher what you 
observe. We shall be able to select better seed corn if we 
learn which shape of ear or of kernel is found in the most 
productive varieties. Agriculture deals with such ques- 
tions as these. 
A study of agriculture should enable pupils to under- 
stand better the common plants and animals of the farm 
and cause them to take more interest in them. A book like 
this can give only a few of the most important principles 
of plant and animal growth. A knowledge of these

the best way to select, feed, and cultivate plants and to

care for animals so that farming may be made more inter- 
esting and more profitable.

  4 AGRICULTURE 
Agriculture is the practice of producing useful plants 
and animals. It is based on physiology, botany, chemis- 
try, and other natural sciences. It is also an art because 
success in agriculture requires skill and experience and 
business methods. In agricultural books, papers, and 
pamphlets is recorded much of the experience of the best 
farmers. In studying agriculture we shall learn some- 
thing about flowers, fruits, vegetables, and animals, as 
well as about crops that grow in the fields. 
Reasons for studying agriculture. — Agriculture is 
worthy of our most earnest study. It is the industry that 
furnishes food to all mankind and on which many arts and 
industries are built. Its study teaches us how plants feed, 
grow, and multiply; how man may take common plants 
and greatly increase their productiveness, beauty, or hardi- 
ness; how he may rear animals; how a farmer may make 
his poor soil rich, his scant crops bountiful, and his life 
and the life of his family full of comfort and pleasure. 
Surely, it is worthwhile to learn how to make the crops 
Jarger, tre farm animals more useful and profitable; how 
to make the garden and orchard yield a continuous supply 
of vegetables and fruits; and how to beautify the grounds 
around the home and the school. 
It is worth while, too, for all of us to know how to pro- 
tect our plants from disease and how to conquer our insect 
foes. If blights, smuts, and mildews destroy the crops 
of field, orchard, or garden, knowledge suggests ways of 
preventing or destroying them. If caterpillars, bugs, 
weevils, and a host of other insect pests strip bare the 
growing crops and despoil the stored grain, knowledge
-P-A-G-E-15
INTRODUCTION 5 
of their lives and habits is. the weapon with which man 
conquers them. : 
Wherever farming has proved to be profitable, we may 
expect to find good roads, good schools, churches, libraries, 
telephones, and much else that helps to make life in the 
country pleasant and attractive. Even a child may do his 
part in bringing these things to pass. Some of the agri-

culture that he learns at school he can promptly make 
use of at home. Still more of it will be helpful to him in 
jater years if he becomes a farmer. Best of all, the study 
of agriculture should enable him to find a keener pleasure in 
observing the ways of plants and animals, and thus enrich 
his entire life, whatever may be his future occupation. 
Even from this book we may learn how to make the soil 
richer year by year. If we should remember only this, 
and forget all else, we should be able to help our neighbor- 
hood and our country as well as ourselves. He serves his

‘into a fertile and wealth-producing farm. He serves it also 
who aids in introducing a better class of live-stock or in 
producing better milk and butter. . 
EXERCISE. — Secure a small notebook with a back that will not easily 
break. Tie to ita pencil. Use this for your agricultural exercises, and 
for no other purpose. Before the end of the session this little note- 
book will be more interesting to you than any printed book, —and you 
will be an author. - 
As you study this chapter, write in your notebook a numbered list of 
the plants you know. Write down the names of all the field crops 
cultivated near your home. Opposite each write all of its uses. Like- 
wise write a list of the names and uses of as many kinds as you can of 
farm animals and poultry. 
Note To THE TEACHER. — Question pupils on the text of every 
chapter. Encourage answers in the language of the child rather 
than in the exact language of the book. Grade pupils as much on the 
_ exercises at the end of each chapter, and on independent observation, as 
on the text. By grades or other means stimulate the pupils to bring to 
the class in agriculture object lessons appropriate to the subject in hand. 
Require notebooks and examine these often. You will be helped in 
teaching agriculture by having at hand “ Exercises in Elementary Agri- 
culture ; Plant Production,” by Dick J. Crosby. This bulletin is sent

  SECTION Ul. THE PARTS *OF THE FLOWER: 
PLANT FAMILIES 
‘ue chief effort of the plant is to produce seed. A 
flower must be formed before the seed can be produced. 
Its beautiful colors, its nectar, and its delicious perfume 
are means to attract insects whose help it may require in 
making seed. 
Mustard flower. — As our first example, we may inquire © 
what are the parts of a mustard flower (Fig. 4). In the 
  Fic. 4. — FLower oF Fic. 5. — DETAILS OF PART 
MustarD or Mustarp FLOWER 
center of this flower is a column, at the top of which is a 
rounded knob (0, Fig. 5). The whole central column is 
called the fzsti/. Its important parts are the ovule case, 
near the base, in which the seeds develop; and the stigma, 
or knob at the top. In some plants the stigma is divided 
into several parts. The surface of a full-grown stigma is 
sticky or rough, so that pollen, which is the yellow dust 
of the flower, may stick to it. The ovule case, or ovary, 
e 
rh 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  $s AGRICULTURE 
contains little, immature, seed-like bodies, called ovules, 
Each ovule may become a seed. But before an ovule can 
change into a seed, it must be fertilized; 
that is, a grain of pollen must fall upon 
the stigma and grow down into the ovule, 
after which the latter becomes a seed. 
In a circle just outside of the pistil are a 
number of slender stalks (six on the mustard 
flower) called the stamens (1, 4, Fig. 5). The 
most important part of a stamen is the cap 
at the top. This is the anther, or pollen 
case. When the anther is mature, it bursts 
and frees a yellow powder, called pollen. ; 
Soon after this powder or pollen is shed, 
the stamen, now useless, dies. The pollen must be carried 
by insects or wind or otherwise to the sticky or rough 
surface of the stigma in the same or in a different flower. 
If pollen is not brought to the stigma, no seeds develop. 
In a layer just outside of the stamens is the bright- 
colored part of the flower (2, Fig. 5). This is called the 
corolla. In many plants, as in the mustard, it is divided 
into a number of distinct pieces, each being really a colored 
leaf, called a petal. Fig. 4 shows that there are four petals 
in the mustard flower. In a layer just outside of these 
are the green parts of the flower, called sepals (3, Fig. 5). 
Let us see whether most flowers have their parts arranged 
in the same order, the pistil in the center, the stamens around 
the pistil, the petals next to these, and outside of all, the 
sepals. 
Peach blossom.— The peach blossom has this same Stigma

arrangement (Fig. 7). It has one undivided pistil. This 
is the part that a fruit grower examines after a frost, for 
he knows that if the pistils are 
killed there will be no peaches. 
Notice that there are numerous 
stamens; that there are five 
petals; and that there are five 
sepals, grown together. 
Apple blossom. — The apple 
blossom (Fig. 8) is very much 
like that of the peach, but its 
pistil is divided into five parts. 
' Like the peach it has five 
petals and five sepals. 
In all the examples given 
above, there has been the same 
number of petals as of sepals. 
This is often true. 
Cotton flower.—The cotton 
bloom is formed on the plan 
of fives (Fig. 9). There are 
five showy petals, and also five short sepals. These last 
are grown together and 
form a shallow cup, 
which incloses the base 
of the boll. The three 
large green parts that 
form the square are not 
sepals, but dracts, or 
leaf-like extra parts. You also find bracts around some     ‘Photo by 8. 8. Mackintosh 
ic. 7.— Pear Biooms 
  Tic. 8.— FLOWERS OF THE APPLE 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
  10 AGRICULTURE 
other flowers, for example, around the strawberry blossom 
and the head of the sunflower. 
There are usually four or five divisions of the pistil in 
the cotton bloom. From the number of these you will 
find that you can foretell how 
many locks of cotton there will 
be in any boll; for there will 
be just as many locks in the 
boll as there are divisions of 
the pistil. 
The stamens in the cotton 
bloom are numerous. Their 
  lower parts or stalks grow 
together to form a tube sur- 
rounding the pistil. 
Plant families. — Plants that produce blooms are divided 
‘into more than two hundred families. A family of plants 
generally includes the kinds that form their flowers in the 
same general way. For example, the Bean family in- 
cludes the garden pea, the sweet-pea, the field or cowpea, 
the locust tree, ail kinds of clovers, and many others. If 
you will pick from a clover head a single tiny flower, Fic. 9. —SrEcticn or Cotton 
Broom 
yeu will see that its parts have the same general shape 
and arrangement as the large flowers of the garden pea, of 
the cowpea, or of the beautiful sweet-pea. 
Perhaps you can find out what resemblances there are 
between the flowers of the blackberry, the strawberry, the 
apple, the pear, the peach, the plum, and the wild rose. 
These ali belong to the very large Rose family, which 
includes most of our fruits and berries,

THE PARTS OF THE FLOWER Ir 
It will be easy for you to find scores of plants that be- 
long to the immense family of the 
Grasses. After carefully examining 
several well-known grasses, like crab 
grass, examine plants of corn and oats 
and see how many resemblances to 
grasses you find in these useful crop 
plants. These and other grains are 
grasses (Fig. 10). cs Wy 
EXERCISE.—In every large flower you 
find, point out (1) the pistil, (2) the stamens, 
(3) the petals, and (4) the sepals. Find the 
pollen in all the flowers you examine. Does 
it show in young flower-buds ? Why is there 
little or no pollen in flowers that are nearly 
ready to wither or drop? 
Collect all the cultivated and wild plants 
that you can find having blossoms shaped xe 
those of the sweet-pea or bean. In your BGlet tia cto Onn Brawn

you have ever heard called a clover to see whether its separate 
blossoms have the shape of a pea or sweet-pea bloom. 
Note TO THE TEACHER.— Devote as much time as possible to 
having pupils point out the parts of each flower that may be brought to 
the class. Have them place in separate piles (1) all the pea-like 
flowers, (2) all the flowers that seem to them kin to the roses and 
blackberries, and (3) all the grasses. Probably one or two reviews 
of this chapter must be given so as to afford time for examination of 
every flower that is brought in.    
 
-P-A-G-E-22
SECTION III. POLLINATION 
WuILE you have been learning the names of the differ- 
ent parts of the flowers, you have perhaps been thinking 
about the uses of each part. The sepals and petals serve 
to protect the more important parts inside. For example, 
the peach sepals and petals while still folded together in 
the bud keep the pistil from being killed by slight frosts 
in the early spring; thus the peach crop is sometimes 
saved. That the stamens and pistils, however, are more 
important than the sepals and petals can be proved by care- 
fully removing all of the petals from a flower of cotton 
or from a peach blossom. In spite of this injury, a boll 
or a peach will form if pollen is applied to the stigma. 
Flowers without petals. — Since the flower makes seed 
or fruit by means of the stamens and pistil alone, these 
two parts are called the necessary or essential parts. 
The flowers of many plants have no showy sepals and 
petals. The sepals and the petals are not strictly 
necessary. When you see the flowers of corn and wheat 
you may not think of them as flowers, because they have 
no gay colors. The bees and other insects do not often 
visit such flowers. : ‘ 
Function or use of the pistil.— The pistil is the part of 
@ flower that develops into the seed-case or fruit. In its 
12

  iS 
base it contains the tiny ovules which may develop into 
seeds. There will be no fruit or seed formed if the pistil 
is destroyed. 
Function or use of pollen. —.The part of the stamen that 
is most important is the pollen or plant 
dust. This is a fine powder and is set 
free by the opening of the little pollen 
“case, or anther, at the tip end of the 
stamen, Pollen must adhere to .and

FLOWER grow into the pistil 
and enter the ovule be- 
fore seed contained in 
the pistil can develop. 
You may learn the im- 
portance of the pollen 
to the plant by carefully 
picking off all the sta- 
mens of a nearly open flower bud of cotton 
or peach or other plant. Then tie a small 
paper sack over the injured bloom to keep 
the pollen of other flowers from being 
brought in by wind or insects. In a few 
days you will find that the pistil to which 
no pollen can gain access does not grow, 
but generally dies and falls. If it lives 
it produces no perfect seed. At the same 
time, other pistils, on whose stigmas you 
have noticed tiny grains adhering, will 
be growing (Figs. 12, 13, 14).

If you tie a paper bag tightly over a young corn ear

before the silks show, and keep it there, no grains will 
form on that cob. This is because no pollen falls on the 
silks, which are the pistils of an ear of corn. For the 
same reason, if you cut the young silks from one side of 
an ear shoot, no grains will grow on that side. Every silk 
is connected with a grain space on the cob, and if that silk

catches no pollen, a vacant grain space is left on the cob 
where this silk arises? 
Pollen does not cause fruit or seed to grow or be pro- 
duced unless the plant that bore it is of the same kind 
as, or closely related to, the plant on whose pistil it is placed. 
Thus peach pollen is useless on apple blossoms. The pol- 
len may come from the same flower of which the pistil is 
a part, from another flower of the same plant, or from a 
different plant.
-P-A-G-E-25
POLLINATION 15 
‘Self-pollinated plants.—In the flowers of wheat, oats, 
and peas, the pistil is usually pollinated by the pollen that 
is produced in the same flower. Such plants are said to 
be self-pollinated. Self-pollinated plants do not mix with 
other kinds in the field. 
Cross pollinated plants. — On the other hand, the pistils 
of some kinds of plants generally receive pollen t!.at grows 
on a different plant. Such plants are said to be cross- 
pollinated. If a farmer grows a white and -a yellow 
variety of corn side by side, these will be mixed in a few 
years. This is because the light pollen dust from one 
kind is carried by the wind to the silks of the other kind. 
Many a boy has had his patch of popcorn ruined by 
planting it near field corn that bloomed at the same time 
as the popcorn. You have perhaps noticed the pollen of 
corn as it was carried by the wind, like fine dust. You 
have probably also noticed in the spring clouds of yellow- 
ish dust blown from the pine trees. This dust is light 
pollen carried by the wind. 
How insects help the flowers to form sced. — Some plants 
have heavy pollen, which the wind cannot so easily carry. 
Cotton is one of these. Such plants generally have gayly 
colored petals that iat the insects. Even children 
like to taste nectar by to uching the tongue to a blossom of 
honeysuckle after its petals are removed. The flower of- 
fers nectar to insects and in return the insects usually 
bring pollen from a blossom of the same kind and place 
this on the pistil. If we notice a bee as it enters a flower, 
we observe that much yellow dust adheres to its body. 
This is pollen that it rubs against while visiting other 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  
16 AGRICULTURE 
flowers. While it is in the blossoms, it usually happens 
to brush against the sticky or rough stigma, which catches 
some of the pollen it brings. It is interesting to watch 
the movements of the insects when they are thus helping 
the flower to form seed. 
Gardeners who grow tomatoes in the greenhouse col- 
lect the pollen and place it on the flowers by using a brush 
(Fig. 15). If they fail to do so, they get very few

  The two on the right grew from pistils abundantly supplied with pollen; the two 
on the left from pistils receiving but little pollen, 
tomatoes. If there were many large insects in the green- 
house, they might not need to take this trouble. We do 
not need to practice this hand pollination when tomatoes 
are grown in the garden, for then insects might do this 
useful work instead of human hands. 
In one locality the fruit-growers thought that bees were 
injuring their ripe fruits, and accordingly made the keepers 
of bees remove their hives. As a result, the fruit crop de- 
creased. Then the bees were brought back, and the crop 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
POLLINATION 17 
at once increased. If the weather, when fruit trees are in 
bloom, is so cold or rainy that the bees do not fly from 
flower to flower, the crop of fruits is usually small. 
Cross-pollinated plants (those that need to get pollen 
from other plants of the same kind) can be divided into 
two classes, first, those whose pollen is carried from one 
plant to another by wind; second, those whose pollen is 
carried by insects. 
Why strawberries sometimes fail to bear.— A gardener 
once had a well-worked strawberry bed that showed a 
mass of leaves and runners, but yielded 
few berries. This was because he had 
planted only one variety, and that one 
variety did not have well-developed 
stamens. His patch of strawberries 
would have borne good crops if he had Bish gene 
planted every fourth row with another or Srrawserry 
variety having stamens as well as pistils. Te ee 
From this you see it pays to know some- 
thing about how plants are supplied with pollen. Imper- 
fect varieties of strawberries are called pisti//ate varieties, 
because they have pistils only, and the perfect kinds are 
called staminate or perfect varieties, because they have 
stamens as well as pistils (Fig. 16). 
Why the fruit crop sometimes fails.—-Even when the 
flowers contain both stamens and pistils, there is often a 
failure to produce fruit. This is likely to happen when a 
single variety of grapes, pears, or apples is planted alone 
and away from all other varieties of the same fruit. 
Some varieties of these fruits must get pollen that has 
     
-P-A-G-E-28

grown on a different variety. The pollen of a Duchess 
pear, for example, when it falls on the pistils of a Bart-

lett pear tree will cause fruit to grow; but generally no

on the pistils of another Duchess tree. Trees or grape- 
vines that act thus are said to have pollen that is impo- 
tent (powerless) on blossoms of the same variety. Im-

  POLLINATION 19 
potent pollen is one of nature’s many ways of preventing 
self-pollination (Figs. 17 and 18). 
In planting an orchard or vineyard for home use it is 
a good rule to plant several varieties of apples, several 
of pears, and several of grapes, so that one variety may 
supply pollen for the blossoms of the others. 
Pistils and stamens in different parts of the same plants. 
—We have called the pistils and the stamens the essential 
parts of a flower because both are necessary to the forma- 
tion of the seeds. When one flower bears both stamers 
and pistil, it is called a perfect flower.. But the pistil 
and the stamens are not always found in the same flower. 
In the corn plant, for example, the silks are the pistils, 
while the stamens from which comes the pollen are found 
in the tassel, another part of the same plant. Thus you 
see that in corn the 
staminate flowers are 
borne on the top of the 
plant and the pistillate 
on the young ears of 
corn growing on the 
stalks of the same plant. 
On a squash, cucum- 
ber (Fig. 19), or water- 
melon the _ pistillate 
blossom may be known by the little squash or melon which 
shows below its yellow petals. These blossoms have pistils 
but no stamens. In other parts of the same plants are 
staminate blossoms, that have stamens, but no pistils and 
no swollen part. Among other plants having stamens

and pistils borne on the same plant, but not in the same 
flower, are the castor bean, the oak, and the pecan. 
Pistils and stamens are sometimes on different plants. — 
This is the case with hemp, willows, and poplars. 
EXERCISE. — Tie paper bags or pieces of tough paper snugly around 
the unopened buds of any kind of plants that may be blooming when 
you study this lesson. In a week notice whether the pistil is growing 
and seeds are forming If so, these plants do not need visits from 
insects, but are self-pollinated. Notice what flowers are being visited 
by insects and especially by honey bees. Notice the kind of insect. 
Watch them to learn whether they brush off any pollen of another 
flower against the pistil. z 
NoTE TO THE TEACHER. —If a catalogue of some nursery company 
can be had, examine its list of strawberries and by questioning the 
pupils Jearn which of these varieties are grown near the school. Have 
they fruited well? If not, are they marked in the catalogue as pistil- 
late varieties? Blooms of pumpkins or of any kind of melon make a 
good subject for examination and discussion in this lesson. The 
questioning on all lessons should be more to encourage observation and 
understanding than to measure memory work.

SECTION IV. GERMINATION OF SEEDS 
Tue seeds have been called the children of the plant. 
The parent plant provides the seeds with food enough to 
serve them until the young plants have formed roots and 
leaves with which to gather their own food. 
Food for the young plant. — Let us examine a grain of 
corn to see how the plant packs up the good things for its 
seed children. Soak a few dozen grains of corn in water 
over night so that for to-morrow’s 
lesson you may be better able to sepa- 
rate their parts. Outside is the tough 
coat, which you will remove from the 
soaked kernels. With a sharp knife 
you will cut crosswise through a dry Fis. 21.—Cross-secrion i i : THROUGH A Corn KER- 
or soaked kernel, with its groove side yy,

next to the groove and near the tip of 
  the kernel; second, a layer of soft white starch; ‘ind’ 
third, a harder whitish layer, also made up chiefly of 
starch. 
The germ is the only part of the grain that sprouts. It 
may be called the baby plant. The two layers of starch 
and other materials are placed near at hand only to sup- 
ply the germ with food when it first wakes to begin its

growth. If it is not too cold, plant several dozen grains 
of corn either in the ground or in a little box inside a

  window (Fig. 22). Dig up a few of these every day to 
learn how the young plavt grows. j 
Roots grow near the tip end. — The sprouting of seeds is 
called germination. When you dig up seeds that have 
begun to sprout, you find that a little root has started 
. downward, and that a little shoot has grown upward to 
make the above-ground part of the plant. ; 
EXPERIMENT. —Each day the root and shoot become longer. 
Find whether the root grows only near the tip, or whether all parts 
of it lengthen. To learn this, make two marks with India or draw- 
ing ink or other “fast” color on a white root that is about an inch 
oran inch and a half long. Laya ruler by the side of the root and make 
the first mark a quarter of an inch from the tip of the root; make the 
other mark half an inch nearer the grain. A black thread may be tied
-P-A-G-E-33
GERMINATION OF SEEDS 23 
around the root as a marker instead of using drawing ink. Keep the 
sprouted grain moist Ly placing it in damp sand or between moist 
blotting papers kept either in a small tight box or between two saucers. 
After a day or two measure the distance between the two marks, which 
you will find to be unchanged. Now measure from the outer mark to 
the tip of the root and you will find that this portion has grown 
rapidly. 
Roots of all plants increase in length only near the tips. 
However, if you make measurements of the stems of young 
plants, you will find that all parts of the young stem, as 
well as the tip, increase in length until a certain age is 
reached. 
Moisture necessary to make seed sprout. — Did anybody 
in this class ever plant seed when the ground was dry and 
when no rain fell soon afterwards? Did any seed come 
up? Youcan prove that seeds need moisture in order to 
germinate, by planting some seeds in two tomato cans in 
the window; keep the soil in one can very dry and in the 
other barely moist. What happens? 
Heat required for germination.— Oats that were sown 
during very cold weather have sometimes remained un- 
sprouted for a month. When the sowing was done in 
warmer weather, they came up in about one third of that 
time. Seeds of different plants require very different 
amounts of heat to wake them and make them sprout or 
germinate. Seeds of wheat, oats, rye, and barley germinate 
when the soil is quite cool, and so the farmer sows these 
crops during the colder part of the year. Corn grains 
require more heat than oats, but less than the seeds of 
cotton, cowpeas, or peanuts. A farmer never plants these 
last crops until the soil has become somewhat warm. 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
    24 AGRICULTURE 
Sprouting seeds need air. -—- Corn planted in a field that 
was afterwards overflowed by a creek for several days 
failed to come up. It was because the water kept the air 
away from the seeds. 
Three conditions for germination. — We now understand 
that for a seed to germinate it must have mozsture, air, 
and the proper amount of heat. 
How food is stored for the young bean. — You may soak 
or plant peanuts, beans, or cowpeas to learn another way 
in which parents pack plant-food for the use of the infant 
plants. By, carefully removing the seed-coat from the 
soaked seed you find that all the seeds are made up chiefly 
of two thick “ halves,” which later will become the seed- 
leaves, or first pair of leaves. These “halves” are storage 
places or pantries for the food hidden away by the parent 
plant for its seed-children while too young to get food from 
the soil and the air. Mankind’s supply of bread comes 
chiefly from tiny pantries stored in the seeds by grain 
plants. By carefully opening the halves of the seed of 
bean or cowpea, you will find the germ, which appears as 
a very small, flattened, white bud near the point where 
the two fleshy halves are joined together. 
‘*Coming up.’? — When germination occurs, this bud of 
the bean, squash, and many other plants is pulled to the 
surface of the ground in an interesting way. That part of 
the ‘stem just below the seed-leaves rapidly increases in 
length, humping itself into the shape of a wire staple. 
Hence the first thing seen above ground is a part of the 
stem shaped like the center of a wire staple. One end of 
this staple is formed by the roots, while the other end 
‘ O- i
-P-A-G-E-35
GERMINATION OF SEEDS 25 
bears the seed-leaves, which are still imprisoned in the old 
seed-coat underground. However, the stem is steadily 
pulling this end out of the old seed-coat, 
and by a backing process it soon brings 
above ground both the fleshy seed-Icaves | 
and the tiny bud nestling between them. / 
The seed-coat may have been left in the

still imprisoning the bud. Now the ES 
stem lifts its head, straightens its back, Our OF 
and if the seed-coat adheres, pushes it aes 
off by the growth of the bud. 
On the other hand, the garden or 
English pea keeps its two seed-leaves underground 
(Fig. 25), because the part of its stem that grows rapidly is 
the part above the seed-leaves and between them and the 
bud. The young pea stem also humps i:s back and pulls its 
real leaves out of the soil backward. 
The seed-leaves of all these plants, whether coming 
above ground like those of beans, cowpeas, squash, and 
cotton, or remaining in the soil, serve to feed the young 
plant before its own roots and leaves can support it. 
At first these seed-leaves are thick, but as the food in 
these pantries is given to the growing plant, the seed- 
leaves shrivel and finally disappear. Since these seed- 
leaves have to do a very different work from that done 
by the later or true leaves, they naturally look very 
different. 
Large seeds. — The largest seeds usually make a quicker, 
stronger growth and a larger yield than small or light 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  
  26 AGRICULTURE 
seeds. It is best, therefore, to separate the largest seeds 
from the others by using sieves or screens. 
Testing the germination of seeds.— Seeds of some 
plants lose the power to germinate after they are a year or 
two old; »thers are good when a number of years old. 
If seeds become moist and go through a “heat,” they 
lose their power to germinate. Children can often help 
their parents by testing the field or 
garden seeds they expect to plant in 
order to discover what percentage of 
them can grow. All that is needed 
is a plate; a piece of thick, clean, 
dark cloth, to be dampened and 
Fic. 24.—A Home-mave spread on the plate; a similar piece 
aoe to be dampened and used as a cover 
for the seeds; and a second plate to place over it all 
(Fig. 24). Keep this home-made seed tester in a warm 
room. Examine the seed on the fifth and eighth days, and 
as much oftener as you wish. 
    EXERCISE. — With a sharp knife, cut through grains of corn that are 
soft and dented and through others that are flinty and not dented. 
Make a drawing to show the difference between the two grains in the 
thickness of the several layers. Select six grains of corn having the 
largest possible germs, as shown by the size of the depressed area. 
Select six others with the smallest possible germs. Which grains 
would you expect to make the largest, strongest young plants and to 
be best able to push up if covered rather deep ? 
Shell ten yood ears and measure the shelled corn, so as to calculate 
how many ears make a bushel (56 Ib. of shelled corn). Write in your 
notebook the number of ears per bushel. 
A good exercise is to go to a number of cornfields and estimate how 
many bushels. per acre each field will yield. If you can get permission,

gather the corn from a carefully measured area (at least ,'5 acre). 
First weigh the ear corn and then compare your estimates with the 
actual yields. Be sure to record your estimates in your notebook, where 
you can later write the actual yields. 
Note TO THE TEACHER. — Have the pupils make a home-made 
seed tester by following the Cirections in the text or by dampening 
many folds of old newspapers kept in a small tight box. In it let them 
place fifty or one hundred seeds of as many kinds as they can find near 
home. Let them pick out the largest and smallest seeds of wheat, 
radish, or peas. Place both sizes in different parts of the germinating 
box or plate and notice which produces the largest shoots. The in- 
terest of parents may be enlisted by having the pupils make tests to 
determine the percentage of germination of the seeds of vegetables or 
field crops that their parents expect to plant.

SECTION V. WATER FOR THE PLANT \ ~ ‘ 
In order that plants may grow, they must obtain water 
from the soil, and food from both the soil and the air. 
They must form all parts of the plant out of these 
materials. We shall first consider how plants get their 
supply of water. 
The need for water.— There is a constant stream of 
water flowing upward towards the leaves from the roots, 
which gather it from the soil. The leaves use some of this 
water and then throw off into the air that which they do 
not need. We cannot see this current, but careful measure- 
ments show that plants send upward through their stems 
to the leaves an immense amount of water. A clover plant 
has been found to give off in one day twice its weight of 
water. A crop of hay on one acre producing two tons has 
been found to use during its growing season more than six 
hundred tons or wagon loads of water. Speaking generally, 
a crop requires about four hundred times as much water in 
a season as the weight of the dry substance in the crop. ’ 
EXPERIMENT. — What becomes of the water? A part of the water 
that passes into plants is kept there to make the plant plump and stiff 
and to help in carrying food. Most of the water merely passes through 
the plant. The roots take it in and send it up to the leaves. The leaves 
throw it off as water vapor. You can watch leaves getting rid of their 
surplus water by turning a glass upside down over a plant that is growing 
rapidly in the sunshine (Fig. 26). Every minute water is coming from 
28
-P-A-G-E-39
WATER FOR THE PLANT 29 
the leaves as vapor. As soon as the air under the glass receives more 
moisture than it can hold in the form of a vapor or gas, the extra mois- 
ture gathers in drops on the inside of the glass. 
How plants lift water.— What force enables plants to 
collect water from the ground and lift it into the roots and 
stems? To understand this, we need to study the tiny parts 
or cells of which the plant consists. We may think of a 
plant cell as a tiny room, too small 
even to be seen without a powerful 
microscope. But this little room or 
cell has no doors nor windows nor 
other openings into it. It is com- 
pletely lined on the inside with a 
layer of living jelly-like, material. 
This layer lets water and the material 
dissolved in water soak through it 
and thus pass to the inside of the 
cell. An important fact to remem- . : Fic. 26. — SHOWING THAT 
ber is that the water passes in, but = warer 1s r~.own or 
will not pass out into the soil again FROM TE Lxaves or : * anes Growinc PLants 
while the plant is healthy. This is 
partly because the water in the soil is more dilute than 
the sap which fills the plant cell; and also because the 
dilute soil water can flow in through the cell lining more 
rapidly than the denser sap inside can flow out into 
the soil. This flow of water towards the sap or denser 
liquid helps to force water upward from the roots. The 
  leaves assist in the upward flow, for water must rise 
to take the place of that which the leaves give off into 
the air.  
-P-A-G-E-40
    30 AGRICULTURE 
The water current. — The current of liquid rising from 
the roots and soil soaks through tiny canals in the stem up 
to the leaves. In trees, the tubes that carry water from 
the soil wpward are located in the sap-wood, while those 
that bring the sap downward from the leaves to build up 
all parts of the plant lie between 
the outer bark and the sap-wood. 
If you cut off a branch of a 
grapevine just as the buds are 
swelling, you will notice next day 
that the wound has “bled,” that 
is, water has been forced up to 
and out of the cut portion. When 
we speak of the sap rising in 
the spring, we mean that the roots have 
begun to force water upward. As soon 
as the leaves appear, the real sap 
will flow downward in the inner bark 
at the same time that the water from 
the soil continues to rise through the 
tiny channels nearer the center of the 
stem. 
Root-hairs.— The large roots which 
you easily see when you pull up a plant are not the ones 
that absorb water from the soil. If you will carefully 
dig up the smallest roots of a very young plant, you will 
notice that the slenderest roots are covered near their ends 
with a white coating like velvet. These white threads are 
root-hairs (Fig. 27). It is the business of each of these 
short, velvety threads, or root-hairs, to absorb moisture and    
  Fic. 27.— Root-HAIRS 
oF Squase  
-P-A-G-E-41
  WATER FOR THE PLANT 31 
dissolve plant-food from the soil. You can see the root- 
hairs plainly by causing grains of corn or any other seeds 
to sprout between moist blotting paper and by examining 
after a few days the roots that have grown out. 
Root-hairs are tiny workers that have to furnish all 
the water a large plant needs. " There are thousands 
of them on every large growing plant. # Root-hairs can 
be found only near the tips of young roots. * They are 
so slender that they can push in between the particles 
of sand or clay and absorb moisture from all the soil 
grains that touch them. It is important therefore to 
retain the small or young roots on trees or other plants 
that are to be transplanted. 
Leaves do not supply water.— The dew and rain keep 
the leaves from wasting moisture, but do not enter the 
leaves themselves. Leaves do not supply the plant with 
water. 
NOTE TO THE TEACHER. — Crosby’s Exercise 2 (see note to Sec- 
tion I) illustrates how water enters the roots of plants. You may well 
use Crosby’s Exercise 5 to show the rising of water in plants. You can 
substitute the joint of a reed for his glass tube. Have the pupils place 
seed in moist newspapers, cloth, or soil to germinate. As soon as the 
root-hairs develop require every one to hand you a drawing showing 
these.

SECTION VI. HOW PLANTS GET FOOD FROM 
SOIL AND AIR 
No solid matter can enter a plant. The living matter 
that lines the inside of each cell-wall will not let even the 
finest solid particles pass, though they be as fine as those: 
of flour or of phosphate. No part of the soil can act as 
food until it has been dissolved. 
Sugar and salt, as you know, dissolve in water, and just 
so do certain substances in the soil dissolve in the water. 
In ordinary soil this solution is very weak, so weak that 
it will usually take several thousand pounds of water to 
carry to the plant one pound of lime, phosphate, or any 
other single plant-food. In later chapters, you will learn 
what food certain plants require and also how the farmer 
adds this to any soil that is too poor to supply to the plant 
the needed nourishment. 
Plants are made largely from the air. — Fortunately for 
the farmer and for the food supply of the world, the plant 3 
obtains more material for its solid substance from the 
air than from the soil. In every hundred pounds of dry 
plants there are usually less than three pounds that come 
from the soil. The grains of wheat, corn, and rice consist * 
chiefly of starch. Other plants are rich in sugar, while 
the seeds of still others contain much oil or fat. Starch, 
sugar, oil, and many other substances in plants are made 
32 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  HOW PLANTS GET FOOD FROM SOIL AND AIR 33 
by the leaves largely from one form of carbon, which occurs 
as a gas in the air. However, there will be no abundant 
growth of leaves to make this starch, sugar, or oil unless 
the roots provice the small but necessary amounts of cer- 
tain other substances. 
Food taxena from the soil.—There are at least ten 
elements that plants draw from the soil alone. All but 
four of these are nearly always present in the soil in 
quantities sufficient to supply our crops for hundreds of 
years. The only plant-foods that are taken from the soil 
and that we need talk about in this book are those four 
that are sometimes so scarce that the farmer may have 
to add them to the soil in order to get a good crop. 
Precious forms of plant-food. — The four plant-foods or 
elements that are often not sufficiently abundant in the 
soil are ni’trd gén, phds! pho ris, po tas/si um, and cAl’- 
cgitm. We call these the precious elements, for they are 
more important to the plant and to the farmer than the 
precious metals, silver and gold. Besides, the farmer often 
has to buy them, paying silver and gold for them. 
One cause of poor crops. — These four elements exist in 
the soil in combinations; we speak of the potassium com- 
binations as potash, and of the calcium combinations as 
lime. In some soils only one of these four may be in- 
sufficient; in another soil there may be a lack of two of 
ethem; in a third three of them may be wanting; and in 
yet another soil all four of them may need to be suprlied. 
If a single one is lacking or insufficient in quantity, there 
will be a failure of the crop, no matter how abundant the 
other three may be. So it happens that a farmer may buy 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  a 
  34 AGRICULTURE 
phosphates and potash and furnish these freely to his crops, 
and yet have them fail because one of the other elements 
may be lacking. 
These precious elements and all other materials that go 
from the soil into the plant must first be dissolved in water. 
This solution of plant-food is then drawn into the cells of 
the plant and carried up through the stem, the greater 
part directly to the leaves, where it is used and mixed with 
thesubstancesthe leaves have 
made from the carbon of the 
air. The result of this diges- 
tion and mixing is a liquid 
calledsap. This sap is slowly 
distributed to all parts of the

sent: Roots help to dissolve soil. 
— Roots give off small amounts of a weak acid which dis- 
solves more of the plant-food in the soil that the roots 
touch than pure water can. This food dissolved by acid is 
added to that already dissolved from the soil by water, and 
the mixture is drawn into the plant and started towards 
  ‘the leaves. The leaves prepare this solution still further 
and make it into sap before it can nourish and build up 
the plant. 
Plants need air.— You have doubtless learned in study- 
ing physiology how persons and animals breathe. They 
take the air into the lungs and the oxygen gas which it

  HOW PLANTS GET’ FOOD FROM SOIL AND AIR 35 
contains is there taken from it for use in the body. It 
persons and land animals remain long under water they 
drown, because the supply of air is cut off. Likewise 
ordinary plants die when their leaves or roots are kept long 
under water, because they are thus deprived of sufficient 
air. 
How air enters the leaf.— Why do you suppose that 
the leaf is made so thin and broad instead of being rolled 
up into a compact, round little bundle? Leaves, even the 
thinnest, are made up of several very thin layers, each one 
of which consists of a great number of cells. In the outer 
layers of the leaf these cells lie close together, making 
a tight thin sheet which covers layers of more loosely 
arranged inner cells (Fig. 28). In these thin outer layers 
are great numbers of tiny openings. These are gateways 
for the entrance of air into the inside of the leaf. They 
are also the gates through which leaves get rid of the 
surplus water sent up by the roots. They are too small to 
be seen with the naked eye, and exist in large numbers 
on every square inch of the under side of every leaf. The 
plant can open and close these by means of special cells 
called guard-cells. When the weather is very dry, these 
gateways partly close, to keep moisture from passing too 
rapidly out of the leaves. 
Use of air by plants.— Plants and animals are alike in 
“breathing” fresh air, containing oxygen. Man and ani- 
mals take oxygen from the air to use in their lungs and 
give back a gas called carbon dioxid, which consists of 
carbon and oxygen united together. Plants, too, use oxy- 
gen; although they have no lungs. In making food-for 
   
-P-A-G-E-46
    36 AGRICULTURE 
themselves green plants use also the carbon dioxid of the 
air, such as the animals give off. In fact, through the 
pores or little gateways the air enters and comes in con- 
tact with the inside cells of the leaves. These cells take 
from the air the carbon it is holding in the form of a gas. 
This gas is called carbon dioxid. Out of this carbon 
dioxid gas and water the leaf cells form starch, sugar, and 
other substances of which plants are made. 
Leaves need light. — An interesting fact connected with 
this latter use of air by plants is that the leaf cannot use 
this carbon dioxid unless the leaf contains green coloring 
matter. This green coloring matter usually forms only 
. when there is light. Jt disappears from plants when the 
light is cut off. 
EXPERIMENT. — Examine grass covered by a board or straw, or a 
potato shoot grown in a dark room, and notice that the absence of light 
has prevented the formation of the green color and left the leaves and 
stems White. Such plants cannot grow to maturity because they cannot 
feed on the carbon in the air. So if we accidentally throw dirt over all 
the leaves of a little corn or cotton plant when cultivating the crop, we 
cut off the light and stop the growth of the plant. This is one of the 
ways by which the farmer kills. weeds, namely, by covering them with 
earth. 
ExERcISE. — What is the color of young corn plants on wet spots 
after a long period of wet weather ? This unhealthy color was caused 
by lack of what ? 
In the middle of a hot, dry day what shape does a large green leaf 
of corn take? Do the edges roll upward or downward? Do you 
think this position increases or decreases the loss of water from the 
leaves? There are special cells in the corn whose work it is to roll 
the leaf when water is scarce. They are different from the guard-celis, 
but likewise help the plant to economize water. Observe whether 
leaves are most abundant on the tips of the branches of trees or nearer

light? 
NOTE TO THE TEACHER. OPTIONAL EXERCISE. — Tincture of iodine 
makes starch change to a purple color. Add a few drops of this to 
a teaspoonful of water; with this moisten a thin slice of Irish potato,

Before staining green leaves with iodine you should dissolve out the

  SECTION VII. HOW PLANTS ARE. 
PROPAGATED 
Most of our field crops are increased or propagated by 
means of seed. One plant, because of the seeds it forms, 
may become the parent of hundreds or of thousands of 
others of the same kind. This method of. increasing 
plants is well understood. 
There are some plants the seed of which must be sown 
every year, for example, oats and corn. These are called 
annuals, because they live during only one growing 
season. Plants that live two years are known as dzennials. 
A third class consists of the perennials, that is, plants that 
live for more than two years. Bermuda grass, alfalfa, 
and all trees are examples of perennial plants. 
- Most cultivated plants, including the perennials, develop 
from seeds. With most fruit trees and with many other 
plants, it is best to provide for the increase by budding, 
grafting, and the like. These and other methods of multi- 
plying plants without the use of seeds are called propaga- 
tion by division. 
Some plants propagated by buds.— Did you ever see 
seeds on sugar cane or sweet potatoes? In tropical 
countries these plants make seed, but not usually in our 
country. Since these plants as a rule form no seed here, 
38
-P-A-G-E-49
  HOW PLANTS ARE PROPAGATED 39 
we must find some other part of them that will grow. The 
part of the plant that can most nearly take the place of 
a seed is a bud. The sugar planter places long sugar 
canes.in the ground, expecting the buds on them to grow. 
In place of the sugar cane he may plant a piece of an 
Irish potato containing one or more eyes, or clusters of 
buds. But if he so cuts the potato that one piece has no 
bud in it, no plant will grow from it and he will have a 
vacant hill. ; 
Most fruits do not ‘‘ come true’? from seed. — One reason 
why the grower uses buds of sugar cane, sweet potatoes, 
and seedless oranges is because he cannot get seeds to 
plant. There are advantages in using buds instead of 
seed in some cases even when the seed can easily be 
obtained. 
By planting the seed of the peach we do not get peaches 
just like the one from which the seed came. The same 
thing is true with apples, pears, strawberries, and most 
of our fruits. Of such fruits we say, they do not ‘come 
. true” from the seed. ‘ s 
> Budding.— The method of growing fruit like that on 
the parent tree is by budding or grafting. If we grow 
peach, apple, or other trees from buds, we may be quite 
sure that the fruit on the young tree will be like its parent 
and much like all other perfect fruit in the same variety. 
1f you take a hundred buds frem one peach tree and cause 
these to grow into a hundred young trees, they will all bear 
fruit practically alike. In this case, the trees wouid be more ~ 
closely akin to each other than would be a hundred trees 
grown from the seeds from one tree. This is so because a    
-P-A-G-E-50
  40 AGRICULTURE 
bud is a part of only ove plant. A seed is often made by 
two plants, and the different seedlings may resemble either 
parent, while each budded tree has only one parent. 
Cuttings. — Plants are increased either by planting seeds 
or buds. If, however, you should plant in the ground a 
detached bud from a grape-vine or from 
any fruit tree, it would not grow. It would 
die (1) because a bud cannot at first get 
any food from the soil, and (2) because 
such a bud has not much food stored up 
to nourish it until it forms roots of its own. 
But you may so plant it that it will have 
much ready-made food convenient. Be- 
fore the leaves start, cut off pieces of 
fig trees or grape-vine of last year’s growth 
six or eight inches long and containing at 
least three buds (Fig. 30), These pieces 
of stem or branch are called cuttings. 
Plant these in sandy soil, the upper bud 
just above the surface and the lower bud 
deep in the soil. If you have done this as 
a skilful gardener does, you will see after 
a few weeks that the upper bud has begun 
to develop into a branch, which in time will 
be a real bearing grape-vine. If you dig up one of these 
little grape sticks that has thus begun to grow, you will 
find that tiny roots have grown. It was the food material 
stored in the stem or cutting that enabled the buds to 
grow. 
The use of various kinds of cuttings is the usual way of 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
HOW PLANTS ARE PROPAGATED 4l 
increasing grapes, figs, poplars, and many other kinds of 
plants. The cuttings should have two or more joints. 
Grape cuttings usually have two or three buds. The usual 
time to put them in the ground is late winter. Under a 
cover of glass, and sometimes without this covering, many 
kinds of flowers can be increased by means of cuttings, 
for example, roses and geraniums. The chief use of the 
cover is to keep moisture in the leaf, the soil, and the air. 
Uses of budding and grafting. — So if we wish to make 
a grape, or peach, or apple bud grow, we must plant it, 
not by itself in the soil, but joined to enough of the wood 
and bark to furnish it with a supply of ready-made food. 
This is what the fruit-grower does when he plants cut- 
tings of the grape or when he buds his peach or grafts 
his apple trees. 
You can learn how to bud and graft fruit trees and roses 
if you will study the pictures and directions and will prac- 
tice a little every day for a week or two. By budding or 
grafting the poorer varieties in your parents’ orchards with 
, the buds or twigs from the best variety in some neighbor’s 
orchard, you will be of real help at home and will probably 
be able to enjoy some of the improved fruit yourself. 
Directions for grafting. — Grafting consists in making a 
short piece of twig of one plant unite with the branch 
or root of another. The plant that furnishes the twig 
(called: a ¢2’0z) must be very closely akin to the plant 
upon whose branch or root the cion is to grow. The 
plant or piece from which the roots spring is called the 
stock. Generally, stocks are common young plants that 
have been grown from seed, Usually, the cion is a short

buds. The stock may bea young piece of root, a young or

  anold branch. Grafting is generally done 
in the late winter or very early in spring, 
while the plant is resting. 
In Figure 31 is shown one way of cut- 
ting the cions and the stocks in grafting 
apple cions on small branches or small 
pieces of apple root. Your knife must 
be sharp and thin, so as not to split the 
cion or stock in making the slit. After 
cutting the two pieces as shown in the 
figure, place their 
ends together, mak- 
ing the two slender 
tongues lock. The 
important point is to 
make sure that on 
one side the dark of 
the two pieces comes together evenly. 
The union is caused by the layer 
just under the bark of the cion 
growing against the similar layer 
in the stock. These growing layers 
must touch on at least one side of the 
graft. Insetting in the ground cions 
that have been grafted on roots, the

Budding. —Budding 
consists in inserting a

should be cut out with a

  44 AGRICULTURE 
slender piece of bark and wood about three fourths of an 
inch long, leaving a part of the leaf stem for use as a 
handle. This is the way in which peach and mest other 
fruit trees are increased. Budding is usually done in 
summer while the plants 
are in active growth. 
To serve as stock for 
budding, an apple tree 
may be about two years 
old, but a peach seed- 
ling can be budded in 
its first year of growth.

and 1 of tallow. When heated, pour the mixture into cold water, grease 
your hands, and “ pull” it as you would “ pull” molasses candy.

  SECTION VIII. IMPROVEMENT OF PLANTS 
Our valuable cultivated plants have been changed from 
poor or useless wild plants. The tomato, for example, 
bore very small and worthless fruits, and the cultivated 
Tose was once a wild rose with few petals. Greatly as 
man has improved plants in the past, recent discoveries 
of some of the laws of improvement should make future 
progress still more rapid. 
Selection. — By selection, or choosing seeds from the 
most desirable individuals, plants may be slowly changed. 
Selection is the easiest, surest, and usual method of im- 
provement. In plants and animals the general rule is 
that the offspring resembles the parents and grandparents. 
But among the five hundred or more stalks grown by 
planting the kernels of a single ear of corn, there may 
usually be found several that have larger ears than others 
from the same ear. All crops can be made more produc. 
tive by using seeds from a small seed-plot that is planted 
every year with the seeds from the best plants of the year 
before. 
In selecting, we may, for example, take a variety of 
corn that has usually produced only one ear and select the 
few plants that have several ears. If we plant these seed 
by themselves and in that crop again select the stalks with 
most ears, and so on every season, in a few years we shall 
46  
-P-A-G-E-57
  IMPROVEMENT OF PLANTS 47 
have a new variety in which most of the plants will bear 
several ears. This is improvement by selection. Even 
plants such as potatoes, that do not generally produce 
seeds, have been improved by selecting the best hills for 
planting the next year. 
Select for one quality at a time.—In improving a 
variety, change can be made most rapidly by selecting 
  Fic. 37. Some RESULTS OF CROSSING TWO VARIETIES OF CORN OF 
D1rFERENT CoLors 
chiefly for one thing ata time. That is, we must decide, 
say with corn, whether we would rather increase the length 
of ear, or the length of kernels, or the number of ears per 
plant. We might desire all three of these qualities in our 
new variety, but it would take many years to make the 
desired improvement, if we chose one plant for number of 
ears, another for length of ear, and a third for length of 
kernel, and planted these seeds together. The better way 
is to find some variety of corn already existing that is 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
48 AGRICULTURE 
really good enough to suit us in all qualities except one. 
Suppose it is desired to increase the number of ears on 
one stalk. Rapid increase, in this case, would come 
from selecting our seed ears only from plants bearing sev- 
eral ears. Among these several-eared plants preference 
would be given to those that have the other desirable 
qualities in the greatest degree. 
Mixture of pollen from inferior plants. — This improve- 
ment by selection could not be made if the ear selected 
were planted where the pollen from a field of poor, unim- 
proved corn would reach the silks (Fig. 37). If some of 
the stalks in the field are poor or barren, as shown by 
having no ear-shoot, the tassels of such plants should be 
pulled off before the pollen has begun to fall. 
The improvement by selection goes on more rapidly if 
the offspring of cach of the best plants is planted sefa- 
rately. It is best to plant each set of seeds in a séparate 
row. Selection should be made for planting the seed- 
patch the next year by choosing the ears from the most 
productive plants oz the best row, or the choice cotton 
plants in the dest row of cotton. Unfortunately the plants 
of field corn, of cotton, and of most cultivated plants do 
not show resemblance to the pollen-bearing parent the 
first season. The crop of common field corn does not 
suffer in yield the first season from a cross with inferior 
pollen. The next season, however, the corn from such 
crosses is poor, and even the best ears thus produced will 
not bear uniform offspring. Popcorn and sweet corn 
may show the change the first year. 
Temporary and permanent improvement. — It is difficult 
} 
f
-P-A-G-E-59
IMPROVEMENT OF PLANTS 49 
to distinguish between temporary improvement, and that 
which will be permanent through later generations. 
Usually an increase in the size of a plant due simply to 
one year of special fertilizing, watering, or extra space is 
temporary. The large size, it seems, is not inherited by 
the offspring. Improvement due to years of selection is, 
however, inherited (Fig. 39). The most valuable plant for 
seed purposes is not always the plant that happens to be 
the largest, but rather the one that will produce productive 
offspring of good quality. This is the reason why in a 
seed-patch 7¢ zs better to plant all the descendants of one 
parent plant together in one row, so that the farmer may 
judge the parent by the average character of the off- 
spring. 
The farmer who would improve or “ breed up” his corn, 
cotton, wheat, oats, or other crop, should have a special 
breeding plot or seed-patch and should carefully observe 
each plant grown there. Sometimes it happens that there 
is a singie plant that is decidedly superior to all the others, 
and seed of this “sport,” or very unusual plant, may start 
a new and more valuable variety. 
Home-grown seed often the best. — If seed of corn grown 
for many years in a colder country is brought to the 
Southern states and seed from this variety planted for 
several years in the South, each year the variety gets 
later and later and the stalks larger and larger. 
If early vegetables are desired, make them earlier by 
getting seed grown far North where the plant has learned 
to be in a hurry to get ripe in a short season. Field corn 
from north of the Ohio River is earlier and smaller, and in 
4 
 
-P-A-G-E-60

  50 AGRICULTURE 
most parts of the South yields less, than our native corn. 
Likewise, when the cotton-boll weevil invades any regioa, 
early varieties of cotton grown on the northern edge of the 
cotton belt ripen a considerable part of their crop before 
the weevils destroy the squares and blossoms. 
A change of seed should not ‘be made unless there is 
good reason for it or unless better seed can thus be ob-

tained. A crop suited to the South does not “run out” 
or grow worthless if properly managed. A plant usually 
becomes better fitted for its new home by being grown 
there for a number of years. Seed grown from out 
own field crops in nearly the same climate should be 
preferred. 
Improvement by crossing plants. — Sometimes the plant- 
breeder must resort to crossing in order to unite in one 
plant the good qualities of two different varieties. Sup- 
pose, for example, he wishes to improve a variety of corn 
the ears of which are too small, by using the pollen from  
-P-A-G-E-61
  IMPROVEMENT OF PLANTS 51 
a large-eared variety. Before the silk is seen on the 
mother plant, he must tie a paper bag over the ear shoot. 
Soon after the silks show, the plant-breeder carefully 
pulls a tassel from a plant of the large-eared variety. 
The pollen should be just ready to fly. He dusts this 
over the silks of a selected plant and repeats this next 
day, keeping the shoot under the bag until the silks dry. 
He may wish also to cause a big-boll variety of cotton 
to grow a longer staple. Before the cotton-bud or young 
bloom of the big-boll variety is ready to open, or about 
sunset or sunrise, the plant-breeder opens or cuts away 
the upper parts of the white petals, and with a knife, 
small scissors, or fingers, removes every anther or pollen 
case (Fig. 38). This is done before these cases have 
opened and spilled their pollen on the pistil of the same 
flower. .A small paper bag is then tied over the injured 
flower to keep insects from bringing any pollen toit. Pollen 
from a selected long-staple plant can now be used, after 
the pistil is more mature. After most of the cotton 
blossoms have opened, or between eight and ten o'clock 
in the morning, our plant-breeder comes back, removes 
the paper bag, and gently rubs over the top of the pistil 
a flower from a plant of the long-staple variety, on which 
the pollen is beginning to shed. The particles of pollen 
now cling to the sticky surface on the stigma and grow 
there. The bag is replaced and removed five days later, 
when, if all is well, a young boll is found. The seeds pro- 
duced in that boll are the offspring of both varieties. 
If, however, the thirty to forty seeds from that boll all 
grow into mature plants, the next year these sister plants
-P-A-G-E-62
52 AGRICULTURE 
will not be all alike. Some will resemble the big-boll 
mother plant; some will be like the long-staple father 
plant; some will be unlike either; and some may combine 
the likeness of both parents. The plant-breeder must 
plant the seed, giving a separate row to the seed of each 
plant; for several years in succession he must select for 
seed the plants that come nearest to uniting the qualities 
that he wishes — large bolls and long lint. It will usually 
be best for the farmer to rely for improvement on selec- 
tion alone, rather than on crossing. 
Cross-pollination generally better than self-pollination.— 
Generally, pollen is most effective in causing seed to de- 
velop when the pollen and the pistil are borne on different 
plants. When the pollen of a corn plant standing alone 
falls on the silks of the same plants, grains develop. But 
the plants grown from such corn grains are less vigorous 
and productive than plants from seed having two parents 
not closely related. Itis to avoid self-pollination that some 
seed-breeders pull the immature tassels from the corn 
plants on the rows from which they intend to select their 
best seed corn. 
EXERCISE. — Farmers’ boys can greatly increase next year’s corn 
crop by selecting a few bushels of seed from the best plants. 
When wheat or oats are ripe, remember, if you live on a farm, to 
watch for the best plants and to save seeds from a few of them for 
planting by themselves next year. 
Have all the wild plants suitable for human use been cultivated and 
improved? Perhaps you will be the one to bring another wild forage 
plant or flower into use. 
NoTE TO THE TEACHER. — Emphasize the great opportunity for 
good in selecting seed from the best plants. Weighing the product 
of good and very poor plants of corn, cotton, potatoes, etc., will help

to point this lesson, especially if a calculation is made of the difference 
in yield from an acre of each of the two types of plants. 
If any large flowers, like cotton, tobacco, or morning-glory, are 
blooming, let the pupils carefully remove every stamen from a bud in 
which the pollen sacks have not yet burst. Tie cloth or paper over 
the injured flower. Grocers’ small paper bags are good. After a 
number of hours collect pollen from other flowers of the same kind and 
dust this pollen over the tip of the pistil in the injured flower. Cover 
it again. In a week or two see whether seeds have formed.

    SECTION IX. HOW THE SOIL WAS FORMED. 
KINDS OF SOILS 
Tr we hammer a small piece of stone, we can usually 
change it into a powder. The tiny particles that make 
up this powder are often like some of the grains of the 
soil that may be found near the stone. What is now soil, 
in ages past was solid rock. Far mightier forces than the 
heaviest of hammers cracked and ground these ancient 
rocks for thousands of years, until they crumbled into sand 
and soil. As the earth’s surface cooled, and shrunk, and 
wrinkled, the rocks cracked. Water standing in these 
cracks and tiny rough places froze. In freezing, the water 
expanded, and thus broke off great and tiny pieces of rock. 
Air and water, just as they eat slowly into iron, forming 
iron rust, so changed and dissolved some of the cementing 
material in the rock. Then the remaining parts of the 
large rocks crumbled. 
Water grinds rocks into soil.—Streams‘of water rolled 
the sharp-edged pieces of rock against each other, grind- 
ing off the sharp points, making sand of the fragments, and 
leaving rounded stones and pebbles. When a boy wishes 
nice, smooth stones for his sling shot, he knows he will find 
them in the bed of a stream. While searching for smooth 
stones, he walks over a sand-bar. This sand-bar shows how 
soil was formed. It is made partly of fine gravel, partly

of similar material ground into coarse sand, and of still 
finer material which is called soil. When the stream over- 
flows, it sometimes forms a similar sand-bar in the lowlands

that the next generation of plants is larger. After some 
years this may become fertile soil. ° 
Tiny plants called mosses and lic'fen$ sometimes grow 
on bare rock. The roots of these not only dissolve the 
softer parts of the rock, but by their decay fertilize later 
generations of higher plants, until in time a shallow soi] 
is formed in the pockets in the surface of the rock.

Soil and subsoil.— We see that the soil is the finely 
divided surface layer of the earth in which higher plants 
can grow. It consists of two portions, which are not 
always alike, (1) the looser, upper layer, or soz/ proper, and 
(2) the more compact layer under this, called the sudsoil. 
The soil consists chiefly of sand and clay, but neither 
one of these is food for plants. Sand is useful in keeping 
soil from packing too closely, and from being too wet and 
sticky. Clay is useful in holding moisture and cementing 
the sand grains together. A small part of the clay, under 
proper conditions, can finally be changed into plant-food. 
Much more useful to plants as food are the decaying re- 
mains of earlier generations of plants. These remains of 
plants are usually spoken of as vegetable, or organic 
matter, or kumus. There is much more vegetable matter 
in the soil than in the subsoil. Hence the soil produces 
much larger crops than the subsoil can when it is first 
brought to the surface. This is because the vegetable 
matter in the soil supplies plant-food, holds moisture, and 
makes the soil loose and mellow, permitting the roots 
and air to penetrate it. The subsoil, when first thrown 
up from the bottom of a ditch, is unsuitable for plant 
growth, but after it has been exposed to the air for several 
years, plants grow on this changed subsoil as well as 
anywhere else. 
Available and unavailable plant-food in the soil.— The 
soil contains all of the chemical elements found in plants, 
and many more besides. All cultivated soils are rich 
enough in most of these elements, so only those elements or 
compounds which are sometimes scarce need be considered.
-P-A-G-E-67
  HOW THE SOIL WAS FORMED 57 
These are nitrogen, phosphoric acid, potash, and lime. In 
a soil that brings poor crops there may sometimes be enough 
of all of these, but they may be held so tightly by the iron 
or clay that water cannot dissolve and carry them into 
plants. Such insoluble substances are spoken of as un- 
available. These can be changed into soluble forms, cr 
available plant-food, by the oxygen of the air, and the de 
cay of vegetable matter. To make the plant-food in the stiff 
soil or subsoil useful, therefore, the soil must be loosened 
with the plow, and the surplus water drained, thus letting 
in the oxygen of the air. Oxygen is called the restless 
element, because it is continually seeking change, and 
causing other elements in the soil to change also. 
How decay of vegetable matter prepares plant-food. — The 
decay of vegetable matter in the soil helps to make the soi: 
elements more soluble, partly by loosening the soil, so that 
the oxygen of the air can reach all parts of it. It also 
helps because the carbonic acid formed during its decay is 
absorbed by the water in the soil; this mixture of water 
and carbonic acid has a much stronger dissolving power 
than pure water alone. The rotting of vegetable matter 
helps to soften or rot the hardest rock and stiffest soil. 
Of course the decay of former generations of plants also 
furnishes plant-food directly to later generations. 
Soils not permanently exhausted. — Even in a rich soil 
only a small part of the nitrogen, phosphoric acid, potash, 
and lime is in a soluble condition. They become soluble 
very slowly and gradually, so that roots have near them 
a small but continuous supply of newly prepared food. 
This is well, for if all of these elements in the soil were in
-P-A-G-E-68
  58 AGRICULTURE 
a soluble condition, a succession of heavy rains would dis- 
solve and wash all of the plant-food out of the soil and 
carry it to the ocean. But since only a small part of the 
phosphoric acid and potash of the soil are in a soluble 
condition, no soil can be permanently or completely ex- 
hausted. It is possible to restore the fertility of any soil 
that has a fair proportion of clay in it. 
Clay and sand. — Examine a little sample of clay soil 
and another of sandy soil. When you rub them between 
your fingers the clay soil feels smooth, while the sandy 
soil feels coarse and gritty. Sand grains are hundreds of 
times larger than the tiny grains of clay. They are so 
large that they do not settle closely together, and the 
spaces between them allow water to run very rapidly 
through. Sandy soil, therefore, will not hold water well. 
We can scarcely understand how small the separate 
particles of clay are. It would require more than fifty 
thousand fine particles of clay side by side to cover a 
line one inch long. Since the grains or particles of clay 
are so small, they can be packed tightly together, leav- 
ing very little space between. It is difficult, therefore, 
for air and water to penetrate a clay soil. 
Granulation. — Fortunately, in well-cultivated,  well- 
drained, clay soils, supplied with vegetable matter, a 
number of the tiny particles cling together in one group 
or granule. Each of these groups acts like a single sand 
grain, leaving spaces between granules open enough for 
water to drain through and for air to enter. This granu 
lation, or grouping into granules, is the condition the farmer 
- wishes his clay soil to assume. If, however, he plows when
-P-A-G-E-69
HOW THE SOIL WAS -FORMED 59 
the soil is too wet, the plow breaks up these groups and 
packs close together the tiny particles that, before formed 
the granule. Great clods are then formed, so that a single 
plowing when the clay soil is too wet may injure the field 
for many years. 
Coarse- and fine-grained soils. — Soils may be arranged 
in the following order, according to the coarseness of 
the particles of which they consist, beginning with the 
coarsest and ending with the finest : — 
Gravel. Fine sand. Silt loam. 
Gravelly loam. Sandy loam. Clay loam. 
Coarse sand. Fine sandy loam. Clay. 
Sand, Loam. 
The most satisfactory soils are those consisting of a mix- 
ture of sand and clay. These are called /oam soils. They 
have enough sand to make them pulverize easily and drain 
well, together with enough clay to hold sufficient moisture 
for plants and furnish a gradual supply of certain kinds ot 
plant-food. The coarsest soils become “worn out” soonest. 
Clay soils usually last longer because they contain the 
largest amount of total plant-food. They require more 
tillage, however, to make this plant-food available. 
Treatment of sandy and clay soils.—You have just 
learned that a clay soil must not be plowed when wet. 
But if a soil consists almost wholly of sand, plowing it 
when rather wet does little harm. After plowing a clay 
soil the large lumps must be broken with a harrow 
before they dry and become hard clods. Live-stock 
should not be allowed to pass over clay soil while it~ 
   
-P-A-G-E-70

is wet because their tracks make clods, just as plow- 
ing does. 
EXERCISE. — Find what curious kinds of tiny plants are growing on

Dig into several fields to learn how deep is the mellow soil. What 
differences do you find between the soil and the harder subsoil ? Do

Note TO THE TEACHER. — Samples of several soils,as clay, sandy 
loam, and woods’ earth, each on a separate newspaper, where they can

grees of adhesiveness, grittiness, fineness, and their probable relation 
to (1) ease of plowing, (2) drainage, and (3) wear on implements 
during plowing.

SECTION X. SUITING THE CROP TO THE 
SOIL 
TuE proportion of sand to clay or silt in the soil and 
subsoil determines not only how much water the soil will 
hold, but also for what crops it is best suited. It is impor- 
tant to learn the character of the subsoil by digging down 
below the layer usually plowed. A sandy soil with a grav- 
elly or sandy, open subsoil may be almost worthless; but 
a soil which, when plowed, looks exactly like this, but is 
underlaid by a clay or clay-loam subsoil, may be a produc- 
tive and durable soil. In choosing a farm or a field, a 
farmer must look below the surface. 
Best uses for sandy soils. — A sandy soil is usually a 
warm soil for the reason that sand absorbs heat rapidly. 
Another reason is because it is well drained, there being 
but little water left in it to be heated, thus allowing the 
sun’s heat to be used to warm the soil grains. This kind 
of soil, therefore, is one well suited to early vegetables. 
Peaches also thrive on sandy soils and cotton is better 
suited to them than is corn. This is because cotton is 
less injured than corn by a scarcity of soil moisture. A 
sandy soil is usually not good-for wheat nor for hay 
grasses, but the finer grades of tobacco are grown on it. 
For certain kinds of tobacco the soils of the Southern 
states shown on soil maps as “Orangeburg fine sandy 
61
-P-A-G-E-72

loam” are especially suited. Peanuts, sweet-potatoes, 
cowpeas, and watermelons are good crops for sandy soils. 
Best uses for clay soils. — Since clay soils contain so 
much water, they are slow in warming in the spring. You 
know that if you dip your hand in water, even in rather

warm water, and then expose it to the air, the skin becomes 
cool. This is because evaporation of water (that is, the 
changing of water from a liquid into the form of a gas or 
water vapor) has required heat and has drawn this heat 
from the skin. In a stiff clay soil much of the water must 
be evaporated from the surface. This uses the heat that 
ought to be used in warming the soil. Hence a clay soil 
is a cold soil, and crops growing in it start late,
-P-A-G-E-73
  SUITING ‘THE CROP TO THE SOIL 63 
Clay soils are moist, and therefore the best crops for 
tnem are those requiring much water. As shown in an 
earlier chapter, a crop of hay requires an immense amount 
of water. Timothy grass, Johnson grass, red clover, and 
most hay plants, therefore, do well on clay soils. Apples 
need plenty of water and accordingly thrive on the best 
grades of clay soil. Certain kinds of clay soils afford the 
‘est summer pastures. 
Hiliy, rolling, and level land.— Fields that consist of 
steep hillsides have a tendency to wash. They must be 
terraced, but then the terraces and the original steepness 
of the hill prevent the use of labor-saving implements. For 
this reason it costs more to cultivate such fields than rolling 
or nearly level land. The tendency to wash is reduced if 
the hillsides are covered with a uniform coat of’ pasture 
plants, such as Japan clover and Bermuda grass (Fig. 42). 
Level lands are often poorly drained and in the spring are 
slow to get in condition for plowing. When drained, 
either by man or naturally, such lands can be very.econom- 
ically cultivated. For this reason, drainage ought to be 
the first thing to receive attention. The best labor-saving 
implements can be used and, if desired, the crop can be 
cultivated in hills or checks so as to be plowed in two 
directions, thus almost ‘avoiding hoeing. 
Rolling lands are those with moderate slopes. They 
have most of the advantages of level lands, and in addition 
are more easily drained. 
Crops for lime soils.— Most cultivated plants grow well 
on a lime soil, while a few are suited only to such a soil. 
Alfalfa and red clover, both of them forage plants belong: 
   
-P-A-G-E-74
  ee 64 AGRICULTURE 
_ ing to the bean or clover family, require land rich in 
lirne. 
Thus alfalfa succeeds finely on the best grades of the 
black lime or prairie lands in Alabama and Mississippi, 
and on the similar “ black waxy” lands of Texas. On the 
same class of soil, Johnson grass hay is grown for market. 
Red clover is adapted to the lime lands found in many of 
the valleys in the northern parts of some of the Gulf 
states and to limestone soils common in Tennessee, Ken- 
tucky, and the sections to the north. 
Color of soils. — If two soils are made up of particles of 
the same size, the darker one is usually the warmer. This 
is because dark soils, like dark clothes, absorb the sun’s 
heat. A light-colored, sandy soil, hewever, may be warmer 
than a dark clay soil. 
A dark color generally indicates fertility, and is due to 
the presence of much humus. 
EXERCISE. — In your neighborhood what crops are generally grown 
on the most sandy soil ? What use is made of the wettest land ? How 
are clay lands utilized ? Hilly lands? Very black lands ? What are 
the favorite grass lands? Orchard lands ? 
NoTE TO THE TEACHER. — Write to the Bureau of Soils, Washing- 
ton, D.C., asking for a report on a soil survey of your county, or of the 
region most like yours. Explain to the pupils the main features of the 
colored map in that report.
-P-A-G-E-75
SECTION XI. ae IN THE SOIL 
Tue difference between a rich and a poor soil consists 
largely in the fact that a rich soil is usually able to maintain 
enough moisture, but not too much; while the unproductive 
soil does not hold enough water for the use of the plant 
during periods of dry weather, and becomes too completely 
saturated during wet weather. 
Clay soils hold water.— Soils differ widely in the 
amount of moisture that they can hold. Test this by filling 
two tomato cans of equal size with thoroughly dried soil, 
one of them with nearly pure sand and the other with the 
stiffest clay you can find. Pack both soils thoroughly, and 
gradually add equal amounts of water to each. Before 
any dripping from the clay occurs, water will have begun 
to drip freely from the sandy soil through the holes in the 
bottom of the tin can. Thus it is seen that clay will hold 
much more water than sandy soil. 
Capillary moisture. — The water that drains away from 
the soil is called free water. It is spoken of as free be- 
cause it always flows toward the lowest point. If cans of 
soil are allowed to drain for a day or two, although most 
of the free water will be removed, the soils will still be 
moist. The moisture remaining in the soil is called cap’- 
illary moisture. It is spread out over the surface of the 
soil grains in such thin layers or films that it cannot col- 
lect in drops and drain away. If a bag of pebbles is

dipped into a bowl of water, the water which adheres to 
their surfaces is capillary moisture. It forms a very thin 
layer. There may be millions upon millions of soil grains 
in every cubic inch of soil, and to cover every one of these

FACE OF EVERY PEBBLE IN THE TUMBLER ON THE LEFT AND OF EVERY 
GraINn OF SAND IN THAT ON THE RIGHT 
over its entire surface with the thinnest possible coat of 
moisture requires a large amount of water (Fig. 43). 
Movements of free and of capillary moisture.— The 
farmer endeavors to remove a part of the free water from 
the soil by drainage and to retain in the soil as much cap- 
illary moisture as possible. He desires the free water to 
drain away, because it occupies the spaces between the 
soil grains and thus keeps out the air, which is needed by 
the roots. Free water moves only toward a lower level;
-P-A-G-E-77
  MOISTURE IN THE SOIL 67 
but capillary moisture on the other hand moves in any 
direction, but always very slowly. This is an advantage, 
for if this moisture moved as rapidly as the free water it 
would rise to the surface and evaporate. The earth would 
then become so dry that plants would die (Fig. 44). 
It is also fortunate for the farmer that the capillary

Fic. 44. — OUTFIT ror SHOWING THE HEIGHTS TO WHICH CAPILLARY MoIsTURE 
RISES IN SOILS 
moisture moves toward the dryest soil. Thus root-hairs 
lying in contact with the sheet of water that wraps up 
one soil grain, absorb a large part of this moisture, but its
-P-A-G-E-78
  68 AGRICULTURE 
place is soon taken by capillary moisture which moves in 
from moister particles (Fig 45). 
Air-spaces check the movement of capillary water. — 
The farmer’s part in preparing the ground and cultivating 
the soil consists chiefly in controlling the movement of 
capillary moisture. This moisture moves about only when 
the soil particles touch each other, so that the dry can 
borrow from the damp 
grain. If an_ air-space 
occurs between two soil 
particles, moisture will not 
move across this. The soil 
best prepared for seeds or 
roots is one having no

which has been loosened up some time before the seeds 
are planted. 
The farmer first loosens his soil, then permits the lower 
layers to become settled, and later, after the crop begins 
to grow, he stirs the surface. The surface layer is stirred 
in order to make large air-spaces, that will prevent the 
moisture a little deeper down from coming to the sur- 
face and being evaporated and carried off by the wind. 
Earthworms are found under logs, boards, and stones be- 
cause these places are moist, while the ground around is dry. 
The moisture in the soil cannot easily rise up through the 
logs, boards, or stones and evaporate. The gardener makes
-P-A-G-E-79
MOISTURE IN THE SOIL 69 
use of this principle when he places a layer of leaves over 
strawberries, potatoes, or any crop that he wishes to keep 
well supplied with moisture. He calls such a layer of 
leaves a mu/ch, which simply means a cover to protect the 
soil against evaporation. The farmer cannot afford to 
place layers of leaves over his fields, but he can afford to 
make a mulch by using material that is already there. 
He can make a mulch of the sotl itself, proviaed the top 
layer can be made loose and dry. How this is done will 
be iearned in the next chapter.

SECTION XII. PREPARATION AND CULTIVA- 
TION OF THE SOIL 
  BeErore the seed is sown the land is plowed. The maia 
object of early plowing is to form a loose melew lever of 
soil through which the roots can spread in any direction. 
When to plow. — When the plowing is well done, the 
soil is broken into small particles. This will not re- 
sult, however, if the soil is very dry when plowed, for then 
great lumps and clods are turned over. On the other 
hand, the soil does not pulverize well if plowed when wet 
enough for it to stick together and’ to show a shiny, 
polished surface on the furrow slice. Only experience will 
tell just how wet or how dry the soil should be when 
plowed. Extremes should be avoided.. Plowing when the 
land is very dry means poor plowing, but it does the land 
no permanent harm. But to plow land when it is too wet 
may injure the soil for several years, especially if it con- 
tains much clay. 
A good seed-bed. —In the previous section it was learned 
that capillary moisture moves toward the roots best when 
the soil has no very large air-spaces. It is often well, 
therefore, to plow land a number of weeks before it is to 
be occupied by the roots of ‘the crop. An opportunity 
is thus given the soil to settle and become compact. 
A seed must have moisture in order to germinate, and 
7O    
-P-A-G-E-81
  PREPARATION AND CULTIVATION OF THE SOIL 71 
the best seed-bed is one compact enough to permit the 
capillary moisture to move toward the seed, and yet loose 
enough to permit air also to come in contact with the seed. 
Roots, as well as seeds, require enough compactness of soil 
for the easy movement of capillary water toward the 
thirsty root hairs, and likewise sufficient looseness of soil 
to admit a little air and to allow the roots to grow freely 
in any direction. 
If the soil is in good condition when plowed, the neces- 
sary compactness can often be had simply by allowing 
several weeks 
for the rains to 
make it compact 
or to settle it. 
Sometimes it is 
necessary to use 
implements for 
this purpose, especially the harrow, the plank drag, or the 
roller. Clods are most easily broken when first plowed. 
Let the harrow therefore follow close behind the plow. 
After plowing or rolling, the harrow should be used im- 
mediately so as to leave on the surface a loose layer of 
dry soil. This loose surface layer contains so many and 
such large air-spaces that the moisture from the compacted 
layer below cannot easily cross these and rise to the sur- 
face, where it would be evaporated. Air-spaces in the 
loose surface layer do good by imprisoning the moisture 
in the lower layers. 
The largest crops are generally made on those soils 
where the roots of cultivated plants grow deepest. This 
  Fic. 47.—A PLank Drac

72 -» AGRICULTURE 
shows that it is best to plow deep unless there are reasons 
for not doing so. If land is plowed two or three inches 
deeper than it has ever been plowed before, there is danger 
that the first crop after such deep plowing will be injured by 
the subsoil which is brought to the surface. This subsoil 
often dries and forms a hard crust that interferes with plant 
growth. Moreover, the plant-food in this layer of sub- 
soil may not be in such a form that the plant can immedi- 
ately use it. But the longer it lies on the surface exposed 
to the air, the more fertile it becomes. Generally, deep 
plowing is beneficial to the second and the third crops, 
even if not to the first crop. 
Subsoil plowing. — The depth of plowing can be in- 
creased without any danger of injuring the first crop if 
each year the plowing is about one inch deeper than the 
year before. The depth of the plowed soil can be suddenly 
increased by the use of a subsoil plow, which simply loosens 
the subsoil, but does not bring it to the surface. In using 
a subsoil plow we must make sure that the lower layers 
ot soil are dry enough to be pulverized. Subsoiling is 
usually best done in the fall, because at this time the sub- 
soil is apt to be dry and capable of crumbling. Harm and 
no good comes from plowing the subsoil when it is very 
damp. 
When to cultivate. — Most cultivation consists in de- 
stroying the plants not needed and in forming a shallow 
layer of loose soil at the surface of the ground. It is just 
as important to form this mulch, or loose, light layer of 
soil, as it is to destroy the weeds. Cultivation is often 
needed when there are no weeds. We may he sure that it 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
PREPARATION AND CULTIVATION OF THE SOIL 73 
is needed whenever a surface crust forms on the land, 
as after a rain. 
By breaking this crust and the adjacent parts of the 
soil with a cultivating implement, a layer of loose soil is 
formed that contains many large air-spaces. Across these 
air-spaces moisture cannot move, but must remain in the 
lower layers near the root. A crust must not be allowed 
to form; cultivation will o ihe:

Atthe same moment stand upright in this ink on their flat ends the 
unbroken and the broken piece of chalk. Carefully place the upper por- 
tion of the broken piece on its lower part, in the position it occupied 
before being broken. Watch the ink rise upward into both. Notice 
that when the liquid reaches the crack, its rise is checked by the air- 
space between the two broken pieces of chalk. This shows how air- 
spaces in cultivated soil keep moisture from rising rapidly to the sur- 
face, where it would be evaporated. : 
A similar experiment can be made with entire and broken lumps of 
sugar placed in a thin layer of coffee. 
NoTe TO THE TEACHER. — Designate two or three pupils to make 
the following experiment : — 
Fill five similar open cans with the same amount of damp soil, 
packed in equally. Leave one as it is, thoroughly cultivate one to a 
depth of one inch, cover the others respectively with mulches (one inch 
deep) of leaves, dry sand, and dust from under the house. As soon as 
prepared, and again after a few days, weigh all cans and see how much 
water each has lost, so as to learn which best retains the moisture in 
the lower layer of soil. See also Crosby’s Exercises 42 and 44.

  SECTION XIII. TERRACING AND DRAINING 
AFTER a heavy rainfall the water in the ditches aad the 
furrows is muddy. This mud is soil—the best kind of 
soil, too — that the currents of water have washed away. 
  
  Fic. 48.—A FIELD RUINED BY WASHES

soil, but in low places where much water collects and

fine gravel are torn loose and hurried along. The re- 
moval of the soil leaves a wash or scar in the field. Every 
rain repeats the process, so that in time a gully or ditch 
deep enough to hide a horse and rider is formed. Soon 
the water in each row that crosses this wash cuts a little 
channel down to the main gully and, in time, the field be- 
comes unfit for cultivation (Fig. 48). If the first break is 
mended the field will continue to produce good crops 
instead of becoming worthless. The old saying that “a 
stitch in time saves nine” is very true in preventing the 
washing away of the soil. 
Terracing. — Most hillsides in this climate tend to wash 
if cultivated. Terracing is a system of protecting hillsides 
against washing. A terrace is a low bank or ridge, winding 
around a hill or slope, but always maintaining nearly a 
perfect level. To keep ona level the terrace often has to 
wind about with many an inconvenient curve and crook. 
When the top of a terrace is kept even and level, it re- 
duces the amount of washing. The level top-line permits 
the water to run over the top of the terrace bank along

How a terrace is made. — By means of either a terracing 
level, or a home-made terracing triangle (Fig. 51), a curving 
line is marked out near the top of the hillside by placing 
stakes at intervals of about ten steps, all of the stakes being 
on the same level. In the same way stake the next terrace 
line at a vertical distance of three feet lower down the hill 
on gentle slopes, or five feet lower on very steep slopes. 
Repeat the operation until all the terraces are staked out. 
Now mark each line of stakes by means of a furrow, not 
passing exactly under the stakes but very near them, try- 
ing to make the curves in the terrace as slight and gradual

as possible. Below this furrow leave a strip of hard, un- 
broken ground of about two feet wide. On this throw 
furrows from above and below, forming a slight ridge or 
bank. If at first this bank is not level or not high enough, 
the work must be completed with shovel and hoe. 
A terrace on sandy, porous soil will hold back all the 
water that falls except during and after very heavy rains. 
Deep plowing will aid terraces to do this and will often 
keep them from breaking, even after heavy downpours. 
Breaks, however, will sometimes occur, especially before

weeds and grass have covered the terrace and bound it to- 
gether with their roots. Such breaks should be mended 
promptly, using neither logs, stones, nor trash, but soil 
taken from just below the terrace and some distance from 
the break. 
A crop of cowpeas or cotton on the terrace bank keeps 
the field much neater and more free from weeds. Terraces 
may be covered with some winter-growing plant, the 
living roots of which strengthen them in winter. Among 
the best plants for this purpose are bur clover, vetch, or 
Texas blue-grass,

Terraces often inconvenient, but necessary. — Terraces 
decrease washing, but make many short 
cost of cultivation, and interfere with the use of improved 
implements. They are needed only in hilly regions. In 
Virginia and Tennessee and northward they are seldom 
used, partly because wheat or oats, pasture or hay plants, 
alternate with hoed crops and the fields are not cultivated 
so continuously as in the cotton belt. | ws, increase the

or where water 
stands ina post hole within several feet of the surface, dur-

hill lands of the Gulf and South Atlantic states needs little 
or no artificial drainage except that intended to prevent 
washing. On bottom land and on some very stiff or seepy 
upland fields, however, drainage is generally needed. 
Drainage makes roots go deeper into the soil. — While 
the purpose of terracing is to cause porous soils to absorb 
most of the water that falls on them, in order to prevent 
washing, the object of drainage is to remo 
water from soils that otherwise would hold

TERRACING AND DRAINING 79 
penetrate farther, and in drained soils therefore plant roots 
are deeper than in soil that has ordinarily been saturated. 
When the upper soil dries, the shallow-rooted plants in 
undrained lands are no longer able to obtain moisture ; 
but the deep-rooted plants in drained soil, being nearer the 
ever moist subsoil, are uninjured. 
Other benefits from drainage.— Drainage makes soils 
more crumbly and less inclined to be cloddy. It increases 
in the soil the number of helpful germs, or tiny living 
plants, that change vegetable matter into available plant- 
food. This it does by supplying an abundance of air, with- 
out which they cannot live. Moreover, drainage makes the 
land ready for plowing earlier. Plants start to grow earlier 
on drained than on wet soil, for drainage warms the soil 
by drawing off a part of the water that would otherwise 
evaporate, and which, in evaporating, would cool the soil. 
Two classes of drains. — The usual drain is an open ditch. 
Another kind is the covered or underdrain. A field in 
which there are underdrains shows no sign of them, for they 
are two to four feet below the surface and completely 
covered over. One of their advantages over open ditches 
is that crops can be grown above the drains. 
Underdrains. — These are usually made of tiles, which are 
hollow tubes of burnt clay one foot long, laid end to end. 
The water runs into them at the joints, which do not fit 
together tightly, and trickles in through the porous walls 
(Figs. 52, 53). Sometimes underdrains are made of four 
narrow planks nailed together like a long box, with 
numerous holes for water to enter. In other cases they 
are made of three large poles in a triangular pile, and

sometimes of old bricks or stones. Although these are 
buried several feet in the ground, ie flows down to 
them, thus deepening and airing the soil. They usually

drain the soil more completely and to greater depth 
than do ordinary open ditches. 
Open ditches. — According to their use, the principal 
kinds of open ditches are : — 
1. Canals, or very large ditches. 
2. Deep drainage ditches. 
3. Hillside ditches (usually shallow ditches). 
The water in open ditches often carries much mud and 
other fine material. When the current is rapid, this soil 
material is carried onward by the water, and is not depos- 
ited. But if any part of the ditch is less steep than the 
portion above it, the water must necessarily travel more 
slowly. A sand-bar generally forms where the current is 
thus checked, for the slower current is unable to carry its       
     
-P-A-G-E-91
TERRACING AND DRAINING 81 
burden of*fine sand and other soil particles. These are 
thrown down and fill the ditch, making work for the farmer 
in opening it again. The banks of a deep open ditch 
should not be upright nor nearly upright, for they invari- 
ably cave in, and the earth fills the ditch. 
It is a good rule for a ditch to have a uniform grade, 
steep enough to carry off the water without filling the 
ditch with soil, and yet not so steep that the current will 
cut deep into the bottom of the ditch. This grade varies 
with the dimensions of the ditch, as you will learn in larger 
books on drainage. For small ditches there is usually 
from three to five inches of fall in every one hundred feet. 
EXERCISE. — Walk over a field and notice the little washes just be- 
ginning. Think of a way by which each one could be stopped. When 
a ditch or river makes a sand-bar at a curve, is the sand-bar on the 
inner or on the outer side of curve? Why? Watch a winding brook as 
it flows and learn why a ditch or river tends to become more and more 
crooked (Fig. 40). Look at one of the ditches on a farm that you 
Frow and plan how it could be improved. 
NoTE TO THE TEACHER. —If a rain occurs soon after this lesson 
has been studied, point out that the current is strong and washing is 
possible only in those places on the school yard or an adjoining field 
where water collects, and not where it is spread in a thin sheet. - Does 
washing occur on the bare or on the grass-covered parts of the school 
yard? Perhaps some pupil’s father has a drainage-level and will bring 
it to school and show the class how to use it. If he will lend it, the 
directions above will be sufficient guide for you to use it in locating 
terrace lines. Why not havea short excursion for using the level and 
for inspecting ditches and streams? 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
SECTION XIV. HOW THE SOIL BECOMES 
POOR 
SurFACE washing is one of the means by which land 
becomes poor, and it is one that can be prevented by 
proper use of ditches and terraces and by better methods 
of farming. If any fields are so steep that terraces or 
ditches will not protect them against surface washing, they 
should be allowed to grow up in useful trees. Otherwise 
they should be planted to some grass or grazing plant, the 
matted roots of which will do much to hold the soil in 
place. Bermuda grass is one of the best of these soil- 
binding plants. When this is not wanted, other grasses 
or clovers can be used instead. 
Leaching. — On all soils there is a loss of fertility that 
cannot be seen and is often not suspected. This is leach- 
ing or the dissolving of plant-food by the rain water and 
the draining of this water and of the dissolved plant-food 
in it through the soil, and into the streams. This loss 
is greater than any other in our Southern climate. It 
occurs chiefly during the winter, when rains are heaviest 
and when there are no living roots to use the soluble 
plant-food. It can be prevented by causing living plants 
to occupy the fields during the winter. Wheat, rye, crim- 
son clover, or any other plants in active growth during the 
winter send their roots throughout the soil. These roots 
82
-P-A-G-E-93
  HOW THE SOIL BECOMES POOR 83 
absorb the soluble plant-food, leaving very little that can 
be dissolved by the rain water as it drains through the soil. 
Even weeds that keep green during the winter do this 
much good. 
Loss of vegetable matter. — Another cause responsible 
for much of the poor soil in the South is the loss of vege- 
table matter. This occurs whenever the farmer grows 
corn, cotton, or any other crop that is kept thoroughly 
cultivated, and does not leave on the land a large amount 
of roots, leaves, or stems. Fire is one of the farmer’s 
worst enemies, because it destroys vegetable matter needed 
to improve the soil. 
When vegetable matter in the soil disappears, the soil 
becomes lighter in color, drier in dry weather, more cloddy, 
and harder to work. Clay soils then become too compact 
for roots to thrive in them. In dry weather the crop on 
such land is parched and stunted or ruined, while on simi- 
lar land, well supplied with rotted vegetable matter, the 
crop is much better able to withstand drought. This is 
partly because rotted vegetable matter is somewhat like 
a sponge in having the power to hold moisture. When 
the roots come in contact with this decayed vegetable 
matter, they absorb its moisture and also use a part of it 
tor food. 
The farmer can replace the vegetable matter that dis- 
appears where clean cultivated crops are continually 
grown by producing an occasional crop. that leaves 
large amounts of roots or foliage and stems on the 
ground. Some of the crops that thus increase the sup- 
ply of vegetable matter are the clovers, cowpeas, and kim
-P-A-G-E-94
84 AGRICULTURE 
dred plants, and the grasses that form a sod or dense 
covering over the entire surface. The surest and cheapest 
way for the farmer to cnrich his land and to make 
larger profits in farming is by constantly adding vege- 
table matter. 
Sale of plant-food in crops. —If a farmer every year 
hauls crops of grain, or hay, or potatoes from his field with- 
out putting anything back, there will come a time when he 
will say that the field is too poor to cultivate. Crops differ 
greatly in the kind and amount of plant-food they remove 
from the soil. The lint of cotton and the sugar of sugar 
cane consist almost entirely of materials drawn from the 
air, and so these products remove almost no plant-food. 
Yet cotton may make the soil poorer because its clean cul- 
tivation causes the loss of vegetable matter; because its 
seed removes considerable plant-food; and most of all, 
because it leaves the land without living roots during the 
winter, and thus permits the rain to leach and to rob the 
soil. Sugarcane may be an exhausting crop because the 
stalks that are carried trom the field contain much plant- 
food and because the leaves are generally burned. This 
does not mean that exhausting crops should not be grown, 
but that something must be returned to the land in exchange 
for what is removed. 
Lack of drainage makes soils unproductive. — All the 
causes of soil-impoverishment mentioned are due to sub- 
stances taken from the soil. They have all been forms 
of subtraction. There is, however, an addition to the 
soil that may make it poor. Too much water injures 
the soil and the crop if it is not drained away either by

NoTE TO THE TEACHER. — Ask your pupils to explain how lye is 
made from ashes kept in hoppers. Point out that this process is § 
Jeaching. Leaching does more harm to rich than to poor soils. This 
process removes from the soil chiefly nitrogen and little or no phosphate . 
and potash. The loss of plant-food due to the sale of lint cotton and 
of cotton seed is shown in Fig. 94.

  SECTION XV. HOW TREES AND LEGUMI- 
NOUS PLANTS IMPROVE THE SOIL 
In a forest, year after year, the trees drop their leaves; 
the decayed leaves and roots make the soil very loose and 
rich. When the trees are removed, the “‘new-ground”’ pro- 
duces good crops that use the vegetable matter as food. 
The crops are good on “new-ground” also, because 
the humus in dry weather holds moisture like a sponge. 
Drought, therefore, is not much felt by crops on land con- 
taining much humus, When plowed, the dark, loose soil 
crumbles readily, for the reason that vegetable matter in 
the soil keeps the particles of clay from sticking together 
and from turning up in great useless clods. 
Resting land not the quickest way to enrich it.— Farm. 
ers have learned that even a crop of weeds adds vegetable 
matter, and so they sometimes leave certain poor fields 
uncultivated for a year or two to “rest” or improve. 
Such improvement of the land is slow under any conditions. 
Making land fertile by growing certain crops. — Differ- 
ent plants are very unlike in the value of the vegetable 
matter they add to the soil. Those that make the best 
fertilizer are the plants rich in nitrogen. Look carefully 
at the picture (Fig. 106) and notice how much more corn 
grew on a square yard where vetch plants had grown the 
year before. Twice as large a crop of oats, wheat, or hay has

are all closely akin. The clovers, cowpeas, vetches, and 
similar plants belong to the bean family. Legumes, or 
leguminous plants, is the name given to them. All of.the 
legumes the farmer makes use of have flowers shaped like 
the flower of the garden pea, sweet-pea, and cowpea. . The
-P-A-G-E-98
  88 AGRICULTURE 
flower of each of these consists of (1) a broad petal 
standing up somewhat like the wings of a butterfly at 
rest, (2) a folded portion that reminds us of the butter- 
fly’s body, and (3) a petal standing up straight and alone 
on each side of the folded part. The leaves of common 
leguminous plants are com- 
pound, that is, made up of 
several smaller parts called 
leaflets (Fig. 55). The seeds 
are in pods that split along 
both edges when ripe. 
You will quickly see that 
garden peas, cowpeas, sweet- 
peas, locust trees, and some 
plants called weeds have 
blossoms of thisshape. The 
clovers have very different 
heads, more like the shape 
of the end ofafinger. Each 
clover head is not a single 
flower, however, but a mass 
of dozens of tiny flowers. 
Each of the little flowers 
has the same general shape as the pea blossom. Plants 
on which the flowers are of this shape are found to make 
the soilricher. These plants have bean-like pods (Fig. 59). 
Tubercles or nodules on the roots of legumes. — Care- 
fully dig up cowpea, clover, and other legumes without 
stripping off the smaller roots. Do you not find little 
round or pear-shaped knots attached to the roots? This

are at work making the soil rich. These knots are root 
tubercles or root nodules (Figs. 56, 57). 
The farmer’s tiny helpers. — Each tubercle is a busy
-P-A-G-E-100
  90 AGRICULTURE 
workshop inhabited by multitudes of germs, so small that 
25,000 of them could be placed side by side on a line une 
inch long. These germs are actively at work helping the 
farmer. The tubercle in which they live serves as a house 
for them. It is really a fertilizer factory, and the germs 
are the workmen, busy making fertilizer that will be 
used by the plant on the roots of which the tubercle 
grows. The plant on which the tubercle forms is called 
the host plant. It furnishes the germs in the tubercle 
with starchy food made by the leaves. In exchange the 
tubercles send up through the sap a fertilizer rich in 
nitrogen. This fertilizer nitrogen is constantly being 
made by the germs in the tubercle from the nitrogen gas 
in the air. The farmer can help the germs to manu- 
facture fertilizer nitrogen by plowing the land before sow- 
ing legumes. Plowing or cultivation permits an abundance 
of air, with the nitrogen gas which it contains, to pass 
through the loose soil to the tubercle, where the tiny 
workmen are ready to use it for the farmer’s benefit. 
What the cowpea or clover plant does with nitrogen. — 
Let us consider what becomes of the nitrogen a tubercle 
sends up in the sap current to the cowpea or clover plant 
on which it is growing. <A part of it is deposited in the 
roots of the cowpea, another part in the stem, another 
portion goes to make the leaves, and still another part 
helps to make the seeds. All clovers and most other 
legumes use their fertilizer nitrogen manufactured in the 
tubercles just as the cowpea does, and they enrich the 
soil in the same way. 
Even if the farmer mows and hauls away the vines for
-P-A-G-E-101
  
HOW TREES AND PLANTS IMPROVE THE LAND QI 
hay, there is still left in the land the nitrogen that was 
stored in the roots and lower part of the stem and in the 
fallen leaves. Even the roots and stubble of legumes, 
therefore, can enrich the land, both.in nitrogen and in 
vegetable matter. The enrichment is much greater if the

tops, as well as the roots, are plowed into the soil, either 
as soon as growth is finished or after being eaten by+ 
animals pasturing on the field. 
Shall the tops of soil-improving plants be plowed into 
the ground? — The plants that most enrich the land are 
those that make the richest hay and pasturage for horses, 
cattle, sheep, hogs, and poultry. The farmer often asks, 
“Does it pay better to use the vines or tops of cowpeas 
or clover as food for live-stock or to plow them into the   
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  92 AGRICULTURE 
ground as fertilizer?’” The best answer is that letting 
these crops pass through an animal does not greatly lessen 
their value as fertilizer. The starch, sugar, and fat that the 
animal takes out of its food have no value as a fertilizer. 
Enough live-stock ought to be kept on all farms to con- 
sume the legumes that are grown. The farmer can, there- 
fore, make a double use of the leguminous crops: he can 
use them as stock-food, and later for fertilizer. The roots 
and stubble of legumes enrich the land. The little fertilizer 
factories on the roots of leguminous plants are worth more 
to mankind than all the gold in the whole world. Nearly 
every farm that to-day is too poor to keep the farmer’s 
family in comfort can be made fertile by the wise use of 
cowpeas, crimson clover, and related legumes.

SECTION XVI. BARNYARD MANURE 
A FARM with many animals is generally rich and produc 
tive because of the supply of manure. Experience in all 
countries shows that this material is an excellent means 
for enriching all kinds of soil. Some chemical fertilizers, 
however, are beneficial only on certain soils. 
Manure has these good effects: (1) It makes the earth 
loose and mellow, allowing the roots and air to come into 
contact with all parts of the soil. (2) After it has rotted, 
it enables the soil to hold moisture in dry weather. (3) It 
furnishes plant-food to the roots of growing crops. (4) It 
adds needed germs and causes the beneficial ones already 
in the soil to thrive and multiply, thus helping the crop. 
Richest manure from richest food. — Barnyard manure 
is composed largely of ground-up parts of plants, and con- 
tains very nearly what the plants contained. The richest 
is made by feeding cotton-seed meal and other foods rich 
in nitrogen. Hay from cowpeas and other legumes makes 
better manure than that from shucks, straw, or grass. 
Fertilizing crops by buying food for live-stock.— A 
farmer may buy 100 pounds of cotton-seed meal and place 
it in the ground as fertilizer. It would pay him better first 
to feed it to cattle and then to use the manure. [If all of 
this, solid and liquid, were carefully saved, it would have 
the same value as a fertilizer as 80 pounds of cotton-seed 
93 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
94 AGRICULTURE 
meal. Animals take from the food fed them chiefly those 
substances that are worthless as fertilizers, such as starch 
and fat. The farmer, therefore, who buys cotton-seed meal 
to use as a fertilizer for his crop can make two profits by 
first feeding it and then using the manure as fertilizer. 
Any pasture or field can be 
  
made rich by keeping on it 
live-stock that is fed partly on 
‘purchased food or food grown     
    
          
  
on other parts of the farm. 
The manure from different 
animals is different in fertiliz- 
ing value largely because 
a IS i they are fed on different 
foods. Manure from the 
poultry house is several tinies 
more valuable than any other. 
When only the solid waste 
from animals is saved, the

over it, the rain water de- 
stroys much of the fertilizing value. Manure that has been 
exposed to rain for a number of months is sometimes worth 
less than half as much for fertilizing crops as it was at 
first. Most of the plant-food has been dissolved and 
carried off by water; some of the nitrogen has changed 
into ammonia and passed off into the air as a strong-smell- 
ing gas; and a large part of the soil-loosening material 
     
-P-A-G-E-105
  BARNYARD MANURE 95 
nas disappeared or been slowly “ burned,” for rotting is a 
kind of slow burning. A roof over the manure pile pre- 
vents the great loss caused by water, but the other losses 
go on even with the roof. The best plan, therefore, is to 
put manure into the ground as soon as possible and before 
any waste has occurred. 
Composts. — Compost heaps are piles of manure mixed 
with other materials, such as leaves or cotton seed, with 
sometimes phosphate added. Partial rotting makes the 
manure less coarse and makes it act more quickly on the 
crop. The same materials can be mixed in the furrow in 
the field. When they rot there, the soil prevents loss. 
Moreover, when organic matter rots in the soil, it causes 
the soil touching’ it to “rot” too, that is, to change some 
of its compounds into substances that plants can use as 
food. It is generally best to plow manure under so that 
the soil will absorb the ammonia that might otherwise be 
lost. 
Barnyard manure is dilute. The farmer must get it to 
the field with as little labor as possible, for fully three fourths 
of its weight is water, that has no value. Large amounts 
must be used on an acre. In a ton of manure there are 
only about 25 to 35 pounds of the three precious forms of 
plant-food (nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash), or about 
as much as in 200 pounds of a high-grade complete com- 
mercial fertilizer. The plant-food in a ton of manure could 
generally be bought in the form of commercial fertilizers 
for between $1.50 and $3. But a ton of manure contains, 
besides direct plant-food, billions of helpful germs and 
about a quarter of a ton of organic matter that is very 
 
-P-A-G-E-106

beneficial in making the soil mellow and able to hold mois 
ture. These cannot be bought in commercial fertilizers. 
which increase the crops chiefly in the year in which they 
are used. Stable manure makes the soil richer for 2 
number of years.

Soms have abundance of all necessary plant-food 
materials except nitrogen, phosphates, potash, and lime, 
which may be deficient in some lands. When one cr 
more of these valuable forms of plant-food is deficient, 
poor crops result unless 
something containing che 
element wanted is added. 
The lack of even a 
single one of these pre- 
cious substances, or 
forms of plant-food, will 
cause the crop to be 
‘about as poor as if all Fic. 62.— Grass Hay rrom EQuaL AREAS

  four of them were de-

to find out which of these is wanting, and to use on each 
field a fertilizer that contains just the kind of plant-food 
that is needed in that soil. Plants, if denied nitrogen or 
phosphates, but given an abundance of everything else 
needed, would die. 
Nitrogen and ammonia. — Commercial fertilizers (so 
named from the word commerce, meaning trade) are those 
prepared and furnished by merchants or manufacturers. 
When they contain only nitrogen, they are called nitroge- 
H 97
-P-A-G-E-108
  98 AGRICULTURE 
nous fertilizers. The most important commercial ferti- 
lizers that are rich in nitrogen are cotton-seed meal and 
nitrate of soda. If nitrogen occurs in mixtures with other 
precious plant-foods, the fertilizer may be called an am- 
moniated fertilizer, or “guano.” Ammonia is a combination 
of fourteen parts by weight of nitrogen with three parts

the most precious of plant-foods, may become seventeen 
pounds of ammonia. Hence, if there is printed on a bag

ing the amount of 
nitrogen by 17 and dividing the product by 14. On the 
other hand, if the printing on the bag shows that cotton- 
seed meal contains eight and one-half per cent of ammonia, 
change this to nitrogen by dividing by 17 and multiplying 
by 14. The amount of ammonia is always larger, because 
it contains all the nitrogen and another element besides. 
Cotton-seed meal. —Cotton-seed meal is a yellowish, 
powdery material made from the kernels of cotton seed 
after removing most of the oiland hulls. Cotton-seed meal 
is more than twice as rich in nitrogen as the whole cotton 
seed from which it is made. 
Cotton-seed meal usually contains between six and seven 
pounds of nitrogen in each hundred pounds of meal and 
is therefore expensive. It also contains some phosphate
-P-A-G-E-109
  COMMERCIAL FERTILIZERS 99 
and potash. There are several grades of this meal. those 
that contain the largest proportion of hulls being the least 
valuable. This meal cannot be used by plants until it has 
decayed. It is more. suitable, therefore, for crops that 
occupy the land in the warm weather than for very early 
crops which make their growth in cool weather. 
Nitrate of soda.— Nitrate of soda is a fertilizer with 
more than twice as much nitrogen as cotton-seed meal. 
It costs more than twice as 
much per ton, but does not 
need to be used in such large 
amounts. It is brought by 
ships from South America, 
for in that hot country the 
nitrogen has already been 
changed into the form of 
a nitrate, ready to be used 
by plants at once. 
When nitrate of soda is 
sown broadcast on the sur- 
face of the ground where 
  young wheat or oat plants 
are growing, the moisture of 
the soil dissolves the ferti- 
lizer and carries it down- 
ward to the roots of plants. Fic. 64.— Corn From EQuaL AREAS

Within a week after this fertilizer is sown, wheat and oat 
plants become much greener and more luxuriant. It is 
especially suitable for plants that make their growth 
during the cool months (wheat, oats, etc.) and for vege

tables, like lettuce and radishes, in which quick growth is 
desired. 
Three kinds of phosphates. — Phosphates are those fer- 
tilizers that contain the element phosphorus, in the form 
of phosphoric acid. There are three kinds of phosphate, 
that are of very different value. The first is natural or 
raw phosphate, sometimes called Tennessee phosphate, 
Florida phosphate, or floats. It is simply the phosphate 
rock just as it is dug or brought up by dredges from its 
place in phosphate beds, except that it has been ground 
into a very fine powder. Since roots generally cannot 
absorb much of this form of phosphate because it will not 
dissolve in pure water, it is called insoluble phosphate. 
Acid phosphate is so called because it is made by ad- 
ding sulfuric acid to the raw or natural phosphate. This 
acid so changes the phosphate that roots can immediately 
absorb it. The phosphate in acid phosphate is called 
soluble. There is a third or intermediate form that plants 
can use. This and the soluble phosphate are added to- 
gether and called the available phosphoric, that is, the kind 
that plants can use promptly. 
Acid phosphate usually contains from 12 to 16 per 
cent of available phosphoric acid, that is from 24 to 32 
pounds of available phosphoric acid in every 200-pound 
bag. The farmer can afford to pay fully one third more 
for the acid phosphate with 16 per cent than for that with 
only 12 per cent of available plant-food. He will need 
less of the high-grade than of the low-grade fertilizer, and 
thus will save freight and expense of hauling and handling. 
Although raw or. crude phosphate cannot be dissolved 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  : COMMERCIAL FERTILIZERS 10L 
in pure water and cannot be used immediately by the roots, 
nevertheless it has some value as fertilizer for some soils 
and crops. When raw phosphate is kept for some time 
in contact with decaying vegetable matter or mixed with 
manure, a part of its phosphate changes into a form which 
roots can use. 
Fertilizers containing potash. — The commonest of these 
is kainit. It is dug from deep mines in Germany. It 
contains about twelve per cent of potash. Muriate of pot- 
ash is obtained from the same source. About half its 
weight, or fifty per cent, is potash. Kainit and muriate of 
potash are nearly white, resembling somewhat coarse 
table salt. 
EXERCISE. — Try to get samples of as many as possible of the fer- 
tilizers mentioned above for the teacher to show during class. In your 
notebook describe them. Be ready to report the effects of any fertilizer 
test you may know about. 
Nore TO THE TEACHER. — If possible, exhibit small samples of any 
of the fertilizers mentioned in the lesson. Which ones dissolve quickly ? 
Which ones get lumpy? Exhibition of ordinary mixed or manufactured 
fertilizers will be of doubtful profit to the class, and may involve per- 
sonal interests.

  SECTION XVIII. CALCULATING FERTILIZER 
FORMULAS 
FERTILIZERS are sometimes spoken of as chemicals. 
Those made by mixing any two such chemicals are called 
mixed, manufactured, or manipulated fertilizers. The laws 
of most states require that there shall be printed on the out- 
side of each bag of fertilizer a statement showing the per- 
centage of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash it contains. 
No fertilizer should be bought until the buyer has calcu- 
lated its commercial value from these figures on the bag, 
using the method shown on page 103. After he has 
calculated the commercial value, he should compare this 
figure with the cash price asked by the seller. The two 
figures should differ by only enough to pay the dealer a 
fair profit and the cost of freight. 
The commercial value of a pound of nitrogen, phosphoric 
acid, and potash is the average wholesale selling price of 
these substances in the largest fertilizer markets. Chemists 
average these prices every year, and publish the figures as 
the commercial values for that year. Generally the com- 
mercial value is about 15 cents per pound of nitrogen, 5 
cents per pound of available phosphoric acid, and 5 cents 
per pound of potash. 
How to calculate the commercial value. — Multiply the 
prices given above by the number of pounds of nitrogen, 
available phosphoric acid, and potash respectively in a ton 
102
-P-A-G-E-113
  READY-MIXED FERTILIZER 103 
of the fertilizer. Add the products; the sum is the com- 
mercial value of the fertilizer. 
EXAMPLE. — What is the commercial value of one ton of complete 
fertilizer which the printing on the bags guarantees to contain 1.65 per 
cent of nitrogen, 10 per cent of available phosphoric acid, and 2 per cent 
of potash?

$16.95 
The above calculation shows a commercial value of $16.95 when 
nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash have the prices of 15, 5, and 5 
cents a pound respectively.t 
If the cash price asked by the dealer is many dollars per 
ton above the estimated commercial value for that year, 
acalculation should be made to learn what it would cost 
for the farmer to make his own fertilizer by mixing together 
acid phosphate, cotton-seed meal, and kainit, or other 
chemicals. 
EXAMPLE. — What will it cost to make a home-mixed fertilizer, having 
the same composition as the fertilizer given in the table, with cotton-seed 
meal at $22 per ton, acid phosphate (with 16 per cent available phos- 
phoric acid) at $15 per ton, and kainit at $14 per ton? The price 
asked for the ready-mixed fertilizer is $21 per ton. How much meal, 
phosphate, and kainit must be mixed in order to obtain an equivalent, 
but less expensive, fertilizer? 
1 These figures will answer for practice. To get the exact prices of nitro- 
gen, phosphoric acid, and potash for any particular year, write to the State 
Commissioner of Agriculture at the state capital.

  First find how much cotton-seed meal is needed to afford 33 pounds 
of nitrogen. The table on page 106 gives the per cert of nitrogen in 
cotton-seed meal as 6}; this means that each hundredweight of meal 
contains 6} lb. of nitrogen. Evidently to supply 33 lb. of nitrogen, as 
many hundredweight of meal are needed as 6} is contained times in 33. 
Thus 33 + 6} = 5.07 cwt., or 507 lbs., of cotton-seed meal are needed. 
Next find how much phosphoric acid and potash this amount of meal 
will supply. From the tables below it is seen that 1 cwt. of cotton-seed 
meal contains 2.8 lbs. of phosphoric acid ; therefore, 5.07 cwt. contain 
(5.07 x 2.8) 14.196 lbs. Likewise for potash, 5.07 cwt. cotton-seed 
meal contain 5.07 x 1.8 = 10.126 Ibs. of potash.

dently as many hundred as 16 is contained times in 185.8. Thus, 
185.8 + 16 = 11.61 cwt., or 1161 Ibs. of acid phosphate are required. 
Calculate how many pounds of kainit to use.

Fillers in fertilizers. — A full ton of the mixture is not 
always needed to afford the desired amount of plant-food. 
If a full ton having the given percentage composition is 
wanted, add the necessary amount of some worthless mate- 
rial, such as ground stone or cinders. Such worthless addi- 
tions to fertilizers are called filers. If manufacturers add 
them it is for the purpose of making a fertilizer that they 
can afford to sell at a low price. To avoid buying and 
hauling useless filler, use only the highest grades of manu- 
factured fertilizers. These are higher in price, but gener- 
ally furnish nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash at ‘a 
lower cost per pound than do low-grade, cheap fertilizers. 
In choosing fertilizers, select that one in which a pound of 
plant-food costs the least.

  SECTION XIX. SUITING THE FERTILIZERS 
TO THE SOIL 
Tue amount of fertilizer per acre varies with the land 
and with the crop. Vegetables and cotton generally pay 
better for large amounts of fertilizer than does corn. For 
cotton, many farmers use only 200 pounds per acre. Good 
farmers often use 400 to 600 pounds. Growers of vege- 
tables increase this to as much as one half or one ton 
of commercial fertilizer per acre. As labor and land 
become scarcer or higher it pays to increase the amount 
of fertilizer. Some land may be too poor for very 
large amounts of fertilizer to be very profitable. This is 
because a poor soil may be so shallow or so deficient 
in vegetable matter that in dry weather it can hold just 
enough water to make good use of only 300 pounds of 
fertilizer per acre. When this same soil is made deeper 
and supplied with vegetable matter, it may hold enough 
moisture to use profitably double this amount. 
Experienced farmers often apply more phosphate than 
the crop will remove from the land because the clay or 
iron in the soil changes some of it into a form that plants 
cannot use. This cannot be prevented and fortunately 
phosphate is not very expensive. Nitrogen, however, is 
about three times as expensive as phosphoric acid, hence 
108
-P-A-G-E-119
  SUITING THE FERTILIZERS TO THE SOIL 109 
more of this than the plant requires is not applied. For 
fields where soil-improving crops have grown and on stock- 
farms, often there is no 
need to buy any nitrogen, 
or very little at the most. 
The agricultural value of 
a fertilizer.—The agricul- 
tural value of a fertilizer is 
the value of the increase 
in the crop caused by using 
the fertilizer. 
Suiting the fertilizer to 
the crop.— Different plants 
require different kinds of 
fertilizer. ‘Since legumi- 
nous plants get nitrogen 
from the air by the work 
of their root tubercles they 
generally do not need nitro- 
gen. To add a fertilizer 
containing nitrogen is 
therefore a useless expense. 
Suiting the fertilizer to 
the soil.— What a soil 
needs cannot be told by 
looking at it. There are, 
however, some helpful 
rules.   
    Fic. 68. —SoRGHUM FROM EQuaL AREAS 
On left, no nitrogen in the fertilizer; on 
right, fertilized with nitrate of soda. 
Generally, a soil that is black or very dark con- 
tains much vegetable matter, which in turn contains much 
nitrogen, On the other hand, if the stalks of crops cul- 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  110 AGRICULTURE 
tivated on a field are small, there is. probably need 
of nitrogen in the soil. A crop of cowpeas or clover 
usually leaves the soil rich in nitrogen. Clay soils gener- 
ally contain more potash than sandy soils. Whether a 
soil is rich in phosphoric acid cannot be told by looking 
at it. 
How to find what fertilizer the soil needs.— Even when 
a chemist analyzes soil and finds out just what it contains, 
  
  Fic. 69. WHEAT FROM EQuaL AREAS 
On left, fertilized with nitrate of soda; on right, no nitrogen in the fertilizer. 
he cannot tell how much of every precious element is in a 
condition for plants to use. The chemist’s analysis does 
not, therefore, show what fertilizer to apply. 
The only way to determine the kind of fertilizer a soil 
needs is to make an experiment on that soil with different 
fertilizers. 
It will pay to make this experiment with the principal 
‘crop of any farm. The following diagram shows how to 
make such a test. The areas must be of exactly the same

The plots must be on the same kind of soil and equally 
well drained. If it is not convenient to harvest the crop 
separately on so many plots, use only plots 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 
Fertilizers that do not work well together. —Two ferti- 
.lizers that must not be mixed are lime and phosphate. 
The lime changes the phosphate into a less soluble form 
and thus reduces its value as a fertilizer. Now, ashes 
contain much lime; therefore ashes and phosphate should 
not be used together. 
EXERCISE. — Learn from a farmer in the neighborhood, or from the 
printing on fertilizer sacks, the composition of the fertilizer most.used in 
your neighborhood. Is it used on all sorts of soils? If it suits poor 
clay soils, is it apt to be the best for sandy land? By making the 
fertilizer experiment described in this Section, you may be able to in- 
crease greatly the profits of some farm the next year. 
NOTE TO THE TEACHER. — The calculation of the commercial values 
of fertilizers and practice in calculating fertilizer formulas of definite 
composition should be continued,

SECTION XX. LIME 
CHALK is one form of lime. Another form is quicklime, 
which consists of large lumps, from which bricklayers 
make their mortar. If a bricklayer pours only a small 
amount of water on a lump of quicklime, the lump absorbs 
the water and falls into a powder. This lime that has 
been slacked or changed into a powder by water is the 
form generally used when the farmer employs lime as a 
fertilizer. He buys the quicklime and lets it slack or 
absorb water after it reaches the farm. 
Lime overcomes sourness of soils. — All of these forms 
of lime are alkaline, that is, the opposite of acid. Quick- 
lime is more alkaline than the other kinds of lime and 
fresh-slacked lime ranks next. If either of these forms of 
lime is placed in contact with an acid, the lime unites with 
the acid and by forming a substance different from either, 
that is, neither alkaline nor acid, it destroys the acidity. If, 
therefore, lime is put on sour soil, it unites with the acids 
that made the soil sour, changing them into harmless 
substances. 
' How to know that a soil is sour.— A doctor cannot well 
cure sickness until he determines the nature of the disease. 
When he has done this, he knows what medicines to give. 
Likewise it is important for the farmer to know the condi- 
tion of his soil. If sourness is the principal trouble, lime 
will aid some crops to grow much better on this soil. To 
Il2 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
  LIME 113 
test soil for sourness or acidity strips of blue litmus paper 
are used (purchase at drug store). Acid turns the paper 
pink or red. Since the acid in a sour soil is weak, it will 
change the color of blue litmus paper not to red, but to 
pink. 
Cut a slit with a knife in the moist soil to be tested and 
place the blue paper in this slit. Press the damp soil 
against both sides of the paper for about two minutes. If 
the paper becomes pink where it has been moistened by 
the earth, the soil is acid. The deeper or redder the color, 
the more acid is the soil. 
Large areas of acid soils in the South. — In regions where 
the long-leaf or yellow pine is the principal forest tree, 
much acid soil is usually found, especially in the low 
places. Farther from the coast sandy soils are sometimes 
found to be acid even on the tops of mountain plateaus. 
Spots of poorly drained bottom lands, known as “crawfish 
land,” are often sour. 
Some plants are able to grow in a slightly acid soil. — 
Fortunately for the farmer who has acid soil, many useful

plants grow fairly well in such land. Some of the crops 
that can endure slight acidity of the soil are cotton, corn, 
cowpeas, and watermelons (Fig. 70). It may not pay to 
I
-P-A-G-E-124
114 AGRICULTURE 
buy lime for these. There are other plants, however, which 
will not thrive on a sour soil until lime is applied as a fer- 
tilizing material. Among these are red clover and alfalfa. 
Wheat, peanuts, sorghum, onions, beets, and cabbages 
yield much better when lime is used on a soil that previ. 
ously was acid. 
How to use lime as a fertilizer. — Quicklime (or lump 
lime) must be slacked before being spread. This can be 
done either by pouring water over it while in boxes or in 
the wagon body, or by covering piles of a few bushels of 
quicklime with a layer of damp earth. Within a few days 
or weeks the water in the earth will reduce the lumps of 
lime to powder, and it is then ready to be spread broad- 
cast on the plowed ground and harrowed in. From six ta 
twelve barrels of quicklime (which will occupy much * 
more space and weigh more after slacking) are. used on 
one acre. Lime need not be applied oftener than once in 
three or five years. 
Other uses of lime when added to the soil. — Lime is a 
plant-food. Besides overcoming the acidity of certain 
soils, lime causes the beneficial nitrate-forming germs to 
increase. It is useful also in hastening the rotting of 
vegetable matter, such as leaves or weeds which have been 
plowed under. This rotting must occur before roots can 
use such vegetable matter. 
Lime makes stiff clay soils more porous, and more 
easily worked. Like cultivation, it is a stimulant. It 
changes some of the potash in the soil into a form that 
plants can use. It may cause a poor, sandy soil to become 
exhausted rapidly by putting into crops the little fertility
-P-A-G-E-125
  LIME 115 
that was in it. Tu:s can be avoided by constantly adding 
vegetable matter and necessary plant-food. 
Do not mix lime with barnyard manure or acid phos- 
phate, nor add it to a manure pile or compost heap. It 
rots these materials so rapidly that it drives off into the 
air a part of the nitrogen or ammonia of the manure, 
the loss of which is made known by the strong smell of 
the escaping ammonia gas. A covering of soil over the 
compost pile would absorb and hold the ammonia; hence 
lime in the soil would not do the harm it might when 
mixed above the ground with manures or fertilizers. 
EXERCISE. — If. possible get a lump of builder’s lime; weigh it and 
notice its size; let water drip slowly on it. Again weigh it and notice 
its size. What has happened? 
At this rate a barrel of quicklime weighing 165 pounds wou} | make 
how many pounds of slacked lime? 
NOTE TO THE TEACHER. — It will be worth while to kay from a 
wholesale druggist a 15-cent bottle of blue litmus paper. Obtain in 
addition a bottle of red litmus paper, which is turned Ulue by lime. 
Have pupils test a number of soils with the blue litmus paper, afterwards 
showing to the class the paper used and describing the kind of soil 
found, acid, neutral, or alkaline. Test with blue and red litmus all 
obtainable fertilizers, also salt, soda, various well-waters, etc.

  SECTION XXI.. ROTATION OF CROPS 
RoraTIon means change in some regular order. Rota- 
tion of crops is the exact opposite of the growth of the 
same crop year after year on the same land. It has been 
found that when one kind of plant is grown year after 
year on the same land, the yield decreases. If a different 
kind of crop, peanuts or cowpeas for example, comes in 
between two cotton crops or two wheat crops, the yield of 
the cotton or wheat is greatly increased. The different 
crops ought not only “to take time about” on any one 
field, but should follow each other in a somewhat definite 
order. It is impossible in this limited space to arrange 
tables showing the best order for all crops on the different 
soils. However, some reasons for rotation are given in 
the following pages. 
Rotation to get rid of weeds. — A corn field generally 
contains more grass and weeds than a cotton field, because 
the cultivation of the corn is usually stopped earlier in 
the summer, thus giving grass a chance to spring up. 
Cotton is cultivated so late into the summer that in the 
fall a well-kept cotton field is nearly clean. If a field 
produces several crops of oats or wheat in succession, it 
becomes quite weedy. The wise farmer will grow on that 
field one or two crops of cotton or of some other plant 
that he cultivates very thoroughly, in order to get rid of 
the weeds.

  ROTATION OF CROPS 117 
Rotation to add vegetable matter. — No soil can be kept 
fertile unless vegetable matter is added to it, either by 
the decay of large amounts of plants grown on the land or 
by other means. Place must be made in any rotation for 
an occasional crop that leaves much vegetable matter to be 
plowed under. Such crops are hay plants, which com- 
pletely cover the surface and leave a mass of roots and 
fallen leaves. The stubble of wheat and oats, together 
with the growth of weeds 
that usually follows these 
grains, also affords consider- 
able vegetable matter. 
Rotation to add nitrogen. 
— Plants like cowpeas and 
clovers get nitrogen from 
the air. This nitrogen is 
added to the soil when the 
growth of cowpeas or clover 
is plowed into the land. 
Even the stubble and roots 
of these crops, when plowed 
    under, increase the nitrogen Fic. 72. — TWENTY-FIVE Corn PLANTS

the growing corn plants to improve the soil. Figure 72 
shows that the nitrogen in the stubble of a previous crop 
of vetch, a leguminous plant, increased the yield of corn 
planted as soon as the vetch was cut. 
Another reason for rotating crops is to diversify the 
farm products. The farmer who grows several crops has 
his labor better distributed over the entire year than the 
farmer who grows only one or two crops and is less injured 
if storm, accidents, or low prices cut off his profit on one 
crop. ; 
Rotation to avoid diseases and insect pests. — Every 
cultivated plant has its own special diseases and insect 
enemies that do not attack most other farm crops. Many 
kinds of disease germs and insects remain alive in the 
soil for one or more years, ready to do injury when the 
proper plant is grown on that field. If the plants that 
would be attacked by these pests are kept away from 
that field for a few years, all or most of the germs or 
insects die of starvation. If, however, the plant subject 
to attack is put on the same land again, the pest increases 
and does more and more harm. | 
Examples of rotation.— Rotation must vary with the 
kinds of crops to be grown and with the number of acres 
given to each. Here is a rotation in which about one third 
of the land is to be used for producing cotton : — 
Plant one third of the land in cotton; one third in 
corn, with cowpeas sown later between the corn rows 
(Fig. 73); and one third in oats or wheat, planting cowpeas 
in June after the grain is harvested. This is called a three- 
year rotation, because at the end of three years each

again with the same crop. The cow- 
peas grown between the corn rows fertilize the oats, 
which is the next 
crop. The cow- 
peas planted just 
after the oats are 
cut may. be

peas; and plant cotton every year where oats or wheat 
(and afterwards cowpeas) grew the year before. Study 
the following diagrams until this order of cropping is 
understood. 
Under this rotation the soil bears a soil-improving crop 
two years out of every three and the farm becomes richer 
year by year. A soil-improving crop can be grown every 
year by sowing crimson clover, vetch, or bur clover in 
September among the cotton plants. 
If a farmer wishes half his cultivated area to be in 
cotton, he can easily do this by growing cotton two years 
in succession, changing the three-year to a four-year rota- 
tion. In a four-year rotation each field bears the same 
crop in the fifth year as in the first. The smaller areas 
used for peanuts, sweet potatoes, vetches, sorghum, water- 
melons, and other minor crops are rotated on different 
parts of a single field near the barn, letting crops that add 
nitrogen to the soil rotate with those that do not have 
this power. f 
A good rotation for sugar cane in regions where the 
cane stubble lives through the winter is:—first year, 
corn, with cowpeas grown between for fertilizing the 
cane; second year, sugar cane; third year, or third and 
fourth years, sugar cane from the stubble. In climates 
where a good stand of sugar cane does not spring up 
from the stubble, a rotation for sugar cane is: first 
year, cowpeas or velvet beans; second year, sugar cane. 
In the region just north of the cotton-belt a satisfactory 
rotation is: first year, wheat, among which red clover or 
grass seeds are sown; second year, clover or timothy hay ;

SECTION XXII. CORN 
Corn belongs to the grass family. Some of the plants 
to which it is related are all true grasses, as sugar cane, 
wheat, oats, rye, barley, and rice. Corn differs from most 
of its relatives in having both a tassel and an ear, and in 
having these located on different parts of the plant. 
A corn plant in full tassel gives off a cloud of dust-like 
particles when shaken. There are estimated to be about 
18,000,000 tiny pollen grains formed by each tassel. Most 
of these are wasted, but those that fall on the silks are 
useful. There are as many silks as spaces for grains of 
corn on the ear. 
Races of corn. — There are only a few races of corn, the 
most important being pop, sweet, dent (or common), and 
flint corn. In each race there are many varieties. 
Mixing of races of corn.— Some ears of popcorn have 
some kernels like those of field corn. These have been 
crossed with common corn. Hence popcorn should not 
be planted near other kinds that will tassel at the same 
time. If it is impossible to plant it away from all other 
kinds, arrange the date of planting so as to have it silk 
and tassel before the other corn, or after the tassels on the 
common corn have shed their pollen and dried. Sweet 
corn readily crosses with field corn, and some of its grains 
are then smooth instead of wrinkled, as dry kernels of 
sweet corn ought to be. When these vaces cross, the

character of the grain is generally changed the same year 
that the mixing occurs. 
Varieties of field or dent corn.— There are several hun-

Many of them are Northern

ductive for the Gulf states 
and regions with similar cli-

Henry Grady. In most ex- 
periments in the South varie- 
ties with two medium-sized 
ears have yielded more corn 
than those having a single 
large ear per plant. 
Mixing may not show the 
first year.— There may be a and 
large amount of crossing be- 
tween varieties of common 
corn, and yet the farmer may 
be unable to see it by exam- 
ining the ears. A white va- 
riety may grow beside a yel-

cause crossing between two varieties of dent corn does 
not always change the character of the grains the first 
year. The growing of two varieties of corn close together 
(unless they are planted at such dates as to cause them 
to tassel at different times) should be avoided. 
Corn is a plant easily improved by the method given 
in Section VIII. It is also a plant that quickly becomes 
mixed, and hence inferior, if great care is not taken in the 
  Fic. 78.—SHowinc THREE METHODS OF PLANTING CORN 
selection of seed. Learn the best kind of corn for your 
soil, then keep it pure and improve it. 
Corn roots and the preparation they require.— A corn 
plant may have 20 to 50 roots, many of them as long as 
the plant itself. These, with their branches and root- 
hairs, are always busy taking water from.the soil. Hence 
corn yields best on a soil that is always moist (but not 
wet). It needs land so deeply plowed before planting and 
so well drained that some of its roots can grow deep down 
where there is moisture even when the weather is dry. 
Plow deep in preparing a field, if you can plow early.  
-P-A-G-E-136
126 AGRICULTURE 
Corn is planted either in elevated ridges or beds, in de- 
pressions or water furrows, or in level ground (Fig. 78), 
according to the soil and the farmer’s judgment. Plant 
corn just deep enough to make sure that it will continually 
be in moist soil until germinated. Usually a depth be- 
tween one and three inches is best. 
Distance between plants. The poorer and drier the 
land, the greater must be the distance between plants. 
But land on which corn requires more than three feet 
between plants, in rows five feet apart, is probably too poor 
and dry forcorn. The richer and moister the land, the more 
the plants can be crowded; the rows on some bottom 
lands are only three and a half feet apart. In the South, 
corn is usually planted from the first of March to the 
middle of June. 
Cultivation. — Corn roots are long and near the surface ; 
this shows that cultivation ought to be shallow. Heavy 
rains after planting make some clay lands very compact. 
This causes some farmers to give one deep cultivation 
while the plants are very small. Avoid this unless sure 
that it is necessary, and then make this deep cultivation 
only when the plants are very young. A corn plant six 
inches high may have roots twelve to eighteen inches long. 
Many of them would be cut by deep cultivation. 
It is possible and wise to cultivate corn before it comes 
up. This is done by running a spike-tooth harrow or a 
weeder over the field, either across or along the rows. In 
this way millions of tiny weeds and grass plants are killed 
just after they have come up. This early cultivation also 
forms a loose layer of earth all over the field, which holds
-P-A-G-E-137
CORN 127 
the moisture in the ground, thus making the corn come 
up more completely and quickly and causing the young 
plants to grow more rapidly. This cultivation with the 
weeder can be kept up until the corn plants are several 
inches or even a foot high. One man with a horse or 
mule can thus cultivate 10 to 12 acres in a day. 
In the cotton belt, upland corn is usually thinned to one 
plant in a hill. Corn should be cultivated as soon after 
every rain as the soil is dry enough. A cheap implement 
much used in the South for cultivating corn is the “heel 
scrape.” Various styles of one-horse and two-horse culti- 
vators are used. Cultivation usually ceases before all the 
silks appear. In cultivating corn avoid ridging the land 
very much, because this takes earth from the middle of the 
row and because ridging increases the amount of surface 
that evaporates moisture. 
Fertilizers. — Corn grows best on rich, moist land, and it 
pays better to enrich the land by growing cowpeas or other 
soil-improving plants in previous years than to use large 
amounts of commercial fertilizers. Manure, applied early, 
is the best fertilizing material for corn. When this cannot 
be had, moderate amounts of commercial fertilizers rich in 
nitrogen may be used on land needing fertilizer. A mix- 
ture of 200 pounds of cotton-seed meal and 100 pounds of 
-acid phosphate per acre is often satisfactory. 
Stripping the leaves. — Many farmers in the South strip 
off the corn leaves to obtain “fodder” with which to 
feed their teams. When the farmer strips the green leaves 
from the corn plant he stops the accumulation of carbon, 
the material of which the corn grain chiefly consists. 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
128 AGRICULTURE 
Thus he reduces the yield of corn grain several bushels 
per acre. The same amount of labor employed in making 
hay as in “ pulling fodder” would produce much more food 
for stock. The practice of cutting and shocking the corn 
plants just after most of the shucks have turned brownish 
does not greatly reduce the yield. 
Exercise. — Find ears or even kernels of sweet corn and popcorn, and 
bring these, as well as dent-corn ears, to the class. Write in your note- 
book a description of the shape, size, etc., of grains of each. Examine * 
a corn plant and locate the brace roots. Examine ten ears of corn and 
record in your notebook the number of rows on each. Can you find 
any ear with fifteen rows? Can you discover any law or rule about 
the number of rows? 
Note To THE TEACHER. — Helpful object lessons for this chapter 
are: Dried or fresh corn tassels; unhusked ears of corn with adhering 
silks; ears of sweet, pop, flint, and dent corn, and ears of pop or sweet 
corn with a few dent grains. Corn kernels planted close to the glass 
side of a box (Fig.22) or near the glass inside of a tumbler permit a 
study of corn roots. Keep the glass covered with black paper or 
cloth except when making observations. Washing the soil from the 
roots of a growing corn plant, by the use of a small stream of water 
from an elevated barrel or bucket, will reveal the length and position 
of the roots and thus enforce the lesson of shallow cultivation.
-P-A-G-E-139
  SECTION XXIII. SELECTING OR JUDGING 
SEED-CORN 
By careful selection of seed-corn, five 
bushels or more per acre can be added to 
the usual yield. It pays well, therefore, to 
learn to select or judge corn. It is im- 
portant to select seed from good plants, 
and also from the best ears. 
Selecting the best ear. — On p. 131 is the 
score-card adopted by the corn-growers of 
one state. It gives all the points to be taken 
into consideration in judging corn. Experi- 
ence is needed to bring skill in this. 
GENERAL Directions. Begin with the second 
horizontal line in the table, which is for “shape of 
ear.” Carefully examine the ear to discover whether 
or not the shape is perfect. Among defects may 
be slight crookedness, too much taper, or rows of 
kernels twisting around the cob instead of being 
straight. A shape that is very good may be scored 
“gg”; a perfect shape, Io, is rare. If there are very 
great defects in shape, give it some lower number, say 
“8,” if its only weak point is a moderate twisting 
of the rows of kernels. 
After deciding on the score for each quality, write 
the figure or grade in the proper blank column in the 
table. When all the other qualities have been noted, 
score the first one.

Color of grain and cob.—The color of all kernels on 
the same ear (or on the same set of ears in exhibits at 
fairs) should be the same. 
The color of the cob should not be different from the 
usual color for that variety. White cobs are preferred 
if the grain is white, and red cobs if the grain is yellow. 
The yield, however, is not affected, whether the cob be uni- 
formly white or uniformly red. Cobs of different colors 
in one variety indicate impurity or crossing, and such earg 
should be rejected. 
Vitality or seed condition.— A germination test shows 
the vitality most accurately. However, the appearance of

even, as it should be, the ear will stand erect or vertical. 
An ear with butt much larger than the remainder of the ear, 
or with several extra, short rows of grains, is badly shaped. 
Uniformity of kernels. — Except the grains near the ends 
of the ear, the kernels on one ear and in one variety should 
be nearly similar in shape, size, and de- 
gree of denting on the top. When corn 
is planted by machinery, it is important 
for the grains to be of one size, so that 
the same number may be dropped in each 
hill. 
Shape of kernels. — The grains are 
most compactly arranged when they are 
almost square-shouldered, both at the 
crown or top, and next the cob. A grain 
rounded at the top wastes space and is 
apt to be short. A well-shaped kernel 
is well filled next to the cob, giving room 
for a large germ. The larger the germ, ESTO ee 2 e 
the better. The grain should be large,  fars or Conn 
and it is best when the shape is like 1, grains too short; 2,

Length of ear.— The best length dif- too small; 3, good 
fers for different varieties. If the ears  SP*Pe of kernels. 
are short, the yield is reduced. If they are unusually 
long, there is danger that the ear may not be well covered 
by the shuck. In varieties bearing only one ear to the 
plant, the ear should generally be more than nine inchéslong. 
  Ce
-P-A-G-E-144
  134 AGRICULTURE 
Circumference of ear.— The measure around an ear is 
taken with a tape-line at a point one third the distance from 
the larger end. The usual rule is for the circumference to 
be three fourths the length of the same ear. An ear much 
larger around than this may have too large a cob, and may 
dry out too slowly. A very slender ear 
may have too small a cob, and grains that 
are much too short. 
Space between ‘rows. — If these fur- 
rows are deep and wide, they indicate 
a poorly shaped, round-shouldered kernel. 
Such ears yield a low percentage of 
grain (Fig. 83). 
Space between kernels at cob.— Spaces

Proportion of corn to cob. —- This is determined by shell 
ing the ear (or half the ears in-an exhibit of ten ears), and 
weighing the shelled corn and the cob. The weight of the 
shelled grain is then divided by the weight of cob and 
grain. The quotient gives the ae cent of grain on the 
husked ear. With most highly bred varieties the selected 
ears are expected to show at least 86 or 88 per cent of grain. 
Germination test. — Vacant hills, or poor stands, greatly 
reduce the yield of corn. They are often due to planting
-P-A-G-E-145
    SELECTING OR JUDGING SEED-CORN 135 
ears on which the germs in the grains are dead or injured. 
A very even stand may be obtained by testing between 
moist blotting-paper six grains from every ear of seed- 
corn. Do not plant the ears whose grains fail to sprout 
or that make small, weak sprouts. 
ExeErCIsE. — Every pupil should bring to school at least ene ear of 
corn for use in reciting this lesson. After one ear has been scored 
under the teacher’s direction pupils may by themselves practice scoring 
or comparing other ears. 
Nore TO THE TEACHER.— The first day let every pupil carefully 
score one ear. Repeat this exercise from two to four times, being care- 
ful that each day every pupil scores a different ear or ears. Encourage 
every one to give the reasons why he scored each quality of a certain 
ear high or low, and by consensus of opinion try to decide which are 
really the best ears. 
When the class shows some proficiency in scoring single ears, and 
before interest wanes, endeavor to have every pupil ire from home 
either five, or better ten, selected ears. Let them first place the ears 
quickly from left-to right in supposed order of merit; then score every 
ear, re-arranging the ears according to the scores now given. Two or 
more days may well be spent on each set of ten ears. Then new sets 
may be brought or the different sets may be exchanged. 
It will stimulate interest and proficiency to promise that when the 
class has had five to ten days of practice in corn judging, it may give a 
public exhibition of corn and of corn judging. 
The public exercises should consist of (1) the placing in order of 
merit of five or ten ears, (2) the careful scoring of some of these ears, 
and (3) in answer to the teacher’s questions, a statement of reasons why 
certain ears are scored or arranged low down. 
This may be suppfemented by a display ot sets of ten ears of corn 
brought on invitation by neighbors; by the display of the results of 
a germination test; by the reading of a short composition on some 
phase of corn growing; and by the reading of extracts from bulletins 
on corn published bv some experiment station.

SECTION XXIV. WHEAT, OATS, RYE, AND 
BARLEY 
Turse four crops are called the smal/grains. Each 
one of them is an important human food in some part of 
the world. Oats and barley are largely used as hay or 
; pasturage. Their straw is fed to live-stock or used for 
bedding. Wheat makes better bread than any other grain. 
Resemblances between the small-grains. — Wheat, oats, 
rye, and barley all bear seeds or grains at the top of a 
hollow stem or straw. Although the walls of the straw 
: are thin, the hollow form gives great strength to a small 
amount of stem material. 
These small-grain plants are alike in having no tap- 
: root, but only a great number of fine roots springing 
  from a @ or crown. This crown, or starting-place for 
the permanent roots, is usually about one inch below the 
surface of the ground, whether the seed be planted deep 
or shallow. The seeds are sown one to three inches deep. 
Some differences between the plants of wheat, oats, rye, 
and barley. — The heads of oats are branched and open, 
but those of wheat, rye, and barley have grain clusters or 
spikelets closely joined to the main stem. The heads of 
rye are long, somewhat flattened, and have long beards. 
Common barley and bearded wheat have shorter heads 
with stiff spreading beards. Some of the best varieties of 
wheat, however, do not have beards.

How to recognize the seeds of the small-grains. — The 
threshed grain of wheat, oats, rye, and 
barley may be distinguished as fol- 
lows :— : Re 
Oat kernels are wrapped tightly in 
a long tough hull. Barley grains are 
covered with a hull that has grown 
to the kernel, forming an angular 
grain. Wheat grains have no hull after 
being threshed, and are short and 
usually plump. Rye grains, like wheat 
grains, have no attached hull, but Fis. 85.—Parr or a Younc BARLEY

How to recognize the young 
plants. — It is possible to distin- 
guish between fields of these plants 
when they are small. This can be 
done by the width of nD and 
the erect or spreading growth. It 
is sometimes puzzling to decide 
whether a single young plant is 
= wheat, oats, rye, or barley. On the 
leaves of young barley, wheat, and 
rye plants there are tiny growths: 
like little horns, clasping the stem.

Preparation of land. — Good preparation should be 
given to the land intended for wheat. This grain requires a 
seed-bed that at the time of planting is compact or settled 
in the lower layers but loose and fine in the upper ones. 
This is best secured by plowing land for wheat a number 
of weeks before sowing the seed. Then pulverize the 
clods with a harrow. 
Unfortunately, some farmers seem to think that any kind 
of preparation or none at all is good enough for oats. An 
oat seed is well protected by its hull and can lie for weeks 
uninjured among dry clods. But, nevertheless, oats should 
not be deeply buried under large clods, for this makes 
the plants come up at different dates and ripen unevenly, 
and makes the stand thinner than it would otherwise be. 
Thickness of sowing small-grains.— When planted at the 
usual distance, a wheat or an oat plant generally ripens from 
two to six heads on an equal number of stems or branches. 
But a plant well fertilized, planted early, and given abun- 
dant space, may form more than a score of stems and heads. 
This habit of branching from buds at the crown permits 
the plants of these crops to occupy as much or more than 
the usual space. It explains why sometimes just as large 
a crop comes from sowing two bushels of oats as from sow- 
ing three bushels per acre. About five pecks of wheat 
or rye per acre are generally sown. 
Varieties. — Among the standard varieties of wheat for 
the Southern states are Blue Stem and Fultz, which are 
beardless or smooth, and Fulcaster, which has beards. 
Red oats is the standard Southern kind. It is called rust- 
proof because it is less injured by rust than most other

varieties. The Burt oat is an early Southern variety and 
is sown after Christmas. Souther n rye affords more forage 
than does rye seed brought south from higher latitudes.

Time to sow small-grains.— Rye and wheat are usually 
unhurt by the coldest weather that occurs in the Southern 
states. Hence they are always sown in the fall. Barley 
and winter, or Turf, oats are usually sown in the same 
season. In the southern part of the cotton-belt, Red oats 
can be sown either in the fall or after Christmas. Wher-

larger from sowing the seed in the fall than from sowing 
oats after Christmas (Fig. 89).

oats are much more

larger crops than do light seeds (Figs. 90, 91). Both wheat 
and-oats can be greatly improved by selecting the best 
plants and sowing their seed in a small seed-plot. Any 
improvement once made is apt to be permanent, because 
wheat and oats do not cross with inferior kinds. On any 
farm where oats or wheat mature large, plump grains, it 
is better to use home-grown seeds than those from other

parts of the country. When properly cared for, waeat and 
oats do not “run out” and do not require change of seed. 
Fertilizers for small grains. — These plants make much 
of their growth during the cooler part of the year. Then 
the vegetable matter in the soil is not then rotting very 
rapidly so as to furnish the plant with available nitrogen. 
For this reason the fertilizer for the small grains ought to 
be rich in nitrogen. Nitrate of soda is especially suited to 
the small grains. This can be sown on the growing plants 
in spring and need not be covered. Acid phosphate, ap- 
plied when the seed are sown, is often a profitable fertilizer 
for small grains On very poor soils, it may be necessary 
to add also some form of potash, making a complete fer- 
tilizer. 
EXERCISE. — If this chapter is studied just after rye has formed heads, 
notice the abundance of pollen. What does this suggest? Examine 
a head of oats to learn how many grains in each spikelet or cluster ; 
which one is the larger; and where the beards, if any, start. In the 
same way examine a head of wheat. Resolve to save seeds of the best 
plants of oats or wheat, when ripe, for a seed-row where the seeds can 
be improved by continued selection of the best plants. 
NOTE TO THE TEACHER.—A comparison of heads (or of grains 
of young plants) of the four small-grains will suggest many points of 
similarity and of contrast. Be sure to give practice in identifying the 
plants by means of the clasps. If any of the small-grains are in bloom, 
have each pupil examine a flower and describe the stamens and pistils.

SECTION XXV. COTTON 
Every nation depends largely upon the southern part of 
the United States for cotton. The Chinaman, as well as 
the Englishman, is clothed in American cotton. All 
classes of people, from beggars to princes, make use of it, 
and the world is continually calling for more. Foreign 
countries send more gold into the United States in pay- 
ment for our cotton than for any other American crop.

The cotton crop of the Southern states, which is usually 
between 11,000,000 and 13,000,000 bales per year, gen- 
erally sells for an amount between {600,000,000 and 
$750,000,000, including the seed. 
The next largest producer of cotton is India. Most 
Indian cotton, however, is of poorer quality and lower 
price than the American. Egypt stands third as a cot- 
ton-producing country. Its product has a very long 
staple, and sells for a higher price than American cotton, 
144 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
  COTTON 145 
Some of it is imported into the United States for use in 
making goods where a long staple is required. In length, 
the staple of Egyptian is between that of American long- 
staple and Sea Island cotton. Egyptian ‘and Indian 
cottons are not nearly so productive in America as are 
the varieties generally grown in the Southern states. 
The cotton plant. — Cotton belongs to the Mallow family, 
which includes not only all kinds of cotton, but also okra, 
hollyhocks, and a number of common weeds and flowers. 
The several kinds of cotton differ greatly in their 
stalks, leaves, blooms, and lint. In tropical countries, cotton 
is a tree-like plant, not dying in winter. In the southern 
part of Texas cotton plants springing from 
roots that live over winter are troublesome 
because they give food to the cotton-boll 
weevil early in the spring. 
Why cottcn makes strong thread and 
cloth.— Cotton is popular for making 
thread, cloth, and rope, in spite of the 
fact that a single fiber of the common 
kind is generally not over one inch long. 
This is because a cotton fiber is a twisted, 
hollow tube (Fig. 94). The twist makes \ 
the separate cotton fibers cling tightly to ,,, qaseameatce 
each other, just as two chains would do if _Srranpsor Corron, 
twisted together. The fibers are so small *’“*°*? 
that 1200 to 1500 of them could be laid side by side in the 
space of one inch. 
The kinds of cotton in the United States. — There are 
only three main kinds of cotton grown in the United 
L    
-P-A-G-E-156

States. These are, (1) common or short-staple, (2) long- 
staple upland, and (3) Sea Island cotton. Long-staple 
upland cotton resembles common cotton very much 
in appearance and has the same shape of leaf; but 
its bolls are usually more slender and the lint longer, 
usually being one and one eighth to one and one half inches

long. This extra length makes it worth several cents more 
per pound. However, long-staple cotton is not so produc- 
tive of lint as the best varieties of short-staple and is a little 
later in maturing. It prefers bottom land. Among the 
popular varieties are Allen, Florodora, and Griffin. 
Sea Island cotton is a tall, slender plant with branches, : 
leaves, and blossoms different from those of short-staple
-P-A-G-E-157
  COTTON ms 147 
and long-staple upland cotton. The lint is very long and 
fine, and commands a price more than double that of com- 
mon cotton. There is, however, much less lint per acre. 
Sea Island cotton is largely grown on and near the sea- 
coast in South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, and is not a 
profitable crop very far from the coast (Fig. 95). 
Varieties of short-staple upland cotton.—There are 
several hundred separate names, but many of these are 
merely new names for well-known old varieties. The fol- 
lowing are the main groups of varieties : — 
I. Cluster. 
II. Semi-cluster. 
III. King group. 
IV. Peterkin group. 
V. Big-boll group. 
The cluster varieties bear a part of their bolls in clusters, 
several bolls being near together, and many near the main 
stem. The plantis slender and the upper limbs very short. 
A well-known cluster variety is Jackson. These varieties 
drop many of the squares or blossoms when weather or 
cultivation is unfavorable (Fig. 97). 
Semi-cluster varieties resemble cluster varieties in shape 
of plant, but the bolls are not borne in clusters. The mid- 
dle and upper limbs, though short, are a little longer than 
in the cluster varieties. A popular semi-cluster cotton is 
Hawkins (Fig. 98). 
The zug group consists of low plants with numerous 
crooked limbs of medium length. On many of the blossoms 
there.is a red spot near the base of each petal and inside
-P-A-G-E-158
  148 AGRICULTURE 
the flower. The bolls are small. This is the earliest well- 
known American kind, and hence has been used as a means 
of insuring a crop of open cotton against boll weevils, 
which become numerous late in the season. The lint is 
short and readily falls from the bolls. The early varieties 
of cotton, and indeed of most crops, are not usually so 
productive as those that take a longer time to complete 
their growth (Fig. 99). 
The Peterkin group consists of varieties having small 
seed, some of which are black and nearly free from fuzz. 
A quality much liked about this variety is the fact that 
there is a greater weight of lint in proportion to seed than 
usual. For example, sometimes as much as 37 to 40 per 
cent of the seed-cotton consists of lint, so that a full bale 
(500 pounds) is often made from only 1350 pounds of seed- 
cotton. Among the best-known varieties are Peterkin and 
Layton. Unfortunately, the bolls are small (Fig. 102). 
The dig-doll group takes its name from the large size of 
the bolls. It requires only 45 to 68 of these to yield one 
pound of seed-cotton. Much more can be picked in a day 
than from varieties having smaller bolls. Most of the big- 
boll varieties are late in maturing, but some of them are 
medium in maturity. This group needs to be improved by 
being made earlier, and by an increase in the number of 
bolls per plant. Among the best known and most productive 
varieties of this group are Russell (which has large green 
seed), Truitt, Cleveland, and Cook Improved (Fig. ror). 
Desirable qualities. — The ability to yield the greatest 
number of pounds of lint cotton per acre is the quality 
most desired. A high percentage of lint is often a means
-P-A-G-E-159
  COTTON 149 
of securing this large yield of lint. Large bolls are very 
desirable, since they make picking easier and quicker. 
Earliness is needed in the northern part of the cotton 
belt and is a most important quality wherever the boll 
weevil is present. The “storm-proof” quality, or ability 
of the seed-cotton to cling in the boll rather than to fall 
on the ground, is desirable, if it does not go to the point 
of making picking very difficult: The fiber must not be 
very short. In sandy soils, where cotton-wilt is common, 
ability to live in spite of this disease is an important char- 
acter that has been developed in some varieties, as Dixie, 
some strains of Jackson, and certain Sea Island varieties. 
Examples of very satisfactory varieties. — There is no 
one variety best for all soils and seasons. A productive 
one is Cook Improved. This has rather large bolls, a 
high percentage of lint, and is rather early for a big-boll 
kind. Cleveland is another productive kind, with big 
bolls. Both of these have the disadvantage of easily falling 
out of the boll. Cook Improved is especially liable to rot- 
ting of the bolls. Almost equally productive are Toole and 
Layton. Both have a high percentage of lint, but small 
bolls. For earliness, no well-known variety stands ahead 
of King. 
The varieties most extensively grown at present are 
probably Peterkin, Russell, and Truitt. Triumph is 
adapted to the western region, where the boll weevil is 
present. It has a large boll and a high percentage of lint. 
Generally a storm-proof variety is preferred in Texas. 
Improving or Sreeding cotton. — Even in a pure variety 
there are poor, medium, good, and very good plants, though
-P-A-G-E-160

all may have had an equal chance. Hence, it is very easy 
to improve cotton by selecting seed from the best plants. 
The yield of lint and the percentage of lint in the seed- 
cotton can be increased, the bolls made larger, the lint 
longer, and the plants earlier or shorter-jointed. But all 
of these cannot be attained at the same time. It is best to 
start with a pure variety that is satisfactory in all but one

The fertilizer for cot-

times as much _ phos-

soil, the proportion of nitrogen should be increased. 
EXERCISE. — Write in your notebook the names of the varieties of 
cotton grown in the neighborhood. Which of these have large bulls? 
Small bolls? Long staple? Very green seed? Partly sleek or very 
dark seed? Small seed? Examine ten plants or even ten dead cotton 
stalks and notice how widely they differ. Would there be any advan- 
tage in selecting seed from uriform plants? Decide which kind of plant 
you would select from. Why? When the next cotton crop is mature, be, 
gin to select and improve cotton by the method described in this section. 
NoTE ‘tO THE TEACHER. — If possible, make one or more excursions 
into the cotton fields. Bend every effort to make the pupil see more in 
a cotton plant than ever before; for example, variations in leaves and 
bolls on the same plant, ribs of leaves, the relation between earliness 
and form of plant, etc. If this lesson is studied after the stalks have 
been plowed under, let the practice be largely a study of the seed, — 
sizes, colors, fuzz, shape, hull and kernel, germination, etc. Dampen 
seeds slightly with extremely thin flour paste, stir, then dry. Do the 
seeds stick together? What is the practical advantage of this treat 
ment in planting? Advise pupils to try it at home on a bushel of seed, 
using one cup of flour in two quarts, of water. 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  SECTION XXVI. SWEET POTATOES 
Sweet potatces. — This is another of the crops that grow 
from buds instead of from seeds. These buds can be seen 
after the potato has been kept moist and warm for a num- 
ber of days. Sweet potatoes are placed in a potato bed 
to make the buds grow into shoots, which are called slips. 
The bed is made warm by spreading a layer of manure on 
the ground and covering this with a few inches of soil. 
The potatoes are pressed into the soft earth and covered 
with another layer of soil. As the manure rots or ferments 
it forms heat, which warms the soil above. 
The bed should be made about six or seven weeks before 
the time when the slips are to be placed in the field. 
Setting the slips. — When there is danger of frost,. the 
bed must be covered. After all danger has passed or after 
the time when cotton comes up, the slips are gently pulled 
from the mother potato and transplanted to the field. 
They are usually placed about two feet apart in rows or 
beds three to four feet wide. They must be quickly put 
into the ground so that their roots may not dry. 
If the soil is dry, a little water should be poured around 
each slip, thus settling the earth about its roots. Then be 
sure to cover the wet spot with a layer of dry soil, so that 
the water added may not pass off into the air. After the 
slips have made vines more than two feet long, these may

  SWEET POTATOES 155 
be cut off in sections about eight inches long and planted. 
Press the middle of the cut vine into the soil. 
Varieties. — The flowers of the sweet potato are large and 
pretty, very similar to a morning-glory. They do not of- 
ten form, however. If perfect seeds develop, these, when 
planted, start new varieties, some of which may be better 
than the parent variety.

There are a number of varieties. These differ in flavor, 
earliness, yield, shape of leaf (Figs. 103, 104), and length of 
vines. Southern consumers like those which, when cooked, 
become soft and very sweet. Among such varieties are the 
Sugar Yam and the Dooley. For shipping to Northern 
markets a grower must select varieties having a firm and 
mealy character when cooked. 
Fertilizers for sweet potatoes. — The sweet potato needs 
a complete fertilizer. There is not much danger of having 
the land too rich, provided enough phosphate and potash 
are used to balance the nitrogen that may be in the rich soil. 
Sweet potatoes need to be cultivated often enough to
-P-A-G-E-166
  156 AGRICULTURE 
keep down weeds and to check the evaporation of moisture. 
If the beds are thrown up very high, they dry out rapidly 
and make the crop smaller. Several diseases attack sweet 
potatoes, and the germs that cause them remain in the soil. 
Hence sweet potatoes ought not to be grown on the land 
where a diseased crop grew the year before. 
Storing. —Sweet potatoes must be dug before frost or 
immediately after the first frost. The utmost care should 
be taken in handling them to prevent bruises. Cuts and 
bruises admit germs, which cause rotting. 
Sweet potatoes are generally stored in banks under 
shelter. They are heaped on straw or leaves on a well- 
drained spot. Straw, hay, or corn stalks are placed in a 
thin layer around the heap. A covering of earth nearly 
to the top of the pile is then put on, leaving the extreme 
top of the pile uncovered with earth for better ventilation. 
When freezing weather threatens, the top of the pile 
should be covered more completely. 
A house built for the purpose of storing is more satis- 
factory for large amounts of sweet potatoes. It should 
have double walls, filled in with sawdust. There should be 
slatted bins, open on all sides, ventilators for the house, 
and a stove for heating and drying the air when needed. 
EXERCISE. — Examine an Irish and a sweet potato. Do the roots 
extend through and beyond the sweet potato? Beyond the Irish potato? 
Which of these is a true root? 
NOTE TO THE TEACHER. —If this lesson is studied before frost, 
pupils should bring in sweet potato leaves for comparison and for draw- 
ing. If sweet potatoes are extensively grown in your neighborhood, 
write to Experiment Stations and the Department of Agriculture, 
Washington, D.C., for bulletins on that crop. 7
-P-A-G-E-167
  SECTION XXVII. PEANUTS AND 
WATERMELONS 
Peanuts. — The soil should be loose, sandy, and well 
prepared. It need not be very rich, because the peanut is 
a legume and therefore gets its nitrogen from the air. It 
must, however, get phosphoric acid and potash from the 
soil or from fertilizers. If fertilizers are not obtainable, 
wood ashes may be used. The newly burnt ashes from 
oak and hickory are richer than those from pine wood. 
Lime often increases the yield of peanuts and its use is 
believed to reduce the number of “ pops,” or empty hulls. 
Shell the peanuts without splitting the two halves of the 
kernel and plant after cotton comes up in a place where 
the chickens and pigs cannot get them. The plant forms 
its nuts by sticking its sharp, needle-like pistils into the 
ground. The seeds are borne underground. 
The peanut is an important sale crop in Virginia, North’ 
Carolina, and Tennessee. It is grown for home use and 
for hog food throughout the cotton belt. A good yield 
is 40 to 60 bushels per acre. Peanuts for planting should 
be hand-picked, so that only sound seed may be planted. 
Peanuts should be dug as soon as mature, and cured in 
rather tall slender shocks (Fig. 105). The peanut makes 
the land rich if the vines are allowed to decay in the 
ground,

  158 AGRICULTURE 
There are two principal kinds of peanuts, the Spanish and 
therunning. The Spanish variety has short, upright stems 
and small nuts, which are firmly attached to the plant. 
The running peanuts have larger nuts and require more 
labor in harvesting. 
Watermelons. — Every Southern farm needs its water- 
melon patch for producing melons for home consumption. 
The watermelon is also an important sale crop. From 
some localities thousands of car loads are shipped each 
year. Varieties for shipping should have a firm rind, 
which often accompanies rather inferior quality. For 
home -use there are numbers of good varieties. 
The watermelon likes a warm, sandy, well-drained soil. 
If the soil is poor, manure should be freely used. The 
field should be thoroughly plowed and then marked off into 
checks 10 by 10 or 10 by 8 feet. Where these check fur- 
rows cross, work into the soil one or two shovelfuls of 
well-rotted compost, made of inanure and wood mold 
or of manure and cotton seed. On the manure, sprinkle 
a handful of complete commercial fertilizer or guano. 
With a hoe mark two trenches one inch deep across 
each hill. Plant at least six seeds in one of the trenches. 
A week later plant a like number in the other trench in 
zach hill. Thus if frost kills the earlier plants there 
will be later ones to take their place. 
Thin to two plants in a hill and cultivate shallow, fre- 
quently, and in both directions. Avoid unnecessary mov- 
ing of the vines, or cultivation while the leaves are wet. 
Before cultivation ceases sow a row of cowpeas between 
the rows of watermelon hills.
-P-A-G-E-169
PEANUTS AND WATERMELONS 159 
Do not plant watermelons for more than one year on or 
near the same field. A very fatal disease, watermelon wilt, 
is especially liable to attack watermelons planted on land 
on which the same crop has recently grown. Where this 
disease occurs, it may be necessary to fertilize only with 
wood mold and commercial fertilizers, omitting the manure. 
This is because manure frequently contains and carries 
the germs of the disease. Wilt-resistant varieties of water- 
melons are now being perfected. 
ExeErCIsE. — When peanuts begin next season to form nuts, examine 
them carefully and find the flower, the pistil, and the seed. Notice the 
position of the leaves of peanuts at night. Are there tubercles on the 
roots of peanuts? Are they as large as those’on the roots of cowpeas? 
Is any of the soil from the field where peanuts last grew brought to the 
new peanut field? ¢ 
When watermelons bloom, notice the difference between the pistillate 
and the staminate flowers.

SECTION XXVIII. LEGUMES AND 
INOCULATION 
In former times learned men thought that mankind 
would finally starve to death because there is not enough 
nitrogen in the ground to produce food sufficient to feed 
the growing population of the world. There is no longer 
any fear of this, for it is known that certain plants called 
legumes can make use of the limitless amounts of nitrogen 
in the air. There are about 36,000 tons of this nitrogen 
gas in the air above every acre. Yet cotton, corn, wheat, 
and most plants cannot use a pound of this nitrogen gas 
until legumes have changed it into fertilizer nitrogen. Any 
of the legumes, for example, the cowpea or clover, by the 
aid of the tubercles on its roots (Fig. 108), can grow on 
ground where cotton, corn, or wheat would starve for want 
of nitrogen. Not only do legumes get from the air enough 
nitrogen to enable them to make luxuriant growth on a 
poor field, but they also enrich the soil with a part of this 
nitrogen. When the roots and fallen leaves decay, the 
nitrogen in them is added to the soil. - Still more is added 
if the stems and leaves, as well as the roots, are left on the 
field where the plants grew. That crops often grow much 
larger after a legume is shown in Fig. 106. 
Each germ grows only on the kind of plant to which it 
is accustomed. — Every tubercle on the roots of legumes is

on a soil where there have been no clover tubercies, he 
must place the clover germs there (Fig. 107). He can do 
this by sowing in that place soil from a tieid where clover 
has turned loose its millions of germs. If he wishes to 
grow alfalfa, he must likewise sow on the new field soil 
from an old alfalfa field. 
Inoculation is the name 
given to this placing of 
the proper germs where 
they can form tubercles. 
To inoculate a legume is 
to bring the proper germs 
to its roots (Figs. 108, 109,

How to inoculate leg- 
umes. — Legumes can be in-

    SECTION XXIX. SOME FORAGE PLANTS 
Cowpea. — There are more than a score of varieties of 
cowpeas. Some, like the Speckled, grow almost upright, 
make a good crop of seed, and are easy to mow. Others 
make long runners that sometimes lie almost flat on the 
ground and are hard to mow because they tangle. Still 
others, like the New Era, make ripe pods so quickly that two 
crops of them can be made in the Gulf states in one year, 
by sowing the second crop with seed ripened by the first 
crop in July. This is helpful when seed for planting is 
scarce. Bushy, upright cowpeas form “runners” and 
tangle, if the seed is sown very early. Late sowing, say 
in July, makes the branches, or “runners,” of a running 
variety shorter. 
Cowpeas may be planted at any time in May or June 
and even later. Almost every acre of corn ought to have 
cowpeas sown between the rows, so as to enrich the land. 
After oats and wheat are cut, cowpeas should be sown on 
the stubble land either to be used for hay, for grazing, or 
only for fertilizer. In corn fields and when sown alone, 
cowpeas may be sown either broadcast or in drills. The 
fertilizer most frequently needed is acid phosphate, or on 
some very sandy soils both phosphate and potash. 
Crimson clover. — This plant (Fig. 110) is as useful as 
it is beautiful. It prevents leaching and loss of fertility 
in winter. It adds to the soil about as much nitrogen as 
166
-P-A-G-E-177
  SOME FORAGE PLANTS 167 
does a crop of cowpeas. About the latter part of 
April, the richest kind of hay can be made from it. This 
_ will take the place of part of the corn that so many 
farmers buy for their teams. 
As soon as the hay is cut, 
corn or sorghum or sweet 
potatoes or other late crop 
may be planted to fatten on 
the nitrogen which the clover 
roots and stubble have added 
to the soil. 
Crimson clover is very easy 
to grow. Land that has just 
grown cotton does not even 
have to be plowed. A little 
more than a peck of seed per Brey ata Ss Ham’ Vere 
acre may be sown broadcast in the cotton in September 
and covered by passing a one-horse cultivator between 
each pair of rows. It is easy to fail with crimson clover 
if the land is not:inoculated. To inoculate land for crim- 
son clover, sow with the seed soil from a field where 
crimson clover, red clover, low white clover, or other true 
clover has grown. 
Vetches. — These plants (Figs. 111, 112) have slender 
stems or branches, too weak to stand alone. Hence they 
need to be sown with oats or wheat, so that the weak vines 
may climb up the grain plants and be high enough for 
mowing in May. Vetches are useful for hay, for pasturage, 
and for enriching the soil. Hairy vetch is the most popular 
kind. The seed should be sown broadcast about Septem. 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  168 AGRICULTURE 
ber, 2 to 4 pecks of vetch seed pe ar being mixed with 
the usual amount of seed of wheat or oats. Vetch has an 
advantage over crimson clover, for, unlike clover, it can 
re-seed the land. If the farmer will let vetch plants form 
seed, these seed, dropped in May, will remain sound in the 
ground all summer while a crop of cowpeas or sorghum is 
growing on the field. In the fall they sprout and grow 
without requiring that the land be plowed. To make sure 
that seeds are dropped on the ground, vetch should not be 
closely grazed after the middle of April in the Gulf states. 
If it is mixed with an early variety of beardless wheat, the 
hay may be mown so early that enough second growth of 
vetch will afterwards be made to mature seed. Vetch may 
be inoculated either with soil from a field of any kind of 
vetch or with soil from a spot where garden peas have 
grown. This is because vetch and garden peas are very 
closely related. 
Alfalfa. — This is a clover-like legume, the roots of which 
may live for many years. Alfalfa seed may be sown in 
the cotton belt either early in the fall or early in the 
spring. Three to five cuttings of hay can be made each 
year. It is, therefore, the most valuable of all forage 
plants for soils that suit it. Unfortunately, it does not 
generally do well in most sandy soils in the Southern states. 
Sometimes fertile, sandy land will grow it well if the farmer 
can get rid of the seeds of crab grass and weeds, and if he 
uses much lime, besides manure or fertilizer. Favorite 
soils for alfalfa are the stiff, waxy lime lands of Alabama, 
Mississippi, and Texas, and stiff, rich, but well-drained 
river bottom lands.
-P-A-G-E-179
  SOME FORAGE PLANTS 169 
One of the worst enemies of alfalfa is love vine or dodder. 
This is a vine like the one that twines around blackberries

and sucking its sap. The spots where it appears should

Red clover (Fig. 113). — Except in the extreme Southern 
and Western states this is the most widely grown legume. 
It lives for two years, the seed usually being sown in the 
spring, on growing wheat or grass, or alone. The seed 
may be sown in the fall. Red clover affords two or more 
cuttings the second year, sometimes even the first year on

suitable soil in the extreme Southern states. It requires a 
lime soil and is unsuited to most of the sandy lands from 
the Carolinas to Louisiana. 
Japan clover. — This is a soil-improving plant, but not a 
true clover; hence soil from near its roots will not inocu- 
late crimson or red clover. Its true name is Lespedeza. 
It is the best pasture plant among the legumes for the 
poorest Southern soils. It grows wild over the greater part 
of the Southern states. Although an annual, it comes up 
every spring from seed shed the preceding fall. The seed 
may be sown in early spring alone or on a field of oats or 
wheat. On rich, moist land it sometimes grows tall enough 
to be used for hay. The pasturage and the hay are very 
nutritious. 
Soy bean. — This annual legume (Figs. 114, 115, 116) is 
used like the cowpea for hay, seed, and soil improvement. 
It has the advantage over cowpeas that the hay does not 
tangle and that the seed are threshed out instead of being 
picked. It is sown in May or early in June in rows 
about three feet apart. 
Grass plants used as food for live-stock.— Common 
grasses all have slender, pointed leaves, which wrap partly 
around the stem. Those that creep along the ground and 
form roots from the joints, like Bermuda grass and carpet 
grass, are generally good for pasturage. North of the 
Gulf states favorite pasture grasses are blue grass, orchard 
grass, and red-top. Those that stand erect, like Johnson 
grass, sorghum, and millet, are chiefly useful for hay. 
Many pastures are more profitable than any cultivated 
land on the farm. Any land that has become too poor to

other suitable forage plants. Land improves while being 
used for pasture chiefly because much vegetable matter is 
formed near the surface and because some of the wild 
clovers creep in and start 
the fertilizer factories on 
their roots. 
In the Southern states 
much more land should 
be used for pasturing live- 
stock. This becomes 
doubly necessary where 
the boll-weevil is, because 
cotton cannot there be 
profitably grown on the 
poorest land. This, how- 
ever, would yield a fair 
profit if used for pasture. 
Bermuda grass.— Some 
farmers fear to introduce 
this grass because it is difficult to destroy. There will seldom 
be any desire to destroy it if pastures of it are started 
in the right location. With Bermuda grass may be mixed 
Japan clover for summer grazing and either bur clover or 
vetch for winter grazing. Another excellent grass for 
pasture is carpet grass, which is not difficult to destroy. 
Portions of the plants or roots must be set, or the seed 
of carpet grass must be saved from the low spots. 
Sorghum. — This annual plant will grow on almost any 
soil. It is useful for green forage or for hay, and for mak- 
ing syrup. The seed must be sown thick to make good     Fic. 116.— Pops or Soy BEANns

  SECTION XXX. WEEDS 
A WEED is simply a plant growing where it is not wanted. 
Hence a kind of plant that is useful in some fields may be 
a weed in other fields because it interferes with the growth 
of some crop. Among the plants that are sometimes 
weeds and at other times useful are Johnson grass, crab 
grass, and beggarweed. 
How weeds injure the farmer.— Weeds are injurious 
because (1) they use plant-food and fertilizer needed by 
the more valuable crop plants; (2) they rob the culti- 
vated plants of water by taking up the moisture of the 
soil for their own use; (3) they greatly increase the ex- 
pense of cultivating the crops. Weeds are robber plants 
and must not be allowed to become large and strong, for 
then the crop will be ruined. Poor farmers cultivate their 
crops only as much as weeds compel them to, but good 
farmers cultivate the ground when there are no weeds, so 
as to keep the lower layers of the soil moist. 
Study the habits of weeds. — To get rid of weeds in the 
easiest and cheapest way, study their habits. First make 
sure whether they are annuals. If they are annuals, such 
as crab grass, foxtail, ragweeds, and bitterweed, all that 
has to be done is to keep them from maturing seed. If 
they are biennials, like sweet clover, no seeds should be 
allowed to form for two years. If they are perennials, 
like Johnson grass, nut grass, thistles, and dock, the forma- 
174
-P-A-G-E-185
WEEDS 175 
tion of seeds should be prevented by cutting the tops 
down for a number of years. Even if the growth of seed 
is prevented, there is still more work to be done to rid the 
land of the roots of these long-lived robbers. 
The vigorous growth and abundant formation of seed 
by some weeds are shown in Figs. 117 and 118. 
Killing perennial weeds. — Weeds that come up year 
after year from the roots are usually not easy to kill 
  
  Plowing them with a sharp plow sometimes destroys them 
if the roots are all brought to the surface and thus dried. 
This is one of the easiest ways to kill Bermuda grass. Shal- 
low plowing is best for killing this grass because the shal- 
low furrow-slice ai out more completely than a thicker 
layer of upturned soil. Any plant is more easily killed 
late in its eave season, for then it cannot so easily 
| be  
-P-A-G-E-186
  176 AGRICULTURE 
mend an injury. Johnson grass is more easily killed in 
August or September than earlier. In killing biennial or 
perennial weeds, they must be cut off below the crown, 
Smothering weeds. — Sometimes the farmer can hire 
other plants to kill weeds. A crop of cowpeas or of 
velvet beans will sometimes smother Bermuda grass so 
that very little of it is left at the end of the season. The 
cowpeas or velvet beans kill the grass by shading it and 
by taking up the soil water which the grass needs. 
Keeping weeds off the farm. — Good plowing and care- 
ful preparation may greatly reduce the number of weeds 
on the farm. But their seed or those of worse weeds may 
be brought back mixed with purchased seed of grain, 
clover, or grass. Weed seeds are sure to be present in the 
cheaper grades of grass and clover seeds. It pays to buy 
the best of these in spite of their extra cost. 
EXERCISE. — Learn to recognize the seeds of some of the worst 
weeds. A collection that is interesting and useful consists of small 
bottles of weed seeds, properly labeled. 
Note TO THE TEACHER.— Let pupils make a list of weeds of 
which they can find the seeds and ask them to observe whether these 
are spread by (1) wind, (2) adhering to men or animals, (3) by the 
popping of the pods or seed cases, or (4) otherwise. If Bailey's 
«Lessons with Plants” (Macmillan) is at nand, read pp. 336-341.

-P-A-G-E-187
SECTION XXXI. THE VEGETABLE GARDEN 
Tue products that a half-acre garden affords are gener- 
ally worth more than those produced on several acres of 
common field. From a half acre of land a man whose 
business is gardening sometimes sells enough vegetables 
to bring him $100 to $200 or more. To make a garden 
productive, treat it as follows: — 
(1) Manure it heavily, using 20 to 40 wagon loads of 
compost or manure per acre each year. (2) Keep every 
part of it busy, growing two or three crops a year on 
the same rows. (3) Plant such vegetables as will furnish 
something for the table every week in the year. (4) Plow 
the garden deep in the late fall or winter and keep it 
always so clean that a crop of rank weeds and weed seeds 
will not need to be plowed under. The garden will pay 
well for all the manure put on it. Vegetables are more 
tender and better, as well as: earlier and more abundant, 
when grown on rich land. : 
Planting seed.—In planting garden seed, cover the 
large seeds, like beans and peas, with several inches of 
earth. The small seeds must be covered very lightly. 
Seeds will not readily germinate in rather dry, loose soil 
unless it be pressed closely against them, so that it may 
bring up moisture, just as a wick brings oil to the lamp 
flame. Many gardeners tread on nearly every seed they 
plant, walking on the open drill on top of the seeds. The 
77 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  178 er 
same packing of the seeds against the soil in the bottom 
of the furrow can be secured by rolling an empty wheel- 
barrow over them before they are covered. The ground 
must not be wet when packed. Loose soil should cover 
the footprints or the track of the wheelbarrow. This 
loose layer of soil keeps the moisture from rising above 
the seeds and evaporating. | 
How to set a young plant. — Many kinds of vegetable 
seeds, such as those of cabbage and tomatoes, are sown 
in boxes or hotbeds before they are safely planted out 
of doors. In these boxes or hotbeds the seeds should be 
planted thickly in tiny trenches several inches apart. If 
possible, the plants should be thinned as soon as they show 
the first well-developed true leaf. The surplus plants should 
be transplanted to other boxes or to other parts of the cold- 
frame. Plants that have been moved once while still in boxes 
or coldframes are stronger, better shaped, have a better 
root system, and grow better when placed in the garden. 
Let the plant grow several inches high in the seed-box if it 
must be transplanted directly from the box to the garden. 
In transplanting, avoid doubling the roots. If the 
ground is so dry that the young plants must be watered 
when transplanted, first punch the hole; next insert the 
plant; then pour in a cupful of water, which will settle 
the soil snugly around the roots. Last and most impor- 
tant of all, draw up loose, drier soil around the plant and 
over the wet spot. Every time a young plant is watered, 
the wet spot should afterwards be covered with loose, dry 
soil to hold the moisture and to keep a crust from forming. 
When rather large plants are transplanted, it is best to
-P-A-G-E-189
  THE VEGETABLE GARDEN 179 
pinch off some of the leaves so that they may not evaporate 
water faster than the broken roots can supply it. 
A succession of vegetables. — A little work ard a little 
planning every week are worth more to a garden than 
twice as much work every two weeks. By thus planning, 
it is possible to have vegetables every week in the year. 
Most well-cultivated gardens in the Southern states afford 
an abundance of vegetables during May, June, and July. 
To be sure of a continuous supply through August, Sep- 
tember, and October, make late plantings of tomatoes, 
butter beans, okra, corn, eggplants, and other vegetables 
that thrive in hot weather. 
The period when fresh vegetables are scarce is from 
November to March. During this time, there should be 
a stored-up supply of sweet potatoes, fall-grown Irish 
potatoes, cushaws, pumpkins, dried beans, dried sliced 
okra, and ruta-baga turnips. Fresh vegetables can also 
be had during most of this time by planting in July, 
August, or September seeds of collards, cabbage, ruta- 
baga turnips, beets, beans, and turnips. The planting of 
onion sets in the fall and the sowing of seed of kale and 
spinach for winter “greens” should not be forgotten. 
Salsify is a delicious vegetable available for fall use. 
Hotbed or coldframe.— To obtain early vegetables a 
hotbed or coldframe will be helpful, because under this 
the young plants can be started during the winter. The 
frame is made as shown in Figure 121. It has no bottom, 
but rests over a shallow pit into which a layer of damp 
manure has been placed, and covered with several inches 
of soil, The purpose of this manure is to afford, by
-P-A-G-E-190
  180 AGRICULTURE 
fermentation, heat to warm the soil in which the seeds are 
to be planted. Place the seeds in oe a few inches apart. 
When the frame is placed over such a layer of heating 
manure, the whole is called a hotbed. A similar frame 
is called a coldframe if no manure is used under it. The 
cover usually consists of several glass sashes. On a 
coldframe the cover may be of white cloth. 
To make a small hotbed or coldframe to be covered by 
a single sash construct a wooden frame six feet long and 
at least three feet wide. The back should be twelve 
inches high and the front eight inches. It is better to 
make it at least six feet wide, thus requiring two sashes. 
The glass sashes slide on strips nailed to the sides or on 
crosspieces, as shown in Fig.121. The earth should be 
banked around the outside of the frame. 
The slope of the glass sash should be towards the 
south. The sun’s rays strike through the glass, which 
serves as a trap for the heat. In this heated air and soil 
young cabbage, tomatoes, and other plants grow rapidly. 
On mild days, the glass must be lifted so as to prevent 
disease and to accustom the plants to cool weather. A 
box kept near a window indoors, or covered with a few 
panes of glass, may take the place of a hotbed. 
Vegetables that may be planted in cool weather. — 
Among the plants of the garden that can endure rather 
cold weather are peas, kale, mustard, radish, spinach, and 
lettuce. The seeds of these plants are therefore usually 
the first to be planted, in February or earlier. Young 
cabbage plants endure much cold. In the central part 
of the Gulf states they often live through the winter

deep and made very rich with neni manure. A 
quicker crop is secured by buying 
growing them. Onions are among the hardiest of vegeta- 
bles. Onion sets are placed in the ground ‘in the fall, or 
in January or February. Some varieties of onions grow 
well from seeds planted in the fall or late winter, the 
young plants being afterwards transplanted. Garden peas 
are planted three or four inches deep, usually in January, 
February, and March. ; 
Tender vegetables. — Among the plants easily killed by 
frost are beans, tomatoes, eggplants, squash, and all the 
other members of the gourd or melon family. These 
cannot safely show above ground until danger of frost is 
past ; so they are usually planted about the same time as 
the earliest cotton. Tomatoes are generally started under 
glass and transplanted as soon as the danger of frost is past. 
Vegetables that suffer from hot weather. — Peas and 
lettuce do not thrive during hot weather. Cabbages and 
turnips are usually ruined by the harlequin cabbage-bug 
and by other insects after midsummer; they should, there- 
fore, be grown either as very early crops or in the fall. the roots instead of 
EXERCISE. — Write the names of all plants the leaves of which you 
know to be cooked for “greens.” During what months can each one 
be used? Make a list of all the vegetables you have ever seen growing 
in your home garden. What vegetables besides these have you seen 
growing elsewhere? If you have never grown any plants that were 
really your own, ask at home if you may not have one row in the garden 
for yourself. Among the plants that can be most quickly grown in it 
re radishes, turnips, lettuce, and in warm weather, bunch snap beans.

obtainable garden seeds, as to size, color, germination, etc. Write to

flower garden, all one’s own, is a perpetual delight, espe- 
cially to a young person. 
In general, the best way to lay off a flower garden is not 
to lay it off at all. It should not be cut up into stiff beds. 
The space directly in front of the house should be left 
open (Fig. 122). Bermuda grass makes the best sum- 
mer covering for Southern lawns. By sowing white clover

with its carpet of green before winter has wholly passed. 
There may be a border of low flowering plants on each 
side of the walk, while against the walls of the house may be 
grouped taller plants and shrubs as a background for beds 
of smaller, bright-blooming flowers. The colors of flowers

show better if many of the same kind are massed together. 
The place for shrubs. — Against the fence on either side, 
and in the corners by the steps, may be planted shrubs, 
while between the front and back yards, and wherever there 
is any unsightly object in view, there should be a screen of 
tall shrubs or vines. The Japan honeysuckle and the 
Cherokee rose are good evergreen vines for this purpose. 
The purple wistaria is a hardy climbing shrub that quickly 
covers unsightly objects or shades sunny porches. For 
ornamental hedges, privet and pomegranate are good

do not surrender to heat or drought, and smiling beds of 
pinks and verbenas. 
In the next place, select plants so as to have a constant 
succession of flowers all the year round. 
Winter and early spring flowers.— White hyacinths, 
jonquils, sweet violets, and Japan quince bloom early in 
the year. Then, when the red maple begins to glow in 
the woods, come the periwinkles, the early narcissus, 
daffodils, spireas (bridal wreaths), and the blue hyacinths. 
With March, the early lilacs and the late spireas begin to 
open their eyes. April brings, along with dogwood, red- 
bud, and haw blossoms and wild azaleas in the woods, a 
troop of early roses, the wistaria, snowball (Fig. 124), 
white iris or flag, and some of the lilies. On through May 
and June the bright throng comes trooping by. 
Flowers for the hot dry season. — During the hot months 
of midsummer and early autum, nature generally calls a 
halt to this gay procession, and so the gardens must be pro- 
vided with plants that are hardy to sun and drought. For 
this purpose choice lies between ever blooming roses, holly- 
hocks, larkspurs and mallows, four-o’clocks, phlox, “ snow- 
on-the-mountain,” bear’s grass, Spanish bayonet, “old 
maids” and “bachelor’s buttons,” ‘“ black-eyed Susans,” 
and the whole great sunflower family. 
Fall and winter bloomers. —In our climate, many of 
the summer flowers linger into late fall and early winter. 
This is especially true of the roses. The chrys 4n’thé miims, 
too, linger till long after frost; the verbenas and scarlet 
sage and the canna last late into the year. The fall 
months are brightened by the yellow and brown of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-198

marigolds and by the varied colors of cosmos, conspicuous 
above its fringe-like foliage. 
Beautifying the school grounds. — The same principles, 
in the main, will apply to the school as to the home 
garden. As a general thing, more hardy plants should 
be chosen for the school grounds for the reason that dur- 
ing the part of the year when the school is not in session 
they will probably receive no attention whatever. Hence 
it is well to choose native shrubs and flowers for planting 
around the schoolhouse. Many wild plants grown in the 
woods are quite as beautiful as the most expensive pro- 
ductions of the florist. An ideal location for a schoolhouse 
is in a grove, for then there is no need for flowers, except, 
perhaps, in a special school garden beyond the shade of the 
trees. The school garden should be a plot of ground near 
the school, in which each pupil has his own Ltile collection 
of flowers, vegetables, and crop plants. 
EXERCISE. — Write in your notebook the common names of all the 
wild or cultivated shrubs that you think would make the school grounds 
look better. Think about the best place to plant them. Do you know 
where they could be obtained without cost? 
NOTE TO THE TEACHER. — This section affords an opportunity to 
imeress the advantages of improving the school grounds, as does also 
the section on trees. Could not some of the pupils, working together, 
make a map of the school grounds, showing location of buildings, 
fences, trees, shrubs, etc.? Let other pupils copy this. Then let each, 
after a few days, hand in his or her map, indicating on it where a hédge 
vr screen of vines should be located and where trees and shrubs ought 
to be planted. Tell them to keep these maps. After they have studied 
the sections on trees let them write on the maps the kinds of trees that 
they would choose for any spot needing trees.
-P-A-G-E-199
SECTION XXXIII. GROWING FLOWERS 
Most of the plants found in the flower garden may be 
classed either as (1) shrubs,(2)bulbs and tubers, or (3) herbs. 
The shrubs are all per- 
ennial and so are most 
of the plants growing 
from bulbs and tubers. 
Flowering herbs may be 
cither annual, biennial, 
or perennial. Asa rule 
perennial plants furnish 
the earliest flowers, for 
they have laid up in their 
roots, stems, or bulbs a 
supply of food intended 
to hasten the growth of 
the new flowers. 
‘ Shrubs. — Most culti- 
vated shrubs can be in- 
creased by means of 
cuttings or by suckers 
from the old roots.        Fic.    
125 — WASHINGTON’S FLOWER 
GarDEN at Mr. VERNON 
Shrubs require less care than smaller 
plants and endure for many years. 
There are roses of very many colors, and they are 
among the most beautiful of cultivated flowers. Roses 
are grown from cuttings, which are started either out of 
189
-P-A-G-E-200
190 AGRICULTURE 
doors or under glass, depending on the kind of rose, the 
climate, and the soil. On these points you will need the 
advice of those neighbors who grow roses. Where practi- 
cable to start your rose out of doors proceed as follows: 
during the winter take a portion of a slender rose branch 
less than one year old on which the wood has recently 
become firm. Cut this six to eight inches long and remove 
the leaves. Be sure that a smooth cut is made. If the 
cuttings are to be started in moist sand under glass, 
they may be much shorter and of younger wood. Part 
of the upper leaf may be left. Place the longer cuttings 
in a sloping position in a trench in the flower garden 
and cover them up to the top bud with earth. Where the 
winters are cold a thin layer of leaves may be added. 
Roots may form in four to six weeks. When one year 
old or less, the plants may be transplanted to the place 
where they are to remain. Roses like good soil, and the 
ground around them ought each year to receive a coating 
of manure, which serves as fertilizer and a mulch. On 
sour soils a little lime is helpful. 
There are a number of classes of roses, some blooming 
almost continuously and others only once or twice during 
the year. 
Bulbs, tubers, etc.— The onion and the lily are ex- 
amples of bulbs. A bulb consists of a number of thick- 
ened, tightly wrapped leaves. Bulbs that grow form 
new bulbs, and by planting these the plant is multiplied. 
Plants grown from bulbs need rich soil. Most of them 
afford very early flowers. In cold climates bulbs are dug, 
dried, and stored indoors during the winter.
-P-A-G-E-201
GROWING FLOWERS ~— IQI 
The canna affords a wealth of blooms —red, pink, 
yellow, and other gay colors —during the heat of sum- 
mer. It is increased by planting portions of the roots. 
In the Gulf states no winter protection is needed except 
to cut off the tops as soon as frost occurs and to place 
these over the roots, covering all with a light coat of earth. 
Violets for winter and early spring, and hardy chrysan- 
themums for late fall flowering, are increased by dividing 
the roots of old clusters of plants. 
Flowers easily grown from seed.— Most of these are 
annual plants, living less than one year. Some are Icager- 
lived, for example, the foxglove, the hollyhock, and the 
larkspur. 
The California poppy is a fine-leaved plant, with large, 
brilliant flowers. The seeds of this plant, and also of the 
common fopfies, are sown as soon as danger of severe 
freezes is past. At the same time the seeds of pizks or 
carnations are sown. 
The sweet william is closely related to the pink. The 
flowers are showy and beautiful. The plant is rather 
hardy towards heat. 
The annual ph/oxes are among the best flowers for chil- 
dren to grow, because they afford such a mass of varied 
and bright colors so soon after the seeds are sown in early 
spring. They need good soil and abundance of water. 
Pansies are general favorites for early flowers. They 
combine two or more rich colors in the same flower. 
Among the most beautiful of all are the shades of purple. 
The pansy, and, indeed, most of these very early annuals, 
can be sown in boxes indoors (Fig. 126), arid transplanted to 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
  192 AGRICULTURE 
the flower garden as soon as freezing has ceased. Pansies, 
like sweet peas, are cool-weather bloomers; both require 
moist soil and are unable to withstand much heat. 
Verbenas are the favorite flowers of many children and 
of many grown people as well. They grow either from 
seed or cuttings. There are few more beautiful sights in 
Courtesy

  the flower garden than a border thickly bedecked with the 
purple and crimson or other various colors of the verbena. 
Among the annuals most able to continue blooming dur- 
ing the heat of summer are the fetunia and the nasturtium. 
There are both dwarf and climbing nasturtiums, all having 
large, bright flowers. The seeds of petunias are so small 
that, like many other flower seeds, they need either the 
shallowest possible covering, or none. A good way to 
plant such seeds is to sow them, and then with a board 
press them against the surface; sprinkle over them the 
thinnest possible layer of very fine sifted forest soil. This 
holds moisture and does not easily form a crust.
-P-A-G-E-203
  GROWING FLOWERS 193 
Among the plants that do not need to be sown until the 
weather becomes warm are the marigolds and cosmos. 
Their blooms are wanted in late summer and fall, after 
most flowers have ceased blooming. Scarlet sage is also 
one of the most brilliant of the autumn flowering plants, 
its tall stems being crowded with bright red flowers. Ho/- 
lyhocks are tall plants grown from seed, but not showing 
their large, gaudy flowers until the second year. 
Window gardens. Many persons who have not room 
for an outdoor flower garden find pleasure in a little window 
garden. The flowers may be grown in pots or boxes, 
inside a sunny window or on a shelf outside (Fig. 127). 
Most of the smaller outdoor flowering plants may be thus 
grown from seeds, bulbs, roots, and cuttings, and in ad- 
dition, many less hardy plants, such as begonias, crab 
cactus, and geraniums. To start geraniums or other soft- 
wood cuttings, place the lower portions of the cuttings in 
clean sand kept constantly wet, and in a sunny window. 
If necessary, a pane of glass can be placed over them to 
retain the heat, and thus make a tiny greenhouse. 
ExeErcISE. — Ask some grower of flowers whether the present is a 
suitable time to start cuttings of roses and other flowers. If so, make 
some cuttings andset them. Ask at home or at some neighbor's if there 
is any flower from which you can get a start of bulbs, roots, or cuttings. 
Before using them make sure they are free from disease or insect injury. 
Write in your notebook a list of five of your favorite flowers. 
NoTE TO THE TEACHER. — Catalogues are sent free by most seedsmen. 
The illustrations in them and their descriptions of varieties will be of 
greatest service to you in enlisting the pupil’s interest in flowers. An 
especially helpful publication is Farmers’ Bulletin No. 195, United States 
Department of Agriculture on Annual Flowering Plants. If not already 
obtained, write to the United States Department of Agriculture for bul-

letins on school gardens, and consider whether your school can longer 
afford to dp without one. See also note to Section XXXII and Appen- 
dix. In city schools or elsewhere, boxes of flowers in the windows 
serve a useful purpose. Let the main aim be to make the pupils closer 
observers and more appreciative of flowers. Urge them to bring flowers 
to the class now and later to be used as object lessons. Familiarize the 
pupils with the foliage as well as with the blooms of the flowers that can 
be inspected. Is an excursion to some greenhouse or flower pit prac- 
ticable?

SECTION XXXIV. FOREST TREES 
Tue true value of trees is scarcely realized until we con- 
sider the sufferings of people who live in countries that 
are almost without trees. Parts of India, Egypt, China, 
and Korea are in this treeless condition. In winter the 
people suffer intensely from cold and have to work very 
hard to supply themselves with even a little fuel. A day’s 
hard work may be rewarded with only a basket of the 
roots of shrubs. Every bit of refuse in the streets and 
stables is collected and dried for fuel. 
Rapid destruction of the forest.— Our own country is in 
danger of becoming a country that will lack trees enough 
to furnish lumber for our homes and to supply our fac- 
tories. Those who have studied the matter state that in 
the United States each year three times as much wood 
is consumed as is supplied by one year’s growth of all 
the trees in the country. Some even declare that unless 
this waste is promptly stopped, in twenty-five years there 
will be practically no forests east of the Mississippi 
River. This misfortune can be prevented by every one’s 
quickly realizing the true value of a tree. There is no 
time to be lost, for it takes most kinds of trees 50 to 100 
years to grow large enough to make the best lumber. 
The tree lives longer than any other form of vegetable

life. It is the patriarch among plants. The life of a 
young tree ought not to be taken except for good cause. 
The farmer who makes firewood out of saplings is de- 
stroying the property of his children. When trees mature 
or reach the point where their growth is very slow, they 
should be cut and used, so that they may yield a profit 
and make room for younger and more rapid-growing trees. 
Saplings or young trees should be removed only where 
the growth is too thick. 
Forest fires. — The long-leaf or yellow pine tree may be 
six years old before it becomes one foot high. A single fire,

started by some careless hunter or other thoughtless per- 
son “to burn off the grass,” may kill a thousand of these 
and other valuable kinds of trees on every acre that it 
invades (Fig. 128). Besides this, fires make the soil of
-P-A-G-E-207
  FOREST TREES 197 
the forest poorer by destroying the vegetable matter and 
thus retard the growth of the surviving trees. The old 
method of boxing young pine trees in order to make 
turpentine (as in Fig. 129) causes them to catch fire more 
easily than they otherwise 
would. The new method 
of collecting sap for tur- 
pentine, using cups and 
metal gutters, is much 
better for the tree (Fig. 
130). 
Uses of forests. — For- 
ests not only furnish lum- 
ber, material for paper, 
and scores of useful arti- 
cles, but they decrease 
floods. When rain falls 
on the soil of a forest 
that has never been burnt 
over, it sinks into the 
mellow soil and slowly 
drains away to the creeks, 
which carry off the water ff ; 
without overflowing. & ——————— 
Fic. 129.—THE OLD METHOD OF BOXING 
PINE TREES FOR TURPENTINE    When the trees are cut, 
the surface loses its layer 
of leaves and becomes hard, so that when heavy rains 
occur, the water rushes rapidly down the slope, washes

lands.

-P-A-G-E-209
  FOREST TREES 199 
Telling the age of a tree. — The age of a tree may be 
discovered by examining the log or the stump left after 
it has been felled. On the smoothly cut end of the log 
there are a number of light-colored rings with layers of 
darker color between (Fig. 131). Generally one light- 
colored ring and one dark-colored layer were formed each 
year. The number of light rings tells in years the age of 
that part of the body of the tree. The age of each limb 
is told in the same way. 
There is another way to tell how long it has been since the 
pine and some other trees were only as high as their 
lowest limbs now are. This is done by counting the 
number of sets of limbs or sets of knots where limbs 
once grew. Every set of limbs, growing out of the trunk 
at about the same place, means one year; for each set 
represents the buds or young branches which form on 
tue twig near the place where the new and the old: growth 
join (Fig. 132). 
EXERCISE. — Report to the teacher the age of the following by 
counting the annual rings: (1) a log, or stump, or piece of firewood, 
all from an old-field pine, (2) a similar piece from a long-leaf pine. 
(3) a branch of either old-field or long-leaf pine. Which has the 
thicker annual rings? Judging by this, which tree grows more rapidly? 
Select a pine tree ro to 20 feet high and, without cutting it, count the 
sets of limbs and tell how long it has been since that tree was only as 
high as its lowest limb now is. Think about this subject for your next 
composition, ‘“ How Much Harm One Forest Fire Did.” Is the heart- 
wood or the sapwood the best for lumber? 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
  »SECTION XXXV. FOREST TREES (Continued) 
Ir a wire is stapled to a tree, it will not be pushed 
outwards as the tree grows larger, but will be buried under 
the new layer of wood (Fig. 133). It thus cuts into and 
injures the lumber. Fig. 134 shows a better way to attach 
a fence wire to a tree. 
Planting trees on the school grounds.— When the 
school ground needs shade and beauty, plant trees and 
pretty shrubs taken from the woods. Set aside one day as 
“Arbor Day” for the planting of these trees. In the 
Southern states a good time for this is in December, 
January, and February. Plan what kinds of trees and 
shrubs to plant and where to put every one in order to 
make the school grounds as beautiful as possible. They 
will live better if not planted on the playground, where the 
shaking will dry the roots. If planted there, they should 
be protected by strong stakes until the trees are several 
years old. The directions given in Section XXXVI for 
setting fruit trees will help in setting shade trees. 
Choose some of the following for planting on the school 
grounds: the water or willow-leaved oak as a round-topped 
shade tree, suited even to poor, dry soils; the sweet 
gum, for its rapid growth, graceful shape, its willingness 
to grow on almost any soil, and for its red and purple 
leaves in autumn; the mulberry for its rapid growth, good

The different trees may be recognized in the distance 
by the differences in their habits of branching. For ex- 
ample, notice the continuous central stem in the pine and 
hickory (Figs. 136 and 137), and observe that in the walnut 
(Fig. 139) and elm this is usually lost. 
EXERCISE. — Compare the leaves in Fig. 135 with the leaves found in 
the woods, and write in your notebook the name that corresponds to 
each letter. You will find it interesting and instructive to make a map 
of the trees growing on a small area of woodland, representing the 
position of each tree by a figure on the map; then on the next page of 
your notebook write the name of the tree corresponding to each 
number. You may be surprised to find which pupil knows the greatest 
number of trees in such a contest. 
NOTE TO THE TEACHER. — Strive to inculcate in the pupils the habit 
of carefully observing trees. Among the means to this end are the col- 
lecting and identifying of the leaves of trees, excursions to the woods, and 
recognition of trees by their bark. The mode of branching of different 
kinds and with different surroundings may be taught by requiring pupils 
to draw outlines of trees. A drawing exercise may take the place of a 
recitation. Let the pupils complete the maps of the school grounds 
begun as an exercise in Section XXXII and write on it, on each spot 
where a tree is needed, the kind of tree that each pupil prefers.

and (5) spraying to destroy injurious insects and plant

a number of varieties, so that there may be early, medium, 
and late fruit. 
Cultivation and fertilization. — Before planting fruit 
trees the land must be deeply plowed and well harrowed. 
Peach trees are generally set about 16 feet apart each

way and apple trees 25 to 40 feet. On rather poor 
land fruit trees ought to be fertilized when set and each 
year afterwards. For young trees a complete fertilizer 
is best. In later years a mixture of phosphate and some 
form of potash may be sufficient. Nitrogen should then 
be supplied by cow- 
peas or some other 
“catch crop” grown 
as a fertilizer be- 
tween the trees. 
Scatter the fertili- 
zer as far out as the 
limbs extend and 
work it in with a 
cultivator or harrow.

first year. Those set in the fall bear a few more berries, 
but there is only a fraction of a crop the first spring. 
The main crop is borne the second year. 
Some varieties of strawberries produce flowers contaim- 
ing pistils, but no perfect stamens. Among these imperfect 
or pistillate varieties, every third or fourth row should be 
planted with perfect kinds to furnish pollen. Perfect 
varieties are marked in most catalogues with the letter “s,” 
meaning that the variety bears stamens as well as pistils, 
or by the letter “4,” meaning bi-sexual, or having two 
sexes. The names of the imperfect varieties are followed 
by the letter “7,” which here stands for the word “ pis- 
tillate.” For home use there should be both early and 
late varieties. The following are all among the staminate 
or perfect varieties: Excelsior (early), Lady Thompson 
and Klondike (rather early and hardy), Gandy (large and 
late). 
Strawberry plants need to be well fertilized with a com- 
plete fertilizer. The bed should be renewed every few 
years because young plants bear more fruit than old ones. 
To start a new bed set the young plants that form 
where the runners take rdot. 
When a fruit tree is old enough to transplant.— A 
nurseryman does not count the age of a tree from the 
time the seed is planted, but from the time of budding or 
grafting it. Peach trees are ready to transplant one year 
after the budding has been done. The apple tree is trans- 
planted when either one, two, or three years old. 
Setting a fruit tree.—The time to set a fruit tree 
is after the leaves fall and before the buds swell in the
-P-A-G-E-222
212 AGRICULTURE 
spring to form new leaves. The period from November 
. to February is the usual time for setting fruit trees in the 
Southern states. The holes should be so dug that the

roots will not need to be bent. All bruised or broken 
roots should be cut off with a smooth cut, which heals 
more quickly than a ragged break.
-P-A-G-E-223
  FRUITS 213 
The very long roots may also be cut back. In setting 
trees keep all roots straight. The earth taken from near 
the top of the hole is generally the richest, so this soil 
should be placed near the roots. The earth must be firmly 
packed around the roots so as to keep them thoroughly 
moist. If the soil were put in without packing, air-spaces 
would be left and the roots would become dry. The upper 
layer of soil, however, must be left loose as a mulch to re- 
tain the water in the lower layers. If a tree is loosened 
before it has formed a full set of roots, it is apt to die 
because the shaking causes air-spaces to be left around 
the roots instead of moist soil. The tree ought to be set 
in the ground at least as deep as it grew in the nursery row. 
Pruning at the time of transplanting. — When a young 
tree is dug up, a large proportion of its fine roots and 
root-hairs are broken or stripped off. When it is trans- 
planted, there will not be at first enough feeding roots to 
supply food and water to all the leaves. The top of the 
tree should, therefore, be cut back to balance the loss of 
roots. The cutting off of some of the limbs is called 
pruning. Most fruit trees at the time of transplanting 
have to be severely pruned in order (1) to keep the leaf 
surface balanced with the feeding roots, and (2) to cause 
the tree to grow in the desired shape. 
Shaping the young tree.— When young apple and peach 
trees are not pruned the central shoot grows more rapidly 
than the side branches. This forms a tall, slender tree, 
with few limbs, which bend and break when heavily loaded 
with fruit. Much of the fruit on unpruned trees is borne 
too high to be easily gathered. To prevent these troubles, 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
214 AGRICULTURE 
the young apple or peach tree is cut off at a height of 
16 to 24 inches above the ground. The cutting of the 
central shoot makes the side branches grow 
more rapidly and nearer to the ground. 
The lower limbs should be close to the 
ground in order to shade the body or trunk. 
If the tree is very young and small when 
, transplanted, all the side branches are also 
E cut off close to the main

should be evenly distributed around the 
stem. If the young tree is well grown when 
aaa transplanted, its branches are cut off six to 
Frc. 147.—One eight inches from the main stem (Fig. 146). 
Ree ree Later pruning. — The usual time to prune 
To be pruned as fruit trees is during the latter part of the 
een by the winter. After the transplanted trees have 
5 been growing for about one year in the 
orchard, they usually need to be pruned again. All of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
  FRUITS 215 
threc to five side branches already selected for growth should 
be cut back until only about eight to twelve inches of their 
new growth is left (Fig.147). At the end of each year the 
new peach twigs, if they have made much growth, will 
need to be cut back to about half their length. Every 
winter cut out from any kind of fruit tree all the branches 
that are partly broken, too close together, or growing across 
the center of the tree, and all twigs that are diseased. 
The later pruning of trees is chiefly (1) to regulate the 
shape, (2) to make the center of 
the tree open enough to admit the 
light, and (3) to thin the fruit. 
Wherever a branch is removed,. 
the cut surface must be left smooth 
and as close to the parent branch 
as possible. No projection or stub 
must be left. A smooth, close 
wound is soon healed and covered 
over; but a stub is not easily 
covered, and decay starts in such 
a wound (Fig. 148). When alarge 
branch is cut off, the wound should 
be covered with thick white lead 
paint, to keep the germs of decay Fic. 148.— Poor PRuniNG

In pruning a fruit tree the bud left farthest out on the 
branch is the one that will grow most rapidly and become 
the leader. The limbs can be made to bend downward more 
than they naturally would by making the cut just beyond a 
bud which points downward. Likewise the growth can be

Peach trees, grapevines, raspberries,

ing every year. Apple trees need 
less after the first few years, and 
shade and nut trees require very little 
pruning. 
EXERCISE. —Perhaps you can find a 
young peach tree growing wild and can 
practice pruning on this. Ask some one at 
home to show you hew to prune the trees and

they prune in a certain way ; also when they 
prune, and why.

pruned orchard, it may be well worth an excursion to see it, and doubt- 
less its owner will give an exhibition of pruning. Farmers’ Bulletin No.

SHCTION XXXVITG THE CAUSES (OF 
DISEASES OF PLANTS! 
Most plants have a green color and thrive in the light. 
Certain very small plants, called ftin’gi, however, have no 
green color. Among them are the tiny plants that cause 
rotting of fruit, spotting and dying of leaves, rust, and smut 
of grain. Since they have no green substance enabling 
them to use the carbon from the air, they cannot make their 
own living. Instead they draw their nourishment from the 
sap and substances already made by green plants. There- 
fore they rob the plants on which they grow and cause 
various diseases, which may affect the leaves, stems, or 
fruits of useful plants. 
Molds.— Among the fungi are certain molds. Fruit 
mold, or bread mold, is made up of a mass of fine white 
threads, some of the short branches of which bear tiny 
black heads. These contain the spores, dust-like bodies 
from which another crop of fungi grows. Spores are to 
fungi what seeds are to plants. The spores of mold and 
of most fungi are so small and light that they are blown 
everywhere by the wind. This explains why plant diseases 
are so “catching,” or contagious. 
Some fungi cannot grow through the skin of fruits, but 
need to have their spores planted in cuts or bruises. 
Other kinds are able to force their way through the skin. 
Very often they push in through the “gateways” or

use.
-P-A-G-E-229
  THE CAUSES OF DISEASES OF PLANTS 219 
Killing fungi with poisons. — Fortunately the spores of 
most kinds of plant diseases will not grow in contact with 
certain substances. Two of the best of these chemicals 
used to destroy fungus spores are bluestone (copper sul- 
fate) and formalin. The buds, the fruit, or the leaves 
are sprayed with a mixture containing bluestone. If this 
is done before the fungus plant has passed through the 
skin of the fruit, the crop is often saved. Seeds of oats 
from a smutty crop are dampened with formalin to kill the 
spores on the seed. The white mildew on the leaves of 
the rose is easily killed by sprinkling on it a solution of 
one ounce of liver of sulfur to two gallons of water. 
Prevention of plant diseases easier than cure. —In most 
cases, however, it is useless to try to cure plant diseases 
by treatment after the fungi have entered the green plant, 
where no poisons can reach them. Spraying fruit trees is 
done to prevent, and not to cure, diseases. The poison 
generally used to ward off diseases of fruit trees, Irish 
potatoes, and others is Bordeaux mixture, which contains 
bluestone (see Appendix). 
Weak plants become diseased. — Plants that are thrifty 
and well nourished are less apt to catch certain plant 
diseases than those that are weak, starved, or unwisely 
fertilized. There are many diseases of plants that are not 
due to germs. These are generally due to poor drainage 
or other unfavorable conditions of soil or climate. Such 
diseases are not contagious. 
Fungous diseases spread rapidly because of the light 
spores, which are blown or carried great distances. 
Nearly all the peaches in an orchard may be ruined by rot
-P-A-G-E-230
220 AGRICULTURE 
during a few weeks of damp weather, which makes most 
germs of plant diseases grow more rapidly. No matter 
how damp the weather, there will be no peach-rot unless 
the spores or seed bodies are first sown. A few fungi are 
useful. Some kinds sour milk so that it can be churned 
into butter; others, called yeasts, cause flour bread to rise ; 
while still other kinds are necessary in making vinegar. 
EXERCISE. — Secure some half-ripe sound peaches and piace two or 
three of these under tumblers. At the same time find one which is de- 
cayed and shows upon the surface tufts of a gray mold. Now witha 
pocket knife touch the mold tufts of the diseased fruit and make cuts 
in the healthy peaches. Wrap the scratched peaches ina damp news- 
paper and put them under a can or cup in a warm place. Do they rot?

One day a brown spot may appear on a fruit, and the 
next the whole fruit may be browned and decayed. Mean- 
time there may appear on the surface numerous gray 
tufts of the mold-like fungus spores (Fig. 152). These 
light spores are carried by 
wind and insects to adja- 
cent healthy fruits or even 
to fruits of distant trees.

ease, called brown-rot.

it may cause the little apples to fall. In ordinary seasons 
this disease is well controlled by spraying at intervals of 
two weeks with Bordeaux mixture. 
Bitter-rot of the apple. — As the name implies, an apple 
attacked by this disease has a bitter taste.  Bitter-rot is 
worst in moist, warm 
weather. It begins as 
a small spot and rapidly 
spreads from fruit to 
fruit. Later the affected 
area becomes flattened 
or sunken. A few days 
after the rot has begun, 
there are little circles of 
black dots beginning to 
appear at the center 
of the diseased spot. 
These little dots contain 
the spores which will 
spread the disease. This

It is estimated that bitter-rot of apples has repeatedly 
caused damage to the extent of ten million dollars a year. 
It may be controlled by the use of Bordeaux mixture. 
Fire-blight of the pear and apple tree.— The common 
blight of pear and apple trees, which kills and blackens 
the leaves and sometimes kills the pear tree, is caused by 
germs, called dacteria. This disease also kills the blo-

soms. The germ. is usually carried by bees from a 
diseased tree to a healthy flower of pear or apple. The 
fungus grows into the flower and on into the twigs. The 
diseased twigs die. Pear-blight, unlike most diseases, does 
least harm to trees that are growing slowly and thus form- 
ing tough, short twigs. Hence, when a grown pear tree 
is attacked, cultivation may be stopped, and no fertilizer 
rich in nitrogen should then be used. 
Spraying is not a cure, but cutting in winter and through- 
out the growing season all the diseased twigs helps to con- 
trol the disease. Cut the twigs about one foot below the 
diseased portion. After making each cut kill any germs 
that may have lodged on the blade of the pruning shears 
or knife. Do this by dipping the blade into a solution 
of formalin or of carbolic acid or by wiping it on a cloth 
dampened in a poisonous solution. Thus you will avoid 
spreading the disease. 
EXERCISE. — Find, examine, and show to your classmates specimens 
of peach “mummies,” rotting peaches or plums, diseased apples, curled 
peach leaves, or spotted leaves of any fruit tree. Do the appearances 
suggest that you are looking at the diseases here described? 
NOTE TO THE TEACHER.— Most State Experiment Stations will 
identify diseased leaves or other specimens addressed to their bota- 
nists and will furnish bulletins on plant diseases or tell you where to 
get the bulletins that you may desire.

SECTION XXXIX. DISEASES OF OATS AND 
WHEAT 
In a field of ripening oats we can generally find 
some blackened smutty heads. The black dust which flies 
when these are touched consists of spores, whose only 
business is to cause more smut in next year’s crop. 
They lodge on healthy oat grains in the field or while 
the crop is being thrashed. Healthy grains on which 
smut spores lodge do not become unhealthy, but when 
planted they carry the smut spores close to the sprouting 
plants. 
Oat-smut.— The only time when the smut fungus of 
oats can enter into the oat plant is just at the time of 
sprouting. If the smut spores can be destroyed on the 
seed to be planted, not a single head of smut will appear 
in the field, and the yield of oats will be increased six to 
twenty-five per cent. These germs on the seed can be 
killed either-with scalding water or with formalin. Do 
this by soaking the seed for ten minutes in hot water that 
a thermometer shows to be between 132 and 135 degrees. 
Or smut may be entirely prevented by thoroughly wetting 
the seed oats in water to which one ounce of formalin has 
been added for every three gallons of water. After treat- 
ing seeds with formalin keep them moist and covered with 
cloth for about two hours, so that gases from the formalin 
225 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
226 AGRICULTURE 
may better kill the smut spores. This treatment costs 
only a cent or two for each bushel of seed. Oat-smut is 
shown in Fig. 155. 
Concealed smut of wheat.—The wheat smut which is 
  Fie. 155. 
Smutry Oats most injurious is not readily observed. Here, 
too, the spores of the fungus replace the kernel, 
but the seed-coats, or kernel coverings, conceal 
the disease. On crushing one of the diseased 
“kernels” the spores will be found and the 
unpleasant odor that arises will not be for- 
gotten. Concealed smut may be prevented by 
dipping or soaking the seeds in a solution of 
bluestone. 
Other diseases. — Among other diseases of 
wheat and oats are several forms of rust, also 
due to fungi. You may be able to find speci- 
mens of rust and to compare them with the 
smuts. 
No treatment has been found to prevent the 
rusts of grain. Some varieties are more injured 
by rust than others. Those that ripen early 
oftenest escape severe injury. If you should 
find a wheat or oat plant that is free from rust 
while all others around it are diseased, your 
discovery may give rise to a genuine rust-proof 
variety. 
EXERCISE.— When wheat or oats have formed heads, count the 
number of smutted heads on a square foot or square yard of surface. 
Estimate how much the yield will probably be reduced by smut. Are 
the other stems ever stunted ona plant having one diseased head? Look 
for rusted leaves or stems of wheat or oats.

NOTE TO THE TEACHER. — If you can get the promise of some farmer 
to sow half an acre of smutty oat seed and an acre alongside with seeds 
that have been treated for smut, your State Experiment Station may 
possibly be able to send you the necessary formalin. Or you can ask 
certain pupils simply with the aid of a borrowed thermometer to scald 
the seed for this test. If you have a school garden, plant in it treated 
and untreated oat seed. Let different pupils plant the two kinds of 
seed, so that disease germs may not be carried from the untreated to 
the treated seed.

  SECTION ML. DISEASES OF} IRISH AND 
SWEET POTATOES 
The scab of Irish potatoes. —Irish potatoes often have a 
surface covered with rough scabs. This is a fungous dis- 
ease. Ifa scabby potato is planted, both fungus and po- 
tato are sown and the harvest will consist of both. More- 
over, the fungus spores are apt to be present in a soil which 
has recently produced scabby potatoes, ready to injure the 
next crop of potatoes. Fortunately this disease is easily 
prevented. A sound crop comes from smooth, healthy 
potatoes in a soil where scabby potatoes have never grown. 
For safety treat seed potatoes by soaking them two hours 
in a formalin solution containing one ounce of formalin to 
two gallons of water. : 
The early blight.— This is a common disease of the leaves 
of the Irish potato. Round brown spots appear upon the 
leaves, or irregular spots show on the margins. This dis- 
ease is readily prevented by spraying the foliage with 
Bordeaux mixture. Paris green may be added to the mix- 
ture so as to poison the potato beetle at the same time. 
The soft-rot of sweet potatoes. — Sweet potatoes in stor- 
age are sometimes injured by the same little black mold 
often found growing on bread or on preserves. When the 
potatoes are stored where it is too moist and warm, this 
fungus grows upon them and produces what is known as 
228
-P-A-G-E-239
DISEASES OF IRISH AND SWEET POTATOES 229 
the soft-rot, which has an unpleasant odor. This fungus 
takes advantage of the so-called sweating period, which 
occurs a short time after the sweet potatoes are dug. It 
then finds an easy entrance through the injuries on the sur- 
face or through the broken end of the root. From a single 
diseased or bruised spot it may spread with alarming 
rapidity. This disease is readily prevented by proper dry- 
ing of the potatoes for a few days after they are dug, be- 
fore placing them in the lower temperature at which they 
are to be stored. Infected potatoes should be destroyed. 
The black-rot of sweet potatoes. — This disease is really 
a soil rot. The fungus doubtless enters through the 
young rootlets of the growing plant. It finally becomes 
established in the potatoes themselves, producing circular 
black patches. The disease may even extend its injuries 
after the potatoes are stored. Black-rot is the most de- 
structive fungous enemy of the sweet potato, but fortunately 
it has not been found in all localities. In order to control 
it, the potatoes should not’ be grown on any field where 
sweet potatoes grew for one or two years before. More- 
over, the seed or slip bed should be carefully watched, for

Many of the plants killed or stunted by wilt. 
plants die when bearing a full load of blooms and bolls. The 
disease occurs chiefly in the southern half of the cotton belt, 
and as far west as Louisiana. It is very common on certain

of the islands on the South Atlantic coast where Sea Island 
cotton is produced. 
The first year that wilt occurs on a field it attacks only 
a single plant or a small spot here and there. The next 
year the spots where the plants die are larger. In a very 
few years the fungus may become so very widespread as 
to make it impossible to maintain a stand of cotton on 
any part of the field (Fig. 156). 
In the stem of a cotton plant that has been attacked by 
wilt, the woody portion is darkened or streaked with very 
fine black lines. These black lines are the water-carrying 
vessels that have become stopped up by the growth of the 
fungus. Their stoppage causes the plant 
to wilt for lack of water. A dark layer 
occurs just under the bark (Fig. 157). 
The germs of the disease enter the plant 
through the roots. Cotton wilt is gener- 
ally considered worse on land where the 
tiny worms that produce knots on the 
roots are present. The germs probably 
enter more readily through the wounds 
made by these root-knot worms on the Fic. 157.— Draconat

withstand the attacks of, this fungus. The Dixie (Fig. 
158), some strains of the Jackson variety, and some 
varieties of Sea Island cotton have been made quite re- 
sistant to cotton wilt by years of selection. 
Rotation of crops is generally the way to decrease 
the damage from 
wilt. However, 
the germs of wilt 
live in the soil 
for several years.

root-knot worms, if present, increase rapidly on the cow- 
pea roots. This increases the number of wounds on the 
cotton roots the next year, and hence probably the 
number of wilt fungi entering the cotton plant. But 
in a rotation of crops on such a field, the variety of 
cowpeas called Iron, and also the velvet bean, may well 
be grown, because the root-knot worms do not rapidly in- 
crease on the roots of these plants. 
Cotton root rot.— The farmers of Texas and Oklahoma 
are not troubled with cotton wilt. Instead, their cotton 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
  DISEASES OF COTTON 233 
often suffers from another disease, which, in appearance, 
is very similar to the wilt. This is the well-known root 
rot, or “dying” of cotton, The symptoms of this disease 
also are sudden wilting followed by the death and brown- 
ing of the whole stalk. Plants die from this disease about 
the time that the first 
bolls begin to open. 
It seems to be most 
common in the black- 
waxy, and other stiff 
soils. 
The method of its 
attack is very different 
from that of the cotton 
wilt. Over the whole 
root system, and par- 
ticularly covering the 
larger roots, are found 
brownish yellow 
threads, or a fuzzy 
growth of the fungus.

bark and even extend py Root ARON 
into the wood of the roots; the younger roots are 
promptly killed (Fig. 159). Wilting is due to the failure 
of the roots to furnish the usual supply of water. 
The fungus has. been found on practically all varieties 
of cotton, but methods have been discovered for lessen- 
ing the loss. It grows best and injures cotton most

where the soil contains little air, that is, where the soil 
packs down heavily, or where the land has been poorly 
prepared for the growth of cotton. Therefore, better cir- 
culation of air in the soil is needed. This can be attained 
by deep plowing, thorough cultivation, and the addition of 
stable manure or vegetable. matter. Rotation of crops is 
necessary. Such a rotation should not include alfalfa, 
sweet potatoes, or other plants on which this fungus can 
live. On land where cotton root rot occurs, corn, the small 
grains, sorghum, the true grasses, and many other similar 
crops may be grown. 
Cotton boll rot.— The boll rot is a very common disease 
in moist seasons. It is most severe in moist bottom lands 
where the large plants shade the ground and the bolls. 
The careful observer will notice first upon the boll small 
water-soaked spots, and as these spots increase in size 
they become gray at the center and finally pink, with a 
purple border. The pink or gray coating is evidence of 
the abundant production of fungus spores. These spores 
are blown about, or spread by insects, thus planting the 
disease wherever they fall upon cotton bolls surrounded 
by sufficient moisture and warmth to make the spores 
develop. The boll rots and the contents are ruined. 
Varieties differ somewhat in the extent to which they 
take the disease. Wide spaces between rows may de- 
crease boll rot by letting in more sunlight. 
Black rust.—This is the disease that so generally 
causes the cotton plant gradually to drop its leaves. 
The leaves turn pale or yellow, and then blacken and 
die. Black rust is not started by germs. After a plant
-P-A-G-E-245
DISEASES OF COTTON 235 
has been made weak and unhealthy by unfavorable soil or 
other surroundings, the rust fungus enters the leaves and 
completes their destruction. Rust is largely a disease of 
poor land, and can be prevented on some soils by adding 
vegetable matter or potash. 
Exercise. — Ask your parents which of these diseases occur near 
your home. On what kinds of soil is each one worst? If diseased 
plants are found, examine them in the field where they grow. Do not 
take them to school for fear of spreading the disease. 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
  SECTION XLII. GERMS IN THE SOIL 
Tue farmer could not grow profitable crops without the 
help of several kinds of germs that live in the soil. Some 
of these live in the tubercles on the roots of leguminous 
plants and change the nitrogen of the air into fertilizer 
nitrogen. These might be called the nitrogen-trapping 
germs because they catch or trap the nitrogen gas. 
Nitrate-forming germs. — Other kinds of bacteria that 
work faithfully for the farmer may be called the nitrate- 
forming germs. These finally change certain compounds 
in vegetable matter in the soil into vz¢rates, the only form 
in which most plants can use nitrogen. The heaviest 
growth of cowpeas or clover might be plowed under as fer- 
tilizer, and the plants growing on that field the next season 
could not use a pound of its nitrogen if there were no 
nitrate-forming germs. These germs are too small to see, 
so small indeed that many millions have been found in a 
thimbleful of soil. The farmer should care for these tiny 
useful plants that are helping him to grow larger crops. 
Helping our friends in the soil.— Men who have spent 
their lives in studying these tiny plants under powerful 
microscopes have found that what the nitrate-forming 
germs need in order to increase rapidly and to help the 
soil and the crop are the following : — 
236 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
GERMS IN THE SOIL 237 
(1) An abundance of vegetable matter for the germs to 
feed on and to change into fertilizer. 
(2) A soil that is always moist, but well drained. 
(3) A soil kept so loose and well drained that air can 
circulate in it. 
(4) An abundance of lime to keep the soil from. becom- 
. ing sour. 
(5) A warm temperature. 
Germ enemies in the soil. — The soil is not dead. It 
swarms with living creatures. Some are friends, some foes. 
If the farmer helps the friendly germs, they rapidly in- 
crease and almost drive out some of the harmful germs. 
But if he allows his land to remain long very wet or very 
compact or very deficient in vegetable matter, his enemies 
in the soil will increase to enormous numbers and his 
friends will be banished. 
Nitrate destroyers. — For example, there are germs that 
are harmful because they change the valuable nitrates into 
useless nitrogen gas. Thus they undo the good work that 
the nitrate-forming germs have done These harmful 
kinds, or nitrate destroyers, do not thrive in a soil where 
there is plenty of air. The farmer must fight these by the 
means that help the friendly germs, by drainage, plowing, 
cultivation, and by the addition of vegetable matter.

SECTION XLII]. WHAT AN INSECT IS? 
Many persons regard insects only as troublesome pests, 
always to be considered as enemies, To the farmer, how- 
ever, a large majority of the insects are really not enemies. 
Many of them are his friends, although others are serious 
enemies of health and crops. All of them are interesting, 
and some of them very beautiful. A few general facts 
about aiding our insect friends and destroying our insect 
enemies will be of value. 
What an insect is. Three great divisions are made to 
include all natural things, that is, the axima/, the vegetable, 
and the mineral kingdoms. All insects belong to the 
animal kingdom. They are, therefore, animals, of which 
class they form much the largest group. In fact, there are 
more kinds of insects than of all other animals and of all 
plants put together. It is the abundance of insects and 
their close relationship to our health and welfare that 
make it so important for us to study them. 
Insects are never very large and rarely exceed a few 
inches in length or breadth. Many of them are so small 
that a magnifying glass or lens is needed to see them 
clearly. Most insects have wings when they are in the 
full-grown or adu/t stage, but some never have these in any 
1 The sections on insects [XLIII to XLIX, inclusive] were written by Dr. 
VW’. F. Hinds, Professor of Entomology in Alabama Polytechnic Institute.

-P-A-G-E-249
  WHAT AN INSECT IS 239 
stage of their existence. When wings are present, there 
may be either one or two pairs. Nearly all insects have 
legs; six is the usual number. These two characteristics, 
the presence of wings and of six legs, are sufficient to identify 
an insect. There are insects, however, that lack wings 
and legs. 
Spiders and mites not insects. —The only creatures likely 
to be mistaken for insects are the spzders and mites. These 
never have wings and always have eight legs. By simply 
counting legs, then, spiders may be separated from the 
wingless insects. 
The principal parts of an insect. — The body is divided 
into three parts: the ead, the thorax, and the abdé!men 
(Fig. 160). The head bears the eyes, the 
antén'ne, or feelers, and the month 
parts. To the ¢hd'rax, or chest, of the 
insect are attached the wags and the 
fegs, but both wings and legs are en- 
tirely wanting in some insects. 
The eyes and antennz.— The eye is 
made up of a large number of simple 
eyes, so closely crowded together that 
they form what is called a compound 
eye. Asa whole it is shaped somewhat 
like half a raspberry, dewberry, or blackberry. The shape 
of each part of the eye is something like that of a cell in 
honeycomb. 
  Fic. 160 .— THE Parts 
OF AN INSECT 
The antennz bear the sense organs, which correspond to 
our fouch, smell, and probably hearing also. One reason 
why the name “ feelers” is often applied to these organs is
-P-A-G-E-250
240 AGRICULTURE 
because the insects really seem to use them in that way. 
Insects do not have a nose or ears as we have, but some of 
them have the sense of smell very wonderfully developed, 
and doubtless they hear many sounds that never reach our 
ears. There are many interesting differences in the form 
of the antennez in different insects. 
Wings and legs. — The wings serve to carry their owners 
over long distances. They are very important aids in en- 
abling insects to find their food. A bee could not get 
enough to eat if it had no wings to carry it from flower to 
flower. The legs are arranged so as to balance the body 
in walking. Having six legs, the insect always has three 
on the ground while it is moving the other three forward. 
EXeErCIsE. — Catch a fly and see whether you find all of the parts of 
the body which have been mentioned. How many pairs of wings has 
it? If you can get a magnifying glass examine the eye, antenna, mouth, 
and feet. Describe what you see. 
Note TO THE TEACHER. — The United States Department of Agri- 
culture and most of the experiment stations have issued bulletins on 
injurious insects. The text and illustrations in these will be useful to 
you in teaching the sections on insects.
-P-A-G-E-251
SECTION XLIV. HOW INSECTS GROW 
One difference between the structure of insects and 
four-legged animals is that the insects have their skele- 
ton or bones, as we may call them, on the outside of 
their bodies. This is what makes an insect hard. For 
this reason, insects cannot grow slowly and steadily, as 
animals do that have their skeletons inside and covered 
with the soft and easily stretched muscles and skin. 
When insects grow they do so by sudden jumps, as it 
were. When they have grown so that they fill their out- 
side skins very tightly, a new skeleton is formed inside 
of the old; the old skeleton bursts and is shed by the 
insect. While the new skeleton is yet soft it allows a con- 
siderable growth of the insect. This process is repeated 
several times in the life of every insect before it becomes 
fully grown. Having the skeleton on the outside is a great 
protection to the insect. 
With some insects these changes of skeleton are ac- 
companied only by a change in the size from the newly 
hatched form to the adult; but with others there are 
great changes in structure and appearance during the 
last two changes of skin. We must know something of 
these changes in order to recognize the different stages 
in the life of the same insect. 
Immature and adult forms of insects. — Among the in- 
sects that change but little with their development are 
241
-P-A-G-E-252
  242 AGRICULTURE 
the grasshoppers and the true bugs. Those who study 
insects use the name “bug” only for a certain large group 
of insects, just as one would speak of the “ flies,” “bees,” 
and “grasshoppers.” Grasshoppers and bugs have the 
same general form of body when young, but acquire 
wings as they become adult. Most of the other common 
insects undergo very remarkable changes. It is important 
to know this, since it may be very difficult to destroy an 
insect in one stage, but very easy to do so in another. 
Among those that make great changes in form are all of 
the caterpillars, which become butterflies or moths when 
full grown; the maggots, 
which become flies; the 
grubs, which become beetles. 
You will find it exceedingly 
interesting to watch a cater- 
pillar change its skin or the 
butterfly emerge from its 
chrysalis or pupal case.

Stages in an insect’s life. —In the life of most insects 
there are four well-defined stages. The first is the egg, the 
second is the /arva, the third is the pupa, and the fourth
-P-A-G-E-253
  
HOW INSECTS GROW 243 
stage is the adult (Figs. 161, 167). With a few insects 
there is no visible egg stage, as the young are born alive. 
This is the case with the plant-lice. The larval stage 
is the growing stage in every insect’s life. If it is not 
well fed, the adult inscct coming from it will be smaller 
in size than usual. The pupa, or pupal stage, occurs only 
among insects in which the larva is very different from the 
adult. It is purely a ¢vans- 
formation stage, and is one 
of the most wonderful facts 
in the life of any animal. 
Transtormation from cater- 
pillar to butterfly.— When 
the butterfly caterpillar has 
become fully grown, it ceases 
to feed and seeks scme pro- 
tected spot in which to trans- 
form. For a time it seems 
to shrink or shrivel as though 
about to die. The most won- 
derful thing, perhaps, is that 
through all the vital changes 
that take place within its 
body during this period it re pine Ua ate aed 
does not die. After a few Cage used to confine insects when study- 
days, the caterpillar sheds ang thete Babits: 
its larval skin and becomes the pretty, shining chrysalis, 
or pupal case, of the butterfly. This is generally attached 
to some twig or stem. The surface is marked with 
delicate lines which really indicate the outlines of the 
   
-P-A-G-E-254
244 AGRICULTURE 
sheaths within which the wings, legs, and antenne are 
developing. The body of the caterpillar is made over into 
an entirely new set of structures especially fitted for the 
different life the adult will lead. A wonderful change 
takes place in both the structure and the habits during the 
two stages of these insects’ lives. A new butterfly is 
formed out of the body of the old caterpillar without de- 
stroying its life. This is just what happens with most 
insects. With moths the changes are very similar, only 
they are hidden from view by the cocoon, or silken case, 
that the caterpillar spins around itself for protection dur- 
ing this critical time of life. The change with wasps and 
bees and beetles is just as great as with butterflies and 
moths. 
EXERCISE. — Bring some potato beetles to the school and confine 
them in a cage such as shown in Fig. 162, with some of the potato 
vines. Watch the adult beetles lay their eggs and.the young hatch 
and grow. Have some earth in the bottom of the cage for the larva 
to enter when they are ready to transform. After a few days dig out 
some of the pupz and see how differently they are formed from the 
mature insects that were put in.
-P-A-G-E-255
SECTION XLV. HOW INSECTS FEED 
How insects feed. — Insect mouth-parts are fitted for 
either dzting or for sucking food. 
Insects have a number of parts to their jaws, and these 
are soarranged that they work sidewise against each other. 
The biting insects consume the entire substance of the 
leaves, flowers, fruit, or wood on which they feed. This 
is the reason that it is possible to kill such insects by 
applying some poison to the plants on which they are 
feeding. 
Some biting insects, however, feed in protected places 
where it is impossible to reach their food with a poison 
application. This is the case with the wood-boring in- 
sects as a rule and with the cotton-boll weevil. Many of 
the leaf-feeding insects, even, feed in the buds or some 
other protected position that makes it hard to control them. 
It is, therefore, necessary to know both the structure of 
the mouth and something of the general feeding habits of 
each insect before it can be destroyed. 
Different uses of biting mouth-parts. — Among the bit- 
ing insects the jaws are arranged in two principal positions, 
either pointing downward toward the surface upon which 
the insect rests, or forward, straight ahead of the insect. 
These positions indicate a different use. When the jaws 
point downward it means, as a rule, that the insect feeds 
245 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
  246 AGRICULTURE 
upon the surface or substance upon which it rests. This 
is the case with the grasshoppers, caterpillars, and most 
other leaf-feeding insects. Where the jaws point forward, 
it indicates that they are used for catching prey or for 
boring into wood. Those insects which catch others are 
as a rule useful and should not be destroyed. The ¢iger 
beetles and the dadydirds are two important groups of such 
useful insects. 
Sucking insects.—In the second large group are in- 
cluded all insects that take their food by sucking. The 
mosquitoes, flies, butterflies, moths, and bugs are insects 
of this class. The food of sucking insects is generally 
either plant sap or animal blood. The butterflies and 
moths, however, use neither of these foods, but live on the 
nectar, or sweet liquid, which is formed in flowers. Some 
adult insects never feed at all. The larve from which 
they are developed have stored up so much strength and 
a surplus of food materials in their body tissues that the 
adult simply lives upon that reserve. In such cases the 
adult may have entirely lost the use of its mouth and 
the parts may not be developed. Such insects are usually 
short-lived while in the adult stage. Among the mosquitoes 
only the females suck blood. It is possible for them to 
live on some other food as well as upon blood. 
Perhaps the most interesting form of sucking mouth is 
that of the butterflies and moths. All caterpillars have 
biting mouths. The ¢ongue of the butterfly is often longer 
than its body. It would be very much in the way if it 
were not possible for its owner to coil it up like a watch- 
spring and carry it closely packed away under its head.
-P-A-G-E-257
  HOW INSECTS. FEED 247 
There is a narrow channel extending through the entire 
length of this tongue through which the butterfly sucks 
the liquids that serve it as food. 
With most sucking insects the mouth-parts are strong 
enough to enable them to pierce the tissues of plants, 
animals, or other insects, so that their food is obtained 
entirely from beneath the surface. This is the reason 
that zt zs impossible to, kill sucking insects by applying 
poisons to the plants on which they are feding. 
Different treatments for biting and for sucking incects. 
— These types of mouth-parts must be well understood in 
deciding just what treatment should be given for any 
insect pest. With the biting leaf-eating insects, any poison 
spread on the surface of the leaves will be taken into the 
insect’s stomach with its fo0d and cause its death. Paris 
green is the principal poison that is used in this way. It 
is generally mixed with water and the poisoned solution 
sprayed all over the trees or plants on which leaf-eating 
insects are feeding. Other poisons may be used in the 
same way. Such a treatment will have no effect upon the 
sap-sucking insects that take nothing from the surface 
of the leaves. It has never been found possible to in- 
troduce any poison into the sap of a plant so as to destroy 
the sucking insects upon it. The principal thing that 
can be done to destroy such insects is to apply something 
which will not injure the plant, but which, coming into 
contact with theinsect’s body, will cause its death. There 
are two kinds of such treatment that can be used. The 
first kind includes many substances which cause death by 
covering with soap or with oil the openings through which  
-P-A-G-E-258
    
248 AGRICULTURE 
the insect breathes, which keep out the air and really 
suffocate it. These are called contact insecticides. Kero- 
sene emulsion is one of the most common of such sub- 
stances. (See Appendix.) The second class includes 
those gases that are either poisonous in themselves or 
cause the death of the insect by replacing the air and 
thus causing suffocation. 
EXERCISE. — Watch caterpillars feeding on foliage, and mosquitoes 
and flies sucking blood or sweets, and describe what you see them do.

SECTION XLVI. INSECT ENEMIES OF THE 
FARMER 
Wuite the injurious kinds number but a very small 
fraction of the great group of insects, they are exceed- 
ingly important both to our wealth and health. Perhaps 
more than a tenth of all the crops raised each year in our 
entire country is eaten or destroyed by insects. This 
damage amounts to a direct cost of about ten dollars for 
every man, woman, and child in the United States. 
The Hessian fly.— Perhaps the most injurious species 
of all is the Hessian fly, a minute insect which lives on 
the stems of wheat and other grains. In some places 
wheat cannot be grown because of the presence of this 
insect and the injury it causes. The only remedy con- 
sists in burning over the stubble after the crop has been 
harvested and in delaying the planting of the fall wheat 
until after frosts have occurred. 
The chinch-bug. — This is another very important insect 
that attacks grains. It is especially injurious to wheat and 
corn. It is a true bug and hardly more than a fifth of an 
inch long. Chinch-bugs often occur in such numbers as 
to cause the death of the plants because of the enormous 
amount of sap they withdraw. After the crops of small- 
grain are harvested, these bugs move on foot in countless 
numbers to the corn-fields. The fields can be protected 
2 249
-P-A-G-E-260
250 AGRICULTURE 
by running a deep furrow across the path of the bugs and 
destroying them as they fall into it. The fields should be 
cleaned by burning all rubbish which can shelter the adult 
bugs through the winter. With many such pests, it is ad- 
visable to change the crop on a field each year, so that the 
pests may not so readily find an abundance of their food. 
  Fic. 164.—Appre Worm or Copiinc-MotH 
The moth or miller lays the egg, from which hatches the 
larva or worm. 
The apple worm or codling moth.— A widespread pest 
of apples is the worm (Fig. 164) that works into the core 
and makes the fruit “wormy.” This is the larva of a 
pretty moth that lays its eggs on the leaves of the apple 
soon after the blossoming time. The young larve feed on 
the leaves before they enter the fruit, into which they 
bore their way. This is the reason why it is possible to 
kill nearly all of the young worms by applying a poisonous 
ne

INSECT ENEMIES OF THE FARMER 251 
spray, which usually contains Paris green, at about the time 
that the petals drop from the blossoms. A second spraying 
in from ten days to three weeks after the first is an almost 
complete remedy for this pest. The expense is very slight 
in comparison with the value of the crop saved. 
The peach borer.—One of the most important peach 
insects is the peach borer, which works, not upon the fruit, 
but in the trees. If constant care be not taken, these 
borers may destroy a valuable orchard in a few years. 
The adult is a beautiful little moth, resembling some of 
the wasps in its appearance. The eggs are laid by the 
parent moths during the summer upon the bark near 
the surface of the ground. After hatching, the larva 
begins to bore into the bark, working downward a little 
below the surface. It lives thereafter in the sap-carrying 
layers just under the bark. Its presence is marked by an 
abundant formation of gum. The usual and best remedy 
is to dig around the base of each tree early in the fall or 
winter, and if any signs of gum are found, to dig out and 
destroy the larvae or worms. This must be done carefully 
so as not to miss any of the worms or injure the trees 
more by digging than the worms would do if left alone. 
The San José scale. — This is one of the most important 
enemies of all fruit trees that shed their leaves. It is called 
the San José (H6’sa) scale because it was first found in the 
United States near a place in California by that name. 
The scale insects are true bugs and suck the sap from the 
trees. The adult female, scales are hardly as large as pin 
heads, but they may occur so abundantly as to cover the 
bark completely, and to cause the death of large trees in a

The potato beetle. — This insect occurs so 
commonly that it is probably well known to 
all of you. The adult beetle is marked with 
ten light and dark stripes. The young are 
thick-bodied, soft, red grubs. They eat the 
vines of the Irish potato and the mature 
beetles do likewise. The beetle lives over 
winter and lays its eggs upon the potato 
plants early in the season. The eggs hatch 
into small reddish grubs and in a few weeks 
the vines may be eaten bare. The remedy 
for this pest is Paris green, sprayed or dusted 
on the leaves. Lime should generally be 
used with Paris green to prevent its injuring 
the leaves. 
The plum curculio.— This is another beetle 
that does great damage to the plum and 
peach crops. The adult is one of the snout 
beetles, or weevils. After the fruit has set, 
the mother weevil lays her eggs in it and 
then eats a crescent-shaped cut half around 
each egg in order that the growth of the 
fruit may not crush the egg before it hatches. This al- 
ways marks the location of the egg. The larva eats its 
way into the fruit and around the stone. When fully 
 
-P-A-G-E-263
INSECT ENEMIES OF THE FARMER 253 
grown, it leaves the fruit and goes into the ground to 
transform. The adult weevil comes out early in the spring 
and feeds for a time on the buds before the fruit is set. 
During this period it may be destroyed by spraying the 
opening buds with poison. If sprayed just after blos- 
soming, many weevils will be killed before they injure 
the fruit. 
Another method of destroying the weevils depends 
upon their habit of dropping to the ground for protection 
if anything dis- 
turbs the tree. 
A cloth-covered

SECTION XLVII. THE MEXICAN COTTON- 
BOLL WEEVIL 
In the Southern states where cotton is grown, the most 
Important insect for you to know about is the Merican cot- 
5 ton-boll weevil. This 
insect (Fig. 168) 
feeds only upon cot- 
ton, but its injury to 
this is very serious. 
It came into the 
United States from 
Mexico about 1892, 
and has since spread 
throughout most of 
the cotton-growing 
portions of Texas and 
Louisiana, and over 
the southern parts of 
Oklahoma and Ar- 
kansas. During the 
fall of 1907 it crossed

ties of Mississippi. It is very certain to continue its spread 
throughout the other cotton-growing states. The injury

that it is doing now can scarcely be estimated at less than 
twenty-five million dollars a year.

small, and are laid in a hole which the female eats in the 
square or boll. After placing the egg at the bottom of 
the hole, the opening to it is sealed air-tight by the mother 
weevil so that the egg will not dry up and fail to hatch. 
Each female may lay more than a hundred and some even

more than two hundred eggs. Only a few days are re. 
quired for these to hatch. 
The larva.— Upon hatching, the little larva, or grub, 
finds itself surrounded by the tender parts of the bud or 
boll and then proceeds to feed and grow. When the larva

nas become about half grown, the injury to the square is 
usually so severe that the little leaf-like parts surrounding 
the bud spread outward and the square turns yellow. In 
about ten days from the time the egg is laid the square 
usually falls to the ground, where the larva continues to

feed within it until fully grown (Fig. 169). This requires 
only about ten to fifteen days. Dry, hot weather may kill 
the insects within the fallen squares, especially if the rows 
of cotton be far enough apart to let in the sunshine. 
The pupa. — Within the shelter of the walls of the fallen
-P-A-G-E-270
  260 AGRICULTURE ~ 
bud or square, or within the boil (which is more likely to 
remain hanging upon the plant), the larva changes to a 
pupa. After only about three days more it becomes a full- 
grown weevil. The weevil then cuts a hole in the sur- 
rounding walls that is just the size of its body, and 
through this makes its escape to the outside world (Fig. 
171). All of its life from the time the egg is laid until 
the mature weevil comes forth is passed in the interior 
of the square or boll. This fact makes it impossible 
to apply any poisons so as to destroy the insect in its 
early stages. 
The adult.— The mature weevil (Fig. 168) is a gray or 
reddish brown insect about a quarter of an inch long, not 
including the long snout. The mouth-parts are very small 
and are at the extreme tip of the long snout. This en- 
ables the weevil to bore deep into the squares and bolls. 
Squares, blooms, and bolls are destroyed by the attacks of 
the mature weevils, by the injury caused by the growing 
grub, and by the decay which starts in such wounds. 
The adults, or weevils, may live for a number of months. 
The development is so rapid that fully five generations 
may reach maturity in a season. Hence the insects are 
most abundant in the late summer and in the fall. The 
only check to the increase of weevils is the absence of 
squares, blooms, and bolls. When the weevils are very 
numerous, they destroy the squares so completely that no 
blooms are formed. 
Spread. — The weevils may be spread in a number of 
ways, especially by seed carried from the gins on the border 
of the region where the weevil is present. To prevent
-P-A-G-E-271
  THE MEXICAN COTTON-BOLL WEEVIL 261 
this, strict rules have been made against the shipment of 
cotton seed or other materials that might carry the weevils. 
The boll weevil spreads chiefly by flying. This flight 
and rapid spread occur during the fall months. In this 
way, the weevil spreads into about fifty miles of new terri- 
tory each season. It is expected to spread over the entire 
cotton belt within a comparatively few years. 
How it passes the winter. — The weevils which reach 
maturity late in the fall are the ones that are most likely to 
live through the winter. Fortunately, only from one to ten 
weevils live through the winter out of every hundred that 
attempt to do so. The weevils that mature in the late fall 
find shelter in the old cotton bolls on the stalk, or under 
any rubbish in or around the fields. The few that survive 
the winter leave their places of shelter gradually during 
a period of from ten to fourteen weeks, as a rule between 
the last of March and the first of July. This gradual 
coming out from winter quarters makes it very difficult to 
do much to control the weevil early in the spring. 
Treatment for the weevil. — This has proved to be a 
very difficult insect to control. No poisons have proved 
of much value in fighting it. It has been found that the 
direct rays of the sun will destroy large numbers of the 
insects while in the immature stages in the fallen squares, 
when they are exposed to it. Some of our native ants, 
which occur all through the cotton-growing area, are very 
valuable helps, because they destroy large numbers of the 
pest in its immature stages. A number of other insects 
attack the immature insects in the squares and bolls and 
destroy them. More than forty species of birds are known
-P-A-G-E-272
262 AGRICULTURE 
to destroy boll weevils. The most important of these are 
the swallows and orioles in summer and blackbirds and 
meadow larks in winter. 
The best way to fight the boll weevil is to make certain 
improvements in farm practice. The most important step 
is to hasten the cotton plant to early maturity, so that the 
bolls formed early in the summer may become well grown 
3 by the time the weevils become very numerous, the 
| middle of July or first of August. The boll weevil does 
| not do much damage to well-grown bolls while there is 
an abundance of squares in which eggs have not already 
been laid. 
The maturity of cotton may be hastened — 
(1) By planting varieties or selections that mature early, 
or that form bolls early in the summer. 
(2) By early planting and frequent and thorough culti- 
vation. 
(3) By the liberal use of fertilizers. . Generally acid 
phosphate hastens the maturing of cotton. 
The farmer who adopts the intensive system of cotton 
culture and who produces two thirds of a bale or more of 
cotton to the acre before the boll weevil reaches him will 
probably be able to grow cotton profitably after this 
insect comes. But the farmer, who before the coming 
of the boll weevil gets only a third of a bale or less 
from an acre, will scarcely be able to continue to grow 
cotton in the old way after the pest reaches him. 
The second step in fighting the boll weevil consists in 
destroying the green parts of the plants or in plowing un- 
der the cotton stalks as early as possible in the fall. This
-P-A-G-E-273
  THE MEXICAN COTTON-BOLL WEEVIL 263 
1s done in order to deprive the weevils of their only food- 
supply, to stop their increase, and to reduce the number of 
hiding places in which they may spend the winter. The 
best preparation for farmers to make for the coming of 
the boll weevil is (1) to become accustomed to growing a 
greater variety of crops and more live-stock, and (2) to 
practice intensive cultivation of cotton, that is, to cultivate 
fewer acres of cotton so thoroughly as to make them pro- 
duce as many bales as were grown on the larger area. 
The only safety lies in diversified farming and intensive 
cotton culture. 
EXERCISE. — Let those who live outside of the region already in- 
vaded by the poll weevil try to estimate by the aid of the maps in some 
geography, how many years will probably pass before the boll weevil 
will reach their county, if it moves forward about fifty miles each year, 
assuming that it starts eastward from the Mississippi River in 1908. 
Do you think that farmers living near you realize that the boll weevil is , 
certainly coming? Are any of them making preparations for its com- 
ing by raising a variety of farm products, — live-stock, truck crops, fruit, 
etc.,— and by raising cotton under the intensive system? Ask your 
parents what additional crops or live-stock, or live-stock products, could 
be produced to advantage in your own neighborhood.
-P-A-G-E-274
  SECTION XLVIII. INSECTS AND HEALTH 
Durine the past few years much has been learned about 
the part that insects play in the spread of various diseases. 
Flies carry disease. — It has been found that flies are 
frequently very important agents in the spreading of 
typhoid fever. They do this by carrying to human food 
on their feet or mouth-parts the germs that cause the dis- 
ease. These germs are brought from the infected matter 
which flies visit. This has been proved by allowing a fly 
which had been on diseased matter to walk across the 
surface of aspecially prepared material in which the germs 
of the disease could live. In a few days it was found that 
the typhoid germs were multiplying at every spot the fly 
had touched. The danger of the spread of such a disease 
by tues can be decreased as follows: (1) the frequent 
use of lime where needed about the premises, so as to re- 
duce the number of flies and thus protect food ; (2) fre- 
quently cleaning stables and lots to keep flies from breeding 
there; and (3) thorough screening of houses. 
Mosquitoes and yellow fever. —It has been proved very 
positively that a certain kind of mosquito is the agent 
in carrying this disease from one person to another. It 
is probable that it is spread in no other way. This mos- 
quito is the common black-and-white-banded day mosquito 
of the Southern states. Before the connection of the 
mosquito with the spread of this disease became known, 
264
-P-A-G-E-275
  INSECTS AND HEALTH 265 
frightful outbreaks of the fever sometimes occurred in the 
South. In Havana, Cuba, it was always present. Even 
there the disease has. been stamped out by. destroying 
the mosquitoes (Fig. 174). 
As these mosquitoes breed very extensively in the cis- 
terns, rain barrels, or other water-holding vessels, the rem- , 
edy evidently consists in removing every unnecessary water 
vessel and in screening those which must remain with wire 
screening or cheese cloth so tightly that the mosquitoes can- 
not get to the water to breed. 
Mosquitoes and malaria. — More important than either 
of the cases which have been mentioned is the relation of 
mosquitoes to the spreading of malaria. That they do this 
has been most positively proved, and it is certain that mala- 
ria is never spread in any other way. The females alone 
do all of this deadly work, as the males never suck blood. 
How malaria is spread. — Malaria is caused by a very 
minute animal that lives as a parasite in the red blood cells 
of man. When a mosquito sucks blood from a person 
who has the disease, the parasites are taken with the blood. 
In the body of the mosquito certain of them undergo a 
development which they never do in man. After about 
ten or twelve days in the mosquito these parasites pass 
through the stomach walls. and gather in its throat. At 
any time after this occurs, when this mosquito bites a well 
person, she is likely to force some of the parasites into the 
person’s body along with the saliva which she injects into 
the wound. In this way, after a fw days or weeks, a new 
case of malaria develops.. This is considered as one of 
the most important recent discoveries in medicine. 
t

Knowing how the disease is spread, it becomes possible 
to prevent it entirely. The malarial regions are simply 
those where the malarial mosquitoes are abundant. It 
has been positively proved that it is possible for people 
to live even in the worst of such regions and yet to keep 
entirely well by guarding against being bitten by the mos- 
quitoes. Their bites can be escaped, for the malarial 
mosquitoes are active only between sunset and sunrise. 
The thorough screening of the 
houses is the most certain means 
of preventing the spread of the 
disease. In addition the draining 
or filling of the standing water 
pools in which the mosquitoes 
breed should be done. Small fish 
live on mosquito wigglers and, 
hence, fish should be kept in 
ponds that cannot be drained or 
filled. 
ate Tit How to know the malarial mos- 
ms Ween cies quitoes. —Whether we desire to de- 
Mosqurro ABOVE stroy or to avoid these mosquitoes, 
we should know how to tell them from harmless kinds and 
also be able to tell the larvee or wigglers, in their breeding 
places. All of the mosquitoes ‘that are concerned in     spreading this disease belong to a single group and are 
closely related. The adults are rather long-legged as 
compared with other kinds; when at rest, they stand 
with their bodies pointing head first to the surface 
to which they are clinging (Fig. 172). Other mosquitoes
-P-A-G-E-277
INSECTS AND HEALTH 267 
rest with the body parallel to the surface upon which 
they touch, 
Among the larva, or wigglers, these positions are quite 
reversed, as the malarial kinds are usually found with their 
bodies just under the surface of the water and parallel to it, 
while the other kinds hang, head 
downward, nearly at right angles 
to the surface (Fig. 173). Green 
scum is usually present where 
malarial mosquitoes abound. 
The remedies. — These mos- 
quitoes do not fly far from the 
places where they breed. It is 
only necessary to thoroughly 
screen the houses, to avoid being 
bitten by the mosquitoes, and to 
fill or drain the places where they 
breed to stop completely the spread of this disease. Care 
  RIAL Mosquito ABOVE 
should be taken to empty the water at least once a week 
from drinking troughs, barrels, etc., where the mosquitoes 
might breed. Tin cans, or similar water holders, should 
be buried or placed so that they cannot hold water. Cis- 
terns and wells should be covered and everything possible 
done to prevent the multiplication of mosquitoes of any 
kind. The reward for such work will be a largely increased 
measure of comfort and health. 
NoTE TO THE TEACHER. — Bulletins on mosquitoes have been pub- 
lished especially by the United States Department of Agriculture and 
the state experiment stations at the following post offices: Berkeley, 
Cal.; Lexington, Ky.; College Park, Md.; Agricultural College Post 
Office, Miss., and New Brunswick, N. J.

  268 AGRICULTURE 
EXERCISE. — Catch some of the mosquito wigglers which you may 
find in standing water and keep them in a glass partly filled with water, 
under a lantern globe covered with cheese cloth. Watch the habits of 
the larve and pupa. If you can find any of the boat-shaped egg 
masses of the common house mosquito or the single eggs of the malarial 
mosquito, put them into a tumbler of water by themselves and watch 
them until they become full-grown mosquitoes.

SECTION XLIX. THE HONEYBEE 
Tue keeping of bees for the production of honey is an 
important industry in many sections of the country and is 
practiced to some extent nearly everywhere. The occur- 
rence of nectar in flowers and the visits 
of the bees and other insects to the flow- 
ers to secure it are well-known facts. Many 
wild bees store honey, but: the few kinds 
kept and cared for by man have developed py, 175, Worker 
a wonderful ability to do this. Bees are BEE 
provided with powerful stings which 
they are likely to use if anything 
threatens their home and honey sup- 
plies. But bees are not dangerous to 
one who knows how to handle them 
Drone BEE properly. 
The members of a colony. — The workers number from 
25,000 to 35,000 in a hive. These do all 
of the work of collecting and storing the 
honey and all of the housekeeping in the 
hive. Besides the workers there are a few 
male bees or drones, and usually only one 
queen (Figs. 175, 176, 177). If more than Fic. 177.— QuEEN 
one queen is present, there will be warfare BEE 
between the two until one is killed; or if the colony is 
strong and the honey supply abundant, part of the

  2609 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
  270 AGRICULTURE 
workers may leave the old hive with the new queen and 
found another colony. This is called swarming. 
The work of the queen. — The queen bee is very care- 
fully cared for by the workers, for upon her depends the 
very life of the colony. They feed her and do everything 
else possible for her comfort and safety. The reason for 
all of this anxiety about the queen is that she alone lays 
all of the many thousands of eggs for the colony. Her 
strength is saved for that work. 
The bee nursery. —The worker bees build the oney- 
comb in which the honey is stored and in which the young 
-bees are reared. Separate combs are used for these two 
purposes. While the honey is stored for food, the young 
bees are not fed upon it directly. They are not brought 
up in the cells with the honey. This is how it is possible 
to have the fine solid combs of pure honey. 
When a comb is prepared for the rearing of the young, 
the queen is taken to it by the workers. She places one 
egg in the bottom, or rather in the inner end, of each cell. 
With that her work is done. But during the summer 
time, she may have to lay several hundreds or even thou- 
sands of eggs every day. Whether the young bee is to 
become a worker, a drone, or a queen depends largely 
upon the kind of cell in which the egg is placed and also 
upon the kind of food that the young bee is fed. The 
workers are developed in the ordinary sized, horizontal 
cells. The drone cells are much larger, but also horizontal, 
and the eggs deposited in these are supposed to be in- 
fertile. The workers can produce a queen when they 
desire by forming a larger vertical cell, placing in it an
-P-A-G-E-281
THE HONEYBEE * 271 
ordinary worker egg, and then feeding the young larva 
upon a special kind of food which is called royal jelly. 
The bee larve are little legless creatures and are fed 
and cared for entirely by the workers. Their food is a 
mixture of honey with pollen. After they become adult 
they do not leave the hive for some days, but serve as 
nurses for the larvee stillin the cells. In about two weeks 
they also begin the collection of honey. 
How honey is made.— When collecting honey, a bee 
usually visits only one kind of flower on a trip. The 
sweet nectar is carried in a special stomach from which the 
bee is able to expel it again for storage in the honeycomb. 
Upon its legs and body the bee carries pollen from the 
flowers it has visited. Bees really gather nectar, not 
honey. After the nectar has been stored in the comb, 
the bees fan it with their wings and dry out much of the 
water, and in due time it ripens into real honey. 
There are so many things to be known in order to man- 
age bees successfully that it has become a special business 
to which many people give all of their time. Upon the 
amount of honey produced each year depends the value of 
a colony of bees. From well-managed hives of selected 
bees and during seasons favorable for the growth of the 
honey-producing plants as much as several hundred 
pounds of. honey may be stored by a single hive. 
Length of life of bees. — The life of a colony of bees 
may be continued indefinitely, but the life of the individ- 
ual workers is short in the summer time when they are 
flying a great deal. They wear their wings out and thus 
really work themselves to death, ina few weeks. The drones 
   
-P-A-G-E-282
  272° AGRICULTURE 
Ricvor live over winter and are usually killed by the workers 
during the fall. But the queen may live for several years. 
When a queen becomes old or exhausted, a new one takes 
her place and the life of the colony goes on steadily. 
Producing select hives of bees. — The best kinds of bees 
have been developed in Italy. Among these are the /tal- 
ian and the Carniolan bees. In some respects the latter 
are the best bees known., By placing a single fertile 
queen of one of these choice kinds. in a hive of common 
bees, it will happen that in a few weeks or months all of the 
bees in the hive will be of her kind because she lays all 
of the eggs. This is the way colonies of choice bees are 
produced. Such queens are raised for sale by some bee- 
keepers and can be sent long distances by mail. 
Honey-producing plants. — For the best results with bees 
it is important that there be an abundance of good honey- 
producing plants in the vicinity of the hives. Among the 
best plants for this are some of the clovers, alfalfa, vetches, 
and many of the common fruit trees. Sweet clover, which 
grows wild and which is also cultivated on lime soils in the 
Southern states, is an excellent bee plant. Many of the 
wild flowers and weeds are sources of abundant honey- 
supply. Cotton, cowpeas, and buckwheat are good. The 
magnolia, palmetto, tulip or yellow poplar, and sourwood 
are valuable sources of supply. Before undertaking bee- 
keeping on a large scale the surrounding plant life should 
be carefully studied. Desirable honey-producing crops may 
be grown to help out the natural sources of supply.
-P-A-G-E-283
SECTION..L. IMPROVEMENT OF LIVE-STOCK 
Tue principal animals that add to farmers’ profits are 
horses, mules, cattle, ‘sheep, and swine. All of these ani-- 
tals have been greatly changed by man in order that 
they may better serve his uses. The active, slender, long- 
legged wild hog has been changed into the round-bodied, 
short-legged Berkshire or Poland-China. The angular, 
long-horned wild cattle of earlier days have been trans- 
formed into immense masses of flesh. 
The changes that have occurred in domestic animals 
have been brought about chiefly by selection of the ones 
best suited to their owner’s main purpose. Improvement 
in the kind and amount of food has also helped to make 
these changes. ‘ 
Improving common or scrub live-stock.— A breed is a 
large group of animals that resemble each other and 
whose offspring inherit the same qualities. A pure-bred 
animal is one both of whose parents belong to the 
same breed. Scrubs or natives aré animals having no 
ancestors that belonged to any distinct breed. Grades 
are animals descended from both pure-bred and scrub 
ancestors. 
Fortunately for the farmer, the pure-bred parent has 
more influence than the scrub parent in determining the 
form, color, and useful qualities of the grade offspring. 
273
-P-A-G-E-284
  274" AGRICULTURE 
Hence, the best way to improve cattle or other live-stock 
.-Cheaply is to purchase pure-bred sires, or males, and to 
use cheaper females. Starting with a pure-bred sire and 
“scrub females the first generation are half-bloods. The 
second géneration (or the offspring of these half-blood 
females and of a pure-bred sire) are three quarters pure; 
the members of the fourth generation are seven eighths 
pure, or high grades. The process of improving inferior 
animals by the use ‘of pure-bred sires is called grading up. 
It is the cheapest way for most farmers to improve their 
herds. The cheaper females intended as a foundation for 
‘the herd ‘or flock ought to be selected from the best of 
“their kind. 
The high grades may be just as good for butter or beef. 
or other special use as are the pure-bred animals, but for 
purposes of increase they are less valuable. This is be. 
cause some of their offspring may resemble their scrub an. 
cestors. It is unwise, therefore, to use either a grade 
or a scrub sire. A cross-bred animal is one having one 
parent belonging: to one breed and the other parent to 
another. When the parents are thus widely unlike, the 
character of the offspring is uncertain. Such violent 
crosses are generally unwise. 
Advantages of raising live-stock.— There are advan- 
tages in raising some live-stock even on farms devoted 
chiefly to cotton, sugar cane, tobacco, or grain. Some of 
the main reasons why live-stock ought to be raised on 
most farms are:— 
(1) Because they make profitable use of much grass 
and other coarse food that would otherwise be wasted.
-P-A-G-E-285
IMPROVEMENT OF LIVE-STOCK 275 
(2) Because they enrich the farm directly, by convert- 
ing most of their food into fertilizing material. 
(3) Because they enrich the farm indirectly, by causing’ 
the farmer to grow more cowpeas, clover, and other soil- 
improving forage plants.

Scotland. Draft horses are immense animals, generally 
weighing from 1500 to 2000 pounds. Their legs are rather 
short, very strong, and placed wide apart. Their bodies are 
rounded; their backs are broad, showing great develop- 
ment of muscles. Their shoulders are rather upright in- 
stead of sloping. This upright position enables them to 
  Fic. 180.—A Drart HorsE; CLYDESDALE 
throw their weight and strength squarely against the collar. 
Their feet are large. In the Southern states where the 
mule is a favorite work animal on the farm, the draft horses 
are used much less on the farms than in the cities. 
   
-P-A-G-E-288

Percherons. —The Pérch’e ron breed originated in France. 
: It has become very popular in the United States. The 
colors that most frequently occur are black and all shades 
| of gray. The Percheron horse is a very heavy, compactly 
built animal, with short legs free from long hairs (Fig. 
  Fic. 181.—A Coaca Horse 
179). A good Percheron shows style in form and move- 
ment, and in the proudly arched neck. 
Clydesdales. — The Clydes’dale breed originated in Scot- 
land. The colors are bay, brown, chestnut, or black; often 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
  
HORSES 279 
there is white on the face and feet (Fig. 180). A fringe 
of long hair grows out behind the lower portion of each leg. 
Coach or carriage horses. — A coach horse is a large, 
stylish animal, lighter and more active than the draft horse, 
but larger than light riding and driving horses (Fig. 181). 
  Light driving and riding horses.— These are formed for 
speed and hence have slender bodies, sloping shoulders, 
and long legs with sloping pasterns. Thoroughbred is the 
name of a breed of horses that are very speedy at the 
running gait. Thoroughbreds have been useful in giving 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
280 AGRICULTURE 
speed, endurance, and other qualities to driving and riding 
horses descended from them. 
American trotters owe their speed largely to their 
thoroughbred or running ancestors. They are largely used 
as buggy horses. The colors are various. 
The American saddle horse is prized for its easy riding 
gaits. The best saddle horses are expected to have five 
gaits; namely, (1) walk, (2) trot, (3) canter, (4) rack (an- 
other name for single foot), and (5) either the running walk 
  or slow pace or fox trot. The saddle horse should be of 
medium size, graceful proportions, and should have stylish 
action and a good disposition (Fig. 182). 
Shetland ponies.— These very small ponies are useful 
for children to ride and drive. They are usually gentle and 
make delightful pets. The height is oftenest from 36 to 42 
inches (Fig. 183). Some ponies have been only 30 inches 
high. Most Shetland ponies are compact or “blocky ” in
-P-A-G-E-291
  HORSES 281 
form and stronger than their small size would suggest. 
Common colors are black, bay, and brown; grays, chest- 
nuts, roans, and spotted ponies are not unusual. 
Mules. — Mules are preferred to horses on Southern 
farms. They pull more steadily, are less high-spirited, and 
are put to work at an earlier age. Southern farmers can 
easily and profitably raise their own mules. 
Care of horses and mules. — Some of the most important 
points in the care of horses and mules,are these: — 
(1) An abundant but not excessive supply of food, con- 
taining an ample amount of nitrogen. 
(2) Clean, dry stables, so that the feet may not become 
diseased. 
(3) Frequent watering, best before meals. 
(4) Regular exercise. 
(5) Careful shoeing. 
EXERCISE. — Compare several horses with regard to the following 
points: slope of shoulders; slope of pasterns (the part of the leg just 
above the foot); size or fineness of the bones in the lower part of 
the leg.

SECTION LII. - BEEF CATTLE 
The beef type.— The chief use of the beef breeds is to fur- 
nish meat. The form that is desirable in a beef animal is 
one that affords the largest proportion of valuable meat and 
the smallest proportion of inferior meat and waste. Hence, 
the neck and legs should be short and the body full, d-ep, 
androunded. The shapeofa beef animal’s bodyis “blocky”

and somewhat like that of a brick set on edge with the 
edges and corners rounded off (Fig. 184). The best cuts 
are those from the upper part of the body, especially in the 
region of the loins. The back and loins of a beef animal, 
therefore, should be broad and deeply covered with flesh. 
282
-P-A-G-E-293
  BEEF CATTLE 283 
The hind quarters must be fleshy. Cows of the beef 
breeds usually give only enough milk for their calves. 
Most beef breeds that are popular in the United States 
originated in England and Scotland. A mature cew of the 
beef breeds often weighs 1500 pounds or more, or nearly 
twice the weight of a scrub or Jersey cow. The males 
sometimes weigh more than 2500 pounds. 
  
  Fic. 185.— A HErzForD 
Even grade animals of the beef breeds are better than 
scrubs because they grow larger, mature earlier, and afford 
a larger proportion of valuable meat. All these advantages 
can be obtained by the purchase of a pure-bred sire.

  BEEF CATTLE 285 
The Hereford breed. — These cattle are sometimes called 
“White Faces” (Fig.185 ). The face, breast, legs, under- 
portion, and part of the neck are white; most of the body 
is red. The Hereford is a very valuable and popular breed 
and has been found especially satisfactory for the Western 
ranges. : 
The Aberdeen-Angus breed.— Other popular names for 
this breed are Polled Angus and Black Polled. The color 
is black over the entire body. There are no horns; even 
among the half-blood Angus grades very few animals have 
horns. In size, the Angus is slightly below the Hereford 
and Shorthorn. It hasa very blocky, rounded body. The 
Galloway (Fig. 187) is another black, hornless breed. 
The Shorthorn breed. —The horns are short, and in the 
cow they are gracefully curved. The principal colors are 
(1) solid red, (2) red and white mixed, and (3) roan, that is, 
a mottling of red and white. The Shorthorns are widely 
distributed over the United States. They are most valu- 
able for beef, but in some families of Shorthorns the milk- 
producing quality has been maintained. 
The Red Polled breed. — These hornless red cattle stand 
between the beef breeds and the dairy breeds. Red Polled 
cattle are smaller and generally less “blocky” than the 
beef breeds mentioned above. Their bodies, however, are 
rounded and plump. The breed includes many excellent 
milkers, and also many animals of the beef type. 
EXERCISE. — At home or on the farms of neighbors select the most 
“blocky ” cow you can find. Compare every part of her body with that 
of some more angular animai ; aiso compare her shape with those shown 
in the pictures of the beef breeds. If especiaiiy interested in beet

cattle, write to the Agricultural College of your state for score-card or 
publication showing how to judge beef cattle. 
NoTE TO THE TEACHER. — Encourage pupils to describe specimens 
of any of these beef breeds that they have seen. If the class can inspec‘ 
some animal of the beef type, whether pure-bred, grade, or native, re- 
quire them to locate the parts of the body where the greatest amounts 
of valuable meat are found. Compare the shape of this animal with the 
shapes shown in the pictures of beef cattle.

SECTION LIII. .DAIRY CATTLE 
The dairy type of cattle.— The form of a good dairy 
cow should be almost the opposite to that of a good beef 
cow. She should have a thin back, wide, prominent, bony 
hips, and lean hind-quarters (Fig. 188). If there is much 
flesh on the back, loins, and hind-quarters of a dairy cow,

she has made wrong use of her food, which should have 
been changed into milk or butter. 
The barrel, or rear portion of the body, must be large, 
so that in it she may store away much food while convert- 
ing it into miJk and butter. Viewed from the side, her 
body should be deeper at the hind flank than at the fore 
flank, giving a wedge-shaped appearance. Viewed from 
above, the dairy cow should also be wedge shaped, having 
the narrow part at the withers on top of the shoulder 
blades and the wide part at the hips. 
287 
   
-P-A-G-E-298
  288 AGRICULTURE 
The udder should be large and should extend well for- 
ward. The loose skin forming its rear portion should 
extend as high as possible. The milk veins in front of 
the udder should be large and crooked, and the “milk 
well” where they enter the chest cavity should be large. 
    Fic. 189.— A Jersey Cow 
The milk veins carry blood from the udder where it has 
helped make milk. If they are large, it shows that much 
blood flows past the udder for use in making milk. 
The Jersey breed. — This breed originated on the little 
island of Jersey between England and France (Fig. 
189). The laws of that island do not permit any other 
breed to be introduced. The Jersey is now the most pop- 
ular dairy breed in the United States. This is because its 
milk is so rich. A Jersey cow often produces more than
-P-A-G-E-299
DAIRY CATTLE 289 
400 pounds of butter in a year, and some of them have 
records of more than twice that amount. 
The Jersey cow has a small, angular, lean body, a fine 
and beautiful head with short crumpled horns, and usually 
a rich, yellowish skin. Common colors among Jerseys 
  Fic. 1900,— A HotstEIn Cow 
are silver-gray and fawn color. White markings are 
frequent. The legs and nose are often black. : A Jersey 
or even a Jersey grade can generally be distinguished from 
most other cattle by the “mustache.” This is a ring of 
light-colored hair around the muzzle or nose. 
The Guernsey breed.— This breed is very similar to 
the Jersey, but the form is somewhat larger and coarser, 
and light colors are less common, Guernsey milk is quite 
as rich as Jersey. These two breeds are entitled to be 
called the two principal butter breeds. The Guernsey

black-and-white cattle, and give larger amounts of milk 
than any other breed. Some cows have given more than 
10 gallons of milk in one day. However, the milk is not 
rich. 
EXERCISE. — Select some good milch cow of the dairy type. Make 
a drawing of the outer line of her udder. Locate the parts of her body, 
using Fig. 191. 
NoTE TO THE TEACHER. — Doubtless a good dairy cow can be in- 
spected by teacher and class. If so, instruct pupils in locating parts 
of body and in noting their correspondence with the “ dairy shape,” as 
suggested in text and illustrations. This exercise will bear frequent 
repetition. Then compare, in all points, any two cows placed together.

SECTION LIV. SHEEP 
Lone before cotton was known, men and women wore 
garments made of wool. The sheep still furnishes a large 
part of our clothing. This animal is as useful for its flesh, 
called mutton, as for its wool. 
Sheep are more easily kept than almost any other ani-

will not touch. Thus they help to keep the farm clean 
and neat and improve the land on which they pasture 
This explains the true proverb that ‘‘The hoof of the sheep

-P-A-G-E-302
      292 AGRICULTURE 
is golden.” Every farm ought to have its flock of sheep. 
The wool generally pays the cost of keeping them. The 
lambs are clear profit, and usually a flock produces more 
lambs than there are ewes. A lamb will often sell when a 
few months old for as much or more than its mother. 
Unfortunately, sheep are subject to injury and death

from worms in the stomach and intestines. Change of 
pasture at brief intervals is the best means of avoiding 
these troubles. ; 
There are three types of sheep, fine-wool, medium- 
wool, and long-wool. The long-wool breeds, which are 
used both for mutton and wool, haye not been extensively 
raised in warm climates.
-P-A-G-E-303
  SHEEP 293 
Medium-wool breeds. — The medium-wool breeds include 
the Dorset, Shropshire, Southdown, and others. They 
afford good mutton and a fair amount of wool. 
The Dorset is a sheep of medium size. Both sexes have 
horns. Dorsets are prized for the early date at which 
their lambs come and for the frequent occurrence of twin 
lambs (Fig. 192). 
The Shropshire (Fig. 193) is of medium size or above. 
  Fic. 194.— A SourHDowN

The Southdown (Fig. 194) is a favorite mutton breed 
over almost the whole world. Its face, ears, and legs 
are of a brownish color, but of a lighter shade than 
those of the Shropshire. The Southdown is a little 
smaller than the Shropshire and affords somewhat less 
wool.

EXERCISE. — Write in your notebook the month in which shearing 
is done, asking older persons if you do not know. If any member of 
the class has seen sheep sheared by machinery, he should be prepared 
to tell how it was done. If there is a flock of sheep near you, watch 
them while grazing and notice the weeds that oy consume which 
other liye-stock would not eat.

  SECTION LV. SWINE 
It costs so little to make a start in improving the hogs 
on any farm that scrubs, or razorbacks, ought soon to 
disappear. Pure-bred hogs and grades mature at a much 
earlier age than scrubs and grow to a much larger size. 
Hogs are ini and much more profitable when they 
live partly on pasturage. But even with the best pastures 
of grass or clover, it pays to feed them some grain. In 
the Southern states, hogs can be raised on very little corn 
by growing artichokes, chufas, vetches, clovers, and alfalfa 
for them to eat in cool weather. When the weather be- 
comes warm, there should be ready for them fields of sor- 
ghum, cowpeas, peanuts, and soy beans, besides pastures. 
It costs less to put a pound of flesh on a young hog 
than on one more than a year old. It is generally more 
profitable, therefore, to make a pig grow large enough to 
be made into pork when ten to twelve months old than to 
feed it longer. 
Hog cholera and swine plague destroy great numbers 
of hogs every year. They are due to germs that have 
been brought from other places where the diseases have oc- . 
curred. They are carried by means of running water, by 
loose animals, by buzzards, and even by the shoes of men. 
These diseases can generally be prevented by not allowing 
the hogs to range outside of their pasture, and by keeping 
out of the hog pasture and lots everything that has been

-P-A-G-E-306

on a farm where these troubles have recently occurred. It 
is safest for hogs not to drink water from a stream that 
originates beyond one’s own property. 
Breeds of hogs.— There are many breeds of hogs. 
Among the most popular are the Berkshire, Poland-China, 
Duroc-Jersey, and Chester White. 
The Berkshire is a large or medium black hog with white

markings on the face, feet, and legs. The face is short 
and sharply dished. The ears are held stiff or rigid. 
The Poland-China is a large or medium black hog with 
slight white markings on the face and feet. The face is 
not sharply dished. The tips of the ears droop (Fig. 
196). 
The Duroc-Jersey is a large reddish hog with shape of 
face and ears like the Poland-China. There are many 
pigs in a litter. aa

The Chester White is a large white hog with drooping 
ears. White hogs are regarded as less hardy in the South 
than those of other colors. 
EXERCISE. — Compare a pure-bred or good grade hog with a razor- 
back, noting especially differences in nose, neck, back, and hams. 
NOTE TO THE TEACHER. — Write to the Agricultural College in 
your state for score-card for judging hogs. These sheets contain suffi- 
cient directions. It is instructive and interesting, after some practice in 
judging fairly good hogs, to have pupils engage in a judging contest.

  SECTION LVI. THE MANAGEMENT OF 
POULTRY 
Tue poultry products of the United States are esti- 
mated to be worth about five hundred million dollars each 
year. The hen has even a stronger claim than this on our 
care. In her eggs and in the flesh of her chickens she 
furnishes the most nutritious kind of human food. Fowls 
are still further useful on the farm because of the large 
numbers of injurious insects that they destroy. They also 
make profitable use of waste material, such as grass, sur- 
plus vegetables, bruised fruit, and spilled grain. Some 
kinds of fowls afford valuable feathers. 
Improving the flock.— By saving eggs from only the 
best layers for hatching there will be every year an increase 
in the number of eggs laid by the flock. Hens have been 
raised that produced more than two hundred eggs in a 
year (Fig. 198). This was done by selecting through 
several generations the best layers and the roosters hatched 
from eggs laid by the best hens. Those who cannot at 
once have pure-bred fowls should improve the flock " 
using only pure-bred cocks. 
Food for poultry.— Fowls lay best and grow best ees 
allowed some exercise. The insects that they catch 
while ranging in orchard or pasture or field form a most 
nutritious diet. When fowls are not permitted to range, 
298
-P-A-G-E-309
THE MANAGEMENT OF POULTRY 299 
the food given them must be rich in nitrogen. Foods 
suitable for supplying nitrogen to poultry are the seeds of 
cowpeas and soy beans, leaves of clover and of all legumes, 
  
  Fic. 198.—A Walter LecHorn HEN THAT LAID 216 EGGS 1N 
| TEN Montus 
meat scraps, | skimmed milk, and fresh, ground bones. 
These should be fed mixed with the usual daily supply of 
corn, wheat, or oats. 
Poultry thrives best when furnished with a variety of 
food and when constantly supplied with green food. A 
field of rape, alfalfa, or clover should be grown especially 
for poultry. When fowls are confined, green food ought 
to furnish en of the daily ration.
-P-A-G-E-310
  300 AGRICULTURE 
Grit. — Fowls prepare their food, not by chewing it like 
larger animals, but by grinding it against grit in the giz 
zard. Hence, fowls must have an abundance of grit, which 
may be sand, gravel, cinders, pounded glass or oyster 
shells, or any finely divided hard substance, If they range, 
fowls can pick up enough of this. If confined, they should 
be supplied with some form of grit, as clean sand or crushed 
oyster shells. The oyster shells are especially useful to 
laying hens because, besides serving in the gizzard to grind 
the food, they furnish lime. Much lime is needed to form 
the shell of the egg. 
Destroying vermin. — The profits from poultry are much 
reduced by the discomfort caused by lice and mites. When 
fowls can scratch and roll in the dust, the dust often suffo- 
cates the lice. A box of fine dry road-dust, or sifted ashes, 
should be kept in the poultry-house so that the fowls can 
regularly take their dust baths and thus destroy many 
vermin, Chicken mites are not all thus killed. Many 
leave the fowls after tormenting them all night, and spend 
the daytime on the roosts and walls of the poultry-house. 
Hence, the house ought to be whitewashed frequently with 
a lime wash to which crude carbolic acid has been added. 
' The orchard spray pump may be used and the walls 
and roosts sprayed either with this kind of whitewash 
or with kerosene emulsion. Directions for making this. 
mixture, so useful for killing insects, are. given in,,the 
Appendix. 
By having the nests movable, these can be brought out 
of the hen-house at frequent intervals and the straw burned, 
thus ridding them of vermin. Some poultrymen dip their

Water. — Chickens need a constant supply of clean water. 
A good way to keep it clean is to buy a water fountain in 
which they cannot make the water unclean. 
A home-made drinking fountain can be 
made as follows: with a nail make a hole 
in a can about half an inch from the open 
end. Fill the can full of water and over it 
place a pan about two inches deep. Quickly 
invert both. The water will stand in the pan Fic. 199. — A HomE- ‘e 5 .

er tole eee a __A good poultry-house should be venti- 
lated, but not crossed by draughts of air. 
Sunshine should be let in to keep it dry and to destroy 
germs of certain diseases. The roosts should be movable 
and smooth, so as not to afford hiding places for vermin. 
Some careful poultry-breeders build a platform under the 
roost and a foot or two below. This keeps the floor clean 
and saves all the manure, which is much richer than that 
from the larger farm animals. 
  EXERCISE.— Weigh a dozen eggs; write the weight in your notebook. 
Are they all of the same size? Of the same color? Try to think why 
eggs that have become greasy do not hatch well. 
NOTE TO THE TEACHER. — Encourage stateménts from pupils about 
familiar facts connected with the management of poultry, kinds of foods 
used, best location of nests for different fowls, etc. If any one can find 
an old can and pan, let him or her make a drinking fountain, and show in 
class how it operates. See whether any pupil would like to make one 
for use at home. Parents would appreciate one-

SECTION LVII. BREEDS AND VARIETIES OF 
CHICKENS 
Ir has been found easy to create new breeds of chickens 
by selection and by crossing. As a fesult, there are now 
more than one hundred varieties of chickens. These may 
be divided into four general classes, according to the use 
to which each is best suited. These classes are : — 
(1) The egg breeds. 
(2) The egg-and-meat breeds. 
(3) The meat breeds. 
(4) The fancy or ornamental breeds. 
The egg breeds. — The breeds of this class are so named 
because they lay more eggs than those of the other classes. 
The fowls are small and active. They are poor sitters. 
Among the leading egg breeds are the Leghorns, Minor- 
cas, Spanish, Red Caps, Andalusians, and the Hamburgs. 
They mature early, pullets beginning to lay before they 
are five months old. The eggs of this class are generally 
pure white. 
Most breeds of each class are again subdivided into vari- 
eties named according to color of plumage or shape of 
comb. In other respects, these varieties of each breed are 
alike. The Leghorns include eight varieties ; among them 
are the White, Brown, and Buff Leghorns. A Leghorn 
hen should lay between 150 and 200 eggs in a year (Fig.

of medium to large size. 
They are good layers,

Reds, and Orpingtons. There are three varieties or colors 
of Plymouth Rocks, Barred (Fig. 201), White, and Buff. 
Wyandottes are divided into eight varieties, including the 
White (Fig. 202) and the Silver-laced (Fig. 203). 
Meat breeds. — These include the largest fowls. The 
hens ‘lay fewer eggs than do the hens of either of the 
other classes. These fowls 
are gentle and good sitters. 
Their large size renders them 
less active and less able to 
search for food than the 
smaller breeds. Hence, they 
require more care and food. 
The principal meat breeds 
are the Brahma (Fig. 204), 
Cochin, and Langshan. Each 
is subdivided into varieties of 
different colors. The Light 
Brahma is the largest of all chickens. All three breeds 
have feathers on the leg or shank. ; Fic. 204.— Lint BRAHMA ROOSTER 
EXERCISE. — Write in your notebook the names of all the breeds of 
chickens you know. What is the color of each ? What is the color of 
the leg or shank? How many toes have chickens? Why are the feet 
of ducks and geese different from those of chickens and turkeys?

  SECTION LVIII. PRINCIPLES OF FEEDING 
ANIMALS 
Anmats cannot feed on the minerals in the soil nor 
on the carbon dioxid in the air. The plant lives upon 
both. The chief use of the plant to man is in chang- 
ing the minerals from the soil and the carbon dioxid from 
the air into substances fit to nourish man and his servants, 
the domestic animals. Plants form the natural food of the 
animals of the farm. 
The same classes of substances are found in the bodies 
of plants and animals. These are water, ash, and protein 
(that is, materials containing nitrogen). Each of these sub- 
stances in the plant goes to form somewhat similar matter 
in the animal body. But plants contain substances not 
found in the flesh of animals; these are starch and sugar. 
Yet starch and sugar are among the most important foods 
of animals. Instead of adding these to its own body un- 
changed, the animal converts starch and sugar into animal 
fat, or uses them as fuel. 
Ash. — This is the part, of the dry matter of plants or 
animals that will not burn. There is generally an abun- 
dance of ash in the common foods to supply all that animals 
need. But pigs fed on corn alone without any pasturage 
may be helped by giving them wood ashes, which aid in 
the formation of their Hones and in other ways. Fowls 
306
-P-A-G-E-317
  PRINCIPLES OF FEEDING ANIMALS 307 
too, when confined and fed on corn, need ash, in the form 
or ground bone and the like. 
Protein. — In plants and animals most substances con- 
taining nitrogen are called protein (pronounced prd’té in). 
Forms of protein are the white of eggs and the curd in 
soured milk. The protein of plants is used by the animal 
to make lean meat, muscles, blood, and curd in milk. Men 
or farm animals doing heavy work require an abundance 
of this substance. So do cows when giving much milk. 
Among the foods richest in protein are cotton-seed meal 
and both the hay and the seeds of leguminous plants. In- 
deed, seeds of all kinds contain a considerable proportion 
of protein. 
Fuel for heat and force.—The animal body is a ma- 
chine with much work to do. Even an idle horse expends 
some force or work in the circulation of the blood and 
the digestion of food. All the work the-horse has to do 
increases the force or energy he must expend. Hence, 
the horse needs to use a part of his food to produce force 
or motion just as much as a steam engine needs burning 
coal to furnish power. An animal needs some food to 
serve as fuel to keep the body warm. Thus a part of the 
food is consumed, or slowly “burned,” in the body in 
order to be changed into heat and force. Among the sub- 
stances that serve as fuel to produce heat and force are 
starch and sugar. Starch, sugar, and the coarse fiber of 
plants are called carbohydrates. This is because they 
consist of carbon and hydrogen, in addition to oxygen. 
Fattening. — An animal that digests more carbohydrates 
than it needs for heat and force changes the surplus into  
-P-A-G-E-318
  GRICULTURE 308 
   its body, or adds to its milk. No 
fattening can occur until after all food necessary to do 
the work of the animal’s body has first been provided. 
Fat. — Fat or oil is abundant in the seeds of some plants, 
as in cotton seed, flaxseed, soy beans, and peanuts. The 
fat of plants can be used by the animal to make fat in the fat, which it stores fa

animal body. Fat in the food is also used for fuel to 
produce heat and force. Indeed, one pound of fat when 
burned makes about two and one fourth times as much 
heat as one pound of carbohydrates. 
If it does not have enough protein, the animal will suffer, 
because nothing else can take the place of protein in 
making lean meat, muscles, blood, bone, eggs, wool, and 
curdin milk. However, if fats or carbohydrates are omitted
-P-A-G-E-319
  PRINCIPLES OF FEEDING ANIMALS 309 
entirely, the other substances can take their place. But 
the omission or insufficient supply of any of these is 
unwise and unprofitable. 
Animals differ in the use of food. —Ycung animals re- 
quire less food than older ones to increase their weights 
equally. It is much more profitable to fatten a hog less 
than a year old than one nearly two years old. 
Hogs and chickens require most of their food in con- 
densed or concentrated form. Ilorses need about half 
concentrated food and half bulky food, like hay. Cattle 
and sheep may do well on a ration that consists chiefly of 
bulky foods. 
Animals of the same breed differ greatly in the use 
they make of their food. One fattens on much less food 
than another does. Experience and study enable good 
judges of animals to select those that fatten most readily. 
EXERCISE. — Weigh an exact quart or gallon of corn, corn meal, 
wheat bran, cotton-seed meal, and any other common) “ grain feeds” 
that are convenient. Write the weights in your notebook and compare 
them with the weights that your classmates find. Ask your parents 
what'are the cheapest foods for feeding cows. 
NOTE TO THE TEACHER. — No portion of the tables following is to 
be memorized. - They are for reference in working problems suggested 
in the next section. In case the sixth grade studies this book, or in 
case the class is backward in arithmetic, the whole of the next section 
may be omitted. Do not, however, omit Section LVIII. If the class 
has studied an elementary book on physiology, require the pupils to 
read now those parts of it bearing on digestion and food. 
 
-P-A-G-E-320
SECTION LIX. CALCULATING RATIONS 
FOR LIVE-STOCK 
A RATION is a supply of food for an animal for one day. 
It is called a balanced ration when it contains just the 
proportion of digestible protein to the carbohydrates and 
fat that tests have shown to be best for that particular kind 
of animal. A balanced ration for most animals contains 
five or six times as much digestible carbohydrates and fat 
as digestible protein. The proportion between digestible 
protein and carbohydrates and fat is called the nutritive 
ratio. It is obtained by multiplying the fat by 2}, adding 
this product to the carbohydrates, and dividing the sum 
by the quantity of protein. 
The table on page 313 shows what amounts of each of 
these substances have been found best for different kinds 
of animals. The longer table on page 314 shows how 
many pounds of digestible substances there are in 100 
pounds of the most common foods. From these two tables 
can be calculated a ration that is best for a cow giving 
milk, for a work horse, or for other animals. 
Examine both tables to learn whether a ration for a 
horse at medium work could be made from corn and oat 
straw. The shorter table shows that a ration for a horse 
ought to contain about 6.2 times as many pounds of di- 
310
-P-A-G-E-321
  CALCULATING RATIONS FOR LIVE-STOCK 31t 
gestible carbohydrates and fat as of protein. The longer 
table shows that corn has 9.8 and oat straw 33.8 times 
as much carbohydrates and fat as protein. Evidently a 
mixture of corn and oat straw contains too. large a pro- 
portion of carbohydrates, which means that it contains 
too little protein. This protein can be supplied by using 
cowpea or clover hay in place of the straw. 
In feeding animals first be sure that enough protein 
and carbohydrates are supplied. It may be proper to 
give a slight excess of protein if this does not increase 
the cost. The more protein fed, the richer is the fer- 
tilizer. 
ExampLe. — Calculate a ration for a cow producing 22 pounds 
of milk per day, using grass hay, cotton-seed meal, and corn. The 
table on page 321 shows that a cow necds 2.5 pounds digestible 
protein, 13 pounds of carbohydrates, and .5 of a pound of fat. Start 
by guessing how much of each food might perhaps serve. Take 15 pounds 
of hay, 5 pounds of corn or corn meal, and 3 pounds of cotton-seed meal. 
By dividing the figures in the table on page 322 by 100 so as to find 
the weight of protein, fat, etc., in every pound of grass hay, cotton-seed 
meal, and corn respectively, the c2lculations in the first table can be 
made. (See page 312.) 
The ration is thus figured to be 15 pounds grass hay, 8 pounds corn 
meal, and 3 pounds cotton-seed meal. 
The calculated ration contains more than enough protein and fat, but 
lacks about one pound of carbohydrates. Its excess of fat, .31 of 
a pound (after being multiplied by 2}) makes up most of this de- 
ficiency. The calculated ration need not contain the evact amounts 
required in the standard rations in the short table. 
Exercise. — In preparing this lesson pupils should rule their note- 
books as in the next table; copy the example; understand how every 
figure is obtained; and perform the suggested multiplications. To 
work the optional problems, the notebook should be ruled in the same 
way as in the example wcrked.

NoTE TO THE TEACHER. — The following problems are optional, 
and, if assigned, they should be divided into several lessons. They 
are solved in the same way as the example just given, and may be 
supplemented by original problems requiring calculations of rations 
for any class of animals, using the foods most common in any locality. 
Rations consisting largely of cotton seed and cotton-seed meal cannot 
be made to approach very closely to the standards. They will contain 
an excess of protein and fat and not enough carbohydrates. But they 
are satisfactory in the South, where the extra protein is cheap. 
If it should be desired to increase the number of problems and to 
make them apply to larger or smaller animals, the proportions of pro- 
tein, fat, etc., would be unchanged, but the total amount of each food 
would be, for example, four fifths as much for an animal weighing 800 
pounds as for one weighing 1000 pounds. 
Helps in teaching feeding and in working such problems may be had 
from bulletins from your state experiment station, or from those of the

United States Department of Agriculture, especially from Farmers’ 
Bulletin No. 22. You may expect the figures in different books show- 
ing the composition of foods to vary slightly. 
Problem 1. How many pounds of corn will be required to supply 
enough carbohydrates for a fattening pig, weighing 200 pounds ? 
Problem 2. How much soy-bean seed should be added to the amount 
of corn just found to supply the deficiency in nitrogen. 
Problem 3. Calculate a ration of corn and cowpea seed for this pig. 
Problem 4. Calculate a ration for a horse at heavy work, using cow- 
pea hay and corn. 
Problem 5. What would the ration in Problem 4 cost at’local prices? 
Problem 6. Find in the table on page 322 allthe kinds of hay that 
could be substituted for cowpea hay, that is, all those having a nutritive 
ratio between 3 and 6. 
Problem 7. Calculate the composition of the following Southern ra- 
tion and compare it with standard for a cow giving milk: 6 pounds 
cotton seed, 5 pounds corn meal, 15 pounds cowpea hay. 
Problem 8. Calculate the composition and compare with the stan- 
dard a ration of 6 pounds cotton seed, 7 pounds wheat bran, 15 pounds 
mixed grass hay.

  SECTION LX. THE PRODUCTION AND CARE 
OF MILK 
Cows of the same breed differ greatly in the amount 
and richness of their milk. The most accurate way to 
decide which are the best among a number of cows is to 
weigh the milk at regular intervals, once or twice a month, 
and then to test its richness. By 
using a Babcock milk-tester (Fig. 205), 
it is possible to tell just how much fat 
or butter-making material there is in the 
milk of any cow. Dairymen who try 
this plan sometimes find that half the a 
cows in their herd are not paying for pic. 205,—A Smatr 
their food. By selling the inferior cows Bancock_ Mu-x-rrst- 
for beef and keeping only those that a Oa 
make a large yield of butter fat, a dairyman sometimes 
doubles his net profits. 
Milking time.-— Avoid exciting a cow at milking time. 
Fear and excitement check the formation and flow of 
milk. Be regular and milk at the same time every day. 
Feed at regular hours also. 
Keeping the milk pure. — Milk is formed from the blood 
which circulates through the udder in exceedingly small 
blood vessels. While forming in the udder, milk of a 
healthy cow contains no germs. But as soon as it is drawn, 
315 
   
-P-A-G-E-326
  316 AGRICULTURE 
germs fall into it. A dirty udder, a dusty stable, dirty 
hands, and poorly cleaned milk vessels are the most 
common means of adding unwelcome germs to milk. 
Before milking, the dust and loose hairs on and around 
the udder should be removed by wiping with a damp 
cloth. The stables must be kept clean and well littered 
‘so that the cow’s udder and body may not be soiled. To 
avoid getting dust and germs in the milk, it is better to 
feed hay or other dusty food after milking or else a long 
time before. 
The milk pails, strainers, and all other vessels must be 
kept clean by careful washing and the use of scalding 
water or steam after each milking. Be sure to clean 
thoroughly the seams and rough places in metal milk- 
vessels. These hiding places may be crowded with germs 
if any of the dried milk is allowed to adhere. Sunning 
helps to clean milk-vessels, for sunshine is a great enemy 
of germs. Neither milk nor empty milk-vessels should 
ever be left in a room where there is sickness. Germs of 
human diseases sometimes enter milk by this means or by 
the use of impure water used in washing the milk-vessels. 
If the milk pails have partially covered tops and are held 
in a slanting position, much of the germ-laden dust will be 
excluded (Fig. 206). 
Cooling. — Milk or cream should be cooled as soon as 
possible, for germs do not multiply so rapidly in a cold 
temperature as in a warmone. Ope means of quickly coal- 
ing milk or cream consists in putting it in tall slender cans 
and placing these in cold water. Because these cans are 
deep, this method is called the deep-setting system of
-P-A-G-E-327
      
  THE PRODUCTION AND CARE OF MILK S17, 
raising cream, The most common method in Southern 
homes where only one or two cows are kept is to pour 
the milk as soon as drawn into shallow pans. 
Note TO THE TEACHER. — Let pupils test with blue litmus paper 
samples of buttermilk and whole milk of various ages or kept 12 to 30 
hours at different temperatures. If any dairyman near you has a Bab- 
cock milk-tester, try to plan a trip with the class to see it in operation. 
Samples of first- and last-drawn milk, and of milk from several cows, 
can be prepared in advance for testing. If a very small amount of 
formalin or other disinfectant is added, the samples can be kept for a 
number of days. If there is any money for school equipment, consider 
the purchase of a Babcock milk-tester, costing $4.00 or more. Write 
the Agricultural College of your state, asking which pattern to buy and 
from whom to order. Farmers will be pleased to have pupils test their 
cows.

  SECTION LXI. MAKING BUTTER 
Tue fat in milk is in the form of very small, round par- 
ticles, called globules. Since fat is lighter than milk, the 
fat globules rise to the surface, forming the cream. They 
rise more completely if the milk is cooled promptly after 
milking. Hence, milk is generally promptly poured into 
shallow pans, or quickly cooled in deep cans placed in 
cold water. But any method of removing the fat globules 
that depends upon their rising to the surface leaves many 
of them entangled in the skimmed milk. 
When shallow pans are used, about one 
fourth of the fat may be lost in the skimmed 
milk. However, the cream separator (Fig. 
207 )removes nearly all of the fat. It does 
this by the rapid revolution of the metal 
bowl through which the milk is passing. 
The bowl revolves six thousand times or 
  more per minute.. The rapid motion throws 
Fic. 207 A Hanp the heavier part of milk to the outer 
Cream SEPARATOR edge of the bowl, from which it runs out 
as skimmed milk. The cream, being lighter, collects 
nearer the center of the bowl, and overflows. 
Ripening cream for churning. — While many kinds of 
germs are harmful to milk, there is one kind of germ 
which the dairyman needs in milk or cream intended for 
318
-P-A-G-E-329
MAKING BUTTER 319 
: making butter. This is the lactic germ, or the one that 
produces the ordinary souring of milk or cream. When 
numbers of these germs get into‘milk kept at a mild 
temperature, they change the sugar in it into a pleasant 
acid, called lactic acid. the flavor of which is found in 
buttermilk. This acid changes that part of the milk 
which contains nitrogen into the somewhat solid curd, 
and makes it easier for the churn to separate the fat. 
Cream is soured or ripened before it is churned. 
If the milk or cream is kept too cold before churning, 
other germs that can endure more cold increase more 
rapidly than the helpful lactic germs, thus giving an un- 
pleasant flavor to the butter and buttermilk. On the other 
hand, if the cream is kept very warm, souring occurs very 
quickly and the butter is soft and inferior. A good tem- 
perature at which to ripen or sour cream at home is 60 
to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. This is a little cooler than the 
air of a comfortably heated living room in winter. In 
some dairies, the cream is cooled to about 50 degrees. 
Since the lactic germs inultiply slowly in cold milk or 
cream, it may be necessary in cold weather to add an 
extra supply of these germs. The addition of a little 
well-flavored buttermilk from a previous churning is one 
way to hasten the ripening of milk or cream in cold 
weather. 
The flavor of butter is chiefly due to ihe kind of germs 
in the ripening cream. To make sure that every lot of 
butter shall have a good, uniform flavor, some dairymen 
add a prepared starter, containing the particular germs that 
will produce the desired flavor. | 
 
-P-A-G-E-330
320 AGRICULTURE 
Churning.—— A good temperature for the cream in the 
churn is about 60 degrees Fahrenheit if the cows are fresh 
in milk and are not fed on cotton seed or cotton-seed 
meal. If these foods are fed, raise the temperature within 
the churn to some point between 63 and 68 degrees. 
Much warmer cream can be churned, but the butter is 
then soft and mixed with the curd of the milk. Such 
butter sells for a very low price and soon becomes rancid. 
Moreover, if the cream is warm when churned, much of 
the fat is left in the buttermilk. A dairy thermometer 
costs little and often saves many an hour of work and 
many a pound of butter. 
Sometimes, when butter will not come, it is because the 
cream is not sour enough, or because the churn is too full. 
The best churns are those that revolve, and these should 
not be more than one-third or one-half full. Green feed 
for the cows makes the cream easier to churn and gives 
to the butter an attractive yellow color. Sometimes, when 
the butter comes but will not gather, churning can be 
hastened, but the buttermilk ruined, by adding a little salt. 
Handling the butter.—The churn should be stopped 
when the grains of butter are about as large as kernels of 
wheat. Then draw off most of the buttermilk and add 
cold water to harden the butter. Later, wash the grains of 
butter thoroughly in cold water. Add fine dairy salt while 
working it on the butter-worker. It is generally best to 
work it twice. When coloring is added, it should be 
placed in the churn iis churning begins. A uniform 
color, neat prints, and careful wrapping in special oiled 
paper greatly increase the selling price.

  Exercise. — Who has seen and can describe a cream separator? 
Obtain two small clean bottles of the same size and shape and fill both 
with milk as soon as it comes from the cow. Shake one of them about 
every half hour. Leave the other perfectly still. On which does the 
cream rise best? Another day fill one of the these same bottles with 
the milk first. drawn from the udder and the other with strippings. 
After the cream rises, try to estimate how much more cream there is in 
strippings. 
NoTE*ro THE TEACHER. — Ask the pupils to take the temperature of | 
the well or spring water at home and of the contents of the churn. Could 
acan of milk be kept advantageously in water of this temperature? 
Would such water chill and harden butter? Ask for experiences in 
churning when the butter would not come. What were the condi- 
tions? 
OPTIONAL PROBLEMS IN DAIrYING.— (1) In one year cow A gives 
4000 pounds of milk and cow B gives 5000 pounds; the Babcock test 
shows that A’s milk contains 4.5 per cent of butter fat and B’s milk 3.5 
per cent; how many pounds of butter fat are produced by each in a 
year ? 
(2) Assuming that one pound of butter fat is mixed with enough 
water, curd, and salt to make 1} pounds of butter, what is the number 
of pounds of butter produced annually by each cow? What is the 
value of the yearly butter product of each cow, with butter at 25 cents 
per pound? , 
(3) How many more pounds of butter fat would cow A produce in a 
year (see problem 1) if the cream from her milk were separated in a 
cream separator than if it were raised in shallow pans, assuming that 
there is left in the skim milk from the separator ¥'; of the fat in the 
whole milk and in the skimmed milk } of the fat that was present in 
the whole milk? 
(4) What would be the value of this increased production of butter 
fat in problem 3, at 25 cents per pound of butter, assuming that each 
pound of butter fat would make 1! pounds of butter ? 
(5) Use the answer to problem 4 to determine how many months or 
years it would require for the extra amount or butter made by the sepa- 
rator from a herd of 6 cows like A to pay for a small hand-power 
separator costing $75. Can any one point out an additional saving (in 
feecing the calves) when a separator is used ?

SECTION LXII. FARM IMPLEMENTS AND 
MACHINERY 
MacuINERY now does much of the work on the farm 
once performed by human hands. Especially in grain 
growing the work has been lightened and the cost of 
production greatly decreased. 
Machinery for the grain-grower.— The seeds and fer- 
tilizers are sown with a grain drill. The self-binder cuts 
and binds as much ina day as many men with cradles could 
have done fifty years ago. While the grain cradle is still 
used on farms where only a few acres of grain are grown, 
or where the fields are too rolling for the use of labor- 
saving machinery, yet the cost of producing grain by this 
system is greatly increased. 
On some of the extensive grain fields of the West even 
a self-binder is displaced, and its work is done by still 
more powerful and effective machinery. The gvain 
header, drawn by steam or many horses, cuts the heads 
from many acres in a day, and as it moves along threshes 
and sacks the cut grain. 
Haymaking machinery.—In hay growing also inven- 
tion has made the labor much less burdensome than it 
was in earlier years. There are horse-rakes for collecting 
the hay into windrows, ‘edders for lifting and more rapidly 
drying it, and sweep rakes (Fig. 208), drawn or pushed by 
322
-P-A-G-E-333
  FARM IMPLEMENTS AND MACHINERY 323 
horses, for collecting hay from the windrows and carrying 
it short distances to the barn or stack. These sweep rakes 
save the work of loading a wagon. Where the distance is 
greater, so that hauling on wagons becomes necessary, 
  
  
  Fic, 208 .— MAcHINERY FoR HanpLinc Hay 
Sweep rake and stacker. 
there are hay loaders which save pitching the hay. 
These are hitched behind the wagon, and as the wagon 
and loader are drawn along, the hay is elevated from the 
windrow to the wagon. 
At the barn or stack one or two horses, hitched to a 
hay carrier, may lift the hay from the wagon to its place in 
the barn. Where sweep rakes are used to bring the hay 
to the stack, these deliver their burdens to a hay stacker 
(Fig. 208). Then the stacker, by means of horse power, 
raises the load to its position on the stack. Thus no 
lifting by human force need be done until the hay is on 
the stack. 2 
Machinery for corn, sugar cane, and rice.— The corn

grower, too, has profited by the mechanic’s art. He uses 
corn harvesters to cut and to tie his corn, shredders to sepa- 
rate the ears from the stalks, to remove the shucks, and to 
tear the forage into bits suitable for most convenient use 
  
  Ic. 209. —CorN HARVESTER, WITH BUNDLE-CARRIER ATTACHMENT 
as food or bedding. Even a bundle-carrying corn har- 
vester, or shocking machine (Fig. 209), and a machine for 
pulling the ears, have been invented. 
The rice-grower uses the grain-drill, the self-binder, and 
other machinery like that used in grain-farming. The 
sugar-planter is testing cane loaders, and cane harvesters 
are engaging the inventor’s attention. 
Labor-saving implements on cotton farms.—The cotton
-P-A-G-E-335
FARM IMPLEMENTS AND MACHINERY 325 
farmer has made less general use of labor-saving machin. 
ery than the grain and hay-grower. It is possible to grow 
cotton profitably with a few very inexpensive implements, 
and hence a beginning may be made in cotton culture by 
one who has very little capital. But here, too, it pays to 
utilize labor-saving machinery and the implements which 
make possible the most thorough preparation and cultiva- 
  tion. Most cotton farms on which several horses or mules 
are worked need a disk plow, large “turning plows,” a 
spike-tooth harrow (and often others), a weeder, and the 
best cultivators. Riding on one of these labor-saving 
implements, one intelligent man often does well the work 
that two or more men would ‘do while walking behind 
smaller implements. 
The invention of the cotton gin was the yreatest factor 
in building up the cotton industry of the South. Likewise 
a great cheapening of the cost of producing cotton will  
-P-A-G-E-336
    326 _ AGRICULTURE 
result when a cheap, simple, and durable cotton-picker 
shall be on the market. Recent successful public tests 
of at least two very different cotton-pickers point to the 
day of cotton-picking by machinery. 
Farm buildings. —- Not only are implements needed in 
farming, but also convenient farm buildings for sheltering 
implements, live-stock, and crops. A building too often 
absent from a cotton farm is a shed under which to store 
bales of cotton. If cotton is left exposed in winter, as in 
Fig. 215, there is a considerable loss in the quality and price 
of the lint, i 
EXERCISE. — Write in your notebook a list of the kinds of plows you 
have seen. How many kinds of harrows have you seen? Ask your 
parents to tell you some of the farm implements that they consider 
most useful. Write this list in your notebook and also what each is 
used for. What farm or household work needs some new inventions 
to make it lighter? 
Notre TO THE TEACHER. — Pictures of farm implements shown 
curing the recitation will interest the class. By writing a postal to 
some hardware companies or to manufacturers of farm implements, you 
~~ill often find them willing to send free catalogues containing pictures 
of farm machinery. Addresses of manufacturers can be obtained from 
the advertising columns of almost any agricultural paper, an old copy 
of which some pupil can probably bring you from home.

  SECTION: LXITI. EARTH ROADS 
Goop roads make country life more attractive. They also 
make possible in the country good schools, churches, and 
social gatherings. They soon pay for their cost in the 
labor of men and teams saved by hauling with a few loads 
over good roads the same weight that requires many loads 
over bad roads. Good roads pay, too, because they save 
wear and tear on teams and vehicles. Improving a road 
increases the value of the land near it. 
Location of roads. — A road is no better than its worst 
part. The load hauled is as large as the team can pull up 
the steepest hill or most boggy part of the road. Hence, 
the first work in improving a road ought to be to improve 
the worst places. It pays to change the location of a road 
to avoid the worst hills. Roads ought not to go straight 
up steep hills, but should curve around their sides. 
The best roads are made of a thick layer of broken stone 
or gravel. Stone roads cost several thousand dollars for 
each mile, and an engineer is needed to plan or build them. 
At slight expense earth roads can be much improved by 
proper grading, rounding, and draining. 
Avoid a steep rise or grade.— A road ought to be as 
nearly level as possible. The grade or slope of an earth 
road ought not to be more than six feet rise in each hun- 
dred feet of length, though steeper grades are sometimes 
necessary. The load that one horse can pull on a level 
327 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
  
ae 328 AGRICULTURE 
requires four horses to pull up a grade with a rise of ten 
feet in each hundred feet. 
Keep the center highest. — The center of a road should 
be arched so as to be at least five to eight inches above 
the sides. Whenever ruts or depressions remain long un- 
filled, mud-holes or washes occur. 
    Made from a 10°tol2" 19g. 
Fic. 211.—A Sprit-Loc Roap Drac 
A cheap road drag.— Ruts should be filled as soon as 
formed. This can be done by running a split-log drag 
along one side of the road and back on the other side. 
The drag shown (Fig. 211) is made from a split log and 
costs very little. 
A little work in filling ruts as soon as they form is 
worth much more than the same amount of work after the 
tuts have caused washes in the road. The best way to 
keep earth roads good is not by having many men to work 
them once or twice a year, but by having a few men, with 
team and split-log drag, ready to fill the ruts as soon as 
they form. This use of the drag arches the center, fills 
ruts and low places, and hastens drying. There should be 
a ditch on each side to carry off the water and to keep the 
toad-bed dry.
-P-A-G-E-339
  EARTH ROADS 329 
Sand-clay roads. — Deep sand-beds make the roads bad 
in many parts of the South. Some counties have changed 
these sand-beds into good firm roads by hauling clay and 
thoroughly mixing it with the upper six inches of sand. 
The clay and sand are mixed while wet by means of plows 
and harrows, or by the wheels of vehicles. Then the road 
is kept constantly rounded, so that water dees not stana 
on it. 
EXERCISE.— Are sandy roads best when dry or wet? Are clay 
roads best when dry or wet? Watch the teams struggle up some steep 
hill'and then consider whether the road could easily be changed: to 
ayeid that hill or to climb it more gradualiy.

II. SOME FERTILIZER FORMULAS 
As pointed out in the text, the only positive means of finding the 
best fertilizer. for a certain crop on a given soil is by making a field 
test of fertilizers. Until such a test is made, the following formulas may 
be used as suggestive and general, rather than as suiting every soil. 
Many other formulas having the same composition can be calculated 
as directed in Section XVIII. Acid phosphate is assumed below to 
contain 14 per cent of available phosphoric acid.

III. TO DESTROY INSECTS 
1. BISULFID OF CARBON 
For weevils and other insects in corn, cowpeas, or other grain or seed stored in 
tight cribs or bins. 
About one teaspoonful of liquid to each one or two cubic feet of 
space; pour the liquid into an open shallow can placed on tcp of the 
grain; cover the grain with cloth. ‘Phe liquid evaporates and the heavy 
fumes settle downward. The fumes are very inflammable ; hence, keep 
all lights and all smokers away until the odor has disappeared. 
2. PARIS GREEN 
For biting insects, including the potato beetle, and other insects Satna the 
leaves of field crops, vegetables, or fruits. 
Dust on as a ary powder Spray with 
Paris green, 1 pound. Paris green, } pound. 
Slacked lime or flour, 10 to 40 pounds. Lime, } pound. 
Water, about 50 gallons. 
3. KEROSENE EMULSION 
For soft-bodied, sucking insects, as scale, plant-lice, etc. | 
Hard soap (in fine shavings), } pound. 
Kerosene, 2 gallons. 
Water (soft or rain water), 1 gallon. 
Dissolve the shavings of soap in the water while it boils. Remove 
the water from the fire; add the kerosene, and churn the mixture by 
pumping it through a spraying pump until a creamy liquid, without free 
oil, is formed. This mixture contains 66 per cent of kerosene. Dilute 
it with from 6 to 1o gallons of water for scale insects, and with 10 to 
20 gallons for softer insects. 
4. LIME-SULFUR WASH 
For scale insects, applied while there are no leaves on the trees, 
15 pounds flowers of sulfur. 
20 pounds of unslaked lime. 
50 gallons of water. 
(15 pounds of salt is sometimes added.) 
Mix the sulfur with a very small amount ot water. Slack the lime in 
5 to 10 gallons of hot water; add the sulfur; dilute to 25 gallons; boil
-P-A-G-E-344
  ‘iv AGRICULTURE 
for 45 minutes. Then dilute with hot water to 50 gallons and apply 
it while hot. 
1V¥. TO PREVENT OR DECREASE DISEASES OF PLANTS 
1. BORDEAUX MIXTURE 
Bluestone (copper sulfate), 5 pounds. 
Best unslacked lime, about 5 pounds. 
Water, 50 gallons. 
Slack the lime with enough water to make a creamy wash. Add the 
lime and the bluestone to separate lots of, water. Dilute each as much 
as convenient before pouring the two liquids together. Strain through 
a coarse cloth before using. Consult your experiment station regarding 
further details about mixing and testing Bordeaux mixture, etc. When 
applied to the foliage of peaches, plums, or cherries, double the amount 
of water mentioned above. 
Apply Bordeaux mixture in a fine spray. It is used to prevent or 
decrease molds and most fungi attacking fruit trees and vegetables. 
Paris green can be added just before using the mixture, } pound of Paris 
green to 50 gallons, thus destroying both fungi and leaf-eating insects 
at the same time. 
2. FORMALIN 
To prevent oat smut, concealed smut of wheat, scab and other diseases of Irish 
potatoes, 
For wheat or oats, pour one ounce of formalin into three gallons of 
water. Dip or thoroughly moisten’ the seed-grain, and leave it moist 
and covered for two hours. Then dry the grain, and sow it before it 
comes in contact with more smut germs. 
To prevent scab, soak the seed-potatoes for two hours in a solution 
of 1 ounce of formalin in 2 gallons of water. 
V. TO*MEASURE GRAIN APPROXIMATELY 
Multiply the average depth by the average width, and the product 
by the average length of the pile, crib, or bin. To get the number 
of bushels of shelled grain, divide this figure (number of cubic feet) by 
14; to find the number of “bushels” of shucked ear corn, divide by 
2}; to find the number of “bushels” of unshucked ear corn, divide 
by 4.

VI SCHOOL GARDENS 
Below are given simple plans for planting inexpensively the individ- 
ual plot or bed assigned to each pupil. A length of 12 feet and a width 
of 5 feet are convenient dimensions to accommodate 6 rows across each 
bed. Select and modify as convenient that one of the suggested plans 
that most nearly corresponds to the time when the planting can be done 
most conveniently. The plan for planting in the fall, and the one for 
planting in April or May, can be conducted on the same bed. 
It is better to have two or more plans or sets of seed, so as to give 
each pupil some choice, and so as to increase the variety of plants under 
observation. In addition to small, individual beds, there should be rows 
or plots of the common field-crops of the locality, which require more 
room than can well be spared for them in the individual beds. These 
rows or plots should be considered the property of the whole school, 
and observed, cultivated, and protected by all.

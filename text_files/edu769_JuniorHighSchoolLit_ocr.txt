PREFACE _ The Junior - High School offers exceptional opportunity for re- 
lating literature to lifé. In addition to the aesthetic and ethical 
purposes, long recognized in the study of literature, the World 
War emphasized the need for an extension of aims to include the 
teaching of certain fundamental American ideals. To marshal the 
available material, setting it to work in the service of social and 
civic ideals, is to give to literature the “central place in a new 
humanism.” When we organize reading in the schools with ref- 
erence to the teaching of ideals—personal, social, national, and 
patriotic—we “put the stress on literature as one of the chief 
means through which the child enters on his intellectual and spiri- 
tual inheritance.” Outstanding among these ideals are: freedom,- 
love of home and country, service, loyalty, courage, thrift, humane 
treatment of animals, a sense of humor, love of Nature, and an 
appreciation of the dignity of honest work. In a word, to pro- 
vide a course in the history and development of civilization, 
particularly stressing America’s part in it, is the present-day 
, demand on the school. 
‘The Junior High School Literature Series, of which the present. 
volume is intended for use in the first year, provides such a 
course. The literature brought together in this book is or- 
ganized with reference to the social ideal. Nature in its varied 
relations to. human life, particularly child life, is presented in 
stories and poems of animals, birds, flowers, trees, and winter, all 
abounding in beauty and charm. Interest in Nature leads to in- 
| terest in the deeds of men filled with the spirit of adventure. The 
heroism of brave men and women from the age of chivalry to 
» the days of self-sacrifice on Flanders Fields is told in ballad 
and romance, thus stimulating qualities of courage, loyalty, and 
» devotion. Akin to these are the deeds of men who won freedom 
, for their fellows and gave meaning to the words, “our inheritance 
. of freedom.” Their heroism is told in story and song, from the 
: time of the Great Charter and Robert the Bruce to:the Declara-

  tion of Independence and the recent treaty of Versailles. The 
whole culminates in the literature and life in the homeland, in- 
terpreting America’s part in thes. ~.: + enterprises of the human 
spirit. Through legend and history the spirit and thoughts of 
our developing nation are portrayed in a literature of compelling 
interest, distinctively American. 
This book supplies material in such generous quantity as to 
provide in one volume a complete one-year course of literature. 
There is material suited to all the purposes that a collection of 
literature for this grade should supply: reading for the story ele- 
ment, silent reading, reading for expression, intensive reading, 
memorizing, dramatization, public reading and recitation, plot 
study, ete. Moreover, the book offers a wide variety of literature, 
representing various types: ballads, lyrics, short stories, tales, 
biographies, and the rest. The selections comprise not only those 
-that have stood the test of time, but also some of the choicest} 
treasures of the modern creative period. They are given in com- 
plete units; not mere excerpts or garbled “cross-sections.” 
The helps to study are more than mere notes; they take into 
account the larger purposes of the literature. Especially illuminat- 
ing are the selection “The Three Joys of Reading,” pages 9-14, 
and the Introductions to Parts II, III, and IV; these should bel 
read by pupils before beginning the study of the selections in the 
several groups, for they interpret and give greater significance t

aie THE THREE JOYS OF READING 
The picture on this page is called “A Reading from Homer.” 
Study each of the people who form the group. Judging from their 
dress and appearance, do you think they are people of the present 
time or of the ancient world? From what sort of book is the poet 
reading? Should you think such “books” could be owned by all 
  sorts of people, or only by a few? Study the reader’s expression. 
What sort. of story do you think he is reading? Can you decide 
anything about the listeners, who they are and what they are 
thinking about? Who is most deeply interested in the story, and 
why? 
Men do brave deeds on the sea, in far-off lands, or in war, and 
these deeds are the subject of song and story. Youths who are 
locking forward to heroic careers, and men and women to whom 
life has brought few thrilling experiences,.like to hear these tales. 
A well-told story opens the door to a new pleasure in living. An 
animal knows only the present. He is hungry, or tired, or his. 
life is in danger, or he is well fed and sleepy. But boys and girls,

and grown-ups, too, have not only their daily experience to drawt 
upon, but through books and magazines and papers they can) 
enter into the experience of others, so that they may live many F 
lives in one. 
Aladdin had a wonderful lamp. By rubbing it he cor 
anywhere he chose or could possess anything he desired. 
a lamp the reader of good books possesses. You come it: 
work or play, curl yourself up in a big chair before the fire, open! 
your book, and in a twinkling you are whisked away to a new, 
world. Your body is there, curled up before the fire, but enchant- | 
ment has come upon you. In imagination you are with Sindbad } 
the Sailor, or with Robinson Crusoe, or with King Arthur, or you 
are in the Indian Jungle, or on a ship sailing the South Seas, or 
you are hunting for Treasure Island. And you have it in your 
power to take these wonderful trips instantly; no railway tickets 
are required, no long delays. You may go on a journey to the 
other side of the world or into the South Polar ice or out on a 
western ranch. What is more wonderful, you may go back a 
century, or ten centuries; through this Aladdin’s lamp of. reading 
you are master not only of space, but also of time. Thus the first 
joy of reading is the privilege of taking part in the experiences of 
men of every time and every portion of the world. You multiply 
your life, and the product is richness and joy. 
The second joy of reading is even greater. Not only the world 
of adventure is open to you by means of books, but also a life 
enriched by the wisdom that has been gathered from a thousand 
poets and historians as bees gather honey from a thousand flowers. 
There is a story of a great Italian of the sixteenth century who 
found himself in the prime of life without a position, without 
money, and even compelled to become an exile because of a revolu- 
tion. He retired to a farm remote from all the scenes in which 
his previous life had been passed. All day he worked hard, for 
only by hard work could he live. But in the evenings, when work 
was done, when horses and oxen and the laborers who had toiled 
with them all the day had gone to sleep, this man put on the splen- 
did court dress he had worn in the days of his prosperity, days 
when he had associated with princes and the great ones of the
-P-A-G-E-12
  The Three Joys of Reading xi 
earth, and so garbed he went into his library and shut the door. 
And then, he tells us, for four hours he lived amid the scenes that 
his books called up before him. He found in books an Aladdin’s 
lamp that transported him to past times, that revealed the secrets 
of nature, that showed him what 
men had accomplished. Through 
history, he re-created the. past. 
He could call on the wisest of men 
for counsel, and he forgot during 
these hours his weariness and pain. 
This story of the great Italian 
has been paralleled many times. 
There was once a boy in a fron- 
tier cabin who had no such expe- 
rience as this man passed through 
centuries ago, but who was eager 
to know all that could be learned 
about life. His days were long 
and hard, but he was dreaming of 
things to come. At night by the 
light of the pine logs blazing in the 
fireplace, this boy read and THE SONG OF THE LARK 
studied. Books were hard to get; sometimes he tramped for miles 
to borrow one that he had heard a distant farmer possessed. 
Thus Lincoln found the second of the joys of reading, the stored-up 
wisdom of the race that he appropriated against the day when 
he was to be not merely a student of history but a maker of 
history as well. 
Fhe third joy of reading is that through books our eyes are 
opened to the beauty of the world in which we live. There is 
a famous painting called “The Song of the Lark.” A peasant 
girl is on her way to work in the fields, sickle in hand, in early 
morning. . She has stopped to listen to the flood of melody that 
pours from the sky above her, and is trying in vain to see the 
bird which is singing the glorious song. Her dull, unexpressive 
face is lighted up for the moment in the presence of a beauty 
that she feels but does not comprehend. So the painter interprets   
    
    
  
 
-P-A-G-E-13
  xii Junior High School Literature, Book One 
  
for us the effect of beauty upon even a dull intelligence. But 
the poet translates the song into beautiful language, and we 
read and are happy. 
Thousands of people pass unthinkingly by a field filled with the 
common daisies. They know the name of the flower; they may 
even say, or think, that the flowers make a pretty sight. Buta 
poor young poct plows one up on his farm and tells us of his 
sympathy for the little flower he has destroyed; tells us, too, how 
the fate of the daisy suggests to him his own fate, so that all who 
read the poem by Robert Burns no longer see in the daisy a com- 
mon flower, but see instead a symbol of beauty. 
Bird-song and flower, the west wind as it drives the dead leaves 
before it or hurries the clouds across the sky or piles up in great 
masses the waters of the sea; the mountain that rises stark + ~° 
stern above the plain, the ocean over which men’s ships pas: 
things the poet helps us to see and to feel. So once more our 
Aladdin’s lamp brings us into scenes of enchantment, multiplies 
our lives, opens our eyes to things that the fairy-folk know right 
well, but which are forbidden to mortal eye and ear until the spell 
has worked its will. 
These, then, are the three joys of reading: First, to be able to 
travel at will in any country and in any period of time and to 
taste the salt of adventure; to hear the great stories " 
human race has garnered through centuries of living; 
earth’s heroes and to become a part of the company t 
rounds them. Second, to enter into the inheritance of wis: 
has come down from ancient times or that animates those 
the builders of our present world. “Histories make mc 
said one of the wisest of men, by which he meant tha: 
records the experience of men in their attempts to make t 
a place where people may dwell together in safety, and the... wu. 
reflect on this experience they become wiser. And poets and - 
writers, too, have told in books what they have thought to k 
meaning of life. They are like the wise old hermits, dwelli 
little cabins by the edge of the enchanted-forest, who tol 
Galahad or Sir Gawain or Sir Lancelot about the perils of th

est and how to win their way to the enchanted castle where dwelt 
the Queen. 
And the third joy of reading is that which brings us knowledge 
of this enchanted world. For it is a world of wonder in which we 
live as truly as that fairy world which so delighted you when 
Mother told you stories or when you read your fairy books. The 
journey of Captain Scott in search of the South Pole was as thrill- 
ing as the voyage of Sinbad. Those brave men who made the first 
flight in an airplane across the ocean the other day were as 
venturesome as Columbus, and their journey was as wonderful as 
that journey in 1492. But Captain Scott did not leave his com- 
fortable and safe life at home merely to seek adventure. It was 
an-expedition planned in order that he might bring back exact 
information about parts of the earth where men had never been 
before. And the flight across the Atlantic was just one more step 
in the development of a new form of transportation. So science 
contributes in many ways to our happiness and safety. What 
men do to develop the resources of the earth, what they do to 
conquer disease, the inventions and discoveries that give us 
greater power than if we possessed the open sesame of our fairy 
stories—these also you learn about in your reading. 
The book to which you are here introduced is planned in such 
a way as to help you find these three joys of reading. It is a 
big generous book, filled with good things. It is an Aladdin’s 
lamp.. Take it to your favorite big chair or to your favorite 
corner and test it. Do you wish to get into the Enchanted Forest? 
The very first selections, about animals and birds and growing 
things, take you there where you will find friends old and new. 
Do you wish to go on a long journey back to King Arthur’s time 
and meet the knights of the Round Table? The power is yours 
for the asking. Or if you prefer songs and stories of the sea, here 
is a-ballad that has been sung for centuries, or you may have 
ballads about battles in the war that ended the other day. And 
no-one knew the secrets of the Enchanted Forest better than — 
William Shakespeare—here are two stories that he loved. 
At some other time your book will take you back to the days 
of Wallace and Bruce, or will bring before you some of the things 
   
-P-A-G-E-15

England has done for Freedom, or will show you what Americans 
of the old time did and thought when they were building their free 
land for you to dwell in and to protect. And, last of all, there are 
stories of life in our America—old legends and stories that will 
make you smile, and stories of workers and their work. When 
you have finished the last section you will be happier and a better 
citizen, ready to do your share every chance you get. 
One word more. You know that, in order to work enchantment, 
people have had to do certain things. There was the fern-seed, 
you know, or the charm like “open sesame,” or you have to rub the 
wonderful lamp. Now to use this book rightly, you must not 
think of it as a lesson book, containing tasks. If you do that, it 
will be no Aladdin’s lamp at all but just a dull old smoky lamp 
that would not even guide you to the cellar. You must do these 
things: First, get that chair or that corner and make yoursel! 
comfortable. Second, look at the program. What is that? 
Why, the “Table of Contents,” of course. You must know where 
you are going and what you are to see. In this book everything 
is arranged in such a way as to help the charm to work. Third, 
you will find little questions and studies every now and then, and 
a glossary, guide-posts so that you will not lose your way. And, 
last of ‘all, you are to try to see the book as a whole and not as a 
sort of scrapbook about all sorts of things. For it all deals, in 
one way or another, with the Enchanted Forest and the Castle of 
Life.

hills. The vast plain waved with tall rank grass that swept our 
horses’ bellies; it swayed to and fro in billows with the light 
breeze, and far and near, antelope and wolves were moving, through 
it, the hairy backs of the latter alternately appearing and dis- 
appearing as they bounded awkwardly along; while the antelope, 
with the simple curiosity peculiar to them, would often approach 
us closely, their little horns and white throats just visible above 
the grass tops as they gazed eagerly at us with their round, black 
eyes. 
I dismounted, and amused myself with firing at the wolves.

  hill, a long procession of buffalo were walking, in Indian file, with 
the utmost grayity and deliberation; then more appeared, clam- 
_ bering from a hollow not far off, and ascending, one behind the 
_ other, the grassy slope of another hill; then a shaggy head and a 
pair of short, broken horns appeared, issuing out of a ravine close _ 
at hand, and with a slow, stately step, one by one; the enormous 
brutes came into view, taking their way across the valley, wholly 
unconscious of an enemy. In a moment Henry was worming his 
way, lying flat on the ground, through grass and prickly-pears, ‘ 
6 toward his unsuspecting victims. He had with him both my 
tifle and his own. He was soon out of sight, and still the buffalo 
kept issuing into the valley. For a long time all was silent; I 
sat holding his horse, and wondering what he was about, when 
suddenly, in rapid succession, came the sharp reports of the two 
ts rifles, and the whole line of buffalo, quickening their pace into a 
clumsy trot, gradually disappeared over the ridge of the hill. 
Henry rose to his feet, and stood looking after them. 
“You have missed them,” said I. 
“Yes,” said Henry; “let us go.” He descended into the ravine, 
\ded the rifles, and mounted his horse. 
We rode up the hill after the buffalo. The herd was out of 
‘hht-when we reached the top, but lying on the grass not far off 
8 one quite lifeless, and another violently struggling in the 
ath agony. 
“You see I miss him!” remarked Henry. He had fired from 
listance of more than a hundred and fifty yards, and both balls 
d passed through the lungs—the true mark in shooting buffalo. 
The darkness increased, and a driving storm came on. Tying 
r-horses to the horns of the victims, Henry began the bloody 
wk. of dissection, slashing away with the science of a connois- 
w,:while I vainly endeavored to imitate him. Old Hendrick 
railed with horror and indignation when I endeavored to tie 
eat to the strings of rawhide, always carried for this pur- 
dangling at the back of the saddle. After some difficulty 
came his scruples; and heavily burdened with the more 
le portions of the buffalo, we set out on our return. Scarcely

issued upon the open prairie, when the pricking sleet came driving, 
gust upon gust, directly in our faces. It was strangely dark, 
though wanting still an hour of sunset. The freezing storm soon 
penetrated to the skin, but the uneasy trot of our heavy-gaited 
horses kept us warm enough, as we forced them unwillingly in 
the teeth of the sleet and rain by the powerful suasion of our 
Indian whips. The prairie in this place was hard and level. A 
flourishing colony of prairie dogs had burrowed into it in every 
direction, and the little mounds of fresh earth around their holes 
were about as numerous as. the hills in a cornfield; but not a yelp 
was to be heard; not the nose of a single citizen was visible; all 
had retired to the depths of their burrows, and we envied them 
their dry and comfortable habitations. An hour’s hard riding 
showed us our tent dimly looming through the storm, one side 
puffed out by the force of the wind, and the other collapsed in 
proportion, while the disconsolate horses stood shivering c'- ~~ 
around, and the wind kept up a dismal whistling in the bough:

    the band of buffalo were transformed into certain clumps of tall 
bushes, dotting the prairie for a considerable distance: At this 
ludicrous termination of our chase, we followed the example o! 
our late ally and turned back toward the party. We were skirt! 
5 ing the brink of a deep ravine, when we saw Henry and the broad, 
chested pony coming toward us at a gallop. 
“Here’s old Papin and Frederic, down from Fort Laramie!’ 
. shouted Henry, long before he came up. We had for some days 
expected this encounter. Papin was the bourgeois of Fort Lara’ 
1o mie. He had come down the river with the buffalo robes and 
the beaver, the produce of the last winter’s trading. I had among 
our baggage a letter which I wished to commit to their hands; 
so, requesting Henry to detain the boats if he could until my 
return, I set out after the wagons. They were about, * 
1s in advance. In half an hour I overtook them, got | 
trotted back upon the trail, and looking carefully as ° 
a patch of broken, storm-blasted trees, and moving 
some little black specks like men and horses. Arrii 
place, I found a strange assembly. The boats, eleven 
20 deep-laden with the skins, hugged close to the shor:

  Laramie had occupied a full month, and the river was growing 
daily more shallow. Fifty times a day the boats had been 
aground; indeed, those who navigate the Platte invariably spend 
half their time upon sand-bars. Two of these boats, the property 
of private traders, afterward separating from the rest, got hope- 
lessly involved in the shallows, not very far from the Pawnee 
villages, and were soon surrounded by a swarm of the inhab- 
itants. They carried off everything that they considered valu- 
able, including most. of the robes; and amused themselves by 
tying up the men left on guard, and soundly whipping them with 
sticks. 
We encamped that night upon the bank of the river. Among 
the emigrants there was an overgrown boy, some eighteen years 
old, with a head as round and about as large as a pumpkin, and 
fever-and-ague fits had dyed his face of a corresponding color. 
He wore an old white hat, tied under his chin with a handkerchief; 
his body was short and stout, but his legs of disproportioned and 
| appalling length. I observed him at sunset breasting the hill The Buffalo 
then the boats swung around into the stream and floated away. 
They had reason for haste, for already the voyage from Fort

with gigantic strides, and standing against the sky on the summit 
like a colossal pair of tongs. In a moment after, we heard him 
screaming frantically behind the ridge, and nothing doubting 
that he was in the clutches of Indians or grizzly bears, some of 
8 the party caught up their rifles and ran to the rescue. His out- 
cries, however, proved but an ebullition of joyous excitement; 
he had-chased two little wolf pups to their burrow, and he was on 
| his knees; grubbing away like a dog at the mouth of the hole, 
to get-at them. 
© Before morning he caused more serious disquiet i in the camp. 
It was his turn to hold the middle guard; but no sooner was he 
called up. than he coolly arranged a pair of saddle-bags under a 
wagon, laid his head upon them, closed his eyes, opened his mouth, 
and fell asleep. The guard on our side of the camp, thinking it

anticipated, until the sun rose, and not a hoof or horn was in 
sight! The cattle were gone! While Tom was quietly slumber- 
ing, the wolves had driven them away. 
Then we reaped the fruits of R.’s. precious plan of traveling 
% in company with emigrants. To leave them in their distress was 
not to be thought of, and we felt bound to wait until the cattle 
could be searched for, and, if possible, recovered. But the reader 
may be curious to know what punishment awaited the faithless 
Tom. By the wholesome law of the prairie, he who falls asleep 
10 on guard is condemned to walk all day, leading his horse by the 
bridle, and we found much fault with our companions for not 
enforcing such a sentence on the offender. Nevertheless, had he 
been of our own party, I have no doubt he would in like manner 
have escaped scot-free. But the emigrants went further than 
15 mere forbearance; they decreed that since Tom couldn’t stand 
guard without falling asleep, he shouldn’t stand guard at all, and 
henceforward his slumbers were unbroken. Establishing such a 
premium on drowsiness could have no very beneficial effect upon 
the vigilance of our sentinels; for it is far from agreeable, after 
zo riding from sunrise to sunset, to feel your slumbers interrupted 
by the butt of a rifle nudging your side, and a sleepy voice growl- 
ing in your ear that you must get up, to shiver and freeze for 
three weary hours at midnight.

25 prairie by himself in misanthropic seclusion; but there ~*~+ +- 
more behind the hills. Dreading the monotony and I: 
the camp, Shaw and I saddled our horses, buckled ou:

“This won’t do at all,” said Shaw.

  man; I have an idea that one of us will need something of the 
sort before the day is over.” 
There was some foundation for such an apprehension, for the 
ground was none of the best for a race, and grew worse continu- 
ally as we proceeded; indeed it soon became desperately bad, 
consisting of abrupt hills and deep hollows, cut by frequent 
ravines not easy to pass. At length, a mile in advance, we saw 
a band of bulls. Some were scattered grazing over a green de- 
clivity, while the rest were crowded more densely together in the 
lo wide hollow below. Making a circuit to keep out of sight, we rode 
toward them until we ascended a hill within a furlong of them, 
beyond which nothing intervened that could possibly screen us 
from their view. We dismounted behind the ridge just out of 
sight, drew our saddle-girths, examined our pistols, and mounting 
8 again rode over the hill and descended at a canter toward them, 
bending close to our horses’ necks. Instantly they took the alarm; 
those on the hill descended; those below gathered into a mass, 
and the whole got in motion, shouldering each other along at a 
clumsy gallop. We followed, spurring our horses to full speed; 
0 and as the herd rushed, crowding and trampling in terror through 
an opening in the hills, we were close at their heels, half suffo-" 
cated by the clouds of dust. But as we drew near, their alarm 
and speed increased; our horses showed signs of the utmost fear, 
bounding violently aside as we approached, and refusing to enter 
5 among the herd. The buffalo now broke into several small bodies, 
scampering over the hills in different directions, and I Jost sight 
of Shaw; neither of us knew where the other had gone. Old 
Pontiac ran like a frantic elephant up hill and down hill, his 
ponderous hoofs striking the prairie like sledge-hammers. He 
30 showed a curious mixture of eagerness and terror, straining to 
overtake the panic-stricken herd, but constantly recoiling in 
dismay as we drew near. The fugitives, indeed, offered no very 
attractive spectacle, with their enormous size and weight, their 
shaggy manes and the tattered remnants of their last winter’s hair 
* covering their backs in irregular shreds and patches, and flying 
off in the’wind as they ran. At length I urged my horse close 
behind’a bull, and after trying in vain, by blows and spurring, to

bring him alongside, I'shot a bullet into the buffalo from this 
dlisadvantageous position. At the report, Pontiac swerved so 
much that I was again thrown a little behind the game. The 
bullet, entering too much in the rear, failed to disable the bull, 
3 for a buffalo requires to be shot at particular points or he will 
certainly escape. The herd ran up a hill, and I followed’ in pur- 
suit. As Pontiac rushed headlong down on the other side, I saw 
Shaw and Henry descending the hollow on the right at a leisurely 
gallop; and in front, the buffalo were just disappearing behind 
1o the crest of the next hill, their short tails erect and their hoofs 
twinkling through a cloud of dust. 
' At that moment I heard Shaw and Henry shouting to me; but 
the muscles of a stronger arm than mine could not have checked 
at once the furious course of Pontiac, whose mouth was as insen- 
1s sible as leather. Added to this, I rode him that morning with a 
common snaffle, having the day before, for the benefit «f mv oth

| mingled rage and distress, lowered his huge shaggy head for a 
charge. Pontiac, with a snort, leaped aside in terror, nearly 
throwing me to the ground, as I was wholly unprepared for such 
an evolution. I raised my pistol in a passion to strike him on the 
fs head, but thinking better of it, fired the bullet after the bull, who 
had resumed his flight; then drew rein, and determined to rejoin - 
my companions. - It was high time. The breath blew hard from 
Pontiae’s nostrils, and the sweat rolled in big drops down his 
sides; I myself felt as if drenched in warm water. Pledging 
o myself (and I redeemed the pledge) to take my revenge at a 
future opportunity, I looked round for some indications to show 
me where I was, and what course I ought to pursue. I might as 
well have looked for landmarks in the midst of the ocean. _How 
many miles I had run or in what direction, I had no idea; and 
5 around me the prairie was rolling in steep swells and pitches, 
without a single distinctive feature to guide me. I had a little 
compass hung at my neck; and ignorant that the Platte at this 
point diverged considerably from its easterly course, I thought 
that by keeping to the northward I should certainly reach it. So 
I turned and rode about two hours in that direction. The prairie 
changed as I advanced, softening away into easier undulations, 
but nothing like the Platte appeared, nor any sign of a human 
being; the same wild endless expanse lay around me still; and to 
all appearance I was as far from my object as ever. I began 
now to consider myself in danger of being lost; and therefore, 
reining in my horse, summoned the scanty share of woodcraft that 
I possessed (if that term be applicable upon the prairie) to ex- 
tricate me. Looking round, it occurred to me that the buffalo 
f might prove my best guides. I soon found one of the paths made 
» by them in their passage to the river; it ran nearly at right angles - 
to my course; but turning my horse’s head in the direction it 
indicated, his freer gait and erected ears assured me that I was 
p right. . 
But in the meantime my ride had been by no means a solitary 
one. The whole face of the country was dotted far and wide 
| with countless hundreds of buffalo. They trooped along in files ] 
(§ and columns, bulls, cows, and calves, on the green faces of the

right and left; and far off, the pale blue swells in the ext! 
tance were dotted with innumerable specks. Sometim 
prised shaggy old bulls grazing alone, or sleeping be

stupidly at me through their tangled manes, and the 
heavily away. The antelope were very numerous; ancl 
are always bold when in the neighborhood of buffalo, th: 
approach quite near to look at me, gazing intently w 
10 great round eyes, then suddenly leap aside and stretc 
away over the prairie as swiftly as a racehorse. Squalic|

saw horsemen; and riding near, with a mixture of hope an 
for Indians were abroad, I found them transformed into : 
28 of buffalo. There was nothing in human shape amid 
vast congregation of brute forms. 
When I turned down the buffalo path, the prairie seeme 
changed; only a wolf or two glided past at intervals ‘~~

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Biographical and Historical Note. Francis Parkman (1823-1893) was 
an American writer, born in Boston, where his father was a well-known 
clergyman. At the age of eight years he went to live with his grandfather 
on a wild tract of Jand near Boston, and there developed the fondness for 
outdoor life which is shown in all his writings. Parkman was graduated from 
Harvard Collegé in 1844, and from the Harvard Law School two years later, 
but he never practiced law. The journey related in his book, The Oregon 
Trail, from which “The Buffalo” is taken, was’ made immediately after 
Parkman completed his Jaw studies. His purpose was to gam an intimate 
knowledge of Indian life. From the Missouri River two great overland 
routes led across the country to the Pacific. One, the Santa Fe trail, car- 
ried a Jar-é overland trade with northern Mexico and southern California; 
the othor, the Oregon trail, was commonly used by emigrants on their way 
to the northwest coast. Parkman’s journey occupied about five months.

He left Boston m April, 1846, accompanied by Quincy Adams Shaw, a 
relative, and went first to St. Louis, the trip by railroad, steamboat, and 
Stage requiring about two weeks. Here they engaged two guides an 
cured an outfit, including a supply of presents for the Indians. Aftei 
days on a river steamboat they arrived at Independence, Missouri, 
the land journey began. 
In a newspaper item of March tenth, 1919, the following appeared: 
“For the first time in half a century bisons are on sale in Omaha. A herd of 
thirty-three, raised on a Colorado ranch, arrived at the stock yards yester- 
day. The meat will scll fer around $1.00 a pound.”

OLD EPHRAIM, THE GRIZZLY BEAR 
THEODORE ROOSEVELT 
VARIETIES OF BEAR 
The king of the game beasts of temperate North America, 
because the most dangerous to the hunter, is the grizzly bear; 
known to the few remaining old-time trappers of the Rockies and 
the Great Plains, sometimes as “Old Ephraim” and sometimes 
s as “Moccasin Joe”—the last in allusion to his queer, half-human. 
footprints, which look as if made by some misshapen giant, 
walking in moccasins. 
Bear vary greatly in size and color, no ‘less than in temper 
and habits. Old hunters speak much of them in their endless 
yo talks over the camp-fires and in the snow-bound winter huts. 
| They insist on many species; not merely the black and the grizzly, 
but.the brown, the cinnamon, the gray, the silver-tip, and others 
- with names known only in certain localities, such as the range 
bear, the roach-back, and the smut-face. But, in spite of popular 
8 opinion to the contrary, most old hunters are very untrustworthy 
in dealing with points of natural history. They usually know 
only so much about any given game animal as will enable them 
to kill it. They study its habits solely with this end in view; 
and once slain they only examine it to see about its condition and 
0 fur. With rare exceptions they are quite incapable of passing 
judgment upon questions of specifie identity or difference. When 
questioned, they not only advance perfectly impossible theories 
nd facts in support of their views, but they rarely even agree as 
o the views themselves. One hunter wil] assert that the true 
rizaly is only found im California, heedless of the fact that the 
tame was first used by Lewis and Clark as one of the titles they 
wpplied to the large bears of the plains country round the Upper 
Vissouri, a quarter of a century before the California grizzly was 
mown to fame. Another hunter will call any big brindled bear 
\ grizzly no matter where it is found; and he and his companions    
-P-A-G-E-33
  16 Junior High School Literature, Book One   
will dispute by the hour as to whether a bear of large, but not 
extreme, size is a grizzly or a silver-tip. In Oregon the cinnamon 
bear is a phase of the small black bear; in Montana it is the 
plains variety of the large mountain silver-tip. I have myself 
s seen the skins of two bears killed on the upper waters of Tongue 
River; one was that of a male, one of a female, and they had 
evidently just mated; yet one was distinctly a “silver-tip” and 
the other a “cinnamon.” The skin of one very big bear which I 
killed in the Bighorn has proved a standing puzzle to almost all 
1o the old hunters to whom I have shown it; rarely do any two of 
them agree as to whether it is a grizzly, a silver-tip, a cinnamon, 
or a “smut-face.” Any bear with unusually long hair on the 
spine and shoulders, especially if killed in the spring, when the 
fur is shaggy, is forthwith dubbed a “roach-back.” The average 
4s sporting writer, moreover, joins with the more imaginative mem- 
bers of the “old hunter” variety in ascribing wildly various traits 
to these different bears. One comments on the superior prowess 
of the roach-back; the explanation being that a bear in early 
spring is apt to be ravenous from hunger. The next insists that 
20 the California grizzly is the only really dangerous bear; while 
another stoutly maintains that it does not compare in ferocity 
with what he calls the “smaller” silver-tip or cinnamon. And 
so on, and so.on, without end. All of which is mere nonsense. 
Nevertheless, it is no easy task to determine how many species 
28 or varieties of bear actually do exist in the United States, and I 
cannot even say without doubt that a very large set of skins and 
skulls would not show a nearly complete intergradation between 
the most widely separated individuals. However, there are cer- 
tainly two very distinct types, which differ almost as widely from 
so each other as a wapiti does from a mule deer, and which exist in 
the same localities in most heavily timbered portions of the 
Rockies. One is the small black bear, a bear which will average 
about two hundred pounds weight, with fine, glossy, black fur, 
and the foreclaws but little longer than the hinder ones; in fact, 
88 the hairs of the forepaw often reach to their tips. This bear j isa 
tree climber. It is the only kind found east of the great plains, 
and it is also plentiful in the forest-clad portions of the Rockies,
-P-A-G-E-34
  Id Ephraim, the Grizzly Bear 17 
sing common in most heavily timbered tracts throughout the 
nited States. The other is the grizzly, which weighs three or 
yur times as much as the black, and has a pelt of coarse hair, 
hich is in color gray, grizzled, or brown of various shades. It 
not a tree climber, and the foreclaws are very long, much longer 
ian the hinder ones. It is found from the great plains west of 
1e Mississippi to the Pacific coast. This bear inhabits indiffer- 
atly lowland and mountain; the deep woods and the barren 
lains where the only cover is the stunted growth fringing the 
veams. These two types are very distinct in every way, and 
reir differences are not at all dependent upon mere geographical 
onsiderations; for they are often found in the same district. 
‘hus I found them both in the Bighorn Mountains, each type 
eing-in extreme form, while the specimens I shot showed no 
race of intergradation. The huge, grizzled, long-clawed beast, 
nd its little, glossy-coated, short-clawed, tree-climbing brother 
yamed over exactly the same country in those mountains; but 
hey were as distinct in habits, and mixed as little together as 
qoose and caribou. 
On the other hand, when a sufficient number of bears from 
tidely. separated regions are examined, the various distinguish- 
ag marks are found to be inconstant and to show a tendency— 
xactly how strong I cannot say—to fade into one another. The 
ifferentiation of the two species seems to be as yet scarcely com- 
25 pleted; there are more or less imperfect connecting links, and as 
regards the grizzly it almost seems as if the specific characters were 
still unstable. In the far Northwest, in the basin of the Columbia, 
the “black” bear is as often brown as any other color; and I have 
seen the skins of two cubs, one black and one brown, which were 
3 shot when following the same dam. When these brown bears 
have coarser hair than usual their skins are with difficulty to be 
distinguished from those of certain varieties of the grizzly. More- 
over, all bears vary greatly in size; and I have seen the bodies 
of very large black or brown bears with short foreclaws which 
33 were fully as heavy as, or perhaps heavier than, some small but 
full-grown grizzlies with long foreclaws. These very large bears 
with short claws are very reluctant to climb a tree; and are
-P-A-G-E-35
18 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
  almost as clumsy about it as is a young grizzly. Among the griz- 
zlies the fur varies much in color and texture even among bears of 
the same locality; it is of course richest in the deep forest, while 
the bears of the dry plains and mountains are of a lighter, more 
& washed-out hue. 
A full-grown grizzly will usually weigh from five to seven hun- 
dred pounds; but exceptional individuals undoubtedly reach more 
than twelve hundredweight. The California bears are said to be 
much the largest. This I think is so, but I cannot say it with 
10 certainty—at any rate, I have examined several skins of full- 
grown Californian bears which were no larger than those of many 
IT have seen from the northern Rockies. The Alaskan bears, par- 
ticularly those of the peninsula, are even bigger beasts; the skin 
of one which I saw in the possession of Mr. Webster, the taxider- 
1s mist, was a good deal larger than the average polar bear skin; 
and the animal when alive, if i good condition, could hardly 
have weighed less than 1400 pounds. Bears vary wonderfully 
in weight, even to the extent of becoming half as heavy again, 
according as they are fat or lean; in this respect they are more 
20 like hogs than like any other animals. 
_ HABITS OF BEAR 
The grizzly is now chiefly a beast of the high hills and heavy 
timber; but this is merely because he has learned that he must 
rely on cover to guard him from man, and has forsaken the open 
ground accordingly. In old days, and in one or two very out-of- 
25 the-way places almost to the present time, he wandered at wit! 
over the plains. It is only the wariness born of fear which now- 
adays causes him to cling to the thick brush of the large river 
bottoms throughout the plains country. When there were no 
rifle-bearing hunters in the land, to harass him and make him 
30 afraid, he roved hither and thither at will, in burly self-confi- 
dence. Then he cared little for cover, unless as a weather-break, 
or because it happened to contain food he liked. If the humor 
seized him he would roam for days over the rolling or broken 
prairie, searching for roots, digging up gophers, or perhaps fol- 
3s lowing the great buffalo herds either to prey on some unwary
-P-A-G-E-36
Old: Ephraim, the Grizzly Bear 19 
  ‘straggler which he was able to catch at a disadvantage in a wash- 
out, or else to feast on the carcasses of those which died by acci- 
dent. Old hunters, survivors of the long-vanished ages when 
the vast herds thronged the high pjains and were followed by 
5 the wild red tribes, and by bands of whites who were scarcely 
less savage, have told me that they often met bears under such 
circumstances; and these bears, were accustomed to sleep in a 
patch of rank sage bush, in the niche of a washout, or under the 
lee of a bowlder, seeking their food abroad even in full daylight. 
19 The bears of the Upper Missouri basin—which were so light in 
color that the early explorers often alluded to them as gray or 
even as “white”—were particularly given to this life in the open. 
To this day that close kinsman of the grizzly known as the bear 
of the barren grounds continues to lead this same kind of life, in 
1s the far north. _My friend, Mr. Rockhill, of Maryland, who was 
the first white man to explore eastern Tibet, describes the large 
grizzly-like bear of those desolate uplands as having similar habits. 
However, the grizzly is a shrewd beast and shows the usual 
bear-like capacity for adapting himself to changed conditions. 
20 He has in most places become a cover-haunting animal, sly in his’ 
ways, wary to a degree, and clinging to the shelter of the deepest 
forests in the mountains and of the most tangled thickets in the 
plains. Hence he has held his own far better than such game as 
the bison and elk. He is much less common than formerly, but 
2s he is still to be found throughout most of his former range; save, 
of course, in the immediate neighborhood of the large towns. 
In most places the grizzly hibernates, or, as old hunters say, 
“holes up,” during the cold season, precisely as does the black 
bear; but, as with the latter species, those animals which live 
30 farthest south spend the whole year abroad in mild seasons. The 
grizzly rarely chooses that favorite den of his little black brother, 
a hollow tree or log, for his winter sleep, seeking or making some 
cavernous hole in the ground instead. The hole is sometimes in 
a slight hillock in a river bottom, but more often on a hill-side, 
35 and may be either shallow or deep. In the mountains it is gener- 
ally-a natural cave in the rock, but among the foot-hills and on 
the plains the bear usually has to take some hollow or opening,
-P-A-G-E-37
    
20 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
and then fashion it into a burrow to his liking with his big digging 
claws. 
Before the cold weather sets in, the bear begins to grow rest- 
less, and to roam about seekjng for a good place in which to hole 
sup. One will often try and abandon several caves or partially 
dug-out burrows in succession before finding a place to its taste. 
Tt always endeavors to choose a spot where there is little chance 
of discovery or molestation, taking great care to avoid leaving 
too evident trace of its work. Hence it is not often that the 
io dens are found. 
Once in its den the bear passes the cold months in lethargic 
sleep; yet, in all but the coldest weather, and sometimes even 
' then, its slumber is but ligt, and if disturbed it will promptly 
leave its den, prepared for fight or flight as the occasi: 
15 require. Many times when a hunter has stumbled on th 
resting-place of a bear and has left it, as he thought, wit 
presence being discovered, he has returned only to find 
crafty old fellow was aware of the danger all the tin, auuo 
sneaked off as soon as the coast was clear. But in veri 7s 
20 weather hibernating bears can hardly be wakened frow 
torpid lethargy. ‘ 
The length of time a bear stays in its den depends of course 
upon the severity of the season and the latitude and altitude of 
the country. : 
28 When the bear first leaves its den the fur is in very fin: 
but it speedily becomes thin and poor, and does not rec: 
condition until the fall. Sometimes the bear does not betr 
great hunger for a few days after its appearance; but in 
while it becomes ravenous. During the early spring, w 
30 woods are still entirely barren and lifeless, while the sr. 
lies in deep drifts, the lean, hungry brute, both madder. 
weakened by long fasting, is more of a flesh eater than 
other time. It is at this period that it is most apt to tv 
beast of prey, and show-its prowess either at the expense 
38 wild game, or of the flocks of the settler and the herds

Some are confirmed game and cattle killers; others are no:

yet others either are or are not, accordingly as the freak seizes 
them, and their ravages vary almost unaccountably, both with 
the season and the locality. 
AN EXCITING BEAR HUNT 
I spent much of the fall of 1889 hunting on the head-waters 
s of the Salmon and Snake in Idaho, and along the Montana boun- 
dary line from the Big Hole Basin and the head of the Wisdom 
River to the neighborhood of Red Rock Pass and to the north 
and west of Henry’s Lake. During the last fortnight my com- 
panion was the old mountain man named Griffeth or Griffin—t 
1» cannot tell which, as he was always called either “Hank” or 
“Griff.” He was a crabbedly honest old fellow,.and a very skillful 
hunter; but he was worn out with age and rheumatism, and his 
temper had failed even faster than his bodily strength. He 
showed me a greater variety of game than I had ever seen before 
1s in so short a time; nor did I ever before or after make 80 success- 
ful a hunt. But he was an exceedingly disagreeable companion 
on account of his surly, moody ways. I generally had to get up 
first, to kindle the fire and make ready breakfast, and he was 
very quarrelsome. Finally, during my absence from camp one 
20 day, while not very far from Red Rock Pass, he found my 
whiskey-flask, which I kept purely for emergencies, and drank all 
the contents. When I came back he was quite drunk. This was 
unbearable, and after some high words I left him, and struck off 
homeward through the woods on my own account. We had with 
25 us four pack and saddle horses; and of these I took a very intelli- 
gent and gentle little bronco mare, which possessed the invaluable 
trait of always staying near camp, even when not hobbled. I 
was not hampered with much of an outfit, having only my buffalo 
sleeping-bag, a fur coat, and my washing-kit, with a couple of 
39 spare pairs of socks and some handkerchiefs. A frying-pan, 
some salt, flour, baking-powder, a small chunk of salt pork, and 
a hatchet made up a light pack, which, with the bedding, I fast- 
ened across the stock saddle by means of a rope and a spare 
packing cinch. My cartridges and knife were in my belt; my 
38 compass and matches, as always, in my pocket. 1 walked, while  
-P-A-G-E-39
  22 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
the little mare followed almost like a dog, often without my 
having to hold the lariat which served as halter. 
The country was for the most part fairly open, as I kept near 
the foot-hills where glades and little prairies broke the pine forest. 
5 The trees were of small size. There was no regular trail, but the 
course was easy to keep, and I had no trouble of any kind save 
on the second day. That afternoon I was following a stream 
which at last “canyoned up”—that: is, sank to the bottom of a 
canyon-like ravine impassable for a horse. I started up a side 
10 valley, intending to cross from its head coulies to those of an- 
other valley which would lead in below the canyon. 
However, I got enmeshed in the tangle of winding valleys at 
the foot of the steep mountains, and as dusk was coming on I 
halted and camped in a little open spot by the side of a small, 
15 noisy brook, with erystal water. The place was carpeted with 
soft, wet, green moss, dotted red with the kinnikinnic berries, 
and at its edge, under the trees where the ground was dry, I threw 
down the buffalo bed on the mat of sweet-smelling pine needles. 
Making camp took-but a moment. I opened the pack, tossed the 
20 bedding on a smooth'spot, knee-haltered the little mare, dragged 
up a few dry logs, and then strolled off, rifle on shoulder, through 
the frosty gloaming, to sce if I could pick up a grouse for supper. 
For half a mile I walked quickly and silently over the pine 
needles, across a succession of slight ridges separated by narrow, 
28 shallow valleys. The forest here was composed of lodge-pole 
pines, which on the ridges grew close together, with tall slender 
trunks, while in the valleys the growth was more open. Though 
the sun was behind ‘the mountains there was yet plenty of light 
by which to shoot, but it was fading rapidly. 
so At last, as I was thinking of turning toward camp, I stole up 
. to the crest of one of the ridges, and looked over into the valley 
some sixty yards off. Immediately I caught the loom of some 
large, dark object; and another glance showed me a big grizzly 
walking slowly off with his head down. He was quartering to 
88 me, and I fired into his flank, the bullet, as I afterward found, 
ranging forward and piercing one lung. At the shot he uttered a 
loud, moaning grunt and plunged forward at a heavy gallop, while
-P-A-G-E-40
  
ld Ephraim, the Grizzly Bear 23 
raced obliquely down the hill to cut him off. After going a few 
indred feet he reached a laurel thicket, some thirty yards broad, 
id two or three times as long, which he did not leave. I ran up 
the edge and there halted, not liking to venture into the mass 
‘twisted, close-growing stems and glossy foliage. Moreover, as 
halted, I heard him utter a peculiar, savage kind of. whine from 
ie heart of the brush. Accordingly, I began to skirt the edge, 
anding on tiptoe and gazing earnestly to see if I could not catch 
glimpse of his hide. When I was at the narrowest part of the 
licket, he suddenly left it directly opposite, and then wheeled 
id stood broadside to me on the hill-side, a little above. He 
ined his head stiffly toward me; scarlet strings of froth hung 
‘om his lips; his eyes burned like embers in the gloom. 
I held true, aiming behind the shoulder, and my bullet shat- 
red the point or lower end of his heart, taking out a big nick. 
astantly the great bear turned with a harsh roar of fury and 
iallenge, blowing the bloody foam from his mouth, so that I saw 
1e gleam of his white fangs; and then he charged straight at me, 
rashing and bounding through the laurel bu... s, so that it was 
ard-to aim. I waited until he came to a fallen tree, raking him 
s he topped it with a ball which entered his chest and went 
rough the cavity of his body, but he neither swerved nor 
inched, and at the moment I did not know that I had struck him. 
le came steadily on, and in another second was almost upon 
ie. I fired for his forehead, but my bullet went low, entering his 
pen mouth, smashing his lower jaw and going into the neck. I 
saped to one side almost as I pulled trigger; and through the 
anging smoke the first thing I saw was his paw as he made a 
icious side blow at me. The rush of his charge carried him 
ast. As he struck he lurched forward, leaving a pool of bright 
lood where his muzzle hit the ground; but he recovered himself 
od made two or three jumps onward, whue I hurriedly jammed 
couple of cartridges into the magazine, my rifle holding only 
our, all of which I had fired. Then he tried to pull up, but as 
e did so his muscles seemed suddenly to give way, his head 
rooped, and he rolled over and over like a shot rabbit. Each 
f my first three bullets had inflicted a mortal wound.

It was already twilight, and I merely opened the carcass, a

much labor took off the skin. The fur was very fine, the ani 
being in excellent trim, and unusually bright-colored. Unfort

place with one of plaster. The beauty of the trophy, and 
memory of the circumstances under which I procured it, mal 
me value it perhaps more highly than any other inr ~ 
This is the only instance in’ which I have beer 
to charged by a grizzly. On the whole, the danger of hu 
great bears has been much exaggerated. At the begin 
present century, when white hunters first encountered 
he was doubtless an exceedingly savage beast, prone vw uous 
without provocation, and a-redoubtable foe to persons ¢

But at present, bitter experience has taught him caution. He u

in the very wildest districts, he has learned to be more wary: 
20 a deer, and to avoid man’s presence almost as carefully as t 
most timid kind of game. Except in rare cases h 
of his own accord, and, as a rule, even when wor 
is escape rather than battle. 
Still, when fairly brought to bay, or when mo 
25 fit of ungovernable anger, the grizzly is beyond

  nimal which has retreated into a dense thicket, and has been 
ace or twice roused; and such a beast, when it does turn, will 
sually charge again and again, and fight to the last with un- 
onquerable ferocity. The short distance at which the bear can 
e seen through the underbrush, the fury of its charge, and_ its 
macity of life make it necessary for the hunter on such occa- 
ons to have steady nerves and a fairly quick and accurate aim. 
6 is always well to have two men in following a wounded bear 
nder such conditions. This is not necessary, however, and a 
ood hunter, rather than lose his quarry, will, under ordinary cir- 
imstances, follow and attack it, no matter how tangled the fast- 
ess in which it has sought refuge; but he must act warily and 
‘ith the utmost caution and resolution, if he wishes to escape a 
xrible and probably fatal mauling. An experienced hunter is 
arely rash, and never heedless; he will not, when alone, follow 
wounded bear into a thicket, if by the exercise of patience, skill, 
nd knowledge of the game’s habits he can avoid the necessity; 
ut it is idle to talk of the feat as something which ought in no 
ase to be attempted. While danger ought never to be needlessly 
icurred, it is yet true that the keenest zest in sport comes from 
i$ presence, and from the consequent exercise of the qualities 
ecessary td overcome it. The most thrillmg moments of an 
Merican hunter’s life are those in which, with every sense on 
ae alert, and with nerves strung to the highest point, he is fol- 
»wing alone into the heart of its forest fastness the fresh and 
loody footprints of an angered grizzly; and no other triumph of 
merican hunting can compare with the victory to be thus gained.

DEESA’S PLAN FOR A VACATION 
Once upon a time there was a coffee-planter in India who ' 
wished to clear some forest land for coffee-planting. When he 
had cut down all the trees and burned the underwood, the stumps 
ill remained. Dynamite is expensive and slow fire slow. The 
appy medium for stump-clearing is the lord of all beasts, who is. 
ie elephant. He will either push the stump out of the ground 
‘ith his tusks, if he has any, or drag it out with ropes. The 
lanter, therefore, hired elephants by ones and twos and threes, 
nd fell to work. The very best of all the elephants belonged to

iahout, which would never have been the case under native rule: 
or Moti Guj was a creature to be desired by kings, and his name, 
eing translated, meant the Pearl Elephant. Because the British 
overnment was in the land, Deesa, the mahout, enjoyed his 
toperty undisturbed. He was dissipated. When he had made 
uch money through the strength of his elephant, he would get 
<tremely drunk and give Moti Guj a beating with a tent-peg 
ver the tender nails of the forefeet. Moti Guj never trampled 
1e life out of Deesa on these occasions, for he knew that after 
ie beating was over, Deesa would embrace his trunk and weep 
ad call him his love and his life and the liver of his soul, and 
ve him some liquor. Moti Guj was very fond of liquor—arrack 
wx choice, though he would drink palm-tree toddy if nothing 
atter offered. Then Deesa would go to sleep between Moti Guj’s 
wefeet, and as Deesa generally chose the middle of the public

“Call Chihun, who comes from Deesa’s village,” said the 
planter. “Chihun, has this man got a wife?” 
“He?” said Chihun. “No. Not a woman of our village would 
- look at him. They’d sooner marry the elephant.” 
/ Chihun snorted: Deesa wept and bellowed. 
“You will get into a difficulty in a minute,” said the planter. 
Go back to your work!” 
“Now I will speak Heaven’s truth, ”” gulped Deesa, with an 
ispiration. “I haven’t been drunk for two months. I desire to 
epart in order to get properly drunk afar off and distant from

taster. One could snatch all manner of nice things from the 
vad-side then. 
“But you, you fussy old pig, must stay behind and work.”.

elsewhere. 
“Hi! hol Gome back, you!” shouted Chihun. “Come back 
and put me on your neck, misborn mountain! Return, splendor 
of ‘the hill-sides! Adornment of all India, heave to, or I’ll bang 
every toe off your fat forefoot!” 
Moti Guj gurgled gently, but did not obey. Chihun ran after 
him with a rope and caught him up. Moti Guj put his ears for-

it off with high words.

other elephants who had just set to work. 
Chihun reported the state of affairs to the planter, who came 
out with a dog-whip: and cracked it furiously. Moti Guj paid 
the white man the compliment of charging him nearly a quarter 
of a mile across the clearing and “Hrrumphing” him into his 
veranda. Then he stood outside the house, chuckling to himself

rest of the silent hours are filled with eating and fidgeting, and 
; long grumbling soliloquies. 
I At midnight, therefore, Moti Guj strode out of his pickets, for- 
is a thought had come to him that Deesa might be lying drunk 
. somewhere in the dark forest with none to look after him. So all. 
| that night he chased through the undergrowth, blowing and trum- 
| peting and shaking his ears. He went down to the river and 
", blared across the shallows where Deesa used to wash him, but. 
‘pf there was no answer. He could not find Deesa, but he disturbed 
'f all the other elephants in the lines, and nearly frightened to death 
some gypsies in the woods. 
i At dawn Deesa returned to the plantation. He had been very 
\ drunk indeed, and he expected to get into trouble for outstaying- 
his leave. He drew a long breath when he saw that the bunga-- 
| low and the plantation were still uninjured, for he knew some-. 
~ ing of Moti Guj’s temper, and reported himself with many 
xs and salaams. Moti Guj had gone to his pickets for break- 
st. The night exercise had made him hungry. 
“Call up your beast,” said the planter; and Deesa shouted 
the mysterious elephant language that some mahouts believe- 
me from China at the birth of the world, when elephants and 
men were masters. Moti Guj heard and came. Elephants do. 
t gallop. They move from places at varying rates of speed. 
an elephant wished to catch an express train he could not gallop,. 
tt he could catch the train. So Moti Guj was at the planter’s. 
door almost before Chihun noticed that he had left his pickets. 
He fell into Deesa’s arms, trumpeting with joy, and the man and 
beast wept and slobbered over each other, and handied each 
other from head to heel to see that no harm had befallen. 
f “Now we will get to work,” said Deesa. “Lift me up, my son 
yand my joy!” 
Moti Guj swung him up, and the two went to the coffee-- 
clearing to look for difficult: stumps. 
The planter was too astonished to be very angry.

  The Elephants That Struck 35 
THE ELEPHANTS THAT STRUCK 
SAMUEL WHITE BAKER 
I remember an occasion many years ago when in Ceylon I, 
* in connection with my brother, had organized a scheme for the 
evelopment of a mountain sanitarium at Newera Ellia. We 
ad a couple of tame elephants employed in various works; but 
;was necessary to obtain the assistance of the government stables 
or the transport. of very heavy machinery, which could not be 
} conveyed in the ordinary native carts. There were accordingly 
a large number of elephant wagons drawn by their colossal teams, 
, some of which required four elephants. 
No It was the wet season upon the mountains. Our settlement 
| was 6200 feet above the sea, and the zigzag pass from Ram- 
boddé, at the base of the steep ascent, was fifteen miles in length. 
1 The crest of the pass was 7000 feet in altitude, from which we 
| descended 800 feet to the Newera Ellia plain. 
The elephant wagons having arrived at Ramboddé from 
Colombo, about 100 miles distant, commenced the heavy uphill 
+ journey. The rain was unceasing, the roads were soft, and the 
heavily laden wagons sank deeply in the ruts; but the elephants 
were mighty beasts, and, laying their weight against the work, 
they slowly dragged the vehicles up the yielding and narrow 
way. : 
The abrupt zigzags bothered the long wagons and their still 
longer teams. The bridges over dangerous chasms entailed the 
necessity of unloading the heavier carts, and caused great delay. 
Day after day passed away; but although the ascent was slow, 
the wagons. still moved upwards, and the region of everlasting 
mist (at that season) was reached. Dense forests clothed the 
mountain sides; the roar of waterfalls resounded in the depths of 
black ravines; tangled bamboo grass crept upwards from the wet 
soil into the lower branches of the moss-covered trees, and formed 
& green curtain impenetrable to sight.

no summit to the mountain, and no end to the steep a: 
ascent; it would be, therefore, useless to persevere. in 
efforts. They determined, under these heart-breaki: 
20 stances, to strike work; and they did strike. 
One morning a couple of the elephant drivers appeared at, x 
house in Newera Ellia, and described the situation. ™ 
clared that it was absolutely impossible to induce th: 
to work; they had given it up as a bad job!

  “marking time” on the part of the elephants, which simply moved 
? their legs mechanically up and down, and swung their trunks to 
und fro; but none would pull or exert the slightest power, neither 
lid they move forward a single inch! 
I never saw such an instance of passive and determined ob- 
tinacy; the case was hopeless. 
An idea struck me. I ordered the drivers to detach the four 
lephants from the harness, and to ride them thus unfettered up 
he pass, following behind my horse. It appeared to.me that if 
he elephants were heart-broken, and in despair at the apparently 
aterminable mountain pass, it would be advisable to let them 
now the actual truth, by showing them that they were hardly 
wo miles from the summit, where they would exchange their 
phill labor for a descent into Newera Ellia; they should then 
ave an extra feed, with plenty of jaggery (a coarse brown 
agar). If they passed an agrecable night, with the best of 
ood and warm quarters, they would possibly return on the fol- 
| lowing day to their work, and with lighter hearts would put their 
shoulders to the wheel, instead of yielding to a dogged attitude 
en of despair. 
The success of this ruse was perfect. The elephants accom- 
ganied me to Newera Ellia, and were well fed and cared for. On 
she following day we returned to the heavy work, and I myself 
witnessed their start with the hitherto unyielding wagon. Not 
* snly did they exert their full powers, and drag the lumbering 
vad straight up the fatiguing hill without the slightest hesitation, 
ut their example, or some unaccountable communication between 
iem, appeared to give general encouragement. I employed the 
1ost willing elephants as extras to each wagon, which they drew 
>the summit of the pass, and then returned to assist the others— 
ius completing what had been pronounced by the drivers as 
tterly impossible. There can be no doubt that the elephants. 
ad at once perceived the situation, and in consequence recovered 
ieir lost courage. .

Biography. William Cullen Bryant (1794-1878) was the first great 
American. poet. He was reared among the rugged Berkshire Hills of 
western Massachusetts. Outside the district school, he had little teaching 
except. that. given by his mother and what he gave himself through the 
excellent library of his father, who was a country physician. He grew up in 
close touch with nature and the simple farm surroundings, and this lonely 
life may have tended to make him rather more serious and thoughtful than 
most boys of his age. By the time he was nine years old he was putting 
his thoughts: into verse in the stately fashion of the English poets of that 
time. In 1811, when yet scarcely eighteen, he wrote “Thanatopsis, ” now 
one of: the: world’s classics...

  By this time he had studied two years at a private school an 
seven months at Williams College. He was ambitious to ¢ 
his studies at Yale, but his father’s circumstances compelled him 
up that hope and to face the immediate problem of earning his own 
He studied law and was admitted to practice in 1815. After a fev 
he went to New York, where in 1825 he became editor of the Eventi 
—a position which he continued to fill with distinction for more thuuw 
a century, until his death in 1878. 
And yet this busy editor of a great city newspaper found leisure from 
time to time to cultivate his love for verse and to continue to write poetry. 
His poems were popular with Americans because he chose for the most 
part American subjects taken from his own immediate surroundings and 
experience—-the scenes and impressions of his boyhood, the flowers, the 
birds, the hills, the climate of his own-New England. 
America’s first men of letters whose writings proved that the new 
republic could produce a literature worthy to be compared with that of 
the mother country were James Fenimore Cooper, writer of Indian tales; 
Washington Irving, writer of legends about America and the sketches 
about our old English home; and William Cullen Bryant. Cooper showed 
the strangeness and romance of frontier life: Irving tried to give to 
America the romantic background that the new country lacked. Bryant 
opened men’s eyes to the beauty of nature. 
Though Bryant was eleven years younger than Irving, his “Thana- 
topsis” was written only two years after Irving’s “Knickerbocker.” 
Note. The bobolink is an American song bird. In t: 
is mostly black and white, while the female is streak: 
brown. In midsummer the male bobolink molts, taking: 
plumage like that of his “Quaker wife.” In the spring hi 
and buff colors without molting any feathers. He sings « 
The bobolink makes long migrations extending from Cai

the South, where he is known as the ricebird, or reedbird.

And sleeps as the last vibration dies. 
Sweet bird! I would that I could be 
‘A hermit in the crowd, like thee! 
With wings to fly to wood and glen, 
- Thy lot, like mine, is cast with men; 
And, daily, with unwilling feet, 
I tread, like thee, the crowded street; 
But, unlike me, when day is o’er, 
Thou canst dismiss the world, and soar; 
Or, at a half-felt wish for rest, 
Canst smooth the feathers on thy breast, 
And drop, forgetful, to thy nest. 
I would that, on such wings of gold, 
T could my weary heart upfold; 
I would I could look down unmoved 
(Unloving as I am unloved), 
And while the ‘world throngs on beneath, 
Smooth down my cares and calmly breathe; 
And, never sad with others’ sadness, 
And never glad with others’ gladness, 
Listen, unstirred, to knell or chime, 
And, lapped in quiet, bide my time.

  THE DAFFODILS 
WILLIAM WORDSWORTH 
- I wandered lonely as a cloud 
That floats on high o’er vales and hills, 
When all at once I saw a crowd, 
A host, of golden daffodils; 
Beside the lake, beneath the trees, 
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. 
Continuous as the stars that shine 
And twinkle on the milky way, 
They stretched in never-ending line 
Along the margin of a bay: 
Ten thousand saw I at a glance, 
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance. 
The waves beside them danced; but they 
Outdid the sparkling waves in glee; 
A poet could not but be gay 
Tn such a jocund company; 
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought 
What wealth the show to me had brought; 
For oft when on my couch I lie 
In vacant or in pensive mood, 
They flash upon that inward eye 
Which is the bliss of solitude; 
And then my heart with pleasure fills, 
And dances with the daffodils.

  THE TRAILING ARBUTUS 
JOHN G. WHITTIER 
I wandered lonely where the pine-trees made 
Against the bitter East their barricade, 
And, guided by its sweet, 
Perfume, I found, within a narrow dell, 
The trailing spring flower tinted like a shell 
Amid dry leaves and mosses at my feet. 
From under dead boughs, for whose loss the pines 
Moaned ceaseless overhead, the blossoming vines 
Lifted their glad surprise, 
While yet the bluebird smoothed in leafless trees 
His feathers ruffled by the chill: sea-breeze, 
And snow-drifts lingered under April skies. 
As, pausing o’er the lonely flower I bent, 
I thought of lives thus lowly, clogged, and pent, 
Which yet find room, 
Through care and cumber, coldness and decay, 
To lend a sweetness to the ungenial day, 
And make the sad earth happier for their bloom. 
NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Biography. John Greenleaf Whittier (1807-1892) was born near the 
little town of Haverhill, Massachusetts, in the same county as Salem, the 
birthplace of Hawthorne. The old farmhouse in which Whittier was born 
was built by the poet’s great-great-grandfather. It still stands to mark the 
site of the old home. His family were Quakers, sturdy of stature as of 
character. Whittier’s boyhood was in complete contrast to that of Lowell 
or Longfellow. He led the life of a typical New England farm boy, used 
to hard work, no luxuries, and few pleasures. His library consisted of prac- 
tically one book, the family Bible, which was later supplemented by a copy 
of Burns’s poems, loaned him by the district schoo]master.. Whittier is often 
compared with Burns in the simple homeliness of his style, his patriotism, 
his fiery indignation at wrong, and his sympathy with the humble and 
the oppressed.

  NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Biography. Robert Burns (1759-1796) was a Scottish poet, whose home 
was near Ayr, in Scotland. His life was short and filled with poverty 
and hardship, but he saw beauty in the common things of life and had a 
heart full of sympathy. He wrote this poem at a time when he was in 
great trouble. His farm was turning out badly, the soil was sour and wet, 
his crops were failures, and he saw nothing but ruin before him. Burns’s 
tenderness and sympathy are shown in the feeling expressed in this poem 
at crushing the flower. 
Discussion. 1. How does the English daisy, which Burns describes in 
the first line of the poem, differ from the daisy that you know, the American 
daisy? 2. Select and give the meaning of words that illustrate Burns’s use 
of the Scotch dialect. 3. Picture the incident related in the first stanza. 
4. What do you know about the lark that helps you to understand why it 
is called the daisy’s “companion” and “neebor’? 5. What comparison is 
made between the daisy and the garden flowers? 6. What “share” is men- 
tioned in stanza 5? 7. What characteristic of the flower does Burns seem to 
like best?

Biography. John Keats (1795-1821) was of humble birth, being the 
son of a, London stablekeeper. He lived at the time of Wordsworth, Byron, 
Shelley, and Leigh Hunt, from all of whom he gathered inspiration. His 
years were few, and his fame did not come while he was living. He had a 
passion for beauty, which found expression in all his poetry. On account of 
failing health he went to Rome in 1820, where he died the year following. 
Discussion. 1. Why does the poet say sweet peas are “on tiptoe for a 
flight”? 2. What are the wings of the sweet pea? 3. The poet tells of the

  THE GREAT BLIZZARD 
HAMLIN GARLAND - 
_A blizzard on the prairie corresponds to a storm at sea; it never 
aveler twice alike. Each norther seems to have a 
tack all its own. One storm may be short, sharp, 
and malevolent, while another approaches slowly, 
vearing out the souls of its victims by its inexorable 
tinued cold and gloom. One threatens for hours 
es, the other leaps like a tiger upon the defenseless 
itching the children unhoused, the men unprepared; 
of this character was the first blizzard Lincoln ever saw. 
The day was warm and sunny. The eaves dripped musically, 
; | and the icicles dropping from the roof fell occasionally with pleas- 
‘{ ant crash. The snow grew slushy, and the bells of wood teams 
’ | jingled ‘merrily all the forenoon, as the farmers drove to their 
, timber-lands five or six miles away. The room was uncomfort- 
ably warm ‘at times, and the master opened the outside door. It 
was the eighth day of January. One afternoon recess, as the boys. 
were playing in their shirt-sleeves, Lincoln called Milton’s atten~ 
i ‘ at cloud rising in the west and north. A vast, slaty~

  - blue, seamless dome, silent, portentous, with edges of sil 
frosty light. 
“It's going to storm,” said Milton. “It always does whe 
have a south wind and a cloud like that in the west.” 
6 When Lincoln set out for home, the sun was still shining, 
the edge of the cloud had crept, or more properly slid, across 
sun’s disk, and its light was growing cold and pale. In fift 
minutes more the wind from the south ceased—there wa: 
moment of breathless pause, and then, borne on the wings of 
ze north wind, the streaming clouds of soft, large flakes of si 
drove in a level line over the homeward-bound scholars, stick: 
to their clothing and faces and melting rapidly. It w: 
cold enough to freeze, though the wind was colder. Th 
darkness troubled Lincoln most. 
1s By the time he reached home, the wind was a gale, t 
s vast blinding cloud, filling the air and hiding the road. 
, ness came on instantly, and the wind increased in power, 
ae though with the momentum of the snow. Mr. Stewart cai 
home early, yet the breasts of his horses were already ¢ : 
2¢ inshow. Other teamsters passed, breasting the storm, am 
cheerily to their horses. One team, containing a woman a 
two men, neighbors living seven miles north, gave up the conte 
and turned in at the gate for shelter, confident that they wou 
be able to go on in the morning. In the barn, while rubb 
26 ice from the horses, the men joked and told stories in ¢ 
spirit, with the feeling generally that all would be well & 
light. The boys made merry also, singing songs, popping cor 
playing games, in defiance of the storm. 
But when they went to bed, at ten o’clock, Lincoln fi 
8 vague premonition of a dread disturbance of nature, far 
any other experience in his short life. The wind howled ie t 
thousand tigers, and the cold grew more and more intense. T 
wind seemed to drive in and through the frail.tenement; wat 
and food began to freeze within ten feet of the fire. 
36 Lincoln thought the wind at that hour had attained its utmx 
fury, but when he awoke in the morning, he saw how mist 
had been. He crept to the fire, appalled by the steady,

implacable clamor of the storm. It was like the roarings of all 
the lions of Africa, the hissing of a wilderness of serpents, the 
We lashing of great trees. It benumbed his thinking, it appalled his 
heart, beyond any other force he had ever known. 
ut,: ‘The house shook and snapped, the snow beat in muffled, rhyth-

‘far, now near and all-surrounding; producing an effect of mys- 
he tery and infinite reach, as though the cabin were a helpless boat, 
* yo tossing on an angry, limitless sea. 
ng Looking cut, there was nothing to be seen but the lashing of 
““ “"e wind and snow. When the men attempted to face it, to go to 
ie rescue of the cattle, they found the air impenetrably filled 
‘ith fine, powdery snow, mixed with the dirt caught up from the 
lowed fields by a terrific blast, moving ninety miles an hour. 
3 was impossible to see twenty feet, except at long intervals. 
incoln could not see at all when facing the storm. When he ., 
‘epped into the wind, his face was coated with ice and dirt, as 
y a dash of mud—a mask which blinded the eyes, and instantly 
‘oze to his cheeks. Such was the power of the wind that he 
ould not breathe an instant unprotected. His mouth being once 
den, it was impossible-to draw breath again without turning 
om the wind. 
The day was spent in keeping warm and in feeding the stock 
» the barn, which Mr. Stewart reached by desperate dashes, 
iring the momentary clearing of the air following some more 
.an usually strong gust. Lincoln attempted to water the horses 
| from the pump, but the wind blew the water out of the pail. So 
“old had the wind become that a dipperful, thrown into the air, 
all as ice. In the house it became more and more difficult to 
bundanee, 
Oh, that terrible day! Hour after hour they listened to that 
rodigious, appalling, ferocious uproar. All day Lincoln and 
wen moved restlessly to and fro, asking each other, “Won’t it

On the third day the family rose with weariness, and loo

Biography. Hamlin Garland (1860-—) was born in Wisconsin. 
father was a farmer-pioneer, who, always eager to be wpon the border 
of agricultural development, moved from Wisconsin to Minnésota, fi 
Minnesota to Iowa, and from Iowa to Dakota. The hope of cheaper ac 
better soil, and bigger crops lured him on. 
When Hamlin Garland turned his attention to literature he was 7 
enough to see the literary value of his early experiences. He resol 
to interpret truthfully the life of the western farmer and its great hardst 
and limitations, no Jess than its hopes, joys, and achievements. In d 
this, through a succession of short stories and novels, he won fame : 
success. In A Son of the Middle Border, an autobiography, he has writ 
an intensely interesting and valuable record of typical experienc: 
development of the Middle West. This selection is taken from Bo:

HANNAH F. GOULD 
The Frost looked forth on a still, clear night, 
And whispered, “Now, I shall be out of sight; 
So, through the valley, and over the height, 
Tn silence I'll take my way. 
T will not go on like that blustering train, 
The wind and the snow, the hail and the rain, 
That make such a bustle and noise in vain; 
But I'll be as busy as they!” 
So he flew to the mountain, and powdered its crest; 
He lit on the trees, and their boughs he dressed 
With diamonds and pearls; and over the breast 
Of the quivering lake, he spread 
A coat of mail, that it need not fear 
The glittering point of many a spear 
Which he hung on its margin, far and near, 
'. Where a rock could rear its head. 
He went to the window of those who slept, 
And over each pane like a fairy crept; 
Wherever he breathed, wherever he stepped, 
By the morning light were seen 
Most beautiful things!—there were flowers and trees, 
There were bevies of birds and swarms of bees; 
There were cities and temples and towers; and these 
All pictured in silvery sheen! 
But he did one thing that was hardly fair— 
He peeped in the cupboard, and finding there 
That all had forgotten for him to prepare,

THE SNOW STORM 
RALPH WALDO EMERSON 
Announced by all the trumpets of the sky 
Arrives the snow, and, driving o’er the fields, 
Seems nowhere to alight; the whited air 
Hides hills and woods, the river and the heaven, 
And veils the farmhouse at the garden’s end. 
The steed and traveler stopped, the courier’s feet 
Delayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit 
Around the radiant fireplace, enclosed 
In 2 tumultuous privacy of storm. 
Come, see the north wind’s masonry. 
Out of an unseen quarry evermore 
Furnished with tile, the fierce artificer 
Curves his white bastions with projected roof 
Round every windward stake, or tree, or door. 
Speeding, the myriad-handed, his wild work 
So fanciful, so savage, naught cares he 
For number or proportion. Mockingly 
On coop or kennel he hangs Parian wreaths; 
A swan-like form invests the hidden thorn; 
Fills up the farmer’s lane from wall to wail, 
Mauger the farmer’s sighs, and at the gate 
A tapering turret overtops the work. 
And when his hours are numbered, and the world 
Is all his own, retiring, as he were not,

oston, born not far from Franklin’s birthplace. He was the oldest. among 
chat brilliant group of New England scholars and writers that developed 
under the influence of Harvard College. Emerson was a quiet boy, but that 
oe had high ambitions and sturdy determination is shown by the fact that 
ae worked his own way through college. He is best known for his essays, 
tull of noble ideas and wise philosophy, but he also wrote poetry. Asa poet 
ae was careless of his meter, making his lines often purposely rugged, 
out they are always charged and bristling with thoughts that shock 
and thrill like electric batteries. In 1836 he wrote the “Coneerd Hymn” 
containing the famous lines: 
“Here once the embattled farmers stood . 
And fired the shot heard round the world!” 
tlis poems of nature are clear-cut and vivid as snapshots, “The Humble 
Bee,” as a critic puts it, “seems almost to shine with the heat and light of 
summer.”

Descends the snow.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Biography. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-1882) was born in 
Portland, Maine. In “The Courtship of Miles Standish” he has made us 
acquainted with his azicestors, John Alden and Priscilla Mullens, passengers 
on the Mayflower. 
Longfellow's education was obtained in Portland and at Bowdoin 
College, where he had for classmates several youths who afterward became 
famous, notably, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Franklin Pierce. Upon Long- 
fellow’s graduation, the trustees of the college, having decided to estab- 
lish a chair of modern Janguages, proposed that this young graduate should 
fit himself for the position. Three years, therefore, he spent in delightful 
study and travel in France, Spain, Italy,-and Germany. Here was laid 
the foundation for his scholarship, and, as in Irving on his first European

  trip, there was kindled that passion for romantic lore which followed him 
through life and which gave direction to much of his work. He mastered the 
language of each country visited, in a remarkably short time, and many of 
the choicer poems found in these languages he has given to us in English. 
After five years at Bowdoin, Longfellow was invited in 1834 to the 
chair of modern languages in Harvard College. Again he was given an 
opportunity to prepare himself by a year of study abroad. In 1836 he 
began his active work at Harvard and took up his residence in the historic 
Craigie House, overlooking the Charles River—a house in which Wash- 
ington had been quartered for some months when he came to Cambridge 
in 1775 to take command of the Continental forces. Longfellow was 
thenceforth one of the most prominent members of that group of men 
including Sumner, Hawthorne, Agassiz, Lowell, and Holmes, who gave 
distinction to the Boston and Cambridge of earlier days. 
For twenty years Longfellow served as a teacher, introducing hundreds 
of students to the literature of modern Europe. In his poetry, too, he 
exerted a powerful influence for bringing about a relationship between 
America and European civilization. He was thus a poet of culture, render- 
ing a great service at a time when the thought of America was provincial. 
He was also a poet of the household, writing many poems about the joys and 
sorrows of home life, poems of aspiration and religious faith, poems about 
village characters as well as about national heroes. He excels, too, as a 
writer of tales in verse. “Evangeline,” a story of the Acadian exiles and 
their wanderings; “The Courtship of Miles Standish,” a story of early 
colonial life in Massachusetts; and “Hiawatha,” an Indian epic into which 
he put'a vast amount of legendary matter belonging to the first owners of 
our country, are examples of his power in sustained verse narrative. His 
ballads, such as “The Skeleton in Armor” and “The Wreck of the Hesperus,” 
show his power to handle a legend in brief and stirrmg form. He was a 
writer of almost perfect sonnets, and a writer of prose of distinction. The 
most loved and most widely known of American poets, Longfellow helped 
to interpret our common life in terms of beauty.

The speckled sky is dim with snow, 
The light flakes falter and fall slow; 
Athwart the hilltop, rapt and pale, 
Silently drops a silvery veil; 
And all the valley is shut in 
By flickering curtains gray and thin. 
_ But cheerily the chickadee 
~Singeth to me on fence and tree; 
The snow sails round him as he sings, 
White as the down on angels’ wings. 
I watch the snow flakes as they fall 
On bank and brier and broken wall; 
Over the orchard, waste and brown, 
All noiselessly they settle down, 
Tipping the apple boughs and each 
‘Light quivering twig of plum and peach. 
On turf and curb and bower roof 
The snowstorm spreads its ivory woof; 
It paves with pearl the garden walk; 
And lovingly round tattered stalk 
And shivering stem its magic weaves 
A mantle fair as lily leaves. 
The hooded beehive, small and low, 
Stands like a maiden in the snow; 
And an old door slab is half hid 
Under an alabaster lid

  All day it snows; the sheeted post 
Gieams in the dimness like a ghost; 
All day the blasted oak has stood 
A muffled wizard of the wood; 
Garland and airy cap adorn 
The sumac and the wayside thorn, 
And clustering spangles lodge and shine 
In the dark tresses of the pine. 
The ragged bramble, dwarfed and old, _ 
Shrinks like a beggar in the cold; 
In surplice white the cedar stands, 
And blesses him with priestly hands. 
Still cheerily the chickadee 
Singeth to me on fence and tree; 
But in my inmost ear is heard 
The music of a holier bird; 
And heavenly thoughts as soft and white 
As snowflakes on my soul alight, 
Clothing with love my lonely heart, 
Healing with peace each bruiséd part, 
Till all my being seems to be 
Transfigured by their purity.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Biography. William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was the greatest. English 
poet, and was one of the greatest poets the world has ever known. He 
wrote for all times and all peoples. He was born at Stratford-on-Avon, 
where fifty-two years later he died. At the age of twenty-two he removed 
to London, where for twenty years he wrote poems and plays, was an actor, 
and later a shareholder in the theater. The last six years of his life he spent 
quietly at Stratford. 
This song is from the comedy As You Like It, a story of the adventures 
of a group of courtiers and rustics in the forest of Arden. A charming 
element in Shakespeare’s romantic comedies is the introduction of song- 
poems or lyrics. All the writers of those days, the days of Good Queen 
Bess, wrote songs. England was “a nest of singing birds.” They were 
real songs, too, filled with joy and musical language, and all the people 
sang them to the accompaniment of the quaint musical instruments of 
the time. And all the people took part in games and pageants in “Merrie 
England,” and listened to the strange tales of seafarers, and went to the 
playhouse to see Shakespeare’s As You Like It. 
Discussion. 1. Why is the thought of green holly appropriate in con- 
nection with the winter wind? 2. What feeling does ingratitude arouse? 
3. Why does the poet say the “tooth” of the wind is not so keen as man’s 
ingratitude? 4. What change of feeling do you notice after line 6? 5, 
What do you think caused the change? 6. In the second stanza. read lines 
that show the poet did not really think that “life is most jolly.” 7. Which 
lines explain the poet’s distrust of friendship? 8. Which word in stanza 1 
is explained by line 3 of stanza 2? 9. Find a word in stanza I that gives 
the same thought as the second line of the second stanza. 10. Give the 
meaning of “warp” in stanza 2 (an old Saxon proverb said, “Winter shall 
warp water”).

ee ADVENTURES OLD AND NEW 
. INTRODUCTION 
Along with our interest in the world of animals and the plant 
world and the seasons, we are curious to know about people. 
A good deal of our conversation is about what others say or do. 
And when we say of a man, “He does things,” we pay him the 
highest. possible compliment. : 
Ever since man came on the earth he has been “doing things.” 
Centuries ago, a man found out how to make fire by striking 
pieces of flint together. Then other men discovered strange 
things that might be done by means of the mysterious flame 
that sprang up. Another man ventured over the hill or mountain 
out into the unknown world beyond, or far across the blue water 
that seemed to reach to the end of the world. And when the 
traveler returned, men listened eagerly to his stories. So from 
earliest days men who ventured beyond the beaten track and 
did things their fellows were too lazy or too timid to think of 
doing have ‘been interesting to those who stayed at home. In 
such ways ships were built to carry voyagers to strange places. 
In such ways commerce sprang up, for these adventurers brought 
back new foods and new objects, and knowledge of men who lived 
in strange places. In such ways islands and continents were 
discovered and settled, and men made war for the possession of 
rich territories, and life for all men became more varied and 
interesting through the adventures of the daring ones. For life 
is full of zést and interest only in proportion as the spirit of 
adventure enters into it. 
Tha mon in former times who stood out above their fellows 
eds were the subjects of song and story. 
in all times have put into words the wonder 
ae people for the doer of great deeds. Some 
you will read in the pages that follow—just 
nds of stories of adventure that men have 
89

told in song and prose tale. Some of these stories introduce 
King Arthur and his Round Table, in the days of chivalry, when 
knighthood was in flower. A few of them are old ballads, which 
are tales made by the people or by some of their number, and 
sung by the people or by minstrels, or by mothers to their children, 
and so handed down from one generation to another. And some 
of them are very recent indeed, for they spring out of the heroic 
deeds of men in the World War that ended in November, 1918. 
This spirit of adventure that makes men willing to face danger, 
and even death, to get some new experience or to render some 
service, the spirit that makes some men explore strange places, 
or seek for the South Pole, or fight in great battles—this spirit 
of adventure never dies. Sometimes the story is of a knight clad 
in armor, and sometimes it is about a man in khaki who died the 
other day that his fellows might live—the spirit is the same. Men 
no longer dress like Lancelot, or like George Washington, but 
they do the same sort of things. And people like to read of these 
things or hear the stories told just as much now as they did when 
the first traveler returned to the little village in Greece, or when 
Sir Gareth and Sir Gawain won their victories, or when General 
‘Putnam or Mad Anthony Wayne, in our Revolutionary War, per- 
formed some brave act for the American cause. And now, all over 
the world, groups gather about the soldier who has returned from 
Flanders Fields with his stories of valor. Always the spirit of 
adventure lives; always we like to hear what it brings back to 
us of news-about life. If we have had no chance yet to do a thing 
worth men’s praise, we get a larger view of life, a better sense of 
what life really means, from reading or hearing such stories. 
And we mean to do brave things ourselves, some day, so the stories 
thrill us with the sense of what life holds for us. 
These things we must remember, then, as we read. Through 
these stories we become partners in all the brave deeds of the 
past. And, again, the spirit of adventure is ever-living and is 
as keen today as in the past. And, finally, by such stories our 
own knowledge of the fine qualities of human nature is increased 
and our own experience enlarged so that we become braver 
and better because we see what wonderful things life can bring,

THE DAYS OF CHIVALRY 
  THE COMING OF ARTHUR 
OF THE BIRTH OF ARTHUR AND HOW HE BECAME KING 
Long years ago, there ruled over Britain a king called Uther 
Pendragon. A mighty prince was he, and feared by all men; 
yet, when he sought the love of the fair Igraine of Cornwall, she 
would have naught to do with him, so that, from grief and dis- 
3 appointment, Uther fell sick, and at last seemed like to die. 
Now in those days, there lived a famous magician named 
Merlin, so powerful that he could change his form at will, or even 
make himself invisible; nor was there any place so remote but 
that he could reach it at once, merely by wishing himself there. 
10 One day, suddenly he stood at Uther’s bedside, and said: 
“Sir King, I know thy grief, and am ready to help thee. Only 
promise to give me, at his birth, the son that shall be born to 
thee, and thou shalt have thy heart’s desire.” , 
To this the King agreed joyfully, and Merlin kept his word: 
1s for he gave Uther the form of one whom Igraime had loved dearly, 
and so she took him willingly for her husband. 
When the time had come that a child should be born to the 
King and Queen, Merlin appeared before Uther to remind him 
. . ei .
-P-A-G-E-109
    92 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
of his promise; and Uther swere it should be as he had said. 
Three days later, a prince was born and, with pomp and cere- 
mony, was christened by the name of Arthur; but immediately 
thereafter the King commanded that the child should be carried 
5 to the postern-gate, there to be given to the old man who would 
be found waiting without. 
Not long after, Uther fell sick, and he knew that his end was 
come; so, by Merlin’s advice, he called together his knights and 
barons and said to them: 
10 “My death draws near. I charge you, therefore, that ye obey 
"_ my son even as ye have obeyed me; and my curse upon him if he 
claim not the crown when he is a man grown.” 
Then the King turned his face to the wall and died. 
Searcely was Uther laid in his grave before disputes arose. 
1s Few of the nobles had seen Arthur or even heard of him, and 
not one of them would have been willing to be ruled by a child; 
rather, each thought himself fitted to be king, and, strengthening 
his own castle, made war on his neighbors until confusion alone 
was supreme, and the poor groaned because there was none to 
20 help them. 
Now when Merlin carried away Arthur-—for Merlin was the 
old man who had stood at the postern-gate—he had known all 
that would happen, and had taken the child to keep him safe from 
the fierce barons until he should be of age to rule wisely and well, 
25 and perform all the wonders prophesied of him. He gave the child 
to the care of the good knight Sir Ector to bring him up with his 
son Kay, but revealed not to him that it was the son of Uther 
Pendragon that was given into his charge. 
At last, when years had passed and Arthur was grown a tall 
30 youth well skilled in knightly exercises, Merlin went to the Arch- 
bishop of Canterbury and advised him that he should call together 
at Christmas-time all the chief men of the realm to the great 
eathedral in London. 
“For,” said Merlin, “there shall be seen a great marvel by 
35 which it shall be made clear to all men who is the lawful king of 
this land.” The Archbishop did as Merlin counseled. Under 
pain of a fearful curse, he bade barons and knights come to
-P-A-G-E-110
  The Goming of Arthur 93   
London to keep the feast, and to pray heaven to send peace to 
the realm. 
The people hastened to obey the Archbishop’s commands and, 
from all sides, barons and knights came riding in to keep the 
8 birth-feast of our Lord. And when they had prayed, and were 
coming forth from the cathedral, they saw a strange sight. There, 
in the open space before the church, stood, on a great stone, an 
anvil thrust through with a sword; and on the stone were written 
these words: 
10 “Whoso can draw forth this sword is rightful King of Britain 
| born.” : 
At once there were fierce quarrels, each man clamoring to be 
the first to try his fortune, none doubting his own success. Then 
the Archbishop decreed that each should make the venture in 
1s turn, from the greatest baron to the least knight; and each in 
turn, having put forth his utmost strength, failed to move the 
sword one inch, and drew back ashamed. So the Archbishop 
dismissed the company, and having appointed guards to watch, 
over the stone, sent messengers through all the land to give word 
20 of great jousts to be held in London at Easter, when each knight 
could give proof of his skill and courage, and try whether the 
adventure of the sword was for him. 
Among those who rode to London at Easter was the good Sir 
Ector, and with him his son, Sir Kay, newly made a knight, and 
.2 the young Arthur. When the morning came that the jousts 
| should begin, Sir Kay and Arthur mounted their horses and set 
out for the lists; but before they reached the field, Kay looked . 
and saw that he had left his sword behind. Immediately Arthur 
turned back to fetch it for him, only to find the house fast shut, 
| 30 for all were gone to view the tournament. Sore vexed was Arthur, 
‘fearing lest his brother Kay should lose his chance of gaining 
| glory, till, of a sudden, he bethought him of the sword in the 
great anvil before the cathedral. Thither he rode with all speed, 
and the guards having deserted their posts to view the tourna- 
5 ment, there was none to forbid him the adventure. He leaped 
from his horse, seized the hilt, and instantly drew forth the sword 
as easily as from a scabbard; then, mounting his horse and think- SOE ge 
i
-P-A-G-E-111
94 Junior High School Literature, Book One   
ing no marvel of what he had done, he rode after his brother and 
handed him the weapon. 
When Kay looked at it, he saw at once that it was the won- 
drous sword from the stone. In great joy he sought his father, 
5 and showing it to him, said: 
“Then must I be King of Britain.” 
But Sir Ector bade him say how he came by the sword, and 
when Sir Kay told how Arthur had brought it to him, Sir Eetor 
bent his knee to the boy and said: 
10 “Sir, I perceive that ye are my King, and here I tender you 
my homage”; and Kay did as his father. Then the three sought 
the Archbishop, to whom they related all that had happened; and 
he, much marveling, called the people together to the great stone, 
and bade Arthur thrust back the sword and draw it forth again 
1s in the presence of all, which he did with ease. But an angry 
murmur arose from the barons, who cried that what a boy could 
do, a man could do; so, at the Archbishop’s word, the sword was 
put back, and each man, whether baron or knight, tried in his 
turn to draw it forth, and failed. Then, for the third time, Arthur 
20 drew forth the sword. Immediately there arose from the people 
a great shout: 
“Arthur is King! Arthur is King! We will have no King but. 
Arthur”; and, though the great barons scowled and threatened, 
they fell on their knees before him while the Archbishop placed 
23 the crown upon his head, and they swore to obey him faithfully 
as their lord and sovereign. / 
Thus Arthur was made king; and to all he did justice, right- 
ing wrongs and giving to all their dues. Nor was he forgetful of 
those that had been his friends; for Kay, whom he loved as a 
30 brother, he made seneschal and chief of his household, and to 
Sir Ector, his foster father, he gave broad lands.

-P-A-G-E-112
  The Coming of Arthur . . 9 
By Merlin’s advice Arthur sent for help overseas, to Ban 
and Bors, the two great Kings who ruled in Gaul. With their 
aid, he overthrew his foes in a fierce battle near the river Trent; 
and then he passed with them into their own lands and helped 
5 them drive out their enemies. So there was ever great friendship 
} between Arthur and the Kings Ban and Bors, and all their kin- 
! dred; and afterwards some of the most famous Knights of the 
} Round Table were of that kin. 
Then King Arthur set himself to restore order throughout his 
wkingdom. To all who would submit and amend their evil ways, 
he showed kindness; but those who persisted in oppression and 
wrong he removed, putting in their places others who would deal 
justly with the people. And because the land had become over- 
run with forest during the days of misrule, he cut roads through 
15 the thickets, that no longer wild beasts and men, fiercer than the 
beasts, should lurk in their gloom, to the harm of the weak and 
defenseless. Thus it came to pass that soon the peasant plowed 
his fields in safety, and where had been wastes, men dwelt again 
in peace and prosperity. 
2 Amongst the lesser kings whom Arthur helped to rebuild their 
towns and restore order was King Leodogran, of Cameliard. 
Now Leodogran had one fair child, his daughter Guinevere; and 
from the time that first he saw her, Arthur gave her all his love. 
So he sought counsel of Merlin, his chief adviser. Merlin heard 
. % the King sorrowfully, and said: 
( “Sir King, when a man’s heart is set, he may not change. Yet 
had it been well if ye had loved another.” 
| So the King sent his knights to Leodogran to ask of him his 
daughter; and Leodogran consented, rejoicing to wed her to so 
\” good and knightly a king. With great pomp, the princess was 
conducted to Canterbury, and there the King met her, and they 
| two were wed by the Archbishop in the great cathedral, amid the 
| rejoicings of the people. 
On that same day did Arthur found his Order of the Round 
35 Table, the fame of which was to spread throughout Christendom 
and endure through all time. Now the Round Table had been 
made for King Uther Pendragon by Merlin, who had meant
-P-A-G-E-113
    9 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
thereby to set forth plainly to all men the roundness of the earth. 
After Uther died, King Leodogran had possessed it; but when 
Arthur was wed, he sent it to him as a gift, and great was the 
King’s joy at receiving it. One hundred fifty knights might 
5 take their places about it, and for them Merlin made sieges, or 
seats. One hundred twenty-eight did Arthur knight at that 
great feast; thereafter, if any sieges were empty, at the high fes- 
tival of Pentecost new knights were ordained to fill them, and by 
magic was the name of each knight found inscribed, in letters of 
10 gold, in his proper siege. One seat only long remained unoccu- 
pied, and that was the Siege Perilous. No knight might occupy 
it until the coming of Sir Galahad; for, without danger to his life, 
none might sit there who was not free from all stain of sin. 
With pomp and ceremony did each knight take upon him the 
15 vows of true knighthood: to obey the King; to show mercy to all 
who asked it; to defend the weak; and for no worldly gain to 
fight in a wrongful cause; and all the knights rejoiced together, 
doing honor to Arthur and to his Queen. And all men of worship 
said it was merry to be under such a chieftain, that would put his 
29 person in adventure as other poor knights did. Then. they rode 
forth to right the wrong and help the oppressed, and by their aid, 
the King held his realm in peace, doing justice to all. 
OF THE FINDING OF EXCALIBUR 
Now when Arthur was first made king, as young knights will, 
he courted peril for its own sake, and often would he ride un- 
25 attended by lonely forest ways, seeking the adventure that chance 
might send him. All unmindful was he of the ruin to his realm 
if mischief befell him; and even his trusty counselors, though 
they grieved that he should thus imperil him, yet could not but 
love him the more for his hardihood. 
390 ~=—- So, on a, day, he rode through the Forest Perilous where dwelt 
the Lady Annoure, a sorceress of great. might, who used her magic 
powers but for the furtherance of her own desires. And as she 
looked from a turret window, she descried King Arthur come 
riding down a forest glade, and the sunbeams falling upon him 
38 made one glory of his armor and of his yellow hair. Then, as
-P-A-G-E-114
The Coming of Arthur 97 
  Annoure gazed upon the King, she resolved that, come what might, 
she would have him for her own, to dwell with her always and 
fulfill all her behests. And so she bade her men to lower the draw- 
bridge and raise the portcullis, and sallying forth accompanied by 
) s her maidens, she gave King Arthur courteous salutation, and 
prayed him that he would rest within her castle that day, for that 
: she had a petition to make to him; and Arthur, doubting nothing of 
| her good faith, suffered himself to be led within. 
, Then was a great feast spread, and Annoure caused the King 
9 be seated in a chair of state at her right hand, while squires 
nd pages served him on bended knee. So when they had feasted, 
ne King turned to the Lady Annoure and said courteously: 
“Lady, somewhat ye said of a request that ye would make. 
f there be aught in which I may give pleasure to you, I pray 
ou let me know it, and I will serve you as knightly as 
may.” . : 
“In truth,” said the lady, “there is that which I would fain 
atreat of you, most noble knight; yet suffer, I beseech you, that. 
rst I may show you somewhat of my castle and my estate, and 
aen will I crave a boon of your chivalry.” 
Then the sorceress led King Arthur from room to room of her 
astle, and ever each displayed greater store of beauty than the 
ist. In some the walls were hung with rich tapestries, in others — 
yey gleamed with precious stones; and the King marveled what 
light be the petition of one that was mistress of such wealth. 
astly, Annoure brought the King out upon the battlements, and 
s he gazed around him, he saw that since he had entered the 
astle there had sprung up about it triple walls of defense. that 
yut out wholly the forest from view. Then turned he to Annoure, 
nd gravely. said: 
“Lady, greatly I marvel in what a simple knight may give 
« uleasure to one that is mistress of so wondrous a castle as ye 
shown me here; yet if there be aught in which I may render 
mightly service, right gladly would I hear it now, for I must 
wth upon my way to render service to those whose knight I 
worn.” 
Nay, now, King Arthur,” answered the sorceress meckingly, + 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
  98 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
“ye may not deceive me! for well I know you, and that all Britain 
bows to your behest.” 
“The more reason then that I should ride forth to right wrong 
and succor them that, of their loyalty, render true obedience to 
8 their lord.” 
“Ye speak as a fool,” said the sorceress; “why should one that 
may command be at the beck and call of every hind and slave 
within his realm? Nay, rest thee here with me, and I will make 
thee ruler of a richer land than Britain, and satisfy thy every 
to desire.” 
“Lady,” said the King sternly, “I will hear and judge of your 
petition here and now, and then will I go forth upon my way.” 
“Nay,” said Annoure, “there needs not this harshness. I did 
but speak for thine advantage. Only vow thee to my service, and 
15 there is naught that thou canst desire that thou shalt not possess. 
Thou shalt be lord of this fair castle and of the mighty powers 
that obey me. Why waste thy youth in hardship and in the 
service of such as shall render thee little enough again?” 
Thereupon, without ever a word, the King turned him about 
0 and made for the turret stair by which he had ascended, but 
nowhere could he find it. Then said the sorceress, mocking 
him: 
“Fair sir, how think ye to escape without my goodwill? See 
ye not the walls that guard my stronghold? And think ye that 
25 I have not servants enough to do my bidding?” 
She clapped her hands and forthwith there appeared a 
pany of squires who, at her command, seized the King am 
him away to a strong chamber where they locked him in. 
And so the King abode that night, the prisoner of th ° 
:30 sorceress, with little hope that day, when it dawned, shoul 
him better cheer. Yet lost he not courage, but kept wat: 
vigil the night through, lest the powers of evil should ass: 
unawares. And with the early morning light, Annoure cuss. w 
visit him. More stately she seemed than the night bef 
.85 tall and more terrible; and her dress was one blaze of 
gems so that scarce could the eye look upon her. As 
might address a vassal, so greeted she the King, and «
-P-A-G-E-116
    The Coming of Arthur 99 .   
scending to one of low estate, asked how he had fared that night. 
And the King made answer: 
“I have kept vigil as behooves a knight who, knowing himself» 
to be in the midst of danger, would bear himself meetly in any 
s peril that should offer.” 
And the Lady Annoure, admiring his knightly courage, de- 
sired more earnestly even than before to win him to her will, and 
she said: 
“Sir Arthur, I know well your courage and knightly fame, and 
10 greatly do I desire to keep you with me. Stay with me and I 
promise that ye shall bear sway over a wider realm than any 
that ye ever heard of, and I, even I, its mistress, will be at your 
command. And what lose ye if ye accept my offer? Little 
enough; for never think that ye shall win the world from evil, and 
1s men to loyalty and truth.” 
Then answered the King in anger: “Full well I see-that thou 
art in league with evil and that thou but seekest to turn me from 
my purpose. I defy thee, foul sorceress. Do thy worst; though 
thou slay me, thou shalt never sway me to thy will”; and there- 
20 with, the King raised his cross-hilted sword before her. Then 
the lady quailed at that sight. Her heart was filled with hate, 
but she said: 
' "Go your way, proud King of a petty realm. Rule well your 
race of miserable mortals, since it pleases you more than to bear 
% sway over the powers of the air. I keep you not against your 
will.” 
With these words she passed from the chamber, and the King 
heard her give command to her squires to set him without her 
gates, give him his horse, and suffer him to go on his way. 
so And so it came to pass that the King found himself once more 
at large, and marveled to have won so lightly to liberty. Yet 
knew he not the depths of treachery in the heart of Annoure; for 
_ when she found she might not prevail with the King, she be- 
thought her how, by mortal means, she might bring him to | > 
35 dishonor and death. And so, by her magic art, she caused the 
, King to follow a path that brought him to a fountain, whereby a 
i knight had his tent, and, for the love of adventure, held the way

  against all comers. Now this knight was Sir Pellinore, and at 
that time he had not his equal for strength and knightly skill, 
nor had any been found that might stand against him. So, as 
the King drew nigh, Pellinore cried: 
5s “Stay, knight, for no one passes this way except he joust with 
me.” 
“That is not a good custom,” said the King; “and it were well 
that ye followed it no more.’ 
“Tt is my custom, and I will follow it still,” ” answered Pelli- 
10 nore; “if ye like it not, amend it if ye can.’ 
“T will do my endeavor,” said Arthur, “but, as ye see, I have 
no spear.” 
“Nay, I seek not to have you at disadvantage,” replied Pelli- 
nore, and bade his squire give Arthur a spear. Then they dressed 
1s their shields, laid their lances in rest, and rushed upon each other. 
Now the King was wearied by his night’s vigil, and the strength 
of Pellinore was as the strength of three men; so, at the first 
encounter, Arthur was unhorsed. Then said he: 
“J have lost the honor on horseback, but now will I encounter 
20 thee with my sword and on foot.” 
“T, too, will alight,” said Pellinore; “small honor to me were 
it if I slew thee on foot, I being horsed the while.” So they 
encountered each other on foot, and so fiercely they fought that 
they hewed off great pieces of each other’s armor, and the ground 
25 was dyed with their blood. But at the last, Arthur’s sword broke 
off short at the hilt, and so he stood ali defenseless before his foe. 
“JT have thee now,” cried Pellinore; “yield thee as recreant or 
I will slay thee.” 
“That will I never,” said the King; “slay me if thou canst.” 
so Then he sprang on Pellinore, caught him by the middle, and 
flung him to the ground, himself falling with him. And Sir Pelli- 
nore marveled, for never before had he encountered so bold and 
resolute a foe; but exerting his great strength, he rolled himself 
over, and so brought Arthur beneath him. Then Arthur would 
38 have perished, but at that moment Merlin stood beside him, and 
when Sir Pellinore would have struck off the King’s head, stayed 
his blow, erying:
-P-A-G-E-118
  The Coming of Arthur “401 
“Pellinore, if thou slayest this knight, thou puttest the whole 
realm in peril; for this is none other than King Arthur himself,” 
t Then was Pellinore filled with dread, and cried: 
| “Better make an end of him at once; for if I suffer him to 
s live, what hope have I of his grace, that have dealt with him so 
' sorely?” 
; But before Pellinore could strike, Merlin caused a deep sleep 
| to come upon him; and raising King Arthur from the ground, he 
stanclied his wounds and recovered him of his swoon. 
' 10 But when the King came to himself, he saw his foe lie, still as 
| in death, on the ground beside him; and he was grieved, and said: 
; ‘Merlin, what have ye done to this brave knight? Nay, if ye 
have slain him, I shall grieve my life long; for a good knight he 
is, bold‘and a fair. fighter, though something wanting in knightly 
15 courtesy.” , 
“He is in better case than ye are, Sir King, who so lightly 
imperil your person, and thereby your kingdom’s welfare; and, as 
ye say, Pellinore is a stout knight, and hereafter shall he serve 
you well. Have no fear. He shall wake again in three hours and 
20 have suffered naught by the encounter. But for you, it were well 
that ye came where ye might be tended for your wounds.” 
“Nay,” replied the King, smiling, “I may not return to my 
court thus weaponless; first will I find means to possess me of a 
sword.” 
% “That is easily done,” answered Merlin; “follow me, and I 
§ will bring you where ye shall get you a sword, the wonder of the 
world.” 
So, though his wounds pained him sore, the King followed 
Merlin by many a forest path and glade, until they came upon 
4 30 a mere, bosomed deep in the forest; and as he looked thereon, the 
King beheld an arm, clothed in white samite, above the surface 
of the lake, and in the hand was a fair sword that gleamed in 
the level rays of the setting sun. 
“This is a great marvel,” said the King, “what may it mean?” 
33 And Merlin made answer: “Deep is this mere, so deep indeed 
that no man may fathom it; but in its depths, and built upon

Powerful is she with a power that works ever for good, and she 
shall help thee in thine hour of need.” 
Anon the damsel herself came unto Arthur and said: “Sir 
Arthur, King, yonder sword is mine and if ye will give me a gift 
s when I ask it of you, ye shall have it.” 
“By my faith,” said Arthur, “I will give you what ye will ask.” 
Then was Arthur aware of a little skiff, half hidden among 
the bulrushes that fringed the lake; and leaping into the boat, 
without aid of oar, he was waited out into the middle of the lake, 
io to the place where, out of the water, rose the arm and sword. 
And leaning from the skiff, he took the sword from the hand, 
which forthwith vanished, and immediately thereafter the skiff 
bore him back to land. 
Arthur drew from its scabbard the mighty sword, wondering 
1s at the marvel of its workmanship, for the hilt shone with the 
elfin light of twinkling gems—diamond and topaz and emerald, 
and many another whose name none knows. And as he looked 
on the blade, Arthur was aware of mystic writings on the one side 
and the other, and calling to Merlin, he bade him interpret them. 
zo © “Sir,” said Merlin, “on the one side is written ‘Keep me,’ and 
on the other ‘Throw me away.’” 
“Then,” said the King, “which does it behoove me to do?” 
“Keep it,” answered Merlin; “the time to cast it away is not 
yet come. This is the good brand Excalibur, or Cut Steel, and 
25 well shall it serve you. But what think ye of the scabbard?” 
“A fair cover for so good a sword,” answered Arthur. 
“Nay, it is more than that,” said Merlin, “for so long as ye 
keep it, though ye be wounded never so sore, yet ye shall not bleed 
to death.” And when he heard that, the King marveled the more. 
30 Then they journeyed back to Caerleon, where the knights 
made great joy of the return of their lord. And presently, thither 
came Sir Pellinore, craving pardon of the King, who made but 
jest of his own misadventure. And afterwards Sir Pellinore be- 
came of the Round Table, a knight vowed, not only to deeds of 
35 hardihood, but also to gentleness and courtesy; and faithfully he 
served the King, fighting ever to maintain justice and put down 
wrong, and to defend the weak from the oppressor.

  The Coming of Arthur 103 
  NOTES AND QUESTIONS. 
Historical Note. The ancient Britons looked out from their little 
island home with its protecting seas, and pictured the great unknown world 
beyond as a fairyland filled with enchanted cities and wonderful forests, and 
peopled by friendly fairies and magicians. About the beginning of our 
Christian era the Romans came among them for a time, teaching them 
obedience to law. Later, the barbarian hordes came over the North Sea, 
to conquer them, But the invaders were resisted by strong leaders among 
whom one by the name of Arthur stands pre-eminent. Historians generally 
agree that a chieftain of this name actually lived about the close of the fifth 
century or the beginning of the sixth. Some say he was from the north, some 
from the south, of England. Arthur became not only the great national 
hero, but also the champion of Christianity against heathen invaders. He 
is said to have united the scattered British clans and to have defeated the 
invaders in twelve great battles. 
In their days of distress many of the Britons fled across the Channel 
and settled among their kindred, the Bretons of northern France. From 
here Welsh bards with their harps wandered throughout all Christendom, 
singing of Arthur’s heroic deeds. As time went on these tales of Arthur 
became blended with the fairy stories of their old happy dream-life. When 
chivalry was at its height, from the twelfth to the fifteenth century, the 
strolling minstrels took up the legend, adapting it to the ideals of the times 
and to the tastes of their audiences in court and castle and market place. 
In these songs and legends, Arthur appeared as a great king surrounded 
at his “Table Round” with valiant knights who, under vows of purity and 
holiness, went forth in daily quest of noble deeds. Early in the twelfth 
century the legends were carried back to England. A Welsh priest, Goeffrey 
of Monmouth, gave a form to these tales which became widely popular, 
and later from this version and others, Sir Thomas Malory wrote his story, 
“Le Morte D’Arthur” (The Death of Arthur}. In 1485, William Caxton, 
the first English printer, published Sir Thomas’s story, which became the 
chief source of modern poets who have written on this theme. Among 
these, the English poet, Tennyson, in his beautiful “Idylls of the King,” 
has told the story of Arthur and his knights. 
Britain at the time in which Arthur is supposed to have lived was a 
land of warring tribes. Christianity had gained little more than a foothold. 
It was an age in which might was greater than right. But when Arthur's 
knights went forth at the command of their king, their aim was to over- 
throw the injustice and lawlessness then so common in the land. Wonderful 
deeds were done by that little company of brave men, who rode abroad 
“redressing wrongs.”

THE STORY OF GARETH 
HOW BEAUMAINS CAME TO KING ARTHUR'S COURT 
King Arthur had a custom that at the feast of Pentecost he 
would not go to meat until he had heard or seen a great marvel. 
And because of that custom all manner of strange adventures 
came before him at that feast. 
: §o Sir Gawain, a little before noon of the day of Pentecost, 
saw from a window three men on horseback and a dwarf on foot, 
and one of the men was higher than the other two, by a foot and 
ahalf. Then Sir Gawain went unto the King and said, “Sir, go 
to your meat, for here at hand come strange adventures.” 
« Right so came into the hall two men and upon their shoulders 
there leaned the goodliest young man and the fairest that ever 
they all saw, and he was tall and large and broad in the shoulders 
and the fairest and largest-handed that ever man saw. 
This young man said, “King Arthur, God bless you and all 
your fair fellowship. For this cause I am come hither, to pray 
you to give me three gifts and they shall not be unreasonably 
asked, but you may honorably grant them me. The. first gift I 
will ask now and the other two I will ask this day twelvemonth.” 
“Now ask,” said Arthur, “and ye shall have your asking.” 
b “Sir,” said the young man, “this is my petition, that ye will 
| give me meat and drink for this twelvemonth, and at that day I 
will ask mine other two gifts.” 
“My fair son,” said Arthur, “ask better, I counsel thee, for 
this is but simple asking; for my heart tells me that thou shalt 
prove a man of right great honor.” 
“Sir,” said the young man, “be that as it may, I have asked 
that I will ask.” 
“Well,” said the King, “ye shall have meat and drink enough; 
Inever refused that to friend or foe. But what is thy name?” 
“I cannot tell you,” said the young man. 
“That is strange,” said the King, “that thou knowest not thy 
tame and thou art the goodliest young man that ever I saw.”
-P-A-G-E-123
  106 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
Then the King charged Sir Kay, the steward, that he should 
give the young man meat and drink of the best as though he 
were a lord’s son. 
“There is no need of that,” said Sir Kay, “for I am sure he is 
+ of lowly birth. If he had come of gentlemen he would have asked 
of you horse and armor, but such as he is, so he asketh. And as , 
he hath no name I shall name hiin Beaumains, that is Fair-hands, | 
and into the kitchen I shall take him.” 
Then was Sir Gawain wroth and Sir Lancelot bade Sir Kay 
10 stop his mocking of the young man. But Sir Kay bade the young 
man sit down to meat with the boys of the kitchen and there he 
ate sadly. And then Sir Lancelot bade him come to his chamber 
and there he should have meat and drink enough. And this Sir | 
Lancelot did of his great gentleness and courtesy. And Sir 
1s Gawain proffered him meat and drink, but he refused them both 
and thus he was put into the kitchen. 
So he endured all that twelvemonth and never displeased man 
nor child, but always he was meek and kindly. But ever when 
there was any jousting of knights, that would he see if he might. 
20 So it passed on till the feast of Pentecost. On that day there 
came a damsel into the hall and saluted the King and prayed for 
succor for her lady who was besieged in her castle. 
“Who is your lady and what is his name who hath besieged 
her?” asked the King. 
2 “Sir King,” she said, “my lady’s name shall ye not know from 
me at this time, but the tyrant that besiegeth her and destroyeth 
her lands is called the Red Knight of the Red Lands.” 
“I know him not,” said the King. 
“Sir,” said Sir Gawain, “I know him well; men say that hel 
39 hath seven men’s strength and from him I escaped once full hard 
with my life.” 
“Fair damsel,” said the King, “there be knights here would do 
their power to rescue your lady, but because you will not tell her| 
name, none of my knights shall go with you by my will.” 
35 Then Beaumains came before the King and said, “Si 
I have been this twelvemonth in your kitchen and now I | 
my two gifts.”
-P-A-G-E-124
  The Story of Gareth 107 
  “Ask,” said the King, “and right gladly will I grant them.” 
“Sir, these shall be my two gifts, first that ye will grant me’ 
to have this adventure.” 
“Thou shalt have it,” said the King. 
5s “Then, sir, this is the other gift, that ye shall -bid Sir Lancelot 
to make me knight. And I pray you let him ride after me and 
make me knight when I ask him.” 
“All this shall be duue,” said the King. 
“Fie on thee,” said the damsel, “shall I have none but one 
10 that is your kitchen boy?” 
Then was she wroth and took her horse and departed from - 
him. 
And with that there came one to Beaumains and told him his 
horse and armor were come and there was the dwarf ready with all 
“hings that he needed in the richest manner. So when he was 
rmed there were few so goodly men as he was. 
Then Sir Kay said all open in the hall, “I will ride after my 
oy of the kitchen, to see whether he will know me for his better.” 
nd as Beaumains overtook the damsel, right so came Sir Kay 
nd said, “Beaumains, what, sir, know ye not me?” 
“Yea,” said Beaumains, “I know you for an ungentle knight 
f the court and therefore beware of me.” 
Therewith Sir Kay put his spear in the rest and ran straight 
pon him, and Beaumains came as fast upon him with his sword 
_nd thrust him through the side, so that Sir Kay fell down as if 
“.e were dead and Beaumains took Sir Kay’s shield and spear and 
ode on his way. 
When Sir Lancelot overtook him, he proffered Sir Lancelot to 
oust and they came together fiercely and fought for an hour, and 
.ancelot marveled at Beaumains’ strength, for he fought more like 
\ giant than a knight. So Sir Lancelot said, “Beaumains, fight 
‘ot so sore; your quarrel and mine is not so great but we may 
eave off.” 
“Truly that is truth,” said Beaumains, “but it doth me good 
0 feel your might.” 
“Hope ye that I may any while stand a proved knight?” said 
Beaumains.
-P-A-G-E-125
108 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
“Yea,” said Lancelot, “do as ye have done and I shall be your 
warrant.” 
“Then I pray you,” said Beaumains, “give me the order of 
knighthood.” 
s “Then must ye tell me your name,” said Lancelot. 
“Sir,” he said, “my name is Gareth, and I am brother unto 
Sir Gawain.” 
“Ah, sir,” said Lancelot, “I am more glad of you than I was, 
for ever methought ye should be of great blood and that ye came 
10 not to the court for meat or drink.” , 
_ Then Sir Lancelot gave him the order of knighthood and 
departed from him and came to Sir Kay and made him to be 
borne home upon his shield and he was healed of his wound. 
But when Beaumains had overtaken the damsel, she said, 
15.“What dost thou here? Thou smellest of the kitchen, thy clothes 
be soiled with the grease and tallow that thou gainest in King 
Arthur’s kitchen. Therefore, turn again, dirty kitchen boy; I 
know thee well, for Sir Kay named thee Beaumains.” 
“Damsel,” said Beaumains, “say to me what ye will, I will 
20 not go from you, whatever ye say, for I have undertaken to King 
Arthur for to achieve your adventure and so shall I finish it to 
the end or I shall die therefor.” 
So thus as they rode in the wood, there came a man flying all 
that ever he might. “Whither wilt thou?” said Beaumains. 
23 “O lord,” he said, “help me, for six thieves have taken my lord 
and bound him, so I am afraid lest they will slay him.” 
“Bring me thither,” said Beaumains, 
_ And so they rode together until they came where the knight 
was bound and then he rode unto the thieves and slew them all 
zoand unbound the knight. And the knight thanked him and 
prayed him to ride with him to his castle and he should reward 
him for his good deeds. , 
“Sir,” said Beaumains, “I will no reward have; I was 
made knight of noble Sir Lancelot and therefore I will n. 
35 have but God reward me. Also I must follow this dam 
And when he came nigh her, she bade him ride from h 
thou smellest of the kitchen,” she said. Then the sam
-P-A-G-E-126
  The Story of Gareth 109 
which was rescued rode after the damsel and prayed them to 
lodge with him that night, and so that night they had good cheer 
and rest. 
And on the morrow the damsel and Beaumains rode on their 
s way until they came to a great forest. And there was a river 
and but one passage and there were two knights to prevent their 
crossing. “What sayest thou,” said the damsel, “wilt thou match 
yonder knights or turn again?” 
“Nay,” said Sir Beaumains, “I will not turn again if they were 
10 six more.” And therewith he rushed into the water and they 
drew their swords and smote at each other and Sir Beaumains 
slew both the knights. 
“Alas,” said the damsel, “that a kit¢hen boy should have the 
fortune to destroy two such brave knights.” 
1s =“Damsel,” said Beaumains, “I care not what ye Bay, so that, 
I may rescue your lady.” 
“Tf you follow me,” said the damsel, “thou art but slain, for 
I see all that ever thou dost is but by misadventure and not by 
might of thy hands.” 
2% “Well, damsel, ye may say what ye will, but wheresoever ye 
go, I will follow you.” 
So Beaumains rode with that lady till evening and ever she 
chid him and would not stop. And they came to a black plain 
and there was a black hawthorne and thereon hung a black shield 
25 and by it stood a black spear, great and long, and a great black 
horse covered with silk. 
HOW BEAUMAINS FOUGHT WITH THE FOUR KNIGHTS 
There sat a knight all armed in black armor and his name 
was the Knight of the Black Lands. And when the damsel came 
nigh he said, “Damsel, have ye brought this knight of King 
aq Arthur to be your champion?” “Nay, fair knight,” said she, 
“this is but a kitchen boy that was fed in King Arthur’s kitchen 
for alms.” 
“Why cometh he,” said the knight, “in such array? It is 
shame that: he beareth you company.” 
% = “Sir, I cannot be delivered of him; through mishap I saw 
   
-P-A-G-E-127
  
110 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
him slay two knights at the passage of the water and other deeds 
he did before right marvelous and by chance.” 
“IT marvel,” said the Black Knight, “that any man that is of 
honor will fight with him.” 
s “They: know him not,” said the damsel. 
“That may be,” said the knight, “but this much I shall grant 
you; I shall put him down upon foot, and his horse and his armo: 
- he shall leave with me, for it were shame to me to do him any 
more harm.” 
—aeee 
10 When Sir Beaumains heard him say thus, he said, “Sir Knight. | 
thou art full liberal of my horse and armor. I let thee know it | 
cost thee nought, and horse nor armor gettest thou none of mine | 
unless thou win them with thy hands.” 
Then in great wrath they departed with their horses and came 
as together as it had been thunder. When they had fought for an 
hour and a half the Black Knight fell down off his horse in swoon 
and there he died. And Beaumains armed him in his armor and 
took his horse and rode after the damsel. 
When she saw him come nigh, she said, “Away, kitchen boy, 
zo for the smell of thy clothes grieveth me. Alas, that a kitchen 
boy should by mishap slay so good a knight as thou hast done.” 
“T warn. you, fair damsel,” said Beaumains, “that I will not 
flee away nor leave your company for all that ye can say; there- 
fore, ride on your way, for follow you I will, whatsoever happen.” 
25 Thus as they rode together they saw a knight come driving 
by them all in green, both his horse and his armor, and when he 
came nigh the damsel, he asked her, “Is that my brother, the 
Black Knight, that ye have brought with you?” 
“Nay, nay,” she said, “this kitchen boy hath slain your 
30 brother,” 
“Ah! traitor,” said the Green Knight, “thou shalt die fc: 
of my brother.” 
“T defy thee,” said Beaumains, “for I slew him knightly and 
not shamefully.” 
as And then they ran together with all their might and 
a long while, and at last Beaumains gave the Green Kniy 
a buffet upon the helmet that he fell upon his knees. A
-P-A-G-E-128
The Story of Gareth 111 
the Green Knight cried for mercy and prayed Sir Beaumains to 
slay him not. 
“Fair knight,” said the Green Knight, “save my life and I 
will forgive thee the death of my brother and forever be thy man, 
sand thirty knights that follow me shall forever do you service.” 
“Sir Knight,” said Beaumains, “all this availeth thee not unless 
this damsel speak with me for thy life.” And therewith he made 
a motion as if to slay him. 
“Let be,” said the damsel, “slay him not, for if thou do thou 
1o shalt repent it. 
Then Beaumains said, “Sir Knight, I release thee at this 
Jamsel’s request.” 
And then the Green Knight kneeled down and did him homage 
‘ith his sword, and he said, “Ye shall lodge with me this night 
nd tomorrow I shall help you through this forest.” So they 
ok their horses and rode to his manor. 
And ever the damsel rebuked Beaumains and would not allow 
im to sit at her table. “TI marvel,” said the Green Knight, “why 
e rebuke this noble knight as ye do, for I warn you, damsel, he 
3a full noble knight and I know no knight is able to match him, 
aerefore you do great wrong to rebuke him.” 
And on the morrow they took their horses and rode on their 
tay and the Green Knight said, “My lord Beaumains, I and 
aese thirty knights shall be always at your summons both early 
nd late.” 
“Tt is well said,” said Beaumains; “when I call upon you ye 
aust yield you unto King Arthur and all your knights.” 
‘Tf ye so command us, we shall be ready at all times,” said 
he Green Knight. So then departed the Green Knight. 
So within a while they saw a town as white as any snow and 
he lord of the tower was in his castle and looked out at a window 
and saw a damsel and a knight. So he armed him hastily. And 
when he was on horseback, it was all red, both his horse and his 
armor. And when he came nigh he thought it was his brother, 
85 the Black Knight, and he cried aloud, “Brother, what do ye here?” . 
“Nay, nay,” said the damsel, “it is not he. This is but a 
kitchen boy. He hath killed thy brother, the Black Knight.
-P-A-G-E-129
112 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
Also I saw thy brother, the Green Knight, overcome by him. 
Now may ye be revenged on him.” 
With this the knights came together with all their might and 
fought furiously for two hours, so that it was wonder to see that 
s strong battle. Yet at the last, Sir Beaumains struck the Red 
Knight to the earth. And the Red Knight cried mercy, saying, 
“Noble knight, slay me not, and I shall yield me to thee with 
sixty knights that be at my command. And I forgive thee all 
thou hast done to me, and the death of my brother, the Black 
10 Knight.” 
“All this availeth not,” said Beaumains, “unless the damsel 
pray me to save thy life.” And therewith he made a motion as if 
to slay him, 
“Let be,” said the damsel; “slay him not, for he is a noble 
15 knight.” 
Then Beaumains bade the Red Knight stand up and the Red 
Knight prayed them to see his castle and rest there that night. 
And upon the morn he came before Beaumains with his three 
score knights and offered him his homage and service. 
zo “TI thank you,” said Beaumains, “but this ye shall grant me: 
to come before my lord King Arthur and yield you unto him to 
be his knight, when I call upon you.” 
“Sir” said the Red Knight, “I will be ready at your summons.” 
So Sir Beaumains departed and the damsel, and ever she rode 
25 chiding him. 
“Damsel,” said Beaumains, “ye are uncourteous to rebuke me 
as ye do, for I have done you good service.” 
“Well,” said she, “right soon ye shall meet a knight who shall 
pay thee all thy wages, for he is the greatest of the world, except 
30 King Arthur.” 
And soon there was before them a city rich and fair, and 
between them and the city there was a fair meadow and therein 
were many pavilions fair to behold. 
“Lo,” said the damsel, “yonder is a lord that owneth yonder 
35 city and his custom is when the weather is fair to joust in this 
meadow. And over there be about him five hundred knights and 
gentlemen of arms.”
-P-A-G-E-130
  The Story of Gareth 113 
“That goodly lord,” said Beaumains, “would I fain behold.” 
“Thou shalt see him time enough,” said the damsel, and so as 
she rode near she saw the pavilion where he was. “Lo,” said she, 
“seest thou yonder pavilion that is all blue of color, and the lerd’s 
sname is Sir Persant, the lordliest knight that ever thou lookedst 
on?” 
“It may well be,” said Beaumains, “but be he never so stout 
a knight, in this field I shall abide until I see him.” 
“Sir,” she said, “I marvel what thou art; boldly thou speakest, 
ao and boldly thou hast done, that have I seen; therefore I pray thee 
| save thyself, for thou and thy horse are weary and here I dread 
, me sore lest ye catch some hurt. But I must tell you that Sir 
| Persant is nothing in might unto the knight that laid the siege 
~bout my lady.” 
“As for that,” said Sir Beaumains, “since I have come so nigh 
2is knight, I will prove his might before I depart from him.” 
“Oh,” said the damsel, “I marvel what manner of man ye be, 
or so shamefully did never woman treat knight as I have done 
ou and ever courteously ye have borne it. Alas, Sir Beaumains, - 
orgive me all that I have said or done against thee.” 
“With all my heart,” said he, “I forgive you and now I think 
aere is no knight living, but I am able enough for him.” 
When Sir Persant saw them in the field, he sent to them to 
now whether Beaumains came in war or in peace. 
“Say to thy lord,” said Beaumains, “that shall be as he 
' leases.” 
And so Sir Persant rode against him, and his armor and trap- 
‘ings were blue, and Beaumains saw him and made him ready 
nd their horses rushed together and they fought two hours and 
ore. And at the last Beaumains smote Sir Persant that he fell 
> the earth. Then Sir Persant yielded him and asked mercy. 
Vith that eame the damsel and prayed to save his life. 
“I will gladly,” said Beaumains, “for it were pity this noble 
night should die.” 
“Now this shall I do to please you,” said Sir Persant, “ye 
iall have homage of me and an hundred knights to be always 
t your command.” . i

And so they went to Sir Persant’s pavilion to rest that night. 
And so on the morn the damsel and Sir Beaumains took their 
leave. 
“Fair damsel,” said Sir Persant, “whither are ye leading this 
5 knight?” : 
“Sir,” she said, “this knight is going to rescue my sister, Dame 
Liones, who is besieged in the Castle Perilous.” 
“Ah,” said Sir Persant, “she is besieged by the Red Knight 
of the Red Lands, a man that is without mercy, and men say 
10 that he hath seven men’s strength. He hath been well nigh two 
years at this siege and he prolongeth the time, hoping to have 
Sir Lancelot to do battle with him, or Sir Tristam, or Sir Lamorak, 
or Sir Gawain.” 
“My lord, Sir Persant,” said the damsel, “I require thae ye 
1s will make this gentleman knight before he fight the Red Knight.” 
“T will with all my heart,” said Sir Persant, “if it please him 
to take the order of knighthood from so simple a man as I am.” 
“Sir,” said Beaumains, “I thank you for your goodwill, but the 
noble knight Sir Lancelot made me knight.” 
zo “Ah,” said Sir Persant, “of a more renowned knight might ye 
not be made knight, for of all knights he may be called chief of 
knighthood; and so all the world saith that betwixt three knights 
is knighthood divided, Sir Lancelot, Sir Tristam, and Sir 7 ----~-* 
Therefore, God speed ye well, for if ye conquer the Re: 
23 ye shall be called the fourth of the world.” 
“Sir,” said Beaumains, “I would fain be of good fame °»4 
knighthood and I will tell you both who I am. Truly then 
name is Gareth of Orkney, and King Lot was my father, anc 
mother is King Arthur’s sister, and Sir Gawain is my brother 7°

And yet know not King Arthur nor Sir Gawain who I am.” 
"HOW THE LADY THAT WAS BESIEGED HAD WORD 
FROM HER SISTER 
The lady that was besieged had word of her sister’ 
by the dwarf, and also how the knight had passed all th 
passages.
-P-A-G-E-132
  The Story of Gareth : / 115 
“Dwarf,” said the lady, “I am glad of these things. Go thou 
unto my sister and greet her well and commend me unto that 
» gentle knight and pray him to eat and to drink and make him 
strong, and say ye that I thank him for his courtesy and good- 
3 ness.” 
So the dwarf departed and told Sir Beaumains all as ye have 
heard and returned to the castle again. And there met him the 
Red Knight of the Red Lands and asked him where he had 
been. 
fj “Sir,” said the dwarf, “I have been with my lady’s sister of 
| this castle, and she hath been at King Arthur’s court and brought 
| a knight with her.” 
1 “Then I count her labor but iost, for though she had brought 
with her Sir Lancelot, Sir Tristam, Sir Lamorak, or Sir Gawain, 
15 I would think myself good enough for them all.” 
“Tt may well be,” said the dwarf, “but this knight hath passed 
all the perilous passages and slain the Black Knight and’won the 
Green Knight, the Red Knight, and the Blue Knight.” 
“Then is he one of the four that I have named.” 
“He is none of those,” said the dwarf. 
“What is his name?” said the Red Knight. 
“That will I not tell you,” said the dwarf. 
“T care not,” said the Red Knight, “what knight soever he 
be, he shall have a shameful death as many others have had.” 
: I And then Beaumains and the damsel came to a plain and saw 
many tents and a fair castle and there was much smoke and great 
} noise and as they came near they saw upon great trees there 
» hung nigh forty goodly armed knights. 
“Fair sir,” said the damsel, “all these knights came to this 
| 30 siege to rescue my sister, and when the Red Knight of the Red 
Lands had overcome them, he put them to this shameful death 
| without mercy or pity.” 
“Truly,” said Beaumains, “he useth shameful customs and it 
is marvel that none of the noble knights of my lord Arthur have 
% dealt with him.” 
And there was near by a sycamore tree and there hung a horn 
and this Red Knight had hanged it up there, that if there came 
eee
-P-A-G-E-133
  116 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
any errant knight he must blow that horn and then he would make 
him ready and come to him to do battle. 
“Sir, I pray you,” said the damsel, “blow ye not the horn till 
it be high noon, for his strength increaseth until noon, and at this 
5 time men say he hath seven men’s strength.” 
“Ah, for shame, fair damsel, say ye so never more to me, for 
I will win honorably, or die knightly in the field.” 
Therewith he blew the horn so eagerly that the castle rang _ 
with the sound. 
10 Then the Red Knight armed him hastily and all was blood red, 
his armor, spear, and shield. 
“Sir,” said the damsel, “yonder is your deadly enemy and at 
yonder window is my sister.” 
With that the Red Knight of the Red Lands called to Sir 
15 Beaumains, “Sir knight, I warn thee that for this lady I have done 
many strong battles.” 
“Tf thou have so done,” said Beaumains, “it was but waste 
labor, and know, thou Red Knight of the Red Lands, I will rescue 
her or die.” 
20 Then Sir Beaumains bade the damsel go from him, and then 
they put their spears in their rests and came together with all 
their might. 
Then they fought till it was past noon and when they had 
rested a while they returned to the battle till evening, but at last 
28 Sir Beaumains smote the sword out of the Red Knight’s hand and 
smote him on the helmet, so that he fell to the earth. 
Then the Red Knight said in a loud voice, “O. noble knight, I 
yield me to thy mercy.” 
But Sir Beaumains said, “I may not with honor save thy life, 
se for the shameful deaths thou hast caused many good knights 
te die.” 
“Sir,” said the Red Knight, “hold your hand and ye shall 
know the causes why I put them to so shameful a death. 
“Say on,” said Sir Beaumains. 
85 “Sir, a lady prayed me that I would make her a promise by 
the faith of my knighthood that I would labor daily in arms, until 
T met Sir Lancelot or Sir Gawain, who, she said, had slain her

  brother, and this is the cause that I have put all these knights 
to death. And now I will tell thee that every day my strength 
increaseth till noon and all this time have I seven men’s strength.” 
Then there came many earls and barons and noble knights 
s and prayed Sir Beaumains to save his life. 
“Sir,” they said, “it were fairer to take homage and let him 
hold his lands of you than to slay him; by his death ye shall have 
no advantage, and his misdeeds that be done may not be undone, 
and therefore he shall make amends to all parties and we all will 
© become your men and do you homage.” 
“Fair lords,” said Beaumains, “I am loath to slay this knight; 
nevertheless he hath done shamefully, but insomuch all that he 
did was at a lady’s request, I will release him upon this condition, 
*hat he go within the castle and yield him to the lady, and if she 
‘ill forgive him, I will. And also when that is done, that ye go . 
ato the court of King Arthur and there that you ask Sir Lancelot 
iercy and Sir Gawain, for the evil will ye have had against 
gem.” 
“Sir,” said the Red Knight, “all this will I do as ye command.” 
And so within a while the Red Knight went into the castle 
nd promised to make amends for all that had been done against 
ae lady. And then he departed unto the court of King Arthur 
and told openly how he was overcome and by whom. 
[ Then said King Arthur and Sir Gawain, “We marvel much 
of what blood he is come, for he is a noble knight.” 
“He is come of full noble blood,” said Sir Lancelot, “and as 
for his might and hardiness, there be but few now living so 
i. mighty as he is.”   
HOW AT THE FEAST OF PENTECOST ALL THE KNIGHTS THAT SIR 
GARETH HAD OVERCOME CAME AND YIELDED 
| . THEM TO KING ARTHUR 
  So leave we Sir Beaumains and turn we unto King Arthur, 
that at the next feast of Pentecost held his feast, and there came 
the Green Knight with thirty knights and yielded them all unto 
King Arthur. And so there came the Red Knight, his brother, 
and yielded him unto King Arthur and threescore knights with

him. Also there came the Blue Knight, brother to them, with an 
hundred knights and yielded them unto King Arthur. 
These three brethren told King Arthur how they were over- 
come by a knight that a damsel had with her and called him 
5 Beaumains. 
“TI wonder,” said the King, “what knight he is and of what 
lineage he is come.” 
So, right as the King stood talking with these thre: 
there came Sir Lancelot and told the King that there w_. -.__. .. 
w goodly lord and six hundred knights with him. 
Then this lord saluted the King. 
“Sir,” he said, “my name is the Red Knight of the Re: 
and here I am sent by a knight that is called Beaumain 
won me in battle hand for hand.” 
b “Ye are welcome,” said the King, “for ye have Jong been 
great foe to me and my court and now I trust to God I shall sc 
treat you that ye shall be my friend.” 
“Sir, both I and these knights shall always be at your summon: 
to do you service.” 
20 “Then I shall make thee a knight of the Table Round, 
thou must be no more a murderer.” 
“Sir, as to that, I have promised Sir Beaumains never mor 
to use such customs and I must go unto Sir Lancelot and to Si 
Gawain and ask them forgiveness of the evil will I had unt 
25 them.” 
“They be here now,” said the King, “before thee; now may 
ye say to them what ye will.” 
And then he kneeled down unto Sir Lancelot and Si 
and prayed for forgiveness for the enmity that he ha 
30 them, 
HOW THE QUEEN OF ORKNEY CAME TC [HE FEAST 
So then they went to meat, and as they sat at the m 
came in the Queen of Orkney with ladies and knights:

arose and went to her and saluted her upon their knees « 
as her blessing, for in fifteen years they had not seen her.

The Story of. Gareth "19   
Then she spake to her brother, King Arthur, ‘Where is my 
young son, Sir Gareth? He was here a twelvemonth,: and. ye 
+ made a kitchen boy of him, which is shame to you all. Alas, 
| where is my dear son that was my joy and my bliss?” 
s “QO dear mother,” said Sir Gawain, “I knew him not.” “Nor 
I,” said the King, “but thank God he is proved an honorable 
knight as any now living of his years, and I shall never be glad 
until I find him.” 
“Ah, brother,” said the Queen, “ye did yourself great shame 
1 when you kept my son in the kitchen.” 
“Fair sister,” said the King, “{ knew him not, nor did Sir 
Gawain, Also, sister, ye might have told me of his coming and 
then, if I had not done well to him, ye might have blamed me. 
| For when he came to my court, he asked me three gifts and one 
“ashe asked the same day; that was, that I would give him meat 
| enough for that twelvemonth, and the other two gifts he asked 
, 
    that day a twelvemonth and that was that he might have the 
adventure for the damsel, and the third was that Sir Lancelot 
should make him knight when he desired him. And so I granted 
20 him all his desire.” 
“Sir,” said the Queen, “I sent him to you well armed and 
horsed and gold and silver plenty to spend.” : 
: “Tt may be,” said the King, “but thereof saw we none, save 
>| the day he departed from us, knights told me that there came 
%a dwarf hither suddenly and brought him armor and a good 
horse, and thereat we all had marvel from whence those riches 
came.” 
“Brother,” said the Queen, “all that ye say I believe, but I 
marvel that Sir Kay did mock and scorn him and gave him that 
30 name Beaumains.” 
“By the grace of God,” said Arthur, “he shall be found, so let 
all this pass and be merry, for he is proved to be a man of honor 
ef and that is my joy.” 
it Then said Sir Gawain and his brethren to Arthur, “Sir, if ye

“That is well said of you,” said the King. 
So the messenger was sent forth and night and day he went

with her brother and Sir Gareth. When she understood the mes- 
sage she went to her brother and Sir Gareth and told them how 
King Arthur had sent for her. 
“That is because of me,” said Sir Gareth. “I pray you do 
10 not let them know where Iam. I know my mother is there and 
all my brethren and they will take upon them to seek me.” 
So the lady departed and came to King Arthur, where she

“Ye have well done,” said Sir Gareth, “but you

So the proclamation was made in England, Wales

The Story of Gareth : 121 
  Ireland, and in Brittany, that men should come to the Castle’ 
Perilous and all the knights should have the choice whether to be 
on the one party with the knights of the castle or on the other 
{ party with King Arthur. And so there came many good knights 
ls and chose to be on the side of the castle and against King Arthur 
and his knights. 
HOw KING ARTHUR WENT TO THE TOURNAMENT 
And there came with King Arthur many kings, princes, earls, 
barons, and other noble knights. Then Sir Gareth prayed Dame 
| and the Red Knight and Sir Persant that none should tell 
his name and that they should make no more of him than of the 
least knight that was there. 
| Upon the day of the tournament the heralds sounded the 
‘trumpets to: call the knights to the field. After many noble 
knights had encountered, Sir Gareth came upon the field. All the 
knights that encountered him were overthrown. 
“That knight is a good knight,” said King Arthur. 
Wherefore the King called unto him Sir Lancelot and prayed 
him to encounter with that knight. 
“Sir,” said Lancelot, “when a good knight doth so well upon 
some day, it is no good knight’s part to prevent him from receiv- 
ing honor, and therefore, as for me, this day he shall have the 
honor; though it lay in my power to hinder him, I would not.” 
Then betwixt many knights there was strong battle, and mar- 
velous deeds of arms were done. And two knights, who were 
brothers, assailed Sir Lancelot at once and he, as the noblest 
Xnight of the world, fought with them both, so that all men won- 
dered at the nobility of Sir Lancelot. And then came in Sir 
Gareth and knew that it was Sir Lancelot that fought with the 
two strong knights. So Sir Gareth came with his good horse and 
hurled them apart and no stroke would he smite to Sir Lancelot. 
Sir Lancelot saw this and thought it must be the good Knight 
Sir Gareth and Sir Gareth rode here and there and smote on the 
Night hand and on the left hand, so that all men said he best did 
his duty. . 
“Now go,” said King Arthur unto the heralds, “and ride about

‘him and see what manner of knight he is, for I have inquired o 
many knights this day that be of his party and all say they knov 
him not.” 
And so a herald rode as near Sir Gareth as he could 
s he saw written upon his helmet in gold, “Sir Gareth o: 
Then the herald cried and many heralds with him, “ 
Gareth of Orkney.” Then all the kings and knights pressed t 
behold him and ever the heralds cried, “This is Sir Gareth « 
Orkney, King Lot’s son.” 
10 When Sir Gareth saw that he was known, then he doubled h 
strokes and with great difficulty made his way out of the crow 
and rode into the forest. And then fell there a thunder and ra 
as though heaven and earth should go together. 
Sir Gareth was not a little weary, for all that day he had bi 
is little rest, neither his horse nor he, and he rode in the forest. un 
night came. And ever it lightened and thundered but at last | 
fortune he came to a castle. 
HOW SIR GARETH CAME TO A CASTLE WHERE 
HE WAS WELL LODGED 
Then Sir Gareth rode into the courtyard of the castle a 
prayed the porter to let him in. The porter answered, “Th 
20 gettest no lodging here.” 
“Fair sir, say not so, for I am a knight of King Arthur’s, 
pray the lord or the lady of this castle to give me lodging for 
love of King Arthur.” 
Then the porter went unto the lady and told her there wal 
2s knight of King Arthur’s would have lodging. 
“Let him enter,” said the lady, “for King Arthur’s ~~" *° 
Then she went up into a tower over the gate with ; 
light. When Sir Gareth saw the light he cried aloud 
thou be lord or lady, giant or champion, I care not, so 
so have lodging this night; and if it so be that I must 
me not tomorrow when I have rested, for both I and wu. 4,

“Sir Knight,” said the lady, “thou speakest knightly

Then made Sir Lancelot great cheer of Sir Gareth and he of

THE PEERLESS KNIGHT LANCELOT 
THE TOURNAMENT AT WINCHESTER 
King Arthur proclaimed a great joust and a tournse 
should be held at Camelot, that is Winchester; and the 
that he and the King of Scots would joust against all t 
come against them. And when this proclamation 1 
s thither came many knights, 
So King Arthur made him ready to depart to th: 
but Sir Lancelot would not ride with the King, for | 
was suffering from a grievous wound. And so the Kin; 
toward Winchester with his fellowship and by the way | 
ie in 4 town called Astolat. 
And upon the morn early Sir Lancelot departed and rode unti 
he came to Astolat and there it happened in the evening: ~ 
to the castle of an old baron, who was called Sir 
of Astolat. As Sir Lancelot entered into his lodging, Kiug a:uuiu 
a5 saw him and knew him full well. 
“Tt is well,” said King Arthur unto the knights that were witl 
him. “I have now seen one knight that will play his play at th 
jousts to which we are going. I undertake he will .do grea 
marvels.” 
20 = =©“Who is that, we pray you tell us?” said many knight: 
were there at that time. 
“Ye shall not know from me,” said the King, “at this time. 
And so the King smiled and went to his lodging. 
So when Sir Lancelot was in his lodging and unarmed him } 
a his chamber, the old baron came to him and welcomed him in tl 
best manner, but the old knight knew not Sir Lancelot. 
“Fair sir,” said Sir Lancelot to’ his host, “I would pra: 
to lend me a shield that were not openly known, for mine i: 
known.” 
so © “Sir,” said his host, “ye shall have your desire for meseeme! 
ye be one of the likeliest knights of the world and therefore I shz

  show you friendship. Sir, I have two sons that were but late made 
knights and the elder is called Sir Torre and he was hurt that same 
day he was made knight, that he may not ride and his shield y’ 
shall have, for that is not known, I dare say, but here, and in no 
splace else. And my younger son is called Lavaine and if it please 
you, he shall ride with you unto the jousts and he is of age and 
strong and brave; for much my heart giveth unto you that ye be 
a noble knight. Therefore, I pray you tell me your name,” said 
Sir Bernard. 
19 “As for that,” said Sir Lancelot, “ye must hold me excused at 
this time and if God give me grace to speed well at the jousts, I 
shall come again and tell you. But, I pray you, in any wise, let © 
me have your son, Sir Lavaine, with me and that I may have his 
| brother's shield.” 
“AN this shall be done,” said Sir Bernard. 
This old baron had a daughter that was called at that time 
ie fair maiden of Astolat and her name was Elaine. So this 
aiden besought Sir Lancelot to wear upon him at the jousts a 
ken of hers. 
“Fair damsel,” said Sir Lancelot, “if I grant you that, I will 
» more for you than ever I did for lady.” 
Then he remembered him he would go to the jousts disguised. 
nd because he had never before that time borne the token of any 
| lady, then he bethought him that he would wear one of hers, that 
snone of his blood thereby might know him. And then he said, 
air maiden, I will grant you to wear a token of yours upon mine 
(met and therefore what it is, show it me.” 
“Sir,” she said, “it is a sleeve of mine, of scarlet, well em- 
sidered with great pearls.” 
And so she brought it him. So Sir Lancelot received it ana 
ve the maiden his shield in keeping, and he prayed her to keep 
at until he came again. 
So upon a day, on the morn, King Arthur and all his knights 
parted, for the King had tarried three days to abide his noble 
lights. And so when the King had gone, Sir Lancelot ‘and Sir 
avaine made them ready to ride and either of them had white 
‘elds, and the red sleeve Sir Lancelot carried with him. So they

took their leave of Sir Bernard, the old baron, and of his daughter 
the fair maiden of Astolat. 
And then they rode till they came to Camelot and there wat 
a great press of kings, dukes, earls, and barons and many noble 
s knights. But there Sir Lancelot was lodged by means of Sir 
Lavaine with a rich burgess so that no man in that town knew who 
they were. And so they reposed them there, till the day of the 
tournament. : 
So the trumpets blew unto the field and King Arthur was set 
10 on a high place to behold who did best. Then some of the kings 
were that time turned upon the side of King Arthur. And then 
on the other party were the King of Northgalis and the King of 
the Hundred Knights and the King of Northumberland and Sir 
Galahad, the noble prince. But these three kings and this duke 
15 were passing weak to hold against King Arthur’s party, for with 
him were the noblest knights of the world. 
So then they withdrew them, cither party from oth 
every man made him ready in his best manner to do | 
might. Then Sir Lancelot made him ready and put the re 
z0 upon his head and fastened it fast; and so Sir Lancelot 
Lavaine departed out of Winchester and rode into a littl: 
wood behind the party that held against King Arthur’s pa.cy , au 
there they held them still till the parties smote together. 
And then came in the King of Scots andthe Kiny *" * 7 > 
26 Arthur’s party and against them came the King o| 
land, and the King with the Hundred Knights sti 
King of Ireland. So there began a strong assail upc 
And there came in together many knights of the

When Sir Lancelot saw this, he said unto Sir Lave 
yonder is a company of good knights and they hold ther: 
as boars that were chased with dogs.” 
“That is truth,” said Sir Lavaine. 
3s “Now,” said Sir Lancelot, “if ye will help me a little, y: | 
see yonder fellowship that chaseth now these men on our sid) | 
they shall go as fast backward as they went forward.”
-P-A-G-E-146
  The Peerless Knight Lancelot 129 
  “Sir, spare not,” said Sir Lavaine, “for I shall do what I may.” 
Then Sir Lancelot and Sir Lavaine came in at the thickest of 
the press and there Sir Lancelot smote down five knights and all 
this he did with one spear; and Sir Lavaine smote down twe. 
s knights. And then Sir Lancelot got another spear and there he 
smote down four knights and Sir Lavaine smote one. 
And then Sir Lancelot drew his sword and there he smote on the- 
right hand and on the left hand and by great’ force he unhorsed 
aree knights; and then the knights of the Table Round withdrew 
hem back, after they had gotten their. horses as well as they 
light. 
“Oh,” said Sir Gawain, “what knight is yonder that doth such: 
marvelous deeds of arms in that field?” 
“TI know well who he is,” said King Arthur, “but at this time 
23 1 will not name him.” 
“Sir,” said Sir Gawain, “I would say it were Sir Lancelot by 
his riding and the blows I see him deal, but ever meseemeth it. 
should not be he, for that he beareth the red sleeve upon his head,, 
for I know he never wore token of lady at a joust.” 
20 «= “Let him be,” said King Arthur; “he will be better known and’ 
do more, or ever he depart.” 
Then the party that was against King Arthur was well com-- 
forted and then they held them together that beforehand were sore- 
| pressed. So nine knights of Lancelot’s kin thrust in mightily, for: 
*5 they were all noble knights; and they, of great hate that they 
had unto him, thought to rebuke that noble knight, Sir Lancelot, 
and Sit Lavaine, for they knew them not. And so they came 
charging together and smote down many knights of Northgaliz 
and Northumberland. 
And when Sir Lancelot saw them fare so, he took a spear in his 
hand and there encountered with him all at once, Sir Bors, Sir- 
Ector, and Sir Lionel, and all they three smote him at once with 
their spears. 
And with force of themselves they smote Sir Lancelot’s horse: 
to the earth and by misfortune Sir Bors smote Sir Lancelot: 
through the shield into the side and the spear broke and'the head: 
Fas left in his side.  
-P-A-G-E-147
  
130 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
  When Sir Lavaine saw his master lie on the ground, he ran 
to the King of Seots and smote him to the earth; and by great 
force he took his horse and brought it to Sir Lancelot, and in 
spite of them all he made him to mount upon that horse. And 
6 then Sir Lancelot took a spear in his hand and there he smote Sir 
Bors, horse and man, to the earth. In the same wise he served Sir 
Ector and Sir Lionel. 
And then Sir Lancelot drew his sword, for he felt himself so 
sore and hurt that he thought there to have had his death. And 
10 he smote down three knights more, but by this was Sir Bors horsed 
and then he came with Sir Ector and Sir Lionel and all they three 
smote with swords upon Sir Lancelot’s helmet. And when he felt 
their buffets and his wound, which was so grievous, then he 
thought to do what he might, while he might endure. 
1s And then he gave Sir Bors such a buffet that he made him bow 
his head passing low; and therewith he smote off his helmet and 
might have slain him; and so pulled him down, and in the same 
wise he served Sir Ector and Sir Lionel. For he might have slain 
them, but when he saw their faces his heart might not serve him 
20 thereto, but left them there. 
And so afterward he hurled into the thickest press of them all 
and did there the most marvelous deeds of arms that ever man 
saw or heard speak of, and ever Sir Lavaine, the good knight, with 
him. And there Sir Lancelot with his sword smote down ~~?) 
25 pulled down more than thirty knights and the most part we 
the Table Round; and Sir Lavaine did full well that day, f 
smote down ten knights of the Table Round. 
“J marvel,” said Sir Gawain, “what knight that is with th 
sleeve.” 
30 “Sir,” said King Arthur, “he will be known before he de- 
part.” 
And then the trumpets blew and the prize was given b 
unto the knight with the white shield that bore the re 
Then came the King with the Hundred Knights, the 
35 Northgalis and the King of Northumberland and Sir Gal 
noble prince, and said unto Sir Lancelot, “Fair knight, 
bless, for much have you done this day for us; therefore, . re pag

you that ye will come with us, that ye may receive the honor and 
the prize, as ye have honorably deserved it.” , 
“My fair lords,” said Sir Lancelot, “if I have deserved thanks, 
Ihave sore bought it; and that me repenteth, for I am like never 
3 to escape with my life; therefore, fair lords, I pray you that ye 
will suffer me to depart where me liketh, for I am sore hurt. I care 
for no honor, for I would more gladly repose me than to be lord 
of all the world.” 
_And therewithal he groaned piteously and rode away from 
10 them until he came to a wood. And when he saw that he was from 
the field nigh a mile, that he was sure he might not be seen, then 
he said, “O gentle knight, Sir Lavaine, help me that this spear 
ere out of my side, for it slayeth me.’ 
“O mine own lord,” said Sir Lavaine, “I would fain do that 
light please you, but I dread me sore, if I pull out the spear, that 
e shall be in peril of death.” / 
“T charge you,” said Sir Lancelot, “as ye love me, draw it out.” 
And therewithal he descended from his horse and right so did 
ir Lavaine; and forthwith Sir Lavaine drew the spear out of his 
de and he gave a great shriek and so swoonéd, pale and deadly. 
“Alas,” said Sir Lavaine, “what shall I do?” 
And so at the last Sir Lancelot cast up his eyes and said, 
0 Lavaine, help me that I were on my horse, for here is fast by 
[vith this two miles a gentle hermit, that sometime was a full 
5 noble knight and a great lord of possessions. And for great good- 
ness he hath taken him to poverty and his name is Sir Baudwin of 
Brittany and he is a full noble surgeon. Now let see, help me up 
that I were there, for ever my heart telleth me that I shall never 
die of my cousin’s hands.” 
And then with great pain Sir Lavaine helped him upon his 
horse. And then they rode together and so by fortune they came 
to that hermitage, the which was in a wood and a great cliff on 
the other side and fair water running under it. And Sir Lavaine 
beat on the gate and there came a fair child to them and asked 
8 them what they would. 
“Fair son,” said Sir Lavaine, “go and pray thy lord, the her- 
mit, to let in here a knight that is full sore wounded; and this
-P-A-G-E-149
  
132 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
day, tell thy lord, I saw him do more deeds of arms than ever I 
heard say that any man did.” 
So the child went in lightly and then he brought the hermit, 
the which was a passing good man. When Sir Lavaine saw him, 
s he prayed him for succor. 
“What knight is he?” said the hermit. “Is he of the house of 
Arthur or not?” 
"TI know not,” said Sir Lavaine, “what is he or what is his 
name, but well I know I saw him do marvelously this day, as of 
10 deeds of arms.” , 
“On whose party was he?” said the hermit. 
“Sir,” said Lavaine, “he was this day against King >the 
and there he won the prize from all the knights of the 
Table.” — 
1s “T have seen the day,” said the hermit, “I would have leved 
him the worse because he was against my lord, King Art 
sometime I was one of the fellowship of the Round Tab. 
thank God, now I am otherwise disposed. But where 
Let me see him.” 
zo And when the hermit beheld him, he thought that h | 
know him, but he could not bring him to knowledge bec 
was so pale. 
“What knight are ye?” said the hermit. 
“My fair lord,” said Lancelot, “I am a stranger and | 
25 adventurous, that laboreth throughout many realms for 
honor.” 
Then the hermit saw by a wound on his cheek that he w: 
Sir Lancelot. 
“Alas,” said the hermit, “mine own lord, why conceal y: 
30 your name from me? Forsooth, I ought to know you of rig 
for ye are the noblest knight of the world, for well I know y 
for Sir Lancelot.” 
“Sir,” said he, “since ye know me, help me if ye can, 
I would be out of this pain at once, either to death or 
35 life.” 
“Have ye no doubt,” said the hermit, “ye shall live and f, 
right well.”
-P-A-G-E-150

— 
And so the hermit called to him two of his servants and they 
bore him into the hermitage and lightly unarmed him and laid him 
in his bed. And then anon the hermit stanched his blood and soon 
Sir Lancelot was well refreshed and knew himself. 
s Now turn we unto King Arthur and leave we Sir Lancelot in 
the hermitage. So when the kings were come together on both 
parties and the great feast should be held, King Arthur asked 
the King of Northgalis and their fellowship, where was that 
knight that bore the red sleeve. , 
w “Bring him before me, that he may have his praise and honor 
and the prize as it is right.” 
Then spake Sir Galahad, the noble prince, “We suppose that 
knight is injured and that he is never like to see you nor any of 
us all, and that is the greatest pity that ever we knew of any 
45 knight.” 
“Alas,” said Arthur, “how may this be? Is he so hurt? What 
is his name?” 
“Truly,” said they all, “we know not his name, nor from. 
_ whence he came nor whither he went.” 
0 “Alas,” said the King, “this be to me the worst tidings that ~ 
came to me this seven year, for I would not for all the lands I 
possess to know that that noble knight were slain.” 
“Know ye him?” said they all. 
“As for that,” said Arthur, “whether I know him or not, ye 
% shall not know from me what man he is, but God send me good 
tidings of him.” 
“Tf it so be that the good knight be so sore hurt,” said Sir 
‘ain, “it is great damage and pity to all this land, for he is 
of the noblest knights that ever I saw in a field handle a spear 
sword; and if he may be found, I shall find him, for I am sure 
snot far from this town.” 
Light so Sir Gawain took a squire with him and rode all about 
ielot within six or seven miles, but so he came again and could 
no word of him. Then within two days King Arthur and all 
fellowship returned unto London again. 
ind so as they rode by the way, it happened that Sir Gawain 
ed with Sir Bernard where was Sir Lancelot lodged. And Sir 
   
-P-A-G-E-151
  134 - Junior High School Literature, Book One   
Bernard and his daughter, Elaine, came to him to cheer him and 
to ask him who did best at that tournament. 
“There were two knights,” said Sir Gawain, “that bore two 
white shields, but one of them bore a red sleeve upon his head 
s and certainly he was one of the best knights that ever I saw joust 
in field. For I dare say, that one knight with the red sleeve 
down forty knights of the Table Round and his fellow did 
well and honorably.” 
“Now I thank God,” said Elaine, “that that knight sped so 
10 well.” 
“Know ye his name?” said Sir Gawain. 
“Nay, truly,” said the maiden, “I know not his name, nor 
whence he cometh.” 
“Tell me, then, how had ye knowledge of him first?” said Sir 
18 Gawain. 
Then she told him as ye have heard before, and how hei 
intrusted her brother to him to do him service and how he 
lent him her brother’s.shield, “And here with me he left his vu, 
she said. 
zo “For what cause did he so?” said Sir Gawain. 
“For this cause,” said the damsel, “for his shield was to. 
known among many noble knights. 
“Ah, fair damsel,” said Sir Gawain, “please it you let me hav 
a sight of that shield.” 
25 So when the shield was come, Sir Gawain knew it was S' 
Lancelot’s shield. 
“Ah,” said Sir Gawain, “now is my heart heavier than ever 
was before.” 
“Why?” said Elaine. 
30 “T have great cause,” said Sir Gawain; “the knight that owne 
this shield is the most honorable knight of the world.” 
“So I thought ever,” said Elaine. 
“But I dread me,” said Sir Gawain, “that ye shall never g 
him in this world and that is the greatest pity that ever was 
3s earthly knight.” 
“Alas,” said she, “how may this be? Is he slain?” 
“IT say not so,” said Sir Gawain, “but he is grievously woun
-P-A-G-E-152
The Peerless Knight Lancelot ™ 135 
nen re 
and more likely to be dead than to be alive and he is the noble 
knight, Sir Lancelot, for by this shield I know him.” 
“Alas,” said Elaine, “how may this be and what was. his 
| hurt?” 
s “Truly,” said Sir Gawain, “the man in the world that loved 
him best, hurt him so, and I dare say, if that knight that hurt” 
| him knew that he had hurt Sir Lancelot, it would be the most 
| sorrow that ever came to his heart.” 
“Now, fair father,” said Elaine, “I require you give me leave 
to ride and to seek him and my brother, Sir Lavaine.” 
“Do as it liketh you,” said her father, “for me sore repenteth 
' of the hurt of that noble knight.” 
Then on the morn Sir Gawain came to King Arthur and told 
him how he had found Sir Lancelot’s shield in the keeping of the 
5 fair maiden of Astolat. . 
“All that I knew beforehand,” said King Arthur, “for I saw 
him when he came to his lodging full late in the evening, in 
Astolat.” 
So the King and all came to London and there Sir Gawain 
openly disclosed to all the Court, that it was Sir Lancelot that 
jousted best. 
{And when Sir Bors heard that, he was a sorrowful man and so 
were all his kinsmen. And Sir Bors said, “I will haste me to seek 
| him and find him wheresoever he be and God send me good tidings 
of him.”

sick and pale she said, “My lord Sir Lancelot, alas, why be ye in

But Sir Lancelot said, “Fair maiden, if ye be come to ~*~"

Then the fair maiden told him all, how Sir Gawain wai

So Elaine watched Sir Lancelot and cared for his wound ant 
10 did such attendance to him that the story saith that never mai 
had a kindlier nurse. Then Sir Lancelot prayed Sir Lavaine t 
make inquiries in Winchester for Sir Bors and told him by wha 
tokens he should know him, by a wound in his forehead. 
“For well I am sure that Sir Bors will seek me,” said Si 
w Lancelot, “for he is the same good knight that hurt me.” 
Now turn we to Sir Bors that came unto Winches’ 
after his cousin Sir Lancelot. And so when he came ti 
ter, anon there were men that Sir Lavaine had made te «uw a 
such a man and anon Sir Lavaine had warning; and the: 
20 Lavaine came to Winchester and found Sir Bors and there h: 
him who he was and with whom he was and what was his 1 
“Now, fair knight,” said Sir Bors, “I require you that y: 
bring me to my lord, Sir Lancelot.” 
“Sir,” said Sir Lavaine, “take your horse and within this ho 
25 ye shall see him.” 
And so they departed and came to the hermitage. An 
Sir Bors saw Sir Lancelot lie in his bed, pale and discolore: 
Sir Bors lost his countenance and for kindness and pity h 
not speak but wept tenderly for a great while. 
30 And then, when he might speak, he said thus, “O mr 
Sir Lancelot, God you-bless, and send you hasty recover, , a 
full heavy am I of my misfortune and mine unhappirss= f-~ ~; 
I may call myself unhappy. And I dread me that G | 
displeased with me, that He would suffer me to have : |

call myself unhappy. Alas, that ever such a miserab 
Tam, should have power by unhappiness to hurt the n:

  of the world! Where I so shamefully set upon you and over- 
charged you, and where ye might have slain me, ye saved me; and 
so did not I, for I and your kindred did to you our uttermost. 
I marvel, that my heart or my blood would serve me, wherefore, 
| smy lord Sir Lancelot, I ask your mercy.” 
“Fair cousin,” said Sir Lancelot, “ye be right welcome; and 
much ye say which pleaseth me not, for I have the same I sought; 
for I would with pride have overcome you all, and there in my 
' pride, I was near slain and that was my own fault, for I might 
1ohave given you warning of my being there. And then would I 
have had no hurt; for it is an old saying, there is hard battle when 
kin and friends do battle, either against other, for there may be no 
mercy but mortal war. Therefore, fair cousin, all shall be wel- 
come that God sendeth; and let us leave off this matter and let 
| us speak of some rejoicing, for this that is done may not, be un- 
  done; and let us find a remedy how soon I may be whole.” 
Then Sir Bors leaned upon his bed and told him how Sir 
Gawain knew him by the shield he left with the fair maiden of 
Astolat and so they talked of many more things. And so within 
w three or four days Sir Lancelot was big and strong again. 
Then Sir Bors told Sir Lancelot how there was a great tourna- 
' ment and joust agreed upon between King Arthur and the King 
of Northgalis. 
“Is that the truth?” said Sir Lancelot. “Then shall ye abide 
;° with me still a little while, until that I be whole, for I feel myself 
| right big and strong.” 
Then were they together nigh a month and ever this maiden 
ine did her diligent labor for Sir Lancelot, so that there never 
_a child or wife meeker to her father or husband, than was 
» fair maiden of Astolat; wherefore Sir Bors was greatly 
wed with her. 
3o upon a day, Sir Lancelot thought to try his armor and his 
ar. And so when he was upon his horse, he stirred him fiercely, 
the horse was passing strong and fresh, because he had not 
a labored for a month. And then Sir Lancelot couched that 
win the rest. That courser leaped mightily when he felt the 
ts and he that was upon him, the which was the noblest horse

iia the world, strained him mightily and kept still the spear in the 
wrest. and therewith Sir Lancelot strained himself with so great 
force, to get the horse forward that the wound opened and he felt 
himself so feeble, that he might not sit upon his horse. 
‘s And then Sir Lancelot cried unto Sir Bors, “Ah, Sir Bors and 
Sir Lavaine, help me, for I am come to my end.” And therewith 
he fell down to the earth as if he were dead. : 
And then Sir Bors and Sir Lavaine came to him with sorrow. 
Then came the holy hermit, Sir Baudwin of Brittany, and when 
10 he feund Sir Lancelot in that plight, he said but little, but know 
ye well that he was wroth; and then he bade them, “Let us have 
him in.’ 
And so they all bare him into the hermitage and unarmed him 
and laid him in his bed and evermore his wound bled piteously, but 
15 he stirred no limb. Then the knight hermit put a little water in 
' his mouth and Sir Lancelot waked of his swoon and then the her- 
mit stanched his bleeding. 
And when he might speak he asked Sir Lancelot why he put 
his life in jeopardy. 
20 “Sir,” said Sir Lancelot, “because I thought I had been strong 
and also Sir Bors told me that there should be great jousts betwixt 
King Arthur and the King of Northgalis and therefore I thought 
to try it myself, whether I might be there or not.” 
“Ah, Sir Lancelot,” said the hermit, “your-heart and your cour- 
25 age will never be done, until your last day, but ye shall do now 
by my counsel. Let Sir Bors depart from you and let him do at 
that tournament what he may. And by the grace of God, by that 
the tournament be done, and ye come hither again, Sir Lancelot 
shall be as whole as ye, if so be that he will be governed by me.” 
so Then Sir Bors made him ready to depart from Sir Lancelot; 
and then Sir Lancelot said, ‘Fair cousin, Sir Bors, recommen 
me unto all them unto whom I ought to recommend me. And 
pray you, exert yourself at the jousts that ye may be best, foi 
my love; and here shall I abide you at the mercy of God till y' 
as come again.” 
And so Sir Bors departed and came to the court of King Arthu 
and told them in what place he had left Sir Lancelot. 
           
       
     
-P-A-G-E-156
  The Peerless Knight Lancelot 139 
“That grieveth me,” said the King, “but since he shall have his 
life we all may thank God.” 
And then every knight of the Round Table that. was there at 
that time present, made him ready to be at the jousts and thither 
| s drew many knights of many countries. And as the time drew 
near, thither came the King of Northgalis, and the King with the 
Hundred Knights and Sir Galahad, the noble prince, and thither 
came the King of Ireland and the King of Scots. So these three 
kings came on King Arthur’s party. 
t0 And that day Sir Gawain did great deeds of arms and began 
first. And the heralds numbered that Sir Gawain smote down 
twenty knights. Then Sir Bors came in the same time, and he 
| was numbered that he smote down twenty knights and therefore 
  the prize was given betwixt them both, for they began first and 
'5 longest endured. 
Also Sir Gareth did that day great deeds of arms, for he smote 
down and pulled down thirty knights. But when he had done 
these deeds he tarried not, but so departed, and therefore he lost 
his prize. And Sir Palomides did great deeds of arms that day 
» for he smote down twenty knights, but he departed suddenly, and 
men thought Sir Gareth and he rode together to some adventures. 
So when this tournament was done, Sir Bors departed, and 
rode till he came to Sir Lancelot, his cousin; and then he found 
him on his feet and there cither made great joy of other; arid so 
+ Sir Bors told Sir Lancelot of all the jousts, like as ye have heard. 
“T marvel,” said Sir Lancelot, “at Sir. Gareth when he had 
done such deeds of arms, that he would not tarry.” 
} “Thereof we marvel all,” said Sir Bors, “for except you, or 
Sir Tristam, or Sir Lamorak, I saw never knight bear down so 
many in so little a while, as did Sir Gareth, and anon he was 
gone, we knew not where.” 
“By-my head,” said Sir Lancelot, “he is a noble knight and a 
mighty man and well breathed; and if he were well tried, I would 
think he were good enough for any knight that beareth the life; 
sand he is a gentle knight, courteous, true, bounteous, meek, and 
‘aild, and'in him is no manner of evil, but he is plain, faithful, 
and true.”

So then they made them ready to depart from the hermit. And 
so upon a morn, they took their horses and Elaine with them and 
when they came to Astolat, they were well lodged and had great \ 
cheer of Sir Bernard, the old baron, and of Sir Torre, his son. 
s And upon the morrow, Sir Lancelot took his leave and came unto 
Winchester. 
And when King Arthur knew that Sir Lancelot was come whole 
and sound the King made great joy of him, and so did Sir Gawain 
and all the knights except Sir Agravaine and Sir Modred. i 
THE DEATH OF ELAINE 
10 Now speak we of the fair maiden of Astolat, that made such 
sorrow day and night that she never slept, ate, or drank because 
she grieved so for Sir Lancelot. So when she had thus endured 
ten days, she became so feeble that she knew she must die. 
And then she called her father, Sir Bernard, and her brother. 
15 Sir Torre, and heartily she prayed her father that her brother 
might write a letter as she did tell him, and so her father granted 
her. And when the letter was written, word by word as she said, 
then she prayed her father, saying, “When I am dead, let this 
letter be put in my right hand and my hand bound fast with the 
20 letter, and let me be put in a fair bed with all the richest clothes 
that I have about me, and so let my bed be laid with me in a 
chariot and carried unto the Thames. And there let me be put 
within a barge and but one man with me, such as ye trust to steer 
me thither. And let my barge be covered with black samite over 
2s and over; thus, father, I beseech you let it be done.” 
So her father granted it her faithfully, all things should b 
done as she asked. Then her father and her brother made grea 
sorrow, for they knew she was dying. And so when she was dea 
her body was placed in a barge and a man steered the barge unt, 
30 Westminster, and there he rowed a great while to and fro befor| 
any saw him. 
So by fortune, King Arthur and Queen Guinevere were spea 
ing together at a window and so as they looked out on the Thame 
they saw this black barge and marveled what it meant. -Then t¢ 
as King called Sir Kay and showed it to him.

“Go thither,” said the King to Sir Kay, “and take with you 
Sir Brandiles and Sir Agravaine and bring word what is 
there.” 
Then these knights departed and came to the barge and went 
5 in; and there they found the fair maiden lying in a rich bed, and 
a poor man sitting in the barge’s end and no word would he speak. 
So these knights returned unto the King again and told him what, 
they found. 
And then the King took the Queen by the hand and went 
1 thither. Then the King made the barge to be held fast and then 
the King and Queen entered with certain knights with them, and 
there they saw the fairest maiden in a rich bed, covered with 
many rich clothes and all was cloth of gold, and she lay as though 
she smiled. . 
» 15 Then the Queen saw a letter in her right hand and told the 
King. Then the King took it and said, “Now I am sure this letter 
will tell what she was and why she is come hither.” 
So then the King and the Queen went out of the barge, and so 
when the King was come within his chamber, he called many 
20 knights about him, and said he would know openly what was 
written within that letter. Then the King opened it and made a 
~ clerk read it, and this was the letter: 
} ‘Most noble knight, Sir Lancelot, I was called the Fair Maiden 
/ of Astolat. Pray for my soul and give me burial at least. This 
} % is my last request. Pray for my soul, Sir Lancelot, as thou art 
a peerless knight.” 
{ This was all the substance of the letter. And when it was 
} read, the King, the Queen, and all the knights wept for pity. Then 
\. was Sir Lancelot sent for; and when he was come King Arthur 
30 made the letter to be read to him. 
\ And when Sir Lancelot heard it word by word, he said, “My 
lord, King Arthur, I am right sorrowful because of the death of 
this fair damsel. She was both fair and good and much was I 
indebted to her for her care. I offered her for her kindness that 
% she showed me, a thousand pounds yearly, whensoever she would 
wed some good knight, and always while I live to be her.own 
knight.”

Then said the King unto Sir Lancelot, “It will be to your honor 
that ye see that she be buried honorably.” 
“Sir,” said Sir Lancelot, “that shall be done as I can best do it.” 
And so upon the morn she was buried richly, and all the 
5 knights of the Round Table were there with Sir Lancelot. And 
then the poor man went again with the barge. 
THE TOURNAMENT AT WESTMINSTER 
So time passed on till Christmas and then every day there 
were jousts made for a diamond, who that jousted best should 
have a diamond. But Sir Lancelot would not joust, but if it were 
to ata great joust. But Sir Lavaine jousted there passing well and 
best was praised, for there were but few that did so well. Where- 
fore, all manner of knights thought that Sir Lavaine should be 
made Knight of the Round Table at the next feast of Pentecost. 
So after Christmas, King Arthur called unto him many knights 
1s and there they advised together to make a great tournament, 
And the King of Northgalis said to Arthur that he would have 
on his party the King of Ireland and the King with the Hundred 
Knights and the King of Northumberland and Sir Gala*-7 +" 
noble prince. And so then four kings and this mighty d 
2 part against King Arthur and the Knights of the Tabh 
And the proclamation was made that the jousts shot 
‘Westminster, and so the knights made them ready to t 
jousts in the freshest manner. Then Queen Guinevere 
Sir Lancelot and said thus, “I forbid you that ye ride 
25 or tournaments, unless your kinsmen know you. And 
jousts that be, ye shall have of me a sleeve of gold, and 
you, that ye warn your kinsmen that ye will bear that 
sleeve of gold upon your helmet.” 
“Madam,” said Sir Lancelot, “it shall be done.” 
so And when Sir Lancelot saw his time, he told Sir Bo-~ *+-+ 
would depart and have no one with him but Sir Lavaine 
good hermit that dwelt in the forest of Windsor, ancl 
thought to repose him and take all the rest that he mig’ 
he would be fresh at that day of jousts. 
85 So Sir Launcelot and Sir Lavaine departed, that n

knew where he was gone, but the noble men of his blood. And 
when he was come to the hermitage he had good cheer. And so 
daily Sir Lancelot would go to a well, fast by the hermitage and 
there he would lie down and see the well spring and bubble, and 
s sometimes he slept’ there. 
So when the day was come Sir Lancelot planned that he should 
be arrayed, and Sir Lavaine and their horses, as though they were 
Saracens, and so they departed and came nigh to the field. 
The King of Northgalis brought with him a hundred knights, 
land the King of Northumberland brought with him a hundred 
l good knights, and the King of Ireland brought with him a hundred. 
good knights ready to joust, and Sir Galahad brought with him a. 
hundred good knights, and the King with the Hundred Knights 
brought with him as many, and all these were proved good 
1s knights. 
| Then came in King Arthur’s party, and there came in the 
King of Scots with a hundred knights, and King Uriens brought 
with him a hundred knights, and King Howel of Brittany brought 
with him a hundred knights, and King Arthur himself came into 
2 the field with two hundred knights and the most part were knights 
of the Table Round, that were proved noble knights, and there 
were old knights set in a high place, to judge with the Queen who . 
did best. 
Then the heralds blew the call to the field, and then the King 
%of Northgalis encountered with the King of Scots and then the 
King of Scots had a fall: and the King of Ireland smote down King 
Uriens and the King of Northumberland smote down King Howel 
of Brittany. And then King Arthur was wroth and ran te the 
King with the Hundred Knights and there King Arthur smote him 
down; and after, with that same spear, King Arthur smote down 
three other knights. And when his spear was broken, King Arthur 
did exceedingly well; and so therewith came in Sir Gawain and 
Sir Gaheris, Sir Agravaine and Sir Modred, and there each of 
them smote down a knight, and Sir Gawain smote down four 
13 knights. 
i Then began a strong battle, for there came in the knights of 
| Sir Laneelot’s kindred and Sir Gareth and Sir Palomides with

them, and many knights of the Table Round, and they began to 
press the four kings and the mighty duke so hard that they were 
discomfited; but this Duke Galahad was a noble knight and by 
his mighty prowess he held back the knights of the Table Round. 
8 All this saw Sir Lancelot and then he came into the field with 
Sir Lavaine as if it had been thunder. And then anon Sir Bors 
and the knights of his kindred saw Sir Lancelot, and Sir Bors said 
to them all, “I warn you beware of him with the sleeve of gold 
upon his head, for he is Sir Lancelot himself.” 
tw - And for great goodness Sir Bors warned Sir Gareth. “I am 
well satisfied,” said Sir Gareth, “that I may know him.” “But 
who is he,” said they all, “that rideth with him in the same 
array?” 
“That is the good and gentle knight, Sir ‘Lavaine; ” saicl 
13 Bors, 
So Sir Lancelot encountered with Sir Gawain and ther: 
force Sir Lancelot smote down Sir Gawain and his horse tc 
earth, and so he smote down Sir Agravaine and Sir Gaheris 
also he smote down Sir Modred, and all this was with one spear

then they were horsed again, and then met Sir Lancel 
Palomides and there Sir Palomides had a fall; and so Si 
without stopping, as fast as he might get spears, smote c ' 
2s knights and the most part of them were knights of 
Round; and ever the knights of his kindred withdrew 
in other places where Sir Lancelot came not. 
And then King Arthur was wroth when he saw Lancel!-+ 
such deeds for he knew not that it was Sir Lancelot; an: 
30 the King called unto him nine knights and so the King wit 
knights made ready to set upon Sir Lancelot and Sir Lav: __ 
All this saw Sir Bors and Sir Gareth. 
“Now I dread me sore,” said Sir Bors, “that my lord 8 
lot will be hard matched.” 
‘s “By my head,” said Sir Gareth, “I will ride unto my lord 
Lancelot, to help him, come what may; for he is the same 
that made me knight.”
-P-A-G-E-162
  The Peerless Knight Lancelot 145 
  “Ye shall not do so by mine counsel,” said Sir Bors, “unless 
that ye were disguised.” . 
“Ye shall see me disguised,” said Sir Gareth. 
Therewithal he saw a Welsh knight, who was sore hurt 
;sby Sir Gawain, and to him Gareth rode and prayed him of his 
knighthood to lend him his green shield in exchange for his 
own. . 
“T will gladly,” said the Welsh knight. 
Then Sic Gareth came driving to Sir Lancelot all he might and 
lio said, “Knight, defend thyself, for yonder cometh King Arthur 
with nine knights with him to overcome you, and so I am come 
to bear you fellowship for ola love ye have showed me.” 
“T thank you greatly,” said Sir Lancelot. 
“Sir,” said Gareth, “encounter ye with Sir Gawain and I will 
is encounter with Sir Palomides and let Sir Lavaine match with the 
| noble King Arthur.” 
Then came King Arthur with his nine knights with him, and 
Sir Lancelot encountered with Sir Gawain and gave him such a 
buffet that Sir Gawain fell to the earth. Then Sir Gareth en- 
, to countered with the good knight, Sir Palomides, and he gave him 
}} such a buffet that both he and his horse fell to the earth. Then 
-} encountered King Arthur with Sir Lavaine and there either of 
_| them smote the other to the earth, horse and all, so that they lay 
;{ agreat while. 
e's Then Sir Lancelot smote down Sir Agravaine, sir Gaheris, and 
t| Sir Modred, and Sir Gareth smote down Sir Kay, Sir Safere, and 
Sir Griflet.. And then Sir Lavaine was horsed again and he smote 
9 down Sir Lucan and Sir Bedivere, and then there began a great 
‘ --ess of good knights. Then Sir Lancelot dashed here and there 
ad smote off and pulled off helmets, so that none might strike 
im a blow with spear or with sword; and Sir Gareth did such 
zeds of arms that all men marveled what knight he was with the 
teen shield, for he smote down that day and pulled down more 
aan thirty knights. 
And Sir Lancelot marveled, when he beheld Sir Gareth do 
sich deeds, what knight he might be! and Sir Lavaine pulled down 
and smote down twenty knights. Also Sir Lancelot knew not

Sir Gareth, for if Sir Tristam or Sir Lamorak had been alive, Sir 
Lancelot would have thought he had been one of the two. 
So this tournament continued till it was near night, for the 
Knights of the Round Table rallied ever unto King Arthur, for 
8 the King was wroth that he and his knights might not prevail that 
day. Then Sir Gawain said to the King, “I marvel where all this 
day Sir Bors and his fellowship of Sir Lancelot’s kindred have 
been. I marvel all this day they be not about you. It is for 
some cause,” said Sir Gawain. 
10 “By my head,” said Sir Kay, “Sir Bors is yonder all this day 
upon the right hand of this field and there he and his kindred 
have won more honor than we have.” 
“Tt may well be,” said Sir Gawain, “but I believe this knight 
with the sleeve of gold is Sir Lancelot himself. I know it by his 
15 riding and by his great strokes. And the other knight in the same 
colors is the good young knight, Sir Lavaine. Also, that knight 
with the green shield is my brother, Sir Gareth, and he has dis- 
guised himself, for no man shall ever make him be against Sir 
Lancelot, because he made him knight.” 
20 “Nephew, I believe you,” said King Arthur; “therefore tell 
me now what is your best counsel.” 
“Sir,” said Gawain, “ye shall have my counsel.

“Ye say truth,” said the King; “it were shame to us, so

And when they were unarmed, then King Arthur knew Sir 
Lancelot, Sir Lavaine and Sir Gareth. 
“Ah, Sir Lancelot,” said the King, “this day ye have heated 
. me and my knights.” 
; And so they went unto King Arthur’s lodging all together, 
and there was a great feast and the prize was given unto Sir 
Lancelot; and the heralds announced that he had smitten down 
fifty knights, and Sir Gareth, five and thirty, and Sir Lavaine, 
four and twenty knights. 
L, Then King Arthur blamed Sir Gareth, because he left his 
| fellowship and held with Sir Lancelot. 
“My lord,” said Sir Gareth, “he made me a knight and when 
I saw him so hard pressed, methought it was my duty to help 
him, for I saw him do so much and so many noble knights against - 
him; and when I understood that he was Sir Lancelot, I was 
ashamed to see so many knights against him alone.” 
“Truly,” said King Arthur unto Sir Gareth, “ye say well, and 
manfully have you done and won for yourself great honor, and 
all the days of my life I shall fove you and trust you more and 
more. For ever it is an honorable knight’s deed to help another 
honorable knight when he seeth him in great danger; for ever 
an honorable man will be sorry to see a brave man shamed. But 
he that hath no honor, and acts with cowardice, never shall he 
show gentleness nor any manner of goodness, where he seeth a 
man in any danger; for then ever will a coward show no mercy. 
And always a good man will do ever to another man as he would 
be done to himself.” 
So then there were great feasts and games and play, and all 
| manner of noble deeds were done; and he that was courteous, 
true, and faithful to his friend, was that time cherished.

  THE PASSING OF ARTHUR 
HOW SIR MODRED PLOTTED AGAINST SIR LANCELOF AND OF THE 
DEATH OF SIR GAWAIN AND TWELVE KNIGHTS 
  Before Merlin passed from the world of men, he uttered many 
marvelous prophecies and one that boded ill for King Arthur. 
| He foretold that a son of Arthur’s sister should stir up bitter war 
| against the King and that a great battle should be fought in the 
s West when many brave men should find their doom. 
Among the nephews of King Arthur was one most dishonor- 
able; his name was Modred. No knightly deed had he ever done 
and he hated even to hear the good report of others. Of all who 
| sat at the Round Table there was none that Modred hated more 
z Sir Lancelot du Lac, whom all true knights held in most 
| 
t \   
honor. In his jealous rage he spoke evil of the Queen and Sir 
Lancelot. Now Modred’s brothers, Sir Gawain and Sir Gareth, 
refused to listen to these slanders, holding that Sir Lancelot, 
in his knightly service to the Queen, did honor to King Arthur 
also. 
When these evil tales reached King Arthur, he rebuked the 
tale bearers and declared his faith in Sir Lancelot and his lady, 
the Queen. But Modred, enraged by the rebuke, determined to 
find cause against them, and not long after it seemed that the 
occasion had come. For when King Arthur had ridden forth to 
bunt far from Carlisle, where he then held court, the Queen sent 
for Lancelot to speak with her in her bower. Modred and: his 
brother, Sir Agravaine, got together twelve knights, persuading 
them that they were doing the King a service. They waited until 
they saw Lancelot enter all unarmed and then called to him to 
come forth. The whole court echoed with their cries of 
“Traitor.” Lancelot, arming himself in haste, rushed out upon 
them and soon the entire company lay cold in death upon the 
earth. Only Modred escaped, for he fled, but even so he was” 
; sore wounded.
-P-A-G-E-167
  
  150 '- Junior High School Literature, Book One 
OF THE TRIAL OF THE QUEEN 
When Modred eseaped from Sir Lancelot he got to horse, all 
wounded as he was, and never drew rein until he had found King 
Arthur, to whom he told all that had happened. 
Then great was the King’s grief. Despite all that Modred 
s could say, he was slow to doubt Sir Lancelot, whom he loved, but 
his mind was filled with forebodings; for many a knight had been 
slain, and well he knew that their kin would seek vengeance on 
Sir Lancelot, and the noble fellowship of the Round Table be 
utterly destroyed by their feuds. 
10 — All too soon it proved even as the King had feared. Many 
were found to hold with Sir Modred; some because they were 
kin to the knights that had been slain, some from envy of the 
honor and worship of the noble Sir Lancelot; and among them 
even were those who dared to raise their voice against the Queen 
1s herself, calling for judgment upon her as leagued with a traitor 
against the King, and as having caused the death of so many good 
knights. Now in those days the law was that if any one were 
accused of treason by witnesses, or taken in the act, that one 
should die the death by burning, be it man or woman, knight or 
zo churl. So then the murmurs grew to a loud clamor that the law 
should have its course, and that King Arthur should pass sentence 
on the Queen. Then was the King’s woe doubled. 
“For,” said he, “I sit as King to be a rightful judge anc 
all the law; wherefore I may not do battle for my own Queet., —. 
2s now there is none other to help her.” 
So a decree was issued that Queen Guinevere should b« 
at the stake outside the walls of Carlisle. 
Forthwith, King Arthur sent for his nephew, Sir Gawa: 
said to him: 
so’ “Fair nephew, I give it in charge to you to see that all | 
as has been decreed.” 
But Sir Gawain answered boldly: “Sir King, never will I be 
present to see my lady. the Queen die. It is of ill counsel that ye 
have consented to her death.” : 
38 Then the King bade Gawain send his two young brothers
-P-A-G-E-168
  The Passing of Arthur 151 
Gareth and Sir Gaheris, to receive his commands, and these he 
desired to attend the Queen to the place of execution. So Gareth 
made answer for both: 
“My Lord the King, we owe you obedience in all things, but 
know that it is sore against our wills that we obey you in this; 
nor will we appear in arms in the place where that noble lady 
shall die”; then sorrowfully they mounted their horses and. rode 
to Carlisle. 
When the day appointed had come, the Queen was led forth 
to a place without the walls of Carlisle, and there she was bound 
to the stake to be burnt to death. Loud were her ladies’ lamen- 
tations, and many a lord. was found to weep at that grievous sight 
of a Queen brought so low; yet was there none who dared come 
forward as her champion, lest he should be suspected of treason. 
As for Gareth and Gaheris, they could not bear the sight, and 
stood with their faces covered in their mantles. Then, just as 
the torch was to be applied to the fagots, there was a sound as 
of many horses galloping, and the next instant a band of knights 
rushed upon the astonished throng, their leader cutting down all 
» who crossed his path until he had reached the Queen, whom he 
lifted to his saddle and bore from the press. Then all men knew 
that it was Sir Lancelot, come knightly to rescue the Queen, and 
in their hearts they rejoiced. So with little hindrance they rode 
away, Sir Lancelot and all his kin with the Queen in their midst, 
5 till they came to the castle of the Joyous Garde, where they held 
the Queen in safety and all reverence. 
- But of that day came a kingdom’s ruin; for among the slain 
were Gawain’s brothers Sir Gareth and Sir Gaheris. Now Sir 
Lancelot loved Sir Gareth as if he had been his own younger 
» brother, and himself had knighted him; but, in the press, he 
struck at him and killed him, not seeing that he was unarmed 
and weaponless; and in like wise, Sir Gaheris met his death. So 
when word was brought to King Arthur of what had passed, Sir 
Gawain asked straightway how his brothers had fared.

“Alas! my dear brothers!” cried Sir Gawain; “how came they

HOW SIR GAWAIN DEFIED SIR LANCELO™ 
Now it came to the ears of the Pope in Rome th: 
a0 was besieging Sir Lancelot in the castle of the Joy: 
it grieved him that there should be strife between ti | 
knights, the like of whom was not to be found i: 
So he called to him the Bishop of Rochester and |: : 
word to Britain, both to Arthur and to Sir Lanc i 
28 should be reconciled, the one to the other, and th: 
should receive again Queen Guinevere. 
Forthwith Sir Lancelot desired of King Arthur assurance 
liberty and reverence for the Queen, as also safe « 
himself and his knights, that he might bring Queer 
80 with due honor to the King at Carlisle; and theret 
pledged his word. 
So Lancelot set forth with the Queen, and behind them rx 
a hundred knights arrayed in green velvet, the housings of - 
horses of the same, all studded with precious stones; thus tl 
35 passed through the city of Carlisle openly, in the sight of all, «

  The Passing of Arthur 153 
there were many who rejoiced that the Queen was come again 
*~p Lancelot with her, though they of Gawain’s party scowled 
iim. 
ien they were come into the great hall where Arthur sat 
‘ir Gawain and other great lords about him, Sir Lancelot 
linevere to the throne and both knelt before the King; then 
Sir Lancelot lifted the Queen to her feet and thus he spoke 
g Arthur, boldly and well, before the whole court: 
~ivly lord, Sir Arthur, I bring you here your Queen, than whom 
y no truer nor nobler lady ever lived; and here stand I, Sir Lancelot 
du Lac, ready to do battle with any that dare gainsay it”; and 
2se words Sir Lancelot turned and looked upon the lords 
zhts present in their places, but none would challenge him 
zause, not even Sir Gawain, for he had ever affirmed that 
xuinevere was a true and honorable lady. 
1 Sir Lancelot spoke again: “Now, my Lord Arthur, in 
: defense it behooves me to say that never-in aught have 
false to you. That I slew certain knights is true, but I 
guiltless, seeing that they brought death upon themselves. 
sooner had I gone to the Queen’s bower, as she had 
ided me, than they beset the door with shameful outcry,

they proved not themselves right, else had not I, alone,

“Tt is full plain, Sir Gawain,” said Lancelot, “that never again,

“Tt shall not avail you now,” said Sir Gawain; “traitor ye are, 
both to the King and to me. Know that while life lasts, never

upon you.” 
“Fair nephew,” said the King, “cease your bawlin; 
Lancelot has come under surety of my word that none s 
him harm. Elsewhere, and at another time, fasten a quarr: 
10 him, if quarrel ye must.” 
“T care not,” cried Sir Gawain fiercely. “The proud ‘ 
trusts so in his own strength that he thinks none dare me:

and, if need be, fight even against you.” 
“Peace,” said the King, and to Sir Lancelot: “We give yo 
fifteen days in which to leave this kingdom.” 
Then Sir Lancelot sighed heavily and said, “Full well I se 
20 that no sorrow of mine for what is past availeth me “ 
Then he went to the Queen where she sat, and said

Sir Lancelot. Yet was he loath to leave the land where he h

part in anger from King Arthur. 
“My mind misgives me,” said Sir Lancelot, “but that

ate A 
shall come of Sir Modred, for he is envious and a mischief-maker, 
and it grieves me that never more I may serve King Arthur and 
his realm.” 
So Sir Lancelot sorrowed; but his kinsmen, wroth for the dis- 
shonor done him, made haste to depart and, by the fifteenth day, 
they were all embarked to sail overseas to France. 
HOW KING ARTHUR AND SIR GAWAIN WENT TO FRANCE 
From the day when Sir Lancelot brought the Queen to Car- 
lisle, never would Gawain suffer the King to be at rest; but always 
he desired him to call his army together that they might go to 
» attack Sir Lancelot in his own land. 
Now King Arthur was loath to war against Sir Lancelot, and 
| seeing this, Sir Gawain upbraided. him bitterly. 
| “T see well it is naught to you that my brother, Sir Gareth, 
“ed fulfilling your behest. Little ye care if all your knights be 
ain, if only the traitor Lancelot escape. Since, then, ye will 
at do me justice nor avenge your own nephew, I and my fellows 
ill take the traitor when.and how we may. He trusts in his 
vn might that none can encounter with him; let see if we may 
yt entrap him.” 
Thus urged, King Arthur called his army together and ordered 
tat a great fleet be collected; for rather would he fight openly 
ith Sir Lancelot than that Sir Gawain should bring such dis- 
mor upon himself as to slay a noble knight treacherously. So 
ith a great host, the King passed overseas to France, leaving 
t Modred to rule Britain in his stead. . 
When Lancelot heard that King Arthur and Sir Gawain were 
ming against him, he withdrew into the strong castle of Ben- 
wick; for unwilling, indeed, was he to fight with the King, or to 
do an injury to Sir Gareth’s brother. The army passed through 
the land, laying it waste, and presently encamped about the castle, 
besieging it closely; but so thick were the walls and so watchful 
the garrison that in no way could they prevail against it. . 
One day, there came to Sir Lancelot seven brethren, brave 
lights of Wales, who had joined their fortunes to his, and said: 
“Sir Lancelot, bid us sally forth against this host wh‘ch has
-P-A-G-E-173
156 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
invaded and laid waste your Jands, and we will scatter it; for we 
are not wont to cower behind walls.” 
“Fair lords,” answered Lancelot, “it is grief to me to war on 
good Christian knights and especially upon my lord, King Arthur. 
& Have but patience, and I will send to him and see if, even now, 
there may not be a treaty of peace between us, for better far is 
peace than war.” 
So Sir Lancelot sought out a damsel and, mounting her upon 
a palfrey, bade her ride to King Arthur’s camp and require of 
1o the King to cease warring on his lands, proffering fair terms of 
peace. When the damsel came to the camp, there met her Sir 
Lucan the Butler. 
“Fair damsel,” said Sir Lucan, “do ye come from Sir Lance- 
lot?” 
w “Yea, in good truth,” said the damsel; “and, I pray you, lead 
me to King Arthur.” : 
“Now may ye prosper in your errand,” said Sir Lucan. “Our 
King loves Sir Lancelot dearly and wishes him well; but Sir 
Gawain will not suffer him to be reconciled to him.” 
20 So when the damsel had come before the King, she told him 
all her tale, and much she said of Sir Lancelct’s love and good- 
will to his lord the King, so that the tears stood in Arthur’s eyes. 
But Sir Gawain broke in roughly: 
“My lord and uncle, shall it be said of us that we cam: 
25 with such a host to hie us home again, nothing done, tc 
scoff of all men?” 
“Nephew,” said the King, “methinks Sir Lancelot o” 
and generously. It were well if ye would accept hi: 
Nevertheless, as the quarrel is yours, so shall the answe. vw. 
30 “Then, damsel,” said Sir. Gawain, “say unto Sir Lancelot that 
the time for peace is past. And tell him that I, Sir Gawain, sweat 
by the faith I owe to knighthood that never will I forego my 
revenge.” 
So the damsel returned to Sir Lancelot and told him al 
35 Lancelot’s heart was filled with grief nigh unto breakin; 
his knights were enraged and clamored that he had endur 
much of insult and wrong, and that he should lead them !
-P-A-G-E-174
  The Passing of Arthur 157 
to battle. Sir Lancelot armed him sorrowfully and presently the 
gates were set open and he rode forth, he and all his company. 
But to all his knights he had given commandment that none should 
seek King Arthur; “for never,” said he, “will I see the noble King 
swho made me knight, either killed or shamed.” * 
Fierce was the battle between those two hosts. On Lancelot’s 
side, Sir Bors and Sir Lavaine and many another did right well; 
while on the other side, King Arthur bore him as the noble knight 
he was, and Sir Gawain raged through the battle, seeking to come 
fo at Sir Lancelot. Presently, Sir Bors encountered King Arthur 
_ and unhorsed him, This Sir Lancelot saw and, coming to the 
King’s side, he alighted and raising him from the ground, mounted 
him upon his own horse. Then King Arthur, looking upon Lance- 
lot, eried, “Ah! Lancelot, Lancelot! That ever there should be 
s war between us two!” and tears stood in the King’s eyes. 
| “Ah! my Lord Arthur,” cried Sir Lancelot, “I pray you stop 
* this war.” 
As they spoke thus, Sir Gawain came upon them and, calling 
Sir Lancelot traitor and coward, had almost ridden upon him 
before Lancelot could find another horse. Then the two hosts 
drew back, each on its own side, to see the battle between Sir 
Lancelot and Sir Gawain; for they wheeled their horses and, 
departing far asunder, rushed again upon each other with the 
noise of thunder, and each bore the other from his horse. Then 
they put their shields before them and set on each other with 
their swords; but while ever Sir Gawain smote fiercely, Sir Lance- 
lot was content only to ward off blows, because he would not, 
for Sir Gareth’s sake, do any harm to Sir Gawain, But the more 
Sir Lancelot forebore him, the more furiously Sir Gawain struck, 
5 so that Sir Lancelot had much ado to defend himself and at the 
last smote Gawain on the helm so mightily that he bore him to 
the ground. Then Sir Lancelot stood back from Sir Gawain. 
But Gawain cried: 
‘Why do ye draw back, traitor knight? Slay y ye while ye 
may, fgg never will I cease to be your enemy while my life lasts.” 
“Sir,® said Lancelot, “I shall withstand you as I may; but 
("" will I smite a fallen knight.”

Then he spoke to King Arthur: ‘My Lord, I pray you, if only 
for this day, draw off your men. And think upon our former love 
if ye may; but, be ye friend or foe, God keep you.” . 
Thereupon Sir Lancelot drew off his men into his castle and 
King Arthur and his company to their tents. As for Sir Gawain, 
his squires bore him to his tent where his wounds were dressed. 
OF MODRED THE TRAITOR 
So Sir Gawain lay healing of the grim wound which Sir Lance- 
lot had given him, and there was peace between the two armies, 
when there came messengers from Britain bearing letters for 
King Arthur; and more evil news than they brought might not 
well be, for they told how Sir Modred had usurped his uncle's 
realm. First, he had caused it to be noised abroad that King 
Arthur was slain in battle with Sir Lancelot and, since thev- ’ 
many ever ready to believe any idle rumor and eager fi 
change, it had been no hard task for Sir Modred to call thi 
to a Parliament and persuade them to make him king. Bus un 
Queen could not be brought to believe that her lord was dead, 0 
she took refuge in the Tower of London from Sir Modred’s vio- 
lence, nor was she to be induced to leave her strong refuge for 
aught that Modred could promise or threaten. 
This was the news that came to Arthur as he lay 
about Sir Lancelot’s castle of Benwick. Forthwith, | 
host make ready to move and, when they had reache 
they embarked and made sail to reach Britain with 
speed. 
Sir Modred, on his part, had heard of their sailing and haste 
to get together a great army. It was grievous to see ho: | 
a stout knight held by Modred, ay, even many whom 
himself had raised to honor and fortune; for it is the navusc v 
men to be fickle. Thus it was that, when Arthur drew near t 
Dover, he found Modred with a mighty host waiting *- : 
his landing. Then there was a great sea-fight, those o/ 
party going out in boats, great and small, to board Ki 
ships and slay him and his men or ever they should cor 
Right valiantly did King Arthur bear him, as was his wou, au

boldly his followers fought in his cause, so that at last they drove 
off their enemies and landed at Dover in spite of Modred and his . 
array. For that time Modred fled, and King Arthur bade these of 
his party bury the slain and tend the wounded. 
s So as they passed from ship to ship, salving and binding the 
hurts of the men, they came at last upon Sir Gawain, where he 
lay at the bottom of a boat, wounded to the death, for he had 
received a great blow on the wound that Sir Lancelot had given 
him. They bore him to his tent and his uncle, the King, came to 
o him, sorrowing beyond measure. 
“Methinks,” said the King, “my joy on earth is done; for 
ave I loved any men as I have loved you, my nephew, and 
celot. Sir Lancelot I have lost, and now I see you on your 
ed.” 
7 King,” said Sir Gawain, “my hour is come and I have 
death at Sir Lancelot’s hand; for I am smitten on the 
he gave me. And rightly am I served, for of my wilful- 
i stubbornness comes this unhappy war. I pray you, my 
‘aise me in your arms and let me write to Sir Lancelot 
( die.” 
s, then, Sir Gawain wrote: “To Sir Lancelot, the noblest 
nights, I, Gawain, send greeting before I die. For I am 
on the wound ye gave me before your castle of Benwick 
ce, and I bid all men bear witness that I sought my own 
nd that ye are innocent of it. I pray you, by our friend- 
old, come again into Britain and, when ye look upon my 
way for Gawain of Orkney. Farewell.” 
sir Gawain died and was buried in the Chapel at Dover. 
OF THE BATTLE IN THE WEST 
The day after the battle at Dover, King Arthur and his host 
pursued Sir Modred to Barham Down, where again there was a 
great battle fought, with much slaughter on both sides; but, in 
the end, Arthur was victorious, and Modred fled to Canterbury, 
Now by this time, many that Modred had cheated by his 
\ lying reports, had drawn unto King Arthur, to whom at heart 
they had ever been loyal, knowing him for a true and noble King
-P-A-G-E-177
  
160 Junior High School Literature, Book One   
and hating themselves for having been deceived by such a false 
usurper as Sir Modred. Then when he found that he was being 
deserted, Sir Modred withdrew to the far West, for there men 
knew less of what had happened, and so he might still find some 
5 to believe in him and support him}; and being without ¢----*-~~- 
he even called to his aid the heathen hosts that his wv: 
Arthur, had driven from the land in the good years whe 
was of the Round Table. 
King Arthur followed ever after, for in his heart 
10 anger against the false nephew who had brought woe 
and all his realm. At the last, when Modred could fi 
ther, the two hosts were drawn up near the shore of 
western sea; and it was the Feast of the Holy Trinity. 
That night, as King Arthur slept, he thought the*+ “*- “-—-* 
15 stood before him, looking just as he did in life, and 
“My uncle and my King, God in his great love 
me to come unto you, to warn you that in no wise y 
morrow; for if ye do, ye shall be slain and with you 
of the people on both sides. Make ye, therefore, 
20 month and within that time, Sir Lancelot shall com 
all his knights and ye shall overthrow the traitor 
hold with him.” 
Therewith Sir Gawain vanished. Immediate 
awoke and called to him the best and wisest of hi 
25 two brethren, Sir Lucan the Butler and Sir Bedive 
to whom he told his dream. Then all were agreed usu, us as 
terms whatsoever, a treaty should be made with Sir Modred, ev: 
as Sir Gawain had said; and with the dawn, messengers went, 
the camp of the enemy, to call Sir Modred to a conference. °~ 
30 was determined that the meeting should take place in the 
of both armies, in an open space between the two camps, an 
King Arthur and Modred should each be accompanied by 
teen knights. Little enough faith had either in the oth.u., 
when they set forth to the meeting, they bade their hosts j 
85 battle if ever they saw a sword drawn. Thus they went to 
conference. . 
Now as they talked, it happened that an adder, coming out

THE DEATH OF ARTHUR

to do. Hereafter shalt thou weep if thou wilt. But take now 
my sword Excalibur, hasten to the water side and fling it inte 
the deep. Then watch what happens and bring me word thereof.” 
“My Lord,” said Sir Bedivere, “your command shall be 
s obeyed”; and taking the sword, he departed. But as he went on 
his way he looked on the sword, how wondrously it was formed, 
and the hilt all studded with precious stones; and, as he looked, 
‘he called to mind the marvel by which it had come into the King’s 
keeping. For on a certain day, as Arthur walked on the shore 
1o of a great lake, there had appeared above the surface of the water 
a hand brandishing a sword. On the instant, the King had leaped 
into a boat, and, rowing into the lake, had got the sword and 
brought it back to land. Then he had seen how, on one side the 
blade, was written, “Keep me,” but on the other, “Throw me 
is away,” and sore perplexed, he had shown it to Merlin, the great 
wizard, who said: “Keep it now. The time for casting away has 
not yet come.” 
Thinking on this, it seemed to Bedivere that no good, but 
harm, must come of obeying the King’s word; so hiding the sword 
20 under a tree, he hastened back to the little chapel. 
Then said the King: “What saw’st thou?” 
“Sir,” answered Bedivere, “I saw naught but the waves, heard 
naught but the wind.” 
“That is untrue,” said King Arthur; “I charge thee, as thou 
25 art true knight, go again and spare not to throw away the s~-~*” 
Sir Bedivere departed a second time and his mind was t 
his lord; but when he took the sword in his hand, he thoug 
“Sin it is and shameful, to throw away so glorious a sword’ 
Then hiding it again, he hastened back to the King. 
30 “What saw’st thou?” said King Arthur. 
“Sir, I saw the water lap on the crags.” 
Then spoke the King in great wrath: “Traitor and unkind 
Twice hast thou betrayed me! Art dazzled by the splendor o} 
the jewels, thou that, till now, hast ever been dear and true t 
3s me? Go yet again, but if thou fail me this time, I will arise an 
with mine own hands, slay thee.” 
Then Sir Bedivere left the King and, that time, he teok th

sword quickly from the place where he had hidden it and, for- 
bearing even to look upon it, he twisted the belt about it and 
flung it with all his force into the water. A wondrous sight he 
saw, for, as the sword touched the water, a hand rose from out the 
sdeep, caught it, brandished it thrice and threw it beneath the 
surface. 
So Bedivere hastened back to the King and told him what he 
had seen. . 
“Tt is well,” said Arthur; “now, bear me to the water’s edge 
19 and hasten, I pray thee, for I have tarried over long and my 
wound has taken cold.” 
So Sir Bedivere raised the King on his back and bore him 
tenderly to the lonely shore, where the lapping waves floated 
many an empty helmet and the fitful moonlight fell on the up- 
1s turned faces of the dead. Scarce had they reached the shore 
| when there hove in sight a barge, and on its deck stood three tall 
women, robed all in black and wearing crowns on their heads. 
“Place me in the barge,” said Arthur, and softly Sir Bedivere 
lifted the King into it. And these three’ queens wept sore over 
w Arthur, and one took his head in her lap and chafed his hands, 
crying: 
“Alas! my brother, thou hast been overlong in coming, and I 
fear me thy wound has taken cold.” 
Then the barge began to move slowly forth. from the land. 
*s When Sir Bedivere saw this, he lifted up his voice and cried with 
abitter ery: 
“Ah! my Lord Arthur, thou art taken from me! And I, 
whither shall I go?” / 
) “Comfort thyself,” said the King, “for in me is no comfort 
fmore. I pass to the Valley of Avilion, to heal me of my grievous 
wound. If thou seest me never again, pray for me.” 
So the barge floated away out of sight and Sir Bedivere stood 
straining his eyes after it till it had vanished utterly. Then he 
tuned him about and journeyed through the forest until, at. day- 
lS break, he reached a hermitage. Entering it, he prayed the holy 
| hermit that he might abide with him and there he spent the rest 
| of his life in prayer and holy exercise.

say that he is not dead, but abides in the happy Valley of Avilion

HOW QUEEN GUINEVERE BECAME A NUN AT ALMESBURY AND OF 
THE DEATH OF SIR LANCELOT 
When news reached Sir Lancelot in his own land of the treason 
ao of Modred, he gathered his lords and knights together, and rested 
not till he had come to Britain to aid King Arthur. He landed 
at Dover and there the evil tidings were told him, how the King 
had met his death at the hands of his traitor nephew. Then was 
Sir Lancelot’s heart nigh broken for grief. 
as = “Alas!” he cried, “that I should live to know my King over- 
thrown by such a felon! What have I done that I should have 
caused the deaths of the good knights Sir Gareth, Sir Gaheris, 
and Sir Gawain, and yet that such a villain should escape my 
sword!” 
20 Then he desired to be led to Sir Gawain’s tomb, where he 
remained long in prayer and in great lamentation; after which, 
he called to him his kinsmen and friends and said to them: 
“My fair lords, I thank you all most heartily that, of your 
courtesy, ye came with me to this land. That we be come too 
25 late is a misfortune that might not be avoided, though I shall 
mourn it my life long. And now I will ride forth alone to find 
my lady the Queen in the West, whither men say she has fied. 
Wait for me, I pray you, for fifteen days and then, if ye hear 
naught of me, return to your own lands.” 
30 So Sir Lancelot rode forth alone, nor would he suffer any to 
follow him despite their prayers and entreaties. 
Thus he rode some seven or eight days until, at the last, he 
came to a nunnery where he saw in the cloister many nuns wait-
-P-A-G-E-182
  
The Passing of Arthur 165 
  ing on a fair lady, none other, indeed, than Queen Guinevere 
herself. And she, looking up, saw Sir Lancelot and, at the sight, 
grew so pale that her ladies feared for her; but she recovered and. 
bade them go and bring Sir Lancelot to her presence. When he 
5 was come, she said to him: 
“Sir Lancelot, glad am I to see thee once again that I may bid 
thee farewell; for in this world shall we never meet again.” 
“Sweet Madam,” answered Sir Lancelot, “I was minded, with: 
your leave, to bear you to my own country, where I doubt not but. 
10 I should guard you well and safely from your enemies.” 
“Nay, Lancelot,” said the Queen, “that may not be; I am 
resolved never to look upon the world again, but here to pass my 
life in prayer and in such good works as I may. But thou, do thou 
_ get back to thine own land and take a fair wife, and ye both 
ws shall ever have my prayers.” 
“Madam,” replied Sir Lancelot, “ye know well that shall 
never be. And since ye are resolved to lead a life of prayer, I, 
too, will forsake the world if I can find hermit to share his cell 
with me; for ever your will has been mine.” 
z0 Long and earnestly he looked upon her as though he might 
never gaze enough; then, getting to horse, he rode slowly away. 
Nor did they ever meet again in life. For Queen Guinevere 
abode in the great nunnery of Almesbury where Sir Lancelot had 
found her and presently, for the holiness of her life, was made 
, 2% Abbess. But Sir Lancelot, after he had left her, rode on his way 
till he came to the cell where Sir Bedivere dwelt with the holy 
hermit; and when Sir Bedivere had told him all that had befallen, 
5 of the great battle in the West, and of the passing away of Arthur, 
Sir Lancelot flung down his arms and implored the holy hermit to. 
( so let him remain there as the servant of God. So Sir Lancelot 
donned the serge gown and abode in the hermitage as the priest. 
of God. 
Presently, there came riding that way the good Sir Bors, 
Lancelot’s nephew; for, when Sir Lancelot returned not to Dover, 
% Sir Bors and many another knight went forth in search of him. 
There, then, Sir Bors remained and, within a half year, there 
| joined themselves to these three many who in former days had
-P-A-G-E-183
  266 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
  
been fellows of the Round Table; and the fame of their piety 
spread far and wide. 
So six years passed and then, one night, Lancelot had a vision. 
It seemed to him that one said to him: 
5 “Lancelot, arise and go in haste to Almesbury. There shalt 
thou find Queen Guinevere dead and it shall be for thee to bury 
her.” 
Sir Lancelot arose at once and, calling his fellows to him, told 
them his dream. Immediately, with all haste, they set forth 
10 toward Almesbury and, arriving there the second day, found the 
Queen dead, as had been foretold in the vision. So with the state 
and ceremony befitting a great Queen, they buried her in the 
Abbey of Glastonbury, in that same church where, some say, 
King Arthur’s tomb is to be found. Lancelot it was who per- 
1 formed the funeral rites and chanted the requiem; but when all 
was done, he pined away, growing weaker daily. So at the end 
of six weeks, he called to him his fellows and, bidding them all 
farewell, desired that his dead body should be conveyed to the 
Joyous Garde, there to be buried, for that in the church at Glas- 
ze tonbury he was not worthy to lie. And that same night he died, 
and was buried, as he had desired, in his own castle. So passed 
from the world the bold Sir Lancelot du Lae, bravest, most cour- 
teous, and most gentle of knights, whose peer the world has never 
seen nor ever shall see. 
2 After Sir Lancelot’s death, Sir Bors and the piouw 
his companions, took their way to the Holy Land and t 
died in battle against the Turk. 
So ends this story of King Arthur and his noble fell 
the Round Table.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Historical Note. The old folk ballads, of which this one is an excel- 
lent example, have all come down to us from the far-off past. Such ballads 
are not the work of any one author, but like the stories of King Arthur, were 
preserved mainly in the memories of men. Some of them ‘were sung or 
recited to the music of the harp or lute by minstrels who wandered from 
village to village, and from castle to castle, entertaining their hearers in 
return for food and lodging; or by the bards and minstrels who were main- 
tained by kings and nobles to entertain them and to celebrate their deeds 
and honors. Often they were made by the people, not by professional 
singers, and were expressions of the folk love of adventure. Indeed, the 
best definition of a popular, or folk, ballad is that it is “a tale telling itself 
in song.” ‘This means that a ballad always tells a story; that it has no 
known author, being composed by several people or by a community and 
then handed down orally, not in writing, from generation to generation; 
and finally, that it is sung, not recited. In this way such folk.” ~ 
“Sir Patrick Spens” were transmitted for generations, in differe! 
before they were written down and became a part of what we ca 
that is, something written. When the invention of the pri: 
made it possible to put these old ballads in a permanent form, they 
collected from the recitations of old men and women who knew them: 
printed. Thus they have become a precious literary possession, tell) _ 
something of the life, the history, and the standards, superstitions, and 
beliefs of distant times, and thrilling us with their stirring stories. The 
beauty of these old ballads lies in the story they tell; and in their directness 
and simplicity. They are almost wholly without literary ornament; theil 
language is the language of the people, not of the court. 
Many modern poets have written stories in verse which are also callec 
ballads. Some are in imitation of the old ballads, using the old balla 
meter and riming system, and employing old-fashioned words and expres 
sions, to add to the effect. Other moderh ballads are simple narratives it 
verse—short stories dealing with stirring subjects, with battle, adv 
~ ete. But while the true old ballad holds the attention upon the stor. i 
the modern baHads often introduce descriptions of the characters. 
Discussion, 1. Why did the king choose Sir Patrick Spens? 2. Wh: 
did Sir Patrick say when he had read the king’s letter? 3. What signs of 
storm had been noticed? 4. Point out all the ways in which the ball: 
tells that the ship was wrecked. 5. How have the old ballads come do 
to us? 6. What other old ballad have you read? 7. Tell how the o 
ballads came into being, and name a characteristic of them. 8. What do t 
old ballads tell us of the life of the early people? 9. How does a mode 
ballad differ from a folk, or popular, ballad? :

  THE SKELETON IN ARMOR 
HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW 
“Speak! speak! thou fearful guest] 
Who, with thy hollow breast 
Still in rude armor drest, 
Comest to daunt me! 
Wrapt not in Eastern balms, 
- But with thy fleshless palms 
Stretched, as if asking alms, 
Why dost thou haunt me?” 
Then, from those cavernous eyes 
Pale flashes seemed to rise, 
As when the Northern skies 
Gleam in December; 
And, like the water’s flow 
Under December’s snow, 
Came a dull voice of woe 
From the heart’s chamber. 
“T was a Viking old! 
My deeds, though manifold, 
No Skald in song has told, 
No Saga taught thee! 
Take heed, that in thy verse 
Thou dost the tale rehearse, 
Else dread a dead man’s curse; 
For this I sought thee. 
“Far in the Northern Land, 
By the wild Baltic’s strand, 
I, with my childish hand, 
Tamed the gerfalcon;

  And, with my skates fast-bound, 
Skimmed the half-frozen Sound, 
That the poor whimpering hound

“Oft to his frozen lair 
Tracked I the grizzly bear, 
While from my path the hare 
Fled like a shadow; 
Oft through the forest dark 
Fatlowed the were-wolf’s bark, 
Until the soaring lark 
Sang from the meadow. 
“But when I older grew, 
Joining a corsair’s crew, 
Over the dark sea I flew 
With the marauders. 
Wild was the life we led, 
Many the souls that sped, 
Many the hearts that bled, 
By our stern orders. 
“Many a wassail-bout 
Wore the long winter out; 
Often our midnight shout 
Set the cocks crowing, 
As we the Berserk’s tale 
Measured in cups of ale, 
Draining the oaken pail, 
Filled to o’erflowing. 
“Once as I told in glee 
Tales of the stormy sea, 
Soft eyes did gaze on me, 
Burning yet tender;

  And as the white stars shine 
On the dark Norway pine, 
On that dark heart of mine 
Fell their soft splendor. 
“T wooed the blue-eyed maid, 
Yielding, yet half afraid, 
And in the forest’s shade 
Our vows were plighted. 
Under its loosened vest 
Fluttered her little breast, 
Like birds within their nest 
By the hawk frighted. 
“Bright in her father’s hall 
Shields gleamed upon the wall, 
Loud sang the minstrels all, 
Chanting his glory;. 
When of old Hildebrand 
IT asked his daughter’s hand, 
Mute did the minstrels stand 
To hear my story. 
“While the brown ale he quaffed, 
Loud then the champion laughed, 
And as the wind-gusts waft 
The sea-foam brightly, 
So the loud laugh of scorn, 
Out of those lips unshorn, 
From the deep drinking-horn 
Blew the foam lightly. 
“She was a Prince’s child, 
I but a Viking wild, 
And though she blushed and smiled, 
I was discarded! :

Why did they leave that night 
Her nest unguarded? 
“Scarce had I put to sea, 
Bearing the maid with me,— 
Fairest of all was she 
Among the Norsemen !— 
When on the white sea-strand, 
Waving his arméd hand, 
Saw we old Hildebrand, 
With twenty horsemen. 
“Then launched they.to the blast, 
Bent like a reed each mast, 
Yet we were gaining fast, 
When the wind failed us; 
And with a sudden flaw 
Came round the gusty Skaw, 
So that our foe we saw 
Laugh as he hailed us. 
“And as to catch the gale 
Round veered the flapping sail, 
Death! was the helmsman’s hail, 
Death without quarter! 
Mid-ships with iron keel 
Struck we her ribs of steel;

Seeking some rocky, haunt,

Stands looking seaward. 
“There lived we many years; 
Time dried the maiden’s tears;

    The Three Fishers 177 
  THE THREE FISHERS 
CHARLES KINGSLEY 
Three fishers went sailing away to the West, 
Away to the West as the sun went down; 
Each thought on the woman who loved him the best, 
. And the children stood watching them out of the town; 
For men must work and women must weep, 
And there’s little to earn and many to keep, 
Though the harbor bar be moaning. 
o 
Three wives sat up in the lighthouse tower, 
And they trimmed the lamps as the sun went down; 
They looked at the squall and they looked at the shower, 
And the nightrack came rolling up ragged and brown; 
But men must work and women must weep, — 
Though storms be sudden and waters deep, 
And the harbor bar be moaning. 
Three corpses lay out on the shining sands, 
In the morning gleam as the tide went down, 
And the women are weeping and wringing their hands 
For those who will never come home to the town; 
For men must work and women must weep, 
And the sooner it’s over the sooner to sleep, 
And good-bye to the bar and its moaning.

Biography. Charles Kingsley (1819-1875), clergyman, lecturer, poet, and 
novelist, was born in Dartmoor, England. During his earlier years he lived 
in the beautiful Fen Country, the scenery of which made a deep impression 
on him. He was a friend ci Tennyson and a poet of real excellence. His 
ballads, “The Three Fishers” and “The Sands of Dee,” are widely read and 
admired, and his novel Westward Ho! is a brilliant narrative of adventure. 
In “The Three Fishers” he shows that he has studied the fishet folk of his 
native courtry and sees with genuine sympathy their hard life and the 
courage that enables them to brave the perils of the sea.

  LORD ULLIN’S DAUGHTER 
: THOMAS CAMPBELL 
A chieftain to the Highlands bound 
Cries “Boatman, do not tarry! 
And I'll give thee a silver pound 
‘To row us o’er the ferry!” 
-»@4Now who be ye, would cross Lochgyle, 
This dark and stormy water?” 
“O Ym the chief-of Ulva’s isle, 
And this, Lord Ullin’s daughter. 
“And fast before her father’s men 
Three days we've fled together, 
For should he find us in the glen, 
My blood would stain the heather, 
“His horsemen hard behind us ride— 
Should they our steps discover, 
Then who will cheer my bonny bride, 
When they have slain her lover?”
-P-A-G-E-196
Lord Ullin’s Daughter 179 
Out spoke the hardy Highland wight, - 
“Yl go, my chief, I’m ready; 
It is not for your silver bright, 
But for your winsome lady. 
“And by my word! the bonny bird 
In danger shall not tarry; 
So though the waves are raging white 
I'll row you o’er the ferry.” 
By this the storm grew loud apace, 
The water-wraith was shrieking; 
And in the scowl of Heaven each face 
Grew dark as they were speaking, 
But still as wilder blew the wind, 
And as the night grew drearer, 
Adown the glen rede arméd men, 
Their trampling sounded nearer. ; 
“O haste thee, haste!” the lady cries, 
“Though tempests round us gather; 
Tl meet the raging of the skies, 
But not an angry father.” 
The boat has left a stormy land, 
A stormy sea before her— 
When, oh! too strong for human hand 
The tempest gather’d o’er her. 
And still they row’d amidst the roar 
Of waters fast prevailing; 
Lord Ullin reach’d that fatal shore— 
His wrath was changed to wailing.

For, sore dismay’d, through storm and shade 
His child he did discover; 
One lovely hand she streteh’d for aid, 
And one was round her lover. 
“Come back! come back!” he cried in grief, 
“Across this stormy water; 
And I'll forgive your Highland chief, 
My daughter!—Oh, my daughter!” 
’*T was vain: the loud waves lash’d the shore, 
Return or aid preventing; 
The waters wild went o’er his child, 
And he was left lamenting. 
NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Biography. Thomas Campbell (1777-1844) was a popular Scottish poet. 
. He was born in Glasgow, his father being a prominent merchant of that 
city. At an early age Campbell began to write poetry, and at twenty-one 
had published “The Pleasures of Hope,” a poem that was received with 
much favor. He excelled in war poetry, his “Hohenlinden”, “The Battle 
of the Baltic”, and “Ye Mariners of England” being the most widely read. 
His ballads “Lochiel” and “Lord Ullin’s Daughter” are the best known. 
Campbell is remembered not alone for these stirring narrative poems, but 
also for the excellence of favorite lines that he wrote, such as “To live in 
the hearts we leave behind is not to die,” and “ ’Tis distance lends enchant- 
ment to the view.”

Louder yelled, and nearer crept; 
Round and round the jungle-serpent

Pray today!” the soldier said; 
“Tomorrow, death’s between us

Then up spake a Scottish maiden, 
With her car unto the ground: 
“Dinna ye hear it?—dinna ye hear it? 
The pipes o’ Havelock sound!” 
Hushed the wounded man his groaning; 
Hushed the wife her little ones; 
Alone they heard the drum-roll 
And the roar of Sepoy guns. 
But to sounds of home and childhood 
The Highland ear was true; 
As her mother’s cradle-crooning 
The mountain pipes she knew. 
Like the march of soundless music 
Through the vision of the seer, 
More of feeling than of hearing, 
Of the heart than of the ear, 
She knew the droning pibroch, 
She knew the Campbell’s call; 
“Hark! hear ye no’ MacGregor’s, 
The grandest o’ them all!” 
O they listened, dumb and breathless, 
And they caught the sound at last; 
Faint and far beyond the Goomtee 
Rose and fell the piper’s blast! 
Then a burst of wild thanksgiving 
Mingled woman’s voée and man’s; 
“God be praised!—the March of Havelock! 
The piping of the clans!”

Sharp and shrill as swords at strife, 
Came the wild MacGregor’s clan-call, 
Stinging all the air to life. -

O’er the cruel roll of war-drums 
Rose that sweet and homelike strain; 
And the tartan clove the turban, 
As the Goomtee cleaves the plain. 
Dear to the corn-land reaper

O’er mountain, glen, and glade; 
But the sweetest of all music

Historical Note. The Indian Mutiny was the great revolt of the 
Bengal native army (the Sepoys) against the British rule in 1857. At 
Lucknow, in northern India, the English were almost overcome. The town, 
defended by a garrison of: only 1720 men, who were protecting many 
women and children, was besieged by a greatly superior number. The 
defense, nevertheless, was maintained from the 30th of June to the 26th of 
September, when the relief column under the Scottish general, Sir Henry 
Havelock, preceded by the music of the bagpipes, reached the city.

SPANISH WATERS 
JOHN MASEFIELD 
Spanish waters, Spanish waters, you are ringing in my ears, 
Like a slow sweet piece of music from the gray forgotten years; 
Telling tales, and beating tunes, and bringing weary thought to mi 
Of the sandy beach at Muertos, where I would that I could be. 
There’s a surf breaks on Los Muertos, and it never stops to roar, 
And it’s there we came to anchor, and it’s there we went ashore, 
Where the blue lagoon is silent amid snags of rotting trees, 
Dropping like the clothes of corpses cast up by the seas. 
We anchored at Los Muertos when the dipping sun was red, 
We left her half-a-mile to sea, to west of Nigger Head; 
And before the mist was on the Cay, before the day was done, 
We were all ashore on Muertos with the gold that we had won.

Spanish Waters 185 le Ala 
We bore it through the marshes in a half-score battered chests, 
Sinking, in the sucking quagmires, to the sunburn on our breasts, 
The moon came white and ghostly as we laid the treasure down, 
There was gear there’d make a beggarman as rich as Lima Town, o Heaving over tree-trunks, gasping, damning at the flies and heat, 
Longing for a long drink, out of silver, in the ship’s cool lazareet. 
Copper charms and silver trinkets from the chests of Spanish 
crews, 
Gold doubloons and double moydores, louis d’ors and. ortagues. 
Clumsy yellow-metal earrings from the Indians of Brazil, 
2» Uncut emeralds out of Rio, bezoar stone from Guayaquil, 
Silver, in the crude and fashioned, pots of old Arica bronze, 
Jewels from the bones of Incas desecrated by the Dons. 
We smoothed the place with mattocks, and we took and blazed 
the tree, 
Which marks yon where the gear is hid that none will ever see, 
And we laid aboard the ship again, and south away we steers, 
Through the loud surf of Los Muertos which is beating in my ears.

It's not the way to end it all. I’m old and nearly blind, 
And an old man’s past’s a strange thing, for it never leaves his

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Biography. John Masefield (1875- —) is an English poet and play- 
wright. When a small boy he had a mania for running away from home; to 
satisfy this longing his father sent him to sea when he was fourteen years 
old, in charge of the captain of a sailing vessel. During his travels he | 
collected much material which he afterward used in his poems. On one 
of his trips he landed in New York City, where he acquired considerable 
knowledge of American customs. Next to Kipling he is England’s greatest 
singer of her “Seven Seas and Five Oceans.” 
Early in 1916 Masefield came to the United States on a lecture tour 
which aroused much interest in him and his writings. During the recent 
World War he served in France in connection with the Red Cross. He 
also served in the campaign on the Gallipoli Peninsula and wrote a splendid 
account of that unfortunate undertaking.

SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE 
Men of the Twenty-first 
Up by the Chalk Pit Wood, 
Weak with our wounds and our thirst, 
Wanting our sleep and our food, 
After a day and a night— 
God, shall we ever forget! 
Beaten and broke in the fight, 
But sticking it—sticking it yet. 
Trying to hold the line, 
Fainting and spent and done, 
Always the thud and the whine, 
Always the yell of the Hun! 
Northumberland, Lancaster, York, 
Durham, and Somerset, 
Fighting alone, worn to the bone, 
But sticking it—sticking it yet. 
Never a message of hope! 
Never a word of cheer! 
Fronting Hill 70’s shell-swept slope, 
With the dull dead plain in our rear. 
Always the whine of the shell, 
Always the roar of its burst, 
Always the tortures of hell, 
As waiting and wincing we cursed 
Our luck and the guns and the Boche, 
When our Corporal shouted, “Stand to!” 
And I heard someone cry, “Clear the front for the Guards! 
And-the Guards came through.

Our throats they were parched and hot, 
But Lord, if you’d heard the cheers!

Two brigades, if you please, 
Dressing as straight as a hem, 
We—we were down on our knees, 
Praying for us and for them!

But how could you understand! 
How should your cheeks be wet, 
Such feelin’s don’t come to you. 
But when can we or my mates forget, 
When the Guards came through? 
“Five yards left extend!” 
It passed from rank to rank. 
Line after line with never a bend, 
And a touch of the London swank, 
A trifle of swank and dash, 
Cool as a home parade, 
Twinkle and glitter and flash, 
Flinching never a shade, | 
With the shrapnel right in their face 
Doing their Hyde Park stunt, 
Keeping their swing at an easy pace, 
Arms at the trail, eyes front! 
Man, it was great to see! 
Man, it was fine to do! 
It’s a cot and a hospital ward for me,

How the Guards came through.

STORIES OF THE SEA 
  A DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTROM 
EDGAR ALLAN POE 
MY FIRST VIEW OF THE MAELSTROM 
We had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag. For 
sme minutes the old man seemed too much exhausted tc 
oeak. 
“Not long ago,” said he at length, “and I could have guided 
ou on this route as well as the youngest of my sons; but, about 
hree years past, there happened to me an event such as never 
appened before to mortal man—or at least such as no man ever 
urvived to tell of—and the six hours of deadly terror which I 
hen endured have broken me up, body and soul. You suppose 
ev ine a very old man—but I am not. It took less than a single day 
to change these hairs from a jetty black to white; to weaken my 
limbs, and to unstring my nerves, so that I tremble at the least 
exertion, and am frightened at a shadow. Do you know I can 
scarcely look over this little cliff without getting giddy?” 
The “little cliff,” upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown 
himself down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung 
over it, while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his 
491 ———
-P-A-G-E-209
  192 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
  elbow on its extreme and slippery edge—this “little cliff” arose, 
a sheer unobstructed precipice of black shining rock, some fifteen 
or sixteen hundred feet from the world of crags beneath us. 
Nothing would have tempted me to within half a dozen yards of 
5 its brink. In truth, so deeply was I excited by the perilous posi- 
tion of my companion, that I fell at full length upon the ground, 
clung to the shrubs around me, and dared not even glance upward 
at the sky—while I struggled in vain to divest myself of the idea 
that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger from | 
ao the fury of the winds. It was long before I could reason myself” 
into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the distance. 
“You must get over these fancies,” said the guide, “for I nave 
brought you here.that you might have the best possible view of 
the scene of that event I mentiohed—and to tell you the whole 
1s story with the spot just under your eye. | 
“We are now,” he continued, in that particularizing manner 
which distinguished him-—‘‘we are now close upon the Norwegian 
coast—in the sixty-eighth degree of latitude—in the great prov- 
ince of Nordiand—and in the dreary district of Lofoden. The 
20 mountain upon whose top we sit is Helseggen, the Cloudy. Now 
raise yourself up a little higher—hold on to the grass if you feel 
giddy—_so—and look out, beyond the belt of vapor beneath us, 
into the sea.” 
I looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whos 
25 waters wore so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the 
Nubian geographer’s account of the Mare Tenebrarum. A pano- 
rama more deplorably desolate no human imagination ca~ --~ 
ceive. To the right and left, as far as the eye could reacl: 
lay outstretched, like ramparts of the world, lines of h 
so black and beetling cliff, whose character of gloom was *--* *+ 
more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high uj 
it, its white and ghastly crest, howling and shrieking fore: 
opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were pla 
at a distance of some five or six miles out at sea, there wi... 
35a small, bleak-looking island; or, more properly, its position wat 
discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was envel

  oped. About two miles nearer the land arese another of smaller 
size, hideously craggy and barren, and encompassed at various 
intervals by a cluster of dark rocks. 
The appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more 
5 distant island and the shore, had something very unusual about it. 
Although, at the time, so strong a gale was blowing landward 
that a brig in the remote offing lay to under a double-reefed try- 
sail, and constantly plunged her whole hull out of sight, still there 
was here nothing like a regular swell, but only a short, quick, 
1» angry cross-dashing of water in every direction—as well in the 
teeth of the wind as otherwise. Of foam there was little except 
in the immediate vicinity of the rocks. , 
“The island in the distance,” resumed the old man, “is called 
by the Norwegians Vurrgh. The one midway is Moskoe. That 
15 a mile to the northward is Ambaaren. Yonder are Ifiesen, Hoey- 
*  ““ieldholm, Suarven, and Buckholm. Farther off—between 
and Vurrgh—are Otterholm, Flimen, Sandfiesen, and 
m. These are the true names of the places—but why it 
m thought necessary to name them at all is more than 
ou or I can understand. Do you hear anything? Do you 
change in the water?” 
iad now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen, 
h we had ascended from the interior of Lofoden, so that 
caught no glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us 
e summit. As the old man spoke, I became aware of a 
d gradually increasing sound, like the moaning of a vast 
buffaloes upon an American prairie; and at the same 
i Tperceived that what seamen term the chopping character 
cean beneath us, was rapidly changing into a current which 
ov w ude eastward. Even while I gazed, this current acquired a 
monstrous velocity. Each moment added to its speed—to its 
headlong impetuosity. In five minutes the whole sea, as far as 
Vurrgh, was lashed into ungovernable fury; but it was between 
Moskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway. Here 
the vast bed of the waters, seamed and scarred inte a thousand 
conflicting channels, burst suddenly into frenzied convilsion— LL, 18 :
-P-A-G-E-211
    194 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
heaving, boiling, hissing—gyrating in gigantic and innumerable 
vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to the eastward with 
a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes, except in pre- 
cipitous descents. 
5 In a few minutes more, there came over the scene another 
radical alteration, The general surface grew somewhat more- 
smooth, and the whirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while pro- 
digious streaks of foam became apparent where none had been 
seen before. These streaks, at length, spreading out to a great 
w distance, and entering into combination, took unto themselves 
the gyratory motion of the subsided vortices, and seemed to 
form the germ of another more vast. Suddenly—very suddenly— 
this assumed a distinct and definite existence, in a circle of more 
than a mile in diameter. The edge of the whirl was represented 
18 by a broad belt of gleaming spray; but no particle of this slipped 
into the mouth of the terrific funnel, whose interior, as far as the 
eye could fathom it, was a smooth, shining, and jet-black wall of 
water, inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty-five 
degrees, speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and 
20 sweltering motion, and sending forth to the winds an appalling 
voice, half shriek, half roar, such as not even the mighty cataract 
of Niagara ever lifts up in its agony to Heaven. 
The mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked. 
I threw myself upon my face, and clung to the scant herbage in 
25 an excess of nervous agitation. 
“This,” said I at length, to the old man—“this can be nothing 
else than the great whirlpool of the Maelstrom.” 
“So it is sometimes termed,” said he. “We Norwegians call it 
the Moskoe-strom, from the island of Moskoe in the midway.” 
i) The ordinary aceounts of this vortex had by no means pre- 
pared me for what I saw. That of Jonas Ramus, which is perhaps 
the most circumstantial of any, cannot impart the faintest con- 
ception eithér of the magnificence or of the horror of the scene— 
or of the wild bewildering sense of the novel which confounds the 
35 beholder. I am not sure from what point of view the writer in 
question surveyed it, nor at what time; but it could neither have 
been from the summit of Helseggen, nor during a storm. There
-P-A-G-E-212
A Descent into the Maelstrom 195 
  are some passages of his description, nevertheless, which may be 
quoted for their details, although their effect is exceedingly feeble 
in conveying an impression of the spectacle. 
“Between Lofoden and Moskoe,” he says, “the depth of the 
5 water is between thirty-six and forty fathoms; but on the other 
side, toward Ver (Vurrgh), this depth decreases so as not to afford 
a convenient passage for a vessel, without the risk of splitting on 
the rocks, which happens even in the calmest weather. When it 
is flood, the stream runs up the country between Lofoden and 
10 Moskoe with a boisterous rapidity; but the roar of its impetuous” 
ebb to the sea is scarce equaled by the loudest and most dreadful 
cataracts, the noise being heard several leagues off; and the vor- 
tices or pits are of such an extent and depth, that if a ship comes 
within its attraction, it is inevitably absorbed and carried down 
18 to the bottom, and there beat to pieces against the rocks; and 
when the water relaxes, the fragments thereof are thrown up again. 
But these intervals of tranquillity are only at the turn of the 
ebb and flood, and in calm weather, and last but a quarter of an 
hour, its violence gradually returning. When the stream is most 
20 boisterous, and its fury heightened by a storm, it is dangerous to 
come within a Norwegian mile of it. Boats, yachts, and ships 
have been carried away by not guarding against it before they 
were within its reach. It likewise happens frequently that whales 
come too near the stream, and are overpowered by its violence; 
25 and then it is impossible to describe their howlings and bellowings 
in their fruitless struggles to disengage themselves. A bear once, 
attempting to swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by the 
stream and borne down, while he roared terribly, so as to be 
heard on shore. Large stocks of firs and pine trees, after being 
30 absorbed by the current, rise again broken and torn to such a 
degree as if bristles grew upon them. This plainly shows the 
bottom to consist of craggy rocks, among which they are whirled 
to and fro. This stream is regulated by the flux and reflux of the 
sea—it being constantly high and low water every six hours. 
35 In the year 1645, early in the morning of Sexagesima Sunday, it 
| raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very ‘stones of 
—_ 
the houses on the coast fell to the ground.”
-P-A-G-E-213
  
196 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
In regard to-the depth of the water, I could not see how this 
could have been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of 
the vortex. The “forty fathoms” must have reference only to 
portions of the channel close upon the shore either of Moskoe or 
5 Lofoden. The depth in the center of the Moskoe-strom must be 
immeasurably greater; and no better proof.of this fact is neces- 
sary than can be obtained from even the sidelong glance into the 
abyss of the whirl which may be had from the highest crag of 
Helseggen. Looking down from this pinnacle upon the howling 
10 Phiegethon below, I could not help smiling at the simplicity with 
which the honest Jonas Ramus records, as a matter difficult of 
belief, the anecdotes of the whales and the bears; for it appeared 
to me, in fact, a self-evident thing that the largest ships of the 
line in existence, coming within the influence of that deadly 
4s attraction, could resist it as little as a feather the hurricane, and 
must disappear bodily and at once. 
The attempts to account for the phenomenon—some of which, 
I remember, seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal—now 
wore a very different and unsatisfactory aspect. The idea gener- 
20 ally received is that this, as well as three smaller vortices among 
the Faroe Islands, “have no other cause than the collision of 
waves rising and falling, at flux and reflux, against a ridge of rocks 
and shelves, which confines the water so that it precipitates itself 
like a cataract; and thus the higher the flood rises, the deeper 
25 must the fall be, and the natural result of all is a whirlpool or 
vortex, the prodigious suction of which is sufficiently known by 
lesser experiments.”—These are the words of the Encyclopedia 
Britannica. Kircher and others imagine that in the center of 
the channel of the Maelstrom is an abyss penetrating the globe, 
30 and issuing in some very remote part—the Gulf of Bothnia being 
somewhat -decidedly named in one instance, This opinion, idle 
in itself, was the one to which, as I gazed, my imagination most 
readily assented; and, mentioning it to the guide, I wa: : 
surprised to hear him say that, although it was the view 
35 universally entertained of the subject by the Norwegians, 11 
nevertheless was not his own. As to the former notion he con- 
fessed his inability to comprehend it; and here I agreed with
-P-A-G-E-214

  him—for, however conclusive on paper, it becomes altogether 
| unintelligible, and even absurd, amid the thunder of the abyss. 
THE GUIDE'S MARVELOUS TALE 
“You have had a good look at the whirl now,” said the old 
man, “and if you will creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee, 
s and deaden the roar of the water, I will tell you a story that will 
, convince you I ought to know something of the Moskoe-strom.” 
I placed myself as desired, and he proceeded. , ‘ 
“Myself'and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged 
smack of about seventy tons burden, with which we were in the 
whabit of fishing among the islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to 
Vurrgh. In all violent eddies at sea there is good fishing, at 
proper opportunities, if one has only the courage to attempt it; 
| but among the whole of the Lofoden coastmen we three were 
the only ones who made a regular business of going out to the 
wislands, as I tell you. The usual grounds are a great way lower 
down to the southward. There fish can be got at all hours, with- 
out much risk, and therefore these places are preferred. The 
choice spots over here among the rocks, however, not only yield 
the finest variety, but in far greater abundance; so that we often 
j% got in a single day what the more timid of the craft could not 
serape together in a week. In fact, we made it a matter of 
desperate speculation—the risk of life standing instead of labor, 
and courage answering for capital. ' . 
“We kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the 
% coast than this; and it was our practice, in fine weather, to take 
| advantage of the fifteen minutes’ slack to push across the main 
channel of the Moskoe-strom, far above the pool, and then drop 
down upon anchorage somewhere near Otterholm, or Sandflesen, 
where the eddies are not so violent as elsewhere. Here we used 
t0 to remain until nearly time for slack water again, when we weighed 
and made for home. We never set out upon this expedition with- 
out a steady side wind for going and coming—one that we felt 
sure would not fail us before our return—and we seldom made a 
miscalculation upon this point. Twice, during six years, we were 
% forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead calm, which 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
    
198 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
is a rare thing indeed just about here; and once we had to remain 
on the ground nearly a week, starving to death, owing to a gale 
which blew up shortly after our arrival, and made the channel 
too boisterous to be thought of. Upon this occasion we should 
s have been driven out to sea in spite of everything (for the whirl- 
pools threw us round and round so violently that, at length, we 
fouled our anchor and dragged it) if it had not been that we 
drifted into one of the innumerable cross currents—here today 
and gone tomorrow—which drove us under the lee of Flimen, 
10 where, by good luck, we brought up. 
“T could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we 
encountered ‘on the ground’—it is a bad spot to be in, even in 
good weather—but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of 
the Moskoe-strom itself without accident; although at times my 
‘15 heart has been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute 
or so behind or before the slack. The wind sometimes was not as 
strong as we thought it at starting, and then we made rather less 
way than we could wish, while the current rendered the smack 
unmanageable. My eldest brother had a son eighteen years old, 
20 and I had two stout boys of my own. These would have been 
of great assistance at such times, in using the sweeps, as well as 
afterward in fishing—but, somehow, although we ran the risk 
ourselves, we had not the heart to let the young ones get into the 
danger—for, after all said and done, it was a horrible danger, and 
26 that is the truth. 
“It is now within a few days of three years since what I am 
going to tell you occurred. It was on the tenth of July, 18—, a 
day which the people of this part of the world will never forget— 
for it was one in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever 
30 came out of the heavens. And yet all the morning, and indeed 
until late in the afternoon, there was a gentle and steady breeze 
from the southwest, while the sun shone brightly, so that the 
oldest seaman among us could not have foreseen what was to 
follow. 
3s “The three of us—my two brothers and myself—had crossed 
over to the islands about two o’clock P.m., and soon nearly loaded 
. the smack with fine fish, which, we all remarked, were more plenty
-P-A-G-E-216

that day than we had ever known them. It was just seven, by my 
watch, when we weighed and started for home, so as to make 
the worst of the Strom at slack water, which we knew would be 
at eight. . 
s “We set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter, and 
for some time spanked along at a great rate, never dreaming of 
danger, for indeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend ‘it. 
All at once we were taken aback by a breeze from over Helseggen. 
This was most unusual—something that had never happened to 
ious before—and I began to feel a little uneasy, without exactly 
knowing why. We put the boat on the wind, but could make no 
headway at all for the eddies, and I was upon the point of pro-. 
posing to return to the anchorage, when, looking astern, we saw 
the whole horizon covered with a singular copper-covered cloud 
| 1s that rose with the most amazing velocity. 
“In the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away, 
and we were dead becalmed, drifting about in every direction. 
This state of things, however, did not last long enough to give 
us time to think about it. In less than a minute the storm was 
} 20 upon us—in less than two the sky was entirely overcast—and 
what with this and the driving spray, it became suddenly so dark 
that we could not see each other in the smack. 
“Such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describ- 
ing, The oldest seaman in Norway never experienced anything 
25 like it. We had let our sails go by the run before it cleverly 
took us; but, at the first puff, both our.masts went by the board 
as if they had been sawed off—the mainmast taking with it my 
youngest brother, who had lashed himself to it for safety. 
“Our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that. ever sat 
30 upon water. It had a complete flush deck, with only a small 
hateh near the bow, and this hatch it had always been our 
custom to batten down when about to cross the Strom, by way 
of precaution against the chopping seas. But for this circum- 
tance we should have foundered at once—for we lay entirely 
' 3 buried for some moments. How my elder brother escaped destruc- 
tion I cannot say, for I never had an opportunity of ascertaining, 
| = my: part, as soon as I had let the foresail run, I threw myself

flat on deck, with my feet against the narrow gunwale of the 
bow, and with my hands grasping a ringbolt near the foot of 
the feremast. It was mere instinct that prompted me to do 
this—which was undoubtedly the very best thing I could have 
s done—for I was teo much flurried to think. 
SWEPT INTO THE MAELSTROM 
“For some moments we were completely deluged, as I say, and 
all this time I held my breath, and clung to the bolt. When I 
could stand it no longer I raised myself upon my knees, still 
keeping hold with my hands, and thus got my head clear. 
1o Presently our little boat gave herself a shake, just as a dog 
does in coming out of the water, and thus rid herself, in some 
measure, of the seas. I was now trying to get the better of the 
stupor that had come over me, and to collect my senses so as to 
see what was to be done, when I felt somebody grasp my arm. 
1s It was my elder brother, and my heart leaped for joy, for I 
had made sure that he was overboard—but the next moment all 
this joy was turned into horror—for he put his mouth close to 
my ear, and screamed out the word ‘Moskoe-strom!’ 
“No one will ever know what my feelings were at that moment. 
20 I shook from head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit 
of the ague. I knew what he meant by that one word well 
enough—I knew what he wished to make me understand. With 
the wind that now drove us on, we were bound for the whirl of 
the Strom, and nothing could save us! 
25 “You perceive that in crossing the Strom channe! 
went a long way up above the whirl, even in the calm 
and then had to wait and watch carefully for the 
now we were driving right upon the pool itself, an: 
hurricane as this! ‘To be sure,’ I thought, ‘we shz 
30 just about the slack—there is some little hope in tl 
the next moment I cursed myself for being so great 
dream of hope at all. I knew very well that we w 
had we been ten times a ninety-gun ship. 
“By this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself, 
88 or perhaps we did not feel it so much as we scudded before it;

k < 
' but at’ all events the seas, which at first had been kept down 
| by the wind, and lay flat and frothing, now got up into absolute 
mountains. A singular change, too, had come over the heavens. 
Around in every direction it was still black as pitch, but nearly 
soverhead there burst out, all at once, a circular rift of clear 
sky—as clear as I ever saw—and of a deep bright blue—and 
through it there blazed forth the full moon with a luster that I 
never before knew her to wear. She lit up everything about us. 
| with the greatest distinctness—but, oh, God, what a scene it was. 
1 to light up! 
“T now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother— 
| but, in some manner which I could not understand, the din had. 
4 so increased that I could not make him hear a single word, 
| although I screamed at the top of my voice in his ear. Presently 
\* he shook his head, looking as pale as death, and held up one of 
his fingers, as if to say listen! 
“At first I could not make out what he meant—but soon a 
hideous thought flashed upon me. I dragged my watch from its: 
fob. It was not going. I glanced at its face by the moonlight, 
* and then burst. into tears as I flung it far away into the ocean.. 
It had run down at seven o’clock! We were behind the time of 
the slack, and the wharl of the Strom was in full fury! 
“When a boat is well built, properly trimmed, and not deep. 
laden, the waves in a strong gale, when she is going large, seem 
s always to slip from beneath her—which appears very strange to- 
a landsman—and this is what is called riding, in sea phrase. 
“Well, so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly; but- 
|) presently a gigantic sea happened to take us right under the 
counter, and -bore us with it as it rose—up—up—as if inte the- 
0 he sky. I would not have believed that any wave could rise se high. 
And then down we came with a sweep, a slide, and a plunge, that. 
made me feel sick and dizzy, as if I was falling from seme lofty 
mountain-top in a dream. But while we were up I had thrown. 
a quick glance around—and that one glance was all-sufficient. 
I saw our exact position in an instant. The Moskoe-strom whirl-. 
pool was about a quarter of a mile dead ahead—but no more: 
like the everyday Moskoe-strom than the whirl as you now see: | 
     
-P-A-G-E-219
  202 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
it is like a mill-race. If I had not known where we were, and 
what we had to expect, I should not have recognized the place 
at all. As it was, I involuntarily closed my eyes in horror. The 
lids clenched themselves together as if in a spasm. 
“Tt could not have been more than two minutes afterwards 
until we suddenly felt the waves subside, and were enveloped 
in foam. The boat made a sharp half turn to larboard, and then 
shot off in its new direction like a thunderbolt. At the same 
moment the roaring noise of the water was completely drowned 
10 in a kind of shrill shriek—such a sound as you might imagine 
given out by the water-pipes of many thousand steam vessels, 
letting off their steam all together. We were now in the belt of 
surf that always surrounds the whirl; and I thought, of course, 
that another moment would plunge us into the abyss—down 
4s which we could only see indistinctly on account of the amazing 
velocity with which we were borne along. The boat did net coom 
to sink into the water at all, but to skim like an air-bubb!| 
the surface of the surge. Her starboard side was next th: 
and on the larboard arose the world of ocean we hadi 
20 stood like a huge, writhing wall between us and the horizon. 
“Tt may appear strange, but now, when we were in **- ~~ 
jaws of the gulf, I felt more composed than when we ' 
approaching it. Having made up my mind to hope n. 
got rid of a great deal of that terror which unmanned r 
26 I suppose it was despair that strung my nerves. 
“Tt may look like boasting—but what I tell you i: 
began to’ reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die su. own a 
manner, and how foolish it was in-me to think of so paltry a con- 
sideration as my own individual life, in view of so won’ * * 
:30 manifestation of God’s power. I do believe that I blusi 
shame when this idea crossed my mind. After a little 
became possessed with the keenest curiosity about tl 
itself. I positively felt a wish to explore its depths, eve 
sacrifice I was going to make; and my principal grief 1 
33 I should never be able to tell my old companions on sho 
the mysteries I should see. These, no doubt, were singula 
to occupy a man’s mind in such extremity—and I ha o
-P-A-G-E-220
    
thought since, that the revolutions of the boat around the pool 
might have rendered me a little light-headed. 
“There was another circumstance which tended to restore my 
self-possession; and this was the cessation of the wind, which 
scould not reach us in our present situation—for, as you saw 
yourself, the belt: of surf is considerably lower than the general 
bed of the ocean, and this latter now towered above us, a high, 
black, mountainous ridge. If you have never been at sea in a 
heavy gale, you can form no idea of the confusion of mind 
w occasioned by the wind and spray together. They blind, deafen, 
; and strangle you, and take away all power of action or reflec- 
tion. But we were now, in a great measure, rid of these annoy- 
| ances—just as death-condemned felons in prisons are allowed 
petty indulgences forbidden them while their doom is yet uncer- 
1s tain. 
“How often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible 
} to say. We careered round and round for perhaps an hour, 
flying rather than floating, getting gradually more and more into 
the middle of the surge, and then nearer and nearer to its hor- 
~ rible inner edge. All this time I had never let go of the ringbolt. 
My brother was at the stern, holding on to a small empty water- 
cask which had been securely lashed under the coop of the 
counter, and was the only thing on deck that had not been swept 
overboard when the gale first took us. As we approached the 
3 brink of the pit he let go his hold upon this, and made for the 
ring, from which, in the agony of his terror, he endeavored to 
force my hands, as it was not large enough to afford us both a 
secure grasp. I never felt deeper grief than when I saw him 
attempt this act—although I knew he was a madman when he 
\w did it—a raving maniac through sheer fright. I did not care, 
however, to contest the point with him. I knew it could make 
no difference whether either of us held on at all; so I let him 
have the bolt, and went astern to the cask. This there was no 
great difficulty in doing; for the smack flew round steadily enough, 
"3% and upon an even keel—only swaying to and fre, with the 
|| immense sweeps and swelters of the whirl. Scarcely had I 
| secured myself in my new position, when we gave a wild lurch | A Descent into the Maelstrom 202

  _ to starboard, and rushed headlong into the abyss. I muttered a 
hurried prayer to God, and thought all was over. ~ 
“Ag I felt the sickening sweep of the descent, I had instinc- 
tively tightened my hold upon the barrel, and closed my eyes. 
s For some seconds I dared not open them—while I expected 
instant destruction, and wondered that I was not already in my 
death-struggles with the water. But moment after moment 
elapsed. I still lived. The sense of falling had ceased; and the 
motion of the vessel seemed much as it had been before, while 
10 in the belt of foam, with the exception that she now lay more 
along. I took courage and looked once again upon the scene. 
“Never shall I forget the sensations of awe, he---~ --7 
admiration with which I gazed about me. The boat

forth, as the rays of the full moon, from that circulas 
20 the clouds which I have already described, streamed 
of golden glory along the black walls, and far away

rately. The general burst of terrific grandeur was al! +h-~+

forty-five degrees, so that we seemed to be lying u

scarcely more difficulty in maintaining my hold and fc |

35 I suppose, was owing to the speed at which we revolved

oped, and over which there hung a magnificent rainbow, like that 
narrow and tottering bridge which Mussulmans say is the only 
pathway between Time and Eternity. This mist, or spray, was 
sno doubt occasioned by the.clashing of the great walls of the 
funnel, as they all met together at the bottom—but the yell that 
went up to the heavens from out of that mist, I dare not attempt 
to describe. 
“Our first slide into the abyss itself, from the belt of foam 
‘wabove, had carried us to a great distance down the slope; but _ 
' our farther descent was by no means proportionate. Round and 
round we swept—-not with any uniform movement, but in dizzy- 
| ing swings and jerks, that sent us sometimes only a few hundred 
yards—-sometimes nearly the complete circuit of the whirl, Our 
progress downward, at each revolution, was slow, but very 
perceptible. | on account of a thick mist in which everything there was envel- 
THE MARVELOUS ESCAPE 
“Looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on 
which we were thus borne, I perceived that our boat was not the 
| only object in the embrace of the whirl. Both above and below 
us were visible fragments of vessels, large masses of building 
timber and trunks of trees, with many smaller articles, such as 
pieces of house furniture, breken boxes, barrels, and staves. I 
have already described the unnatural curiosity which had taken 
the place of my original terrors. It appeared to grow upon me 
*s as I drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom. I now began. 
to watch, with a strange interest, the numerous things that floated 
in our company. I must have been delirious—for I even sought. 
\ amusement in speculating upon the relative velocities of their 
several descents toward the foam below. ‘This fir tree,’ I found 
ts myself at one time saying, ‘will certainly be the next thing that 
takes the awful plunge and disappears,—and then I was dis- 
appointed to find that the wreck of a Dutch merchant ship over- 
‘ook it and went down before. At length, after making several 
esses of this nature, and being deceived in all—this fact— 
he fact of my invariable miscalculation, set me upon a train of 
ee
-P-A-G-E-223
oi   
206 Junior High School Literature, Book One   
reflection that made my limbs again tremble, and my heart beat 
heavily once more. , 
“Tt was not a new terror that thus affected me, but the dawn 
of a more exciting hope. This hope arose partly from memory, 
s and partly from present observation. I called to mind the great 
variety of buoyant matter that strewed the coast of Lofoden, 
having been absorbed and then thrown forth by the Moskoe- 
strom. By far the greater number of the articles were shattered 
in the most extraordinary way—so chafed and roughened as to 
io have the appearance of being stuck full of splinters—but then 
I distinctly recollected that there were some of them which were 
not disfigured at all. Now I could not account for this differ- 
ence except by supposing that the roughened fragments were the 
only ones which had been completely absorbed—that the others 
1s had entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide, or, from 
some reason, had descended so slowly after entering, that they 
did not reach the bottom before the turn of the flood came, or 
of the ebb, as the case might be. I conceived it possible, in 
either instance, that they might thus be whirled up again to the 
20 level of the ocean, without undergoing the fate of those which 
had been drawn in more early or absorbed more rapidly. I made, 
also, three important observations. The first was, that as a 
general rule, the larger the bodies were, the more rapid their 
descent; the second, that, between two masses of equal extent, 
25 the one spherical, and the other of any other shape, the supe- 
riority in speed of descent was with the sphere; the third, that, 
between two masses of equal size, the one cylindrical, and the 
other of any other shape, the cylinder was absorbed the more 
slowly. Simce my escape, I have had several conversations on 
30 this subject with an old schoolmaster of the district; and it was 
from him that I learned the use of the words ‘cylinder’ and 
‘sphere.’ He explained to me—although I have forgotten the 
explanation—how what I observed was, in fact, the natural con- 
sequence of the forms of the floating fragments, and showed me 
36 how it happened that a cylinder, swimming in a vortex, offered 
more resistance to its suction, and was drawn in with greater 
difficulty, than an equally bulky body, of any form whatever.

“There was one startling circumstance which went a great 
way in enforcing these observations, and rendering me anxious 
to turn them to account, and this was that, at every revolution, 
we passed something like a barrel, or else the yard or mast of 
sa vessel, while many of these things, which had been on our 
level when I first opened my eyes upon the wonders of the 
whirlpool, were now high up above us, and seemed to have moved 
but little from their original station. 
“T no longer hesitated what to do. I resolved- to lash myself 
1 securely to the water cask upon which I now held, to cut it 
loose from the counter, and to throw myself with it into the 
water. I attracted my brother’s attention to signs, pointed to 
the floating barrels that came near us, and did everything in 
my power to make him understand what I was about to do. I 
15 thought at length that he comprehended my design—but, whether 
this was the case or not, he shook his head despairingly, and 
refused to move from his station by the ringbolt. It was impos- 
sible to reach him; the emergency admitted of no delay; and so, 
with a bitter struggle, I resigned him to his fate, fastened myself 
20 to the cask by means of the lashings which secured it to the 
counter, and precipitated myself with it into the sea, without 
another moment’s hesitation. 
“The result was precisely what I had hoped it might be. 
As it is myself who now tells you this tale—as you see that I 
25 did escape—and as you are already in possession of the mode 
in which this escape was effected, and must therefore anticipate 
all that I have further to say—I will bring my story quickly to 
conclusion. It might have been an hour, or thereabout, after 
my quitting the smack, when, having descended to a vast dis- 
20 tance beneath me, it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid 
succession, and, bearing my loved brother with it, plunged head- 
long, at once and forever, into the chaos of foam below. The 
barrel to which I was attached sunk very little farther than 
half the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the spot 
~~ at which I leaped overboard, before a great change took place 
in the character of the whirlpool. The slope of the sides of the 
vast funnel became momently less and less steep. The gyrations

of the whirl grew, gradually, less and less violent. Bi 
the froth and the rainbow disappeared, and the bottc 
gulf seemed slowly to uprise. The sky was clear, the » 
gone down, and the full moon was setting radiantly in

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Biography. Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) was the greatest poet an 
short story writer the South has produced. His parents belonged b: 
profession to the stage; his mother was English and his father Americas 
by birth. Born in Boston, he was left an orphan at an early age, and wa 
adopted by a Mr. Allan, a wealthy citizen of Richmond, Virginia. 
sent to schoo! in London, and later he attended the University o | 
and the military academy at West Point. Mr. Allan lavished n =) __. 
- other inducements upon him in vain efforts to get him to settle down to | 
permanent profession, but finally abandoned him to his own resource: 
From that time on, Poe eked out a living by publishing poems a: 
by contributions to newspapers and magazines, and by editorial w« 
he was too erratic in his habits to retain long either positions 01 
His writings, like his character, were weird, mysterious, haunted by L.vcuu 
melancholy. But his poetry is perhaps the most purely musical of any i 
our language—-for Poe believed that poetry should be the language of th

  feelings rather than of thought, and that it should therefore seek to ‘produce 
its effects through “harmony of sweet sounds” rather than through the mean- 
ing of its lmes. His prose tales of mystery and adventure are rémarkable 
for their imaginative and poetic style; they have served as models for many 
well known writers. Poe was the originator of the modern short story. 
Poe’s erratic, troubled life ended at Baltimore, in 1849, in the fortieth 
year of his age. The pathos of it is well summed up in the inscription on 
a memorial tablet erected to him in the New York Museum of Art: “He 
was great in his genius, unhappy in his life, wretched in his death, but in 
his fame, immortal.”

me, and I was doing it. Consequently, gold in California was 1 
business of mine. 
But, by the time when I came home to England again, tl

thing was as clear as your hand held up before you at noon-day. 
There was Californian gold in the museums and in the goldsmiths’ _ 
shops, and the very first time I went upon ’Change, I met a friend 
of mine (a seafaring man like myself), with a Californian nugget 
s hanging to his watch-chain. I handled it. It was as like a peeled 
walnut with bits unevenly broken off here and there, and then 
electrotyped all over, as ever I saw anything in my life. 
Iam a single man (she was too good for this world and for 
, me, and she died six weeks before our marriage-day), so when I 
‘iam ashore, I live in my house at Poplar. My house at Poplar 
' is taken care of and kept ship-shape by an old lady who was my 
' mother’s maid before I was born. She is as handsome and as 
upright as any old lady in the world. She is as fond of me as if 
she had ever had an only son, and I were he. Well do I know 
15 wherever I sail that she never lays down her head at night with- 
out having said, “Merciful Lord! bless and preserve William 
George Ravender, and send him safe home, through Christ our 
Savior!” I have thought of it in many a dangerous moment, 
when it has done me no harm, I am sure. 
\o Inmy house at Poplar, along with this old lady, I lived quiet 
for the best part.of a year, having had a long spell of it among the 
Islands, and having (which was very uncommon in me) taken 
the fever rather badly. At last, being strong and hearty, and hav- 
ing read every book I could lay hold of right out, I was walking 
5 down Leadenhall Street in the City of London, thinking of turn- 
ing-to again, when I met what I.call Smithick and Watersby of 
Liverpool. I chanced to lift up my eyes from looking in at a 
ship’s chronometer in a window, and I saw him bearing down 
upon me, head on. 
|» It is, personally, neither Smithick, nor Watersby, that I here 
mention, nor was I ever acquainted with any man of either of 
those names, nor do I think that there has been any one of either 
of those names in that Liverpool House for years back. But, it 
is in reality the House itself that I refer to; and a wiser merchant 
\% or a truer gentleman never stepped. 
“My dear Captain Ravender,” says he. “Of all the men on 
earth, I wanted to see you most. I was on my way to you.”   
   
-P-A-G-E-229
212. Junior High School Literature, Book One 
“Welll” says I. “That looks as if you were to see me, don’t 
it?” With that I put my arm in his, and we walked on. toward 
‘the Royal Exchange, and when we got there, walked up and down 
at the back of it where the Clock-Tower is. We walked an hour 
s and more, for he had much to say to me. He had'a scheme for 
chartering a new ship of their own to take out cargo to the diggers 
and emigrants in California, and to buy and bring back goid. 
Into the particulars of that scheme I will not enter, and I have .0 
right to enter. All I say of it is, that it was a very original one, 
10 a very fine one, a very sound one, and a very lucrative one beyond 
doubt. 
He imparted it to me as freely as if I had been'a part of him- 
self. After doing so, he made me the handsomest sharing offer 
that ever was made to me, boy or man—or I believe to any other 
18 captain in the Merchant Navy—and he took this round turn to 
finish with: 
“Ravender, you are well aware that the lawlessness of that 
coast and country at present is as special as the circumstances 
in which it is placed. Crews of vessels outward bound desert 
20 as soon as they make the land; crews of vessels homeward bound, 
ship at enormous wages, with the express intention of murdering 
the captain and seizing the gold freight; no man can trust another, 
and the devil seems let loose. Now,” says he, “you know my 
opinion of you, and you know I am only expressing it, and with 
25 no singularity, when I tell you that you are almost the only man 
on whose integrity, discretion, and energy—” etc., ete. For, I 
don’t want to repeat what he said, though I was and am sensible 
of it. 
Notwithstanding my being, as I have mentioned, quite ready 
30 for a voyage, still I had some doubts of this voyage. ~~ 
I knew, without being told, that there were peculia: 
and dangers in it, a long way over and above those w 
all voyages. It must not be supposed that I was af) 
them; but, in my opinion a man has no manly motive 
38 ment in his own breast for facing dangers, unless he h: 
sidered what they are, and is quietly able to say to hin 
of these perils can now take me by surprise; I shall kuuw waau vw
-P-A-G-E-230

do for the best in any of them; all the rest lies in the higher and 
greater hands to which I humbly commit myself.” On this prin- 
ciple I have so attentively considered (regarding it as my duty) 
all the hazards I have ever been able to think of, in the ordinary 
5 way of storm, shipwreck, and fire at sea, that I hope I should be 
prepared to do in any of those cases whatever could be done, to 
save the lives entrusted to my charge. 
As I was thoughtful, my good friend proposed that he should 
leave me to walk there as long as I liked, and that I should dine 
2 with him by-and-by at his club in Pall Mall. I accepted the 
_ invitation and I walked up and down there, quarter-deck fashion, 
a matter of a couple of hours; now and then looking up at the 
weathercock as I might have looked up aloft; -and now and then 
taking a look into Cornhill, as I might have taken a look over 
1s the side. : 
All dinner-time, and all after dinner-time, we talked it over 
again. I gave him my views of his plan, and he very much 
approved of the same. I told him I had nearly decided, but not 
quite. “Well, well,” says he, “come down to Liverpool tomorrow 
+ with me, and see the Golden Mary.” I liked the name (her name 
was Mary, and she was golden, if golden stands for good), so I 
began to feel that it was almost done when I said I would go to 
Liverpool. On the next morning but one we were on board the 
Golden Mary. I might have known, from his asking me to come 
s down and see her, what she was. I declare her to have been the 
completest and most exquisite Beauty that ever I set my eyes 
upon. : 
We had inspected every timber in her, and had come back to 
the gangway to go ashore from the dock-basin, when I put out my 
30 hand to my friend. “Touch upon it,” says I, “and touch heartily. 
I take command of this ship and I am hers and yours, if I can 
get John Steadiman for my chief mate.” 
John Steadiman had sailed with me four voyages. The first 
voyage John was third mate out to China, and came home second. 
% The other three voyages he was my first officer. At this time of 
chartering the Golden Mary, he was aged thirty-two. A brisk, 
bright, blue-eyed fellow, a very neat figure and rather under the

pleased everybody and that all children took to, a habit of goin; 
about singing as checrily as a blackbird, and a perfect. sailor. 
We were in one of those Liverpool hack: 
than a minute, and we cruised about in her 
hours, looking for John. John had come home 
Land barely a month before, and I had heard 
frisk in Liverpool. We asked after him, among 
at the two boarding-houses he was fondest o! 
had had a week’s spell at each of them; but, he 
gone there, and had set off “to lay out on th 
yard of the highest Welsh mountain” (so he | 
of the house), and where he might be then, or Wes ae suague come 
back nobody could tell us. But it was surprising, to k 
see how every face brightened the moment there wa: 
made of the name of Mr. Steadiman. 
"We were taken aback at meeting with no better luck, and we 
had wore ship and put her head for my friend’s, when as we were 
jogging through the streets, I clap my eyes on John hir: 
ing out of a toy-shop! He was carrying a little boy, an: 
ing two uncommon pretty women to their coach, and he wiu me 
afterwards that he had never in his life seen one of the 
before, but that he was so taken with them on looking in

:ladies’ permission to treat him to a tolerably correct Cutte

Golden Mary was afloat.

Grass never grew yet under the feet of Smithick and Watersby. 
The riggers were out of that ship in a fortnight’s time, and we 
had begun taking in cargo. John was always aboard, seeing © 
everything stowed with his own eyes; and whenever I went aboard 
myself early or late, whether he was below in the hold, or on deck 
at the hatechway, or overhauling his cabin, nailing up pictures in 
it of the Blush Roses of England, the Blue Belles of Scotland, and 
the female Shamrock of Ireland, of a certainty I heard Jokn sing- 
ing like a blackbird. 
THE START FOR CALIFORNIA 
eg» rer 
We had room for twenty passengers. Our sailing advertise- 
j ment was no sooner out, than we might have taken these twenty 
times over. In entering our men, I and John (both together) 
picked them, and we entered none but good hands—as good as 
were to be found in that port. And so, in a good ship of the best 
build, well owned, well arranged, well officered, well manned, well 
fn in all respects, we parted with our pilot ata quarter past 
four o’clock in the afternoon of the seventh of March, one thou- 
sand eight hundred and fifty-one, and stood with a fair wind out 
to sea. 
It may be easily believed that up to that time I had had no 
leisure to be intimate with my passengers. The most of them were 
then in their berths seasick ; however, in going among them, telling 
.. them what was good for them, persuading them not to be there, 
. to come up on deck and feel the breeze, and in rousing them 
| 
  with a joke, or a comfortable word, I made acquaintance with 
them, perhaps, in a more friendly and confidential way from the 
first, than I might have done at the cabin table. 
Of my passengers, I need only particularize, just at present, 
a bright-eyed blooming young wife who was going out to join 
her husband in California, taking with her their only child, a little 
girl three years old, whom he had never seen; a sedate young 
woman in black, some five years older (about thirty as I should 
say), who was going out to jo a brother; and an old gentleman, 
agood deal like a hawk if his eyes had been better and not so red, 
who was always talking, morning, noon, and night, about the gold -

discovery. But, whether he was making the voyage, th 
old arms could dig for gold, or whether his speculation w 
it, or to barter for it, or to cheat for it, or to snatch i 
from other people, was his secret. He kept his secret. 
8s These three and the child were the soonest well. Thi 
a most engaging child, to be sure, and very fond of me 
am bound to admit that John Steadiman and I were be 
pretty little books in reverse order, and that he was car 
and I was mate. It was beautiful to watch her with Jr 
10 was beautiful to watch John with her. Few would ha 
it possible, to see John playing at Bo-peep round the

Malay and a Maltese dead, as they were gliding with ti 
down the cabin stair aboard the bark Old England,

him his back against a bulwark, he would have done tt 
half a dozen of them. The name of the young mothe 
Atherfield, the name of the young lady in black was lass. Uuie- 
shaw, and the name of the old gentleman was Mr. Rarx. 
20 As the child had a quantity of shining fair hair, « 
curls all around her face, and as her name was Lucy 
gave her the name of Golden Lucy. So, we had the 
and the Golden Mary; and John kept up the idea to th

used to think the ship was alive somehow—a sister 0! 
going to the same place as herself. She liked to be |: 
and in fine weather, I have often stood by the man v1 
was at the wheel, only to hear her, sitting near my 
to the ship. Never had a child such a doll before, I

Of course I took charge of the two young women, a1 
38 them “my dear,” and they never minded, knowing tha: 
I said was said in a fatherly and protecting spirit. I

right and Miss Coleshaw on my left; and I directed the unmarried 
lady to serve out the breakfast, and the married lady to serve out 
the tea. Likewise I said to my black steward in their presence, 
“Tom Snow, these two ladies are equally the mistresses of this 
s house, and do you obey their orders equally”; at which Tom 
laughed, and they all laughed. 
Old Mr. Rarx was not a pleasant man to look at, nor yet to 
talk to, or to be with, for no one could help seeing that he was a 
sordid and selfish character, and that he had warped further and 
tv further out of the straight with time. Not but what he was on his 
best behavior with us, as everybody was; for we had no bickering 
‘ among us, for’ard or aft. I only mean to say, he was not the man 
: one would have chosen for a messmate. If choice there had been, 
Le might even have gone a few points out of one’s course to say, 
  “No! Not him!” But, there was one eurious inconsistency in 
' Mr. Rarx. That was, that he took an astonishing interest in the 
child. He looked, and I may add, he was, one of the last men to 
care at all for a child, or care much for any human creature. 
Still, he went so far as to be habitually uneasy, if the child was 
| long on deck, out of his sight. He was always afraid of her falling   
overboard, or falling down a hatchway, or of a block or what not 
coming down upen her from the rigging in the working of the ship, 
or of her getting some hurt or other. He used to look at her and 
touch her, as if she was something precious to him. He was 
always solicitous about her not injuring her health, and constantly 
entreated her mother to be careful of it. This was so much the 
more curious, because the child did not like him, but used to shrink 
away from him, and would not even put out her hand to him with- 
out coaxing from others. I believe that every soul on board fre- 
f quently noticed this, and not one of us understood it. However, 
it was such a plain fact, that John Steadiman said more than 
once when old Mr. Rarx was not within earshot, that if the 
Golden Mary felt a tenderness for the dear old gentleman she 
carried in her lap, she must be bitterly jealous of the Golden 
Lucy. ‘ 
.Before I go any further with this narrative, I will state that 
| our ship was a bark of three hundred tons, carrying a crew of
-P-A-G-E-235
218 Junior High School Literature, Book 
eighteen men, a second mate in addition to John, a ¢---7~*7- 
armorer or smith, and two apprentices (one a Scot« 
little fellow). We had three boats; the Long-boat 
carrying twenty-five men; the Cutter, capable of carr 
and the Surf-boat, capable of carrying ten. I put dow 
ity of these boats according to the numbers they were __..., ___-. 
to hold. , 
We had tastes of bad weather and head-winds, of course 
on the whole, we had as fine a run as any reasonable man wou 
ae expect, for sixty days. I then began to enter two remarks in t 
ship’s Log and in my Journal; first, that there was an unusual a1 
amazing quantity of ice; second, that the nights were most wo 
derfully dark in spite of the ice. 
For five days and a half, it seemed quite useless ani 
15 to alter the ship’s course so as to stand out of the way 
I made what southing I could; but, all that time, we 1 
by it. Mrs. Atherfield, after standing by me on deck once, »vun1 
for some time in an.awed manner at the great bergs that sv 
rounded us, said in a whisper, “Oh! Captain Ravender, it lor-- 
if the whole solid earth had changed into ice, and broker, 
I said to her, laughing, “I don’t wonder that it does, tc 
inexperienced eyes, my dear.” But I had never seen a twe..... 
part of the quantity, and, in reality, I was pretty much of h 
opinion. - 
25 However, at two Pp. M. on the afternoon of the sixth d. 
is to say, when we were sixty-six days out, John Steadim. 
had gone aloft, sang out from the top, that the sea w: 
ahead. Before four Pp. M. a strong breeze springing up right 
we were in open water at sunset. The breeze then freshen | 
half a gale of wind, and the Golden Mary being a very fasv sau 
we went before the wind merrily, all night. 
I had thought it impossible that it could be dark: 
been, until the sun, moon, and stars should fall out of 
and Time should be destroyed; but, it had been ne 
85 comparison with what it was now. The darkness wa. 
that looking into it was painful and oppressive— 
without a ray of light, into a dense black bandag: ao 8

efore the eyes as it could be, without touching them. . I doubled 
ae lookout, and John and I stood in the bow side-by-side, never 
saving it all night. Yet I should no more have known that he was 
ear me when he was silent, without putting out my arm and 
wehing him, than I should if he had turned in and been fast 
sleep below. We were not so much looking out, all of us, as - 
stening to the utmost, both with our eyes and ears. 
Next day, I found that the mercury in the barometer, which 
ad risen steadily since we cleared the ice, remained steady. 
had had very good observations, with now and then the inter. 
.iption of a day or so, since our departure. I got the sun at noon, 
1 nd found that we were in Lat. 58° 8., Long. 60° W., off New 
suth Shetland; in the neighborhood of Cape Horn, We were 
xty-seven days out, that day. The ship’s reckoning was accu- 
itely worked and made up. The ship did her duty admirably, 
lon board were well, and all hands were as smart, efficient, and 
mtented as it was possible to be. 
When the night came on again as dark as before, it was the 
ghth night I had been on deck. Nor had I taken more than a 
ary little sleep in the daytime, my station being always near the 
, «lm, and often at it, while we were among the ice. Few but those 
tI | who have tried it can imagine the difficulty and pain of only keep- 
et | ing the eyes open—physically open—under such circumstances, in 
such darkness. They get struck by the darkness, and blinded by 
at § the darkness. They make patterns in it, and they flash in it, as 
00 | if they had gone out of your head to look’ at you. On the turn of 
| midnight, John Steadiman, who was alert and fresh (for I had 
1) always made him turn in by day), said to me, “Captain Ravender, 
tt! Lentreat of you to go below. I am sure you can hardly stand, and 
th vone voice is getting weak, sir. Go below, and take a little rest. 
Il you if a block chafes.” I said to John in answer, “Well, 
John! Let us wait till the turn of one o’clock, before we 
bout that.” I had just had one of the ship’s lanterns held 
at I might see how the night went by my watch, and it was 
wenty minutes after twelve. : 
five minutes before one, John sang out to the boy to bring 
otern again, and when I told him once more what the time
-P-A-G-E-237
220 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
was, entreated and prayed of me to go below. “Captain Raven- 
" der,” says'he, “all’s well; we can’t afford to have you laid up for 
a single hour; and I respectfully and earnestly beg of you to go 
below.” The end of it was, that I agreed to do so, on the under- 
standing that if I failed to come up of my own accord within three 
hours, I was to be punctually called. Having settled that, I left 
John in charge. But I called him to me once afterwards, to ask 
him a question. I had been to look at the barometer, and had 
seen the mercury still perfectly steady, and had come up the com- 
10 panion again to take a last look about me—if I can use such a 
word in reference to such darkness—when I thought that the 
waves, as the Golden Mary parted them and shook them off, had a 
hollow sound in them; something that I fancied was a rather un- 
- usual reverberation. I was standing by the quarterdeck rail on 
18 the starboard side, when I called John aft to me, and bade him 
listen. He did so with the greatest attention. Turning to me 
he then said, “Rely upon it, Captain Ravender, you have been 
without rest too long, and the novelty is only in the state of your 
sense of hearing.” I thought so too by that time, and I think so 
20 now, though I can never know for absolute certain in this world, 
whether it was or not. 
When I left John Steadiman in charge, the ship was still going 
at a great rate through the water. The wind still blew right 
astern. Though she was making great way, she was under short- 
26 ened sail, and had no more than she could easily carry. All was 
snug, and nothing complained. There was a pretty sea running, 
but not a high sea neither, nor at all a confused one. - 
I turned in, as we seamen say, all standing. The meaning of 
that is, I did not pull my clothes off—no, not even so much as 
so my coat; though I did my shoes, for my feet were badly swelled 
with the deck. There was a little swing-lamp alight in my cabin. 
I thought, as I looked at it before shutting my eyes, that I was 
so tired of darkness and troubled by. darkness, that I could have 
gone to sleep best in the midst of a million of flaming gas-lights. 
3s That was the last thought I had before I went off, except 
the prevailing thought that I should not be able to get to sleep 
at all.

THE WRECK 
I dreamed that I was back at Penrith again, and was trying to 
get round the church, which had altered its shape very much since 
Tlast saw it, and was cloven all down the middle of the steeple in 
a most singular manner. Why I wanted to get round the church 
5 I don’t know; but I was as anxious to do it as if my life depended 
on it. Indeed, I believe it did in the dream. For all that, I could 
not get round the church. I was still trying, when I came against 
it with a violent shock, and was flung out of my cot against the 
ship’s side. Shrieks and a terrific outcry struck me far harder 
ao than the bruising timbers, and amidst sounds of grinding and 
crashing, and a heavy rushing and breaking of water—sounds I 
| understood too well—I made my way on deck. It was not an easy 
thing to do, for the ship heeled over frightfully, and was beating 
‘na furious manner. 
T could not see the men as I went forward, but I could hear 
hat they were hauling in sail, in disorder. I had my trumpet in 
ay hand, and, after directing and encouraging them in this till it 
! was done, I hailed first John Steadiman, and then my second mate, 
“Mr. William Rames. Both answered clearly and steadily. Now, 
had practiced them and all my crew, as I have ever made it a 
-ustom to practice all who sail with me, to take certain stations 
and wait my orders, in case of any unexpected crisis. When my 
voice was heard hailing, and their voices were heard answering, 
I was aware, through all the noises of the ship and sea, and all the t 
crying of the passengers below, that there was a pause. “Are you 
ready, Rames?”—“Ay, ay, sirl!’—Then light up, for God’s 
sakel” In a moment he and another were burning blue-lights, and 
the ship and all on board seemed to be enclosed in a mist of light, 
} under a great black dome. 
The light shone up so high that I could see the huge Iceberg 
upon which we had struck, cloven at the top and down the middle, 
exactly like Penrith Church in my dream. At the same moment 
I could see the watch last relieved crowding up and down on deck; 
I could see Mrs. Atherfield and Miss Coleshaw thrown about on 
; the top of the companion as they struggled to bring the child up

from below; I could see that the masts were going with th: 
and the beating of the ship; I could see the frightful breac.. sw 
in on the starboard side, half the length of the vessel, and tl 
sheathing and timbers spirting up; I could see that the Cutter w: 
5 disabled, in a wreck of broken fragments; and I could see ever 
eye turned upon me. It is my belief that if there had * ‘ 
thousand eyes there, I should have seen them all, with th 
ent looks. And all this in a moment. But you mus' 
what a moment. 
io I saw the men, as they looked at me, fall toward ' 
pointed stations, like good men and true. If she had n 
they could have done very little there or anywhere bu’ | 
that it is little for a man to die at his post—I mean 1 
have done nothing to save the passengers and themselv | 
is pily, however, the violence of the shock with which Wo wou. 
determinedly borne down direct on that fatal Iceberg, as if 
had been our destination instead of our destruction, had — 
smashed and pounded the ship that she got off in this sar 
instant and righted. I did not want the carpenter to tell m-~ - 
20 was filling and going down; I could see and hear that. J. 
Rames the word to lower the Long-boat and the Surf-boal, —. 
I myself told off the men for each duty. Not oneht * ~ 
came before the other. I now whispered to John | 
“John, I stand at the gangway here, to see every st 
26 safe over the side. You shall have the next post oi uuuur, a 
shall be the last but one to leave the ship. Bring:up the pz 
sengers, and range them behind me; and put what provisi: | 
water you can get at in the boats. Cast your eye for’ard 
and you'll see you have not a moment to lose.” 
30 My noble fellows got the boats over the side as orderl; 
ever saw boats lowered with any sea running, and when. 
were launched, two or three of the nearest men in them as 
held on, rising and falling with the swell, called out, looking | 
at me, “Captain Ravender, if anything goes wrong with us, a 
85 you are saved, remember, we stood by you!”—‘“We'll a

The women were an example to us. They trembled very 
uch, but they were quiet and. perfectly collected. “Kiss me, 
~ 1 vaptain Ravender,” says Mrs. Atherfield, “and God in heaven 
8 | bless you, you good man!” “My dear,” says I, “those words are 
Y | better for me than a life-boat.” I held her child in my arms till 
1} she was in the boat, and then kissed the child and handed her 
| safe down. I now said to the people in her, ““You-have got your, 
| freight, my lads, all but me, and I am not eoming yet awhile. 
Pull away from the ship, and keep off!” 
*§ That was the Long-boat. Old Mr. Rarx was one of her com- 
d, ' plement, and he was the only passenger who had greatly mis- 
ot behaved since the ship struck. Others had been a little wild, 
ld which was not to be wondered at, and not very. blamable; but, he 
| had made a lamentation and uproar which it was dangerous for 
sthe people to hear, as there is always contagion in weakness and 
it selfishness. His incessant cry had been that he must not be sep- 
0 | arated from the child, that he couldn’t see the child, and that he 
¢ | and the child must go together. He had even tried to wrest the 
¢ child out of my arms, that he might keep her in his. “Mr. Rarx,” 
re bsaid I to him when it came to that, “I have a loaded pistol in my 
é pocket; and if you don’t stand out of the gangway, and keep per- 
at , fectly quiet, I shall shoot you through the heart, if you have got 
1, {one.” Says he, “You won’t do murder, Captain Ravender!” “No, 
df sir,” says I, “I won’t murder forty-four people to humor you, but 
Il shoot you to save them.” After that he was quiet, and stood 
livering a little way off, until I named him to go over the side. 
The Long-boat being cast off, the Surf-boat was soon filled, 
here only remained aboard the Golden Mary, John Mullion, 
‘e man who had kept on burning the blue-lights (and who had 
ghted every new one at every old one before it: went out, as 
aietly as if he had been at an illumination); John Steadiman; 
ad myself. I hurried those two into the Surf-boat, called to 
‘em to keep off, and waited with a grateful and relieved heart 
r the Long-boat to come and take me in, if she could. I looked 
5 my watch, and it showed me, by the blue-light, ten minutes 
ast two. They lost no time. As soon as she was near enough, 
swung myself into her, and called to the men, “With a will,

ADRIFT IN LIFE BOATS 
I suppose if we had all stood atop of a mountain, and see: 
whole remainder of the-world sink away from under us, we Coun 
10 hardly have felt more shocked and solitary than we di * 
knew we were alone on the wide ocean, and that th 
ship in which most of us had been securely asleep wit! 
hour was gone for ever. There was an awful silence i 
and such a kind of palsy on the rowers and the man at | 
1s that I felt they were scarcely keeping her before the se: 
out then, and said, “Let every one here thank the Li 
preservation!” All the voices answered (even the chi 
thank the Lord!” I then said the Lord’s Prayer, an 
said it after me with a solemn murmuring. Then I gay 
20 “Cheerily, O men, cheerily!” and I felt that they wer 
the boat again as a boat ought to be handled. 
The Surf-boat now burned another blue-light to show 1: 
they were, and we made for her, and laid ourselves ai | 
alongside of her as we dared. I had always kept my bo: 
25 a coil or two of good stout stuff in each of them, so bow yuu 
had a rope at hand. We made a shift, with mucl 
trouble, to get near enough to one another to divide th: 
(they were no use after that night, for the sea-wal 
at them), and to get a tow-rope out between us. Al 
30 we kept together, sometimes obliged to cast off tk 
sometimes getting it out again, and all of us wear: 
morning—which appeared so long in coming that o! 
screamed out, in spite of his fears of me, “The worl: 
te an end, and the sun will never rise any more!” 
3& When the day broke, I found that we were all hud |

in a miserable manner. We were deep in the water; being, as 1 
found on ‘mustering, thirty-one in number, or at least six too 
many. In the Surf-bor. they were fourteen in number, being at 
least four too many. The first thing I did, was to get myself 
s passed to the rudder—which I took from that time—and to get 
Mrs. Atherfield, her child, and Miss Coleshaw, passed on to sit 
next me. As to old Mr. Rarx, I put him in the bow, as far from 
us as I could. And I put some of the best men near us in order 
that if I should drop there might be a skillful hand ready to take 
1 the helm. 
The sea moderating as the sun came up, though the sky was 
| ¢loudy and wild, we spoke the other boat, to know what stores 
they had, and to overhaul what we had. I had a compass in my 
| pocket, a small telescope, a double-barreled pistol, a knife, and 
1 a fire-box and matches. Most of my men had knives, and some 
had a little tobacco; some, a pipe as well. We had a mug among 
us, and an iron spoon. As to provisions, there were in my boat two 
bags of biscuit, one piece of raw beef, one piece of raw pork, a bag 
of coffee, roasted but not ground (thrown in, I imagine, by mis- 
2 take, for something else), two small casks of water, and about half 
| a8 gallon of rum in a keg. The Surf-boat, having rather more rum 
than we, and fewer to drink it, gave us, as I estimated, another 
quart into our keg. In return, we gave them three double hand- 
fuls of coffee, tied up in a piece of a handkerchief; they reported 
% that they had aboard besides, a bag of biscuit, a piece of beef, 
a small cask of water, a small box of lemons, and a Dutch cheese. 
It took a long time to mate these exchanges, and they were not 
made without risk to both parties; the sea running quite high 
enough to make our approaching near to one another very hazard- 
| | 30 ous. In the bundle with the coffee, I conveyed to John Steadiman 
(who had a ship’s compass with him), a paper written in pencil, 
and torn from my pocket-book, containing the course I meant to 
steer, in the hope of making land, or being picked up by some 
vessel—I say in the hope, though I had little hope of either deliv- 
% erance. I then sang out to him, so as all might hear, that if we 
,; two boats could live or die together, we would; but, that if we 
| should be parted by the weather, and join company no more, they JH.L. 1-9
-P-A-G-E-243
  226 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
should have our prayers and blessings, and we askéd for theirs. 
We then gave them three cheers, which they returned, and I saw 
the men’s heads droop in both boats as they fell to their oars 
again. 
s These arrangements had occupied the general attention advan- 
tageously for all, though (as I expressed in the last sentence) 
they ended in a sorrowful feeling. I now said a few words to my 
fellow-voyagers on the subject of the small stock of food on which 
our lives depended if they were preserved from the great deep, 
so and on the rigid necessity of our eking it out in the most frugal 
manner. One and all replied that whatever allowance I thought 
best to lay down should be strictly kept to. We made a pair of 
scales out of a thin scrap of iron-plating and some twine, and I 
got together for weights such of the heaviest buttons among us as 
15 1 calculated made up some fraction over two ounces. This was 
the allowance of solid food served out once a day to each, from 
that time to the end; with the addition of a coffee-berry, or some- 
times half a one, when the weather was very fair, for breakfast. 
We had nothing else whatever, but half a pint of water each per 
20 day, and sometimes, when we were coldest and weakest, a tea- 
spoonful of rum each, served out as a dram. I know how learnedly 
it can be shown that rum is poison, but I also know that in this 
case, as in all similar cases I have ever read of—which are numer- 
ous—no words can express the comfort and support derived from 
25 it. Nor have I the least doubt that it saved the lives of far more 
than half our number. Having mentioned half a pint of water 
as our daily allowance, I ought to observe that sometimes we had 
less, and sometimes we had more; for much rain fell, and we 
caught it in a canvas stretched for the purpose. 
30 Thus, at that tempestuous time of the year, and in that tem- 
pestuous part of the world, we shipwrecked people rose and fell 
with the waves. It is not my intention to relate (if I can avoid 
it) such circumstances appertaining to our doleful condition as 
have been better told in many other narratives of the kind than I 
35 can be expected to tell them. I will only note, in so many passing 
words, that day after day and night after night, we received the 
sea, upon our backs to prevent it from swamping the boat; that
-P-A-G-E-244

one party was always kept bailing, and that every hat and cap 
among us soon got worn out, though patched up fifty times, as the 
only vessels we had for that service; that another party lay down 
in the bottom of the boat, while a third rowed; and that we were 
s soon ail in boils and blisters and rags. 
The other boat was a source of such anxious interest to all of 
us that I used to wonder whether, if we were saved, the time could 
ever come when the survivors in this boat of ours could be at all 
indifferent to the fortunes of the survivors in that. We got out a 
10 tow-rope whenever the weather permitted, but that did not often 
happen, and how we two parties kept within the same horizon, as 
we did, He, who mercifully permitted it to be so for our consola- 
tion, only knows. I never shall forget the looks with which, when 
the morning light came, we used to gaze about us over the stormy 
1s waters, for the other boat. We once parted company for seventy- 
, two hours, and we believed them to have gone down, as they did 
us. The joy on both sides when we came within view of one 
another again, had something in a manner Divine in it; each was 
so forgetful of individual suffering, in tears of delight. and sym- 
20 pathy for the people in the other boat. 
T have been wanting to get round to the individual or personal 
part of miy subject, as I call it, and the foregoing incident puts 
me in the right way. The patience and good disposition aboard 
of us, was wonderful. I was not surprised by it in the women; 
25 for all men born of women know what great qualities they will 
show when men fail; but, I own I was a little surprised by it in 
some of the men. Among one-and-thirty people assembled at the 
best of times, there will usually, I should say, be two or three 
uncertain tempers. I knew that I had more than one rough temper 
| % with me among my own people, for I had chosen those for the 
Long-boat that I might have them under my eye. But, they soft- 
ened under their misery, and were as considerate of the ladies, and 
as compassionate of the child, as the best among us, or among men 
—they could not have been more so. I heard scarcely any com- 
35 plaining. The party lying down would moan a good deal in their 
sleep, and I would often notice 2 man—not always the same man, 
it is to be understcod, but clearly all of them at one time or other  
-P-A-G-E-245
  228 Junior High Sehool Literature, Book One 
  —sitting moaning at his oar, or in his place, as he looked mistily 
over the sea. When it happened to be long before I could catch 
his eye, he would go on moaning all the time in the dismalest man- 
ner; but when our looks met, he would brighten and leave off. 
5 I almost always got the impression that he did not know what 
sound he had been making, but that he thought he had been 
. humming a tune. 
Our sufferings from cold and wet were far greater than our 
sufferings from hunger. We managed to keep the child warm; 
10 but, I doubt if any one else among us ever was warm for five 
minutes together; and the shivering, and the chattering of teeth, 
were sad to hear. The child cried a little at first for her lost play- 
fellow, the Golden Mary; but hardly ever whimpered afterwards; 
and when the state of the weather made it possible, she used now 
1s and then to be held up in the arms of some of us, to look over the 
sea for John Steadiman’s boat. I see the golden hair and the 
innocent face now, between me and the driving clouds, like an 
angel going to fly away. 
It happened on the second day, toward night, that Mrs. Ather- 
20 field, in getting little Lucy to sleep, sang her a song. She had a 
soft, melodious voice, and when she had finished it, our people up 
and begged for another. She sang them another, and after it had 
fallen dark ended with the Evening Hymn. From that time, 
whenever anything could be heard above the sea and wind, and 
while she had any voice left, nothing would serve the people but 
that she should sing at sunset. She always did, and always ended 
with the Evening Hymn. We mostly took up the last line, and 
shed tears when it was done, but not miserably. We had a prayer 
night and morning, also, when the weather allowed of it. 
30 Twelve nights and eleven days we had been driving in the 
boat, when old Mr. Rarx began to be delirious, and to ery out to 
me to throw the gold overboard or it would sink us, and we should 
all be lost. For days past the child had been declining, and that 
was the great cause of his wildness. He had been over and 
85 over again shrieking out to me to give her all the remaining meat, 
to give her all the remaining rum, to save her at any cost, or we 
should all be ruined. At this time, she lay in her mother’s arms » an
-P-A-G-E-246
  The Wreck of the Golden Mary 299 
  at my feet. One of her little hands was almost always creeping 
about her mother’s neck or chin. I had watched the wasting of 
the little hand, and I knew it was nearly over. 
” The old man’s cries were so discordant with the mother’s love, 
5 and submission, that I called out to him in an angry voice, unless 
he held his peace on the instant, I would order him to be knocked 
on the head and thrown overboard. He was mute then, until the 
child died, very peacefully, an hour afterwards; which was known 
to all in the boat by the mother’s breaking out into lamentations 
10 for the first time since the wreck—for she had great fortitude and 
constancy, though she was a little gentle woman. Old Mr. Rarx 
then became quite ungovernable, tearing what rags he had on 
him, raging in imprecations, and calling to me that if I had 
thrown the gold overboard (always the gold with him!) I might 
“15 have saved the child. “And now,” says he, in a terrible voice, 
“we shall founder, and all go to the Devil, for our sins will sink 
us, when we have no innocent child to bear us up!” We soon dis- 
covered with amazement, that this old wretch had only cared 
for the life of the pretty little creature dear to all of us, because 
20 of the influence he superstitiously hoped she might have in pre- 
serving him! Altogether it was too much for the smith, or 
armorer, who was sitting next the old man, to bear. He took 
him by the throat and rolled him under the thwarts, where he 
lay still enough for hours afterwards. 
. 3 All that thirteenth night, Miss Coleshaw, lying across my 
knees as I kept the helm, comforted and supported the poor 
mother. Her child, covered with a pea-jacket of mine, lay in her 
lap. It troubled me all night to think that there was no Prayer- 
Book among us, and that I could remember but very few of the 
§ 9 exact words of the burial service. When I stood up at broad day, 
all knew what was going to be done, and I noticed that my poor 
fellows made the motion of uncovering their heads, though their 
heads had been stark bare to the sky and sea for many a weary 
hour. There was a long heavy swell on, but otherwise it was a 
“ fair morning, and there were broad fields of sunlight on the waves © 
in the east. I said no more than this: “I am the Resurrection 
and the Life, saith the Lord. He raised the daughter of Jairus \
-P-A-G-E-247
  230 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
the ruler, and said she was not dead but slept. He raised the 
widow’s son. He arose Himself, and was seen of many. He 
loved little children, saying, ‘Suffer them to come unto Me and 
rebuke them not, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.’ In His 
3 name, my friends, and committed to His merciful goodness!” 
With those words I laid my rough face softly on the placid little 
forehead, and buried the Golden Lucy in the grave of the Golden 
Mary. 
Having had it on my mind to relate the end of this dear little 
10 child, I have omitted something from its exact place, which I will 
supply here. It will come quite as well here as anywhere else. 
Foreseeing that if the boat lived through the stormy weather, 
the time must come, and soon come, when we should have abso- 
lutely no morsel to eat, I had one momentous point often in my 
1s thoughts. Although I had, years before that, fully satisfied 
myself that the instances in which human beings in the last dis- 
tress have fed upon each other, are exceedingly few, and have 
very seldom indeed (if ever) occurred when the people in distress, 
however dreadful their extremity, have been accustomed te mod- 
20 erate forbearance and restraint; I say, though I had long before 
quite satisfied my mind on this topic, I felt doubtful whether 
there might not have been in former cases some harm and danger 
from keeping it out of sight and pretending not to think of it. I 
felt doubtful whether some minds, growing weak with fasting and 
25 exposure and having such a terrific idea to dwell upon in secret, 
might not magnify it until it got to have an awful attraction 
about it. This was not a new thought of mine, for it had grown 
out of my reading. However, it came over me stronger than it 
had ever done before—as it had reason for doing—in the boat, 
30 and on the fourth day I decided that I would bring out into the 
light that unformed fear which must have been more or less 
darkly in every brain among us. Therefore, as a means of be- 
guiling the time and inspiring hope, I gave them the best sum- 
mary in my power of Bligh’s voyage of more than three thousand 
38 miles, in an open boat, after the Mutiny of the Bounty, and of 
the wonderful preservation of that boat’s crew. They listened 
throughout with great interest, and I concluded by telling them
-P-A-G-E-248
  
  The Wreck of the Golden Mary 231 
  | that, in my opinion, the happiest circumstance in the whole nar- 
| tative was that Bligh, who was no delicate man, either, hac 
solemnly placed it on record therein that he was sure and cértain 
that under no conceivable circumstances whatever would that. 
5 emaciated party, who had gone through all the pains of famine, 
have preyed on one another. I cannot describe the visible relief 
which this spread through the boat, and how the tears stood in 
every eye. From that time I was as well convinced as Bligh 
himself that there was no danger, and that this phantom, at any 
| 1 rate, did not haunt us. 
Now, it was a part of Bligh’s experience that when the people. 
in his boat were most cast down, nothing did them so much good. 
as hearing a story told by one of their number. When I men- 
tioned that, I saw that it struck the general attention as much 
"18 as it did my own, for I had not thought of it until I came to it. 
inmy summary. This was on the day after Mrs. Atherfield first 
sang tous. I proposed that, whenever the weather would permit, 
we should have a story two hours after dinner (I always issued. 
the allowance I have mentioned at one o’clock, and called it by 
} 20 that name), as well as our song at sunset. The proposal was 
received with a cheerful satisfaction that warmed :ny heart within 
me; and I do not say too much when I say that those two periods. 
in the four-and-twenty hours were expected with positive pleas- 
ure, and were really enjoyed by all hands. Specters as we soon 
128 were, in our bodily wasting, our imaginations did not perish like 
the gross flesh upon our bones. Music and Adventure, two of 
the great gifts of Providence to mankind, could charm us long 
after that was lost. 
The wind was almost always against us after the second day; 
{3% and for many days together we could not nearly hold our own. 
We had all varieties of bad weather. We had rain, hail, snow, 
wind, mist, thunder, and lightning. Still the boats lived through 
the heavy seas, and still we perishing people rose and fell with 
the great waves. 
% Sixteen nights and fifteen days, twenty nights and nineteen 
| days, twenty-four nights and twenty-three days. So the time 
    
went on. Disheartening as I knew that our progress, or want
-P-A-G-E-249
  232 Junior High School Literature, Book One ——$ $$   
of progress, must be, I never deceived them as to my calculations 
. of it. In the first place, I felt that we were all too near eternity 
for deceit; in the second place, I knew that if I failed, or died, 
the man who followed me must have a knowledge of the true state 
5 of things to begin upon. When I told them at noon, what I 
reckoned we had made or lost, they generally received what I 
said in a tranquil and resigned manner, and always gratefully 
toward me. It was not unusual at any time of the day for some 
one to burst out weeping loudly without any new cause; and, 
10 when the burst was over, to calm down a little better than before. 
I had seen exactly the same thing in a house of mourning. 
During the whole of this time, old Mr. Rarx had had his fits 
of calling out to me to throw the gold (always the gold!) over- 
board, and of heaping violent reproaches upon me for not having 
1s saved the child; but now, the food being all gone, and I having 
nothing left to serve out but a bit of coffee-berry now and then, 
he began to be too weak to do this, and consequently fell silent. 
Mrs. Atherfield and Miss Coleshaw generally lay, each with an 
arm across one of my knees and her head upon it. They never 
« complained at all. Up to the time of her child’s death, Mrs. 
Atherfield had bound up her own beautiful hair every day; and I 
took particular notice that this was always before she sang her 
song at night, when every one looked at her. But she never did 
it after the loss of her darling; and it would have been now all 
25 tangled with dirt and wet, but that Miss Coleshaw was careful 
of it long after she was, herself, and would sometimes smooth it 
down with her weak thin hands. 
We were past mustering a story now; but one day, at about 
this period, I reverted to the superstition of old Mr. Rarx, con- 
30 cerning the Golden Lucy, and told them that nothing vanished 
from the eyé of God, though much might pass away from the 
eyes of men. ‘We were all of us,” says I, “children once; and 
our baby feet have strolled in green woods ashore; and our baby 
hands have gathered flowers in gardens, where the birds were 
35 singing. The children that we were, are not lost to the great 
knowledge of our Creator. Those innocent creatures will appear 
with us before Him, and plead for us. What we were in the best

| time of our generous youth will arise and go with us too. The 
; purest part of our lives will not desert us at the pass to which all 
| of us here present are gliding. What we were then, will be as 
much in existence before Him, as what we are now.” They were 
5 no less comforted by this consideration, than I was myself; and 
Miss Coleshaw, drawing my ear nearer to her lips, said, “Captain 
Ravender, I was on my way to marry a disgraced and broken 
man, whom I dearly loved when he was honorable and good. 
Your words seem to have come out of my own poor heart.” She 
10 pressed my hand upon it, smiling. 
Twenty-seven nights and twenty-six days. We were in no want 
of rain-water, but-we had nothing else. And yet, even now, I 
never turned my eyes on a waking face but it tried to brighten | 
before mine. O what a thing it is, in a time of danger and in 
“15 the presence of death, the shining of a face upon a face! I have 
heard it broached that orders should be given in great new ships 
by electric telegraph. I admire machinery as much as any man, 
and am as thankful to it as any man can be for what it does. for 
us. But it will never be a substitute for the face of a man, with 
%” his soul in it, encouraging another man to be brave and true. 
Never try it for that. It will break down like a straw. 
I now began to remark certain changes in myself which I did 
not like. They caused me much disquiet. I often saw the 
Golden Lucy in the air above the boat. I-.often saw her I have 
1% spoken of before, sitting beside me. I saw the Golden Mary go 
| down, as she really had gone down, twenty times in a day. And 
yet the sea was mostly, to my thinking, not sea neither, but 
moving country and extraordinary mountainous regions, the like 
of which have never been beheld. I felt it time to leave my last 
\" words regarding John Steadiman, in case any lips should last out 
to repeat them to any living ears. -I said that John had told me 
(as he had on deck) that he had sung out “Breakers ahead!” the 
instant they were audible, and had tried to wear ship, but she 
struck before it could be done. (His cry, I dare say, had’ made

had done his duty nobly, like the man he was. I tried t

| “Rames,” says I, “it’s a signal of distress. Pass the word 
| forward to keep her before the sea, and no more. We must get 
the Long-boat within hailing distance of us, as soon as possible.” 
I dropped down into my old place at the tiller without another 
s word—for the thought went through me like a knife that some- 
thing had. happened to Captain Ravender. I should consider 
myself unworthy to write another line of this statement, if I had 
not made up my mind to speak the truth, the whole truth, and 
nothing but the truth—and I must, therefore, confess plainly that 
ko now, for the first time, my heart sank within me. This weak- 
ness on my part was produced in some degree, as I take it, by the 
’ exhausting effects of previous anxiety and grief. 
Our provisions—if I may give that name to what we had left 
—were reduced to the rind of one lemon and about a couple of 
- 45 handfuls of coffee-berries, Besides these great distresses, caused: 
by the death, the dange>, and the suffering among my crew and 
passengers, I had had a little distress of my own to shake me still 
more, in the death of the child whom I had got to be very fond 
of on the voyage out—-so fond that I was secretly a little jealous 
of her being taken in the Long-boat instead of mine when the 
i ship foundered. It used to be a great comfort to me, and I think 
_ to those with me also, after we had seen the last of the Golden 
Mary, to see the Golden Lucy, held up by the men in the Long- 
boat, when the weather allowed it, as the best and brightest sight 
r they had to show. She looked, at the distance we saw her from, 
almost like a little white bird in the air. To miss her for the 
first time, when the weather lulled a little again, and we all looked 
out for our white bird and looked in vain, was a sore disappoint- 
ment. To see the men’s heads bowed down and the captain’s 
hand pointing into the sea when we hailed the Long-boat, a few 
days after, gave me as heavy a shock and as sharp a pang of 
heartache to bear as ever I remember suffering in all my life. I 
only mention these things to show that if I did give way a little 
at first, under the dread that our captain was lost to us, it was 
not without having been a good deal shaken beforehand by more 
trials of one sort or another than often fall to one man’s share.

we had fearéd, and then communicated what instructions I had 
to give, to William Rames, who was to be left in command in my 
place when I took charge of the Long-boat. After that, there was 
nothing to be done, but to wait for the chance of the wind drop- 
5 ping at sunset, and the sea going down afterwards, so as to enable 
our weak crews to lay the two boats alongside of each other, 
without undue risk—or, to put it plainer, without saddling our- 
, selves with the necessity for any extraordinary exertion of 
strength or skill. Both the one and the other had now been 
|: starved out of us for days and days together. 
At sunset the wind suddenly dropped, but the sea, which had 
been running high for so long a time past, took hours after that 
before it showed any signs of getting to rest. The moon was 
shining, the sky was wonderfully clear, and it could not have 
| 45 been, according to my calculations, far off midnight, when the 
long, slow, regular swell of the calming ocean fairly set in, and 
| 1 took the responsibility of lessening the distance between the 
Long-boat and ourselves. 
It was, I dare say, a delusion of mine; but 1 thought I had 
20 never seen the moon shine so white and ghastly anywhere, either 
at sea or on land, as she shone that night while we were approach- 
ing our companions in misery. When there was not much more 
than a boat’s length between us, and the white light streamed 
cold and clear over all our faces, both crews rested on their oars 
,% With one great shudder, and stared over the gunwale of either 
boat, panic-stricken at the first sight of each other. 
| “Any lives lost among you?” I asked, in the midst of that 
  frightful silence. . 
The men in the Long-boat huddled together like sheep at the 
| 90 sound of my voice. 
“None yet, but the child, thanks be to God!” answered one 
among them. 
And at the sound of his voice, all my men shrank together 
like the men in the Long-boat.. I was afraid to let the horror 
3% produced by our first meeting at close quarters after the dreadful 
changes that wet, cold, and famine had produced, last one moment 
longer than could be helped; so, without giving time for any more
-P-A-G-E-255
ll

questions and answers, I commanded the men to lay the two boats 
close alongside cf each other. When I rose up and committed 
the tiller to the hands of Rames, all my poor fellows raised their 
white faces imploringly to mine. “Don’t leave us, sir,” they said, 
5 “don’t leave us.” “I leave you,” says I, “under the command 
and the guidance of Mr. William Rames, as good a sailor as I am, 
and as trusty and kind a man as ever stepped. Do your duty by 
him, as you have done it by me; and remember to the last, that 
while there is life there is hope. God bless and help you all!” 
10 With those words I collected what strength I had left, and caught 
at two arms that were held out to me, and so got from the stern- 
sheets of one boat into the stern-sheets of the other. 
“Mind where you step, sir,” whispered one of the men who had 
helped me into the Long-boat. I looked down as he spoke. Three 
1s figures were huddled up below me, with the moonshine falling on 
them in ragged streaks through the gaps between the men stand- 
ing or sitting above them. The first face I made out was the 
face of Miss Coleshaw; her eyes were wide open and fixed on me. 
She seemed still to keep her senses, and, by the alternate parting 
20 and closing of her lips, to be trying to speak, but I could not 
hear that she uttered a single word. On her shoulder rested the 
head of Mrs. Atherfield. The mother of our poor little Golden 
Lucy must, I think, have been dreaming of the child she had lost; 
for there was a faint smile just ruffling the white stillness of her 
28 face, when I first saw it turned upward, with peaceful closed eyes 
toward the heavens. From her, I looked down a little, and there, 
with his head on her lap, and with one of her hands resting ten- 
derly on his cheek—there lay the captain, to whose help and 
guidance, up to this miserable time, we had never looked in vain. 
so —there, worn out at last in our service, and for our sakes, lay the 
best and bravest man of all our company. I stole my hand in 
gently through his clothes and laid it on his heart, and felt a little 
feeble warmth over it, though my cold dulled touch could not 
detect even the faintest beating. The two men in the stern-sheets 
35 with me, noticing what I was doing—knowing I loved him like a 
brother—and seeing, I suppose, more distress in my face than I 
myself was conscious of its showing, lost command over themselves

  altogether, and, burst into a piteous moaning, sobbing lamenta- 
tion over him. One of the two drew aside a jacket from his feet, 
and showed me that they were bare, except where a wet, ragged 
strip of stocking still clung to one of them. When the ship struck 
s the Jeeberg, he had run on deck leaving his shoes in his cabin. 
All through the voyage in the boat his feet had been unprotected; 
and not a soul had discovered it until he dropped! As long as 
he could keep his eyes open, the very look of them had cheered 
| the men, and comforted and upheld the women. Not one living 
  w creature in the boat, with any sense about him, but had felt the 
good influence of that brave man in one way or another. Not one 
| but had heard him, over and over again, give the credit to others 
which was due only to himself; praising this man for patience, 
and thanking that man for help, when the patience and the help. 
13 had really and truly, as to the best part or both, come only from 
him. All this. gnd much more, I heard pouring confusedly from 
the men’s lips while they crouched down, sobbing and crying over 
their commander, and wrapping the jacket as warmly and ten- 
derly as they could over his cold feet. It went to my heart to 
*0 check them; but I knew that if this lamenting spirit spread any 
further, all chance of keeping alight any last sparks of hope and 
resolution among the boat’s company would be lost for ever. 
Accordingly I sent them to their places, spoke a few encouraging 
words to the men forward, promising to serve out, when the 
)3 morning came, as much as I dared, of any eatable thing left in 
the lockers; called to Rames, in my old boat, to keep as near us 
as he safely could; drew the garments and coverings of the two 
} poor suffering women more closely about them; and, with a secret 
prayer to be directed for the best in bearing the awful responsi- 
» bility now laid on my shoulders, took my captain’s vacant place 
at the helm of the Long-boat. : 
This, as well as I can tell it, is the full and true account of 
how I came to be placed in charge of the lost passengers and 
erew of the Golden Mary, on the morning of the twenty-seventh 
3 day after the ship struck the Iceberg, and foundered at sea, |

Cuaptrr II—Tue Rescvur 
THE END OF THE FOOD SUPPLY 
When the sun rose on the twenty-seventh day of our calamity, 
the first question that I secretly asked myself was, “How many 
more mornings will the stoutest of us live to see”? I had kept 
eount, ever since we tock to the boats, of the days of the week; 
s and I knew that we had now arrived at another Thursday. Judg- 
ing by my own sensations (and I believe I had as much strength 
left as the best man among us), I came to the conclusion that, 
unless the mercy of Providence interposed to effect our deliver- 
ance, not one of our company could hope to see another morning 
ao after the morning of Sunday. 
Two discoveries that I made—after redeeming my promise 
overnight, to serve out with the morning whatever eatable thing 
I could find—helped to confirm me in my gloomy view of our 
future prospects. In the first place, when the few coffee-berries 
left, together with a small allowance of water, had been shared 
all round, I found on examining the lockers that not one grain of 
provision remained, fore or aft, in any part of the boat, and that 
our stock of fresh water was reduced to not much more than 
would fill a wine-bottle. In the second place, after the berries 
20 had been shared, and the water equally divided, I noticed that 
the sustenance thus administered produced no effect whatever, 
even of the most momentary kind, in raising the spirits of the 
passengers (excepting in one case) or in rallying the strength of 
the crew. The exception was Mr. Rarx. This tough and greedy 
25 old sinner seemed to wake up from the trance he had lain in so 
long, when the smell of the berries and water was under his nose. 
He swallowed his share with a gulp that many a younger and 
better man in the boat might have envied; and went maundering 
on to himself afterwards, as if he had got a new lease of life. He 
30 fancied now that he was digging a gold-mine, all by himself, and 
going down bodily straight through the earth at the rate of thirty » a

  or forty miles an hour. “Leave me alone,” says he, “leave me 
alone. The lower I go, the richer 1 get. Down 1 go!—down, 
down, down, down, till I burst out at the other end of the world : 
in a shower of gold!” So he went on, kicking feebly with his 
s heels from time to time against the bottom of the boat. 
But, as for all the rest, it was a pitiful and dreadful sight to 
see of how little use their last shadow of a meal was to them. I 
myself attended, before anybody else was served, to the two poor 
women. Miss Coleshaw shook her head faintly, and pointed to 
w her throat, when I offered her the few berries that fell to her 
share. I made a shift to crush them up fine and mix them with 
| a little water, and got her to swallow that miserable drop of drink 
with the greatest difficulty. When it was down there came no 
change for the better over her face. Nor did she recover, for so 
! 4s much as a moment, the capacity to speak, even in a whisper. I 
next tried Mrs. Atherfield. It was hard to wake her out of the ~ 
half-swooning, half-sleeping condition in which she lay—and 
harder. still to get her to open her lips when I put the tin-cup to 
them. When I had at last prevailed on her to swallow her allow- 
20 ance, she shut her eyes again, and fell back into her old position. 
I saw her lips moving; and, putting my ear close to them, caught 
some of the words she was murmuring to herself. She was still 
dreaming of the Golden Lucy. She and the child were walking 
somewhere by the banks of a lake, at the time the buttercups are 
2x out. The Golden Lucy was gathering the buttercups, and making 
herself a watch-chain out of them, in imitation of the chain that 
her mother wore. They were carrying a little basket with them, 
and were going to dine together in a great hollow tree growing 
on the banks of the lake. To get this pretty picture painted on 
| # one’s mind as I got it, while listening to the poor mother’s broken 
words, and then to look up at the haggard faces of the men in the 
boat, and at the wild ocean rolling all round us, was such a change 
from fancy to reality as it has fallen, I hope, to few men’s lots to 
experience. _ oo 
3% My next thought, when I had done my best for the women, 
was for the captain. I was free to risk losing my own share of 
water, if I pleased, so I tried, before tasting it myself, to get a —, 
 
-P-A-G-E-259

  little between his lips; but his teeth were fast clenched, and I had 
neither strength nor skill to open them. The faint warmth still 
remained, thank God, over his heart—but, in all other respects he 
lay beneath us like a dead man. In covering him up again as 
5 comfortably. as I could, I found a bit of paper crunched in one of 
his hands, and took it out. There was some writing on it, but not 
a word was readable. I suppose, poor fellow, that he had been 
trying to write some last instructions for me, just before he 
dropped at his post. If they had been ever so easy to read, they 
io would have been of no use now. To follow instructions we must 
have had some power to shape the boat’s course in a given direc- 
tion—and this, which we had been gradually losing for some days 
past, we had now lost altogether. 
I had hoped that the serving out of the refreshment would 
16 have put a little modicum of strength into the arms of the men 
at the oars; but, as I have hinted, this hope turned out to be per- 
fectly fruitless. Our last mockery of a meal, which had done 
nothing for the passengers, did nothing either for the crew— 
except to aggravate the pangs of hunger in the men who were still 
20 strong enough to feel them. While the weather held moderate, it 
was not of much consequence if one or two of the rowers kept 
dropping, in turn, into a kind of faint sleep over their oars. But 
if it came on to blow again (and we could expect nothing else in 
those seas and at that time of the year), how was I to steer, when 
25 the blades of the oars were out of the water ten times as often 
as they were in? The lives which we had undergone such suffer- 
ing to preserve would have been lost in an instant by the 
swamping of the boat, if the wind had risen on the morning of 
Thursday, and had caught us trying to row any longer. 
30 Feeling this, I resolved, while the weather held moderately 
fine, to hoist the best substitute for a sail that we could produce, 
and to drive before the wind, on the chance (the last we had hope 
for) of a ship picking us up. We had only continued to use the 
oars up to this time in order to keep the course which the captain 
36 had pointed out as likeliest to bring us near the land. Sailing 
had been out of the question from the first, the masts and suits 
of sails belonging to each boat having been out of them at the
-P-A-G-E-260
  The Wreck of the Golden Mary — : 243 
  time of the wreck, and having gone down with the ship. This 
yas an accident which there was no need to deplore, for we were 
_ too crowded from the first to admit of handling the boats prop- 
erly, under their regular press of sail, in anything like rough 
5 weather. 
Having made up my mind on what it was necessary to do I 
addressed the men, and told them that any notion of holding 
longer on our course with the oars was manifestly out of the 
question, and dangerous to all on board, as their own common 
|: sense might tell them, in the state to which the stoutest arms 
among us were now reduced. They looked round on each other 
| as I said that, each man seeming to think his neighbor weaker 
than himself. I went on, and told them that we must take ad- 
vantage of our present glimpse of moderate weather, and hoist 
1 the best sail we could set up, and drive before the wind, in the 
| hope that it might please God to direct us in the way of some 
ship before it was too late. “Our only chance, my men,” I said, 
in conclusion, “is the chance of being picked up; and in these 
desolate seas one point of the compass is just as likely a point for 
our necessities as another. Half of you keep the boat before the 
sea, the other half bring out your knives, and do as I tell you.” 
The prospect of being relieved from the oars struck the wander- 
ing attention of the men directly; and they said, “Ay, ay, sir!” 
with something like a faint reflection of their former readiness, 
23 when the good ship was under their feet, and the mess-cans were 
filled with plenty of wholesome food. . 
Thanks to Captain Ravender’s forethought in providing both 
boats with a coil of rope, we had our lashings, and the means of 
making what rigging was wanted, ready to hand. One of the 
39 oars was made fast to the thwart, and well stayed fore and aft, 
fora mast. A large pilot-coat that I wore was spread; enough of 
sail for us. The only difficulty that puzzled me was occasioned 
by the necessity of making a yard. The men tried to tear up one 
of the thwarts, but were not strong enough. My own knife had 
% been broken in the attempt to split a bit of plank for them; and 
I was almost at my'wit’s end, when I luckily thought of searching 
the captain’s pockets for his knife. I found it—a fine large
-P-A-G-E-261
  244 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
knife of Sheffield manufacture, with plenty of blades, and a small 
saw among them. With this we made a shift to saw off about 
a third of another oar; and then the difficulty was conquered; and 
we got my pilot-coat hoisted on our jury-mast, and rigged it as 
nigh as we could to the fashion of a lug-sail. 
I had looked anxiously toward the Surf-boat, while we were 
rigging our mast, and observed, with a fecling of great relief, 
that the men in her—as soon as they discovered what we were 
about—were wise enough to follow our example. They got on 
faster than we did; being less put to it for room to turn round in. 
We set our sails as nearly as possible about the same time; and 
it was well for both boats that we finished our work when we did. 
At noon the wind began to rise again to a stiff breeze, which soon 
knocked up a heavy, tumbling sea. We drove before it in a 
direction North by East, keeping wonderfully dry, considering 
all things. The mast stood well; and the sail, small as it was, 
did good service in steadying the boat and lifting her easily over 
the seas. I felt the cold after the loss of my coat, but not so 
badly as I had feared; for the two men who were with me in the 
stern-sheets, sat as close as they could on either side of me, and 
helped with the warmth of their own bodies to keep the warmth 
in mine. Forward, I told off half a dozen of the most trust- 
worthy of the men who could still muster strength enough to 
keep their eyes open, to set a watch, turn and turn about, on our 
frail rigging. The wind was steadily increasing; and if any acci- 
. dent happened to our mast the chances were that the boat would 
broach-to, and that every one of us would go to the bottom. 
So we drove on—all through that day—-sometimes catching 
sight of the Surf-boat a little ahead of us—sometimes losing her 
so altogether in the scud. How little and frail, how very different 
to the kind of boat that I had expected to see, she looked to my 
eyes now that I was out of her, and saw what she showed like 
on the waters for the first time! But to return to the Long-boat. 
The watch on the rigging was relieved every two hours, and at 
35 the same regular periods all the brightest eyes left amongst us 
looked out for the smallest vestige of a sail in view, and looked 
in vain. Among the passengers, nothing happened in the way an e ° m HX » 3 ro} a
-P-A-G-E-262

of a change—except that Miss Coleshaw seemed to grow fainter, 
and that Mrs. Atherfield got restless, as if she were waking out 
of her long dream about the Golden Lucy. 
It got.on toward sunset. The wind was rising to half a gale. 
5 The clouds, which had been heavy all over the firmament since 
noon, were lifting to the westward, and leaving there, over the 
horizon line of the ocean, a long strip of clear, pale, greenish sky, 
| overhung by a cloud-bank, whose ragged edges were tipped with 
burning crimson by the sun. I did not like the look of the night, 
wand, keeping where I was, in the forward part of the boat, I 
helped the men to ease the strain off our mast, by lowering the 
| yard a little and taking a pull on the sheet, so as to present to 
the wind a smaller surface even of our small sail. Noting the 
wild look of the weather, and the precautions we were taking 
13 against the chance of a gale rising in the night—and being, fur- 
thermore, as I believe, staggered in their minds by the death 
that had taken place among them—three of the passengers strug- 
gled up in the bottom of the boat, clasped their arms around me 
as if they were drowning men already, and hoarsely clamored for 
20 a last drink of water, before the storm rose and sent us all to the 
bottom. 
“Water you shall have,” I said, “when I think the time has 
come to serve it out. The time has not come yet.” 
“Water, pray!” they all three groaned together. Two more 
% passengers who were asleep, woke up, and joined the cry. 
“Silence!” I said. “There are not two spoonfuls of fresh 
water left for each man in the boat. I shall wait three hours moré 
for the chance of rain before I serve that out. Silence, and drop 
back to your places!” 
  A SAIL IN SIGHT 
2 They let go of me, but clamored weakly for water still; and, 
this time, the voices of some of the crew joined them. At this 
moment, to my great alarm (for I thought they were going mad 
and turning violent against me), I was seized round the neck by 
one of the men, who had been standing up, holding on by the 
% mast, and looking out steadily to the westward. 
7
-P-A-G-E-263

246 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
I raised my right hand to free myself; but before I touched 
him, the sight of the man’s face close to mine made me drop my 
arm again, There was a speechless, breathless, frantic joy in it, 
that made all the blood in my veins stand still in a moment. 
5 “Out with it!” I said. “Man alive, out with it, for God’s 
sake!” 
His breath beat on my cheek in hot, quick, heavy gasps; but 
he could not utter a word. For a moment he let go of the mast 
(tightening his hold on me with the other arm) and pointed 
10 out’ westward—then slid heavily down on to the thwart be- 
hind us. 
I looked westward, and saw that one of the two trustworthy 
‘men whom I had left at the helm was on his feet looking out west- 
ward, too. As the boat rose, I fixed my eyes on the strip of clear 
45 greenish sky in the west, and on the bright line of the sea just 
under it. The boat dipped again before I could see anything. I 
squeezed my eyelids together to get the water out of them, and 
when we rose again looked straight into the middle of the bright 
sea-line. My heart bounded as if it would choke me—my tongue 
20 felt like a cinder in my mouth—-my knees gave way under me— 
T dropped down on to the thwart, and sobbed out, with a great 
effort, as if I had been dumb for weeks before, and had only that 
instant found my speech: 
“A sail! a sail!” 
25 The words were instantly echoed by the man in the stern- 
sheets. 
“Sail, ho!” he screeches out, turning round on us, ana swinging 
his arms about his head like a madman. 
This made three of our company who had seen the ship 
30 already, and that one fact was sufficient to remove all dread lest 
our eyes might have been deceiving us. The great fear now was, 
not that we were deluded, but that we might come to some serious 
harm through the excess of joy among the people; that is to say, 
among such of the people as still had the sense to feel and the 
36 strength to express what they felt. I must record in my own 
justification, after confessing that I lost command over myself 
altogether on the discovery of the sail, that I was the first who
-P-A-G-E-264
    The W-eck of the Golden Mary : 247 
set the example of self-control. I was in a manner forced to this 
by the crew frantically entreating me to lay-to until we could 
make out what course the ship was steering—a proceeding which, 
with the sea then running, with the heavy lading of the boat, 
3 and with such feeble substitutes for mast anc. sail as we possessed, 
must have been attended with total destruction to us all. I tried 
to remind the men of this, but they were in such a transport— 
hugging each other round the neck, and crying and laughing all 
| ina breath—that they were not fit to listen to reason. Accord- 
iw ingly, I myself went to the helm again, and chose the steadiest 
of my two men in the after-part of the boat, as a guard over the 
sheet, with instructions to use force, if necessary, toward any one 
who stretched out so much as a finger to it. The wind was rising 
every minute, and we had nothing for it but to scud, and be 
5 thankful to God’s mercy that we had sea-room to do it in. 
| “Tt will be dark in an hour’s.time, sir,” says the man left along 
with me when I took the helm again. ‘“We have no light to show. 
| The ship will pass us in the night. Lay-to, sir! For the love of 
Heaven, give us all a chance, and lay-to!” says he, and goes dewn 
% on his knees before me, wringing his hands, 
“Lay-tol” says I. “Lay-to, under a coat! Lay-to, in a boat 
like this, with the wind getting up a gale! A seaman like you 
talk in that way! Who have I got along here with me? Sailers 
who know their craft, or a pack of ’longshore lubbers, who ought 
to be turned adrift in a ferry-boat. on a pond?” My heart was 
heavy enough, God knows, but I spoke out as loud as I could, in 
that light way, to try and shame the men back to their proper 
senses. I succeeded at least in restoring silence; and that was 
something in such a condition as ours. 
My next anxiety was to know if the men in the Surf-boat had 
sighted the sail to the westward. She was still driving ahead of 
us, and the first time I saw her rise on the waves, I made out a 
signal on board—a strip of cloth fastened to a boat-hook. I 
ordered the man by my side to return it with his jacket tied on 
8 to the end of the oar; being anxious to see whether his agitation 
had calmed down and left him fit for his duty again. He fol- 
lowed my direction steadily and when he got his jacket on again,

I shook hands with him, and gave him the helm, in pr:

It would not express much to any but seafaring readers if I

between us, when I say that no landsman’s eye could hav:

The Wreck of the Golden Mary 249 
The men felt this bitterly, as the cloud-bank dropped to the 
verge of the waters, and the sun set redly behind it. The moan- 
ing and lamenting among them was miserable to hear, when the 
last speck and phantom of. the ship had vanished from view. 
1s Some few still swore they. saw her when there was hardly a flicker 
ot light left in the west, and only gave up looking out, and 
dropped down in the boat, at my express orders. I charged them 
all solemnly to set an example of courage to the passengers, and 
to trust the rest to the infinite wisdom and mercy of the Creator 
be us all. Some murmured, some fell to repeating scraps out of 
the Bible and Prayer-Book, some wandered again in their minds. 
| This went on till the darkness gathered—then a great hush of 
silence fell drearily over passengers and crew; and the waves and 
the wind hissed and howled about us, as if we were tossing in the 
8 midst of them, a boat-load of corpses already! 
Twice in the fore-part of the night the clouds overhead parted 
for a little, and let the blessed moonlight down upon us. ‘On the 
first of those occasions, I myself served out the last drops of fresh 
water we had left. The two women—poor suffering creatures!— 
were past drinking. Miss Coleshaw shivered a little when I 
moistened her lips with the water; and Mrs. Atherfield, when I 
did the same for-her, drew her breath with a faint, fluttering sigh, 
which was just. enough to show that she was not dead yet. The 
captain still lay as he had lain ever since I got on board the boat. 
The others, both passengers and crew, managed for the most part 
to swallow their share of the water—the men being just suffi- 
ciently roused by it to get up on their knees, while the moonlight 
lasted, and look about wildly over the ocean for a chance of seeing 
the ship again. When the clouds gathered once more, they 
' crouched back in their places with a long groan of despair. Hear- 
ing that, and dreading the effect of the pitchy darkness (to say 
nothing of the fierce wind and sea) on their sinking spirits, I 
tesolved to combat their despondency, if it were still possible to 
contend against it, by giving them something to do. First telling 
them that no man could say at what time of the night the ship 
(in case she was steering our course) might forge ahead of us, or 
how near she might be when she passed, I recommended that all

who had the strength should join their voices at reguiar intervals, 
and shout their loudest when the boat rose highest on the waves, 
on the chance of that cry of distress being borne by the wind 
within hearing of the watch on board the ship. It is unnecessary 
to say that I knew well how near it was to an absolute impossi- 
bility that this last feeble exertion on our parts could lead to any 
result. I only proposed it because I was driven to the end of my 
resources to keep up the faintest flicker of spirit among the men.

' the men.forward to give him a shake and make him-hold his 
| tongue. Whether any of them obeyed or not, I don’t know—Mr. 
Rarx went on raving louder than ever. The shrill wind was now 
hardly more shrill than he. He swore he saw the white frock of 
our poor little lost pet fluttering in the daylight, at the top of the 
mine, and he screamed out to her in a great fright that the gold 
was heavy, and the water rising fast, and that she must come 
down as quick as lightring if she meant to be in time to help 
them. I called again angrily to the men to silence him; and 
just as I did so, the clouds began to part for the second time, and 
the white tip of the moon grew visible. 
“There she is!” screeches Mr. Rarx; and I saw him by the 
faint light, scramble on his knees in the bottom of the boat, and 
wave a ragged old handkerchief up at the moon. 
r “Pull him down!” I called out. “Down with him; and tie his 
arms and legs!” 
Of the men who could still move about, not one paid any 
| attention to me. They were all upon their knees again, looking 
out in the strengthening moonlight for a sight of the ship. 
“Quick, Golden Lucy!” screams Mr. Rarx, and creeps under 
the thwarts right forward into the bows of the boat. “Quick! 
my darling, my beauty, quick! The gold is heavy, and the water 
rises fast! Come down and save me, Golden Lucy! Let all the 
rest of the world drown, and save me! Me! me! me! me!” 
He shouted these last words out at the top of his cracked, 
| croaking voice, and got on his feet, as I conjectured (for the coat 
we had spread for a sail now hid him from me) in the bows of the 
| boat. Not one of the crew so much as looked round at him, so 
eagerly were their eyes seeking for the ship. The man sitting 
by me was sunk in a deep sleep. If I had left the helm for a 
oment in that wind and sea, it would have been the death of 
ery soul of us. I shouted desperately to the raving wretch to 
; down. A screech that seemed to cut the very wind in two 
iswered me. A huge wave tossed the boat’s head up wildly at 
same moment. I looked aside to leeward as the wash of 
e-great roller swept by us, gleaming of a lurid, bluish white in 
e moonbeams; I looked and saw, in one second of time, the face

of it, as the relation of this one fact. I leave it tos 
the sad and shocking truth, and pass on gladly to -0 Jog & 
what happened next, at a later hour of the night. 
After the clouds had shut out the moon again, the 
1s dropped a little and shifted a point or two, so as to shape wo 
course nearer to the eastward. How the hours passed after ‘* 
till the dawn came, is more than I can tell. The nearer th: 
of daylight approached the more completely everything si 
- to drop out of my mind, except the one thought of where tk 
20 we had seen in the evening might be, when we looked for he | 
the morning light. 
Jt came at last—that gray, quiet light which was to end al 
our uncertainty; which was to show us if we were saved, or t 
warn us if we were to prepare for death. With the first ©

and the senseless, roused up and looked out in breathle | 
upon the sea. Slowly and slowly the daylight strengthuwu,

of the waters. The first pale flush of the sun flew tremblin

' the ship, poured out their whole heart in humble thanksgiving to 
| the Divine Mercy which had saved them from the very jaws of 
death. They did not wait for me to bid them do this; they did it 
of their own accord, in their own language, fervently, earnestly, 
with one will and one heart. 
SAFETY AT LAST 
We had hardly made the ship out—a fine brigantine, hoisting 
English colors—before we observed that her crew suddenly hove 
her up inthe wind. At first we were at a loss to understand this; 
but as we drew nearer, we discovered that she was getting the 
¢ Surf-boat (which had kept ahead of us all through the night) 
alongside of her, under the lee bow. My men tried to cheer when 
| they saw their companions in safety, but their weak cries died 
away in tears and sobbing. . 
| In another half-hour we, too, were alongside of the brigantine. 
From this point I recollect nothing very distinctly. . I remem- 
ber faintly many loud voices and eager faces—J remember fresh, 
_ strong, willing fellows, with a color in their cheeks, and a smart- 
ness in their movements that seemed quite preternatural to me 
at that time, hanging over us in the rigging of the brigantine, and 
dropping down from her sides into our boat—I remember trying 
with my feeble hands to help them in the difficult and perilous 
task of getting the two poor women and the captain on board 
—I remember one dark hairy giant of a man swearing that it was 
enough to break his heart, and catching me in his arms like a 
child—and from that moment I remember nothing more with the 
slightest certainty for over a week oi time. 
When I came to my own senses again, in my cot on board 
the brigantine, my first inquiries were naturally for my fellow- 
sufferers. Two—a passenger in the Long-boat, and one of the 
crew of the Surf-boat—had sunk in spite of all the care that could 
betaken of them. The rest were likely, with time and attention, 
torecover. Of those who have been particularly mentioned in this 
narrative, Mrs. Atherfield had shown signs of rallying the soon- 
sst; Miss Coleshaw, who had held out longer against exhaustion, 
¥as now the slower to recover. Captain Ravender, though slowly '

mending, was still not able to speak or to move in his cot withou 
help. The sacrifices for us all which this good man had so r-*' 
- undergone, not only in the boat, but before that, when he 
deprived himself of his natural rest on the dark nights that _.. 
s ceded the wreck of the Golden Mary, had sadly undermir-7 *i 
natural strength of constitution. He, the heartiest of all 
we sailed from England, was now, through his unwearyin; :)

between life and death.

hide-and-seek round the mast. She squeezed my hand a- * -~* 
she could with her wasted trembling fingers, and looked 
ously in my face, as if she would like to speak to litt 
playfellow, but dared not trust herself—then turned awa: 
and laid her head against the bulwarks, and looked out

I was better pleased when I saw her later in the day, + 
Captain Ravender’s cot; for she seemed to take comfort i 
him. Miss Coleshaw soon afterwards got strong enough

world of good, both in body and spirit, that he also got strong 
enough before long to come on deck, and to thank me, in his old, 
generous, self-forgetful way, for having done my duty—the duty 
which I had learned how to do by his example. 
Hearing what our destination had been when we sailed from 
England, the captain of the brigantine (who had treated us with 
the most unremitting attention and kindness, and had been 
warmly seconded in his efforts for our good by all the people under 
his command) volunteered to go sufficiently out of his course to 
enable us to speak the first Californian coasting-vessel sailing in 
the direction of San Francisco. We were lucky in meeting with 
one of these sooner than we expected. Three days after parting 
from the kind captain of the brigantine, we, the surviving passen- 
gers and crew of the Golden Mary, touched the firm ground once 
more, on the shores of California. 
We were hardly collected here before we were obliged to sep- 
arate again. Captain Ravender, though he was hardly yet in 
good traveling trim, accompanied Mrs. Atherfield inland, to see 
her safe under her husband’s protection. Miss Coleshaw went 
with them, to stay with Mrs. Atherfield for a little while before 
she attempted to proceed with any matters of her own which had 
brought her to this part of the world. The rest of us, who were 
left behind with nothing particular to do until the captain’s 
return, followed the passengers to the gold-diggings. Some few 
of us had enough of the life there in a very short time. The rest 
{seemed bitten by old Mr. Rarx’s mania for gold, and insisted on 
stopping behind when Rames and I proposed going back to the 
port. We two, and five of our steadiest seamen, were all the 
officers and crew left to meet the captain on his return from the 
. foland country. 
He reported that he had left, Mrs. Atherfield and Miss Cole- 
haw safe and comfortable under Mr. Atherfield’s care. They 
at affectionate messages to all of us, and especially (I am proud 
say) to me. After hearing this good news, there seemed 
othing better to do than to ship on board the first vessel bound 
lor England. There were plenty in port, ready to sail and only 
aiting for the men belonging to them who had deserted to the

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Biography. Charles Dickens (1812-1870) was a great English novelist. 
When a mere boy he moved to London, where he afterward lived and wrote. 
As a child he was neglected and his education was limited. He first showed 
his ability to write when he became a reporter for a London newspaper. 
Here his unusual powers of narration and description brought him marked 
success in writing character sketches, which he signed “Boz.” Before 
Dickens was thirty he was the most popular writer in England. He 
attacked the cruelty and.stupidity with which the children of the poor were 
treated in English schools; he opened the eyes of the people to the injustice 
that was suffered by laborers and all poor people; he saw also, like Robert 
Burns, the sincerity and simple happiness that often make the poor more to 
be envied than the rich. No other novelist has invented so many characters 
that seem flesh and blood; they appeal to us because they are “folks,” aot 
imaginary dwellers in an unreal world. You will note this ability and the 
author’s rare power of telling a story, as you read “The Wreck of the Golden 
Mary.” Dickens made two visits to America, where he was received with 
great enthusiasm. His second visit was made in 1867, when he gave public 
readings from his own works. His vivid imagination and keen human sym- 
pathy give to his writings a peculiar interest and charm. 
Discussion. 1, Has Dickeng any purpose in writing this story, except 
to interest and entertain? 2. Are you more interested in the characters, or 
in the things that happen to them; that is, is this tale a character study or 
astory of adventure? 3. Is it both? 4. Does the story contain much con- 
versation, or is it mainly narration? 5. Are there many descriptions 
in it? 6. Are they descriptions of nature, of people, or of events? 7. Read 
what you consider the finest description. 8. What two -persons tell the 
story? 9. Which makes the more decided impression upon you? 10. How 
does Captain Ravender describe himself? 11: Are his words in keeping 
with his education and occupation—such as a self-educated, seafaring 
man would be likely to use? 12. Select and read expressions which indi- 
cate that he is a sailor and uses a sailor’s speech. 13. Name some of the 
Captain’s characteristics and read passages to illustrate each. 14. Notice 
that his character is revealed to us, (1) through his own words in relating 
the story; (2) through what he does; (3) through the conduct of others 
toward him; and (4) through the chief mate’s words. Read lines to illustrate 
each. 15. Which of the other characters is most interesting? 16. Select 
incidents which show the influence upon others of the Captain’s cheerful-

TALES FROM SHAKESPEARE

CHARLES AND MARY LAMB 
During the time that France was divided into provinces (or 
dukedoms as they were called} there reigned in one of these prov- 
inces an usurper, who had deposed and banished his elder brother, 
the lawful duke. 
s The duke, who was thus driven from his dominions, retired 
with a few faithful followers to the forest of Arden; and here the 
good duke lived with his loving friends, who had put themselves 
into a voluntary exile for his sake, while their land and revenues 
enriched the false usurper; and custom soon made the life of care- 
_ 10 less ease they led here more sweet to them than the pomp and 
uneasy splendor of a courtier’s life. Here they lived like the old 
Robin Hood of England, and to this forest many noble youths 
daily resorted from the court, and did fleet the time carelessly, as 
they did who lived in the golden age. In the summer they lay 
1s along under the fine shade of the large forest trees, marking the 
playful sports of the wild deer; and so fond were they of these

themselves with venison for their food. When the cold winds of 
winter made the duke feel the change of his adverse fortune, he 
would endure it patiently, and say, “These chilling winds which 
blow upon my body are true counselors; they do not flatter, but 
s represent truly to me my condition; and though they bite sharply, 
their tooth is nothing like so keen as that of unkindness and in- 
gratitude. I find that howsoever men speak against adversity, 
yet some sweet uses are to be extracted from it; like the jewel, 
precious for medicine, which is taken from the head of the ven- 
10 omous and despised toad.” In this manner did the patient duke 
draw a useful moral from everything that he saw; and by the help 
of this moralizmg turn, in that life of his, remote from public 
haunts, he could find tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, 
sermons in stones, and good in everything. 
1s The banished duke had an only daughter, named Rosalind, 
whom the usurper, Duke Frederick, when he banished her father, 
still retained in his court as a companion for his own daughter 
Celia. A strict friendship subsisted between these ladies, which 
the disagreement between their fathers did not in the least inter- 
20 rupt, Celia striving by every kindness in her power to make 
amends to Rosalind for the injustice of her own father in deposing 
the father of Rosalind; and whenever the thoughts of her father’s 
banishment, and her own dependence on the false usurper, made 
Rosalind melancholy, Celia’s whole care was to comfort and 
es console her. ‘ 
One day, when Celia was talking in her usual kind manner to 
Rosalind, saying, “I pray you, Rosalind, my sweet cousin, be 
merry,” a messenger entered from the duke, to tell them that if 
they wished to see a wrestling match, which was just going to 
30 begin, they must come instantly to the court before the palace; 
_and Celia, thinking it would amuse Rosalind, agreed to go and 
see it. . 
In those times wrestling, which is only practiced now by 
country clowns, was a favorite sport even in the courts of princes, 
36 and before fair ladies and princesses. To this wrestling match, 
therefore, Celia and Rosalind went. They found that it was 
likely to prove a very tragical sight; for a large and powerful man

who had been long practiced in the art of wrestling, and had slain 
many men in contests of this kind, was just going to wrestle with 
avery young man, who, from his extreme youth and inexperience 
| in the art, the beholders all thought would certainly be killed. 
5 When the duke saw Celia and Rosalind, he said, “How now, 
daughter and niece, are you crept hither to see the wrestling? 
You will take little delight in it, there is such odds in the men; in 
pity to this young man, I would wish to persuade him from 
wrestling. Speak to him, ladies, and see if you can not move 
10 him.” 
| The ladies were well pleased to perform this humane office, 
and first Celia entreated the young stranger that he would desist 
| from the attempt; and then Rosalind spoke so kindly to him, and 
| with such feeling consideration for the danger he was about to 
) 8 undergo, that instead of being persuaded by her gentle words to 
| forego his purpose, all his thoughts were bent to distinguish him- 
self by his courage in this lovely lady’s eyes. He refused the 
| request of Celia and Rosalind in such graceful and modest words, 
that they felt still more concern for him; he concluded his refusal 
' 2 with saying, “I am sorry to deny such fair and excellent ladies 
anything. But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me 
to my trial, wherein if I be conquered there is one shamed that 
was never gracious; if I am killed, there is one dead that is willing 
‘to die; I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none to lament 
25 me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing; for I only fill 
up a place in the world which may be better supplied when I have 
made it empty.” 
And now the wrestling match began. Celia wished the young 
stranger might not be hurt; but Rosalind felt most for him. The 
| 80 friendless state which he said he was in, and that he wished to 
die, made Rosalind think that he was like herself, unfortunate; 
and she pitied him so much, and so deep an interest she took in 
his danger while he was wrestling, that she might almost be said 
at that moment to have fallen in love with him. 
ss The kindness shown this unknown youth by these fair and 
noble ladies gave him courage and strength, so that he performed 
wonders; and in the end completely conquered his antagonist,

who was so much hurt, that for a while he was unable to speak 
or move. 
The Duke Frederick was much pleased with the courage and 
skill shown by this young stranger; and desired to know his name 
5 and parentage, meaning to take him under his protection. 
The stranger said his name was Orlando, and that he was the 
youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys. 
Sir Rowland de Boys, the father of Orlando, had been dead 
some years; but when he was living, he had been a true subject 
ao and dear friend of the banished duke; therefore, when Frederick 
heard Orlando was the son of his banished brother’s friend, all his 
liking for this brave young man was changed into displeasure, 
and he left the place in very ill humor. Hating to hear the very 
name of any of his brother’s friends, and yet still admiring the 
as valor of the youth, he said, as he went out, that he wished Orlando 
had been the son of any other man. 
Rosalind was delighted to hear that her new favorite was the 
son of her father’s old friend; and she said to Celia, “My father 
loved Sir Rowland de Boys, and if I had known this young man 
20 was his son, I would have added tears to my entreaties before he 
should have ventured.” 
The ladies then went up to him; and seeing him abashed by 
the sudden displeasure shown by the duke, they spoke kind and 
encouraging words to him; and Rosalind, when they were going 
25 away, turned back to speak some more civil things to the brave 
young son of her father’s old friend; and taking a chain from. off 
her neck, she said, “Gentleman, wear this for me. I am out of 
suits with fortune, or I would give you a more valuable present.” 
When the ladies were alone, Rosalind’s talk being still of 
30 Orlando, Celia began to perceive her cousin had fallen in love 
with the handsome young wrestler, and she said to Rosalind, “Is 
ié possible you should fall in love so suddenly?” Rosalind replied, 
“The duke, my father, loved his father dearly.” “But,” said 
Celia, “does it therefore follow that you shotld love his son 
26 dearly? for then I ought to hate him, for my father hated his 
father; yet I do not hate Orlando.” 
Frederick being enraged at the sight of Sir Rowland de Boys’

  son, which reminded him of the many friends the banished duke 
had among the nobility, and having been for some time displeased 
with his niece, because the people praised her for her virtues and 
pitied her for her good father’s sake, his malice suddenly broke out 
3 against her; and while Celia and Rosalind were talking of Orlando, 
Frederick entered the room, and with looks full of anger ordered 
Rosalind instantly to leave the palace, and follow her father into 
banishment; telling Celia, who in vain pleaded for her, that he had 
only suffered Rosalind to stay upon her account. “TI did not then,” 
10 said Celia, “entreat you to let her stay, for | was too young at that. 
time to value her; but now that I know her worth, and that we so 
long have slept together, risen at the same instant, learned, played, 
and eaten together, I cannot live out of her company.” Fred- 
| erick replied, “She is too subtle for you; her smoothness, her very 
\ 15 silence, and her patience speak to the people, and they pity her. 
{You are a fool to plead for her, for you will seem more bright and. 
| virtuous when she is gone; therefore open not your lips in her 
favor, for the doom which I have passed upon her is irrevo- 
cable.” 
20 When Celia found she could not prevail upon her father to let 
Rosalind remain with her, she generously resolved to accompany 
her; and leaving her father’s palace that night, she went along 
| with her friend to seek Rosalind’s father, the banished duke, in the 
forest of Arden. 
2 Before they set out, Celia considered that it would be unsafe 
for two young ladies to travel in the rich clothes they then wore; 
she therefore proposed that they should disguise their rank by 
dressing themselves like country maids. Rosalind said it would 
be a still greater protection if one of them was to be dressed like a 
| 30 man; and so it was quickly agreed on between them, that as Rosa- 
lind was the taller, she should wear the dress of a young count: ,- 
man, and Celia should be habited like a country lass, and that 
they should say they were brother and sister, and Rosalind said 
she would be called Ganymede, and Celia chose the name of 
35 Aliena. 
In this disguise, and taking their money and jewels to defray 
their expenses, these fair princesses set out on their long travel; . an

  for the forest of Arden was a long way off, beyond the boundaries 
of the duke’s dominions, 
The lady Rosalind (or Ganymede as she must now be called) 
with her marily garb seemed to have put on a manly courage. 
5 The faithful friendship Celia had shown in accompanying Rosa- 
lind so many weary miles, made the new brother, in recompense 
for this true love, exert a cheerful spirit, as if he were indeed 
Ganymede, the rustic and stout-hearted brother of the gentle 
village maiden, Aliena. 
10 When at last they came to the forest of Arden, they no longer 
found the convenient inns and good accommodations they had met 
with on the road; and being in want of food and rest, Ganymede. 
who had so merrily cheered his sister with pleasant speeches ana 
happy remarks all the way, now owned to Aliena that he was so 
1s weary, he could find in his heart to disgrace his man’s apparel, 
and cry like a woman; and Aliena declared she could go no far- 
ther; and then again Ganymede tried to recollect that it was a 
man’s duty to comfort and console a woman, as the weake: 
sel; and to seem courageous to his new sister, he said, “Come 
20 a good heart, my sister Aliena; we are now at the end u: vw 
travel, in the forest of Arden.” But feigned manliness and for 
courage would no longer support them; for though they wer: 
the forest of Arden, they knew not where to find the duke; anu 
here the travel of these weary ladies might have come toa ~ 
2s conclusion, for they might have lost themselves and perishec 
want of food; but providentially, as they were sitting on the grass, 
almost dying with fatigue and hopeless of any relief, a countryman 
chanced to pass that way, and Ganymede once more tried to 
speak with a manly boldness, saying, “Shepherd, if love or gold 
30 can in this desert place procure us entertainment, I pray you 
bring us where we may rest ourselves; for this young maid, my 
sister, is much fatigued with traveling, and faints for want of 
food.” . 
The man replied that he was only a servant to a she 
35 that his master’s house was just going to be sold, anc 
they would find but poor entertainment; but that if tucy wowu 
go with him, they should be welcome to what there was. They
-P-A-G-E-282

followed the man, the near prospect of relief giving them fresh 
( strength; and bought the house and sheep of the shepherd, and 
took the man who conducted them to the shepherd’s house to wait 
on them; and being by this means so fortunately provided with a 
5 neat cottage, and well supplied with provisions, they agreed to 
stay here till they could learn in what part of the forest the duke 
dwelt. . 
When they were rested after the fatigue of their journey, they 
began to like their new way of life, and almost fancied them- 
10 selves the shepherd and shepherdess they feigned to be; yet some- 
times Ganymede remembered he had once been the same lady 
Rosalind who had so dearly loved the brave Orlando, because he 
' was the son of old Sir Rowland, her father’s friend; and though 
| Ganymede thought that Orlando was many miles distant, even 
! 15 so many weary miles as they had traveled, yet it soon appeared 
| that Orlando was also in the forest of Arden; and in this manner 
this. strange event came to pass. 
Orlando was the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys, who, 
when he died, left him (Orlando being then very young) to the 
20 care of his eldest brother Oliver, charging Oliver on his blessing 
to give his brother a good-education, and provide. for him as be- 
came the dignity of their ancient house, Oliver proved an 
unworthy brother; and disregarding the commands of his dying 
father, he never put his brother to school, but kept him at home 
2 untaught and entirely neglected. But in his nature and in the 
| noble qualities of his mind Orlando so much resembled his excel- 
lent father, that without any advantages of education he seemed 
like a youth who had been. bred with the utmost care; and Oliver 
so envied the fine person and dignified manners of his untutored 
30 brother, that at last.he wished to destroy him; and to effect. this 
he set on people to persuade him to wrestle with the famous 
wrestler, who, as has been before related, had killed so many 
men. Now, it was this cruel brother’s neglect of him which 
made Orlando say he wished to die, being so friendless. 
35 When, contrary to the wicked hopes he had formed, his brother 
proved victorious, his envy and malice knew no bounds, and he 
swore he would burn the chamber where Orlando slept. He was 
 
-P-A-G-E-283
    
266 Junior High School Literature, Book One   
overheard making this vow by one that had been an old and faith- 
ful servant to their father, and that loved Orlando because he 
resembled Sir Rowland. This old man went out to meet him when 
he returned from the duke’s palace, and when he saw Orlando, the 
5 peril his dear young master was in made him break out into these 
passionate exclamations: “O my gentle master, my sweet master. 
O you memory of old Sir Rowland! why are you virtuous? why 
are you gentle, strong, and valiant? and why would you be so 
fond to overcome the famous wrestler? Your praise is come too 
10 swiftly home before you.” Orlando, wondering what all this 
meant, asked him what was the matter. And then the old man 
told him how his wicked brother, envying the love all people 
bore him, and now hearing the fame he had gained by his victory 
in the duke’s palace, intended to destroy him, by setting fire to 
15 his chamber that night; and in conclusion, advised him to escape 
the danger he was in by instant flight; and knowing Orlando had 
no money, Adam (for that was the good old man’s name) had 
brought out with him his own little hoard, and he said, “I have 
five hundred crowns, the thrifty hire I saved under your father, 
20 and laid by to be provision for me when my old limbs should 
become unfit for service; take that, and he that doth the ravens 
feed be comfort to my age! Here is the gold; all this I give to 
you; let me be your servant; though I look old I will do the serv- 
ice of a younger man in all your business and necessities.” “O 
25 good old man!” said Orlando, “how well appears in you the con- 
stant service of the old world! You are not for the fashion of 
these times. We will go along together, and before your youth- 
ful wages are spent, I shall light upon some means for both our 
maintenance.” 
30 Together then this faithful servant and his loved master set 
out; and Orlando and Adam traveled on, uncertain what course 
to pursue, till they came to the forest of Arden, and there they 
found themselves in the same distress for want of food that Gany- 
mede and Aliena had been. They wandered on, seeking some 
35 human habitation, till they were almost spent with hunger and: 
fatigue. Adam at last said, “O my dear master, I die for want 
of food; I can go no farther!” He then laid himself down, think-
-P-A-G-E-284
  As You Like It : 267 
l ing to make that place his grave, and bade his dear master fare- 
\ well. Orlando, seeing him in this weak state, took his old servant 
; up in his arms and carried him under the shelter of some pleasant 
trees; and he said to him, “Cheerly, old Adam, rest your weary 
s limbs here awhile and do not talk of dying!” 
Orlando then searched about to find some food, and he hap- 
pened to arrive at that part of the forest where the duke was; 
; and he and his friends were just going to eat their dinner, this 
royal duke being seated on the grass, under no other canopy than 
w the shady covert of some large trees. 
Orlando, whom hunger had made desperate, drew his sword, 
intending to take their meat by force, and said, “Forbear and 
eat no more; I must have your food!” The duke asked him if 
distress had made him so bold, or if he were a rude despiser of 
1s good manners. On this Orlando said he was dying with hunger, 
and then the duke told him he was welcome to sit down and eat 
with them. Orlando hearing him speak so gently, put up his 
sword, and blushed with shame at the rude manner in which he 
had demanded their food. ‘Pardon me, I pray you,” said he; 
2 “I thought. that all things had been savage here, and therefore I 
put on the countenance of stern command; but whatever men you 
are, that in this desert, under the shade of melancholy boughs, lose 
and neglect the creeping hours of time; if ever you have looked 
on better days; if ever you have been where bells have knolled 
; 25 to church; if you have ever sat at any good man’s feast; if ever 
from your eyelids you have wiped a tear, and know what it is to 
pity or be pitied, may gentle speeches now move you to do me 
| human courtesy!” The duke replied, “True it is that we are men 
(as you say) who have seen better days, and though we have now 
| 30 our habitation in this wild forest, we have lived in towns and 
cities, and have with holy bell been knolled to church, have sat 
at good men’s feasts, and from our eyes have wiped the drops 
which sacred pity has engendered; therefore sit you down, and 
take of our refreshments as much as will minister to your wants.” 
35 ‘There is ani old poor man,” answered Orlando, “who has limped 
| after me many a weary step in pure love, oppressed at once with } 
H 
two sad infirmities, age and hunger; till he be satisfied, I must not
-P-A-G-E-285
    268 Junior High School Literature, Book One| 
touch a bit.” “Go, find him out, and bring him hither,” said the 
duke; “we will forbear to eat till you return.” Then Orlando went 
like a doe to find its fawn and give it food; and presently returned, 
bringing Adam in his arms; and the duke said, “Set down your 
& venerable burthen; you are both welcome”; and they fed the old 
man and cheered his heart, and he revived, and recovered his 
health and strength again. 
The duke inquired who Orlando was; and when he found that 
he was the son of his old friend, Sir Rowland de Boys, he took him 
io under his protection, and Orlando and nis old servant lived with 
the duke in the forest, 
Orlando arrived in the forest not many days after Ganymede 
and Aliena came there, and (as has been before related) bought 
the shepherd’s cottage. 
13 Ganymede and Aliena were strangely surprised to: find the 
name of Rosalind carved on the trees, and love-sonnets, fastened 
to them, all addressed to Rosalind; and while they were wonder- 
ing how this could be, they met Orlando, and they perceived the 
chain which Rosalind had given him about his neck. 
20 Orlando little thought that Ganymede was the fair princess 
Rosalind, who, by her noble condescension .and favor, had so 
won his heart. that he passed his whole time in carving her name 
upon the trees, and writing sonnets in praise of her beauty; but 
being much pleased with the graceful air of this pretty shepherd- 
26 youth, he entered into conversation with him, and he thought he 
saw a likeness in Ganymede to his beloved Rosalind, but that he 
had none of the dignified deportment of that noble lady; for 
Ganymede assumed the forward manners often seen in youths 
when they.are between boys and men, and with much archness 
30 and humor talked to Orlando of a certain lover, “who,” said he, 
“haunts our forest, and spoils our young trees with carving, ‘Rosa- 
lind, upon their barks; and he hangs odes upon hawthorns and 
elegies on brambles, all praising this same Rosalind. If I could 
find this lover, I would give him some good counsel that would 
88 goon cure him of his Jove.” 
Orlando confessed that he was the fond lover of whom he 
spoke, and asked Ganymede to give him the good counsel he
-P-A-G-E-286
  
As You Like It. . 269   i 
| ) talked of. The remedy Ganymede proposed, and the counsel he 
| gave him, was that Orlando should come every day to the cot- 
, tage where he and his sister Aliena dwelt. “And then,” said 
Ganymede, “I will feign myself to be Rosalind, and you shall 
5 feign to court me in the same manner as you would do if I was 
Rosalind, and then I will imitate the fantastic ways of whim- 
sical ladies to their lovers, till I make you ashamed of your love; 
and this is the way I propose to cure you.” Orlando had nd 
great faith in the remedy, yet he agreed to come every day to 
:o Ganymede’s cottage, and feign a playful courtship; and every 
day Orlando visited Ganymede and Aliena, and Orlando called 
| the shepherd Ganymede his Rosalind, and every day talked over 
all the fine words and flattering compliments which young men 
| delight to. use when they court their mistresses. It does not ap- 
! 1s pear, however, that Ganymede made any progress in curing 
Orlando of his love for Rosalind. 
Though Orlando thought all this was but a gportive play (not 
| dreaming that Ganymede was his very Rosalind), yet the oppor- 
tunity it gave him of saying all the fond things he had in his heart, 
20 pleased his fancy almost as well as it did Ganymede’s, who en- 
joyed the secret jest in knowing these fine love-speeches were all 
addressed to the right person. 
In this manner many days passed pleasantly on with these 
» young people; and the good-natured Aliena, seeing it made Gany- 
2s mede happy, let him have his own way, and was diverted at the 
mock-courtship, and did not care to remind Ganymede that the 
lady Rosalind had not yet made herself known to the duke her 
father, whose place of resort in the forest they had learnt from 
Orlando. Ganymede met the duke one day, and had some talk 
y 30 with him, and the duke asked of what parentage he came. Gany- 
mede answered that he came of as good parentage as he did, which 
made the duke smile, for he did not suspect the pretty shepherd- 
boy came of royal lineage. Then seeing the duke look well and 
happy, Ganymede was content to put off all further explanation 
i for a few days longer. 
One morning, as Orlando was going to visit Ganymede, he 
saw a man lying asleep on the ground, and a large green snake had
-P-A-G-E-287
270 , Junior High School Literature, Book One 
  twisted itself about his neck. The snake, seeing Orlando approach, 
glided away among the bushes. Orlando went nearer, and then 
he discovered a lioness lie crouching, with her head on the ground, 
with a cat-like watch, waiting until the sleeping man awaked 
s (for it is said that lions will prey on nothing that is dead or 
sleeping). It seemed as if Orlando was sent by Providence to 
free the man from the danger of the snake and lioness; but when 
Orlando looked in the man’s face, he perceived that the sleeper 
who was exposed to this double peril, was his own brother Oliver, 
10 who had so cruelly used him, and had threatened to destroy him 
by fire; and he was almost tempted to leave him a prey to the 
hungry lioness; but brotherly affection and the gentleness of his 
nature soon overcame his first anger against his brother; and he 
drew his sword, and attacked the lioness, and slew her, and thus 
1s preserved his brother’s life both from the venomous snake and 
from the furious lioness; but before Orlando could conquer the 
lioness, she had torn one of his arms with her sharp claws. 
While Orlando was engaged with the lioness, Oliver awaked, 
and perceiving that his brother Orlando, whom he had so cruelly 
20 treated, was saving him from the fury of a wild beast at the risk 
‘of his own life, shame and remorse at once seized him, and he 
repented of his unworthy conduct, and besought with many tears 
his brother’s pardon for the injuries he had done him. Orlando 
rejoiced to see him so penitent, and readily forgave him; they 
25 embraced each other; and from that hour Oliver loved Orlando 
with a true brotherly affection, though he had come to the forest 
bent on his destruction. 
‘The wound in Orlando’s arm having bled very much, he found 
himself too weak to go to visit Ganymede, and therefore he 
30 desired his brother to go and tell Ganymede, “whom,” said Or- 
lando, “I in sport do call my Rosalind,” the accident which had 
befallen him. 
Thither then Oliver went, and told to Ganymede and Aliena 
how Orlando had saved his life; and when he had finished the 
35 story of Orlando’s bravery, and his own providential escape, he 
owned to them that he was Orlando’s brother, who had so cruelly 
used him; and then he told them of their reconciliation.
-P-A-G-E-288
    
As You Like It 271   | 
The sincere sorrow that Oliver expressed for his offenses made 
such a lively impression on the kind heart ‘of Aliena, that she 
» instantly fell in love with him; and Oliver observing how much she 
| pitied the distress he told her he felt for his fault, he as suddenly 
5 fell in love with her. But while love was thus stealing into the 
hearts of Aliena and Oliver, he was no less busy with Ganymede, 
who hearing of the danger Orlando had been in, and that he was 
wounded by the lioness, fainted; and when he recovered, he pre- 
tended that he had counterfeited the swoon in the imaginary char- 
wo acter of Rosalind, and Ganymede said to Oliver, “Tell your 
brother Orlando how well I counterfeited a swoon.” But Oliver 
saw by the paleness of his complexion that he did really faint, 
and much wondering at the weakness of the young man, he said, 
“Well, if you did counterfeit, take a good heart, and counterfeit to 
1s be aman.” “So I do,” replied Ganymede, truly, “but I should 
have been a woman by right.” 
Oliver made this visit a very long one, and when at last he 
returned back to his brother, he had much news to tell him; for 
besides the account of Ganymede’s fainting at the hearing that 
20 Orlando was wounded, Oliver told him how he had fallen in love 
with the fair shepherdess Aliena, and that she had lent a favorable 
ear to his suit, even in this their first interview; and he talked to 
his brother, as of a thing almost settled, that he should marry 
Aliena, saying, that he so well loved her, that he would live here 
% as a shepherd, and settle his estate and house at home upon 
Orlando. 
“You have my consent,” said Orlando. “Let your wedding be 
tomorrow, and I will invite the duke and his friends. Go and per- 
suade your shepherdess to agree to this; she is now alone; for 
30 look, here comes her brother.” Oliver went to Aliena; and Gany~ 
mede, whom Orlando had perceived approaching, came to inquire 
after the health of his wounded friend. 
When Orlando and Ganymede began to talk over the sudden 
love which had taken place between Oliver and Aliena, Orlando 
3s said he had advised his brother to persuade his fair shepherdess 
to be married on the morrow, and then he added how much he 
could wish to be married on the sare day to his Rosalind.   
| | |
-P-A-G-E-289
  
272 Junior High School Literature, Book One   
Ganymede, who well approved of this arrangement, said that 
if Orlando really loved Rosalind as well as he professed to do, he 
should have his wish; for on the morrow he would engage to make 
Rosalind appear in her own person, and also that Rosalind should 
- 8 be willing to marry Orlando. 
This seemingly wonderful event, which, as Ganymede was the 
lady Rosalind, he could so easily perform, he pretended he would 
bring to pass by the aid of magic, which he said he had learnt 
of an uncle who was a famous magician. , 
1o =‘ The fond lover Orlando, half believing and half doubting what 
he heard, asked Ganymede if he spoke in sober meaning. “By my 
life I do,” said Ganymede; “therefore put on your best clothes, 
and bid the duke and your friends to your wedding; for if you 
desire to be married tomorrow to Rosalind, she shall be here.” 
1s The next morning, Oliver having obtained the consent of 
Aliena, they came into the presence of the duke, and with them 
also came Orlando. 
They being all assembled to celebrate this double marriage, 
and as yet only one of the brides appearing, there was much of 
20 wondering and conjecture, but they mostly thought that Gany- 
mede was making a jest of Orlando. 
The duke, hearing that it was his own daughter that was to be 
brought in this strange way, asked Orlando if he believed the 
shepherd-boy could really do what he had promised; and while 
25 Orlando was answering that he knew not what to think, Gany- 
mede entered, and asked the duke, if he brought his daughter, 
“whether he would consent to her marriage with Orlando. “That 
I would,” said the duke, “if I had kingdoms to give with her.” 
Ganymede then said to Orlando, “And you say you will marry her 
30 if I bring her here?” “That I would,” said Orlando, “if I were 
king of many kingdoms.” 
Ganymede and Aliena then went out together, and Ganymede 
throwing off his male attire, and being once more dressed in 
woman’s apparel, quickly became Rosalind without the power of 
85 magic; and Aliena changing her country garb for her own rich 
clothes, was with as little trouble transformed into the lady Cr” 
While they were gone, the duke said to Orlando, that

thought the shepherd Ganymede very like his daughter Rosalind; 
and Orlando said, he also had observed the resemblance. 
, They had no time to wonder how all this would end, for Rosa- 
lind and Celia in their own clothes entered; and no longer pretend- 
s ing that it was by the power of magic that she came there, Rosa- 
lind threw herself on her knees before her. father, and begged his 
blessing. It seemed so wonderful to all present that she should 
so suddenly appear, that it might well have passed for magic; but 
Rosalind would no longer trifle with her father, and told him the 
‘10 story of her banishment, and of her dwelling in the forest as a 
\ shepherd-boy, her cousin Celia passing as her sister.

THE TEMPEST. 
CHARLES AND MARY LAMB 
There was a certain island in the sea, the. only inhabitants 
of which were an old man, whose name was Prospero, and his 
daughter Miranda, a very beautiful young lady. She came to 
this island so young that she had no memory of having seen any 
other human face than her father’s. 
They lived in a cave, or cell, made out of a rock; it was divided 
into several apartments, one of which Prospero called his study; 
there he kept his books, which chiefly treated of magic, a study 
at that time much affected by all learned men. The knowledge 
of this art he found very useful to him; for being thrown by a 
strange chance upon this island, which had been enchanted by a 
witch called Sycorax, who died there a short time before his 
arrival, Prospero, by virtue of his art, released many good spirits 
that Sycorax had imprisoned in the bodies of large trees, because 
they had refused to execute her wicked commands. These gentle 
spirits were ever after obedient to the will of Prospero. Of these 
Ariel was the chief. 
The lively little sprite Ariel had nothing mischievous in his 
nature, except.that he took rather too much pleasure in torment-
-P-A-G-E-293

a S

276 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
ing an ugly monster called Caliban, for he owed him a grudge 
because he was the son of his old enemy Sycorax. This Caliban, 
Prospero found in the woods, a strange misshapen thing, far less 
human in form than an ape. He took him home to his cell, and 
taught him to speak; and Prospero would have been very kind 
to nim, but the bad nature which Caliban mherited from his 
mother Sycorax, would not let him learn anything good or use- 
ful; therefore he was employed like a slave, to fetch wood, and 
do the most laborious offices; and Ariel had the charge of com- 
pelling him to these services. 
When Caliban was lazy and neglected his work, Ariel (who 
was invisible to all eyes but Prospero’s) would come slyly and 
pinch him, and sometimes tumble him down in the mire; and then 
Ariel, in the likeness of an ape, would make mouths at him. 
Then swiftly changing his shape, in the likeness of a hedgehog, 
he would lie tumbling in Caliban’s way, who feared the hedgehog’s 
sharp quills would prick his bare feet. With a variety of such- 
like vexatious tricks Ariel would often torment him, whenever 
Caliban neglected the work which Prospero commanded him to do. 
Having these powerful spirits obedient to his will, Prospero 
could by their means command the winds, and. the waves of the 
sea. By his orders they raised a violent storm, in the midst of 
which, and struggling with the wild sea-waves that every moment 
threatened to swallow it up, he showed his daughter a fine large 
ship, which he told her was full of living beings like themselves. 
“O my dear father,” said she, “if by your art: you have raised 
this dreadful storm, have pity on their sad distress. See! the ves- 
sel will be dashed to pieces. Poor souls! they will all perish. If 
I had power, I would sink the sea beneath the earth, rather than 
the good ship should be destroyed, with al: the precious souls 
within her.” 
“Be not so amazed, daughter Miranda,” said Prospero; “there 
is no harm done. I have so ordered it, that no person in the ship 
shall receive any hurt. What I have done has been in care of 
you, my dear child. You are ignorant who you are, or where you 
came from, and you know no more of me but that I am your 
father, and live in this poor cave. Can you remember a time
-P-A-G-E-294
  The Tempest 277 
  before you came to this cell? I think you cannot, for you were 
not then three years of age.” 
“Certainly I can, sir,” replied Miranda. 
“By what?” asked Prospero; “by any other house or person? 
5 Tell me what you can remember, my child.” 
Miranda said, “It seems to me like the recollection of a dream. 
But had I not once four or ‘five women who attended upon me?” 
Prospero answered, “You had, and more. How is it that this 
still lives in your mind? Do you remember how you came here?” 
“No, sir,” said Miranda, “I remember nothing more.” 
“Twelve years ago, Miranda,” continued Prospero, “I was 
duke of Milan, and you were a princess, and my only heir. I had 
a younger brother, whose name was Antonio, to whom I trusted 
everything; and as I was fond of retirement and deep study, I 
commonly left the management of my state affairs to your uncle, 
my false brother (for so indeed he proved). I, neglecting all 
worldly ends, buried among my books, did dedicate my whole 
time to the bettering of my mind. My brother Antonio being thus 
in possession of my power, began to think himself the duke indeed. 
The opportunity I gave him of making himself popular among 
my subjects awakened in his bad nature a proud ambition to 
deprive me of my dukedom; this he soon effected with the aid 
of the king of Naples, a powerful prince, who was my enemy.” 
“Wherefore,” said Miranda, “did they not that hour destroy 
us?” 
“My child,” answered her father, “they durst not, so dear was 
the love that my people bore me. Antonio carried us on board 
a ship, and when we were some leagues out at sea, he forced us 
into a small boat, without either tackle, sail, or mast; there he 
left us, as he thought, to perish. But a kind lord of my court, 
one Gonzalo, who loved me, had privately placed in the boat, 
water, provisions, apparel, and some books which I prize above my 
dukedom.” 
“O my father,” said Miranda, ‘ ‘what a trouble must I have 
been to you then!” 
“No, my love,” said Prospero, “you were a little cherub that, 
did preserve me. Your innocent smiles made me bear up against

my misfortunes. Our food lasted till we landed on this *-~~ 
island, since when my chief delight has been in teaching 
Miranda, and well have you profited by my instructions.” 
“Heaven thank you, my dear father,” said Miranda. “No 
pray tell me, sir, your. reason for raising this sea-storm?” 
“Know then,” said her father, “that by means of this storm 
my enemies, the King of Naples and my cruel brother, are cas 
ashore upon this island.” 
Having so said, Prospero gently touched his daughte 
his magic wand, and she fell fast asleep; for the spirit Ari 
then presented himself before his master, to give an accou.. .

to her) with the empty air. 
“Well, my brave spirit,” said Prospero to Ariel, “how have yo 
performed your task?” 
Ariel gave a lively description of the storm, and of the terro 
of the mariners; and how the King’s son, Ferdinand, was tk 
who leaped into the sea; and his father thought he saw hi:

“How now!” said Prospero. “You do not recollect what a 
3 torment I freed you from. Have you forgot the wicked witch 
Sycorax, who with age and envy was almost bent double? Where 
was she born? Speak; tell me.’ 
“Sir, in Algiers,” said Ariel. 
, “O was she so?” said Prospero. “I must recount what you 
t ko have been, which I find you do not remember. This bad witch,

if “Pardon me, dear master,” said Ariel, ashamed to seem un- 
| * grateful; “I will obey your commands.” 
“Do so,” said Prospero, “and I will set you free.” He then 
gave orders what further he would have him do; and away went 
Ariel, first to where he had left Ferdinand, and found him still 
sitting on the grass in the same melancholy posture. 
“O my young gentleman,” said Ariel, when he saw him, “I will 
soon move you. You must be brought, I find, for the Lady 
r Miranda to have a sight of your pretty person, Come, sir, follow e,” He then began singing, 
  “Full fathom five thy father lies; 
Of his bones are coral made; 
Those are pearls that were his eyes. 
Nothing of him that doth fade, 
But doth suffer a sea-change 
Into something rich and strange. 
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell ; 
Hark! now I hear them,—Ding-dong, bell.” 
This strange news of his lost father soon roused the prince 
from the stupid fit into which he had fallen. He followed in 
amazement the sound of Ariel’s voice, till it led him to Prospero 
[= Miranda, who were sitting under the shade of a large tree.

Now Miranda had never seen a man before, except her own 
father. 
“Miranda,” said Prospero, “tell me what you are looking at 
yonder.” . 
“O father,” said Miranda, in a strange surprise, “surely 
is a spirit. Lord! how it looks about! Believe me, sir, il 
beautiful creature. Is it not a spirit?” 
“No, girl,” answered her father; “it eats, and sleey 
senses such as we have. This young man you sce was

Miranda, who thought all men had grave faces end o--~

beautiful young prince; and Ferdinand, seeing such 
in this desert place, and from the strange sounds hi 
expecting nothing but wonders, thought he was upon : 
island, and that Miranda was the goddess of the p 
such he began to address her. 
She timidly answered, she was no goddess, but a sir 
and was going to give him an account of herself, wher 
interrupted her. He was well pleased to find they adi 
other, for he plainly perceived they had (as we say) *-"-- ~

“IT will resist such entertainment, till I see a mi

ungentle? Have pity, sir; I will be his surety. This is the seco 
man I ever saw, and to me he seems a true one.”

“Silence,” said the father; ‘“‘one word more will make me chide 
you, girl! What! an advocate for an impostor! You think there 
are no more such fine men, having seen only him and Caliban. 
{ I tell you, foolish girl, most men as far excel this, as he does 
3 Caliban.” This he said to prove his daughter’s constancy; and 
she replied, “My affections are most humble. I have no wish 
to see a-goodlier man.” : 
“Come on, young man,” said Prospero to the Prince; “you 
have no power to disobey me.’ / : 
to “TI have not indeed,” answered Ferdinand; and not knowing 
| that it was by magic he was deprived of all power of resistance, 
he was astonished to find himself so strangely compelled to fol-

P are all bound up, as if I were in a dream; but this man’s threats, 
and the weakness which I feel, would seem light to me if from 
| my prison I might once a day behold this fair maid.” 
Prospero kept Ferdinand not long confined within the cell; he 
soon brought out his prisoner, and set him a severe task to per- 
form, taking care to let his daughter know the hard labor he 
had imposed on him, and then pretending to go into his study, he 
secretly watched them both. 
Prospero had commanded Ferdinand to pile up some heavy 
logs of wood. Kings’ sons not being much used to laborious work, 
Miranda soon after found her lover almost dying with fatigue. 
“Alas!” said she, “do not work so hard; my father is at his studies, 
he is safe for these three hours; pray rest yourself.” 
“O my dear lady,” said Ferdinand, “I dare not. I must finish 
yy task before I take my rest.” 
“If you will sit down,” said Miranda, “I will carry your logs 
ae while.” But this Ferdinand would by no means. agree to. 
aostead of a help Miranda became a hindrance, for they began 
long conversation, so that the business of log-carrying went 
avery slowly. 
Prospero, who had enjoined Ferdinand this task merely as a 
tial of his love, was not at his books, as his daughter supposed, 
ut was standing by them invisible, to overhear what they said.

Ferdinand inquired her name, which she told, saying it wa: 
against her father’s express command she did so. 
Prospero only smiled at this first instance of hi 
disobedience, for having by his magic art caused | 
to fall in love so suddenly, he was not angry that

well pleased to a long speech of Ferdinand’s, in wlicu uc piu

  and this command Miranda seemed not at all disposed to 
disobey. 
When Prospero left them, he called his spirit Ariel, who 
{ quickly appeared before him, eager to relate what he had done 
s with Prospero’s brother and the King of Naples. Ariel said he 
had left them almost out of their senses with fear, at the strange 
things he had caused them to see and hear. When fatigued with 
wandering about, and famished for want of food, he had suddenly 
|| set before them a delicious banquet, and then, just as they were 
0 going to eat, he appeared visible before them in the shape of 
_{ aharpy, a voracious monster with wings, and the feast vanished 
) away, Then, to their utter amazement, this seeming harpy spoke 
| to them, reminding them of their cruelty in driving Prospero from 
is dukedom, and leaving him and his infant daughter to perish 
in the sea; saying, that for this cause these terrors were suffered 
0 afflict them. 
The King of Naples, and Antonio, the false brother, repented 
the injustice they had done to Prospero; and Ariel told his master 
he was certain their penitence was sincere, and that he, though a 
© spirit, could not but pity them. 
“Then bring them hither, Ariel,” said Prospero; “if you, who 
are but a spirit, feel for their distress, shall not I, who am a human 
being like themselves, have compassion on them? Bring them, 
quickly, my dainty Ariel.” 
6 Ariel soon returned with the King, Antonio, and old Gonzalo 
in their train, who had followed him, wondering at the wild music 
e played in the air to draw them on to his master’s presence. 
This Gonzalo was the same who had so kindly provided Prospero 
ormerly with books and provisions, when his wicked brother

  Grief and terror had so stupefied their senses, that they did 
not know Prospero. He first discovered himself to the good old 
Gonzalo, calling him the preserver of his life; and then his brother 
| and the King knew that he was the injured Prospero. 
Antonio with tears, and sad words of sorrow and true repent- 
ance, implored his brother’s forgiveness, and the King expressed 
his sincere remorse for having assisted Antonio to depose his

  brother; and Prospero forgave them; and, upon their engaging to 
restore his dukedom, he said to the King of Naples, “I have a gift 
in store for you, too”; and opening a door, showed him his son 
Ferdinand playing at chess with Miranda. 
Nothing could exceed the joy of the father and the son at this 
unexpected meeting, for they each thought the other drowned in 
the storm. 
“O wonder!” said Miranda, “what noble creatures these are! 
It must surely be a brave world that has such people in it.” 
The King of Naples was almost as much astonished at the 
beauty and excellent graces of the young Miranda, as his son 
had been. “Who is this maid?” said he; “she seems the goddess 
that has parted us, and brought us thus together.” ‘No, sir,” 
answered Ferdinand, smiling to find his father had fallen into the 
same mistake that he had done when he first saw Miranda, “she 
is a mortal, but by immortal Providence she is mine; I chose her 
when I could not ask you, my father, for your consent, not think- 
ing you were alive. She is the daughter to this Prospero, who is 
the famous duke of Milan, of whose renown I have heard so. 
much, but never saw him till now; of him I have received a new 
life: he has made himself to me a second father, giving me this 
dear lady.” 
“Then I must. be her father,” said the King; “but oh! how 
oddly will it sound, that I must ask my child forgiveness.” 
“No more of that,” said Prospero; “let us not remember our 
troubles past, since they so happily have ended.” And then Pros- 
pero embraced his brother, and again assured him of his for- 
giveness; and said that a wise over-ruling Providence had per- 
mitted that he should be driven from his poor dukedom of Milan, 
that his daughter might inherit the crown of Naples, for that by 
their meeting in this desert island, it had happened that the King’s 
son had loved Miranda. 
These kind words which Prospero spoke, meaning to comfort 
his brother, so filled Antonio with shame and remorse, that he 
wept and was unable to speak; and the kind old Gonzalo wept to 
see this joyful reconciliation, and prayed. for blessings on the 
young couple.

  Prospero now told them that their ship was safe in the har- 
bor, and the sailors all on board her, and that he and his daugh- 
ter would accompany them home the next morning. “In the 
meantime,” says he, “partake of such refreshments as my poor 
cave affords; and for your evening’s entertainment I will relate 
the history of my life from my first landing in this desert island.” 
He then called for Caliban to prepare some food, and set the cave 
m order; and the company were astonished at the uncouth form 
and savage appearance of this ugly monster, who (Prospero said) 
was the only attendant he had to wait upon him. 
Before Prospero left the island, he dismissed Ariel from his 
service, to the great joy of that lively little spirit; who, though 
he had been a faithful servant to his master, was always longing 
to enjoy his free liberty, to wander uncontrolled in the air, like 
a wild bird, under green trees, among pleasant fruits, and sweet- 
smelling flowers. “My quaint Ariel,” said Prospero to the little 
sprite when he made him free, “I shall miss you; yet you shall 
have your freedom.” “Thank you, my dear master,” said Ariel; 
“but give me leave to attend your ship home with prosperous 
gales, before you. bid farewell to the assistance of your faithful 
spirit; and then, master, when I am free, how merrily I shall 
live!” Here Ariel sang this pretty song: 
“Where the bee sucks, there suck I; 
In a cowslip’s bell I lie; 
There I crouch when owls do ery. 
On the bat’s back I do fly 
After summer merrily. 
Merrily, merrily shall I live now 
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.” 
Prospero then buried deep in the earth his magical books and 
wand, for he was resolved never more to make'use of the magic 
art. And having thus overcome his enemies, and being reconciled 
to his brother and the King of Naples, nothing now remained to 
complete his happiness, but to revisit his native land, to take 
possession of his dukedom, and to witness the happy nuptials of 
his daughter and Prince Ferdinand, which the King said should 
be instantly celebrated with great splendor on their return to

your life, to keep this inheritance and to hand it on to those who 
will speak the English tongue when you are dead. 
Only a few bits of the story can be given here. You will 
read something about Scotland’s struggle for the right to be 
governed by her own people, not by the tyrannical kings who 
then ruled England and who looked upon Scotiand as a mere 
province fit only to supply money for their selfish desires. Next 
you will read several selections which show that the tyranny 
against which Wallace and Bruce fought, like the tyranny against 
which Warren and Washington and Patrick Henry fought, did not 
spring from the English spirit, but from kings who tried to keep 
even Englishmen in slavery. It is all one story—at one time the 
action takes place in Scotland, at another in England, at still 
‘another time in America; but the story is the story of our 
inheritance of freedom. 
“We must be free or die”’—these words express the spirit of 
all who speak the English tongue. The stories of Wallace and 
Bruce tell it. The story of the last fight of the Revenge tells 
it—a story written by the man who first began to plant English 
colonies in America, and who helped defend England against 
the tyranny.which King Philip of Spain tried to establish. The 
stories of the Gray Champion, and of Warren at Bunker Hill, 
and of Patrick Henry of Virginia, and of Washington and Marion, 
are also a part of the great story of our inheritance of freedom. 
‘You should keep this always in mind: the heroes who made 
good the Declaration of Independence and set up a new and freer 
government in America were men whose ideals of freedom came to 
them from England. They did not fight against the English 
people. Their spirit was also the fundamental English spirit. 
Many of the greatest Englishmen of that period used every effort 
to win fair treatment for the colonies, sympathized with their 
struggle for independence and rejoiced when at last George III and 
his ministers were told that America would no longer submit to 
oppression. 
One of the greatest of these Englishmen was Edmund Burke, 
who lived in the time of George III and toc : the part of the colo- 
nies in their struggle against the King’s tyranny. He worked for

  1 of the taxation laws that so offended the Americans. 
' many speeches in Parliament and elsewhere pleading 
‘lishmen not to drive their fellow Englishmen into civil 
d when at last war came, Burke still sought to bring 
about reconciliation. He wrote the King a letier in which he 
said that the British governfhent was not representing the British 
spirit of freedom in its dealings with the colonies. He wrote a 
letter to the colonies in which he begged them not to believe that 
they were at war with England. “Do not think,” he said, “that 
the whole or even the majority of Englishmen in the island are 
enemies to their own blood on the American continent.” And 
a little later he said, “But still a large, and we trust the largest 
and soundest part of this kingdom perseveres in the most per- 
fect unity of sentiments, principles, and affections with you. It 
spreads out a large and liberal platform of common liberty upon 
which we may all unite forever.” The whole matter he sums up 
by saying that the spirit of England loves not.conquest ot vast 
empire for the sake of wealth, but “this is the peculiar glory of 
England: those who have and who hold to that foundation of com- 
mon liberty, whether on this or on your side of the ocean, we 
consider as the true, and the only true, Englishmen.” 
All Americans need to remember these words written by a great 
friend of the colonies during the Revolutionary War, a man who 
also explained more clearly and more eloquently than any other 
Englishman in any time the principles on which our inheritance 
of freedom rests. His interest in the American cause was not 
merely the interest of a sympathetic friend; over and over again 
he pointed out that the colonies, and not the King’s ministry, 
represented the true English spirit. To him the mode of self- 
government set up in Massachusetts and Virginia represented 
the very ideal for which patriotic Englishmen had struggled for 
centuries. The British parliament, in Burke’s time, was not 
made up of representatives from all the population; only a small 
part of the population could vote, and many districts had no 
representation at all. Complete control of the government by 
the people was what Burke and thousands of other Englishmen 
had been trying to win. In America such a form of popular

SCOTLAND’S STRUGGLE FOR 
INDEPENDENCE 
  TALES OF A GRANDFATHER 
sIR WALTER SCOTT 
Tue Story or Sir WintiAM WALLACE 
(1296-1805) 
William Wallace was none of the high nobles of Scotland, but 
the son of a private gentleman, called Wallace of Ellerslie, in 
Renfrewshire, near Paisley. He was very tall and handsome, 
and one of the strongest and bravest men that ever lived. He 
s had a very fine countenance, with a quantity of fair hair, and 
was particularly dexterous in the use of all weapons which were 
then employed in battle. Wallace, like all Scotsmen of high 
spirit, had looked with great indignation upon the usurpation of 
the crown by Edward, and upon the insolences which the Englieh 
w soldiers committed on his countrymen. It is said, that when he 
was very young, he went a-fishing for sport in the river of Irvine, 
near Ayr. He had caught a good many trout, which were carried 
by a boy, who attended him with a fishing-basket, as is usual 
with anglers. Two or three English soldiers, who belonged to the 
8 garrison of Ayr, came up to Wallace, and insisted, with their 
usual insolence, on taking the fish from the boy. Wallace was 
contented to allow them a part of the trout, but he refused to 
art with the whole basketful. The soldiers insisted, and from 
words came to blows. Wallace had no better weapon than the

butt-end of his fishing rod; but he struck the foremost of the Eng- 
lishmen so hard under the ear with it that he killed him on the 
spot; and getting possession of the slain man’s sword, he fought 
with so much fury that he put the others to flight, and brought 
home his fish safe and sound. The English governor of Ayr 
sought for him, to punish him with death for this action; but 
Wallace lay concealed among the hills and great woods till the 
matter was forgotten. 
But the action which occasioned his finally rising in arms is 
believed to have happened in the town of Lanark. Wallace was 
at this time married to a lady of that place, and residing there 
with his wife. It chanced, as he walked in the market-place, 
dressed in a green garment, with a rich dagger by his side, that 
an Englishman came up and insulted him on account of his 
finery, saying a Scotsman had no business to wear so gay a dress, 
or carry so handsome a weapon. It soon came to a quarrel, and 
Wallace, having killed the Englishman, fled to his own house 
which was speedily assaulted by all the English soldiers, While 
they were endeavoring to force their way in at the front of the 
house, Wallace escaped by a back door, and got in safety to a 
rugged and rocky glen, near Lanark, called the Cartland Crags, 
all covered with bushes and trees, and full of high precipices, 
where he knew he should be safe from the pursuit of the English 
soldiers. In the meantime the governor of Lanark, whose name 
was Hazelrigg, burned Wallace’s house and put his wife and 
servants to death; and by committing this cruelty, increased to 
the highest pitch, as you may well believe, the hatred which the 
champion had always borne against the English usurper. Hazel- 
rigg also proclaimed Wallace an outlaw, and offered a reward to 
any one who should bring him to an English garrison, alive or 
dead. 
On the other hand, Wallace soon collected a body of men, out- 
lawed like himself, or willing to become so, rather than any 
longer endure the oppression of the English. One of his earliest 
expeditions was directed against Hazelrigg, whom he killed, and 
thus avenged the death of his wife. He fought skirmishes with 
the soldiers who were sent against him, and often defeated them;

ene On SSE 
and in time became so well known and so formidable, that mul- 
titudes began to resort to his standard, until at length he was at 
the head of a considerable army, with which he proposed to 
restore his country to independence. : 
Thus Wallace’s party grew daily stronger and stronger, and 
many of the Scottish nobles joined with him. Among these was 
Sir William Douglas, the Lord of Douglasdale, and the head of 
a great family often mentioned in Scottish history. There was 
also Sir John the Grahame, who became Wallace's bosom friend 
and greatest confidant. Many of these great noblemen, however, 
deserted the cause of the country on the approach of John de 
Warenne, Earl of Surrey, the English governor, at the head of a 
numerous and well-appointed army. They thought that Wallace 
would be unable to withstand the attack of so many disciplined 
soldiers and hastened to submit themselves to the English, for 
fear of losing their estates. Wallace, however, remained undis- 
mayed, and at the head of a considerable army. He had taken 
up his camp upon the northern side of the river Forth, near the 
town of Stirling. The river was there crossed by a long wooden 
bridge, about a mile above the spot where the present bridge is 
situated. 
The English general approached the banks of the river on the 
southern side. He sent two clergymen to offer a pardon to Wal- 
lace and his followers, on condition that they should lay down 
their arms. But such was not the purpose of the high-minded 
champion of Scotland. 
“Go back to Warenne,” said Wallace, “and tell him we value 
not the pardon of the King of England. We are not here for the 
purpose of treating for peace, but of abiding battle, and restor- 
ing freedom to our country. Let the English come on; we defy 
them to their very beards!” . 
The English, upon hearing this haughty answer, called loudly 
to be led to the attack. The Earl of Surrey hesitated, for he was 
a skillful soldier, and he saw the’ to approach the Scottish army, 
his troops must pass over the lon, narrow, wooden bridge; so 
that those who should get over first might be attacked by Wallace 
with all his forces, before those who remained behind could pos-

  sibly come to their assistance. He therefore inclined to delay 
‘the battle. But Cressingham the Treasurer, who was ignorant 
and presumptuous, insisted that it was their duty to fight and 
put an end to the war at once; and Surrey gave way to his opin- 
ion, although Cressingham, being a churchman, could not be so 
good a judge of what was fitting as he himself, an experienced 
officer. 
The English army began to cross the bridge, Cressingham 
leading the van, or foremost division of the army; for, in those 
military days, even clergymen -wore armor and fought in battle. 
That took place which Surrey had foreseen. . Wallace suffered a 
considerable part of the English army to pass the bridge, without 
offering any opposition; but when about one-half were over, and 
the bridge was crowded with those who were following, he charged 
those who had erossed, with his whole strength, slew a very great 
number, and drove the rest into the river Forth, where the greater 
part were drowned. The remainder of the English army, who 
were left on the southern bank of the river, fled in great confusion, 
having first set fire to the wooden bridge, that the Scots might 
not pursue them. Cressingham was killed in the very beginning 
of the battle. / 
The remains of Surrey’s great army fled out of Scotland after 
this defeat, and the Scots, taking arms on all sides, attacked the 
castles in which the English soldiers continued to shelter them- 
selves, and took most of them by force or stratagem. Many won- 
derful stories are told of Wallace’s exploits on these occasions, 
some of which are no doubt true, while others are either invented 
or very much exaggerated. It seems certain, however, that he 
defeated the English in several combats, chased them almost 
entirely out of Scotland, regained the towns and castles of which 
they had possessed themselves, and recovered for a time the 
complete freedom of the country. 
Edward I was in Flanders when all these events took place. 
You may suppose he was very angry when he learned that Scot- 
land, which he thought completely subdued, had risen into a great 
tusurrection against him, defeated his armies, killed his Treasurer, 
chased his soldiers out of their country, and invaded England with
-P-A-G-E-314

a great force. He came back from Flanders in a mighty rage, 
and determined not to leave that rebellious country until it was 
finally conquered, for which purpose he assembled a very’ fine 
army and marched into Scotland. 
In the meantime the Scots prepared to defend themselves, and 
chose Wallace to be Governor, or Protector, of the kingdom, be- 
cause they had no king at the time. He was now titled Sir Wil- 
liam Wallace, Protector, or Governor, of the Scottish nation. 
But although Wallace, as we have seen, was the best soldier and 
bravest man in Scotland, and therefore the most fit to be placed 
in command at this critical period, when the King of England was 
coming against them with such great forces, yet the nobles of 
Scotland envied him this important situation, because he was not 
a man born in high rank, or enjoying a large estate. So great 
was their jealousy of Sir William Wallace, that many of these 
great barons did not seem very willmg to bring forward their 
forces, or fight against the English, because they would not have 
a man of inferior condition to be general. Yet, notwithstanding 
this unwillingness of the great nobility to support him, Wallace 
assembled a large army ; for the middling, but especially the lower 
classes, were very much attached to him. He marched beldly 
against the King of England, and met him near the town ef Fal- 
kirk. Most of the Scottish army were on foot, beeause, as I 
already told you, in those days only the nobility and great men 
of Scotland fought on horseback. The English King, on the con- 
trary, had a very large body of the finest cavalry in the world, 
Normans and English, all clothed in complete armor. He had 
also the celebrated archers of England, each of whom was said to 
carry twelve Scotsmen’s lives under his girdle; because every 
archer had twelve arrows stuck in his belt, and was expected to 
kill a man with every arrow. 
The Scots had some good archers from the Forest of Ettrick, 
who fought under command of Sir John Stewart of Bonkill; 
but they were not nearly equal in number to the English. The 
greater part of the Scottish army were on foot, armed with long 
spears; they were placed thick and close together, and laid 
all their ‘spears so close, point over point, that it seemed as

difficult to break through them, as through the wall of a strong 
castle. . 
The English made the attack. King Edward, though he saw 
the clese ranks, and undaunted appearance, of the Scottish in- 
fantry, resolved nevertheless to try whether he could not ride 
them down with his fine cavalry. He therefore gave his horse- 
men orders to advance. They charged accordingly at full gallop. 
The first line of cavalry was commanded by the Earl Marshal 
of England, whose progress was checked by a morass. The sec- 
ond line of English horse was commanded by Antony Beck, the 
Bishop of Durham, who nevertheless wore armor and fought 
like a lay baron. He wheeled round the morass; but when he saw 
the deep and firm order of the Scots, his heart failed, and he pro- 
posed to Sir Ralph Basset of Drayton, who commanded under 
him, to halt till Edward himself brought up the reserve. “Go say 
your mass, Bishop,” answered Basset contemptuously, and ad- 
vanced at full gallop with the second line. However, the Scots 
stood their ground with their long spears; many of the foremost 
of the English horses were thrown down, and the riders were killed 
as they lay rolling, unable to rise, owing to the weight of their 
heavy armor. The English cavalry attempted again and again 
to disperse the deep and solid ranks in which Wallace had sta- 
tioned his foot soldiers. But they were repeatedly beaten off with 
loss, nor could they make their way through that wood of spears, 
as it is called by one of the English historians. King Edward 
then commanded his archers to advance; and these approaching 
within arrow-shot of the Scottish ranks, poured on them such close 
and dreadful volleys of arrows, that it was impossible to sustain 
the discharge. It happened at the same time, that Sir John Stew- 
art was killed by a fall from his horse; and the archers of Ettrick 
Forest, whom he was bringing forward to oppose those of King 
Edward, were slain in great numbers around him. Their bodies 
were afterward distinguished among the slain, as being the tallest 
and. handsomest men of the army. 
The Scottish spearmen being thus thrown into some degree of 
confusion, by the loss of those who were slain by the arrows of 
the English, the heavy cavalry of Edward again charged with

  more success than formerly, and broke through the ranks, which 
were already disordered. Sir John Grahame, Wallace’s great 
friend and companion, was slain, with many other brave soldiers; 
{ and the Scots, having lost a very great number of men, were at 
length obliged to take to flight. 
The King of England possessed so much wealth, and so many 
means of raising soldiers, that he sent army after army into the 
poor oppressed country of Scotland, and obliged all its nobles and 
great men, one after another, to submit themselves once more to 
to his yoke. Sir William Wallace, alone, or with a very small band 
of followers, refused either to acknowledge the usurper Edward, 
r to lay down his arms. He continued to maintain himself 
mong the woods and mountains of his native country for no less 
aan seven years after his defeat at Falkirk, and for more than 
ne year after all the other defenders of Scottish liberty had laid . 
own their arms. Many proclamations were sent out against him. 
y the English, and a great reward was set upon his head; for 
‘dward did not think he could have any secure possession of his 
surped kingdom of Scotland while Wallace lived. At length he 
as taken prisoner; and, shame it to say, a Scotsman called Sir 
ohn Monteith was the person by whom he was seized and deliv- 
zed to the English. 
Edward, having thus obtamed possession of the person whom 
e considered as the greatest obstacle to his complete conquest; of 
cotland, resolved to make Wallace an example to all Scottish 
atriots who should in future venture to oppose his ambitious 
rojects. He caused this gallant defender of his country to be 
cought to trial in ‘Westminster Hall, before the English judges, 
ad produced him there, crowned in mockery, with a green gar- 
30 tand, because they said he had been king of outlaws and robbers 
among the Scottish woods. Wallace was accused of having been 
a traitor to the English crown; to which he answered, “I could 
not be a traitor to Edward, for I was never his subject.” He 
was then charged with having taken and burned towns and castles, 
* with having killed many men and done much violence. He re- 
plied, with the same calm resolution, that it was true he had 
killed many Englishmen, but it was because they had come to o

  subdue and oppress his native country of Scotland; and far from 
repenting what he had done, he declared he was only sorry that 
he had not put to death many more of them. 
Notwithstanding that Wallace’s defense was a good. one, both 
in law and in common sense (for surely every one has not only 
a right to fight in defense of his native country, but is bound in 
duty to do so), the English judges condemned him to be executed. 
NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Biography. Walter Scott (1771-1832) was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. 
Even in his childhood he loved nothing better than to wander through 
Scotland, looking up castles and ruins and listening to the stories connected 
with them as told by the old people of the villages. He became familiar 
with all the ballads and legends of his locality, and these, with Bishop 
Percy’s collection of ballads which he read later, exerted a strong influence 
on his life. He loved the history and romance of Scotland and made them 
known to all the world through his poems and novels. 
In 1827 he published the Tales of a Grandfather, because, as he writes 
in his diary, the good thought came to him to write stories from the history 
of Scotland for his grandson, John Hugh Lockhart, whom he calls Hugh 
Littlejohn. “Children hate books which are written down to their capacity, 
and love those that are composed more for their elders, “I will,” he says, 
“make, if possible, a book that a child shall understand, yet a man will feel 
some temptation to peruse should he chance to take it up.”

  Robert the Bruce . 301 
Rosert THE Bruce 
(1305-1313) 
Robert Bruce, Earl of Carrick, and John Comyn, usually 
called the Red Comyn, two great and powerful barons, had taken 
part with Sir William Wallace in the wars against England; but, 
after the defeat of Falkirk, being fearful of losing their great 
estates, and considering the freedom of Scotland as beyond the 
possibility of being recovered, both Bruce and Comyn had not 
only submitted themselves to Edward, and acknowledged his title 
as King of Scotland, but even borne arms, along with the English, 
against such of their countrymen as still continued to resist the 
usurper. But the feelings of Bruce concerning the baseness of 
this conduct are said, by the old tradition of Scotland, to have 
been awakened by the following incident. In one of the numer- 
ous battles, or skirmishes, which took place at the time between 
the English and their adherents on the one side, and the insurgent, 
or patriotic, Scots upon the other, Robert the Bruce was present, 
and assisted the English to gain the victory. After the battle 
was over, he sat down to dinner among his southern friends and 
allies, without washing his hands, on which there still remained 
spots of the blood which he had shed during the action. The Eng- 
lish lords, observing this, whispered to each other in mockery, 
“Look at that Scotsman, who is eating his own blood!” Bruce 
heard what they said, and began to reflect that the blood upon 
his hands might be indeed called his own, since it was that of his 
brave countrymen who were fighting for the independence of 
Scotland, whilst he was assisting its oppressors, who only laughed 
at and mocked him for his unnatural conduct. He was so much 
shocked and disgusted, that he arose from table, and, going into 
a neighboring chapel, shed many tears, and asking pardon of 
God for the great crime he had been guilty of, made a solemn 
vow that he would atone for it, by doing all in his power to deliver 
Scotland from the foreign yoke. Accordingly, he left, it is said, 
the English army, and never joined it again, but remained watch- 
ing an opportunity for restoring the freedom of his country.

Now, this Robert the Bruce was a remarkably brave and 
strong man; there was no man in Scotland that was thought a 
match for him except Sir William Wallace; and now that Wallace 
was dead, Bruce was held the best warrior in Scotland. He was 
very wise and prudent, and an excellent general. He was gen- 
erous, too, and courteous by nature; but he had some faults, which 
perhaps belonged as much to the fierce period in which he lived 
as to his own character. He was rash and passionate, and in his 
passion, he was sometimes relentless and cruel. 
Robert the Bruce had fixed his purpose, as I told you, to 
attempt once again to drive the English out of Scotland, and he 
desired to prevail upon Sir John the Red Comyn, who was his 
rival in his pretensions to the throne, to join with him im expelling 
the foreign enemy by their common efforts. With this purpose, 
Bruce posted down from London to Dumfries, on the borders 
of Scotland, and requested an interview with John Comyn. They 
met in the church of the Minorites in that town, before the high 
altar. What passed betwixt them is not known with certainty; 
but they quarreled, either concerning their mutual pretensions 
to the crown, or because Comyn refused to join Bruce in the pro- 
posed insurrection against the English; or, as many writers say, 
because Bruce charged Comyn with having betrayed to the Eng- 
lish his purpose of rising up against King Edward. It is, however, 
certain, that these two haughty barons came to high and abusive 
words, until at length Bruce, who I told you was extremely pas- 
sionate, forgot the sacred character of the place in which they 
stood, and struck Comyn a blow with his dagger. Having done 
this rash deed, he instantly ran out of the church and called for 
his horse. Two gentlemen of the country, Lindesay and Kirk- 
patrick, friends of Bruce, were then in attendance on him. Seeing 
him pale, and in much agitation, they eagerly inquired what was 
the matter. 
“T doubt,” said Bruce, “that I have slain the Red Comyn.” 
“Do you leave such a matter in doubt?” said Kirkpatrick. 
“T will make sicker!”’—that is, I will make certain. 
Accordingly, he and his companion Lindesay rushed into 
the church, and made the matter certain with a vengeance,

  by dispatching the wounded Comyn with their daggers. This 
slaughter of Comyn was a most rash and cruel action; and the 
historian of Bruce observes, that it was followed by the dis- 
pleasure of Heaven; for no man ever went through more mis- 
fortunes than Robert, Bruce, although he at length rose to great 
honor. 
The commencement of Bruce’s undertaking was most disas- 
trous. He was crowned on the twenty-ninth of March, 1306. On 
the nineteenth of June, the new King was completely defeated near 
Methven by the English Earl of Pembroke. Robert’s horse was 
killed under him in the action, and he was for a moment a pris- 
oner. But he had fallen into the power of a Scottish knight, who, 
though he served in the English army, did not choose to be the 
instrument of putting Bruce into their hands, and allowed him ta 
escape. . 
Driven from one place in the Highlands to another, starved out. 
of some districts, and forced from others by the opposition of the 
inhabitants, Bruce attempted to force his way into Lorn; but he 
found enemies everywhere. 
At last dangers increased so much around the brave King 
Robert, that he was obliged to separate himself from his Queen 
and her ladies; for the winter was coming on, and it would be 
impossible for the women to endure this wandering sort of life 
when the frost and snow should set in. So Bruce left his Queen, 
» with the Countess of Buchan and others, in the only castle which 
remained to him, which was called Kildrummie, and is situated 
near the head of the river Don in Aberdeenshire. The King also 
left his youngest brother, Nigel Bruce, to defend the castle against 
the English; and he himself, with his second brother Edward, 
who was a very brave man, but still more rash and passionate 
than Robert himself, went over to an island called Rachrin, on 
the coast of Ireland, where Bruce and the few men who followed 
his fortunes passed the winter of 1306. 
The news of the taking of Kildrummie, the captivity of his 
wife, and the execution of his brother, reached Bruce while he 
was residing in a miserable dwelling at Rachrin, and reduced him 
to the point. of despair.

It was about this time that an incident took place, which, 
although it rests only on tradition in families of the name of 
Bruce, is rendered probable by the manners of the times. After 
receiving the last unpleasing intelligence from Scotland, Bruce 
was lying one morning on his wretched bed, and deliberating with 
himself whether he had not better resign all thoughts of again 
attempting to make good his right to the Scottish crown, and, dis- 
missing his followers, transport himself and his brothers to the 
Holy Land, and spend the rest of his life in fighting against the 
Saracens; by which he thought, perhaps, he might deserve the 
forgiveness of Heaven for the great sin of stabbing Comyn in the 
church at Dumfries. But then, on the other hand, he thought it 
would be both criminal and cowardly to give up his attempts to 
restore freedom to Scotland while there yet remained the least 
chance of his being successful in an undertaking, which, rightly 
considered, was much more his duty than to drive the infidels 
out of Palestine. ” 
While he was divided betwixt these reflections, and doubtful 
of what he should do, Bruce was looking upward to the roof of 
the cabin in which he lay; and his eye was attracted by a spider, 
which, hanging at the end of a long thread of its own spinning, was 
endeavoring, as is the fashion of that creature, to swing itself 
from one beam in the roof to another, for the purpose of fixing the 
line on which it meant to stretch its web. The insect made the 
attempt again and again without success; at length Bruce counted 
that it had tried to carry its point six times, and been as often 
unable to do so. It came into his head that he had himself fought 
just six battles against the English and their allies, and that the 
poor persevering spider was exactly in the same situation with 
himself, having made as many trials and been as often disap- 
pointed in what it aimed at. “Now,” thought Bruce, “as I have 
no means of knowing what is best to be done, I will be guided by 
the luck which shall attend this spider. If the insect shall make 
another effort to fix its thread, and shall be successful, I will ven- 
ture a seventh time to try my fortune in Scotland; but if the spider 
shall fail, I will go to the wars in Palestine, and never return to 
my native country more.”
-P-A-G-E-322

  Robert the Bruce . . ‘ 305 
  While Bruce was forming this resolution the spider made an- 
other exertion with all the force it could muster, and fairly suc- 
ceeded in fastening its thread to the beam which it had so often 
in vain attempted to reach. Bruce, seeing the success of the 
spider, resolved to try his own fortune; and as he had never before 
eained a victory, so he never afterwards sustained any consider- 
able or decisive check or defeat. I have often met with people 
of the name of Bruce, so completely persuaded of the truth of this 
story, that they would not on any account kill a spider, because 
it was that insect which had shown the example of perseverance, 
and given a signal of good luck to their great namesake. 
Having determined to renew his efforts to obtain possession © 
of Seotland, notwithstanding the smallness of the means which 
he had for accomplishing so great a purpose, the Bruce removed 
himself and his.followers from Rachrin to the island of Arran, 
which lies in the mouth of the Clyde. The King landed and in- 
quired of the first woman he met what armed men were in the 
island. She returned for answer that there had arrived there 
very lately a body of armed strangers, who had defeated an Eng- 
lish officer, the governor of the castle of Brathwick, had killed 
him and most of his men, and were now amusing themselves with 
hunting about the island. The King, having caused himself to be 
guided to the woods which these strangers most frequented, there 
blew his horn repeatedly. Now, the chief of the strangers who 
had taken the castle was James Douglas, one of the best of Bruce’s 
friends, and he was accompanied by some of the bravest of that 
patriotic band. When he heard Robert Bruce’s horn, he knew the 
sound well, and cried out that yonder was the King; he knew by 
his manner of blowing. So he and his companions hastened to 
meet King Robert, and there was great joy on both sides; whilst 
at the same time they could not help weeping when they consid- 
ered their own forlorn condition, and the great loss that had 
taken place among their friends since they had last parted. But 
they were stout-hearted men, and looked forward to freeing their 
country in spite of all that had yet happened. 
When King Edward the First heard that Scotland was again 
in arms against him, he marched down to the borders with many

threats of what he would do to avenge himself on Bruce and his 
party, whom he called rebels. 
Other great lords besides Douglas were now exerting them- 
selves to attack and destroy the English. Amongst those was Sir 
Thomas Randolph, whose mother was a sister of King Robert. 
He had joined with the Bruce when he first took up arms. After- ° 
wards being made prisoner by the English, when the King was 
defeated at Methven, Sir Thomas Randolph was obliged to join 
the English to save his life. He remained so constant to them, 
that- he was. in company with Aymer de Valence and John of 
Lorn, when they forced the Bruce to disperse his little band; and 
he followed the pursuit so close, that he made his uncle’s standard- 
bearer prisoner and took his banner. Afterwards, howéver, he 
was himself made prisoner, at a solitary house on Lyne-water, by 
1s the good Lord James Douglas, who brought him captive to the 
King. Robert reproached his nephew for having deserted his 
cause; and Randolph, who was very hot-tempered, answered inso- 
lently, and was sent by King Robert to prison. Shortly after, the 
uncle and nephew were reconciled, and Sir Thomas Randolph, 
created Earl of Murray by the King, was ever afterwards one of 
Bruce’s best supporters. There was a sort of rivalry between 
Douglas and him, which should do the boldest and most hazardous 
actions. I will just mention one or two circumstances, which will 
show you what awful dangers were to be encountered by these 
25 brave men, in order to free Scotland from its enemies and invaders. 
While Robert Bruce was gradually. getting possession of the 
country, and driving out the English, Edinburgh, the principal 
town of Scotland, remained, with its strong castle, in possession 
of the invaders. Sir Thomas Randolph was extremely desirous 
to gain this important place; but, as you well know, the castle is 
situated on a very steep and lofty rock, so that it is difficult or 
almost impossible even to get up to the foot of the walls, much 
more to climb over them. 
So while Randolph was considering what was to be done, there 
35 came to him a Scottish gentleman named Francis, who had joined 
Bruce’s standard, and asked to speak with him in private. He 
then told Randolph, that in his youth he had lived in the Castle a

of Edinburgh, and that his father had then been keeper of the 
fortress. It happened at that time that Francis was much in 
love with a lady, who lived in a part of the town beneath the 
castle, which is called the Grassmarket. Now, as he could not 
of clambering by night down the castle rock on the south side, 
and returning at his pleasure; when he came to the foot of the 
wall, he made use of a ladder to get over it, as it was not very 
high at that point, those who built it having trusted to the steep- 
1 ness of the crag; and, for the same reason, no watch was placed 
there. Francis had gone and come so frequently in this danger- 
ous manner, that, though it was now long ago, he told Randolph 
he knew the road so well that he would undertake to guide a small 
party of men by night to the bottom of the wall; and as they might 
1s bring ladders with them, there would be no difficulty in sealing it. 
The great risk was that of their being discovered by the watch- 
men while in the act of ascending the cliff, in which case every 
man of them must have perished. 
Nevertheless, Randolph did not hesitate to attempt the adven- 
2 ture. He took with him only thirty men (you may be sure they 
were chosen for activity and courage), and came one dark night 
to the foot of the rock, which they began to ascend under the 
guidance of Francis, who went before them, upon his hands and 
feet, up one cliff, down another, and round another, where there 
% was scarce room to support themselves. All the while these 
thirty men were obliged to follow in a line, one after the other, 
by a path that was fitter for a cat than a man. The noise of a 
stone falling, or a word spoken from one to another, would have 
alarmed the watchmen. The, were obliged, therefore, to move 
with the greatest precaution. When they were far up the crag, 
and near the foundation of the wall, they heard the guards going 
their rounds, to see that all was safe in-and about the castle. 
Randolph and his party had nothing for it but to lie close and 
quiet, each man under the crag, as he happened to be placed, and 
3% trust that the guards would pass by without noticing them. And 
while they were waiting in breathless alarm they got a new cause 
of fright. One of the soldiers of the castle, willing to startle his es s

  comrades, suddenly threw a stone from the wall, and cried out, 
“Aha, I see you well!” The stone came thundering down over the 
heads of Randolph and his men, who naturally thought them- 
selves discovered. If they had stirred, or made the slightest noise, 
they would have been entirely destroyed; for the soldiers above 
might have killed every man of them merely by rolling down 
stones. But being courageous and chosen men, they remained 
quiet, and the English soldiers, who thought their comrade was 
merely playing them a trick (as, indeed, he had no other mean- 
ing in what he did and said), passed on without further exam- 
ination. 
Then Randolph and his men got up and came in haste to the 
foot of the wall, which was not above twice a man’s height in that 
place. They planted the ladders they had brought, and Francis 
mounted first to show them the way; Sir Andrew Grey, a brave 
knight, followed him, and Randolph himself was the third man 
who got over. Then the rest followed. When once they were 
within the walls, there was not so much to do, for the garrison 
were asleep and unarmed, excepting the watch, who were speedily 
destroyed. Thus was Edinburgh Castle taken in March, 1312-13. 
It was not, however, only by the exertions of great and power- 
ful barons, like Randolph and Douglas, that the freedom of Scot- 
land was to be accomplished. The stout yeomanry and the bold 
peasantry of the land, who were as desirous to enjoy their cot- 
tages in honorable independence as the nobles were to reclaim 
their castles and estates from the English, contributed their full 
share in the efforts which were made to deliver the country from 
the invaders. I will give you one instance among many. 
There was a strong castle near Linlithgow, or Lithgow, as the 
word is more generally pronounced, where an English governor, 
with a powerful garrison, lay in readiness to support the English 
cause, and used to exercise much severity upon the Scots in the 
neighborhood. There lived at no great distance from this strong- 
hold, a farmer, a bold and stout man, whose name was Binnock, 
or, as it is now pronounced, Binning. This man saw with great 
joy the progress which the Scots were making in recovering their 
country from the English, and resolved to do something to help
-P-A-G-E-326
  Castle of Lithgow. But the place was very strong, situated by 
the side of a lake, defended not only by gates, which were usually 
kept shut against strangers, but also by a portcullis. A portcullis 
s isa sort. of door formed of cross-bars of iron, like a grate. It has 
not hinges like a door, but is drawn up by pulleys, and let down 
when any danger approaches. It may be let go in a moment, and 
then falls down into the doorway; and as it has great iron spikes 
at the bottom, it crushes all that it lights upon; thus in case of a 
to sudden alarm, a portcullis may be let suddenly fall to defend the 
entrance, when it is not possible to shut the gates. Binnock knew 
this very well, but he resolved to be provided against this risk 
also when he attempted to surprise the castle. So he spoke with 
some bold, courageous countrymen, and engaged them in his enter- 
3 prise, which he accomplished thus: 
Binnock had been accustomed to supply the garrison of Lin- 
lithgow with hay, and he had been ordered by the English gov- 
ernor to furnish some cart-loads, of which they were in want. He 
promised to bring it accordingly ; but the night before he drove the 
hay to the castle, he stationed a party of his friends, as well armed 
as possible, near the entrance, where they could not be seen by the 
garrison, and gave them directions that they should come to his 
assistance as soon as they should hear him cry a signal, which 
was to be, “Call all, call all!” Then he loaded a great wagon with 
hay. But in the wagon he placed eight strong men, well armed, 
lying flat on their breasts, and covered over with hay, so that they 
could not be seen. He himself walked carelessly beside the wagon; 
and he chose the stoutest and bravest of his servants to be the 
driver, who carried at his belt a strong ax or hatchet. In this way 
» Binnock approached the castle early in the morning; and the 
watchman, who only saw two men, Binnock being one of them, 
with a cart of hay, which they expected, opened the gates and 
raised up the portcullis, to permit them to enter the castle. But 
as soon as the cart had gotten under the gateway, Binnock made 
% a sign to his servant, who with his ax suddenly cut asunder the 
soam, that is, the yoke which fastens the horses to the cart, and 
the horses finding themselves free, naturally started forward, the Robert the Bruce 309 
his countrymen, by getting possession, if it were possible, of the

  cart remaining behind. At the same moment, Binnock cried, as 
loud as he could, “Call all, call all!” and drawing the sword, which 
he had under his country habit, he killed the porter. The armed 
men then jumped up from under the hay where they lay con- 
cealed, and rushed on the English guard. The Englishmen tried 
to shut the gates, but they could not, because the cart of hay 
remained in the gateway, and prevented the folding-doors from 
being closed. The portcullis was also let fall, but the grating was 
caught on the cart, and so could not drop to the ground. The 
men who were in ambush near the gate, hearing the cry, “Call all, 
call all,” ran to assist those who had leaped out from amongst 
the hay; the castle was taken, and all the Englishmen killed or 
made prisoners. King Robert rewarded Binnock by bestowing 
on him an estate, which his posterity long afterwards enjoyed. 
The English now possessed scarcely any place of importance 
in Scotland, excepting Stirling, which was besieged, or rather 
blockaded, by Edward Bruce, the King’s brother. To blockade a 
town or castle is to quarter an army around it, so as to prevent 
those within from getting provisions. This was done by the Scots 
before Stirling, till Sir Philip Mowbray, who commanded the 
castle, finding that he was like to be reduced to extremity for want 
of provisions, made an agreement with Edward Bruce that he 
would surrender the place, provided he were not relieved by the 
King of England before midsummer. Sir Edward agreed to these 
terms, and allowed Mowbray to go to London, to tell King Edward 
of the conditions he had made. But when King Robert heard what 
his brother had done, he thought it was too great a risl: 
obliged him to venture a battle with the full strength oi 
the Second, who had under him England, Ireland, Wales, 
part of France, and could within the time allowed as 
much more powerful army than the Scots could, even if 
land were fully under the King’s authority. Sir Edward

When Sir Philip Mowbray, the governor of Stirling, came to 
London, to tell the King that Stirling, the last Scottish town of 
importance which remained in possession of the English, was to be 
surrendered if it were not relieved by force of arms before mid- 
summer, then all the English nobles called out, it would be a sin . 
and shame to permit the fair conquest which Edward the First 
had made, to be forfeited to the Scots for want of fighting. 
King Edward the Second, therefore, assembled one of the 
greatest armies which a King of England ever commanded. There

plain near Stirling, called the Park, near which, an’ ' 
the English army must needs pass through a bo; 
broken with water-courses, while the Scots occupi 
ground. He then caused all the ground upon the fro 
of battle, where cavalry were likely to act, to be dug 
about as deep as a man’s knee. They were filled with 
wood, and the turf was laid on the top, so that it app: 
field, while in reality it was all full of these pits as : 
is of holes. He also, it is said, caused steel spikes, call 
to be scattered up and down in the plain, where the 
alry were most likely to advance, trusting in that ma 
and destroy their horses.

  troops could attack them there. On the left, the Scottish line 
extended near to the town of Stirling. Bruce reviewed his troops 
very carefully; all the useless servants, drivers of carts, and such 
like, of whom there were very many, he ordered to go behind a | 
s height, afterwards, in memory of the event, called the Gillies’ 
hill, that is, the Servants’ hill. He then spoke to the soldiers, and 
expressed his determination to gain the victory, or to lose his life 
on the field of battle. He desired that all those who did not pro- 
pose to fight to the last should leave the field before the battle 
o began, and that none should remain except those who were deter- 
mined to take the issue of victory or death, as God should send it. 
When the main body of his army was thus placed in order, the 
King posted Randolph, with a body of horse, near to the Church 
of St. Ninian’s, commanding him to use the utmost diligence to 
i prevent any succors from being thrown into Stirling Castle. He 
then dispatched James of Douglas, and Sir Robert Keith, the 
Mareschal of the Scottish army, in order that they might survey, 
as nearly as they could, the English force, which was now ap- 
- proaching from Falkirk. They returned with information, that 
2 the approach of that vast host was one of the most beautiful and 
terrible sights which could be seen—that the whole country 
seemed covered with men-at-arms on horse and foot—that the 
member of standards, banners, and pennons made so gallant a 
show, that the bravest and most numerous host in Christendom 
s might be alarmed to see King KXdward moving against them. 
It was pon the twenty-third of June (1314) the King of 
Scotland heard the news, that the English army were approaching 
| Stirling. He drew out his army, therefore, in the order which he 
had before resolved on. After a short time, Bruce, who was look- 
0 ing out anxiously for the enemy, saw a body of English cavalry 
trying to get into Stirling from the eastward. This was the Lord 
Clifford, who, with a chosen body of eight hundred horse, had 
| been detached to relieve the castle. 
“See, Randolph,” said the King to his nephew, “there is a rose 
3 fallen from your chaplet.” By this he meant that Randolph had 
lost some honor, by suffering the enemy to pass where he had been 
stationed to hinder them. Randolph made no reply. but rushed | The Battle of Bannockburn ; 313

were on foot. The English turned to charge them ° 
lances, and Randolph drew up his men in close order

“Let Randolph,” he said, “redeem his own *

not let us lessen his glory by approaching the field.” Now, ~ 
was nobly done; especially as Douglas and Randolph were: 
20 ways contending which should rise highest in the good opinion vu: 
the King of the nation. 
The van of the English army now came in sight, and a num- 
ber of their bravest knights drew near to see what the Scots were 
doing. They saw King Robert dressed in his armor and distin- 
25 guished by a gold crown, which he wore over his helmet. He was 
not mounted on his great war-horse, because he did not expect to 
fight that evening. But he rode on a little pony up and down 
the ranks of his army, putting his men in order, and carried in his 
hand a sort of battle-ax made of steel. 
30 The next morning, being the twenty-fourth of June, at break 
of day, the battle began in terrible earnest. The English as they 
advanced saw the Scots getting into line. The Abbot of Inchaf- 
fray walked through their ranks bare-footed, and exhorted them 
to fight for their freedom. They knecled down as he passed, and 
36 prayed to Heaven for victory. King Edward, who saw this, called 
out, “They kneel down—they are asking forgiveness.” “Yes,” 
said a celebrated English baron, called Ingelram de Umphraville,
-P-A-G-E-332
a 
The Battle of Bannockburn ~ 315   
  “but they ask it from God, not from us—these men will conquer, 
or die upon the field.” 
The English King ordered his men to begin the battle. The 
archers then bent their bows, and began to shoot so closely to- 
gether, that the arrows fell like flakes of snow on a Christmas 
day. They killed many of the Scots, and might, as at Falkirk, 
and other places, have decided the victory; but Bruce, as I told 
you before, was prepared for them. He had in readiness a body 
of men-at-arms, well mounted, who rode at full gallop among the — 
archers, and as they had no weapons save their bows and arrows, 
which they could not use when they were attacked hand to hand, 
they were cut down in great numbers by the Scottish horsemen, 
and thrown into total confusion. 
The fine English cavalry then advanced to support their arch- 
ers, and to attack the Scottish line. But coming over the ground 
which was dug full of pits, the horses fell into these holes, and 
the riders lay tumbling about, without any means of defense, 
and unable to rise, from the weight of their armor. The English- 
men began to fall into general disorder; and the Scottish King, 
bringing up more of his forces, attacked and pressed them still 
more closely. 
On a sudden, while the battle was obstinately maintained on 
both sides, an event happened which decided the victory. The 
servants and attendants on the Scottish camp had; as I told you, 
been sent. behind the army to a place afterwards called the Gillies’ 
hill. But when they saw that their masters were likely to gain 
the day, they rushed from their place of concealment with such 
weapons as they could get, that they might have their share in the 
victory and in the spoil. The English, seeing them come suddenly 
over the hill, mistook this disorderly rabble for a new army com- 
ing up to sustain the Scots, and, losing all heart, began to shift 
every man for himself. Edward himself left the field as fast as he 
could ride. A valiant knight, Sir Giles de Argentine, much re- 
nowned in the wars of Palestine, attended the King till he got him 
6 out of the press of the combat. But he would retreat no farther. 
“It is not my custom,” he said, “to fly.” With that he took leave 
of the King, set, spurs to his horse, and calling out his war-cry of eG@Gerv—X—Xesolo So ~ sooo

(1315-1330) 
Robert Bruce continued to reign gloriously for severe. 
and was so constantly victorious over the English, that t! 
seemed during his government to have acquired a complet 
riority over their neighbors. But then we must remem! 
s Edward the Second, who then reigned in England, was a :vousr: 
prince, and listened to bad counsels; so that it is no wor * 
he was beaten by so wise and experienced a general a 
Bruce, who had fought his way to the crown through ov wauy 
disasters, and acquired in consequence so much renown, that, as 
10 I have often said, he was generally accounted one of the best sol- 
diers and wisest sovereigns of his time. 
In the last year of Robert the Bruce’s reign, he be: 
tremely sickly and infirm, chiefly owing to a disorder c: 
leprosy, which he had caught during the hardships anc 
1s tunes of his youth, when he was so frequently obliged to hue uuu- 
self in woods and morasses, without a roof to shelter him. While 
Bruce was in this feeble state, Edward the Second, King of Eng- 
land, died, and was succeeded by his son Edward the Thi’ 
turned out afterwards to be one of the wisest and braves! 
2 whom England ever had; but when he first mounted the ssn 
he was very young, and under the entire management of his 
mother. 
The war between the English and the Scots still lasting at 
time, Bruce sent his two great commanders, the good Lord Jaiues 
2 Douglas, and Thomas Randolph, Earl of Murray, to lay waste the 
counties of Northumberland and Durham, and distress the English 
as much as they could. 
Their soldiers were about twenty thousand in number, all 
lightly armed, and mounted on horses that were quite small in 
height, but excessively active. The men themselves carried no 
provision, except a bag of oatmeal; and each had at his saddle 
a small plate of iron called a girdle, on which, when they pleased, 
they could bake the oatmeal into cakes. They killed the cattle 
of the English, as they traveled through the country, roasted the

flesh on wooden spits, or boiled it in the skins of the animals them- 
selves, putting in a little water with the beef, to prevent the fire 
‘mn burning the hide to pieces. This was rough cookery. They 
de their shoes, or rather sandals, in as coarse a way; cutting 
5 m out of the raw hides of the cattle, and fitting them to their 
Wles, like what are now called short gaiters. As this sort of 
kin had the hairy side of the hide outermost, the English called 
| bh, who wore them rough-footed Scots, and sometimes, from A 
thdigolor of the hide, red-shanks. 
As such forces needed to carry nothing with them, either for 
provisions or ammunition, the Scots moved with amazing speed, 
from mountain to mountain, and from glen to glen, pillaging and 
destroying the country wheresoever they came. In the meanwhile, 
the King of England pursued them with a much larger army; but, 
as it was encumbered by the necessity of carrying provisions in 
great quantities, and by the slow motions of men in heavy armor, 
they could not come up with the Scots, although they saw every 
day the smoke of the houses and villages which they were burning. 
The King of England was extremely angry; for, though only a 
boy sixteen years old, he longed to fight the Scots and to chastise 
them for the mischief they were doing to his country; and at 
length he grew so impatient that he offered a large reward to any 
one who would show him where the Scottish army were. : 
At length, after the English host had suffered severe hardships, 
irom want of provisions, and fatiguing journeys through fords, 
and swamps, and morasses, a gentleman named Rokeby came into 
the camp and claimed the reward which the King had offered. 
He told the King that he had been made prisoner by the Scots, 
and that they said they should be as glad to meet the English 
King as he to see them. Accordingly, Rokeby guided the English 
army to the place where the Scots lay encamped. 
But the English King was no nearer to the battle which he 
desired; for Douglas and Randolph, knowing the force and num- 
bers of the English army, had taken up their camp on a steep hill, 
at the bottom of which ran a deep river called the Wear, having 
a channel filled with large stones, so that there was no poscibility 
for the English to attack the Scots without crossing the water, and

a risk which was too great to be attempted. 
Then the King sent a message of defiance to the Scottish ¢ 
erals, inviting them either to draw back their forces, and aurs,

“Ah,” said the Earl, “had we gone all together to the night attack,

| After this a peace was concluded with Robert Bruce, on terms 
highly honorable to Scotland; for the English King renounced all 
pretensions to the sovereignty of the country, and, moreover, gave 
his sister, a princess called Joanna, to be wife to Robert Bruce’s 
son, called David. This treaty was very advaritageous to the 
Scots. It was called the treaty of Northampton, because it was 
concluded at that town, in the year 1328. 
Good King Robert did not long survive this joyful event. He 
was not aged more than four-and-fifty years, but, as I said before, 
we his bad health was caused by the hardships which he sustained 
during his youth, and at length he became very ill. Finding that 
he could not recover, he assembled around his bedside the nobles 
and counselors in whom he most trusted. He told them that 
now, being on his death-bed, he sorely repented all his misdeeds, 
3 and particularly, that he had, in his passion, killed Comyn with 
his own hand, in the church and before the altar. He said’that 
if he had lived, he had intended to go to Jerusalem, to make war 
upon the Saracens who held the Holy Land, as some expiation 
for the evil deeds he had done. The King soon afterwards ex- 
pired and his body was laid in the sepulcher in the midst of the 
church of Dunfermline, under a marble stone. But the church 
becoming afterwards ruinous, and the roof falling down with age, 
the monument was broken to pieces, and nobody could tell where 
it stood. But six or seven years ago, when they were repairing 
the church at Dunfermline, and removing the rubbish, lo! they 
found fragments of the marble tomb of Robert Bruce. Then they 
began to dig farther, thinking to discover the body of this cele- 
brated monarch; and at length they came to the skeleton of a tall 
man, and they knew it must be that of King Robert, as he was 
known to have been buried in a winding sheet of cloth of gold, 
of which many fragments were found about this skeleton. So . 
orders were sent from the King’s Court of Exchequer to guard 
the bones carefully, until a new tomb should be prepared, into 
which they were laid with profound respect. A great many gen- 
tlemen and ladies attended, and almost all the common people 
in the neighborhood; and as the church could not hold half the 
numbers, the people were allowed to pass through it, one after 3 —

THE PARTING OF MARMION AND DOUGLAS 
SIR WALTER SCOTT 
Not far advanced was morning day, 
When Marmion did his troop array, 
To Surrey’s camp to ride; 
He had safe conduct for his band, 
Beneath the royal seal and hand, 
And. Douglas gave a guide. 
The train from out the castle drew, 
But Marmion stopped to bid adieu: 
“Though something I might ’plain,” he said, 
“Of cold respect to stranger guest, 
Sent hither by your King’s behest, 
While in Tantallon’s towers I stayed, 
Part we in friendship from your land, 
And, noble Earl, receive my hand.” 
But Douglas round him drew his cloak, 
Folded his arms, and thus he spoke: 
“My manors, halls, and bowers shall still a 
Be open, at my Sovereign’s will, : 
To each one whom he lists, howe’er 
Unmeet to be the owner’s peer. 
My castles are my King’s alone, 
From turret to foundation stone; 
The hand of Douglas is his own, 
And never shall, in friendly grasp,

To cleave the Douglas’ head!

Although the meanest in her state, . 
May well, proud Angus, be thy mate: 
And, Douglas, more, I tell thee here, 
Even in thy pitch of pride— 
Here, in thy hold, thy vassals near, 
I tell thee, thou’rt defied! 
And if thou said’st I am not peer 
To any lord in Scotland here, 
Lowland or Highland, far or near, 
Lord Angus, thou hast lied!” 
On the Earl’s cheek, the flush of rage 
O’ercame the ashen hue of age; 
Fierce he broke forth: “And dar’st thou then 
To beard the lion in his den, 
The Douglas in his hall? 
And hop’st thou hence unscathed to go? 
No, by Saint Bride of Bothwell, no! 
Up drawbridge, grooms—what, warder, ho! 
Let the portcullis fall.” 
Lord Marmion turned—well was his need, 
And dashed the rowels in his steed; 
Like arrow through the archway sprung; 
The ponderous grate behind him rung— 
To pass there was such scanty room, 
The bars, descending, razed his plume. 
The steed along the drawbridge flies, 
Just as it trembled on the rise; 
Nor lighter does the swallow skim 
Along the smooth lake’s level brim;

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Note. Marmion, an English nobleman, has been sent as an envoy 
by Henry the Eighth, King of England, to James the Fourth, King of Scot- 
land. The two countries are on the eve of war with each other. Arriving 
in Edinburgh, Marmion is entrusted by King James to the care and hos- 
pitality of Douglas, Earl of Argus, who, taking him to his castle at Tan- 
tallon, treats him with the respect due his position as representative of the 
King, but at the same time dislikes him. The war approaching, Marmion 
leaves to join the English camp. This sketch describes the leave-taking.

Historical Note. Burns wrote this ode to fit an old ait, said in Scottish 
tradition to have been Robert Bruce’s march at the battle of Bannockburn. 
“This thought,” he says, “in my solitary wanderings, has warmed me to a 
pitch of enthusiasm on the theme of liberty and independence.” The story 
is told that Burns wrote this pcem while riding on horseback over a wild 
moor in Scotland in company with a Mr. Syme, who, observing the expres- 
sion on the poet’s face, refrained from speaking to- him. Doubtless this 
vigorous hymn was singing itself through the soul of Burns.as he wrote it. 
The poem is considered the most stirring war ode ever written. 
Discussion. 1. Who is supposed to speak the words? 2. To whom are 
they supposed to be addressed? 3, For what did Bruce contend? 4. What 
patriot before him had fought against great odds in the same cause? 5. In 
these lines, what choice does Bruce offer his army? 6. To what deep feeling 
does he appeal? 7. Does this poem represent truly Bruce’s own feeling for 
his country,.as history acquaints us with it? 8. Which are'the most stirring 
lines? 9, What was Burns’s purpose in writing it? 10. What influence does 
such a poem have?

Crane, by Duffield; the Foresight and the Crane being but small 
ships only—the others were of middle size. The rest, besides the 
bark Raleigh, commanded by Captain Thin, were victuallers, and 
of small force or none. ° : 
The Spanish fleet, having shrouded their approach by: reason 
of the island, were now so soon at hand as our ships had scarce 
time to weigh their anchors, but some of them were driven to let. 
slip their cables and set sail. Sir Richard Grenville was the last 
weighed, to recover the men that were upon the island, which 
otherwise had been lost. The Lord Thomas with the rest very 
hardly recovered the wind, which Sir Richard Grenville not being 
able to do, was persuaded by the master and others to cut his 
mainsail and cast about, and to trust to the sailing of his ship. 
But Sir Richard utterly refused to turn from the enemy, alleging 
that he would rather choose to die than to dishonor himself, his 
country, and her Majesty’s ship, persuading his company that he 
would pass through the two squadrons in despite of them and 
enforce those of Seville to give him way. Which he performed 
upon divers of the foremost, who, as the mariners term it, fell 
- under the lee of the Revenge. 
In the meanwhile, as he attended those which were nearest him, 
the great San Philip, being in the wind of him, and coming toward 
him, becalmed his sails—so huge was the Spanish ship, being of a 
thousand and five hundred tons; who afterlaid the Revenge 
8 aboard. When he was thus bereft of his sails, the ships that were Foose under his lee also laid him aboard; of which the next was the 
admiral of the Biscayans, a very mighty and puissant ship com- 
manded by Brittan Dona. The said Philip carried three tier of 
ordnance on a side and cleven pieces in every tier. 
After the Revenge was entangled with this Philip, four others 
boarded her, two on her larboard and two on her starboard. The 
fight thus beginning at three of the clock in the afternoon con- 
tinued very terrible all that evening. But the great San Philip, 
having received the lower tier of the Revenge, shifted herself with 
all diligence from her sides, utterly misliking her first. entertain- 
ment. Some say that the ship foundered, but we cannot report 
it for truth waless we were assured.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Biographical and Historical Note. In the autumn of 1591 a small fleet 
of English vessels Jay at the Azores to intercept the Spanish treasure ships 
from the Indies. On the appearance of the Spanish war-vessels sent to 
convoy the treasure ships, the much smaller English fleet took flight with the 
exception of the Revenge, commanded by Sir Richard Grenville. Lord 
Bacon described the fight as “a defeat exceeding victory.” 
This story of the fight of the Revenge was written by Sir Walter Raleigh 
(1552-1618), a cousin of Grenville’s. He was an English explorer, colonizer, 
and historian. He planted the first English colony in America, on Roa- 
noke Island, off the coast of North Carolina. Later, he was interested in 
ap attempt to form a colony in Guiana, and his account of his experiences 
is one of the most thrilling adventure stories in the world. His daring 
exploits made him a favorite at the court of Queen Elizabeth, but after 
her death he gained the ill-will of James I and was executed on a false 
charge of piracy and treason.

ENGLAND AND AMERICA NATURAL ALLIES 
JOHN RICHARD GREEN 
Whatever might be the importance of American independence 
in the history of England, it was of unequaled moment in the 
history of the world. If it crippled for a while the supremacy 
of the English nation, it founded the supremacy of the English 
race. From the hour of American Independence the life of the 
English people has flowed not in one current, but in two; and 
while the older has shown little signs of lessening, the younger 
has fast risen to a greatness which has changed the face of the 
world. In 1783 America was a nation of three millions of inhab- 
itants, scattered thinly along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. It 
is now [1877] a nation of forty millions, stretching over the whole 
continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific. In wealth and mate- 
rial energy, as in numbers, it far surpasses the mother-country 
from which it sprang. It is already the main branch of the Eng- 
lish people; and in the days that are at hand the main current of 
that people’s history must run along the channel not of the 
Thames or the Mersey, but of the Hudson and the Mississippi. 
But distinct as these currents are, every year proves more 
clearly that in spirit the English people are one. The distance 
that parted England from America lessens every day. The ties 
that unite them grow every day stronger. The social and polit- 
ical differences that threatened a hundred years ago to form an 
impassable barrier between them grow every day less. Against 
this silent and inevitable drift of things the spirit of narrow iso- 
lation on either side the Atlantic struggles in vain. It is possible 
that the two branches of the English people will remain forever 
separate political existences. It is likely enough that the older 
of them may again break in twain, -and that the English people 
in the Pacific may assert as distinct a national life as the two 
English peoples on either side the Atlantic. But the spirit, the 
influence, of all these branches will remain one. : 
_ And in thus remaining one, before half a century is over it

  will change the face of the world. As two hundred millions of 
Englishmen fill the valley of the Mississippi, as fifty millions of 
Englishmen assert their lordship over Australasia, this vast power 
will tell through Britain on the old world of Europe, whose nations 
will have shrunk into insignificance before it. What the issues 
of such a world-wide change may be, not even the wildest dreamer 
would dare to dream. But one issue is inevitable, In the cen- 
turies that lie before us, the primacy of the world will lie with the 
English people. English institutions, English speech, English 
thought, will become the main features of the political, the social, 
and the intellectual life of mankind.

eloquent preacher, but an effective worker among his parishioners. Ill 
health caused him to resign and devote his time entirely to writing. He 
was a noted English historian, the author of A History of the English 
People and The Making of England. His vivid imagination enabled him to 
picture the life of the people and to make history interesting and popular.

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Biography. Thomas Hardy (1840- ——) was born in Dorsetshire, 
England. He was educated at local schools and by private tutors. At the 
early age of sixteen he was apprenticed to an architect of Worcester, in 
which line of work he made sufficient success to win a prize for design 
from the Architectural Association. At the same.time he was writing some 
verse and an occasional short story, and was at a loss to know which kind 
of work to follow for a profession. However, after 1870 he spent most 
of his time in writing. He excels as a short story writer, his “The Three 
Strangers” appearing in a number of lists of the one hundred best short 
stories. Among his other works, Laughing Stock and Other Verses, Under 
the Grenwood Tree, and A Pair of Blue Eyes are widely known. Mr. 
Hardy was given the Order of Merit in 1910. The Poem “Men Who March 
Away,” from Selected Poems of Thomas Hardy, was written at the time 
the, English soldiers were entering the World War. 
Discussion. 1. What “faith and fire’ must the soldier have who freely 
enlists in the service of his country in war? 2. Whom does the poet address 
in the second stanza? 3. Use other words instead of “purblind prank.” 
4. Explain the- meaning of the fourth and fifth lines of the third stanza. 
5. Why does the poet say the soldiers march away to war ungrieving? 
6. What reason is given for the “faith and fire” of the soldiers? 7. In the 
fourth stanza, with what belief does the author accredit us? 8. What effect 
does the poet create by repeating the first stanza in closing the poem?

GRANDFATHER’S CHAIR 
, NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE 
How New Encianp Was Governep 
The children had now learned to look upon the chair with an 
interest which was almost’ the same as if it were a conscious 
being and could remember the many famous pedple whom it had 
held within its arms. 
Even Charley, lawless as he was, seemed to feel that this 
yenerable chair must not be clambered upon or overturned, 
although he had no scruple in taking such liberties with every 
other chair in the house. Clara treated it with still greater rev- 
erence, often taking occasion to.smooth its cushion and to brush 
10 the dust from the carved flowers and grotesque figures of its oaken 
ack and arms. Laurence would sometimes sit a whole hour, espe- 
ially at twilight, gazing at the chair and by the spell of his imag- 
nation summoning up its ancient occupants to appear in it again. 
Little Alice evidently employed herself in a similar way, for 
nee, when Grandfather had gone abroad, the child was heard 
alking with the gentle Lady Arbella as if she were still sitting in 
he chair. So sweet a child as little Alice may fitly talk with 
ngels such as Lady Arbella had long since become.

Grandfather was soon importuned for more stories about the 
chair. He had no difficulty in relating them, for it really seemed 
as if every person noted in our early history had on some occa- 
sion or other found repose within its comfortable arms. If Grand- 
father took pride in anything, it was in being the possessor of 
such an honorable and historic elbow-chair. 
“TI know not precisely who next got possession of the chair 
after Governor Vane went back to England,” said Grandfather, 
“but there is reason to believe that President Dunster sat in it 
when he held the first commencement at Harvard College. You 
have often heard, children, how careful our forefathers were to 
give their young people a good education. They had scarcely cut 
down trees enough to make room for their own dwellings before 
they began to think of establishing a college. Their principal 
object was to rear up pious and learned ministers, and hence old 
writers call Harvard College a school of the prophets.” 
_ “Ts the college a school of the prophets now?” asked Charley. 
“Tt is a long while since I took my degree, Charley. . You must, 
ask some of the recent graduates,” answered Grandfather. “As 
I was telling you, President Dunster’ sat in Grandfather’s chair 
in 1642 when he conferred the degree of bachelor of arts on nine 
young men, They were the first in America who had received 
that honor. An@ now, my dear auditors, I must confess that 
there are contradictory statements and some uncertainty about 
the adventures of the chair for a period of almost ten years. 
Some say that it was occupied by your own ancestor, William 
Hawthorne, first Speaker of the House of Representatives. I 
have nearly satisfied myself, however, that during most of this 
questionable period it was literally the chair of state. It gives 
me much pleasure to imagine that several successive governors 
of Massachusetts sat in it at the council board.” 
' “But, Grandfather,” interposed Charley, who was a matter- 
of-fact little person, “what reason have you to imagine so?” 
“Pray do imagine it, Grandfather,” said Laurence. 
“With Charley’s permission I will,” replied Grandfather, 
smiling. “Let us consider it settled, therefore, that’ Winthrop, 
Bellingham, Dudley, and Endicott, each of them; when chosen

governor, took his seat in our great chair on Election day. In 
this chair, likewise, did those excellent governors preside while 
holding consultation with the chief councilors of the province, 
who were styled assistants. The governor sat in this chair, too, 
whenever messages were brought to him from the chamber of 
Representatives.” . 
And here Grandfather took occasion to talk rather tediously 
about the nature and forms of government that established them- 
selves almost spontaneously in Massachusetts and the other New 
England colonies. Democracies were the natural growth of the 
new world. As to Massachusetts, it was at first intended that 
the colony should be governed by a council in London. But in a 
little while the people had the whole power in their own hands, 
and chose annually the governor, the councilors, and the repre- 
sentatives. The people of Old England had never enjoyed any- 
thing like the liberties and privileges which the settlers‘of New 
England now possessed. And they did not adopt these modes of 
government after long study, but in simplicity, as if there were 
no other way for peopie to be ruled. 
“But, Laurence,” continued Grandfather, “when you want 
instruction on these points you must seek it in Mr. Bancroft’s 
History. I am merely telling the history of a chair. To pro- 
ceed. The period during which the governors sat in our chair 
was not very full of striking incidents. The province was now 
established on a secure foundation, but it did not increase so 
rapidly as at first, because the Puritans were no longer driven 
from England by persecution. However, there was still a quiet 
and naturai growth. The legislature incorporated towns and 
made new purchases of lands from the Indians. A very mem- 
orable event took place in 1643. The colonies of Massachusetts, 
Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven formed a union for the 
purpose of assisting each other in difficulties, for mutual defense 
against their enemies. They called themselves the United Col- 
onies of New England.” 
“Were they under a government like that of the United 
States?” inquired Laurence. 
“No,” replied Grandfather; “the different colonies did not
-P-A-G-E-365
  348 Junior High School Literature, Book On: 
  compose one nation together; it was merely a confederacy among 
the governments. It somewhat resembled the league of the Am- 
phictyons, which you remember in Grecian history. But to return 
to our chair. In 1644 it was highly honored, for Governor Endi- 
> cott sat in it when he gave audience to an ambassador from the 
French governor of Acadia, or Nova Scotia. A treaty of peace 
between Massachusetts and the French colony was then signed.” 
“Did England allow Massachusetts to make war and peace 
with foreign countries?” asked Laurence. 
10 6 “Massachusetts and the whole of New England were then 
almost independent of the mother country,” said Grandfather. 
“There was now a civil war in England, and the King, as you may 
well suppose, had his hands full at home, and could pay but little 
attention to these remote colonies. When the Parliament got 
is the power into their hands they likewise had enough t~ ?- :- 
keeping down the Cavaliers. Thus New England, like , 
and hardy lad whose father and mother neglect it, wa 
take care of itself. In 1646, King Charles was beheaded. Guver 
Cromwell then became Protector of England, and, as he was a 
zo Puritan himself and had risen by the valor of the English Puri- 
tans, he showed himself a loving and indulgent father to the 
Puritan colonies in America.” 
Grandfather might have continued to talk in this dull manner 
nobody knows how long, but, suspecting that Charle: a 
zs the subject rather dry, he looked sidewise at that vis 
fellow and saw him give an involuntary yawn. 
Grandfather proceeded with the history of the chair, uuu wiace 
a very entertaining incident which will be found in the next 
chapter. 
NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Biography. Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804-1864) was a master of the 
short story as a means for interpreting character. His ancestors were men 
of action--soldiers, seamen, and public officials. But he was unlike them: 
all his life he was a dreamer who loved solitude better than society. The 
subject of his dreaming was human character, particulaily the 
of the Puritan founders of New England. He told many legends o 
times, some of them portraying the stern methods of Governor 11... :

  or telling a humorous story of the Pine-Tree Shillings, or recounting the 
weird story of the old gray champion who defied Goveraor Andros, But 
besides these legends he wrote stories, visions of life in which one can 
scarcely draw the line between reality and illusion; stories of lovers who 
sought vainly for happiness; stories of a great stone face on the moun- 
tain side, and what it signified. Somewhat longer than these tales—Twice 
Told Tales he called them—are his romances, such as The Scarlet Letter, 
and The House of the Seven Gables. Besides his longer romances 
he popularized New England history in the form of stories for children. 
From one such book, Grandfather's Chair, these stories have been taken.

Tur Pine-Tree SHILLINGS 
“According to the most authentic records, my dear children,” 
said Grandfather, “the chair about this time had the misfortune 
to break its leg. It was probably on account of this accident that 
it ceased to be the seat of the governors of Massachusetts, for, 
assuredly, it would have been ominous of ‘evil to the common- 
wealth if the chair of state had tottered upon three legs. Being 
therefore sold at auction—alas! what a vicissitude for a chair 
that had figured in such high company!—our venerable friend 
was knocked down to a certain Captain John Hull. This old

serviceable as ever.” 
“Here is the very leg that was broken!” exclaime: 
throwing himself down on the floor to look at it. “An 
the iron clamps. How well it was mended!” 
When they had all sufficiently examined the broken le; 
father told them a story about Captain John Hull and tow . wu. 
tree Shillings. 
The Captain John Hull aforesaid was the mint-master 
Massachusetts, and coined all the money that was made thv.-. 
This was a new line of business, for in the earlier days of ** 
colony the current coinage consisted of gold and silver mon: 
England, Portugal, and Spain. These coins being scarce, 
people were often forced to barter their commodities insteau vx 
selling them. . 
For instance: if a man wanted to buy a coat b> ---hew~ --

not money enough of any kind, in many parts of the country, 
to pay the salaries of the ministers, so that they sometimes had 
to take quintals of fish, bushels of corn, or cords of wood instead 
of silver or gold. 
As the people grew more numerous and their trade one with 
another increased, the want of current money was still more 
sensibly felt. To supply the demand the general court passed a 
law for establishing a coinage of shillings, sixpences, and three- 
pences. Captain John Hull was appointed to manufacture this 
money, and was to have about one shilling out of every twenty 
to pay him for the trouble of making them. 
Hereupon all the old silver in the colony was handed over to 
Captain John Hull. The battered silver cans and tankards, I 
suppose, and silver buckles, and broken spoons, and silver buttons

of worn-out coats, and silver hilts of swords that had figured at 
court—all such curious old articles were doubtless thrown into 
the melting-pot together. But by far the greater part of the silver 
consisted of bullion from the mines of South America, which the 
English buccaneers—who were little better than pirates—had 
taken from the Spaniards and brought to Massachusetts. - 
All this old and new silver being melted down and coined, the 
result was an-immense amount of splendid shillings, sixpences, 
and threepences. Each had the date 1652 on the one side and 
the figure of a pine tree on the other. Hence they were called 
pine-tree shillings. And for every twenty shillings that he coined, 
you will remember, Captain John Hull was entitled to put one 
shilling into his own pocket. 
The magistrates soon began to suspect that the mint-master 
would have the best of the bargain. They offered him a large 
sum of money if he would but give up that twentieth shilling 
which he was continually dropping into his. own pocket. But 
Captain Hull declared himself perfectly satisfied with the shilling 
And well he might be, for so diligently did he labor that in a few 
years his pockets, his money-bags, and his strong box were over- 
flowing with pine-tree shillings. This was probably the case 
when he came into possession of Grandfather’s chair; and, as he 
had worked so hard at the mint, it was certainly proper that he 
should have a comfortable chair to rest himself in. . 
‘When the mint-master had grown very rich, a young man, 
Samuel Sewell by name, came a-courting to his only daughter. 
His daughter—whose name I do not know, but we will call her 
Betsey—was a fine, hearty damsel, by no means so slender as 
some young ladies of our own days. On the contrary, having 
always fed heartily on pumpkin pies, doughnuts, Indian puddings, 
and other Puritan dainties, she.was as round and plump as a pud- 
ding herself. With this round, rosy Miss Betsey did Samuel 
Sewell fall in love. As he was a young man of good character, 
industrious in his business, and a member of the church, the mint- 
master very readily gave his consent. 
“Yes, you may take her,” said he, in his rough way, “and you'll 
find her a heavy burden enough.”

On the wedding-day we may suppose that honest John Hull 
dressed himself in a plum-colored coat, all the buttons of which 
were made of pine-tree shillings. The buttons of his waistcoat 
were sixpences, and the knees of his small clothes were buttoned 
with silver threepences. Thus attired, he sat with great dignity 
in Grandfather’s chair, and, being a portly old gentleman, he 
completely filled it from elbow to elbow. On the opposite side of 
the room, between her bridesmaids, sat Miss Betsey. She was 
blushing with all her might, and looked like a full-blown peony 
or a great red apple. 
There, too, was the bridegroom, dressed in a fine purple coat 
and gold-lace waistcoat, with as much other finery as the Puritan 
laws and customs would allow him to put on. His hair was 
cropped close to his head, because Governor Endicott had for- 
bidden any man to wear it below the ears. But he was a very 
personable young man, and so thought the bridesmaids and Miss 
Betsey herself. 
The mint-master also was pleased with his new son-in-law, 
especially as he had courted Miss Betsey out of pure love, and 
had said nothing at all about her portion. So, when the mar- 
riage ceremony was over, Captain Hull whispered a word to two 
of his men-servants, who immediately went out, and soon re- 
turned lugging in a large pair of scales. They were such a pair 
as wholesale merchants use for weighing bulky commodities, and 
quite a bulky commodity was. now to be weighed in them. 
“Daughter Betsey,” said the mint-master, “get into one side 
of these scales.” 
Miss Betsey—or Mrs. Sewell, as we must now call her—did 
as she was bid, like a dutiful child, without any question of the 
why and wherefore. But what her father could mean, unless to 
_ mnake her husband pay for her by the pound (in which case she 
would have been a dear bargain), she had not the least idea. 
- “And now,” said honest John Hull to the servants, “bring that 
box hither.” 
The box to which the mint-master pointed was a huge, square, 
iron-bound oaken chest; it was big enough, my children, for all 
four of you to play at hide-and-seek in. The servants tugged

  with might and main, but could not lift this enormous receptacle, 
_and were finally obliged to drag it across the floor. Captain 
Hull then took a key from his girdle, unlocked the chest, and 
lifted its ponderous lid. Behold! it was full to the brim of bright 
pine-tree shillings fresh from the mint, and Samuel Sewell began 
to think that his father-in-law had got possession of all the money 
in the Massachusetts treasury. But it was only the mint-master’s 
honest share of the coinage. 
Then the servants, at Captain Hull’s command, heaped double: 
i handfuls of shillings into one side of the scales while Betsey 
remained in the other. Jingle, jingle, went the shillings as hand- 
ful after handful was thrown in, till, plump and ponderous as she- 
\ was, they fairly weighed the young lady from the floor. 
“There, son Sewell!” cried the honest mint-master, resuming 
‘5 his seat in Grandfather's chair, “take these shillings for my 
daughter’s portion. Use her kindly and thank Heaven for her.

“Charley, my boy,” said Grandfather, “do you remember who 
was the last occupant of the chair?” 
“Tt was Lieutenant-governor Hutchinson,” answered Charley. 
“Sir Francis Bernard, the new governor, had given him the chair 
instead of putting it away in the garret of the Province-house. 
And when we took leave of Hutchinson he was sitting by his fire- 
side and thinking of the past adventures of the chair and of what 
was to come.” 
“Very well,” said Grandfather, “and you recollect that this 
was in 1763 or thereabouts, at the close of the Old French War. 
Now, that you may fully comprehend the remaining adventures 
of the chair, I must make some brief remarks on the situation 
and character of the New England colonies at this period.” 
So Grandfather spoke of the earnest loyalty of our fathers 
during the Old French War and after the conquest of Canada 
had brought that war to a triumphant close. 
The people loved and reverenced the King of England even 
more than if the ocean had not rolled its waves between him 
and them, for at the distance of three thousand miles they could 
not discover his bad qualities and imperfections. Their love was 
increased by the dangers which they had encountered in order. 
to heighten his glory and extend his dominion. Throughout the 
war the American colonists had fought side by side with the 
soldiers of Old England, and nearly thirty thousand young men 
had laid down their lives for the honor of King George. And 
the survivors leved him the better because they had done and 
suffered so much for his sake. :

  But there were some circumstances that caused America to 
* feel more independent of England than at an earlier period. 
Canada and Acadia had now become British provinces, and our 
fathers were no longer afraid of the bands of French and Indians 
5 who used to assault them in old times. For a century and a half 
this had been the great terror of New England. Now the old 
French soldier was driven from the north forever. And even 
? had it been otherwise, the English colonies were growing so popu- 
lous and powerful that they might have felt fully able to protect 
10 themselves without any help from England. 
There were thoughtful and sagacious men who began to doubt 
whether a great country like America would always be content 
| to remain under the government of an island three thousand 
f miles away. This was the more doubtful because the English 
15 Parliament had long ago made laws which were intended to be 
' very beneficial to England at the expense of America. By these 
laws the colonists were forbidden to manufacture articles for 
their own use or to carry on trade with any nation but the English. 
“Now,” continued Grandfather, “if King George III and his 
\ 20 counselors had considered these things wisely, they would have 
| taken another course than they did. But when they saw-how 
  rich and populous the colonies had grown, their first thought was 
how they might make more profit out of them than heretofore. 
England was enormously in debt at the close of the Old French 
2s War, and it was pretended that this debt had been contracted for 
\ the defense of the American colonies, and that therefore a part of 
4 it ought to be paid by them.” 
“Why, this was nonsense!” exclaimed Charley. “Did not our 
fathers spend their lives, and their money too, to get Canada for 
30 King George?” 
“True, they did,” said Grandfather, “and they told the English 
tulers so. But the King and his ministers would not listen to 
3, good advice. In 1765 the British Parliament passed a stamp act.” 
‘ “What was that?” inquired Charley. 
% ~=©“The stamp act,” replied Grandfather, “was a law by which 
| all deeds, bonds, and other papers of the same kind were ordered 
  | 
to be marked with the king’s stamp, and without this mark they
-P-A-G-E-373
  356 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
were declared illegal and void. Now, in order to get a blank 
sheet of paper with the king’s stamp upon it, people were obliged 
to pay threepence more than the actual value of the paper. And 
_ this extra sum of threepence was a tax and was to be paid into 
s the king’s treasury.” 
“T am sure threepence was not worth quarreling about!” re- 
marked Clara. 8 
“It was not for threepence, nor for any amount of money, that 
America quarreled with England,” replied Grandfather; “it was 
1o for a great principle. The colonists were determined not * * 
taxed except by their own representatives. They said 
neither the King and Parliament nor any other power on -u..... 
had a right to take their money out of their pockets unless they 
freely gave it. And, rather than pay threepence when it was 
1s unjustly demanded, they resolved to sacrifice all the wealth of 
the country, and their lives along with it. They therefore made 
a most stubborn resistance to the stamp act.” 
“That was noble!” exclaimed Laurence. “I understand how 
it was. If they had quietly paid the tax of threepence, they 
20 would have ceased to be freemen and would have become tribu- 
taries of England. And so they contended’ about a great ques- 
tion of right and wrong, and put everything at stake for it.” 
“You are right, Laurence,” said Grandfather, “and it was really 
amazing and terrible to see what a change came over the aspect 
25 of the people the moment the English Parliament had passed this 
oppressive act. The former history of our chair, my children, 
has given you some idea of what a harsh, unyielding, stern set of 
men the old Puritans were. For a good many years back, how- 
ever, it had seemed as if these characteristics were disappearing. 
30 But no sooner did England offer wrong to the colonies than the 
descendants of the early settlers proved that they had the same 
kind of temper as their forefathers. The moment before, New 
England appeared like a humble and loyal subject of the Crown; 
the next instant she showed the grim, dark features of an old 
35 king-resisting Puritan.” 
Grandfather spoke briefly of the public measures that were 
takea in opposition to the stamp act. As this law affected all the

American colonies alike, it naturally led them to think of con- 
sulting together in order to procure its repeal. For this purpose 
the legislature of Massachusetts proposed that delegates from 
every colony should meet in congress. Accordingly, nine colo- 
nies, both Northern and Southern, sent delegates to the city of 
New York. 
“And did they consult about going to war with England?” 
asked Charley. 
“No, Charley,” answered Grandfather; “a great deal of talk- 
ing was yet to be done before England and America could come 
to blows. The Congress stated the rights and grievances of the 
colonists. They sent a humble petition to the King and a me- - 
morial to the Parliament beseeching that the stamp act might 
be repealed. This was all that the delegates had it in their 
power to do.” 
“They might as well have stayed at home, then,” said Charley. 
“By no means,” replied Grandfather. “It was a most impor- 
tant and memorable event, this first coming together of the 
American people by their representatives from the North and 
South. If England had been wise, she would have trembled at. 
the first word that was spoken in such an assembly.” 
These remonstrances and petitions, as Grandfather observed, 
were the work of grave, thoughtful, and prudent men. Mean- 
time the young and hot-headed people went to work in their own 
way. It is probable that the petitions of Congress would have 
had little or no effeet on the British statesmen if the violent. 
deeds of the American people had not shown how much excited 
the people were. Liberty Tree was soon heard of in England.” 
“What was Liberty Tree?” inquired Clara. : 
“Tt was an old elm tree,” answered Grandfather, “which stood 
near the corner of Essex street, opposite the Boylston Market. 
Under the spreading branches of this great tree the people used 
to assemble whenever they wished to express their feelings and 
opinions. Thus, after a while it seemed as if the liberty of the 
country was connected with Liberty Tree.” 
“ft was glorious fruit for a tree to bear,” remarked Laurence. 
“Tt bore strange fruit sometimes,” said Grandfather. “One

morning in August, 1765, two figures were found hanging on the 
sturdy branches of Liberty Tree. They were dressed in square- 
skirted coats and smallclothes, and as their wigs hung down over 
their faces they looked like real men. One was intended to rep- 
resent the Earl of Bute, who was supposed to have advised the 
King to tax America. The other was meant for the effigy of 
Andrew Oliver, a gentleman belonging to one of the most re- 
spectable families in Massachusetts.” 
“What harm had he done?” inquired Charley. 
“The King had appointed him to be distributer of the stamps,” 
answered Grandfather. “Mr. Oliver would have made a great 
deal of money by this business; but the people frightened him 
so much by hanging him in effigy, and afterward by breaking 
into his house, that he promised to have nothing to do with the 
stamps. And all the King’s friends throughout America were 
compelled to make the same promise.”

2 Grandfather’s Chair — / 8359 
  Bartisu Souprers Stationery 1n Boston 
The next evening, Clara, who remembered that our chair had 
been Jeft standing in the rain under Liberty Tree, earnestly be- 
sought Grandfather to tell when and where it had next found 
shelter. Perhaps she was afraid that the venerable chair, by 
being exposed to the inclemency of a September gale, might get 
the rheumatism in its aged joints. : 
“The chair,” said Grandfather, “after the ceremony of Mr. 
Oliver’s oath, appears to have been quite forgotten by the multi- 
tude. Indeed, being much bruised and rather rickety, owing to 
thé violent treatment it had suffered from the Hutchinson mob, 
most people would have thought that its days of usefulness were 
over. Nevertheless, it was conveyed away under cover of the 
night and committed to the care of a skillful joiner. He doctored 
our old friend so successfully that in the course of a few days it 
made its appearance in the public room ofthe British Coffee- 
house in King Strect.” 
“But why did not Mr. Hutchinson get possession of it again?” 
inquired Charley. 
“T know not,” answered Grandfather, “unless he considered it 
a dishonor and disgrace to the chair to have stood under Liberty 
Tree. At all. events, he suffered it to remain at the British 
Coffee-house, which was the principal hotel in Boston. It could 
not possibly have found a situation where it would be more in 
the midst of business and bustle, or would witness more impor- 
tant events, or be occupied by a greater variety of persons.” 
Grandfather went on to tell the proceedings of the despotic 
King and ministry of England after the repeal of the stamp act. — 
They could not bear to think that their right to tax America 
should be disputed by the people. In the year 1767, therefore, 
they caused Parliament to pass an act for laying a duty on tea 
and some other articles that were in general use. Nobody could 
now buy a pound of tea without paying a tax to King George. 
This scheme was pretty craftily contrived, for the women of
-P-A-G-E-377
roe a 2 3 PS & 
  360 Junior High School Literature, Book One eS Ee OE 
America were very fond of tea, and did not like to give up the 
use of it. 
But the people were as much opposed to this new act of Parlia- 
ment as they had been to the stamp act. England, however, was 
determined that they should submit. In order to compel their 
obedience two regiments, consisting of more than seven hundred 
British soldiers, were sent to Boston. They arrived in September, 
1768, and were landed on Long Wharf. Thence they marched to 
the Common with loaded muskets, fixed bayonets, and great 
pomp and parade. So now at last the free town of Boston was 
guarded and overawed by red-coats as it had been in the days of 
old Sir Edmond Andros. 
In the month of November more regiments arrived. There 
were now four thousand troops in Boston. The Common was 
whitened with their tents. Some of the soldiers were lodged in 
Faneuil Hall, which the inhabitants looked upon as a consecrated 
place because it had been the scene of a great many meetings in 
favor of liberty. One regiment was placed in the Town House, 
which we now call the Old State House. The lower floor of this 
edifice had hitherto been used by the merchants as an exchange. 
In the upper stories were the chambers of the judges, the repre- 
sentatives, and the governor’s council. The venerable councilors 
could not assemble to consult about the’ welfare of the province 
without being challenged by sentinels and passing among the 
bayonets of the British soldiers. 
Sentinels likewise were posted at the lodgings of the officers 
in many parts of the town. When the inhabitants approached, 
they were greeted by the sharp question, “Who goes there?” 
while the rattle of the soldier’s musket was heard as he presented 
it against their breasts. There was no quiet even on the Sabbath 
day. The pious descendants of the Puritans were shocked by 
the uproar of military music, the drum, fife, and bugle drowning 
the holy organ-peal and the voices of the singers. It would 
appear as if the British took every method to insult the feelings 
of the people. 
“Grandfather,” cried Charley, impatiently, “the people did 
not go to fighting half soon enough! These British red-coats
-P-A-G-E-378
ow 
  
  Grandfather’s Chair 361 
ought to have been driven back to their vessels the very moment. 
they landed on Long Wharf.” 
“Many a hot-headed young man said the same as you do, 
Charley,” answered Grandfather, “but the elder and wiser people 
saw that the time was not yet come. Meanwhile, let us take 
another peep at our old chair.” 
“Ah, it drooped its head, I know,” said Charley, when it 
saw how the province was disgraced. Tis old Puritan friends never’ 
would have borne such doings.” 
“The chair,” proceeded Grandfather, “was now continually’ 
occupied by some of the high Tories, as the King’s friends were 
called, who frequented the British Coffee House. Officers of the 
custom-house too, which stood on the opposite side of King Street, 
often sat in the chair wagging their tongues against John 
Hancock.” 
“Why against him?” asked Charley. . 
“Because he was a great merchant and contended against 
paying duties to the King,” said Grandfather. 
“Well, frequently, no doubt, the officers of the British regi- 
ments, when not on duty, used to fling themselves into the arms 
of our venerable chair. Fancy one of them a red-nosed captain 
in his scarlet uniform, playing with the hilt of his sword and 
making a circle of his brother officers merry with ridiculous jokes 
at the expense of the poor Yankees. And perhaps he would call 
for a bottle of wine or a steaming bowl of punch and drink con- 
fusion to all rebels.” 
“Our grave old chair must have been scandalized at such 
scenes,” observed Laurence—“the chair that had been the Lady 
Arbella’s and which the holy apostle Eliot had consecrated.” 
“Tt certainly was little less than sacrilege,” replied Grand- 
father; “but the time was coming when even the churches where 
hallowed pastors had long preached the word of God were to be 
torn down or desecrated by the British troops. Some years passed, 
however, before such things were done.” : 
Grandfather now told his auditors that in 1769 Sir Francis 
Bernard went to England, after having been governor of Massa- 
chusetts ten years. He was a gentleman of many good qualities,
-P-A-G-E-379
  362 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
an excellent scholar, and a friend to learning. But he was nat- 
‘orally of an arbitrary disposition, and he had been bred at the 
University of Oxford, where young men were taught that the 
divine right of kings was the only thing to be regarded in matters 
6 of government. Such ideas were ill adapted to please the people 
of Massachusetts. They rejoiced to get rid of Sir Francis Bernard, 
but liked his successor, Lieutenant-governc: Hutchinson, no 
better than himself. 
About this period the people were much incensed at an act 
a¢ committed by a person who held an office in the custom-house. 
Some lads or young men were snowballing his windows. He 
fired a musket at them and killed a poor boy only eleven years 
oid. This event made a great noise in town and country, and 
much increased the resentment that was already felt against the 
as servants of the Crown. 
“Now, children,” said Grandfather, “I wish to make you com- 
prehend the position of the British troops in King Street. This is 
the same which we now call State Street. On the south side of 
the Town House, or Old State House, was what military men call 
zo a court of guard, defended by two brass cannons which pointed 
directly at one of the doors of the above edifice... A large party 
of soldiers were always stationed in the court of guard. The 
custom-house stood at a little distance down King Street, nearly 
where the Suffolk Bank now stands, and a sentinel was continu- 
2s ally pacing before its front.” 
“T shall remember this tomorrow,” said Charley, “and I will 
‘go to State Street, so as to see exactly where the British troops 
were stationed.” 
“And before long,” observed Grandfather, “I shall have to 
so relate an event which made King Street sadly famous on both 
sides of the Atlantic. The history of our chair will soon bring 
us to this melancholy business.” 
Here Grandfather described the state of things which arose 
from the ill-will that existed between the inhabitants and the 
ss red-coats. The old and sober part of the townspeople were very 
angry at the government for sending soldiers to overawe them. 
But those gray-headed men were cautious, and kept their thoughts
-P-A-G-E-380
ER i S 
  Grandfather’s Chair 363 
  and feelings in their own breasts, without putting themselves in 
the way of the British bayonets. 
The younger people, however, could hardly be kept within 
such prudent limits. They reddened with wrath at the very sight 
of a soldier, and would have been willing to come to blows with 
them at any moment. For it was their opinion that every tap of 
a British drum within the peninsula of Boston was an insult to the 
brave old town. 
“It was sometimes the case,” continued Grandfather, “that 
affrays happened between such wild young men as these and 
small parties of the soldiers. No weapons had hitherto been 
used except fists or cudgels. But when men have loaded muskets 
in their hands, it is easy to foretell that they will soon be turned 
against the bosoms of those who provoke their anger.” 
“Grandfather,” said little Alice, looking fearfully into his 
face, “your voice sounds as though you were going to tell us 
something awful.”

Tu Boston Massacre 
Little Alice, by her last remark, proved herself a good judge 
of what was expressed by the tones of Grandfather’s voice. He 
had given the above description of the enmity between the towns- 
people and the soldiers in order to prepare the minds of his audi- 
tors for a very terrible event. It was one that did more to 
heighten the quarrel between England and America than any- 
thing that had yet occurred. 
Without further preface Grandfather began the story of the 
Boston Massacre. 
It was now the 3d of March, 1770. The sunset music of the 
British regiments was heard as usual throughout the town. The 
shrill fife and rattling drum awoke the echoes in King Street while 
the last ray of sunshine was lingering on the cupola of the Town 
House. And now all the sentinels were posted. One of them 
marched up and down before the custom-house, treading a short 
path through the snow and longing for the time when he would 
be dismissed to the warm fireside of the guard-room. Mean- 
while, Captain Preston was perhaps sitting in our great chair 
before the hearth of the British Coffee House. In the course of 
the evening there were two or three slight commotions which 
seemed to indicate that trouble was at hand. Small parties of 
young men stood at the corners of the streets or walked along the 
narrow pavements. Squads of soldiers who were dismissed from 
duty passed by them, shoulder to shoulder, with the regular step 
which they had learned at the drill. Whenever these encounters 
took place it appeared to be the object of the young men to treat 
the soldiers with as much incivility as possible. 
“Turn out, you lobster-backs!” one would say. “Crowd them 
off the sidewalks!” another-would cry. “A red-coat has no right 
in Boston streets!” 
“Oh, you rebel rascals!” perhaps the soldiers would reply, 
glaring fiercely at the young men. “Some day or other we’ll make 
our way through Boston streets at the point of the bayonet!”
-P-A-G-E-382

4 Once or twice such disputes as these brought on a scuffle, which 
passed off, however, without attracting much notice. About 
eight o’clock, for some unknown cause, an alarm bell rang loudly -” 
and hurriedly. 
s At the sound many people ran out of their houses, supposing 
it to be an alarm of fire. But there were no flames to be seen, nor 
was there any smell of smoke in the clear, frosty air, so that. most 
of the townsmen went back to their own firesides and sat talking 
with their wives and children about the calamities of the times. 
Others who were younger and less prudent remained in the streets, 
for there seems to have been a presentiment that some strange 
event was on the eve of taking place. 
Later in the evening, not far from nine o’clock, several young 
men passed by the Town House and walked down King Street.: 
The sentinel was still on his post in front of the custom-house, 
pacing to and fro, while as he turned, a gleam of light from some = = = a 
no great distance were the barracks and the guard-house, where 
his comrades were probably telling stories of battle and bloodshed. 
2 Down toward the custom-house, as I told you, came a party 
of wild young men. When they drew near the sentinel he halted 
on his post and took his musket from his shoulder, ready to pre- 
sent the bayonet at their breasts. 
“Who goes there?” he cried, in the gruff, peremptory tones of 
25 4 soldier’s challenge. 
The young men, being Boston boys, felt as if they had a right 
to walk their own streets without being accountable to a British 
red-coat, even though he challenged them in King George’s name. 
They made some rude answer to the sentinel. There was a dis- | neighboring window glittered on the barrel of his musket. At 
i 
ran hastily from the barracks to assist their comrades. At the 
same time many of the townspeople rushed into King Street by 
various avenues and gathered in a crowd round about the custom- ‘ pute, or perhaps a scuffle.. Other soldiers heard the noise, and 
house. It seemed wonderful how such a multitude had started 
ss up all of a sudden. 
The wrongs and insults. which the people had been suffering 
for many months now kindled them into a rage. They threw
-P-A-G-E-383
  366 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
snowballs and lumps of ice at the soldiers. As the tumult grew 
louder it reached the ears of Captain Preston, the officer of the 
‘day. He immediately ordered eight soldiers of the main guard oe to take their muskets and follow him. They marched across the 
street, forcing their way roughly through the crowd and pricking 
the townspeople with their bayonets. 
A gentleman (it was Henry Knox, afterward general of the 
American artillery) caught Captain Preston’s arm. 
“For Heaven’s sake, sir,” exclaimed he, “take heed what you 
9 do or there will be bloodshed!” 
“Stand aside!” answered Captain Preston, haughtily.. “Do 
not interfere, sir. Leave me to manage the affair.” 
Arriving at the sentinel’s post, Captain Preston drew up his 
‘ men in a semicircle with their faces to the crowd and their rear 
ul to the custom-house. When the people saw the officer and beheld 
the threatening attitude with which the soldiers fronted them 
their rage became almost uncontrollable. 
“Fire, you lobster-backs!” bellowed some. 
“You dare not fire, you cowardly red-coats!” cried others. 
“Rush upon them!” shouted many voices. ‘Drive the rascals 
to their barracks! Down with them! Down with them! Let 
them fire if they dare!” 
Amid the uproar the soldiers stood glaring at the people with 
the fierceness of men whose trade was.to shed blood. 
Oh, what a crisis had now arrived! Up to this very moment 
the angry feelings between England and America might have 
been pacified. England had but to stretch out the hand of recon- 
ciliation and acknowledge that she had hitherto mistaken her 
rights, but would do sono more. Then the ancient bonds of broth- 
erhood would again have been knit together as firmly as in old 
times. The habit of loyalty which had grown as strong as instinct 
was not utterly overcome. The perils shared, the victories won, 
in the Old French War, when the soldiers of the colonies fought 
side by side with their comrades from beyond the sea, were unfor- 
gotten’ yet. England was still that beloved country which the 
colonists called their home. King George, though he had frowned 
upon America, was still reverenced as a father. i

But should the King’s soldiers shed one drop of American 
blood, then it was a quarrel to’ the death. Never, never would 
America rest satisfied until she had torn down the royal authority 
and trampled it in the dust. 
“Fire if you dare, villains!” hoarsely shouted the people while 
the muzzles of the muskets were turned upon them. “You dare . 
not fire!” 
They appeared ready to rush upon the level bayonets. Cap- 
.tain Preston waved his sword and uttered a command which 
could not be distinctly heard amid the uproar of shouts that issued 
from a hundred throats. But his seldiers deemed that he had 
spoken the fatal mandate, “Fire!” The flash of their muskets. 
lighted up the street, and the report rang loudly between the 
edifices. It was said, too, that the figure of a man with a cloth’ 
hanging down over his face was seen to step into the balcony 
of the custom-house and discharge a musket at the crowd. 
A gush of smoke had overspread the scene. It rose heavily, as 
if it were loath to reveal the dreadful spectacle beneath it. Eleven 
of the sons of New England lay stretched upon the street. Some, 
sorely wounded, were struggling to rise again. Others stirred not 
nor groaned, for they were past all pain. Blood was streaming 
upon the snow, and that purple stain in the midst of King Street, 
though it melted away in the next day’s sun, was never forgotten 
nor forgiven by the people. . 
Grandfather was interrupted by the violent sobs of little Alice. 
In his earnestness he had neglected to soften down the narrative 
so that it might not terrify the heart of this unworldly infant. 
Since Grandfather began the history of our chair little Alice had 
listened to many tales of war, but probably the idea had never 
really impressed itself upon her mind that men had shed the blood 
of their fellow-creatures. And now that this idea was forcibly 
presented to her, it affected the sweet child with bewilderment 
and horror. . / 
“I ought to have remembered our dear little Alice,” said 
Grandfather reproachfully to himself. “Oh, what a pity! Her 
heavenly nature has now received its first impression of earthly - 
sin and violence—Well, Clara, take her to- bed and comfort her.

Heaven grant that she may dream away the recollection of the 
Boston massacre!” 
“Grandfather,” said Charley when Clara and little Alice had 
retired, “did not the people rush upon the soldiers and take 
revenge?” 
“The town drums beat to arms,” replied Grandfather, “the 
alarm-bells rang, and an immense multitude rushed into King 
Street. Many of them had weapons in their hands. The British 
prepared to defend themselves. A whole regiment was drawn up 
in the street expecting an attack, for the townsmen appeared 
ready to throw themselves upon the bayonets.” 
“And how did it end?” asked Charley. 
“Governor Hutchinson hurried to the spot,” said Grandfather, 
‘and besought the people to have patience, promising that strict 
justice should be done. A day or two afterward the British troops 
were withdrawn from town and stationed at Castlé William. 
‘Captain Preston and the eight soldiers were tried for murder, but 
none of them were found guilty, The judges told the jury that 
the insults and violence which had been offered to the soldiers 
justified them in firing at the mob.” 
“The Revolution,” observed Laurence, who had said but little 
during the evening, “was not such a calm, majestic movement as 
I supposed. I do not love to hear of mobs and broils in the street. 
These things were unworthy of the people when they had such a 
great object to accomplish.” 
“Nevertheless, the world has seen no grander movement than 
that of our Revolution from first to last,” said Grandfather. “The 
people, to a man, were full of a great and noble sentiment. True, 
there may be much fault to find with their mode of expressing this 
sentimrent, but they knew no better; the necessity was upon them 
to act out their feelings in the best manner they could. We must 
forgive what was wrong in their actions, and look into their hearts 
and minds for the honorable motives that impelled them.” 
“And I suppose,” said Laurence, “there were men who knew 
how to act worthily of what they felt.” 
“There were many such,” replied Grandfather, “and we will 
speak of some of them hereafter.”

Grandfather here made a pause. That night Charley had a 
dream about the Boston massacre, and thought that he himself 
was in the crowd and struck down Captain Preston with a great 
club, Laurence dreamed that he was sitting in our great chair 
at the window of the British Coffee-house, and beheld the whole 
scene which Grandfather had described. It seemed to him, in his 
dream, that if the townspeople and the soldiers would have but 
heard him speak a single word, all the slaughter might have been 
averted. But there was such an uproar that it drowned his voice. 
The next morning the two boys went together to State Street 
and stood on the very spot where the first blood of the Revolution 
had been shed. The Old State House was still there, presenting 
almost the same aspect that it had worn on that memorable eve- 
ning one and seventy years ago. It is the sole remaining witness 
of the Boston massacre.

Some Famous Portraits 
The next evening the astral lamp was lighted earlier than 
usual, because Laurence was very much engaged in looking over 
the collection of portraits which had been his New Year’s gift 
from Grandfather. 
Among them he found the features of more than one famous 
personage who had been connected with the adventures of our old 
chair. Grandfather bade him draw the table nearer to the fire- 
side, and they looked over the portraits-together, while Clara and 
Charley likewise lent their attention. As for little Alice, she sat 
in Grandfather’s lap, and seemed to see the very men alive whose 
faces were there represented. 
Turning over the volume, Laurence came to the portrait ofa 
stern, grim-looking man in plain attire, of much more modern 
fashion than that of the old Puritans. But the face might well 
have befitted one of those iron-hearted men. Beneath the por- 
trait was the name of Samuel Adams. 
“He was a man of great note in all the doings that brought 
about the Revolution,” said Grandfather. “His character was 
such that it seemed as if one of the ancient Puritans had been sent 
back to earth to animate the people’s hearts with the same abhor- 
rence of tyranny that had distinguished the earliest settlers. He 
was as religious as they, as stern and inflexible, and as deeply im- 
bued- with democratic principles. He, better than any one else, 
may be taken as a representative of the people of New England, 
and of the spirit with which they engaged in the Revolutionary 
struggle. He was a poor man, and earned his bread by a humble 
occupation, but with his tongue and pen he made the King of Eng- 
land tremble on his throne. Remember him, my children, as one 
of the strong men of our country.” 
“Here is one whose looks show a very different character,” 
observed Laurence, turning to the portrait of John Hancock. “I 
should think, by his splendid dress and courtly aspect, that he 
was one of the King’s friends.”
-P-A-G-E-388

  Grandfather’s Chair 371 
“There never was a greater contrast than between Samuel 
Adams and John Hancock,” said Grandfather, “yet they were 
of the same side in politics, and had an equal agency in the Revo- 
lution. Hancock was born to the inheritance of the largest for- 
tune in New England. His tastes and habits were aristocratic. 
He loved gorgeous attire, a splendid mansion, magnificent furni- 
ture, stately festivals, and all that was glittering and pompous in 
external things. His manners were so polished that there stood 
not a nobleman at the footstool of King George’s throne who was 
a more skillful courtier than John Hancock might have been. 
Nevertheless, he in his embroidered clothes and Samuel Adams in 
his threadbare coat wrought together in the cause of liberty. 
Adams acted from pure and rigid principle. Hancock, though he 
loved his country, yet thought quite as much of his own popularity 
as he did of the people’s rights. It is remarkable that these two 
men, so very different as I describe them, were the only two 
exempted from pardon by the King’s proclamation.” 
On the next leaf of the book was the portrait of General 
Joseph Warren. Charley recognized the name, and said that here 
was a greater man than either Hancock or Adams. 
“Warren was an eloquent and able patriot,” replied Grand- 
father. “He deserves a lasting memory for his zealous efforts 
in behalf of liberty. No man’s voice was more powerful in Faneuil 
Halt than Joseph Warren’s. If his death had not happened so 
early in the contest, he would probably have gained a high name 
as a soldier.” : 
The next portrait was a venerable man who held his thumb 
under his chin, and through his spectacles appeared to be atten- 
tively reading a manuscript. 
“Here we see the most illustrious Boston boy that ever lived,” 
said Grandfather. “This is Benjamin Franklin. But I will not 
try to compress into a few sentences the character of the sage 
who, as a Frenchman expressed it, snatched the lightning from 
the sky and the scepter from a tyrant. Mr. Sparks must help 
you to the knowledge of Franklin.” 
The book likewise contained portraits of James Otis and 
Josiah Quincy. Both of them, Grandfather observed, were men

  of wonderful talents and true patriotism. Their voices were 
like the stirring tones of a trumpet arousing the country to defend 
its freedom. Heaven seemed to have provided a greater number 
of eloquent men than had appeared at any other period, in order 
that the people might be fully instructed as to their wrongs and 
the method of resistance. 
“Tt is marvelous,” said Grandfather, “to see how many power- 
ful writers, orators, and soldiers started up just at the time when 
they were wanted. There was a man for every kind of work. It 
is equally wonderful that men of such different characters were 
all made to unite in the one object of establishing the freedom 
and independence of America. There was an overruling Provi- 
dence above them.” 
“Here was another great man,” rengarked Laurence, pointing 
to the portrait of John Adams. 
“Yes; an earnest, warm-tempered, honest, and most able 
man,” said Grandfather. “At the period of which we are now 
speaking he was a lawyer in Boston. He was destined in after 
years to be ruler over the whole American people, whom he con- 
tributed so much to form into a nation.” 
Grandfather here remarked that many a New Englander who 
had passed his boyhood and youth in obscurity afterward attained 
to a fortune which he never could have foreseen even in his most 
ambitious dreams. John Adams, the second President of the 
United States and the equal of crowned kings, was once a school- 
master and country lawyer. Hancock, the first signer of the 
Declaration of Independence, served his apprenticeship with a 
merchant. Samue! Adams, afterward governor of Massachusetts, 
was a small tradesman and a tax-gatherer. General Warren was 
a physician, General Lincoln a farmer, and General Knox a book- 
binder. General Nathaniel Greene, the best soldier except Wash- 
ington in the Revolutionary army, was a Quaker and a black- 
smith. All these became illustrious men, and can never be for- 
gotten in American history. 
“And any boy who is born in America may look forward to 
the same things,” said our ambitious friend Charley. 
After these observations Grandfather drew the book of por-

traits toward him, showed the children several British peers and 
members of Parliament who had exerted themselves either for or 
against. the rights of America. There were the Earl of Bute, 
Mr. Grenville, and Lord North. These were looked upon as 
deadly enemies to our country. 
Among the friends of America was Mr. Pitt, afterward Earl 
of Chatham, who spent so much of his wondrous eloquence in 
endeavoring to warn England of the consequences of her injus- 
tice. He fell down on the floor of the House of Lords after utter- 
ing his almost dying words in defense of our privileges as free- 
men. There was Edmund Burke, one of the wisest men and great- 
est, orators that ever the world produced. There was Colonei 
Barré, who had been among our fathers, and knew that they had 
courage enough to die for their rights. There was Charles James 
Fox, who never rested until he had silenced our enemies in the 
House of Commons. 
“It is very remarkable to observe how many of the ablest 
orators in the British Parliament were favorable to America,” 
said Grandfather. “We ought to remember these great English- 
men with gratitude, for their speeches encouraged our fathgrs 
almost as much as those of our own orators in Faneuil Hall and 
under Liberty Tree. Opinions which might have been received 
with doubt if expressed only by a native American were set down 
as true beyond dispute when they came from the lips of Chatham, 
Burke, Barré, or Fox.” 
“But, Grandfather,” asked Laurence, “were there no able and 
eloquent men in this country who took the part of King George?” 
“There were many men of talent who said what they could in 
defense of the King’s tyrannical proceedings,” replied Grand- 
father, “but they had the worst side of the argument, and there- 
fore seldom said anything worth remembering. Moreover, their 
hearts were faint and feeble, for they felt that the people scorned 
and detested them. They had no friends, no defense, except in the 
bayonets of the British troops. A blight fell upon all their fac- 
ulties, because they were contending against the rights of their 
own native land.” 
“What were the names of some of them?” inquired Charley.
-P-A-G-E-391

“Governor Hutchinson, Chief-justice Oliver, Judge Auch- 
muty, the Reverend Mather Byles, and several other clergymen 
were among the most noted loyalists,” answered Grandfather. 
“I wish the people had tarred and feathered every man of 
them!” cried Charley. 
“That wish is very wrong, Charley,” said Grandfather. “You 
must not thixk that there was no integrity and honor. except 
among those who stood up for the freedom of America. For aught 
I know, there was quite as much of these qualities on one side 
as on the other. Do you see nothing admirable in a faithful 
adherence to an unpopular cause? Can you not respect that prin- 
ciple of loyalty which made the royalists give up country, friends, 
fortune, everything, rather than be false to their king? It was a 
mistaken principle, but many of them cherished it honorably and 
were martyrs to it.” 
“Oh, I was wrong,” said Charley, ingenuously. “And I would 
risk my life rather than one of those good old royalists should be 
tarred and feathered.” 
“The time is now come when we may judge fairly of them,” 
eqntinued Grandfather. “Be the good and true men among them 
honored, for they were as much our countrymen as the patriots 
were, And, thank Heaven! our country need not be ashamed of 
her sons—of most of them at least—whatever side they took in 
the Revolutionary contest.” 
Among the portraits was one of King George III. Little Alice 
clapped her hands and seemed pleased with the bluff good nature 
of his physiognomy. But Laurence thought it strange that a man 
with such a face, indicating hardly a common share of intellect, 
should have had influence enough on human affairs to convulse 
the world with war. Grandfather observed that this poor king 
had always appeared to him one of the most unfortunate persons 
that ever lived. He was so honest and conscientious. that if he 
had been only a private man his life would probably have been 
blameless and happy. But his was that worst of fortunes—to be 
placed in a station far beyond his abilities. 
“And so,” said Grandfather, “his life, while he retained what 
intellect Heaven had gifted him with, was one long mortification.

At last he grew crazed with care and trouble. For nearly twenty 
years the monarch of England was confined as a madman. In his 
old age, too, God took away his eyesight, so. that his royal palace 
was nothing to him but a dark, lonesome prison-house.”

THE GRAY CHAMPION 
NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE 
There was once a time when New England groaned under the 
actual pressure of heavier wrongs than those threatened ones 
which brought on the Revolution. James II, the bigoted suc- 
cessor of Charles the Voluptuous, had annulled the charters of all 
5 the colonies, and sent a harsh and unprincipled. soldier to take 
away our liberties and endanger our religion. The administra- 
tion of Sir Edmund Andros lacked scarcely a single characteristic 
' of tyranny: a Governor and Council, holding office from the King, 
and wholly independent of the country; laws made and taxes 
10 levied without concurrence of the people, immediate or by their 
representatives; the rights of private citizens violated, and the 
titles of all landed property declared void; the voice of complaimt 
stifled by restrictions on the press; and, finally, disaffection over- 
awed by the first band of mercenary troops that ever marched on 
1s our free soil. For two years our ancestors were kept in sullen 
submission by that filial love which had invariably secured their 
allegiance to the mother country, whether its head chanced 
to be a Parliament, Protector, or Monarch. Till these evil 
times, however, such allegiance had been merely nominal, and the 
20 colonists had ruled themselves, enjoying far more freedom than 
is even yet the privilege of the native subjects of Great Britain. 
At length a rumor reached our shores that the Prince of Orange 
had ventured on an enterprise the success of which would be the 
triumph of civil and religious rights and the salvation of New 
25 England. It was but a doubtful whisper; it might be false, or 
the attempt might fail; and, in either case, the man that stirred 
against King James would lose his head. Still, the intelligence 
produced a marked effect. The people smiled mysteriously in the 
streets, and threw bold glances at their oppressors; while, far and 
80 wide, there was a subdued and silent agitation, as if the slightest 
signal would rouse the whole land from its sluggish despondency. 
Aware of their danger, the rulers resolved to avert it by an impos-

  ing display of strength, and perhaps to confirm their despotism by 
yet ha?sher measures. One afternoon in April, 1689, Sir Edmund 
Andros and his favorite councilors, being warm with wine, as- 
sembled the redeoats of the Governors’ Guard, and made their 
3 appearance in the streets of Boston, The sun was near setting 
when the march commenced. 
The roll of the drum, at that unquiet crisis, seemed to go 
through the streets, less as the martial music of the soldiers, than 
as a muster-call to the inhabitants themselves. A multitude, by 
various avenues, assembled in King Street, which was destined to 
be the scene, nearly a century afterwards, of another encounter 
between the troops of Britain and a people struggling against her 
tyranny. Though more than sixty years had elapsed since the 
Pilgrims came, this crowd of their descendants still showed the 
strong and somber features of their character, perhaps more strik- 
ingly in such a stern emergency than on happier occasions. There 
was the sober garb, the general severity of mien, the gloomy but 
undismayed expression, the Scriptural forms of speech, and the 
confidence in Heaven’s blessing on a righteous cause, which would 
have marked a band of the original Puritans, when threatened 
by some peril of the wilderness. Indeed, it was not yet time fez 
the old spirit to be extinct; since there were men in the street, that 
day, who had worshiped there beneath the trees, before a house 
was reared to the God for whom they had become exiles. Old sol- 
diers of the Parliament were here, too, smiling grimly at the 
thought that their aged arms might strike another blow against 
the house of Stuart. Here, also, were the veterans of King Philip’s 
war, who had burned villages and slaughtered young and old, with 
pious fierceness, while the godly souls throughout the land were 
helping them with prayer. Several ministers were scattered among 
the crowd, which, unlike all other mobs, regarded them with such 
reverence as if there were sanctity in their very garments. ‘These 
holy men exerted their influence to quiet the people, but not to 
disperse them. Meantime, the purpose of the Governor, in dis- 
turbing the peace of the town, at a period when the slightest com- 
motion might throw the country into a ferment, was almost the 
universal subject of inquiry, and variously explained.

- “Satan will strike his master-stroke presently,” cried some, 
“because he knoweth that his time is short. All our godly pastors 
are to be dragged to prison! We shall see them at a Smithfield fire 
in King Street!” / 
Hereupon the people of each parish gathered closer round their 
minister, who looked calmly upwards and assumed a more apos- 
tolic dignity, as well befitted a candidate for the highest honor 
of his profession, the crown of martyrdom. It was actually fan- 
cied, at that period, that New England might have a John Rogers 
of her own, to take the place of that worthy in the Primer. 
“We are to be massacred, both man and male child!” cried 
others. : 
Neither was this rumor wholly discredited, although the 
wiser class believed the Governor’s object somewhat less atrocious. 
His predecessor under the old charter, Bradstreet, a venerable 
companion of the first settlers, was known to be in town. 
There were grounds for conjecturing that Sir Edmund Andros 
intended, at once, to strike terror, by a parade of military force, 
and to confound the opposite faction by possessing himself of 
their chief. 
“Stand firm for the old charter, Governor!” shouted the crowd, 
seizing upon the idea. “The good old Governor Bradstreet!” 
While this cry was at the loudest, the people were surprised 
by the well-known figure of Governor Bradstreet himself, a patri- 
arch of nearly ninety, who appeared on the elevated steps of a 
door, and, with characteristic mildness, besought them to submit 
to the constituted authorities. 
“My children,” concluded this venerable person, “do nothing 
rashly. Cry not aloud, but pray for the welfare of New England, 
and expect patiently what the Lord will do in this matter!” 
The event was soon to be decided. All this time the roll of the 
drum had been approaching through Cornhill, louder and deeper, 
till with reverberations from house to house, and the regular tramp 
of martial footsteps, it burst into the street. A double rank of 
soldiers made their appearance, occupying the whole breadth of 
the passage, with shouldered matchlocks, and matches burning, 
so as to present a row of fires in the dusk. Their steady march
-P-A-G-E-396
The Gray Champion 379 
    
was like the progress of a machine, that would roll irresistibly 
over everything in its way. Next, moving slowly, with a confused 
clatter of hoofs on the pavement, rode a party of mounted gentle- 
men, the central figure being Sir Edmund Andros, elderly, but 
erect and soldier-like. Those around him were his favorite coun- 
cilors, and the bitterest foes of New England. At his right hand 
rode Edward Randolph, our arch-enemy, that “blasted wretch,” 
as Cotton Mather calls him, who achieved the downfall of our 
ancient government, and was followed with a sensible curse, 
‘through life and to his grave. On the other side was Bullivant, 
scattering jests and mockery as he rode along. Dudley came be- 
hind, with a downcast look, dreading, as well he might, to meet. the 
indignant gaze of the people, who beheld him, their only country- 
man by birth, among the oppressors of his native land. The cap- 
tain of a frigate in the harbor, and two or three civil officers under 
the Crown, were also there. But the figure which most attracted 
the public eye, and stirred up the deepest feeling, was the Epis- 
copal clergyman of King’s Chapel, riding haughtily among the 
magistrates in his priestly vestments, the fitting representative of 
prelacy and persecution, the union of Church and State, and all 
those abominations which had driven the Puritans to the wilder- 
| ness. Another guard of soldiers, in double rank, brought up the 
rear, 
The whole scene was a picture of the condition of New Eng- 
land, and its moral, the deformity of any government that does 
| not grow out of the nature of things and the character of the 
people. On one side the religious multitude, with their sad visages 
and dark ‘attire, and on the other, the group of despotic rulers, 
with the High-Churchman in the midst, and here and there a 
bo crucifix at their bosoms, all magnificently clad, flushed with wine, 
roud of unjust authority, and scoffing at the universal groan. 
ind the mercenary soldiers, waiting but the word to deluge the 
treet with blood, showed the only means by which obedience 
ould be secured, . 
“O Lord of Hosts,” cried a voice among the crowd, “provide a 
shampion for thy people!” 
This ejaculation was loudly uttered, and served as a herald’s on : S 
b
-P-A-G-E-397
on 
  380 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
ery, to introduce a remarkable personage. The crowd had rolled 
back, and were now huddled together nearly at the extremity of 
the street, while the soldiers had advanced no more than a third 
of its length. The intervening space was empty—a paved soli- 
tude, between lofty edifices, which threw almost.a twilight shadow 
over it. Suddenly, there was seen the figure of an ancient man, 
who seemed to have emerged from among the people, and was 
walking by himself along the center of the street, to confront the 
armed band. He wore the old Puritan dress, a dark cloak and a 
steeple-crowned hat, in the fashion of at least fifty years before, 
with a heavy sword upon his thigh, but a staff in his hand to 
assist the tremulous gait of age. 
When at some distancé from the multitude, the old man turned 
slowly round, displaying a face of antique majesty, rendered 
doubly venerable by the hoary beard that descended on his breast. 
He made a gesture at once of encouragement and warning, then 
turned again, and resumed his way. 
“Who is this gray patriarch?” asked the young men of their 
sires. 
“Who is this venerable brother?” asked the old men among 
themselves. 
But none could make reply. The fathers of the people, those 
of fourscore years and upwards, were disturbed, deeming it 
strange that they should forget one of such evident authority, 
whom they must have known in their early days, the associate 
of Winthrop, and all the old councilors, giving laws, and making 
prayers, and leading them against the savage. The elderly men 
ought to have remembered him, too, with locks as gray in their 
youth as their own were now. And the young! How could he 
have passed so utterly from their memories—that hoary sire, the 
relic of long-departed times, whose awful benediction had surely 
been bestowed on their uncovered heads, in childhood? 
“Whence did he come? What is his purpose? Who can this 
‘old man be?” whispered the wondering crowd. 
Meanwhile, the venerable stranger, staff in hand, was pur- 
suing his solitary walk along the center of the street. As he drew 
near the advancing soldiers, and as the roll of their drum came
-P-A-G-E-398
30   
The Gray. Champion 381   
full upon his ear, the old man raised himself to a loftier mien, 
while the decrepitude of age seemed to fall from his shoulders, 
leaving him in gray but unbroken dignity. Now, he marched 
onward with a warrior’s step, keeping time to the military music. 
Thus the aged form advanced on one side, and the whole parade 
of soldiers and magistrates on the other, till, when scarcely twenty 
yards remained between, the old man grasped his staff by the 
middle, and held it before him like a leader’s truncheon. 
“Stand!” cried he. 
The eye, the face, and attitude of command, the solemn, yet 
warlike peal of that voice, fit either to rule a host in the battle- 
field or be raised to God in prayer, were irresistible. At the old 
man’s word and outstretched arm, the roll of the drum was hushed 
at once, and the advancing line stood still. A tremulous enthu- 
siasm seized upon the multitude. That stately form, combining 
the leader and the saint, so gray, so dimly seen, in such an ancient 
garb, could only belong to some old champion of the righteous 
cause, whom the oppressor’s drum had summoned from his grave. 
They raised a shout of awe and exultation, and looked for the 
deliverance of New England. 
The Governor, and the gentlemen of his party, perceiving 
themselves brought to an unexpected stand, rode hastily forward, 
as if they would have pressed their snorting and affrighted horses 
right against the hoary apparition. He, however, blenched not a 
step, but glancing his severe eye round the group, which half 
encompassed him, at last bent it sternly on Sir Edmund Andros. 
One would have thought that the dark old man was chief ruler 
there, and that the Governor and Council, with soldiers at their 
back, representing the whole power and authority of the Crown, 
had no alternative but obedience. 
“What does this old fellow here?” cried Edward Randolph, 
iercely. “On, Sir Edmund! Bid the soldiers forward, and give 
he dotard the same choice that you give all his countrymen—to 
tand aside or be trampled on!” 
“Nay, nay, let us show respect to the good grandsire,” said 
sullivant, laughing. “See you not, he is some old roundheaded 
lignitary, who hath lain asleep “hese thirty years, and knows

  nothing of the change of times? Doubtless, he thinks to put us 
down with a proclamation in Old Noll’s name!” 
“Are you mad, old man?” demanded Sir Edmund 
loud and harsh tones. “How dare you stay the mar 
James’s Governor?” 
“T have stayed the march of a king himself, ere no

longer a tyrant on the throne of England, and by tomorrow 
noon his name shall be a byword in this very street, where 
ye would make it a word of terror. Back, thou that wast a Gov- 
ernor, back! With this night thy power is ended—tomorrow, the 
prison!—back, lest I foretell the scaffold!” 
The people had been drawing nearer and nearer, and drinking 
in the words of their champion, who spoke in accents long dis- 
used, like one unaccustomed to converse, except with the dead 
of many years ago. But his voice stirred their souls. They con- 
fronted the soldiers, not wholly without arms, and ready to con- 
vert the very stones of the street into deadly weapons. Sir 
Edmund Andros looked at the old man; then he cast his hard and 
cruel eye over the multitude, and beheld them burning with that 
lurid wrath, so difficult to kindle or to quench; and again he’ fixed 
his gaze on the aged form, which stood obscurely in an open space, 
where neither friend nor foe had thrust himself. What were his 
thoughts, he uttered no word which might discover. But whether 
the oppressor were overawed by the Gray Champion’s look, or 
perceived his peril in the threatening attitude of the people, it is 
certain that he gave back, and ordered his soldiers to commence 
a slow and guarded retreat. Before another sunset, the Governor, 
and all that rode so proudly with him, were prisoners, and long 
ere it was known that James had abdicated, King William was 
proclaimed throughout New England. 
‘But where was the Gray Champion? Some reported 
when the troops had gone from King Street, and the people wav

thronging tumultuously in their rear, Bradstreet, the aged Gov- 
ernor, was seen to embrace a form more aged than his own. Others 
soberly affirmed, that while they marveled at the venerable 
grandeur of his aspect, the old man had faded from their eyes, 
melting slowly into the hues of twilight, till, where he stood, there 
was an empty space. But all agreed that the hoary shape was 
gone. The men of that generation watched for his reappearance, 
in sunshine and in twilight, but never saw him more, nor knew 
when his funeral passed, nor where his gravestone was. _ 
And who was the Gray Champion? Perhaps his name might 
be found in the records of that stern Court of Justice which 
passed a sentence, too mighty for the age, but glorious in all after 
times, for its humbling lesson to the monarch and its high example 
to the subject. I have heard, that whenever the descendants of 
the Puritans are to show the spirit of their sires, the old man 
appears again. When eighty years had passed, he walked once 
more in King Street. Five years later, in the twilight of an April 
morning, he stood on the green, beside the meeting-house, at Lex- 
ington, where now the obelisk of granite, with a slab of slate 
inlaid, commemorates the first. fallen of the Revolution. And 
when our fathers were toiling at the breastwork on Bunker’s Hill, 
all through that night the old warrior walked his rounds. Long, 
long may it be, ere he comes again! His hour is one of darkness, 
and adversity, and peril. But should domestic tyranny oppress 
us, or the invader’s step pollute our soil, still may the Gray 
Champion come, for he is the type of New England’s hereditary 
spirit, and his shadowy march, on the eve of danger, must ever 
be the pledge that New England’s sons will vindicate their

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Historical Note. A tradition handed down from the time of King 
Philip’s war gave Hawthorne the suggestion for this story. In the attack 
made upon the village of Hadley, Massachusetts, by the Indians in 1675 a 
venerable man, of stately form, and with flowing white beard, suddenly 
appeared among the panic-stricken villagers, took command, and helped 
them put the savages to flight. Then he disappeared as suddenly as he 
had come. In their wonder, not knewing where he had come from or

where he had gone, many believed he had been sent from Heaven to 
deliver them. 
Their defender was William Goffe, who had been an officer in Crom- 
well’s army, and a member of the court which condemned Charles I to 
death. (Read the reference to this court in the story.) He was a Puritan, 
a man of deep religious feeling, whose acts had been governed by the 
desire to secure his countrymen their liberties. When Charles II suc- 
ceeded to the English throne, Goffe fied to New England to escape his 
vengeance. Officers were sent across the ocean in pursuit of him. For 
this reason he lived in hiding, his name and identity being known only 
to friends who aided and protected him. He had many narrow escapes. 
but was never captured. From his hiding place he had seen the Indians 
stealing upon the people of Hadley and had gone forth to battle against 
them. After living in exile for the rest of his life, he died about 1679. 
In this story Hawthorne altered facts to suit his purpose, making the 
Gray Champion appear at the time of the Boston Insurrection, in 1689. 
In this year James II, who had succeeded his brother, Charles II, was 
dethroned, and fled from his kingdom, and his son-in-law, William III, 
Prince of Orange, was made King of England. 
_ The Gray Champion is made to typify the Spirit of Liberty—that 
spirit which animated Goffe as a Puritan soldier under Cromwell and which 
sent the Pilgrims and Puritans forth to find a home in the New World.

moment to this country. For my own part, I consider it as noth- 
ing less than a question of freedom or slavery; and in proportion 
to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the 
debate. It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth, 
and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to God and our 
country. Should I keep back my opinions at such a time, through 
fear of giving offense, I should consider myself as guilty of treason 
toward my country, and of an act of disloyalty toward the 
Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings. 
Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions 
of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and 
listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts. 
Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous strug- 
gle for liberty? Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, 
having eyes, see not, and having ears, hear not, the things which 
so nearly concern their temporal salvation? For my part, what- 
ever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole 
truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it. 
T have but one lamp by which my feet are guided; and that is 
the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging of the future 
but by the past. And judging by the past, I wish to know what 
there has been in the conduct of the British Ministry for the last 
ten years to justify those hopes with which.gentlemen have been 
pleased to solace themselves and the House? Is it that insidious 
smile with which our petition has been lately received? Trust it 
not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet. Suffer not yourselves 
to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves how this gracious 
reception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations 
which cover our waters and darken our land. Are fleets and 
armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation? Have we 
shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be 
ealled in te win back our love? Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. 
These are the implements of war and subjugation—the last argu- 
ments to which kings resort. I ask, sir, what means this martial 
array, if its purpose be not to force us to submission? Can gentle- 
men assign any other possible motive for it? Has Great Britain 
any enemy, in this quarter of the world, to call for all this accumu-

lation of navies and armies? No, sir, she has none. They are 
meant for us; they can be meant for no other. They are sent over 
to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British Ministry 
have been so long forging. And what have we to oppose to them? 
& Shall we try argument? Sir, we have been trying that for the last 
ten years. Have we anything new to offer upon the subject? 
Nothing. We have held the subject up in every light of which it 
is capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to entreaty 
and humble supplication? What terms shall we find, which have 
to not been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, sir, 
deceive ourselves longer. Sir, we have done everything that could 
be done to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have 
petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have 
prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its 
25 interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the Ministry and 
Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances 
have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications 
have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, 
from the foot of the throne! In vain, after these things, may we 
20 indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no 
longer any room for hope. If we wish to be free—if we mean to 
preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have 
been so long contending—if we mean not basely to abandon the 
noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which 
we have pledged ourselves never to abandon, until the glorious 
object of our contest shall be attained—we must fight! I repeat 
it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to arms and to the God of Hosts 
is all that is left us! . 
They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so 
30 formidable an:adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will 
it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are 
totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in 
every house? Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inac- 
tion? Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying 
a8 supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope 
until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot?

which the God of nature hath placed in our power.. Three millions | 
of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country 
as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our 
enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our 
battles alone. There is a just God who presides over the destinies 
of nations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for 
us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, 
the active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have no election. If we 
were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the 
contest. There-is no retreat but in submission and slavery! Our 
chains are forged! Their clanking may be heard on the plains 
of Boston! The war is inevitable—and let it come! I repeat it, 
sir, let it come! . 
It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, 
Peace, peace!—but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! 
The next gale that sweeps from the north will brmg to our ears 
the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the 
field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? 
What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to 
be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Al- 
mighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for 
me, give me liberty or give me death! 
NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Historical Note. Patrick Henry (1736-1799) delivered this speech at 
the Virginia Convention, March 28, 1775. For some years this fiery young 
orator had been active in Virginia in stirring up resistance to the tyrannical 
acts of the King. In 1774 the royal governor in that colony reported that 
every county was arming a company of men for the purpose of protecting 
their committees, which had been formed, as in the other colonies, to work 
out a plan of codperation against the British government. In March, 1775, 
the second revolutionary convention of Virginia met at Richmond. A reso- 
lution was offered to put the colony into a state of defense. Some delegates 
objected to such radical action, and it is to these men that Henry addressed 
the opening sentences of his speech. 
- The resolution was adopted. The chief command of the Virginia 
forces was offered to Colonel. Washington, who accepted with the words, 
“It is my full intention to devote my life and fortune to the cause in which 
we are engaged.”

GEORGE WASHINGTON TO HIS WIFE 
Philadelphia, 18 June, 1775 
My Dearest: 
I am now set down to write to you on a subject 
which fills me with inexpressible concern, and this concern is 
greatly aggravated and increased when I reflect upon the uneasi- 
ness I know it will give you. It has been determined in Congress 
5 that the whole army raised for the defense of the American cause 
shall be put under my care, and that it is necessary for me to 
proceed immediately to Boston to take upon me the command 
of it. : 
«You may believe me, my dear Patsy, when I assure you, in 
10 the most solemn manner, that, so far from seeking this appoint- 
ment, I have used every endeavor in my power to avoid it, not 
only from my unwillingness to part with you and the family, but 
from a consciousness of its being a trust too great for my capac- 
ity, and that I should enjoy more real happiness in one month

with you at home, than I have the most distant prospect of find- 
ing abroad, if my stay were to be seven times seven years. But 
as it has been a kind of destiny that has thrown me upon this 
service, I shall hope that my undertaking it is designed to answer 
5 some good purpose. You might, and J suppose did perceive, from 
the tenor of my letters, that I was apprehensive I could not avoid 
this appointment, as I did not pretend to intimate when I should 
return. That was the case. It was utterly out of my power to 
refuse this appointment, without exposing my character to such 
1 censures as would have reflected dishonor upon myself and given 
pain to my friends. This, I am sure, could not, and ought not, 
to be pleasing to you, and must have lessened me considerably in 
my own esteem. I shall rely, therefore, confidently on that Provi- 
dence which has heretofore preserved and been bountiful to me, 
1s not doubting but that I shall return safe to you im the fall. I shall 
feel no pain from the toil or the danger of the campaign; my un- 
happiness ‘will flow from the uneasiness I know you will feel from 
being left alone. I therefore beg that you will summon your 
whole fortitude and pass your time as agreeably as possible. 
20 Nothing will give me so much sincere satisfaction as to hear this, 
and to hear it from your own pen. My earnest and ardent desire 
is that you would pursue any plan that is most likely to produce 
content and a tolerable degree of tranquillity; as it must add 
greatly to my uneasy feelings to‘hear that you are dissatisfied or 
% complaining at what I really could not avoid. 
As life is always uncertain and common prudence dictates to 
every man the necessity of settling his temporal concerns while 
it is in his power, and while the mind is calm and undisturbed, I 
have, since I came to this place (for I had not time to do it before 
x0 I left home), got Colonel Pendleton to draft a will for me, by 
the directions I gave him, which will I now enclose.. The provision 
made for you in case of my death will, I hope, ‘be agreeable. 
T shall add nothing more, as I have several letters to write, but 
to desire that you will remember me to your friends, and to assure 
35 you that I am with the most unfeigned regard, my dear Patsy, 
your affectionate, &c.

  NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
‘Historical Note. George Washington (1732-1799) came from. Virginia 
to attend the second meeting of the Continental Congress held in Phila- 
delphia May 10, 1775. He was at that time commander of the militia of 
Virginia and sat in Congress in his colonel’s uniform. In the name of “The 
United Colonies” the Congress voted to authorize the enlistment of troops, 
to build and garrison forts, and to issue notes to the amount of three mil- 
~ lion dollars, the original “Liberty Loan” in America, There was an army 
‘of about ten thousand men encamped around Boston and these Congress 
adopted as “The Continental Army.” John Adams rose in his place and 
proposed the name of the Virginian, George Washington, to be commander- 
in-chief of this New England army. “The gentleman,” he said, “is among 
us and is very well known to us all; a gentleman whose skill and expe- 
wience as an officer, whose independent fortune, great talents, and excel- 
lent universal character would command the approbation of all America, 
and unite the cordial exertions of all the colonies better than any other 
person in-the Union.” The pay of the commander-in-chief was fixed at 
five hundred dollars a month and on June 15 Washington received the 
‘unanimous vote for this all-important office. His lofty stature, exceeding 
six feet, his grave and handsome face, his noble bearing and courtly grace 
‘of manner all proclaimed him worthy of the honor. In a brief speech 
expressive of his high sense of the honor conferred upon him, he said, 
“T beg it may be remembered by every gentleman in this room, that I this 
day declare, with the utmost sincerity, that I do not think myself equal to 
the command I am honored with. As to pay, I beg leave to assure the 
‘Congress that, as no pecuniary consideration could have tempted me to 
accept this arduous employment, at the expense of my domestic ease and 
happiness, I do not wish to make any profit of it. I will keep an exact 
account of my expenses. Those, I doubt not, they will discharge; and that 
is all I desire.” 
As there was no time for a visit to his home, Mt. Vernon, on the 
Potomac River, Washington was obliged to give his wife this important 
information by letter. (In 1759 Washington had married Mrs. Martha 
‘Custis, the widow of one of the wealthiest planters in the Virginia Colony. 
She had two beautiful children at the time of her marriage, but when 
Washington went north to Philadelphia Mrs. Washington was quite alone, 
for her son was away from home and her daughter had died a few years 
before.) Later in the year Mrs. Washington went north and spent the 
winter with her husband at Craigie house, the army headquarters in 
Cambridge. .

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Historical Note. This letter was addressed to George Clinton, gov- 
ernor of New York from 1777-1795. Washington appealed to Clinton 
because of the abilities and resources of New York and also because the 
governor’s zeal as a patriot was well known. At the same time Wash- 
ington addressed a similar letter to the inhabitants of New Jersey, Penn- 
sylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, urging the farmers to provide 
cattle for the use of the army. He assures them of a bountiful price as 
well as the knowledge that they have rendered most essential service to 
the illustrious cause of their country. 
Discussion. 1. Read in your history text what is said about the winter 
of 1777-1778 at Valley Forge. 2. How do the methods of conserving food 
for the army in Washington’s time compare with those of our own time? 
3. How does Washington hope to avert a terrible crisis? 4. Pronounce the 
following: incomparable; catastrophe; adequate; precarious.

  SONG OF MARION’S MEN 
WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT 
Our band is few, but true and tried, 
Our leader frank and bold; 
The British soldier trembles 
When Marion’s name is told. 
Our fortress is the good greenwood, 
Our tent the cypress-tree; 
We know the forest round us, 
As seamen know the sea. 
We know its walls of thorny vines, 
Its glades of reedy grass, 
Its safe and silent islands 
Within the dark morass. ~ 
‘Woe to the English soldiery 
That little dread us near! 
On them shall light at midnight 
A strange and sudden fear; 
When waking to their tents on fire 
They grasp their arms in vain, 
And they who stand to face us 
Are beat to earth again; . 
And they who fly in terror deem 
A mighty host behind, 
And hear the tramp of thousands 
Upon the hollow wind. 
Then sweet the hour that brings release 
From danger and from toil; 
We talk the battle over, 
And share the battle’s spoil.

The woodland rings with laugh and shout, 
As if a hunt were up, 
And woodland flowers are gathered 
To crown the soldier’s cup. 
With merry songs we mock the wind 
That in the pine-top grieves, 
And slumber long and sweetly, 
On beds of oaken leaves. 
Well knows the fair and friendly moon 
The band that Marion leads— 
The glitter of their rifles, 
The scampering of their steeds. 
’Tis life our fiery barbs to guide 
Across the moonlight plains; 
Tis life to feel the night-wind 
That lifts their tossing manes, 
A moment in the British camp— 
A moment—and away 
Back to the pathless forest, 
Before the peep of day. 
Grave men there are by broad Santee, 
Grave men with hoary hairs, 
Their hearts are all with Marion, 
For Marion are their prayers. 
And lovely ladies greet our band, 
With kindliest welcoming, 
With smiles like those of summer, 
And tears like those of spring. 
For them we wear these trusty arms, 
And lay them down no more 
Till we have driven the Briton, 
Forever, from our shore.

Historical Note.. General Francis Marion was a general of the Revo- 
lutionary period. He was a leader of a band of men who worried the 
victorious British troops in the Carolinas in 1780 and 1781 and assisted in- 
driving Cornwallis north, where he surrendered at Yorktown in 1781. Ma-

TIMES THAT TRY MEN’S SOULS 
THOMAS PAINE 
These are the times that try men’s souls. The summer soldier 
and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service - 
of his country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and 
thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily con- 
quered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the 
conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too 
cheap, we esteem too lightly; ’tis dearness only that gives every- 
thing its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon 
its goods; it would be strange indeed, if so celestial an article as
-P-A-G-E-415

freedom should not be highly rated. Britain, with an army to 
enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right, not only 
to tax, but to “bind us in all cases whatsoever,” and if being 
bound in that manner is not slavery, then is there not such a 
thing as slavery upon earth. Even the expression is impious, for 
so unlimited a power can belong only to God. 
I have as little superstition in me as any man living, but my 
secret opinion has been, and still is, that God Almighty will not 
give up a people to military destruction, or leave them unsup- 
portedly to perish, who have so earnestly and so repeatedly 
sought to avoid the calamities of war, by every decent method 
which wisdom could invent. : 
T once felt all that kind of anger, which a man ought to feel, 
against the mean principles that are held by the tories: a noted 
one, who kept a tavern at Amboy, was standing at his door, with 
as pretty a child in his hand, about eight or nine years old, as I 
ever saw, and after speaking his mind as freely as he thought 
was prudent, finished with this unfatherly expression, “Well! 
give me peace in my day.” Not a man lives on the continent but 
fully believes that a separation must some time or other finally 
take place, and a generous parent should have said, “If there 
must be trouble, let it be in my day, that my child may have 
peace”; and his single reflection, well applied, is sufficient to 
awaken every man to duty. Not a place upon earth might be 
so happy as America. Her situation is remote from all the 
wrangling world, and she has nothing to do but to trade with 
them. A man can distinguish in himself between temper and 
principle, and I am as confident, as I am that God governs the 
world, that America will never be happy till she gets clear of 
foreign dominion. Wars, without ceasing, will break out till 
that period arrives, and the continent must in the end be con- 
queror; for though the flame of liberty may sometimes cease to 
shine, the coal can never expire. 
The heart that feels not now, is dead; the blood of his children 
will curse his cowardice, who shrinks back at a time when a little 
might have saved the whole, and made them happy. I love the 
man that can smile in trouble, that can gather strength from

  distress, and grow brave by reflection. "Tis the business of little 
minds to shrink; but he whose heart is firm, and whose conscience 
approves his conduct, will pursue his principles unto death.. My 
own line of reasoning is to myself as straight and. clear as a ray 
of light. Not all the treasures of the world, so far as I believe, 
could have induced me to support an offensive war, for I think it 
murder; but if a thief breaks into my house, burns and destroys 
my property, and kills or threatens to kill me, or those that are 
in it, and to “bind me in all cases whatsoever” to his absolute 
will, am I to suffer it? What signifies it to me, whether. he who 
does it is a king or a common man; my countryman or not my 
countryman; whether it be done by an individual villain, or an 
army of them? If we reason to the root of things we shall find | 
no difference; neither can any just cause be assigned why we 
should punish in the one case and pardon in the other. 
NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Historical Note. Thomas Paine (1737-1809), an interesting figure of 
the Revolutionary period, did much by his writings to help win the war. 
Franklin on: one occasion said, “Where liberty is, there is my home.” 
Whereupon Paine answered, “Where liberty is not, there is my home.” 
He came to America from England in 1774 and fought for America’s free- 
dom as a volunteer under Washington. After the Revolution he went to 
France, where again he fought for liberty in the French Revolution. 
This selection is from a pamphlet called “The Crisis,” published in 
1776 by Paine. Washington had lost the battle of Long Island and had 
been compelled to retreat from New York toward Philadelphia. In Phila- 
delphia there were many royalists who hoped that England would win the 
war. Washington’s soldiers, who had enlisted for short terms, were encour- 
aged to desert or to resign at the end of their terms. The situation was 
serious. 
Washington ordered that “The Crisis” be read before every company 
of soldiers in his army.

LITERATURE AND LIFE IN THE 
HOMELAND 
INTRODUCTION 
It is a hard thing to picture to ourselves our Homeland. 
Is America just a lot of cities and towns and farms, or a collec- 
tion of so many thousands of square miles of prairies and moun- 
tains, the sort of thing one would see from an airplane if one could 
get up high enough and had good enough eyes? Or is it a collec- 
tion of states with queer boundary lines that look plainer on a map 
than they do when we cross them in the train? There are people 
who try to find America in some. motto or symbol. One of our 
great cities has for its motto the words “I will,” and the people 
who live in that city like to think that the enterprise by which 
they build great industries and give work: to great numbers of 
people is the expression of their Americanism. .And some people 
see in the Statue of Liberty in the New York harbor, a statue’ 
holding aloft. a blazing torch to give light to all people, the 
symbol that best expresses the spirit of America. 
Both the motto and the statue help us to see our country as 
something more than a part of a book called “Geography” 
+ “History.” Both of them express what America had always 
been to its citizens and what it became to the world in 1917. 
We did not desire to enter the war, but when it became necessary 
to dé so no true American hesitated. There were great difficulties: 
an army to-raise and equip and train so that it could meet an 
army that had been preparing for forty years to fight the world; 
an army to be transported over three thousand miles of water, a 
terrific task even in normal] times, but made a hundred-fold harder 
because of the monsters that lurked under the sea waiting a 
chance to send a transport to the bottom. And once across, there 
were docks and railroads to be built and a great industrial organ- 
ization to be set going. But the will of America was triumphant 
and the job was done. And the statue, like the “I will,” is a 
symbol of the spirit in America that has helped the spirit of 
liberty throughout the world, so that we now know the day is

coming when all peoples, everywhere, shall be free. We can 
make a beginning, therefore, in our effort to form a picture of 
ywhat America means, by thinking of this Statue of Liberty and 
of these words of high purpose, “T will.” 
But we must fill in the picture. No statue will do, for it, 
after all, is lifeless. No motto will do, for it is only a phrase, 
an inscription. A photograph on which you have written a date 
or the record of a happy meeting with your friend, is very inter- 
esting indeed, and helps you to call to mind your friend. But 
in reality the photograph merely suggests to you your friend 
and your happy times together. Your friend has many moods, 
now sad, now gay. Your friend looks different at different times. 
The history of your friendship has many events in it, and all 
these go together, a thousand details, to make up your own idea 
“this is my friend.” So it is with America. History and legend, 
the knowledge of past events, must acquaint us with our country 
as with our friend. Infinite variety of mood she has, now 
stern and grave like her mountains, now placid like her vast 
expanse of prairie or her waving fields of grain; now laughing 
like the waters in the sunlight, or beautiful in anger as mighty 
storms sweep hill and plain. And infinite, again, are her activi- 
ties—great factories and mills, lofty office buildings filled with 
workers, trains speeding like mighty shuttles through vast dis- 
tances, farms filled with growing food for a. world. All these 
you must bring into your picture, and more, for infinite, also, 
are the ideals and hopes that go to make up this many-sided 
personality that we name Our Country. 
The selections that follow will help you to make this picture 
that is to be more to us than a’statue or a photograph. Some 
of them are little views, snapshots of our nation’s childhood. 
Others are pictures of various moods or appearances of the later 
America, Some show the spirit of laughter in America; others 
give some of the songs of America; and at the end are a few 
pictures of America at work. All will help, but they are only 
an imperfect and brief introduction to a subject that is’ going 
* to interest you all through your life: What is America to me, 
and what can I do to make her happy?

EARLY AMERICA - 
  o THE CHARACTER OF COLUMBUS 
ARCHBISHOP CORRIGAN 
To us it is given to behold in its full splendor what Columbus. 
like another Moses on the borders of the Land of Promise, could 
only discern in dim and distant outlines. And, therefore, with 
Italy, the land of his birth; with Spain, the land of his adoption; 
with the other nations of the globe who are debtors to his daring. 
we gladly swell the universal chorus in his honor of praise and of 
thanksgiving. 
In 1792 the ocean separated us by a journey of seventy days 
from Europe; our self-government was looked upon as a problem 
still to be solved; at home, facilities of travel and of intercom- 
munication were yet to be provided. More than this, the un- 
worthy innuendoes, the base as well as baseless charges that 
sought to tarnish the fair fame of Columbus, had not been re- 
moved by. patient historical research and critical acumen. For- 
tunately, these clouds that gathered around the exploits of the 
great discoverer have been almost entirely dispelled, thanks 
especially to the initiative of a son of our Empire: State, the 
immortal Washington Irving. 
I beg to present Columbus as a man of science and a man of

  faith: As a scientist, considering the time in which he lived, he 
eminently deserves our respect. Both im theory and in practice 
he was one of the best geographers and cosmographers of the age. 
According to reliable historians, before he set out to discover new 
seas, he had navigated the whole extent of those already known. 
Moreover, he had studied so many authors and to such advantage 
that Alexander von Humboldt affirmed: “When we consider his 
life we must feel astonishment at the extent of his literary 
acquaintance.” 
- Columbus took nothing for granted. While he bowed rever- 
ently to the teachings of his faith, he brushed away as cobwebs 
certain interpretations of Scripture more fanciful than real, and 
calmly maintained that the Word «of God cannot be in conflict 
with scientific truth. The project of bearing Christ over the 
waters sank deeply into his heart. Time and again he alludes te 
it as the main object of his researches and the aim of his labors 
Other motives of action undoubtedly he had, but they were a 
means to an end. 
Moreover, may we not reasonably assume that the great navi- 
gator, after all, was a willing instrument in the hands of God? 
The old order was changing. Three great inventions, already 
beginning to exert a most potent influence, were destined to revo- 
lutionize the world—the printing-press, which led to the revival 
of learning; the use of gun-powder, which changed the methods of 
warfare; the mariner’s compass, which permitted the sailor to 
tempt boldly even unknown seas. 
These three great factors of civilization, each in its own way, 
so stimulated human thought that the discovery of America was 
plainly in the designs of that Providence which “reacheth from 
end to end mightily and ordereth all things sweetly.”

It is to be regretted that those early writers, who treated of the 
discovery and settlement of America, have not given us more par- 
ticular and candid accounts of the remarkable characters. that 
flourished in savage life. The scanty anecdotes which have 
5 reached us are full of peculiarity and interest; they furnish us with 
nearer glimpses of human nature, and show what man is in a com- 
paratively primitive state, and what he owes to civilization. 
| There is something of the charm of discovery in lighting upon   
these wild and unexplored tracts of human nature; in witnessing, 
0 as it were, the native growth of moral sentiment, and perceiving 
' those generous and romantic qualities which have been artificially

tude magnificence. 
j In civilized life, where the happiness, and indeed almost the 
| existence, of man depends so much upon the opinion of his fellow- 
men, he is constantly acting a studied part. The bold and peculiar 
traits of native character are refined away, or softened down by 
the leveling influence of what is termed good-breeding; and he 
practices so many petty deceptions, and affects so many generous 
sentiments, for the purposes of popularity, that it is difficult to 
distinguish his real from his artificial character. The Indian, on —

ber, and that number rapidly perishing away through sickness 
and hardships; surrounded by a howling wilderness and savage 
tribes; exposed to the rigors of an almost arctic winter, and the 
vicissitudes of. an ever-shifting climate; their minds were filled 
with doleful forebodings, and nothing preserved them from sink- 
ing into despondency but the strong excitement of religious enthu- 
siasm. In this forlorn situation they were visited by Massasoit, 
chief Sagamore of the Wampanoags, a powerful chief, who reigned 
| over a great extent of country. Instead of taking advantage of 
the scanty number of the strangers, and expelling them from his 
| territories, into which they had intruded, he seemed at once to 
conceive for them a generous friendship, and extended toward 
them the rites of primitive hospitality. He came early in the 
spring to their settlement of New Plymouth, attended by a mere 
handful of followers, entered into a solemn Teague of peace and 
amity; sold them a portion of the soil, and promised to secure for 
them the good-will of his savage allies: Whatever may be said of 
Indian perfidy, it is certain that the integrity and good faith of 
Massasoit have never been impeached. He continued a firm and 
magnanimous friend of the white men; suffering them to extend

betraying no jealousy of their increasing power and prosperity. 
Shortly before his death he came once more to New Plymouth, 
with his son Alexander, for the purpose of renewing the covenant 
of peace, and of securing it to his posterity. 
At this conference he endeavored to protect the religion of his 
forefathers from the encroaching zeal of the missionaries; and 
stipulated that no further attempt should be made to draw off his 
people from their ancient faith; but, finding the English ob- 
stinately opposed to any such condition, he mildly relinquished 
the demand. Almost the last act of his life was to bring his two 
sons, Alexander and Philip (as they had been named by the Eng- 
lish), to the residence of a principal settler, recommending mutual 
kindness and confidence; and entreating that the same love and 
5 amity which had existed between the white men and himself 
might be continued afterwards with his children. The good old 
Sachem died in peace, and was happily gathered to his fathers

tories slipping from their hands, and their tribes becoming feeble, 
scattered, and dependent. It may be said that the soil was origi- 
nally purchased by the settlers; but who does not know the nature 
of Indian purchases, in the early periods of colonization? The 
+ Europeans always made thrifty bargains through their superior 
adroitness in traffic; and they gained vast accessions of territory 
by easily provoked hostilities. An uncultivated savage is never a 
nice inquirer into the refinements of law, by which an injury may 
be gradually and legally inflicted. Leading facts are all by which 
jo he judges; and it was enough for Philip to know that before the 
intrusion of the Europeans his countrymen were lords of the soil, 
and that now they were becoming vagabonds in the land of their 
| fathers. 
But whatever may have been his feelings of general hostility, 
5» and his particular indignation at the treatment of his brother, he 
suppressed them for the present, renewed the contract with the 
| settlers, and resided peaceably for many years at Pokanoket, or, 
| as it was called by the English, Mount Hope, the ancient seat of 
dominion of his tribe. Suspicions, however, which were at first 
but vague and indefinite, began to acquire form and substance; 
and he was at length charged with attempting to instigate the 
'| various Eastern tribes to rise at once, and, by a simultaneous 
effort, to throw off the yoke of their oppressors. It is difficult at 
| 
    this distant period to assign the proper credit due to these early 
accusations against the Indians. There was a proneness to suspi- 
cion, and an aptness to acts of violence, on the part of the whites, 
that gave weight and importance to every idle tale. Informers 
abounded where talebearing met with countenance and reward; 
and the sword was readily unsheathed when its success was cer- 
20 tain, and it carved out empire. 
The only positive evidence on record against Philip is the 
accusation of one Sausaman, a renegado Indian, whose natural 
cunning had been quickened by a partial education which he had 
received among the settlers. He changed his faith and his alle- 
»/38 giance two or three times, with a facility that evinced the loose- 
ness of his principles. He had acted for some time as Philip’s

  signal for open hostilities; the Indians pressed to revenge the 
death of their comrade, and the alarm of war resounded through 
the Plymouth colony. 
In the early chronicles of these dark and melancholy times we 
meet with many indications of the diseased state of the public 
mind. The gloom of religious abstraction, and the wildness of 
their situation, among trackless forests and savage tribes, had 
disposed the colonists to superstitious fancies, and had filled their 
imaginations with the frightful chimeras of witchcraft and spec- 
trology. They were much given also to a belief in omens. The 
troubles with Philip and his Indians were preceded, we are told, 
by a variety of those awful warnings which forerun great and 
public calamities. The perfect form of an Indian bow appeared 
in the air at New Plymouth, which-was looked upon by the inhab- 
itants as a “prodigious apparition.” At. Hadley, Northampton, 
and other towns in their neighborhood, “was heard the report of a 
great piece of ordnance, with a shaking of the earth and a con- 
siderable echo.” Others were alarmed on a-still, sunshiny morn-. 
ing, by the discharge of guns and muskets; bullets seemed to 
whistle past them, and the noise of drums resounded in the air, 
seeming to pass away to the westward; others fancied that they 
heard the galloping of horses over their heads; and certain mon- 
strous births, which took place about the time, filled the super- 
stitious in some towns with doleful forebodings. Many of these 
portentous sights and sounds may be ascribed to natural phe- 
nomena: to the northern lights which occur vividly in those lati- 
tudes; the meteors which explede in the air; the casual rushing 
of a blast through the top branches of the forest; the crash of 
fallen trees or disrupted rocks; and to those other uncouth sounds 
and echoes which will sometimes strike the ear so strangely amidst 
the profound stillness of woodland solitudes. These may have 
startled some melancholy imaginations, may have been exag- 
gerated by the love of the marvelous, and listened to with that 
avidity with which we devour whatever is fearful and mysterious. 
The universal currency of these superstitious fancies, and the 
grave record made of them by one of the learned men of the day, 
are strongly characteristic of the times.

On the part of the whites it was conducted with su

of the natural rights of their antagonists; on the 7:

The events of the war are transmitted to us by

pl AY 
ing ravages, that filled the minds of the colonists with awe and 
apprehension. The report of a distant gun would perhaps be 
heard from the solitary woodlands, where there was known to be 
no white man; the cattle which had been wandering in the woods 
' 5 would sometimes return home wounded; or an Indian or two 
| would be seen lurking about the skirts of the forests, and sud- 
denly disappearing; as the lightning will sometimes be seen play- 
ing silently about the edge of the cloud that is brewing up the 
tempest, 
10 Though sometimes pursued and even surrounded by the sei- 
tlers, yet Philip as often escaped almost miraculously from their 
toils, and, plunging into the wilderness, would be lost. to all search 
or inquiry, until he again emerged at some far distant quarter, 
laying the country desolate. Among his strongholds were the 
great swamps or morasses, which extend in some parts of New 
England; composed of loose bogs of deep black mud; perplexed 
with thickets, brambles, rank weeds, the shattered and molder- 
ing trunks of fallen trees, overshadowed by lugubrious hemlocks. 
The uncertain footing and the tangled maves of these shaggy 
wilds rendered them almost impracticable to the white man, 
though the Indian could thread their labyrinths with the agility 
of a deer. Into one of these, the great swamp of Pocasset Neck, 
was Philip once driven with a band of his followers. The English 
did not dare to pursue him, fearing to venture into these dark and 
frightful recesses, where they might perish in fens and miry pits, 
or be shot down by lurking foes. They therefore invested the 
entrance to the Neck, and began to build a fort, with the thought 
of starving out the foe; but Philip and his warriors wafted them- 
selves on a raft over an arm of the sea, in the dead of the night, 
30 leaving the women and children. behird; and escaped away to the 
westward, kindling the flames of war among the tribes of Massa- 
chusetts and the Nipmuck country, and threatening the colony of 
Connecticut. 
In this way Philip became a theme of universal apprehension. 
% The mystery in which he was enveloped exaggerated his real 
terrors. He was an evil that walked in darkness; whose coming 
none could foresee, and against which none knew when to be on SELL. 1-16 & 8 ~ a

the alert. The whole country abounded with rumors and alarms. 
Philip seemed almost possessed of ubiquity; for, in whatever part 
of the widely-extended frontier an irruption from the forest took 
place, Philip was said to be its leader. Many superstitious no- 
5 tions also were circulated concerning him. He was said to deal 
in necromancy, and to be attended by an old Indian witch or 
prophetess, whom he consulted, and who assisted him by her 
charms and incantations. This indeed was frequently the case 
with Indian chiefs; either through ‘their own credulity, or to act 
x0 upon that of their followers; and the influence of the prophet and 
the dreamer over Indian superstition has been fully evidenced in 
recent instances of savage warfare. 
At the time that Philip effected his escape from Pocasset, his 
fortunes were in a desperate condition. His forces had been 
ws thinned by repeated fights, and he had lost almost the whole of 
his resources. In this time of adversity he found a faithful friend 
in Canonchet, chief Sachem of all the Narragansets. He was the 
son and heir of Miantonimo, the great Sachem, who, as already 
mentioned, after an honorable acquittal of the charge of con- 
20 spiracy, had been privately put to death at the perfidious insti- 
gations of the settlers. “He was the heir,” says the old chron- 
icler, “of all his father’s pride and insolence, as well as of his 
malice toward the English” ;—he certainly was the heir of his 
insults and injuries, and the legitimate avenger of his murder. 
2s Though he had forborne to take an active part in this hopeless 
war, yet he received Philip and his broken forces with open arms; 
and gave them the most generous countenance and support. ‘This 
at once drew upon him the hostility of the English; and it was 
determined to strike a signal blow that should involve both the 
zo Sachems in one common ruin. A great force was, therefore, 
gathered together from Massachusetts, Plymouth, and Connecti- 
cut, and was sent into the Narraganset country in the depth of 
winter, when the swamps, being frozen and leafless, could be 
traversed with comparative facility, and would no longer afford 
3s dark and impenetrable fastnesses to the Indians. 
Apprehensive of attack, Canonchet had conveyed the greater 
part of his stores, together with the old, the infirm, the women
-P-A-G-E-436
  Philip of Pokanoket 419 
  and children of his tribe, to a strong fortress; where he and Philip 
had likewise drawn up the flower of their forces. This fortress, 
deemed by. the Indians impregnable, was situated upon a rising 
mound or kind of island, of five or six acres, in the midst of a 
5 swamp; it was constructed with a degree of judgment and skill 
| vastly superior to what is usually displayed in Indian fortifica- 
tion, and indicative of the martial genius of these two chieftains. 
Guided by a renegado Indian, the English penetrated, through 
December snows, to this stronghold, and came upon the garrison 
0 by surprise. The fight was fierce and tumultuous. The assailants 
were repulsed in their first attack, and several of their bravest 
officers were shot down in the act of storming the fortress sword in 
hand. The assault was renewed with greater success. A lodg- 
ment was effected. The Indians were driven from one post to 
3 another. They disputed their ground inch by inch, fighting with 
the fury of despair. Most of their veterans were cut to pieces; 
and after a long and bloody battle, Philip and Canonchet, with a 
handful of surviving warriors, retreated from the fort, and took 
refuge in the thickets of the surrounding forest. 
The victors set fire to the wigwams and the fort; the whole 
was soon in a blaze; many of the old men, the women, and the 
children perished in the flames. This last outrage overcame even 
the stoicism of the savage. The neighboring woods resounded 
with the yells of rage and despair, uttered by the fugitive war- 
riors, as they beheld the destruction of their dwellings, and heard 
the agonizing cries of their wives and offspring. “The burning of 
the wigwams,” says a contemporary writer, “the shrieks and cries 
of the women and children, and the yelling of the warriors, exhib- 
ited a most horrible and affecting scene, so that it greatly moved 
bo some of the soldiers.” The same writer cautiously adds, “They 
were in much doubt then, and afterwards seriously inquired, s — 
& 
whether burning their enemies alive could be consistent with. 
humanity, and the benevolent principles of the Gospel. 
The fate of the brave and generous Canonchet is worthy of 
% particular mention: the last, scene of his life is one of the noblest 
instances on record of Indian magnanimity. 
Broken down in his power and resources by this signal defeat,
-P-A-G-E-437

yet faithful to his ally, and to the hapless cause which he had 
espoused, he rejected all overtures of peace, offered on condition 
of betraying Philip and his followers, and declared that “he 
would fight it out to the last man, rather than become a servant 
to the English.” His home being destroyed, his country harassed 
and laid waste by the incursions of the conquerors, he was obliged 
to wander away to the banks of the Connecticut; where he formed 
a rallying point to the whole body of western Indians, and laid 
waste several of the English settlements. 
Early in the spring he departed on a hazardous expedition, 
with only thirty chosen men, to penetrate to Seaconck, in the 
vicinity of Mount Hope, and to procure seed corn to plant for 
the sustenance of his troops. This little band of adventurers had 
passed safely through the Pequod country, and were in the center 
of the Narraganset, resting at some wigwams near Pawtucket 
River, when an alarm was given of an approaching enemy. Hav- 
ing but seven men by him at the time, Canonchet dispatched 
two of them to the top of a neighboring hill, to bring intelligence 
of the foe. , 
Panic-struck by the appearance of a troop of English and 
Indians rapidly advancing, they fled in breathless terror past their 
chieftain, without stopping to inform him of the danger. Canon- 
chet sent another scout, who did the same. He then sent two 
more, one of whom, hurrying back in confusion and affright, told 
him that the whole British army was at hand. Canonchet saw 
there was no choice but immediate flight. He attempted to escape 
round the hill, but was perceived and hotly pursued by the hostile 
Indians and a few of the fleetest of the English. Finding the 
swiftest pursuer close upon his heels, he threw off, first his blanket, 
then his silver-laced coat and belt of peag, by which his enemies 
knew him to be Canonchet, and redoubled the eagerness of pursuit. 
At length, in dashing through the river, his foot slipped upon 
a stone, and he fell so deep as to wet his gun. This accident so 
struck him with despair, that, as he afterwards confessed, “his 
heart and his bowels turned within him, and he became like a 
rotten stick, void of strength.” 
To such a degree was he unnerved that, being seized by 4
-P-A-G-E-438
  Philip of Pokanoket 421 
  Pequod Indian within a short distance of the river, he made no 
resistance, though a man of great vigor of body and boldness of 
heart. Buton being made prisoner the whole pride of his spirit 
' arose within him; and from that moment we find, in the anec- 
s dotes given by his enemies, nothing but repeated flashes of ele- © 
vated and prince-like heroism. Being questioned by one of the 
English who first came up with him, and who had not attained 
his twenty-second year, the proud-hearted warrior, looking with 
lofty contempt upon his youthful countenance, replied, “You are 
o a child—you cannot understand matters of war—let your brother 
or your chief come—him will I answer.” 
Though repeated offers were made to him of his life, on condi- 
| tion of submitting with his nation tothe English, yet he rejected 
them with disdain, and refused to send any proposals of the kind 
1s to, the great body of his subjects; saying that he knew none of 
them would comply. Being reproached with his breach of faith 
toward the whites, his boast that he would not deliver up a 
Wampanoag nor the paring of a Wampanoag’s nail, and his threat 
that he would burn the English alive in their houses, he disdained 
20 to justify himself, haughtily answering that others were as for- 
ward for the war as himself, and’ he desired to hear no more 
' thereof. , 
So noble and unshaken a spirit, so true a fidelity to his cause 
and his friend, might have touched the feelings of the generous 
2 and the brave; but Canonchet was an Indian; a being toward 
whom war had no courtesy, humanity no law, religion no com- 
passion—he was condemned to die. , The last words of him that 
are recorded are worthy the greatness of his soul. When sentence 
of death was passed upon him, he observed that he liked it well, 
30 for he should die before his heart was soft, or he had spoken any 
thing unworthy of himself. His enemies gave him the death of 
a soldier, for he was shot at Stoningham, by three young Sachems 
of his own rank. ‘ 
The defeat at the Narraganset fortress, and the death of 
35 Canonchet, were fatal blows to the fortunes of King Philip. He 
made an ineffectual attempt to raise a head of war, by stirring up 
the Mohawks to take arms; but though possessed of the native
-P-A-G-E-439
a » a 2» s 2 Ss 422 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
talents of a statesman, his arts were counteracted by the superior 
arts of his enlightened enemies, and the terror of their warlike 
skill began to subdue the resolution of the neighboring tribes. 
The unfortunate chieftain saw himself daily stripped of power, 
and his ranks rapidly thinning around him. Some were suborned 
by the whites; others fell victims to hunger and fatigue, and to 
the frequent attacks by which they were harassed. His stores 
were all captured; his chosen friends were swept away from before 
his eyes; his uncle was shot down by his side; his sister was car- 
ried into captivity; and in one of his narrow escapes he was com- 
pelled to leave his beloved wife and only son to the mercy of the 
enemy. “His ruin,” says the historian, “being thus gradually 
carried on, his misery was not prevented, but augmented thereby; 
being himself made acquainted with the sense and experimental 
feeling of the captivity of his children, loss of friends, slaughter 
of his subjects, bereavement of all family relations, and being 
stripped of all outward comforts, before his own life should be 
taken away.” 
To fill up the measure of his misfortunes, his own followers 
began to plot against his life, that by sacrificing him they might 
purchase dishonorable safety. Through treachery a number of 
his faithful adherents, the subjects of Wetamoe, an Indian princess 
of Pocasset, a near kinswoman and confederate of Philip, were 
betrayed into the hands of the enemy. Wetamoe was among 
them at the time, and attempted to make her escape by crossing 
a neighboring river; either exhausted by swimming, or starved by 
cold and hunger, she was found dead and naked near the water 
side. . 
However Philip had borne up against the complicated mis- 
eries and misfortunes that surrounded him, the treachery of his 
followers seemed to wring his heart and reduce him to despon- 
dency. It is said that “he never rejoiced afterwards, nor had 
success in any of his designs.’ The spring of hope was broken 
—the ardor of enterprise was extinguished—he looked around, 
and all was danger and darkness; there was no eye to pity, nor 
any arm that could bring deliverance. With a scanty band of 
followers, who still remained true to his desperate fortunes, the
-P-A-G-E-440
  | 80 
| 88 Philip of Pokanoket 423 
unhappy Philip wandered back to the vicinity of Mount Hope, 
the ancient dwelling of his fathers. Here he lurked about, like 
a specter; among the scenes of former power and prosperity, now 
bereft of home, of family, and friend. There needs no better pic- - 
ture of his destitute and piteous situation than that furnished by 
the homely pen of the chronicler, who is unwarily enlisting the 
feelings of the reader in favor of the hapless warrior whom he 
reviles. “Philip,” he says, “like a savage wild beast, having been 
hunted by the English forces through the woods, above a hundred 
miles backward and forward, at last was driven to-his own den 
upon Mount Hope, where he retired, with a few of his best friends, 
into a swamp, which proved but a prison to keep him fast till the 
messengers of death came by divine permission to execute ven- 
geance upon him.” 
Even in this last refuge of desperation and despair, a sullen 
grandeur gathers round his memory. We picture him to our- 
selves seated among his careworn followers, brooding in silence 
over his blasted fortunes, and acquiring a savage sublimity from 
the wildness and dreariness of his lurking-place. Defeated, but 
not dismayed—crushed to the earth, but not humiliated—he 
seemed to grow more haughty beneath disaster, and to experience 
a fierce satisfaction in draining the last dregs of bitterness. Little 
minds are’tamed and subdued by misfortune; but great minds 
rise above it. The very idea of submission awakened the fury of 
Philip, and he smote to death one of his followers, who proposed 
an expedient of peace. The brother of the victim made his escape, 
and in revenge betrayed the retreat of his chieftain. A body of 
white men and Indians were immediately dispatched to the 
swamp where Philip lay crouched, glaring with fury and despair. 
Before he was aware of their approach, they had begun to sur- 
round him. In a little while he saw five of his trustiest followers 
laid dead at his feet; all resistance was vain; he rushed forth from 
his covert, and made a headlong attempt to escape, but was shot 
through thé heart by a renegado Indian of his own nation. 
Such is the scanty story of the brave but unfortunate King 
Philip; persecuted while living, slandered and dishonored when 
dead... If, however, we consider even the prejudiced anecdotes
-P-A-G-E-441

Bi 
23   
424 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
  furnished us by his enemies, we may perceive in them traces of 
amiable and lofty character sufficient to awaken sympathy for 
his fate and respect for his memory. We find that, amidst all the 
harassing cares and ferocious passions of constant warfare, he 
was alive to the softer feelings of connubial love and paternal 
tenderness, and to the generous sentiment of friendship. The 
captivity of his “beloved wife and only son” are mentioned with 
exultation as causing him poignant misery; the death of any near 
friend is triumphantly recorded as a new blow on his sensibilities; 
but the treachery and desertion of many of his followers, in whose 
affections he had confided, is said to have desolated his heart, and 
to have bereaved him of all further comfort. He was a patriot 
attached to his native soil—a prince true to his subjects, and 
indignant of their wrongs—a soldier, daring in battle, firm in 
adversity, patient of fatigue, of hunger, of every variety of bodily 
suffering, and ready to perish in the cause he had espoused. Proud 
of heart, and with an untamable love of natural liberty, he pre- 
ferred to enjoy it among the beasts of the forests or in the dismal 
and famished recesses of swamps and morasses, rather than bow 
his haughty spirit to submission, and live dependent and despised 
in the ease and luxury of the settlements. With heroic qualities 
and bold achievements that would have graced a civilized warrior 
and have rendered him the theme of the poet and the historian, 
he lived a wanderer and, a fugitive in his native land, and went 
down, like a lonely bark foundering amid darkness and tempest 
—without a pitying eye to weep his fall or a friendly hand to 
record his struggle. 
NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Biography. Washington Irving (1783-1859) was born in New York 
City in the very year in which the Treaty of Peace that ended the Revolu- 
tionary War was signed. He was destined to do for American literature 
what the War had already done for the American government and people— 
make it respected among all nations. Irving’s mother said, “Washington’s 
great work‘is done; let us name our boy Washington,” little dreaming 
when thus nam’g him after the Father of his Country that he should one 
day come to be called the “Father of American Letters.”

Philip of Pokanoket , 425 
  On April 30, 1789, when this little boy was six years old, his father took 
him to Federal Hall in Wall Street, to witness Washington’s inauguration 
as the first president of the United States. It is told that President Wash- 
ington laid his hand kindly on the head of his little namesake and gave him 
his blessing. : 
Young Washington Irving led.a happy life, rambling in his boyhood 
about every nook and corner of the city and the adjacent woods, whieh at 
that time were not very far to seek, idling about the busy wharves, making 
occasional trips up the lordly Hudson, roaming, gun in hand, along its banks 
and over the neighboring Kaatskills, listening to the tales of old Dutch 
landlords and gossipy old Dutch housewives. When he became a young man 
he wove these old tales, scenes, experiences, and much more that his imag- 
ination and his merry humor added, into some of the, most rollicking, mirth- 
ful stories that had been read in many a day. The first of these was a 
burlesque History of New York, purporting to have been found among the 
papers of a certain old Dutch burgher by the name of Diedrich Knicker- 
bocker (1809). This may be said to have been his first important work. It 
made him instantly famous, But better than that, it silenced the sneers of 
the English critics who, up to that time, had been asking contemptuously, 
“Who reads an American book?” and set them all to reading and laughing 
over it with the rest of the world. It also showed to Americans as well as 
to foreigners what wealth of literary material this new country already 
possessed in its local legends and history. 
Ten years later, during his residence.in England (1819-20), Irving pub- 
lished The Sketch Book, containing the inimitable “Rip van Winkle” and 
the delightful “Legend of Sleepy Hollow.” This may be said to mark the 
real beginning of American literature. 
A visit to Spain resulted in The Alhambra and The Life of Columbus, 
descriptive and historical works in which Irving won as great success as he 
had attained with his humorous tales. Then followed some years of 
quiet life at his beautiful home, Sunnyside, near Tarrytown on the Hud- 
son, in the midst of the favorite haunts of his boyhood days and the scenes 
which his pen had immortalized. He was not idle, however, for a half-dozen 
works appeared during these stay-at-home years, some of them grow- 
ing out of his travels through’ our then rapidly expanding West. Only 
once more did he Jeave his native shores, when he served as Minister to 
Spain (1842-46). But through all his life he seems to have cherished a 
patriotic reverence for the great American whose name he bore, and now, 
as the crowning work of his ripe old age, he devoted his last years to com- 
pleting his. Life of Washington, the fifth and final volume of which appeared 
but a few months before his death on November 28, 1859. His genial, 
cheerful nature shines through all his works and makes him still, as his 
friend Thackeray said of him in his lifetime, “beloved of all the world.”

  The Courtship of Miles Standish 427 
THE COURTSHIP OF MILES STANDISH 
HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW 
MILES STANDISH 
In the Old Colony days, in Plymouth the land of the Pilgrims, 
To and fro in a room of his simple and primitive dwelling, 
Clad in doublet and hose, and boots of Cordovan leather, 
Strode, with a martial air, Miles Standish the Puritan Captain. 
5 Buried in thought he seemed, with his hands behind him, and 
pausing 
Ever and anon to behold his glittering weapons of warfare, 
Hanging in shining array along the walls of the chamber— 
Cutlass and corselet of steel, and his trusty sword of Damascus, 
Curved at the point and inscribed with its mystical Arabic sen- 
tence, : 
j10 While underneath, in a corner, were fowling-piece, musket, and 
| matchlock. 
' Short of stature he was, but strongly built and athletic, — 
Broad in the shoulders, deep-chested, with muscles and sinews 
of iron; 
Brown as a nut was his face, but his russet beard was already 
Flaked with patches of snow, as hedges sometimes in No- 
vember. . 
1s Near him was seated John Alden, his friend, and household com- 
panion, : 
Writing with diligent speed at a table of pine by the window; 
Fair-haired, azure-eyed, with delicate Saxon complexion, 
Having the dew of his youth, and the beauty thereof, as the cap- 
tives 
Whom Saint Gregory saw, and exclaimed, “Not Angles but 
jl was he of the men who came in the May 
saking the silence, the diligent scribe interrupting,
-P-A-G-E-445
  428 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
Spake, in the pride of his. heart, Miles Standish the Captain of 
Plymouth. 
“Look at these arms,” he said, “the warlike weapons that hang 
here, 
Burnished and bright and clean, as if for parade or inspection! 
This is the sword of. Damascus I fought with in Flanders; this 
breastplate, 
s Well I remember the day! once saved my life in a skirmish; 
Here in front you can see the very dint of the bullet 
Fired point-blank at my heart by a Spanish arcabucero. 
Had it not been of sheer steel, the forgotten bones of Miles 
‘ Standish 
Would at this moment be mold, in their grave in the Flemish 
morasses.” 
1o Thereupon answered John Alden, but looked not up from his 
writing: 
“Truly the breath of the Lord hath slackened the speed of the 
bullet; 
He in his mercy preserved you, to be our shield and our weapon!” 
Still the Captain continued, unheeding the words of the stripling: 
“See, how bright they are burnished, as if im an arsenal hanging; 
1s That is because I have done it myself, and not left it to others. 
Serve yourself, would you be well served, is an excellent adage; 
So I take care of my arms, as you of your pens and your ink- 
horn. 
Then, too, there are my soldiers, my great, invincible army, 
Twelve men, all equipped, having each his rest’ and his matchlock, 
20 Eighteen shillings a month, together with diet and pillage, 
And, like Cesar, I know the name of each of my soldiers!” 
This he said with a smile, that danced in his eyes, as the sunbeams 
Dance on the waves of the sea, and vanish again in a moment. 
Alden laughed as he wrote, and still the Captain continued: 
26 “Took! you can see from this window my brazen howitzer planted 
High on the roof of the church, a preacher who speaks to the 
purpose, 
Steady, straightforward, and strong, with irresistible logic, 
Orthodox, flashing conviction right into the hearts of the heathen.

  The Courtship of Miles Standish . 429 
Now we are ready, I think, for any assault of the Indians; 
Let them come, if they like, and the sooner they try it the better— 
Let them come if they like, be it sagamore, sachem, or pow-wow, 
Aspinet, Samoset, Corbitant, Squante, or Tokamahamon!” 
Long at the window he stood, and wistfully gazed on the land- 
scape, 
Washed with a cold gray mist, the vapory breath of the east wind, 
Forest and meadow and hill, and the steel-blue rim of the ocean, 
Lying silent and sad, in the afternoon shadows and sunshine. 
Over his countenance flitted a shadow like those on the landscape, 
Gloom intermingled with light; and his voice was subdued with 
emotion, 
Tenderness, pity, regret, as after a pause he proceeded: 
“Yonder there, on the hill by the sea, lies buried Rose Standish; 
Beautiful rose of love, that bloomed for me by the wayside! 
She was the first to die of all who came in the May Flower! 
Green above her is growing the field of wheat we have sown there, 
Better to hide from the Indian scouts the graves of our people, 
Lest they shculd count them and see how many already have 
perished!” 
Sadly his face he averted, and strode up and down, and was 
thoughtful. 
Fixed to the opposite wall was a shelf of books, and among them 
29 Prominent three, distinguished alike for bulk and for binding; 
Bariffe’s Artillery Guide, and the Commentaries of Cesar, 
Out of the Latin translated by Arthur Goldinge of London, 
And, as if guarded by these, between them was standing the Bible. 
Musing a moment before them, Miles Standish paused, as if 
doubtful 
Which of the three he should choose for his consolation and com- 
fort, . 
“Thether the wars of the Hebrews, the famous campaigns of the 
Romans, . 
r the Artillery practice, designed for belligerent Christians. 
mally down from its shelf he dragged the ponderous Roman,

Seated himself at the window, and opened the book, and in silence 
Turned o’er the well-worn leaves, where thumb-marks thick on 
the margin, 
Like the trample of feet, proclaimed the battle was hottest. 
Nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the strip- 
ling, 
Busily writing epistles important, to go by the May Flower, 
Ready to sail on the morrow, or next day at latest, God willing! 
Homeward bound with the tidings of all that terrible winter, 
Letters written by Alden, and full of the name of Priscilla, 
Full of the name and the fame of the Puritan maiden Priscilla! 
LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP 
Nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the 
stripling, 
Or an occasional sigh from the laboring heart of the Captain, 
Reading the marvelous words and achievements of Julius Cesar. 
After a while he exclaimed, as he smote with his hands, palm 
downwards, 
Heavily on the page: “A wonderful man was this Cesar! 
You are a writer, and I am a fighter, but here is a fellow 
Who could both write and fight, and in both was equally skillful!” 
Straightway answered and spake John Alden, the comely, the 
youthful: 
“Yes, he was equally skilled, as you say, with his pen and his 
weapons. 
Somewhere have I read, but where I forget, he could dictate 
Seven letters at once, at the same time writing his memoirs.” 
“Truly,” continued the Captain, not heeding or hearing the other, 
“Truly a wonderful man was Caius Julius Cesar! ° 
Better be first, he said, in a little Iberian village, 
Than be second in Rome, and I think he was right when he said it. 
Twice was he married before he was twenty, and many times after; 
Battles five hundred he fought, and a thousand cities he con- 
quered; 
He, too, fought in Flanders, as he himself has recorded; 
Finally he was stabbed by his friend, the orator Brutus!

Now, do you know what he did on a certain occasion in Flanders, 
When the rear-guard of his army retreated, the front giving way 
too, 
And the immortal Twelfth Legion was crowded so closely together 
There was no room for their swords? Why, he seized a shield 
from a soldier, 
Putting himself straight at the head of his troops, and commanded 
the captains, 
Calling on each by his name, to order forward the ensigns; 
Then to widen the ranks, and give more room for their weapons; 
So he won the day, the battle of something-or-other. 
That’s what I always say: if you wish a thing to be well done, 
You must do it yourself, you must not leave it to others!” 
All was silent again; the Captain continued his reading. 
Nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the 
stripling 
Writing epistles important to go next day by the May Flower, 
Filled with the name and the fame of the Puritan maiden Pris- 
cilla; 
Every sentence began or closed with the name of Priscilla, 
Till the treacherous pen, to which he confided the secret, 
Strove to betray it by singing and shouting the name of Priscilla! 
Finally closing his book, with a bang of the ponderous cover, 
Sudden and loud as the sound of a soldier grounding his musket, 
Thus to the young man spake Miles Standish the Captain of © 
Plymouth: 
“When you have finished your work, I have something important 
to tell you. * 
Be not however in haste; I can wait; I shall not be impatient!” 
Straightway Alden replied, as he folded the last of his letters, 
Pushing his papers aside, and giving respectful attention: 
“Speak; for whenever you speak, I am always ready to listen, 
Always ready to hear whatever pertains to Miles Standish.” 
Thereupon answered the Captain, embarrassed, and culling his 
phrases: 
“Tis not good for a man to be alone, say the Scriptures. 
 
-P-A-G-E-449
432, Junior High School Literature, Book One 
  This I have said before, and again and again I repeat it; 
Every hour in the day, I think it, and feel it, and say it. 
Since Rose Standish died, my life has been weary and dreary; 
Sick at heart have I been, beyond the healing of friendship. 
s Oft in my loneiy hours have I thought of the maiden Priscilla. 
She is alone in the world; her father and mother and brother 
Died in the winter together; I saw her going and coming, 
Now to the grave of the dead, and now to the bed of the dying, 
Patient, courageous, and strong, and said to myself, that if ever 
zo There were angels on earth, as there are angels in heaven, 
Two have I seen and known; and the angel whose name is Priscilla 
Holds in my desolate life the place which the other abandoned. 
Long have I cherished the thought, but never have dared to 
reveal it, 
Being a coward in this, though valiant enough for the most part. 
as Go to the damsel Priscilla, the loveliest maiden of Plymouth, 
Say that a blunt old Captain, a man not of words but of actions, 
Offers his hand and his heart, the hand and heart of a soldier. 
Not in these words, you know, but this in short is my meaning; 
Tam a maker of war, and not a maker of phrases. 
20 You, who are bred as a scholar, can say it in elegant language, 
Such as you read in your books of the pleadings and wooings of 
lovers, 
Such as you think best adapted to win the heart of a maiden.” 
When he had spoken, John Alden, the fair-haired, taciturn 
stripling, 
All aghast at his words, surprised, embarrassed, bewildered, 
2s Trying to mask his dismay by treating the subject with lightness, 
Trying to smile, and yet feeling his heart stand still in his bosom, 
Just as a timepiece stops in a house that is stricken by lightning, 
Thus made answer and spake, or rather stammered than 
answered: 
“Such a message as that I am sure I should mangle and mar it; 
30 If yeu would have it well done—I am only repeating your 
maxim— . . 
You must do it yourself, you must not leave it to others!”  
-P-A-G-E-450
The Courtship of Miles Standish 433 
But with the air of a man whom nothing can turn from his purpose, 
Gravely shaking his head, made answer the Captain of Plymouth: 
“Truly the maxim is good, and I do not mean to gainsay it; 
. But we must use it discreetly, and not waste powder for-nothing. 
s Now, as I said before, I was never a maker of phrases. 
I can march up to a fortress and summon the place to surrender, 
But march up to a woman with such a proposal, I dare not. 
I’m not afraid of bullets, nor shot from the mouth of a cannon, 
But of a thundering ‘No!’ point-blank from the mouth of a woman, 
o That I confess I’m afraid of, nor am I ashamed to confess it! 
So you must grant my request, for you are an elegant scholar, 
Having the graces of speech, and skill in the turning of phrases.” 
Taking the hand of his friend, who still was reluctant and 
doubtful, 
Holding it long in his own, and pressing it kindly, he added: 
“Though I have spoken thus lightly, yet deep is the feeling that 
prompts me; 
Surely you cannot refuse what I ask in the name of our friend- 
ship!” 
Then made answer John Alden: “The name of friendship is 
/ sacred ; 
- What you demand in that name, I have not the power to deny 
youl” 
So the strong will prevailed, subduing and molding the gentler, 
Friendship prevailed over love, and Alden went on his errand. a s 
THE LOVER’S ERRAND 
i So the strong will prevailed, and Alden went on his errand, 
Out of the street of the village, and into the paths of the forest, 
, Into the tranquil woods, where bluebirds and robins were building 
Towns in the populous trees, with hanging gardens of verdure, 
25 Peaceful, aerial cities of joy and affection and freedom. 
All around him was calm, but within him commotion and conflict, 
Love contending with friendship, and self with each generous 
\oughts were heaving and dashing, 
every roll of the vessel,
-P-A-G-E-451
  434 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
Washes the bitter sea, the merciless surge of the ocean! 
“Must I relinquish it all,” he cried with a wild lamentation, 
“Must I relinquish it all, the joy, the hope, the illusion?’ 
Was it for this I have loved, and waited, and worshiped in 
silence? 
Was it for this I have followed the flying fleet and the shadow 
Over the wintry sea, to the desolate shores of New England? 
Truly the heart is deceitful, and out of its depths of corruption 
Rise, like an exhalation, the misty phantoms of passion; 
Angels of light they seem, but are only delusions of Satan. 
All is clear to me now; I feel it, I see it distinctly! 
This is the hand of the Lord; it is laid upon me in anger, 
For I have followed too rauch the heart’s desires and devices, 
Worshiping Astaroth blindly, and impious idols of Baal. 
This is the cross I must bear; the sin and the swift retribution.” a

e 
1s So through the Plymouth woods John Alden went on his errand; 
Crossing the brook at the ford, where it brawled over pebble and 
shallow, 
Gathering still, as he went, the May-flowers blooming around him, 
Fragrant, filling the air with a strange and wonderful sweetness, 
Children. lost in the woods, and covered with leaves in their 
slumber. 
20 “Puritan flowers,” he said, “and the type of Puritan maidens, 
‘Modest and simple and sweet, the very type of Priscilla! 
So I will take them to her; to Priscilla the May-flower of 
Plymouth, 
Modest and simple and sweet, as a parting gift’ will I take them; 
Breathing their silent farewells, as they fade and wither and 
perish, 
Soon to be thrown away as is the heart of the giver.” 
So through the Plymouth woods John Alden went on his errand; 
Came to an open space, and saw the disk of the ocean, 
Sailless, somber, and cold with the comfortless breath of the east- 
wind; : 
Saw the new-built house, and people at work in a meadow; 
so Heard, as he drew near the door, the musical voice of Priscilla 2 
a 
 
-P-A-G-E-452
a = S w s 2 a The Courtship of Miles Standish 435 
Singing the hundredth Psalm, the grand old Puritan anthem, 
Music that Luther sang to the sacred: words of the Psalmist, 
Full of the breath of the Lord, consoling and comforting many. | 
Then, as he opened the door, he beheld the form of the maiden 
Seated beside her wheel, and the carded wool like a snow-drift 
Piled at her knee, her white hands feeding the ravenous spindle, 
While with her foot on the treadle she guided the wheel in its 
motion. 
Open wide on her lap lay the well-worn psalm-book of Ainsworth, 
Printed in Amsterdam, the words and the music together, 
Rough-hewn, angular notes, like stones in the wall of a church- 
yard, 
Darkened and overhung by the running vine of the verses. 
Such was the book from whose pages she sang the old Puritan 
anthem, 
She, the Puritan girl, in the solitude of the forest, : 
Making the humble house and the modest apparel of home-spun 
Beautiful with her beauty, and rich with the wealth of her being! 
Over him rushed, like a wind that is keen and cold and relentless, 
Thoughts of what’ might have been, and the weight and woe of 
his errand; 
All the dreams that had faded, and all the hopes that had van- 
ished, 
All his life henceforth a dreary and tenantless mansion, 
Haunted by vain regzets, and pallid, sorrowful faces. 
Still he said to himseH, and almost fiercely he said it, 
“Let not him that putteth his hand to the plow look backwards; 
Though the plowshare cut through the flowers of life to its 
fountains, 
Though it pass o’er the graves of the dead and the hearts of the 
living, 
It is the will of the Lord; and his mercy endureth forever!” 
So he entered the house; and the hum of the wheel and the 
singing . . 
Suddenly ceased; for Priscilla, aroused by his step on the 
threshold,
-P-A-G-E-453
  436 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
Rose as he entered, and gave him her hand, in signal of welcome, 
Saying, “I knew it was you, when I heard your step in the passage; 
For I was thinking of you, as I sat there singing and spinning.” 
Awkward and dumb with delight, that a thought of him had been 
mingled 
Thus in the sacred psalm, that came from the heart of the maiden, 
Silent before her he stood, and gave her the flowers for an answer, 
Finding no words for his thought. He remembered that day in 
the winter, 
After the first great snow, when he broke a path from the village, 
Reeling and plunging along through the drifts that encumbered the 
doorway, 
Stamping the snow from his feet as he entered the house, and 
Priscilla 
Laughed at his snowy locks, and gave him a seat bythe fireside, 
Grateful and pleased to know he had thought of her in the snow- 
storm. 
Had he but spoken then! perhaps not in vain had he spoken; 
Now it was all too late; the golden moment had vanished! 
1s So he stood there abashed, and gave her the flowers for an answer. M 
S 
Then they sat down and talked of the birds and the. beautiful 
Springtime, 
Talked of their friends at home, and the May Flower that sailed 
on the morrow. 
“T have been thinking all day,” said gently the Puritan maiden, 
“Dreaming all night, and thinking all day, of the hedge-rows of 
_ England— 
20 They are in blossom now, and the country is all like a garden; 
Thinking of lanes and fields, and the song of the lark and the 
linnet, 
Seeing the village street, and familiar faces of neighbors 
Going about as of old, and stopping to gossip together, 
And, at the end of the street, the village church, with the ivy 
2s Climbing the old gray tower, and the quiet graves in the church- 
yard. 
Kind are the people I live with, and dear to me my religion; 
eg
-P-A-G-E-454
The Courtship of Miles Standish 437 
Still my heart is so sad, that I wish myself back in Old England. 
You will say it is wrong, but I cannot help it; I almost 
Wish myself back in Old England, I feel so lonely and wretched.” 
Thereupon answered the youth:—-“Indeed I do not condemn 
you; 
Stouter hearts than a woman’s have quailed in this terrible winter. 
Yours is tender and trusting, and needs a stronger to lean on; 
So I have come to you now, with an offer and proffer of marriage 
Made by a good man and true, Miles Standish the Captain of 
Plymouth!” ow 
Thus he delivered his message, the dexterous writer of letters— 
io Did not embellish the theme, nor array it in beautiful phrases, 
But came straight to the point, and blurted it out like a schoolboy; 
Even the Captain himself could hardly have said it more bluntly. 
Mute with amazement and sorrow, Priscilla the Puritan maiden 
Looked into Alden’s face, her eyes dilated with wonder, 
1s Feeling his words like a blow, that stunned her and rendered her 
speechless ; 
Till at length she exclaimed, interrupting the ominous silence: 
“If the great Captain of Plymouth is so very eager to wed me, 
Why does he not come himself, and take the trouble to woo me? 
If I am not worth the wooing, I surely am not worth the winning!” 
Then John Alden: began explaining and smoothing the matter, 
Making it worse as he went, by saying the Captain was busy— 
Had no time for such things;—such things! the words grating 
harshly 
Fell on the ear of Priscilla; and swift as a flash she made answer: 
“Has he no time for such things, as you call it, before he is married,

Then you make known your desire, with abrupt and sudden 
avowal, 
And are offended and hurt, and indignant perhaps, that a woman 
Does not respond at once to a love that she never suspected, 
Does not attain at a bound the height to which you have been 
climbing. 
This is not right nor just; for surely a woman’s affection 
Is not a thing to be asked for, and had for only the asking. 
When one is truly in love, one not only says it, but shows it. 
Had he but waited awhile, had he only showed that he loved me, 
Even this Captain of yours—who knows?—at last might have 
won me, 
so Old and rough as he is; but now it never can happen.” a 
Still John Alden went on, unheeding the words of Priscilla, 
Urging the suit of his friend, explaining, persuading, expanding; 
Spoke of his courage and skill, and of all his battles in Flanders, 
How with the people of God he had chosen to suffer affliction, 
# How, in return for his zeal, they had made him Captain of 
Plymouth; 
He was a gentleman born, could trace his pedigree plainly 
Back to Hugh Standish of Duxbury Hall, in Lancashire, England, 
Who was the son of Ralph, and the grandson of Thurston de 
Standish; 
Heir unto vast estates, of which he was basely defrauded, 
Still bore the family arms, and had for his crest a cock argent 
Combed and wattled gules, and all the rest of the blazon. 
He was a man of honor, of noble and generous nature; 
Though he was rough, he was kindly; she knew how during the 
winter 
He had attended the sick, with a hand as gentle as woman’s; 
Somewhat hasty and hot, he could not deny it, and headstrong, 
Stern as a soldier might be, but hearty, and placable always, 
Not to be laughed at and scorned, because he was little of stature; 
For he was great of heart, magnanimous, courtly, courageous; 
Any woman in Plymouth, nay any woman in England, 
30 Might be happy and proud to be called the wife of Miles Standish! 2 Ss Fy a

| But as he warmed and glowed, in his simple and eloquent 
language, 
Quite forgetful of self, and full of the praise of his rival, 
Archly the maiden smiled, and, with eyes overrunning with 
laughter, 
Said, in a tremulous voice, “Why don’t you speak for yourself, 
John?” 
JOHN ALDEN 
js Into the open air John Alden, perplexed and bewildered, 
Rushed like a man insane, and wandered alone by the seaside; 
Paced up and down the sands, and bared his head to the east wind, 
Cooling his heated brow, and the fire and fever within him. 
Slowly as out of the heavens, with apocalyptical splendors, 
0 Sank the City of God, in the vision of John the Apostle, 
So, with its cloudy walls of chrysolite, jasper, and sapphire, 
Sank the broad red sun, and over its turrets uplifted 
Glimmered the golden reed of the angel who measured the city. 
“Welcome, O wind of the East!” he exclaimed in his wild exul- 
tation, 
is “Welcome, O wind of the East, from the caves of the misty 
{ Atlantic! 
Blowing o’er fields cf dulse, and measureless meadows of sea- 
grass, 
Blowing o’er rocky wastes, and the grottoes and gardens of ocean! 
Lay thy cold, moist hand on my burning forehead, and wrap me 
; Close in thy garments of mist, to allay the fever within me!” 
20 Like an awakened conscience, the sea was moaning and tossing, 
Beating remorseful and loud the mutable sands of the seashore. 
Fierce in his soul was the struggle and tumult of passions con- 
tending; 
Love triumphant and crowned, and friendship wounded and 
bleeding, 
Passionate cries of desire, and importunate pleadings of duty!

    | Thus as he spake, he turned, in the strength of his strong reso- 
lution, , 
Leaving behind him the shore, and hurried along in the twilight, 
Through the congenial gloom of the forest silent and somber, 
Till he beheld the lights in the seven houses of Plymouth, 
s Shining like seven stars in the dusk and mist of the evening. 
Soon he entered his door, and found the redoubtable Captain 
Sitting alone, and absorbed in the martial pages of Cesar, 
Fighting some great campaign in Hainault or Brabant or Flanders. 
“Long have you been on your errand,” he said with a cheery 
demeanor, 
Even as one who is waiting an answer, and fears not the issue. 
“Not far off is the house, although the woods are between us; 
But you have lingered so long, that while you were going and 
coming 
Ihave fought ten battles and sacked and demolished a city. 
Come, sit down, and in order relate to me all that has happened.” 
% Then John Alden spake, and related the wondrous adventure, 
From beginning to end, minutely, just as it happened; 
How he had seen Priscilla, and how he had sped in his courtship, 
Only smoothing a little, and softening down her refusal. 
; But when he came at length to the words Priscilla had spoken, 
0 Words so tender and cruel: “Why don’t you speak for yourself, 
John?” . 
Up leaped the Captain of Plymouth, and stamped on the floor, 
till his armor 
Clanged on the wall, where it hung, with a sound of sinister omen. 
All his pent-up wrath burst forth in a sudden explosion, 
Even as a hand-grenade, that scatters destruction around it. 
% Wildly he shouted, and loud: “John Alden! you have betrayed me! | 
Me, Miles Standish, your friend! have supplanted, defrauded,

So spake the Captain of Plymouth, and strode about in the 
chamber, 
Chafing and choking with rage; like cords were the veins o1 
temples.

Bringing in uttermost haste a message of urgent importance,

Meanwhile the choleric Captain strode wrathful away tc 
council, 
Found it already assembled, impatiently waiting his coming; 
Men in the middle of life, austere and grave in deportment, 
25 Only one of them old, the hill that was nearest to heaven, 
Covered with snow, but erect, the excellent Elder of PI: 
God had sifted three kingdoms to find the wheat for thi

The Courtship of Miles Standish 443 
  Then had sifted the wheat, as the living seed of a nation; 
So say the chronicles old, and such is.the faith of the people! 
Near them was standing an Indian, in attitude stern and defiant, 
Naked down to the waist, and grim and ferocious in aspect; 
While on the table before them was lying unopened a Bible, 
Ponderous, bound in leather, brass-studded, printed in Holland, 
And beside it outstretched the skin of a rattlesnake glittered, 
Filled, like a quiver, with arrows; a signal and challenge of war- 
fare, 
Brought by the Indian, and speaking with arrowy tongues of 
defiance. 
This Miles Standish beheld, as he entered, and heard them 
debating 
What were an answer befitting the hostile message and menace, 
Talking of this and that, contriving, suggesting, objecting; 
One voice only for peace, and that the voice of the Elder, 
Judging it wise and well that some at least were convérted, 
5 Rather than any were slain, for this was but Christian behavior! 
Then outspoke Miles Standish, the stalwart Captain of Plymouth, 
Muttering deep in his throat, for his voice was husky with anger: 
“What! do you mean to make war with milk and the water of 
roses? 
Is it to shoot red squirrels you have your howitzer planted 
There on the roof of the church, or is it to shoot red devils? 
Truly the only tongue that is understood by a savage 
Must be the tongue of fire that speaks from the mouth of the 
cannon!” 
Thereupon answered and said the excellent Elder of Plymouth, 
Somewhat amazed and alarmed at this irreverent language: 
5 “Not so thought St. Paul, nor yet the other Apostles; 
Not from the cannon’s mouth were the tongues of fire they spake 
with!” 
But unheeded fell this mild rebuke on the Captain, 
Who had advanced to the table, and thus continued discoursing: 
| “Leave this matter to me, for to me by right it pertaineth. 
War is a terrible trade; but in the cause that is righteous, 
Sweet is the smell of powder; and thus I answer the challenge!” i

Then from the rattlesnake’s skin, with a sudden

Jerking the Indian arrows, he filled it with powder and bullets 
Full to the very jaws, and handed it back to the sava; 
Saying, in thundering tones: “Here, take it! this is you:

Talked of their Captain’s departure, and all the dangers that 
menaced, 
He being gone, the town, and what should be done in his absence. 
Merrily sang the birds, and the tender voices of women 
Consecrated with hymns the-common cares of-the household. 
8 Out of the sea rose the sun, and the billows rejoiced at his coming; 
Beautiful were his feet on the purple tops of the mountains; 
Beautiful on the sails of the May Flower riding at anchor, 
Battered and blackened and worn by all the storms of the winter. 
Loosely against her masts was hanging and flapping her canvas, 
o Rent by so many gales, and patched by the hands of the sailors. 
Suddenly from her side, as the sun rose over the ocean, 
Darted a puff of smoke, and floated seaward; anon rang 
Loud over field and forest the cannon’s roar, and the echoes 
Heard and repeated the sound, the signal-gun of departure! 
3 Ah! but with louder echoes replied the hearts of the people! 
Meekly, in voices subdued, the chapter was read from the Bible, 
Meekly the prayer was begun, but ended in fervent entreaty! 
Then from their houses in haste came forth the Pilgrims of 
Plymouth, 
Men and women and children, all hurrying down to the seashore, 
ko Eager, with tearful eyes, to say farewell to the May Flower, 
Homeward bound o’er the sea, and leaving them here in the desert. 
Foremost among them was Alden. All night he had lain with- 
out slumber, 
Turning and tossing about in the heat and unrest of his fever. 
He had beheld Miles Standish, who came back late from the 
| council, 
25 Stalking into the room, and heard him mutter and murmur; 
| Sometimes it seemed a prayer, and sometimes it sounded like 
swearing, 
Once he had come to the bed, and stood there a moment in silence; 
Then he had turned away, and said: “T will not awake him; 
Let him sleep on, it is best; for what is the use of more talking!”

Dressed as he was, and ready to start at the break of the 
morning— 
Covered himself with the cloak he had worn in his campaigns in 
Flanders— 
Slept as a soldier sleeps in his bivouac, ready for action.

Saw him go forth to danger, perhaps to death, and he spake not! 
Then he arose from his bed, and heard what the people were

One still firm on the rock, and talking at times with the sailors, 
Seated erect on the thwarts, all ready and eager for starting. 
He too was eager to go, and thus put an end to his anguish, 
Thinking to fly from despair, that swifter than keel is or canvas, 
Thinking to drown in the sea the ghost that would rise and pursue 
him. . 
But as he gazed on the crowd, he beheld the form of Priscilla 
Standing dejected among them, unconscious of all that was 
passing. . 
Fixed were her eyes upon his, as if she divined his intention, 
Fixed with a look so sad, so reproachful, imploring, and patient, 
That with a sudden revulsion his heart recoiled from its purpose, 
As from the verge of a crag, where one step more is destruction. 
Strange is the heart of man, with its quick, mysterious instincts! 
Strange is the life of man, and fatal or fated are moments, 
Whereupon turn, as on hinges, the gates of the wall adamantine! 
* “Here I remain!” he exclaimed, as he looked at the heavens above 
him, 
Thanking the Lord whose breath had scattered the mist and the 
madness, 
Wherein, blind and lost, to death he was staggering headlong. 
“Yonder snow-white cloud, that floats in the ether above me, 
Seems like a hand that is pointing and beckoning over the 
ocean. . 
There is another hand, that is not so spectral and ghost-like, 
Holding me, drawing me back, and clasping mine for protection. 
Float, O hand of cloud, and vanish away in the ether! 
Roll thyself up like a fist, to threaten and daunt me; I heed not, 
Either your warning or menace, or any omen of evil! 
There is no land so sacred, nor air so pure and so wholesome, 
As is the air she breathes, and the soil that is’ pressed by her 
footsteps. 
Here for her sake will I stay, and like an invisible presence 
Hover around her forever, protecting, supporting her weakness; 
Yes! as my foot was the first that stepped on this rock at the 
landing, 
So, with the blessing of God, shall it be the last at the leaving!”

  Sun-illumined and white, on the eastern verge of the ocean 
Gleamed the departing sail, like a marble slab in a graveyard; 
Buried beneath it lay forever all hope of escaping. . 
Lo! as they turned to depart, they saw the form of an Indian,

Like the spirit of God, moving visibly over the waters. °

Thus fcr a while he stood, and mused by the shore of the ocean, 
Thinking of many things, and most of all of Priscilla; — 
And as if thought had the power to draw to itself, like the load- 
stone, 
Whatsoever it touches, by subtle laws of its nature, 
Lo! as he turned to depart, Priscilla was standing beside him. —e 
“Are you so much offended you will not speak to me?” said she. 
“Am I so much to blame, that yesterday, when you were pleading 
Warmly the cause of another, my heart, impulsive and wayward, 
Pleaded your own, and spake out, forgetful perhaps of decorum? 
Certainly you can forgive me for speaking so frankly, for saying 
What I ought not to have said, yet now I can never unsay it; 
For there are moments in life, when the heart is so full’ of emotion, 
That. if by chance it be shaken, or into its depths like a pebble 
Drops some careless word, it overflows, and its secret,

As if by fighting alone you could win the heart of a woman, 
Quite overlooking yourself and the rest, in exalting your hero. 
Therefore I spake as I did, by an irresistible impulse. 
You will forgive me, I hope, for the sake of the friendship bi

This is not right, is not just, is not true to the best that is in you; 
For I know and esteem you, and feel that your nature is noble,

_, Therefore I value your friendship, and feel it perhaps the more

Most men think so fine, in dealing and speaking with women, 
But which women reject as insipid, if not as insulting.” 
Mute and amazed was Alden; and listened and looked at 
Priscilla, 
6 Thinking he never had seen her more fair, more divine in her 
beauty. ‘ 
He who but yesterday pleaded so glibly the cause of another, 
Stood there embarrassed and silent, and seeking in vain for an 
answer. 
So the maiden went on, and little divined or imagined 
What was at work in his heart, that made him so awkward and 
speechless. 
- #5 “Let us, then, be what we are, and speak what we think, and in 
all things

For I must tell you the truth: much more to me is your friendship 
Than all the love he could give, were he twice the hero you think

Then she extended her hand, and Alden, who eagerly grasped it, 
Felt all the wounds in his heart, that were aching and bleeding 
so sorely,

But, as they went through the fields in the blessing and smile of

Thereupon answered John Alden, and told her the whole of the 
story— 
Told her his own despair, and the direful wrath of Miles Standish. 
Whereat the maiden smiled, and said between laughing and 
earnest, 
“He is a little chimney, and heated hot in a moment!” 
But as he gently rebuked her, and told her how much he had 
suffered— 
How he had even determined to sail that day in the May Flower, 
And had remained for her sake, on hearing the dangers that 
threatened— 
All her manner was changed, and she said with a faltering accent, 
“Truly I thank you for this; how good you have been to me 
always!” 
Thus, as a pilgrim devout, who toward Jerusalem journeys, 
Taking three steps in advance, and ene reluctantly backward, 
Urged by importunate zeal, and withheld by pangs ef contrition;
-P-A-G-E-470
  
The Courtship. of Miles Standish 453 
Slowly but steadily onward, receding yet ever advancing, 
Journeyed this Puritan youth to the Holy Land of his longings, 
Urged by the fervor of love, and withheld by remorseful mis- 
givings. 
THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH 
Meanwhile the stalwart Miles Standish was marching steadily 
northward, 
Winding through forest’ and swamp, and along the trend of the 
seashore, 
All day long; with hardly a halt, the fire of his anger 
Burning and crackling within, and the sulphurous oder of powder 
Seeming more sweet to his nostrils than all the scents of the forest. 
Silent and moody he went, and much he revolved his discomfort; 
He who was used to success, and to easy victories always, 
Thus to be flouted, rejected, and laughed to scorn by a maiden, 
Thus to be mocked and betrayed by the ° friend whom most he had 
trusted! 
Ah! ’t was too much to be borne, and he fretted and chafed in his 
armor! SOOO -—<“ COO CLL OT 
“T alone am to blame,” he muttered, “for mine was the folly. 
as What has a rough old soldier, grown grim and gray in the harness, 
Used to the camp and its ways, to do with the woeing of maidens? 
‘Twas but a dream—let it pass—let it vanish like so many 
others! 
What I thought was a flower, is only 4 weed, and is worthless; 
Out of my heart will I pluck it, and throw it away, and hence- 
forward 
20 Be but a fighter of battles, a lover and wooer of dangers!” 
Thus he revolved in his mind his sorry defeat and discomfort, 
| While he was marching by day or lying at night in the forest, 
Looking up at the trees, and the constellations beyond them. 
’ After a three days’ march he came-to an Indian encampment 
} Pitched on the edge of a meadow, between the sea and the ferest;

Women at work by the tents, and the warriors, horrid with war- 
paint, 
Seated about a fire, and smoking and talking together; 
Whe, when they saw from afar the sudden approach of the white 
men, 
Saw the flash of the sun on breast-plate and saber and musket, 
Straightway leaped to their feet, and two, from among them 
advancing, 
Came to parley with Standish, and offer him furs as a present; 
Friendship was in their looks, but in their hearts there was hatred. 
Braves of the tribe were these, and brothers gigantic in stature, 
Huge as Goliath of Gath, or the terrible Og, king of Bashan; 
One was Pecksuot named, and the other was called Wattawamat. 
Round their necks were suspended their knives in scabbards of 
wampum, . 
Two-edged, trenchant knives, with points as sharp as a needle. 
Other arms had they none, for they were cunning and crafty. 
“Welcome, English!” they said—these words they had learred 
from the traders 
Touching at times on the coast, to barter and chaffer for peltries. 
Then in their native tongue they began to parley with Standish. 
Through his guide and interpreter, Hobomok, friend of the white 
man, 
Begging for blankets and knives, but mostly for muskets and 
powder, 
Kept by the white man, they said, concealed, with the plague, in 
his cellars, 
Ready to be let loose, and destroy his brother the red man! 
But when Standish refused, and said he would give them the Bible, 
Suddenly changing their tone, they began to boast and to bluster. 
Then Wattawamat advanced with a stride in front of the other, 
And, with a lofty demeanor, thus vauntingly spake to the 
Captain: 
“Now Wattawamat can see, by the fiery eyes of the Captain, 
Angry is he in his heart; but the heart of the brave Wattawamat 
Is not afraid at the sight. He was not born of a woman, / 
But on a mountain, at night, from an oak-tree riven by lightning,

Forth he sprang at a bound, with all his weapons about him, 
Shouting, ‘Who is there here to fight with the brave Watta- 
wamat?’” 
Then he unsheathed his knife, and, whetting the blade on his left. 
hand, 
Held it aloft and displayed a woman’s face on the handle, 
: Saying, with bitter expression and look of sinister meaning: 
“T have another at home, with the face of a man on the handle; 
By and by they shall marry ; and there will be plenty of children!” 
Then stood Pecksuot forth, self-vaunting, insulting Miles 
Standish; 
While with his fingers he patted the knife that hung at his bosom, 
Drawing it half from its sheath, and plunging it back, as he 
muttered: 
“By and by it shall see; it shall eat; ah, ha! but shall speak not! 
This is the mighty Captain the white men have sent to destroy us! 
He is a little man; let him go and work with the women!” 
Meanwhile Standish had noted the faces and figures of Indians. 
Peeping and creeping about from bush to tree in the forest, 
Feigning to look for game, with arrows set on their bow-strings, 
Drawing about him still closer and closer the net of their ambush. 
But undaunted he stood, and dissembled and treated them 
smoothly ; 
So the old chronicles say, that were writ in the days of the fathers. 
But when he heard their defiance, the boast, the taunt, and the 
insult, : 
All the hot blood of his race, of Sir Hugh and of Thurston de 
Standish, - 
Boiled and beat in his heart, and swelled in the veins of his 
temples. 
Headlong he leaped on the boaster, and, snatching his knife from 
its seabbard, 
Plunged it into his heart, and, reeling backward, the savage 
% Fell with his face to the sky, and a. fiendlike fierceness upon it. 
Straight there arose from the forest the awful sound of the war- 
whoop,
-P-A-G-E-473
  456 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
And, like a flurry of snow on the whistling wind of December, 
Swift and sudden and keen came a flight of feathery arrows. 
Then came a cloud of smoke, and out of the cloud came the 
lightning, : 
Out of the lightning thunder; and death unseen ran before it. 
8 Frightened, the savages fled for shelter in swamp and in thicket. 
Hotly pursued and beset; but their sachem, the brave Watta- 
wamat, . 
Fled not; he was dead. Unswerving and swift had a bullet 
Passed through his brain, and he fell with both hands clutching 
the greensward, 
Seeming in death to hold back from his foe the land of his fathers. 
ao There on the flowers of the meadow the warriors lay, and above 
them, 
Silent, with folded arms, stood Hobomok, friend of the white man. 
Smiling at length, he exclaimed to the stalwart Captain of 
Plymouth: 
“Pecksuot bragged very loud, of his courage, his strength, and 
his stature— 
Mocked the great Captain, and’ called him a little man; but I 
"see now 
1s Big enough have you been to lay him speechless before you!” 
Thus the first battle was fought and won by the stalwart Miles 
Standish. - 
When the tidings thereof were brought to the village of Plymouth, 
And as a trophy of war the head of the brave Wattawamat 
Scowled from the roof of the fort, which at once was a church 
and a fortress, 
20 All who beheld it rejoiced, and praised the Lord, and took courage. 
Only Priscilla averted her face from this specter of terror, 
Thanking God in her heart that she had not married Miles 
Standish; . 
Shrinking, fearing almost, lest, coming home from his battles, 
He should lay claim’ to her hand, as the prize and reward of his 
valor. ,

THE SPINNING-W HEEL 
Month after month passed away, and in autumn the ships ef the 
merchants 
Came with kindred and friends, with cattle and corn for the 
Pilgrims. 
All in the village was peace; the men were intent on their labors, 
Busy with hewing and building, with garden-plot and with mere- 
stead, 
ls Busy with breaking the glebe, and mowing the grass in n the 
meadows, 
Searching the sea for its fish, and hunting the deer in the forest. 
All in the village was peace; but at times the rumor of warfare 
Filled the air with alarm, and the apprehension of danger. 
Bravely the stalwart Miles Standish was scouring the land with 
his. forces, 
to Waxing valiant in fight and defeating the alien armies, 
Till his name had become a sound of fear to the nations. 
Anger was still in his heart, but at times the remorse and con- 
trition 
Which in all noble natures , succeed the passionate outbreak, 
Came like a rising tide, that encounters the rush of a river, 
15 Staying its current awhile, but making it bitter and brackish. i 
Meanwhile Alden at home had ‘built him a new habitation, 
Solid, substantial, of timber roughhewn from the firs of the forest. 
Wooden-barred was the door, and the roof was covered with 
rushes; 
Latticed the windows were, and the window-panes were of paper, 
20 Oiled to admit the light, while wind and rain were excluded. 
There too he dug a well, and around it planted an orchard: 
Still may be ‘seen to this day some trace of the well ané ~he 
orchard. 
Close to the house was the stall, where, safe and secure from an- 
noyance, 
Raghorn, the snow-white bull, that had fallen to Alden’s allet- 
ment

In the division of cattle, might ruminate in the night-time 
Over the pastures he cropped, made fragrant by sweet penny- 
royal. 
Oft when his labor was finished, with eager feet woul 
dreamer 
Follow the pathway that ran through the woods to the hou: 
Priscilla, 
‘Led by illusions romantic and subtle deceptions of fancy, 
Pleasure disguised as duty, and love in the semblance of friend- 
ship. 
Ever of her he thought, when he fashioned the walls of his dwell- 
ing; 
Ever of her he thought, when he delved in the soil of his garden; 
Ever of ker he thought, when he read in his Bible on Sunday 
Praise of the virtuous woman, as she is described in the Prov- a 
i 
2 
How the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her always, 
How all the days of her life she will do him good, and not evil, 
How she seeketh the wool and the flax and worketh with gladness, 
How she layeth her hand to the spindle and holdeth the distaff, 
How she is not afraid of the snow for herself or her household, 
Knowing her household are clothed with the scarlet cloth of her 
weaving! i 
So as she sat at her wheel one afternoon in the Autumn, 
Alden, who opposite sat, and was watching her dexterous fingers, 
As if the thread she was spinning were that of his life and his 
fortune, 
After a pause in their talk, thus spake to the sound of the spindle. 
“Truly, Priscilla,” he said, “when I see you spinning and spinning, 
Never idle a moment, but thrifty and thoughtful of others, 
Suddenly you are transformed, are visibly changed in a moment; 
You are no longer Priscilla, but Bertha the Beautiful Spinner.”

Uttered an angry snarl, and the thread snapped short in her 
fingers; 
While the impetuous speaker, not heeding the mischief, con- 
tinued: 
“You are the beautiful Bertha, the spinner, the queen of Helvetia; 
She whose story I read at a stall in the streets of Southampton, 
Who, as she rode on her palfrey, o’er valley and meadow and 
mountain, 
Ever was spinning her thread from a distaff fixed to her saddle. 
She was so thrifty and good that her name passed into a proverb. 
So shall it be with your own, when the spinning-whcel shall no 
longer ‘ 
Hum in the house of the farmer, and fill its chambers with 
music. 
Then shall the mothers, reproving, relate how it was in their child- 
hood, 
Praising the good old times, and the days of Priscilla the spin- 
ner!” 
Straight uprose from her wheel the beautiful Puritan maiden, 
Pleased with the praise of her thrift from him whose praise was 
the sweetest, 
Drew from the reel on the table a snowy skein of her spinning, 
Thus making answer, meanwhile, to the flattering phrases of 
Alden: 
“Come, you must not be idle; if I am a pattern for housewives, 
Show yourself equally worthy of being the model of husbands. 
Hold this skein on your hands, while I wind it, ready for knitting; 
Then who knows but hereafter, when fashions have changed and 
the manners, 
Fathers may talk to their sons of the good old times of John 
Alden!” . : 
Thus, with a jest and a laugh, the skein on his hands she adjusted,. 
He sitting awkwardly there, with his arms extended before him, 
She standing graceful, erect, and winding the thread from his 
fingers, 
Sometimes chiding a little his clumsy manner of holding, 
Sometimes touching his hands, as she disentangled expertly

Twist.or knot in the yarn, unawares—for how could she help it?— 
Sending electrical thrills through every nerve in his body. 
Lo! in the midst of this scene, a breathless messenger entered, 
Bringing in hurry and heat the terrible news from the village. 
Yes; Miles Standish was dead!—an Indian had brought them the 
tidings— 
Slain by a poisoned arrow, shot down in the front of the battle, 
Into an ambush beguiled, cut off with the whole of his forces; 
All the town would be burned, and all the-people be murdered! 
Such were the tidings of evil that burst on the hearts of the 
hearers. 
Silent and statue-like stood Priscilla, her face looking backward 
Still at the face of the speaker, her arms uplifted in horror; 
But John Alden, upstarting, as if the barb of the arrow 
Piercing the heart of his friend had struck his own, and had sun- 
dered 
Once and forever the bonds that held him bound as a captive, 
Wild with excess of sensation, the awful delight of his freedom, 
Mingled with pain and regret, unconscious of what he was doing. 
Clasped, almost with a groan, the motionless form of Priscilla, 
Pressing her close to his heart, as forever his own, and exclaiming: 
“Those whom the Lord hath united, let no man put them 
asunder!” 
Even as rivulets twain, from distant and separate sources, 
Seeing each other afar, as they leap from the rocks, and pursuing 
Each one its devious path, but drawing nearer and nearer, 
Rush together at last, at their trysting-place in the forest; 
So these lives that had run thus far in separate channels, 
Coming in sight of each other, then swerving and flowing asunder, 
Parted by barriers strong, but drawing nearer and nearer, 
Rushed together at last, and one was lost in the other. 
THE WEDDING DAY 
Forth from the curtain of clouds, from the tent of purple ant 
scarlet,
-P-A-G-E-478
  The Courtship of Miles Standish : 461 
  Issued the sun, the great High-Priest, in his garments resplen- 
dent, / 
Holiness unto the Lord, in letters of light, on his forehead, 
Round the hem of his robe the golden bells and pomegranates. 
Blessing the world he came, and the bars of vapor beneath him 
5 Gleamed like a grate of brass, and the sea at his feet was a laver! 
| This was the wedding morn-.of Priscilla the Puritan maiden. 
Friends were assembled together; the Elder and Magistrate also 
Graced the scene with their presence, and stoed like the Law and 
the Gospel, 
One with the sanctien of earth and one with the blessing of 
heaven. ‘ 
o Simple and brief was the wedding, as that of Ruth and of Boaz. 
Softly the youth and the maiden repeated the words of betrothal, 
Taking each other for husband and wife in the Magistrate’s 
presence, 
After the Puritan way, and the laudable custom of:Holland. 
Fervently then, and devoutly, the excellent Elder of Plymouth 
ns Prayed for the hearth and the home, that were founded that day 
in affection, 
Speaking of life and of death, and imploring divine benedictions. 
Lo! when the service was ended, a form appeared on the 
threshold, 
Clad in armor of steel, a somber and sorrowful figure! 
Why does the bridegreem start and stare at the strange appari- 
tion? 
20 Why does the bride turn pale, and hide her face on his shoulder? 
Is it a phantom of air—a bodiless spectral illusion? 
Is it a ghost from the grave, that has come to forbid the betrethal? 
Long had it stood there unseen, a guest uninvited, unwelcomed ; 
Over its clouded eyes there had passed at times an expression 
25 Softening the gloom and revealing the warm heart hidden beneath 
them, 
As when across the sky the driving rack of the rain-cloud 
Grows for a moment thin, and betrays the sun by its brightness.
-P-A-G-E-479

Once it had lifted its hand, and moved its lips, but was silent, 
Ags if an iron will had mastered the fleeting intention. 
But when were ended the troth and the prayer and the last bene- 
diction, 
Into the room it strode, and the people beheld with amazement 
Bodily there in his armor Miles Standish, the Captain of Plym- 
outh! 
Grasping the bridegroom’s hand, he said with emotion, “Forgive 
me! 
I have been angry and hurt—too long have I cherished the 
feeling; 
I have been cruel and hard, but now, thank God! it is ended. 
Mine is the same hot blood that leaped in the veins of Hugh 
Standish, 
Sensitive, swift to resent, but as swift in atoning- for error. 
Neyer so much as now was Miles Standish the friend of John 
Alden.” 
Thereupon answered the bridegroom: “Let all be forgotten be- 
tween us— 
All save the dear old friendship, and that shall grow older and 
dearer!” — 
Then the Captain advanced, and, bowing, saluted Priscilla, 
Gravely, and after the manner of old-fashioned gentry in Eng- 
land, 
Something of camp and of court, of town and of country, com- 
mingled, 
Wishing her joy of her wedding, and loudly lauding her hus- 
band. 
Then he said with a smile: “I should have remembered the 
adage— 
If you would be well served, you must serve yourself; and more- 
over, 
No man can gather cherries in Kent at the season of Christmas!” 
Great was the people’s amazement, and greater yet their rejoic- 
ing, 
Thus to behold once more the sunburnt face of their Captain,
-P-A-G-E-480
  The Courtship of Miles Standish 463 
  Whom they had mourned as dead; and they gathered and crowded 
about him, 
Eager to see him and hear him, forgetful of bride and of bride- 
groom, 
Questioning, answering, laughing, and each interrupting the other, 
Till the good Captain declared, being quite overpowered and 
bewildered, . 
He had rather by far break into an Indian encampment, 
Than come again to a wedding to which he had not been invited. 
o 
Meanwhile the bridegroom went forth and stood with the bride at: 
the doorway, 
Breathing the perfumed air of that warm and beautiful morning. 
Touched with autumnal tints, but lonely and sad in the sunshine, 
Lay extended before them the land of toil and. privation; 
There were the graves of the dead, and the barren waste of the 
seashore, 
There the familiar fields, the groves of pine, and the meadows; 
| But to their eyes transfigured, it seemed as the Garden of Eden, 
Filled with the: presence of God, whose voice was the sound of the _ 
ocean, , ° 
1 Soon was their vision disturbed by the noise and stir of de- 
parture, 
Friends coming forth from the house, and impatient of tonger 
' delaying, 
Each with his plan for the day, and the work that was left uncom- 
pleted. . 
Then from a stall near at hand, amid exclamations of wonder, 
Alden the thoughtful, the careful, so happy, so proud of Priscilla, 
20 Brought out.his snow-white bull, obeying the hand of its master, 
Led by a cord that was tied to an iron ring in its nostrils, 
Covered with crimson cloth, and a cushion placed for a saddle. 
She should not walk, he said, through the dust and heat of the 
noon-day ; 
Nay, she should ride like a queen, not plod along like a peasant. 
« Somewhat alarmed at first, but reassured by the others,
-P-A-G-E-481

  464 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
  Placing her hand on the cushion, her foot in the hand of her hus- 
band, 
Gayly, with joyous laugh, Priscilla mounted her palfrey. 
“Nothing is wanting now,” he said, with a smile, “but the distaff; 
Then you would be in truth my queen, my beautiful Bertha!” 
Onward the bridal procession now moved to their new habita- 
tion, 
Happy husband and wife, and friends conversing together. 
Pleasantly murmured the brook, as they crossed the ford in the 
forest, 
Pleased with the image that passed, like a dream of love through 
its bosom, 
Tremuleus, fleating in air, o’er the depths of the azure abysses. 
Down through the golden leaves the sun was pouring his splendors, 
Gleaming on purple grapes, that, from branches above them sus- 
pended, : 
‘Mingled their odorous breath with the balm of the pine and the 
fir-tree, 
Wild and sweet as the clusters that grew in the valley of Eshcol. 
Like a picture it seemed of the primitive pastoral ages, 
Fresh with the youth of the world, and recalling Rebecca and 
Isaac, ‘ 
Old and yet ever new, and simple and beautiful always, 
Love immortal and young in the endless succession of lovers. 
So through the Plymouth woods passed onward the bridal pro- 
cession.

Bt AMERICAN SCENES AND LEGENDS 
  a 2 x MY VISIT TO NIAGARA 
NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE 
Never did a pilgrim approach Niagara with deeper enthusiasm 
than mine. I had lingered away from it, and wandered to other 
scenes, because my treasury of anticipated enjoyments, comprising 
all the wonders of the world, had nothing else so magnificent, and I 
was loath to exchange the pleasures of hope for those of memory so 
soon. At length the day came. The stage-coach, with a French- 
man and myself on the back seat, had already left Lewiston, and 
in less than an hour would set us down in Manchester. I began to 
listen for the roar of the cataract, and trembled with a sensation 
like dread, as the moment drew righ, when its voice of ages must 
roll, for the first time, on my ear. The French gentleman stretched 
himself from the window, and expressed loud admiration, while, by 
a sudden impulse, I threw myself back and closed my eyes. When 
the scene shut in, I was glad to think, that for me the whole burst 
of Niagara was yet in futurity. We rolled on, and entered the 
village of Manchester, bordering on the falls. : 
I am quite ashamed of myself here. Not that I ran like a 
madman to the falls, and plunged into the thickest of the spray— 
never stopping to breathe, till breathing was impossible; not that

  I committed this, or any other suitable extravagance. On the con- 
trary, I alighted with perfect decency and composure, gave my 
cloak to the black waiter, pointed out my baggage, and inquired, 
not the nearest way to the cataract, but about the dinner-hour. 
The interval was spent in arranging my dress. Within the last 
fifteen minutes, my mind had grown strangely benumbed, and my 
spirits apathetic, with a slight depression, not decided enough to 
be termed sadness. My enthusiasm was in a deathlike slumber. 
Without aspiring to immortality, as he did, I could have imitated 
that English traveler who turned back from the point where he 
first heard the thunder of Niagara, after crossing the occan to 
behold it. Many a Western trader, by the by, has performed a 
similar act of heroism with more heroic simplicity, deeming it no 
such wonderful feat to dine at the hotel and resume his route to 
Buffalo or Lewiston, while the cataract was roaring unseen. 
Such has often been my apathy, when objects, long sought, and 
earnestly desired, were placed within my reach. After dinner—at 
which ah unwonted and perverse epicurism detained me longer 
than usual—I lighted a cigar and paced the piazza, minutely 
attentive to the aspect and business of a very ordinary village. 
Finally, with reluctant step, and the feeling of an intruder, I 
walked toward Goat Island. At the toll-house, there were further - 
excuses for delaying the inevitable moment. My signature was 
required in a huge ledger, containing similar records innumerable, 
many of which I read. The skin of a great sturgeon, and other 
fishes, beasts, and reptiles; a collection of minerals, such as lie in 
heaps near the falls; some Indian moccasins, and other trifles, 
made of deer-skin and embroidered with beads; several news- 
papers, from Montreal, New York, and Boston—all attracted me 
in turn. Out of a number of twisted sticks, the manufacture of a 
Tuscarora Indian, I selected one of curled maple, curiously con- 
voluted, and adorned with the carved images of a snake and a fish, 
Using this as my pilgrim’s staff, I crossed the bridge. Above and 
below me were the rapids, a river of impetuous snow, with here 
and there a dark rock amid its whiteness, resisting all the physical 
fury, asany cold spirit did the moral influences of the scene. On 
reaching Goat Island, which separates the two great segments of

  the falls, I chose the right-hand path, and followed it to the edge 
of the American cascade. There, while the falling sheet was yet 
invisible, I saw the vapor that never vanishes, and the Eternal 
Rainbow of Niagara. 
It was-an afternoon of glorious sunshine, without a cloud, save 
‘those of the cataracts. I gained an insulated rock, and beheld a 
broad sheet of brilliant and unbroken foam, not shooting in a 
eurved line from the top of the precipice, but falling headlong 
down from height to depth.’ A narrow stream diverged from the 
main branch, and hurried over the crag by a channel of its own, 
leaving a little pine-clad island and a streak of precipice between 
itself and the larger sheet. Below arose the mist, on which was 
painted a dazzling sunbow with two concentric shadows—one, 
almost as perfect as the original brightness; and the other, drawn 
faintly round the broken edge of the cloud. 
Still I had not half seen Niagara. Following the verge of the 
island, the path led me to the Horseshoe, where the real, broad St. 
Lawrence, rushing along on a level with its banks, pours its whole 
breadth over a concave line of precipice, and thence pursues its 
course between lofty crags toward Ontario. <A sort of. bridge, two 
or three feet wide, stretches out along the edge of the descending 
sheet, and hangs upon the rising mist, as if that were the founda- 
tion of the frail structure. Here I stationed myself in the blast 
of wind, which the rushing river bore along with it. The bridge 
was tremulous beneath me, and marked the tremor of the solid 
earth. I looked along the whitening rapids, and endeavored to 
distinguish a mass of water far above the falls, to follow it to their 
verge, and go down with it, in fancy, to the abyss of clouds and 
storm. Casting my eyes across the river, and every side, I took in 
the whole scene at a glance, and tried to comprehend it in one vast 
idea. After an hour thus spent, I left the bridge, and by a stair- 
case, winding almost interminably round a post, descended to the 
base of the precipice. From that point, my path lay over slippery 
stones, and among great fragments of the cliff, to the edge of the 
cataract, where the wind at once enveloped me in spray, and per- 
haps dashed the rainbow round me. Were my long desires ful- 
filled? And had I seen Niagara?
-P-A-G-E-486
  My Visit to Niagara 469 
—_— 
Oh, that I had never heard of Niagara till I beheld it! Blessed 
were the wanderers of old, who heard its deep roar, sounding 
chrough the woods, as the summons to an unknown wonder, and 
approached its awful brink, in all the freshness of native feeling. 
s Had its own mysterious voice been the first to warn me of its 
existence, then, indeed, I might have knelt down and worshiped. 
But I had come thither, haunted with a vision of foam and fury, 
and dizzy cliffs, and an ocean tumbling down out of the sky—a 
scene, in short, which nature had too much good taste and calm 
‘10 simplicity to realize. My mind had struggled to adapt these false 
conceptions to the reality, and finding the effort vain, a wretched 
sense of disappointment weighed me down. I climbed the preci- 
pice, and threw myself on the earth, feeling that I was unworthy 
to look at the Great Falls, and careless about beholding them 
15 again. 
All that night, as there has been and will be for ages past and 
to come, a rushing sound was heard, as if a great tempest were 
sweeping through the air. It mingled with my dreams, and made 
them full of storm and whirlwind. Whenever I awoke, and heard 
20 this dread sound in the air, and the windows rattling as with a 
mighty blast, I could not rest again, till looking forth, I saw 
how bright the stars were, and that ‘every leaf in the garden was 
motionless. Never was a summer night more calm to the eye, nor 
a gale of autumn louder to the ear. The rushing sound proceeds 
25 from the rapids, and the rattling of the casements is but an effect 
of the vibration of the whole house, shaken by the jar of the 
cataract. The noise of the rapids draws the attention from the 
true voice of Niagara, which is a dull, muffled thunder, resounding 
between the cliffs. I spent a wakeful hour at midnight, in dis- 
so tinguishing its reverberations, and rejoiced to find that my former 
awe and enthusiasm were reviving. 
Gradually, and after much contemplation, I came to know, by 
my own feelings, that Niagara is indeed a wonder of the world, 
and not the less wonderful, because time and thought must be 
33 emmpleyed in comprehending it. Casting aside all preconceived 
notions, and preparation to be dire-struck or delighted, the be- 
holder:must stand beside it in the simplicity of his heart, suffer- ’

ing the mighty scene to work its own impression. Night after 
night I dreamed of it, and was gladdened every morning by the 
conscjousness of a growing capacity to enjoy it. Yet I will not 
pretend to the all-absorbing enthusiasm of some more fortunate 
s spectators, nor deny that very trifling causes would draw my eyes 
and thoughts from the cataract. 
The last day that I was to spend at Niagara, before my - depar- 
ture for the Far West, I sat upon the Table Rock. This cele- 
brated station did not now, as of old, project fifty feet beyond the 
1o line of the precipice, but was shattered by the fall of an immense 
fragment, which lay distant on the shore below. Still, on the 
utmost verge of the rock, with my feet hanging over it, I felt as 
if suspended in the open air. Never before had my mind been in 
such perfect unison with the scene. There were intervals when I 
15 was conscious of nothing but the great river, rolling calmly into 
the abyss, rather descending than precipitating itself, and acquir- 
ing tenfold majesty from its unhurried motion. It came like the 
march of Destiny. It was not taken by surprise, but seemed to 
have anticipated, in all its course through the broad lakes, that it 
ze must pour their collected waters down this height. The perfect 
foam of the river, after its descent, and the ever-varying shapes 
of mist, rising up, to become clouds in the sky, would be the very 
picture of confusion, were it merely transient, like the rage of a 
tempest. But when the beholder has stood awhile, and perceives 
25 no lull in the storm, and considers that the vapor and the foam 
are as everlasting as the rocks which produce them, all this tur- 
moil assumes a sort of calmness. It soothes, while it awes the 
mind. 
Leaning over the cliff, I saw the guide conducting two adven- 
so turers behind the falls. It was pleasant, from that high seat in 
the sunshine, to observe them struggling against the eternal storm 
of the lower regions, with heads bent down, now faltering, now 
pressing forward, and finally swallowed up in their victory. After 
their disappearance, a blast rushed out with an old hat, which it 
33 had swept from one of their heads. The rock, to which they were 
directing their unseen course, is marked, at a fearful distance on 
the exterior of the sheet, by a jet of foam. The attempt to reach

  it appears both poetical and perilous to a looker-on, but may be 
accomplished without much more difficulty or hazard than in 
stemming a violent northeaster. In a few moments, forth came 
the children of the mist. Dripping and breathless, they crept 
5 along the base of the cliff, ascended. to the guide’s cottage, and 
received, I presume, a certificate of their achievement, with three 
verses of sublime poetry on the back. : 
My contemplations were often interrupted by strangers who 
came down from Forsyth’s to take their first view of the falls. 
io A short, ruddy, middle-aged gentleman, fresh from Old England, 
peeped over the rock, and evinced his approbation by a broad 
grin. His spouse, a very robust lady, afforded a sweet example of 
maternal solicitude, being so intent on the safety of her little boy 
that she did not even glance at Niagara. As for the child, he gave 
13 himself wholly to the enjoyment of a stick of candy. Another 
traveler, a native American, and no rare character among us, pro- 
duced a volume of Captain Hall’s tour, and labored earnestly to 
adjust Niagara to the captain’s description, departing, at last, 
without one new idea or sensation of his own. The next comer was 
20 provided, not with a printed book, but with a blank sheet of fools- 
cap, from top to bottom of which, by means of an ever-pointed 
pencil, the cataract was made to thunder. In a little talk which 
we had together, he awarded his approbation to the general view, 
but censured the position of Goat Island, observing that it should 
25 have been thrown farther to the right, so as to widen the American 
falls, and contract those of the Horseshoe. Next appeared two 
traders of-Michigan, who declared, that, upon the whole, the sight 
was worth looking at; there certainly was an immense water- 
power here; but that, after all, they would go twice as far to see 
30 the noble stone-works of Lockport, where the Grand Canal is 
locked down a descent of sixty feet. They were succeeded by a 
young fellow, in a homespun cotton dress, with a staff in his hand, 
and a pack over his shoulders. He advanced close to the edge of 
the rock, where his attention, at first wavering among the differ- 
! s ent components of the scene, finally became fixed in the angle of 
the Horseshoe falls, which is indeed the central point of interest. 
His whole soul seemed to go forth and be transported thither, till

the staff slipped from his relaxed grasp, and falling down—down— 
down—struck upon the fragment of the Table Rock. 
In this manner I spent some hours, watching the varied im- 
pression made by the cataract on those who disturbed me, and 
returning to unwearied contemplation, when left alone. At length 
my time came to depart. There is a grassy footpath through the 
woods, along the summit of the bank, to a point whence a cause- 
way, hewn in the side of the precipice, goes winding down to the 
Ferry, about half a mile below the Table Rock. ‘The sun was near 
setting, when I emerged from the shadow of the trees, and began 
the descent. The indirectness of my downward road continually 
changed the point of view, and showed me, in rich and repeated 
succession, now, the whitening rapids and majestic leap of the 
main river, which appeared more deeply massive as the light de- 
parted; now, the lovelier picture, yet still sublime, of Goat Island, 
with its rocks and grove, and the lesser falls, tumbling over the 
right bank of the St. Lawrence, like a tributary stream; now, the 
long vista of the river, as it eddied and whirled between the cliffs, 
to pass through Ontario toward the sea, and everywhere to be won- 
dered at, for this one unrivaled scene. The golden sunshine tinged 
the sheet of the American cascade, and painted on its heaving 
spray the broken semi-circle of a rainbow, heaven’s own beauty 
crowning earth’s sublimity. My steps were slow, and I paused 
long at every turn of the descent, as one lingers and pauses who 
discerns a brighter and brightening excellence in what he must 
soon behold-no more. The solitude of the old wilderness now 
reigned over the whole vicinity of the falls. My enjoyment be- 
came the more rapturous, because no poet shared it, nor wretch 
devoid of poetry profaned it; but the spot so famous through the 
world was all my own!

FROM MORN TILL NIGHT ON A FLORIDA RIVER 
: _SIDNEY LANIER 
For a perfect journey God gave us a perfect day. The little 
Ocklawaha steamboat Marion had started on-her voyage some 
hours before daylight. She had taken on her passengers the night 
previous. By seven o’clock on such a May morning as no words 
6 could describe we had made twenty-five miles up the St. Johns. 
At this point the Ocklawaha flows into the St. Johns, one hun- 
dred miles above Jacksonville. 
Presently we abandoned the broad highway of the St. Johns, 
and turned off to the right into the narrow lane of the Ockla- 
20 waha, This is the sweetest water-lane in the world, a lane which 
runs for more than one hundred and fifty miles of pure delight 
betwixt hedge-rows of oaks and cypresses and palms and magno- 
lias and mosses and vines; a lane clean to travel, for there is never 
a speck of dust in it save the blue dust and gold dust which the 
3 wind blows out of the flags and lilies. 
As we advanced up the stream our wee craft seemed to emit her 
steam in leisurely whiffs, as one puffs one’s cigar in a contempla- 
tive walk through the forest. Dick, the pole-man, lay asleep on

the guards, in great peril of rolling into the river over the three 
inches between his length and the edge; the people of the boat 
moved not, and spoke not; the white crane, the curlew, the heron, 
5 the water-turkey, were scarcely disturbed in their quiet avoca- 
tions as we passed, and quickly succeeded in persuading them- 
selves after each momentary excitement of our gliding by, that 
we were really no monster, but only some day-dream of a monster. 
“Look at that snake in the water!” said a gentleman, as we sat 
10 on deck with the engineer, just come up from his watch. 
The engincer smiled. “Sir, it is a water-turkey,” he said, 
gently. 
The water-turkey is the most preposterous bird within the 
range of ornithology. He is not a bird; he is a neck with such 
1s subordinate rights, members, belongings, and heirlooms as seem 
necessary to that end. He has just enough stomach to arrange 
nourishment for his neck, just enough wings to fly painfully along 
with his neck, and just big enough legs to keep his neck from 
dragging on the ground; and his neck is light-colored, while the 
20 rest of him is black. When he saw us he jumped up on a limb 
and stared. Then suddenly he dropped into the water, sank like 
a leaden ball out of sight, and made us think he was drowned. 
Presently the tip of his beak appeared, then the length of his neck 
lay along the surface of the water. In this position, with his body 
25 submerged, he shot out his neck, drew it back, wriggled it, twisted 
it, twiddled it, and poked it spirally into the east, the west, the 
north, and the south, round and round with a violence and energy 
that made one think in the same breath of corkscrews and of light- 
nings. But what nonsense! All that labor and perilous contortion 
30 for a beggarly sprat or a couple of inches of water-snake. 
Some twenty miles from the mouth of the Ocklawaha, at the 
right-hand edge of the stream, is the handsomest residence in 
America. It belongs to a certain alligator of my acquaintance, 
a very honest and worthy reptile of good repute. A little cove of 
as water, dark-green under the overhanging leaves, placid and clear, 
curves round at the river edge into the flags and lilies, with a curve 
just heart-breaking for its pure beauty. This house of the alligator 
is divided into apartments, little bays which are scalloped. out by

the lily-pads, according to the winding fancies of their growth. 
My reptile, when he desires to sleep, has but to lie down anywhere; 
he will find marvelous mosses for his mattress beneath him; his 
sheets will be white lily-petals; and the green disks of the lily- 
pads will straightway embroider themselves together above him 
for his coverlet. He never quarrels with his cook, he is not the 
, slave of a kitchen, and his one house-maid—the stream—forever 
"sweeps his chambers clean. His conservatories there under the 
glass of that water are ever, without labor, filled with the enchant- 
ments of under-water growths. . 
His parks and his pleasure-grounds are larger than any king’s. 
Upon my saurian’s house the winds have no power, the rains are 
only a new delight to him, and the snows he will never see. Re- 
garding fire, as he does not use it as a slave, so he does not fear 
it as a tyrant. 
Thus all the elements are the friends of my alligator’s house. 
While he sleeps he is being bathed. What glory to awake sweet- 
ened and freshened by the sole, careless act of sleep! 
Lastly, my saurian has unnumbered mansions, and can change 
his dwelling as no human house-holder may; it is but a flip of his 
tail, and Io! he is established in another place as good as the last, 
ready furnished to his liking. . 
On and on up the river! We find it a river without banks. 
The swift, deep current meanders between tall lines of trees; 
beyond these, on either side, there is water also—a thousand shal- - 
low rivulets lapsing past the bases of a multitude of trees. 
Along the edges of the stream every tree-trunk, sapling, and 
stump is wrapped about with a close-growing vine. The edges of 
the stream are also defined by flowers and water-leaves. The tall 
blue flags, the lilies sitting on their round lily-pads like white 
queens on green thrones, the tiny stars and long ribbons of the wa- 
ter-grasses—all these border the river in an infinite variety of 
adornment. 
And now, after this day of glory, came a night of glory. 
33 Deep down in these shaded lanes it was dark indeed as the night 
drew on. The stream which had been all day a girdle of beauty, 
blue or green, now became a black band of mystery. ve S

But presently a brilliant flame flares out overhead: They have 
lighted the pine-knots on top of the pilot-house. The fire ad- 
vances up these dark windings like a brilliant god. 
The startled birds suddenly flutter into the light and after an 
instant of illuminated flight melt into the darkness. From the 
perfect silence of these short flights one derives a certain sense 
of awe. . : 
Now there is a mighty crack and crash: limbs and leaves 
scrape and scrub along the deck; a little bell tinkles; we stop. In 
turning a shert curve, the boat has run her nose smack into the 
right bank, and a projecting stump has thrust itself sheer through 
the starboard side. Out, Dick! Out, Henry! Dick and Henry 
shuffle ferward to the bow, thrust forth their long white pole 
against a tree-trunk, strain and push and bend to the deck as if 
they were salaaming the god of night and adversity. Our bow 
slowly reunds into the stream, the wheel turns and we puff quietly 
along. 
And now it is bed-time. Let me tell you how to sleep on an 
Ocklawaha steamer in May. With a small bribe persuade Jim, 
the steward, to take the mattress out of your berth and lay it 
slanting just along the railing that encloses the lower part of the 
deck in front and to the left of the pilot-house. Lie flat on your 
back down on the mattress, draw your blanket over you, put your 
cap on your head, on account of the night air, fold your arms, 
say some little prayer or other, and fall asleep with a star looking 
right down en your eye. When you wake in the morning you will 
feel as new as Adam.

Or hides him far in the forest, shade, 
When the woods resound in the dewy morn 
With the clang of the merry hunter’s horn.

Hangs over the scarlet creeper’s bloom; 
While ’midst the leaves his varying dyes 
Sparkle like half-seen fairy eyes. . 
There the echoes ring through the livelong day 
With the mock-bird’s changeful roundelay; 
And at night, when the scene is calm and still,

5 protection of St. Nicholas when they crossed, there lies a small 
market-town or rural port, which by some is calied Greensburgh, 
but which is more generally and properly known by the name of 
Tarry Town. This name was given, we are told, in former days, 
by the good housewives of the adjacent country, from the invet- 
'6 erate propensity of their husbands to linger about the village 
tavern on market days. Be that as it may, I do not vouch for 
| the fact, but merely advert to it, for the sake of being precise and 
authentic. Not far from this village, perhaps about two miles, 
| there is a little valley, or rather lap of land, among high hills, 
's which is one of the quietest places in the whole world. A small 
brook glides through it, with just murmur enough to lull one to 
repose; and the occasional whistle of a quail, or tapping of a 
woodpecker, is almost the only sound that ever breaks in upon 
the uniform tranquillity. 
fe T recollect that, when a stripling, my first exploit in squirrel- 
shooting was in a grove of tall walnut trees that shades one side 
| of the valley. I had wandered into it at noon time, when all nature 
is peculiarly quiet, and was startled by the roar of my own gun, 
as. it broke-the Sabbath stillness around, and was prolonged and 
|: reverberated by the angry echoes. If ever I should wish for a

retreat, whither I might steal from the world and it 
and dream quietly away the remnant of a trouble 
of none more promising than this little valley. 
From the listless repose of the place, and the peculiar character 
of its inhabitants, who are descendants from the original Dutch 
settlers, this sequestered glen has long been known by the name 
of Sleepy Hollow, and its rustic lads are called the Sleepy Hollow 
Boys throughout all the neighboring country. A drowsy, dreamy 
influence seems to hang over the land, and to pervade the very 
atmosphere. Some say that the place was bewitched by a high 
German doctor, during the early days of the settlement; others, 
that an old Indian chief, the prophet or wizard of his tribe, held 
his pow-wows there before the country was discovered by Master 
Hendrick Hudson. Certain it is, the place still continues under 
the sway of some witching power, that holds a spell over the minds 
of the good people, causing them to walk in a continual reverie. 
They are given to all kinds of marvelous beliefs; are subject to 
trances and visions; and frequently see strange sights, and hear 
music and voices in the air. The whole neighborhood abounds 
with local tales, haunted spots, and twilight superstitions; stars 
shoot and meteors glare oftener across the valley than in any other 
part of the country, and the nightmare, with her whole nine fold, 
seems to make it the favorite scene of her gambols. 
The dominant spirit, however, that haunts this enchanted 
region, and seems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of 
the air, is the apparition of a figure on horseback without a head. 
It is said by some to be the ghost of a Hessian trooper, whose 
head had been carried away by a cannon-ball, in some nameless 
battle during the Revolutionary war; and who is ever and anon 
seen by the country folk, hurrying along in the gloom of night, as 
if on the wings of the wind. His haunts are not confined to the 
valley, but extend at times to the adjacent roads, and especially 
to the vicinity of a church at no great distance. Indeed, certain 
of the most authentic historians of those parts, who have been 
careful in collecting and collating the floating facts. concerning 
this specter, allege that the body of the trooper having been 
buried in the churchyard, the ghost rides forth to the scene of

  battle in nightly quest of his head; and that the rushing speed with 
which he sometimes passes along the Hollow, like a midnight. 
blast, is owing to his being belated, and in a hurry to get back to 
the churchyard before daybreak. 
s Such is the general purport of this legendary superstition, 
which has furnished materials for many a wild story in that region 
of shadows; and the specter is known, at all the country firesides, 
by the name of the Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow. 
It is remarkable that the visionary propensity I have men- 
tioned is not confined to the native inhabitants of the valley, but 
is unconsciously imbibed by every one who resides there for a 
time. However wide awake they may have been before they 
entered that sleepy region, they are sure, in a little time, to inhale 
the witching influence of the air, and begin to grow imaginative— 
to dream dreams, and see apparitions. 
I mention this peaceful spot with all possible laud; for it is in 
such little retired Dutch valleys, found here and there emibosomed 
in the great State of New York, that population, manners, and 
customs remain fixed; while the great torrent of migration and 
improvement, which is making such incessant changes in other 
parts of this restless country, sweeps by them unobserved. They 
are like those little nooks of still water which border a rapid 
stream; where we may see the straw and bubble riding quietly at 
anchor, or slowly revolving in their mimic harbor, undisturbed by 
the rush of the passing current. Though many years have elapsed 
since I trod the drowsy shades of Sleepy Hollow, yet I question 
whether I should not still find the same trees and the same families 
vegetating in its sheltered bosom. = S & 2 s ee & 
ICHABOD CRANE AND KATRINA VAN TASSEL 
In this by-place of nature, there abade, in a remote period of 
30 American history, that is to say, some thirty years since, a worthy 
wight of the name of Ichabod Crane; who sojourned, or, as he 
expressed it, “tarried,” in Sleepy Hollow, for the purpose of in- 
structing :the children of the vicinity. He was a native of Con- 
necticut, a State which supplies the Union with pioneers for the 
% mind as well as for the forest, and sends forth yearly its legions of TELL. 1-17

frontier woodsmen and country school-masters, The cognomen of 
Crane was not inapplicable to his person! He was tall, but ex- 
ceedingly lank, with narrow shoulders, long arms and legs, hands 
.that dangled a mile out of his sleeves, feet that might have served 
+ for shovels, and his whole frame most loosely hung together. His 
head was small, and flat at top, with huge ears, large green glassy 
eyes, and a long snipe nose, so that it looked like a weather-cock, 
perched upon his spindle neck, to tell which way the wind blew. 
To see him striding along the profile of a hill on a windy day, 
40 with his clothes bagging and fluttering about him, one might have 
mistaken him for the genius of famine descending upon the earth, 
or some scarecrow eloped from a cornfield. 
His schoolhouse was a low building of one large room, rudely 
constructed of logs; the windows partly glazed, and partly patched 
4s with leaves of old copy-books. It was most ingeniously secured 
at vacant hours, by a withe twisted in the handle of the door, and 
stakes set against the window shutters; so that, though a thief 
might get in with perfect ease, he would find some embarrassment 
in getting out; an idea most probably borrowed by the architect, 
20 Yost Van Houten, from the mystery of an eel-pot. The school- 
house stood in a rather lonely but pleasant situation, just at the 
foot of a woody hill, with a brook running close by, and a formid- 
* able birch tree growing at one end of it. From hence the low 
murmur of his pupils’ voices, conning over their lessons, might be 
25 heard in a drowsy summer’s day, like the hum of a bee-hive; 
interrupted now and then by the authoritative voice of the master, 
in the tone of menace or command; or, peradventure, by the ap- 
palling sound of the birch, as he urged some. tardy loiterer along 
the flowery path of knowledge. Truth to say, he was a conscien- 
30 tious man, and ever bore in mind the golden maxim, “Spare the 
rod and spoil the child.”—Ichabod Crane’s scholars certainly were 
not spoiled. 
I would not have it imagined, however, that he was one of 
those cruel potentates of the school, who joy in the smart of their 
85 subjects; on the contrary, he administered justice with discrimi- 
nation rather than severity, taking the burthen off the backs of 
the weak and laying it on those of the strong. Your mere puny

stripling, that winced at the least flourish of the rod, was passed 
by with indulgence; but the claims of justice were satisfied by 
inflicting a double portion on some little, tough, wrong-headed, 
broad-skirted Dutch urchin, who sulked and swelled and grew 
5 dogged and sullen beneath the birch. All this he called “doing his 
duty by their parents,” and he never inflicted a chastisement with- 
out following it by the assurance, so consolatory to the smarting 
urchin, that “he would remember it, and thank him for it the 
longest day he had to live.” 
1 When school hours were over, he was even the companion and 
playmate of the larger boys; and on holiday afternoons would 
convoy ‘some of the smaller ones home, who happened to have 
pretty sisters, or good housewives for mothers, noted for the com- 
forts of the cupboard. Indeed it behooved him to keep on good 
15 terms with his pupils. The revenue arising from his school was 
small, and would have been scarcely sufficient to furnish him with 
daily bread, for he was a huge feeder, and, though lank, had the 
dilating powers of an anaconda; but to help out his maintenance, 
he was, according to country custom in those parts, boarded and. 
| 20 lodged at the houses of the farmers whose children he instructed. 
! | i 
  With these he lived successively a week at a time; thus going the 
rounds of the neighborhood, with all his worldly effects tied up 
in a cotton handkerchief. 
That all this might not be too onerous on the purses of his 
23 rustic patrons, who are apt to consider the costs of schooling a 
grievous burden, and schoolmasters as mere drones, he had various 
ways of rendering himself both useful and agreeable. He assisted 
the farmers occasionally in the lighter labors of their farms; 
helped to make hay; mended the fences; took the horses to water; 
30 drove the cows from pasture; and cut wood for the winter fire. 
He laid aside, too, all the dominant dignity and absolute sway 
with which he lorded it in his little empire, the school, and became 
wonderfully gentle and ingratiating. He found favor in the eyes 
of the mothers, by petting the children, particularly the youngest; 
2 and like the lion bold, which whilom so magnanimously the lamb 
did hold, -he would sit with a child on one knee, and rock a eradle 
with his foot for whole hours together.
-P-A-G-E-501
  484 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
In addition te his other vocations, he was the singing-master 
of the neighborhood, and picked up many bright shillings by 
instructing the young folks in psalmody. It was a matter of no 
little vanity to him, on Sundays, to take his station in front of 
5 the church gallery, with a band of chosen singers; where, in his 
own mind, he completely carried away the palm from the parson. 
Certain it is, his voice resounded far above all the rest of the 
congregation; and there are peculiar quavers still to be heard in 
that church, and which may even be heard half a mile off, quite 
10 to the opposite side of the mill-pond, on a still Sunday morning, 
which are said to be legitimately descended from the ‘nose of 
Ichabod Crane. Thus, by divers little makeshifts in that in- 
genious way which is commonly denominated “by hook and by 
crook,” the worthy pedagogue got on tolerably enough, and was 
15 thought, by all who understood nothing of the labor of headwork, 
to have a wonderfully easy life of it. 
The schoolmaster is generally a man of some importance in 
the female circle of a rural neighborhood, being considered a kind 
of idle gentlemanlike personage, of vastly superior taste and ac- 
20 complishments to the rough country swains, and, indeed, inferior 
in learning only to the parson. His appearance, therefore, is apt 
to occasion some little stir at the tea table of a farmhouse, and 
the addition of a supernumerary dish of cakes or sweetmeats, or, 
peradventure, the parade of a silver teapot. Our man of letters, 
2s therefore, was peculiarly happy in the smiles of all the country 
damsels. How he would figure among them in the churchyard, 
between services on Sundays! gathering grapes for them from the 
wild vines that overran the surrounding trees; reciting for their 
amusement all the epitaphs on the tombstones; or sauntering, with 
30 a whole bevy of them, along the banks of the adjacent mill-pond; 
while the more bashful country bumpkins hung sheepishly back, 
envying his superior elegance and address. 
Frem his half itinerant life, also, he was a kind of traveling 
gazette, carrying the whole budget of lecal gossip from house to 
35 house; so that his appearance was always greeted with satisfac- 
tion. He was, moreover, esteemed by the women as a man of 
great erudition, for he had read several beeks quite through, and

  was a perfect master of Cotton Mather’s history of New England 
Witchcraft, in which, by the way, he mest firmly and potently 
believed. . 
He was, in fact, an odd mixture of small shrewdness and simple 
s credulity. His appetite for the marvelous, and his powers of 
digesting it, were equally extraordinary; and both had been in- 
| creased by his resideyce in this ‘spellbound region. No tale was 
too gross or monstrous for his capacious swallow. It was often 
his delight, after his school was dismissed in the afternoon, to 
1 stretch himself on the rich bed of clover, bordering the little brook 
that whimpered by his schoolhouse, and there con over old 
Mather’s direful tales, until the gathering dusk of the evening 
made the printed page a mere mist before his eyes. Then, as he 
wended his way, by swamp and stream and awful woodland, to 
5 the farmhouse where he happened to be quartered, every sound 
of nature, at that witching hour, fluttered his excited imagination: 
the moan of the whippoorwill from the hill-side; the boding cry 
of the tree-toad, that harbinger of storm; the dreary hooting of the 
sereech-owl, or the sudden rustling in the thicket of birds fright~ 
|» ened from their roost. The fire-flies, too, which sparkled most 
vividly in the darkest places, now and then startled him, as one 
of uncommon brightness would stream acrosshis path; and if, by 
chance, a huge blockhead of a beetle came winging his blundering 
| flight against him, the poor varlet was.ready to give up the ghost, 
"3 with the idea that he was struck with a witch’s token. His only 
resource on such occasions, cither to drown thought, or drive away 
evil spirits, was to sing psalm tunes; and the good people of 
Sleepy Hollow, as they sat by their doors of an evening, were 
often filled with awe, at hearing his nasal melody, “in linkéd 
" sweetness long drawn out,” floating from the distant hill, or along 
the dusky road. . 
Another of his sources of fearful pleasure was to pass long 
winter evenings with the old Dutch wives, as they sat spinning by 
the fire, with a row of apples roasting and spluttering along the 
s hearth, and listen to their marvelous tales of ghests and goblins, 
and haunted fields, and haunted brooks, and haunted bridges, and 
haunted houses, and particularly of the headless horseman, or

galloping Hessian of the Hollow, as they sometimes calle him 
He would delight them equally by his anecdotes of witchcraft, 
and of the direful omens and portentous sights and sounds in the 
air, which prevailed in the earlier times of Connecticut; and 
would frighten them woefully with speculations upon comets and 
shooting stars; and with the alarming fact that the world did 
absolutely turn round, and that they were, half the time topsy- 
turvy! : 
But if there was a pleasure in all this, while snugly cuddling in 
the chimney corner of a chamber that was ‘all of a ruddy glow 
from the crackling wood fire, and where, of course, no specter 
dared to show his face, it was dearly purchased by the terrors of 
his subsequent walk homewards. What fearful shapes and 
shadows beset his path amidst the dim and ghastly glare of a 
snowy night!—With what wistful look did he eye every trem- 
bling ray of light streaming across the waste fields from some 
distant window!—How often was he appalled by some shrub 
covered with snow, which, like a sheeted specter, beset his very 
path !—How often did he shrink with curdling awe at the sound of 
his own steps on the frosty crust beneath his feet; and dread to 
look over his shoulder, lest he should behold some uncouth being 
tramping close behind him!—and how often was he thrown into 
complete dismay by some rushing blast, howling among the trees, 
in the idea that it was the Galloping Hessian on one of his nightly 
scourings! . 
All these, however, were mere terrors of the night, phantoms 
of the mind that walk in darkness; and though he had seen many 
specters in his time, and been more than once beset by Satan in 
divers shapes, in his lonely perambulations, yet daylight put an 
end to all these evils; and he would have passed a pleasant life of 
it, in despite of the devil and all his works, if his path had not 
been crossed by a being that causes more perplexity to mortal 
man than ghosts, goblins, and the whole race of witches put to- 
gether, and that was—a woman. 
Among the musical disciples who assembled, one evening in 
each week, to receive his instructions in psalmody, was Katrina 
Van Tassel, the daughter and only child of a substantial Dutch
-P-A-G-E-504

farmer. She was a blooming lass of fresh eighteen; plump as a 
partridge; ripe and melting and rosy cheeked as one of her 
father’s peaches; and universally famed, not merely for her 
beauty, but her vast expectations. She was withal a little of a 
5 coquette, as might be perceived even in her dress, which was a 
mixture of ancient and modern fashions, as most suited to set off 
[ her charms. She wore the ornaments of pure yellow gold, which 
her great-great-grandmother had brought over from Saardam; 
the tempting stomacher of the olden time; and withal a provok- 
10 ingly short petticoat, to display the prettiest foot and ankle in 
the country round. 
Ichabod Crane had a soft. and foolish heart toward the sex; 
and it is not to be wondered at that so tempting a morsel soon 
found favor in his eyes, more especially after he had visited her 
15 in her paternal mansion. Old Baltus Van Tassel was a perfect 
picture of a thriving, contented, liberal-hearted farmer. He 
seldom, it is true, sent either his eyes or his thoughts beyond the 
boundaries of his own farm; but within those every thing was 
snug, happy, and well-conditioned. He was satisfied with his 
20 wealth, but not proud of it; and piqued himself upon the hearty 
abundance, rather than the style in which he lived. His strong- 
hold was situated on the banks of the Hudson, in one of those 
green, sheltered, fertile nooks, in which the Dutch farmers are so 
fond of nestling. A great elm-tree spread its broad branches over 
% it; at the foot of which bubbled up a spring of the softest and 
sweetest water, in a little well, formed of a barrel; and then stole 
sparkling away through the grass, to a neighboring brook, that: 
bubbled along among alders and dwarf willows. Hard by the 
farmhouse was a vast barn, that might have served for a church; 
| 9 every window and crevice of which seemed bursting forth with 
the treasures of the farm; the flail was busily resounding within. 
| it from morning to night; swallows and martins skimmed twitter- 
ing about the eaves; and rows of pigeons, some with one eye 
turned up, as if watching the weather, some with their heads 
35 under their wings or buried in their bosoms, and others swelling, 
and cooing. and bowing about their dames, were enjoying the 
sunshine on the roof. Sleek unwieldy porkers were grunting in

the repose and abundance of their pens, whence sallied forth, now 
and then, troops of sucking pigs, as if to snuff the air. A stately 
squadron of snowy geese were riding in an adjoining pond, con- 
voying whole fleets of ducks; regiments of turkeys were gobbling 
through the farmyard, and guinea fowls fretting about it, like ill- 
tempered housewives, with their peevish discontented cry. Before 
the barn door strutted the gallant cock, that pattern of a husband, 
a warrior, and a fine gentleman, clapping his burnished wings, 
and crowing in the pride and gladness of his heart—sometimes 
tearing up the earth with his feet, and then generously calling his 
ever-hungry family of wives and children to enjoy the rich morsel 
which he had discovered. 
The pedagogue’s mouth watered, as he looked upon this sump- 
tuous promise of luxurious winter fare. In his devouring mind’s 
eye he pictured to himself every roasting-pig running about with 
a pudding in his belly, and an apple in his mouth; the pigeons 
were snugly put to bed in a comfortable pie, and tucked ‘in with a 
coverlet of crust; the geese were swimming in their own gravy; 
and the ducks pairing cozily in dishes, like snug married couples, 
with a decent competency of onion sauce. In the porkers he saw 
carved. out the future sleek side of bacon, and juicy relishing ham; 
not a turkey but he beheld daintily trussed up,. with its gizzard 
under its wing, and peradventure, a necklace of savory sausages; 
and even bright chanticleer himself lay sprawling on his back, in 
a side-dish, with uplifted claws, as if craving that quarter which 
his chivalrous spirit disdained to ask while living. 
As the enraptured Ichabod fancied all this, and as he rolled 
his great green eyes over the fat meadow-lands, the rich fields of 
wheat, of rye, of buckwheat, and Indian corn, and the orchards 
burthened with ruddy fruit which surrounded the warm tenement 
of Van Tassel, his heart yearned after the damsel who was to 
inherit these domains, and his imagination expanded with the idea, 
how they might be readily turned into cash, and the money in- 
vested in immense tracts of wild land, and shingle palaces in the 
wilderness. Nay, his busy fancy already realized his hopes, and 
presented to him the blooming Katrina, with a whole family of 
children, mounted on the top of a wagon loaded with household

| trumpery, with pots and kettles dangling. beneath; and he beheld 
himself bestriding a pacing mare, with a colt at her heels, setting 
out for Kentucky, Tennessee, or the Lord knows where. 
When he entered the house the conquest of his heart was com- 
5 plete. It was one of those spacious farmhouses, with high-ridged, 
but lowly-sloping roofs, built in the style handed down from the 
f first Dutch settlers; the low projecting eaves forming a piazza 
along the front, capable of being closed up in bad weather. Under 
this were hung flails, harness, various utensils of husbandry, and 
io nets for fishing in the neighboring river. Benches were built 
along the sides for summer use; and a great spinning-wheel. at 
one end, and a churn at the other, showed the various uses to 
{ which this important porch might be devoted.’ From this piazza 
the wondering Ichabod entered the hall, which formed the center 
15 of the mansion and the place of usual residence. Here rows of 
resplendent pewter, ranged on a long dresser, dazzled his eyes. 
In one corner stood a huge bag of wool ready to be spun; in an- 
other a quantity of linsey-woolsey just from the loom; ears of 
Indian corn, and strings of dried apples and peaches, hung in gay 
0 festoons along the walls, mingled with the gaud of red peppers; 
and a door left ajar gave him a peep into the best parlor, where 
the claw-footed chairs and dark mahogany tables shone like 
mirrors; and irons, with their accompanying shovel and tongs, 
glistened from their covert of asparagus tops; mock-oranges and 
5 conch-shells decorated the mantelpiece; strings of various colored 
birds’.eggs were suspended above it; a great ostrich egg was hung 
from,the center of the room; and a corner cupboard, knowingly 
| left open, displayed immense treasures of old silver and well- 
mended china. 
so From the moment Ichabod laid his eyes upon these regions of 
| delight the peace of his mind was at an end, and his only study 
was low to gain the affections of the peerless daughter of Van 
Tassel. In this enterprise, however, he had more real difficulties 
| than generally fell to the lot of a knight-errant ‘of yore, who 
3 seldom had anything but giants, enchanters, fiery dragons, and 
such like easily-conquered adversaries, to contend with; and had

walls of adamant, to the castle keep, where the lady of his heart 
was confined, all which he achieved as easily as a man would 
carve his way to the center of a Christmas pie; and then the lady 
gave him her hand as a matter of course. Ichabod, on the con- 
trary, had to win his way to the heart of a country coquette, beset 
with a labyrinth of whims and caprices, which were forever pre- 
senting new difficulties and impediments; and he had to encounter 
a host of fearful adversaries of real flesh and blood, the numerous 
rustic admirers, who beset every portal to her heart; keeping a 
watchful and angry eye upon each other, but ready to fly out in 
the common cause against any new competitor. 
BROM BONES 
Among these the most formidable was 4 burly, roaring, roys- 
tering blade, of the name of Abraham, or, according to the Dutch 
abbreviation, Brom Van Brunt, the hero of the country round, 
which rang with his feats of strength and hardihood. He was 
broad-shouldered and double-jointed, with short curly black hair, 
and a bluff but not unpleasant countenance, having a mingled air 
of fun and arrogance. From his Herculean frame and great 
powers of limb, he had received the nickname of Brom Bonss, 
by which he was universally known. He was famed for great 
knowledge and skill in horsemanship, being as dexterous on horse- 
back as a Tartar. He was foremost at all races and cock-fights; 
and, with the ascendency which bodily strength acquires in rustic 
life, was the umpire in all disputes, setting his hat on one side, 
and giving his decisions with an air and tone admitting of no 
gaimsay or appeal. He was always ready for either a fight or a 
frolic; but had more mischief than ill-will in his composition; 
and, with all his overbearing roughness, there was a strong dash 
of waggish good humor at bottom. He had three or four boon 
companions, who regarded him as their model, and at the head of 
whom he scoured the country, attending every scene of feud or 
merriment for miles round. In cold weather he was distinguished 
by a fur cap, surmounted with a flaunting fox’s tail; and when the 
folks at a country gathering descried this well-known crest at a 
distance, whisking about among a squad of hard riders, they

|= always stood by for a squall. Sometimes his crew would be 
heard dashing along past the farmhouses at midnight, with whoop 
and halloo, like a troop of Don Cossacks; and the old dames, 
startled out of their sleep, would listen for a moment. till the 
5 hurry-scurry had clattered by, and then exclaim, “Ay, there goes 
{ Brom Bones and his gang!” The neighbors looked upon him with 
a mixture of awe, admiration, and good will; and when any mad- 
cap prank or rustic brawl occurred in the vicinity, always shook 
their heads, and warranted Brom Bones was at the bottom of it. 
10 ‘This rantipole hero had for some time singled out the blooming 
Katrina for the object of his uncouth gallantries, and though his 
amorous toyings were something like the gentle caresses and 
endearments of a bear, yet it was whispered that she did not alto- 
gether discourage his hopes. Certain it is, his advances were 
1 signals for rival candidates to retire, who felt no inclination to 
cross a lion in his amours; insomuch, that when his horse was seen 
tied to Van Tassel’s paling, on a Sunday night, a sure sign that 
‘his master was courting, or, as it is termed, “sparking,” within, all 
other suitors passed by in despair, and carried the war into other 
20 quarters. 
Such was the formidable rival with whom Ichabod Crane had 
to contend, and, considering all things, a stouter man than he 
would have shrunk from the competition, and a.wiser man would 
have despaired. He had, however, a happy: mixture of pliability 
25 and perseverance in his nature; he was in form and spirit like a 
supple-jack—yielding, but tough; though he bent, he never broke; 
and though he bowed beneath the slightest pressure, yet, the mo- 
ment it was away—jerk! he was as erect, and carried his head as 
high as ever. . 
\° To have taken the ficld openly against his rival would have 
been madness; for he was not a man to be thwarted in his amours, 
any more than that stormy lover, Achilles. Ichabod, therefore, 
made his advances in a quiet and gently-insinuating manner. 
Under cover of his character of singing-master, he made frequent 
s visits at the farmhouse; not that he had anything to apprehend 
from the meddlesome interference of parents, which is so often a 
stumbling-block in the path of lovers. Balt Van Tassel was an

easy, indulgent soul; he loved his daughter better even than his 
pipe, and, like a reasonable man and an excellent father, let her 
have her way in everything. His notable little wife, too, ~ 
enough to do to attend to her housekeeping and manage 
poultry; for, as she sagely observed, ducks and geese are foususu 
things, and must be looked after, but girls can take care of them- 
selves. Thus while the busy dame bustled about the house, or 
plied her spinning-wheel at one end of the piazza, honest Balt 
would sit smoking his evening pipe at the other, watching the 
achievements of a little wooden warrior, who, armed with a sword 
in each hand, was most valiantly fighting the wind on the pin- 
nacle of the barn. In the meantime, Ichabod would carry on his 
suit with the daughter by the side of the spring under the great 
elm, or sauntering along in the twilight, that hour so favorable to 
the lover's eloquence. 
I profess not to know how women’s hearts are wooed and won. 
To me they have always been matters of riddle and admiration. 
Some seem to have but one vulnerable point, or door of access; 
while others have a thousand avenues, and may be captured in a 
thousand different ways. It is a great triumph of skill to gain 
the former, but a still greater proof of generalship to maintain 
possession of the latter, for the man must battle for his fortress at 
every door and window. He who wins a thousand common hearts 
is therefore entitled to some renown; but he who keeps undisputed 
sway over the heart of a coquette is indeed a hero. Certain it is, 
this was not the case with the redoubtable Brom Bones; and from 
the moment Ichabod Crane made his advances, the’ interests of 
the former evidently declined; his horse was no longer seen tied 
at the palings on Sunday nights, and a deadly feud gradually 
arose between him and the preceptor of Sleepy Hollow. 
Brom, who had a degree of rough chivalry in his nature, would 
fain have carried matters to open warfare, and have settled their 
pretensions to the lady, according to the mode of those most con- 
cise and simple reasoners, the knights-errant of yore—by single 
combat; but. Ichabod was tea conscious of the superior might of 
his adversary to enter the lists against him; he had overheard a 
beast of Bones, that he would “double the schoolmaster up, and
-P-A-G-E-510

  | lay him on a shelf of his own schoolhouse”; and he was too wary 
te give him an opportunity. There was something extremely pro- 
voking in this obstinately pacific system; it left Brom no alterna-_. 
tive but to draw upon the funds of rustic waggery in his dis- 
5 position, and to play off boorish practical jokes upon his rival. 
Ichabod became the object of whimsical persecution to Bones and 
his gang of rough riders. They harried his hitherto peaceful 
domains; smoked out his singing school, by stopping up the 
chimney; broke into the schoolhouse at night, in spite of its 
10 formidable fastenings of withe and window stakes, and turned 
everything topsy-turvy; so that the poor schoolmaster began to 
think all the witches of the country held their meetings there. 
But what was still more annoying, Brom took all. opportunities 
of turning him into ridicule in presence of his mistress, and had 
8 a scoundrel dog whom he taught to whine in the most ludicrous 
manner, and introduced as a rival of Ichabod’s to instruct her in 
psalmody. 
THE QUILTING FROLIC 
In this way matters went.on for some time, without producing 
any material effect on the relative situation of the contending 
2 powers. ‘ On a fine autumnal afternoon, Ichabod, in pensive mood, 
sat enthroned on the lofty stool whence he usually watched all 
the concerns of his little literary realm. In his hand he swayed a 
ferrule, that scepter of despotic power; the birch of justice reposed 
on three nails, behind the throne, a constant terror to evil doers; 
2s while on the desk before him might be seen sundry contraband 
articles and prohibited weapons, detected upon the persons ef 
idle urchins; such as half-munched apples, popguns, whirligigs, 
| fly-cages, and whole legions of rampant little paper game-cocks. 
Apparently there had been some appalling act of justice recently 
30 inflicted, for his scholars were all busily intent upon their books, 
or slyly whispering behind them with one eye kept upon the 
master; and a kind of buzzing stillness reigned throughout the 
schoolroom. It was suddenly interrupted by the appearance of 
a negro, in tow-cloth jacket and trousers, a round-crowned frag- 
% ment of a hat, like the cap of Mercury, and mounted on the back ee
-P-A-G-E-511

of a ragged, wild, half-broken colt,,which he managed with a 
rope by way of halter. He came clattering up to the school door 
with an ‘invitation to Ichabod to attend a merry-making or 
' “quilting frolic,” to be held that evening at Mynheer Van Tassel’s; oO

& and having delivered his message with that air of importance, and 
effort at fine language, which a negro is apt to display on petty 
embassies of the kind, he dashed over the brook, and was seen 
scampering away up the hollow, full of the importance and hurry 
of his mission. 
All was now bustle and hubbub in the late quiet schoolroom. 
The scholars were hurried through their lessons, without stopping 
at trifles; those who were nimble skipped over half with impunity, 
and those who were tardy had a smart application now and then 
in the rear to quicken their speed or help them over a tall word. 
Books were flung aside without being put away on the shelves, 
inkstands were over-turned, benches thrown down, and the whole 
school was turned loose an hour before the usual time, bursting 
forth like a legion of young imps, yelping and racketing about the 
green, in joy of their early emancipation. - 
The gallant Ichabod now spent at least an extra half hour at 
his toilet, brushing and furbishing up his best, and indeed only, 
suit of rusty black, and arranging his locks by a bit of broken 
looking-glass, that hung up in the schoolhouse. That he might 
make his appearance before his mistress in the true style of a 
cavalier he borrowed.a horse from the farmer with whom he was 
domiciled, a choleric old Dutchman, of the name of Hans Van 
Ripper, and, thus gallantly mounted, issued forth, like a knight- 
errant, in quest of adventures. But it is meet I should, in the true 
spirit of romantic story, give some account of the looks and 
equipments of my hero and his steed. The animal he bestrode was 
a broken-down plow-horse, that had outlived almost everything 
but his viciousness. He was gaunt and shagged, with a ewe neck 
and a head like a hammer; his rusty mane and tail were tangled 
and knotted with burs; one eye had lost its pupil and was glaring 
and spectral; but the other had the gleam of a genuine devil in it. 
Still he must have had fire and mettle in his day, if we may judge 
from the name he bore of Gunpowder. He had, in fact, been a
-P-A-G-E-512
le 2 2 
& 3 a we 3 
  SS # a The. Legend of Sleepy Hollow 495   
favorite steed of his master’s, the choleric Van Ripper, who was 
a furious rider, and had infused, very probably, some of his own 
spirit into the animal; for, old and broken-down as he looked, 
there was more of the lurking devil in him than in any young filly 
in the country. 
Ichabod was a suitable figure for such a steed. He rode with 
short stirrups, which brought his knees nearly up to the pommel 
of the saddle; his sharp elbows stuck out like grasshoppers; he 
carried his whip perpendicularly in his hand, like a scepter, and, 
as his horse jogged on, the motion of his arms was not unlike the 
flapping of a pair of wings. A small wool hat rested on the top 
of his nose, for so his scanty strip of forehead might be called; 
and the skirts of his black coat fluttered out almost to the horse's 
tail. Such was the appearance of Ichabod and his steed, as they 
shambled out of the gate of Hans Van Ripper, and it was alto- 
gether such an apparition as is seldom to be met with in broad 
daylight. . 
It was, as I have said, a fine autumnal day, the sky was clear 
and serene, and nature wore that rich and golden livery which we 
always associate with the idea of abundance. The forests had put 
on their sober brown and yellow, while some trees of the tenderer 
kind had been nipped by the frosts into brilliant dyes of orange, 
purple, and scarlet. Streaming files of wild ducks began to make 
their appearance high in the air; the bark of the squirrel might be 
heard from the groves of beech and hickory nuts, and the pensive 
whistle of the quail at intervals from the neighboring stubble- - 
field. . 
The small birds were taking their farewell banquets. In the 
fullness of their revelry they fluttered, chirping and frolicking, 
from bush to bush, and tree to tree, capricious from the very. pro- 
fusion and variety around them. There was the honest cock- 
robin, the favorite game of stripling sportsmen, with its loud 
querulous note, and the twittering blackbirds ‘flying in sable 
clouds; and the golden-winged woodpecker, with his crimson crest, 
his broad black gorget, and splendid plumage; and the cedar bird, 
with its red-tipt wings and yellow-tipt tail, and its little mon- 
tero cap of feathers; and the blue-jay, that noisy coxcomb, in his
-P-A-G-E-513
    496 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
gay light-blue coat and white underclothes, screaming and chat- 
tering, nodding and bobbing and bowing, and pretending to be on 
good terms with every songster of the grove. 
As Ichabod jogged slowly on his way, his eye, ever open to 
every symptom of culinary abundance, ranged with delight over 
the treasures of jolly autumn. On all sides he beheld vast store 
of apples; some hanging in oppressive opulence on the trees; some 
gathered into baskets and barrels for the market; others heaped 
up in rich piles for the cider-press. Farther on he beheld great 
fields of Indian corn, with its golden ears peeping from their 
leafy coverts, and holding out the promise of cakes and hasty 
pudding; and the yellow pumpkins lying beneath them, turning 
up their fair round bellies to the sun, and giving ample prospects 
of the most luxurious of pies; and anon he passed the fragrant 
buckwheat fields, breathing the odor of the bee-hive, and as he 
beheld them, soft anticipations stole over his mind of dainty slap- 
jacks, well buttered, and garnished with honey or.treacle, by the 
delicate little dimpled hand of Katrina Van Tassel. 
Thus feeding his mind with many sweet thoughts and “sugared 
20 suppositions,” he journeyed along the sides of a range of hills 
which look out upon some of the goodliest scenes of the mighty 
Hudson. The sun-gradually wheeled his broad disk down into 
the west. The wide bosom of the Tappan Zee lay motionless and 
glassy, excepting that here and there a gentle undulation waved 
and prolonged the blue shadow of the distant mountain. A few 
amber clouds floated in the sky, without a breath of air to move 
them. The horizon was of a fine golden tint, changing gradually 
into a pure apple green, and from that into the deep blue of the 
mid-heaven. A slanting ray lingered on the woody crests of the 
30 precipices that overhung some parts of the river, giving greater 
depth to the dark-gray and purple of their rocky sides. A sloop 
was loitering in the distance, dropping slowly down with the tide, 
her sail hanging uselessly against the mast, and as the reflection 
of the sky gleamed along the still water, it seemed as if the vessel 
85 was suspended in the air. 
It was toward evening that Ichabod arrived at the castle of 
the Heer Van Tassel, which he found thronged with the pride e ~ m &

and flower of the adjacent country. Old farmers, a spare, leath- 
emn-faced race, in homespun coats and breeches, blue stockings, 
huge shoes, and magnificent pewter buckles. Their brisk with- 
ered little dames, in close crimped caps, long waisted short-gowns, 
5 homespun petticoats, with scissors and pincushions, and gay calico 
pockets hanging on the. outside. Buxom lasses, almost as anti- 
quated as their mothers, excepting .where a ‘straw hat, a fine 
ribbon, or perhaps a white frock, gave symptoms of city innova- 
tion. The sons, in short square-skirted coats with rows of stu- 
1 pendous brass buttons, and their hair generally queued in the 
fashion of the times, especially if they could procure an eel-skin 
for the purpose, it being esteemed.throughout the country, as a 
potent nourisher and strengthener of the hair. 
Brom Bones, however, was the hero of the scene, having come 
1s to the gathering on his favorite steed, Daredevil, a creature, like 
himself, full of mettle and mischief, and which no one but him- 
self could. manage. He was, in fact, noted for preferring vicious 
animals, given to all kinds of tricks, which kept the rider in con- 
stant risk of his neck, for he held a tractable well-broken horse as 
ko unworthy of a lad of spirit. 
Fain would I pause to dwell upon the world of charms that 
burst upon the enraptured gaze of my hero, as he entered the state 
parlor of Van Tassel’s mansion. Not those of the bevy of buxom 
lasses, with their luxurious display of red and white; but the 
2s ample charms of a genuine Dutch country tea-table, in the sump- 
tuous time of autumn. Such heaped-up platters of cakes of vari- 
ous-and almost indescribable kinds, known only to experienced 
Dutch housewives! There was the doughty doughnut, the ten- 
derer oly koek, and the crisp’ and crumbling cruller;. sweet cakes 
30 and short cakes, ginger cakes and honey cakes, and the whole 
family of cakes. And then there were apple pies and peach pies 
and pumpkin pies; besides slices of ham and smoked beef; and 
moreover: delectable dishes of preserved plums, and peaches, and 
pears, and quinces, not to mention broiled shad and roasted 
35 chickens; together with bowls of milk and cream, all mingled 
higgledy-piggledy, pretty much as I have enumerated them, with 
the. motherly teapot sending up its clouds of vapor from the

  midst-—Heaven bless the mark! I want breath and time 
cuss this banquet as it deserves, and am too eager to get ¢ 
my story. Happily, Ichabod Crane was not in so great : 
as his historian, but did ample justice to every dainty. 
He was a kind and thankful creature, whose heart di’ ' 
proportion as his skin was filled with good cheer; anc 
spirits rose with eating as some men’s do with drink. EI 
not help, too, rolling his large eyes round him as he a 
chuckling with the possibility that he might one day be 
all this scene of almost unimaginable luxury and splendor. 
he thought, how soon he’d turn his back upon the old suuuw.- 
house, snap his fingers in the face of Hans Van Ripper, and every 
other niggardly patron, and kick any itinerant pedagogue out of 
doors that should dare to call him comrade. 
Old Baltus Van Tassel moved about among his guests with a 
face dilated with content and good humor, round and jolly as the 
harvest moon. His hospitable attentions were brief, but expres- 
sive, being confined to a shake of the hand, a slap on the shoulder, 
a loud laugh, and a pressing invitation to fall to, and help them- 
selves. , 
And now the sound of the music from the common room, or 
hall, summoned to the dance. The musician was an old gray- 
headed negro, who had been the itinerant orchestra of the neigh- 
borhood for more than half a century. His instrument was as old 
and battered as himself. The greater part of the time he scraped 
on two or three strings, accompanying every movement of the 
bow with a motion of the head, bowing almost to the ground, 
and stamping with his foot whenever a fresh couple were to 
start. , 
Ichabod prided himself upon his dancing as much as upon his 
vocal powers: Not a limb, not a fiber about him was idle; and to 
have seen his loosely hung frame in full motion, and clattering 
about the room, you would have thought Saint Vitus himself, 
that blessed patron of the dance, was figuring before you in person. 
He was the admiration of all the negroes, who, having gathered, 
cf all ages and sizes, from the farm and the neighborhood, stood 
forming a pyramid of shining black faces at every door and

window, gazing with delight at the scene, rolling their white eye- ° 
balls, and showing grinning rows of ivory from ear to ear. How 
could the flogger of urchins be otherwise than animated and 
joyous? The lady of his heart was his partner in the dance, and 
smiling graciously in reply to all his amorous oglings; while Brom 
Bones, sorely smitten with love and jealousy, sat brooding by 
himself in one corner. 
When the dance was at an end, Ichabod was attracted to a 
knot of the sager folks, who, with old Van Tassel, sat smoking at 
one end of the piazza, gossiping over former times, and drawing 
out long stories about the war. 
This neighborhood, at the time of which I am speaking, was 
one of those highly-favored places which abound with chronicle 
and great men. The British and American line had run near it 
during the war; it had, therefore, been the scene of marauding, 
and infested with refugees, cowboys, and all kinds of border 
chivalry. Just sufficient time had elapsed to enable each story- 
teller to dress up his tale with a little becoming fiction, and, in 
the indistinctness of his recollection, to make himself the hero of 
Es every exploit. 
There was the story of Doffue Martling, a large blue-bearded 
Dutchman, who had nearly taken a British frigate with an old 
iron nine-pounder from a mud breastwork, only that his gun burst 
at the sixth discharge. And there was an old gentleman who 
shall be nameless, being too rich a mynheer to be lightly men- 
tioned, who, in the battle of Whiteplains, being an excellent master 
of defense, parried a musket ball with a small sword, insomuch 
that he absolutely felt it whiz around the blade, and glance off 
at the hilt; in proof of which he was ready at any time to show 
the sword with the hilt a little bent. There were several more 
that had been equally great in the field, not one of whom but was 
persuaded that he had a considerable hand in bringing the war to 
a happy termination. 
But all these were nothing to the tales of ghosts and appari- 
tions that succeeded. The neighborhood is rich in legendary 
treasures of the kind. Local tales and superstitions thrive best 
in these sheltered long-settled retreats, but are trampled under
-P-A-G-E-517
a

  foot by the shifting throng that forms the population of most of 
our ceuntry places. Besides, there is no encouragement for 
ghosts in most of our villages, for they have scarcely had time to 
finish their first nap, and turn themselves in their graves, before 
their surviving friends have traveled away from the neighbor- 
hood; so that when they turn out at night to walk their rounds 
they have no acquaintance left to call upon. This is perhaps the 
reason why we so seldom hear of ghosts except j in our long-estab- 
lished Dutch communities. 
The immediate cause, however, of the prevalence of super- 
natural stories in these parts was doubtless owing to the vicinity 
of Sleepy Hollow. There was a contagion in the very air that 
blew from that haunted region; it breathed forth an atmosphere 
of dreams and fancies infecting all the land. Several of the Sleepy 
Hollow people were present at Van Tassel’s, and, as usual, were 
doling out their wild and wonderful legends. Many dismal tales 
were told about funeral trains, and mourning cries and wailings 
heard and seen about the great tree where the unfortunate Major 
André was taken, and which stood m the neighborhood. Some 
mention was made also of the woman in white, that haunted the 
dark glen at Raven Rock, and was often heard to shriek on winter 
nights before a storm, having perished there in the snow. The 
chief part of the stories, however, turned upon the favorite specter 
of Sleepy Hollow, the headless horseman, who had been heard 
several times of late, patrolling the country; and, it was said, 
tethered his horse nightly among the graves in the churchyard. 
The sequestered situation of this church seems always to have 
made it a favorite haunt of troubled spirits. It stands on a knoll, 
surrounded by locust-trees and lofty elms, from among which its 
decent whitewashed walls shine modestly forth, like Christian 
purity beaming through the shades of retirement. A gentle slope 
descends from it to a silver sheet of water, bordered by high trees, 
between which peeps may be caught at the blue hills of the 
Hudson. To look upon its grass-grown yard, where the sunbeams 
seem to sleep so quietly, one would think that there at least the 
dead might rest in peace. On one side of the church extends a 
wide woody dell, along which raves a large brook among broken  
-P-A-G-E-518
  The Legend of Sleepy Hollow 501 
| rocks and trunks of fallen trees. Over a deep black part of the 
stream, not far from the church, was formerly thrown a wooden 
bridge; the road that led to it, and the bridge itself, were thickly 
shaded by overhanging trees, which cast a gloom about it, even 
s in the daytime; but occasioned a fearful darkness at night. This 
was one of the favorite haunts of the headless horseman and the 
{lace where he was most frequently encountered. The tale was 
told of old Brouwer, a most heretical disbeliever in ghosts, how he 
met the horseman returning from his foray into Sleepy Hollow, 
i0 and was obliged to get up behind him; how they galloped over 
bush and brake, over hill and swamp, until they reached the 
bridge, when the horseman suddenly turned into a skeleton, threw 
old Brouwer into the brook, and sprang away over the tree-tops 
ae a clap of thunder. 
This story was immediately matched by a thrice marvelous 
adventure of Brom Bones, who-made light of the galloping Hes- 
sian as an arrant jockey. He affirmed that, on. returning one 
night from the neighboring village of Sing Sing, he had been over- 
taken by this midnight trooper; that he had offered to race with 
0 him for a bowl of punch, and should have won it, too, for Dare- 
devil beat the goblin horse all hollow, but, just as they came to 
the church bridge, the Hessian bolted, and vanished in a flash 
of fire, 
All these tales, told in that drowsy undertone with which men 
5 talk in the dark, the countenances of the listeners only now and 
then receiving a casual gleam from the glare of a pipe, sank deep 
in the mind of Ichabod. He repaid them in kind with large — 
extracts from his invaluable author, Cotton Mather, and added 
many marvelous events that had taken place in his native State 
f of Connecticut, and fearful sights which he had seen in his nightly 
walks about Sleepy Hollow. 
| The revel now gradually broke up. The old farmers gathered 3 
together their families in their wagons, and were heard for some 
time rattling along the hollow roads, and over the distant hills. 
* Some of the damsels mounted on pillions behind their favorite 
swains, and their light-hearted laughter, mingling with the clatter 
of hoofs, echoed along the silent woodlands, sounding fainter and

  fainter until they gradually died away—and the late sce: 
noise and frolic was all silent and deserted. Ichabod only

ICHABOD’S TERRIFYING EXPERIENCES 
It was the very witching time of night that Ichabod, 
hearted and crestfallen, pursued his travel homewards, a, __ 
sides of the lofty hills which rise above Tarry Town, and which 
he had traverséd so cheerily in the afternoon. The hour was as 
25 dismal as himself. Far below him, the Tappan Zce spread its 
dusky and indistinct waste of waters, with here and (" so

a dreaming sound in his ear. No signs of life occurred near him,

guttural twang of a bull-frog, from a neighboring marsh, as if 
sleeping uncomfortably, and turning suddenly in his bed. 
All the stories of ghosts and goblins that he had heard in the 
afternoon now came crowding upon his recollection. The night 
5 grew darker and darker; the stars seemed to sink deeper in the 
sky, and driving clouds occasionally hid them from his sight. He 
had never felt so lonely and dismal. He was, moreover, approach- 
ing the very place where many of the scenes of the ghost stories 
had been laid. In the center of the road stood an enormous tulip 
10 tree, which towered like a giant’ above all the other trees of the 
neighborhood, and formed a kind of landmark. Its limbs were 
gnarled, and fantastic, large enough to form trunks for ordinary 
trees, twisting down almost to the earth, and rising again intc 
the air. It was connected with the tragical story of the unfor- 
1s tunate André, who had been taken prisoner hard by, and was 
universally known by the name of Major André’s tree. The 
“common people regarded it with a mixture of respect and super- 
stition, partly out of sympathy for the fate of its ill-starred name- 
sake, and partly from the tales of strange sights and doteful 
ke lamentations told concerning it. 
As Ichabod approached this fearful tree, he began to whistle; 
he thought his whistle was answered—it was but a blast sweeping 
sharply through the dry branches. As he approached: a little 
nearer he thought he saw something white hanging in the midst of 
ss the tree—he paused and ceased whistling; but on looking more 
narrowly perceived that it was a place where the tree had been 
seathed by lightning, and the white Wood laid bare. Suddenly he 
heard a groan—his teeth chattered and his knees smote against, 
the saddle; it was but the rubbing of one huge bough upon an- 
30 other, as they were swayed about by the breeze. He passed the 
‘tree in safety, but new perils lay before him. 
| About two hundred yards from the tree a small brook crossed 
—_ 
the road and ran into a marshy and thickly-wooded glen, known 
by the name of Wiley’s swamp. A few rough logs, laid side by 
% side, served for a bridge over this stream. On that side of the 
toad where the brook entered the wood a group of oaks and chestnuts, matted thick with wild grapevines, threw a cavernous

gloom over it. To pass this bridge was the severest trial. It was 
at this identical spot that the unfortunate André was captured, 
and under the covert of those chestnuts and vines were the sturdy 
yeomen concealed who surprised him. This has ever since been 
5 considered a haunted stream, and fearful are the feelings of the 
schoolboy who has to pass it alone after dark. 
As he approached the stream his heart began to thump; he 
summoned up, however, all his resolution, gave his horse half a 
score of kicks in the ribs, and attempted to dash briskly across 
1o the bridge; but instead of starting forward, the perverse old 
animal made a lateral movement, and ran broadside against the 
fence. Ichabod, whose fears increased with the delay, jerked the 
reins on the other side and kicked lustily with the contrary foot; 
it was all in vain; his steed started, it is true, but it was only to 
15 plunge to the opposite side of the road into a thicket of brambles 
and alder bushes. The schoolmaster now bestowed both whip and 
heel upon the starveling ribs of old Gunpowder, who dashed for- 
ward, snuffing and snorting, but came to a stand just by the 
bridge, with a suddenness that had nearly sent his rider sprawling 
20 over his head. Just at this moment a plashy tramp by the side 
of the bridge caught the sensitive ear of Ichabod. In the dark 
shadow of the grove, on the margin of the brook, he beheld some- 
thing huge, misshapen, black, and towering. It stirred not, but 
seemed gathered up in the gloom, like some gigantic monster ready 
25 to spring upon the traveler. 
The hair of the affrighted pedagogue rose upon his head with 
terror. What was to be done? To turn and fly was now too late; 
and besides, what chance was there of escaping ghost or goblin, 
if such it was, which could ride upon the wings of the wind? 
30 Summoning up, therefore, a show of courage, he demanded in 
stammering accents—‘Who are you?” He received noreply. He 
repeated his demand in a still more agitated voice. Still there 
was no answer. Once more he cudgelled the sides of the inflexible 
Gunpowder, and, shutting his eyes, broke forth with involuntary 
88 fervor into a psalm tune. Just then the shadowy object of alarm 
put itself in motion, and, with a scramble and a bound, stood at 
once in the middle of the road. Though the night was dark and

dismal, yet the form of the unknown might now in some degree 
be ascertained. He appeared to be a horseman of large dimen- 
sions, and mounted on a black horse of powerful frame. He 
made no offer of molestation or sociability, but kept aloof on one 
6 side of the road, jogging along on the blind side of old Gunpowder, 
who had now got over his fright and waywardness. 
( Ichabod, who had no relish for this strange midnight com- 
panion; and bethought himself of the adventure of Brom Bones 
with the Galloping Hessian, now quickened his steed, in hopes of 
io leaving him behind. The stranger, however, quickened his horse 
| to an equal pace. Ichabod pulled up and fell into a walk, think- 
ing to lag behind—the other did the same. His heart began to 
sink within him; he endeavored to resume his psalm tune, but 
his parched tongue clove to the roof of his mouth, and he could 
8 not utter a stave. There was something in the moody and dogged 
silence of this pertinacious companion that was mysterious and 
appalling. It was soon fearfully accounted for. On mounting a 
rising ground, which brought the figure of his fellow-traveler in 
relief against the sky, gigantic in height, and muffled in a cloak, 
0 Ichabod was horror struck, on perceiving that he was headless! 
~but his horror was still more increased, on observing that the 
head, which should have rested on his shoulders, was carried 
peration; he rained a shower of kicks and blows upon Gunpowder, 
hoping, by a sudden movement, to give his companion the slip— 
but the specter started full jump with him. Away then they 
dashed through thick and thin; stones flying, and sparks flashing 
at every bound. Ichabod’s flimsy garments fluttered in the air, 
as he stretched his long lank body away over his horse’s head, in 
30 the eagerness of his flight. 
They had now reached the road which turns off to Sleepy 
Hollow; but Gunpowder, who seemed possessed with a demon, 
instead of keeping up it, made an opposite turn, and plunged R 
headlong down hill to the left. This road leads through a sandy: 
8 hollow, shaded by trees for about a quarter of a mile, where it 
crosses the bridge famous in goblin story, and just beyond swells 
the green knoll on which stands the whitewashed church. before him on the pommel of the saddle; his terror rose to des- °

As yet the panic of the steed had given his unskillful rider an 
apparent advantage in the chase; but just as he had got half way 
through the hollow the girths of the saddle gave way, and he felt 
it slipping from under him. He seized it by the pommel, and 
endeavored to hold it firm, but in vain; and had just time to save 
himself by clasping old Gunpowder round thé neck, when the 
saddle fell to the earth, and he heard it trampled under foot by 
his pursuer. For a moment the terror of Hans Van Ripper’s 
wrath passed across his mind—for it was his Sunday saddle; but 
io this was no time for petty fears; the goblin was hard on his 
haunches; and (unskillful rider that he was!) he had much ado 
to maintain his seat; sometimes slipping on one side, sometimes 
on another, and sometimes jolted on the high ridge of his horse’s 
back-bone, with a violence that he verily feared would cleave him 
as asunder. 
An opening in the trees now cheered him with the hopes that 
the church bridge was at’ hand. The wavering reflection of a 
silver star in the bosom of the brook told him that he was not 
mistaken. He saw the walls of the church dimly glaring under 
20 the trees beyond. He recollected the place where Brom Bones’s 
ghostly competitor had disappeared. “If I can but reach that 
bridge,” thought Ichabod, “I am safe.” Just then he heard the 
black steed panting and blowing close behind him; he even fancied 
that he felt his hot breath. Another convulsive kick in the ribs, 
25 and old Gunpowder sprang upon the bridge; he thundered over 
the resounding planks; he gained the opposite side; and now 
Ichabod cast a look behind to see if his pursuer should vanish, 
according to rule, in a flash of fire and brimstone. Just then he 
saw the goblin rising in his stirrups, and in the very act of hurling 
so his head at him. Ichabod endeavored to dodge the horrible 
missile, but too late. It encountered his cranium with a tre- 
mendous crash—he was tumbled headlong into the dust, and Gun- 
powder, the black steed, and the goblin rider passed by like a 
whirlwind. 
85 The next morning the old horse was found without his saddle, 
- and with the bridle under his feet, soberly cropping the grass at 
his ‘master’s gate. Ichabod did: not make his appearance at

breakfast—dinner-hour came, but no Ichabod. The boys as- 
sembled at the schoolhouse, and strolled idly about the beuks of 
the brook, but no schoolmaster. Hans Van Ripper now began to 
feel some uneasiness about the fate of poor Iehabod and his saddle. 
An inquiry was set on foot, and after diligent investigation they 
came upon his traces. In one part of the road leading to the 
church was found the saddle trampled in the dirt; the tracks of 
horses’ hoofs deeply dented in the road, and evidently at furious 
speed, were traced to the bridge, beyond which, on.the bank of a 
broad part of the brook, where the water ran deep and black, 
was found the hat of the unfortunate Ichabod, and close beside it 
a shattered pumpkin. 
The brook was searched, but the body of the schoolmaster 
was not to be discovered. Hans Van Ripper, as executor of his 
estate, examined the bundle which contained all his worldly 
effects. They consisted of two shirts and a half; two stocks for. 
the neck; a pair or two of worsted, stockings; an old pair of cor- 
duroy small-clothes; a rusty razor; a book of psalm tunes, full of 
dogs’ ears; and a broken pitchpipe. As to the books and furniture 
of the schoolhouse, they belonged to the community, excepting 
Cotton Mather’s History of Witchcraft, a New England Almanac, 
and a book of dreams and fortune-telling; in which last was a 
sheet of foolscap much scribbled and blotted in several fruitless 
attempts to make a copy of verses in honor of the heiress of Van 
Tassel. These magic books and the poetic scrawl were forth- 
with consigned to the flames by Hans Van Ripper, who from that 
time forward determined to send his children no more to school, 
observing that he never knew any good come of this same reading 
and writing. Whatever money the schoolmaster possessed, and 
he had received his quarter’s pay but a day or two before, he must 
have had about his person at the time of his disappearance. 
The mysterious event caused much speculation at the church 
on the following Sunday. Knots of gazers and gossips were col- 
lected in the churchyard, at the bridge, and at the spot where 
the hat and pumpkin had been found. The stories of Brouwer, of 
Bones, and a whole budget of others, were called to mind; and 
when they had diligently considered them all, and compared

them with the symptoms of the present case, they shooli 
heads, and came to the conclusion that tchabod had been casricu 
off by the galloping Hessian. As he was a oachelor, and in 
nobody’s debt, nobody troubled his head any more about him. 
The school was removed to a different quarter of the hollow, and 
another pedagogue reigned in his stead. 
It is true, an old farmer, who had been down to New York, 
on 4 visit several years after, and from whom this account of the 
ghostly adventure was received, brought home the intelligence 
that Ichabod Crane was still alive; that he had left the neighbor- 
hood, partly through fear of the goblin and Hans Van Ripper, and 
partly in mortification at having been suddenly dismissed by the 
heiress; that he had changed his quarters to a distant part of the 
country; had kept school and studied law at the same time, had 
been admitted to the bar, turned politician, electioneered, written 
for the newspapers, and finally had been made a justice of the Ten 
Pound Court.. Brom Bones, too, who shortly after his rival’s 
disappearance conducted the blooming Katrina in triumph to the 
altar, was observed to look exceedingly knowing whenever the 
story of Ichabod was related, and always burst into a hearty 
laugh at the mention of the pumpkin, which led some to suspect 
that he knew more about the matter than he chose to tell. 
The old country wives, however, who are the best judges of 
these matters, maintain to this day that Ichabod was spirited 
away by supernatural means; and it is a favorite story often told 
about the neighborhood round the winter evening fire. The bridge 
became more than ever an objeet of superstitious awe, and that 
may be the reason why the road has been altered of late years, 
so as to approach the church by the border of the mill-pond. The 
schoolhouse being deserted soon fell to decay, and was reported 
to be haunted by the ghost of the unfortunate pedagogue; and 
the plowboy, loitering homeward of a still summer evening, has 
often fancied his voice at a distance, chanting a melancholy psalm 
tune among the tranquil solitudes of Sleepy Hollow.

THE GREAT STONE FACE 
NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE 
One afternoon, when the sun was going down, a moti 
little boy sat at the door of their cottage, talking about 
Stone Face. They had but to lift their eyes, and tl: 
plainly to be seen, though miles away, with the sunshin 
ing all its features. 
And what was the Great Stone Face? 
Embosomed amongst a family of lofty mountainr ani 
- valley so spacious that it contained many thousanc - x Some of these good people dwelt in log-huts, with th: 
all around them, on the steep and difficult hillsides. 
their homes in comfortable farmhouses, and cultiv 
soil on the gentle slopes or level surfaces of the va 
again, were congregated into populous villages, whe 
highland rivulet, tumbling down from its birthplace 
mountain region, had been caught and tamed by hu: 
and compelled to turn the machinery of cotton-facto 
habitants of this valley, in short, were numerous, 
modes of life. But all of them, grown people and children, had a 
kind of familiarity with the Great Store Face, although some pos- 
sessed the gift of distinguishing this grand natural phenomenon 
more perfectly than many of their neighbors. 
The Great Stone Face, then, was a work of Nature in her 
mood of majestic playfulness, formed on the perpendicular side 
of a mountain by some immense rocks, which had been thrown 
together in such a position as, when viewed at a proper distance, 
precisely to resemble the features of the human countenance. It 
seemed as if an enormous giant, or a Titan, had sculptured his 
own likeness on the precipice. There was the broad arch of the 
forehead, a hundred feet in height; the nose, with its long bridge; 
and the vast lips, which, if they could have spoken, would have 
rolled their thunder accents from one end of the valley to the

other. True it is, that if the spectator approached too near, he 
jost the outline of the gigantic visage, and could discern only a 
heap of ponderous and gigantic rocks, piled in chaotic ruin one 
upon another. Retracing his steps, however, the wondrous fea- 
tures would again be seen; and the farther he withdrew from 
tiem, the more like a human face, with all its original divinity 
intact, did they appear; until,-as it grew dim in the distance, with 
the clouds and glorified vapor of the mountains clustering about 
it, the Great Stone Face seemed positively to be alive. 
It was a happy lot for children to grow up to manhood or 
womanhood with the Great Stone Face before their eyes, for all 
the features were noble, and the expression was at once grand 
and sweet, as if it were the glow of a vast, warm heart, that em- 
braced all mankind in its affections, and had room for more. It 
was an education only to look at it. According to the belief of 
many people, the valley owed much of its fertility to this benign 
aspect that was continually beaming over it, illuminating the 
clouds, and infusing its tenderness into the sunshine. 
As we began with saying, a mother and her little boy sat at 
their cottage-door, gazing at the Great Stone Face, and talking 
aboutiit. The child’s name was Ernest. 
“Mother,” said he, while the Titanic visage smiled on him, 
“I wish that it could speak, for it looks so very kindly that its 
voice must needs be pleasant. If I were to see a man with such a 
face, I should love him dearly.” 
“If an old prophecy should come to pass,” answered his 
mother, “we may see a man, some time or other, with exactly such 
a face as that.” 
“What prophecy do you mean, dear mother?” eagerly inquired 
Emnest. “Pray tell me all about it!” 
So his mother told him a story that her own mother had told 
to her, when she herself was younger than little Ernest’; a story, 
not of things that were past, but of what was yet to come; a 
story, nevertheless, so very old, that even the Indians, who for- 
merly inhabited this valley, had heard it from their forefathers, 
to whom, as they affirmed, it had been murmured by the moun- 
‘ain streams, and whispered by the wind among the tree-tops.
-P-A-G-E-529

The purport was, that, at some future day, a child should be born| 
hereabouts, who was destined to become the greatest and noblest 
personage of his time, and whose countenance, in manhood, should| 
bear an exact resemblance to the Great Stone Face. Not a few 
old-fashioned people, and young ones likewise, in the ardor of 
their hopes, still cherished an enduring faith in this old prophecy. 
But others, who had seen more ofthe world, had watched and 
waited till they were weary, and had beheld no man with such a 
face, nor any man that proved to be much greater or nobler than 
his neighbors, concluded it to be nothing but an idle tale. At all 
events, the great man of the prophecy had not yet appeared. 
“O mother, dear mother!” cried Ernest, clapping his hands 
above his head, “I do hope that I shall live to see him!” 
His mother was an affectionate and thoughtful woman, and 
felt that it was wisest not to discourage the generous hopes of her 
little boy. So she only said to him, “Perhaps you may.” 
And Ernest never forgot the story that his mother tc 
It was always in his mind, whenever he looked upon th: 
Stone Face. He spent his childhood in the log-cottage where uv 
was born, and was dutiful to his mother, and helpful to her in 
many things, assisting her much with his little hands, and more 
with his loving heart. In this manner, from a happy yet often 
pensive child, he grew up to be a mild, quiet, unobtrusive boy, 
and.sun-browned with labor in the fields, but with more intelli- 
gence brightening his aspect than is seen in many lads who have 
been taught at famous schools. Yet Ernest had had no teacher, 
save only that the Great Stone Face became one to him. When 
the toil of the day was over, he would gaze at it for hours, until 
he began to imagine that those vast features recognized him, and 
gave him a smile of kindness and encouragement, responsive to 
his own look of veneration. We must not take upon us to affirm 
that this was a mistake, although the Face may have looked no 
more kindly at Ernest than at all the world besides. But the 
secret was that the boy’s tender and confiding simplicity discerned 
what other people could not see; and thus the love, which was 
meant for all, became his peculiar portion. 
About this time there went a rumor throughout the valley, that
-P-A-G-E-530
  The Great Stone Face 513 
  the great man, foretold from ages long ago, who was to bear a 
resemblance to the Great Stone Face, had appeared at last. It 
| seems that, many years before, a young man had migrated from 
' the valley and settled at a distant seaport, where, after getting 
; together a little money, he had set up as a shopkeeper. His name 
—but I could never learn whether it was his real one, or a nick- 
name that had: grown out of his habits and suceess in life—was 
Gathergold. Being shrewd and active, and endowed by Provi- 
\ dence with that inscrutable faculty which develops itself in what 
the world calls luck, he became an exceedingly rich merchant, - 
| and owner of a whole fleet of bulky-bottomed ships. All the 
ccuntries of the globe appeared to join hands for the mere pur- 
pose of adding heap after heap -to the mountainous accumulation 
| of this one man’s wealth. The cold regions of the north, almost 
f° within the gloom and shadow of the Arctic Circle, sent him their 
: tribute in the shape of furs; hot Africa sifted for him the golden 
sands of her rivers, and gathered up the ivory tusks of her great 
elephants out of the forests; the East came bringing ‘him the rich 
shawls, aad spices, and teas, and the effulgence of diamonds, and 
« the gleaming purity of large pearls. The ocean, not to be behind- 
hand with the earth, yielded up her mighty whales, that Mr. 
Gathergold might sell their oil, and make a profit on it. Be the 
{ original commodity what it might, it was gold within his grasp. It 
might be said of him, as of Midas in the fable, that whatever he 
touched with his finger immediately glistened, and grew yellow, 
and was changed at once into sterling metal, or, which suited him 
still better, into piles of coin. And, when Mr. Gathergold had 
; become so very rich that it would have taken him a hundred years 
only to count his wealth, he bethought himself of his native valley, 
and resolved to go back thither, and end his days where he was 
born. With this purpose in view, he sent a skillful architect to 
| build him such a palace as should be fit for a man of his vast 
| wealth to live in. 
    As I have said above, it had already been rumored in the 
«% valley that Mr. Gathergold had turned out to be the prophetic 
personage so long and vainly looked for, and that his visage was 
the perfect and undeniable similitude of the Great Stone Face. IHL. 1—18

  People were the more ready to believe that this must needs be 
the fact, when they beheld the splendid edifice that rose, as if by 
enchantment, on the site of his father’s old weatherbeaten farm- 
house. The exterior was of marble, so dazzlingly white that it 
+ seemed as though the whole structure might melt away in the sun- 
shine, like those humbler ones which Mr. Gathergold, in his young 
play-days, before his fingers were gifted with the touch of trans- 
mutation, had been accustomed to build of snow. It had a richly 
ornamented portico, supported by tall pillars, beneath which was 
a lofty door, studded with silver knobs, and made of a kind of 
variegated wood that had been brought from beyond the sea. 
The windows, from the floor to the ceiling of each stately apart- 
ment, were composed, respectively, of but one enormous pane of 
glass, so transparently pure that it was said to be a finer medium 
than even the vacant atmosphere. Hardly anybody had been 
permitted to see the interior of this palace; but it was reported, 
and with good semblance of truth, to be far more gorgeous than 
the outside, insomuch that whatever was iron or brass in other 
houses was silver or gold in this; and Mr. Gathergold’s bedcham- 
ber, especially, made such a glittering appearance that no ordinary 
man would have been able to close his eyes there. But, o 
other hand, Mr. Gathergold was now so inured to wealth 
perhaps he could not have closed his eyes unless where the gieam 
of it was certain to find its way beneath his eyelids. 
28 Tn due time, the mansion was finished; next came the uphol- 
3 sterers, with magnificent furniture; then, a whole troop of black 
and white servants, the harbingers of Mr. Gathergold, who, in his 
own majestic person, was expected to arrive at sunset. Our friend 
Ernest, meanwhile, had been deeply stirred by the idea that the 
great man, the noble man, the man of prophecy, after so many 
ages of delay, was at length to be made manifest to his native 
valley. He knew, boy as he was, that there were a thousand 
ways in which Mr. Gathergold, with his vast wealth, might trans- 
form himself into an angel of beneficence, and assume a control Ss 
35 over human affairs as wide and benignant as the smile of the 
Great Stone Face. Full of faith and hope, Ernest doub 
that what the people said was true, and that now he was tc

  | the living likeness of those wondrous features on the mountain- 
side. While the boy was still gazing up the valley, and fancying, 
as he always did, that the Great Stone Face returned his gaze and 
looked kindly at him, the rumbling of wheels was heard, ap- 
proaching swiftly along the winding road. 
“Here he comes!” cried a group of people who were assembled 
to witness the arrival. “Here comes the great Mr. Gathergold!” 
A carriage, drawn by four horses, dashed round the turn of the 
road. Within it, thrust partly out of the window, appeared the 
| physiognomy of the old man, with a-skin as yellow as if his own 
Midas-hand had transmuted it. He had a low forehead, small, 
sharp eyes, puckered about with innumerable wrinkles, and very 
thin lips, which he made still thinner by pressing them forcibly 
together. 
f “The very image of the Great Stone Face!” shouted the people. 
“Sure enough, the old prophecy is true; and here we have the 
great man come, ‘at last!” : ‘ 
And, what greatly perplexed Ernest, they seemed actually to 
believe that here was the likeness which they spoke of. By the 
roadside there chanced to be an old beggar-woman and two little 
beggar-children, stragglers from some far-off region, who, as the 
carriage rolled onward, held out their hands and lifted up their 
doleful voices, most piteously beseeching charity. A yellow claw 
—the very same that had clawed together so much wealth—poked 
itself out of the coach-window, and dropped some copper coins 
upon the ground; so that, though the great man’s name seems to 
have been Gathergold, he might just as suitably have been nick~- 
' named Scattercopper. Still, nevertheless, with an earnest shout, 
and with as much good faith as ever, the people bellowed— 
2 “He is the very image of the Great Stone Face!” 
But Ernest turned sadly from the wrinkled shrewdness of that 
sordid visage, and gazed up the valley, where, amid a gathering 
mist, gilded by the last sunbeams, he could still distinguish 
those glorious features which had impressed themselves into his 
soul. Their aspect cheered him. What did the benign lips seem 
| to say? 
“He will come! Fear not, Ernest; the man will come!”

The years went on, and Ernest ceased to bi _ 
grown to be a young man now. He attracted 
the other inhabitants of the valley; for they saw 
able in his way of life, save that, when the labc 
over, he still loved to go apart and gaze and 1 
Great Stone Face. According to their idea of th 
folly, indeed, but pardonable, inasmuch as Ernes 
kind, and neighborly, and neglected no duty fi 
dulging this idle habit. They knew not that 
Face had become a teacher to him, and that the ccucuucuy wien 
was expressed in it would enlarge the young man’s heart, and fill 
it with wider and deeper sympathies than cther heat 
knew not that thence would come a better wisdom thai 
learned from books, and a better life than could be mok 
defaced example of other human lives. Neither did Er 
that the thoughts and affections which came to him so 
in the fields and at the fireside, and wherever he comm 
himself, were of a higher tone than those which all m 
with him. A simple soul—simple as when his mother fi 
him the old prophecy—he beheld the marvelous feature 
adown the valley, and still wondered that their humatr 
part was so long in making his appearance. 
By this time poor Mr. Gathergold was dead and bt 
the oddest part of the matter was that his wealth, ¥ 
the body and spirit of his existence, had disappeared

consigned him to forgetfulness after his decease. Once in :

yet to come. 
It so happened that a native-born son of the valley, many 
years before, had enlisted as a soldier, and, after a great deal 
of hard fighting, had now become an illustrious commander. 
Whatever he may be called in history, he was known in camps 
and on the battlefield under the nickname of Old Blood-and- 
Thunder. This war-worn veteran, being now infirm with age and 
wounds, and weary of the turmoil of a military life, and of the 
roll of the drum and the clangor of the trumpet, that had so long 
been ringing in his ears, had lately signified a purpose of return- 
ing to: his native valley, hoping to find repose where he remem- 
bered to have left it, The inhabitants, his old neighbors and their 
grown-up children, were resolved to welcome the renowned war- 
rior with a salute of cannon and a public dinner; and all the more 
enthusiastically, it being affirmed that now, at last, the likeness 
of the Great Stone Face had actually appeared. An aid-de-camp 
of Old Blood-and-Thunder, traveling through the valley, was said 
to have been struck with the resemblance. Moreover the schooi- 
mates and early acquaintances of the general were ready to tes- 
tify, on oath, that, to the best of their recollection, the aforesaid 
general had been exceedingly like the majestic image, even when 
a boy, only that the idea had never occurred to them at that 
period. Great, therefore, was the excitement throughout the val- 
ley; and many people, who had never once thought of glancing at 
the Great Stone Face for years before, now spent their time in 
gazing at it, for the sake of knowing exactly how General Blood- 
and-' Thunder looked. 
On the day of the great festival, Ernest and all the other peo- 
ple of the valley left their work, and proceeded to the spot where 
the sylvan banquet was prepared. As he approached, the loud 
voice of the Rev. Dr. Battleblast was heard, beseeching a bless- 
ing on the good things set before them, and on the distinguished 
*-nd of peace in whose honor they were assembled. The tables 
e arranged in a cleared space of the woods, shut in by the sur- 
ading trees, except where a vista opened eastward, and af- 
led a distant view of the Great Stone Face. Over the general’s

and speeches, and to catch any word that might

character, was thrust quite into the background, wauue ue wou

had been still blazing on the battlefield. To, console him:

through the vista of the forest. Meanwhile, however, h:

ing the features of the hero with the face on the distant mountain- 
side. ‘

for joy. . 
“Wonderfully like, that’s a fact!” responded another. 
“Like! why, I call it Old Blood-and-Thunder him: ~ 
monstrous looking-glass!” cried a third. “And why not? 
greatest man of this or any other age, beyond a doubt.’ 
And then all three of the speakers gave a great shc: 
communicated electricity to the crowd, and called fori 
from a thousand voices, that went reverberating for mi! 
the mountains, until you might have supposed that t_. _..__. 
Stone Face had poured its thunder-breath into the cry. All these 
comments, and this vast enthusiasm, served the more to interest 
our friend; nor did he think of questioning that now, at length, 
the mountain-visage had found its human counterpart. It is true, 
Ernest had imagined that this long-looked-for personage would 
35 appear in the character of a man of peace, uttering wisdom, and 
doing good, and making people happy. But, taking an habitual 
breadth of view, with all his simplicity, he contended ‘that Provi- a

  dence should choose its own method of blessing mankind, and 
could conceive that this great end might be effected even by a 
warrior and a bloody sword, should inserutable wisdom see fit to 
order matters so. 
“The general! the general!” was now the cry. “Hush! silence! 
Old Blood-and-Thunder’s going to make a speech.” 
Even so; for, the cloth being removed, the general’s health 
had been drunk, amid shouts of applause, and he now stood upon 
his feet to thank the company. Ernest saw him. There he was, 
over the shoulders of the crowd, from the two ‘glittering epaulets 
and embroidered collar upward, beneath the arch of green boughs — 
with intertwined laurel, and the banner drooping as if to shade 
his brow! And there, too, visible in the same glance, through the 
vista of the forest, appeared the Great Stone Face! And was 
there, indeed, such a resemblance as the crowd had testified? 
[ alas, Ernest could not recognize it! He beheld a war-worn and 
| weatherbeaten countenance, full of energy, and expressive of an 
iron will; but the gentle wisdom, the deep, broad, tender sym- 
pathies, were altogether wanting in Old Blood-and-Thunder’s 
visage; and even if the Great Stone Face had assumed his look 
of stern command, the milder traits would still have tempered it. 
“This is not the man of prophecy,” sighed Ernest to himself, 
as he made his way out of the throng. “And must the world wait 
longer yet?” 
The mists had congregated about the distant mountain-side, 
and there were seen the grand and awful features of the Great 
Stone Face, awful but benignant, as if a mighty angel were sitting 
among the hills, and enrobing himself in a cloud-vesture of gold 
and purple. As he looked, Ernest could hardly believe but that a 
smile beamed over the whole visage, with a radiance still bright- 
ening, although without motion of the lips. It was probably the 
effect of the western sunshine, melting through the thinly diffused 
vapors that had swept between him and the object that he gazed 
at. But—as it always did—the aspect of his marvelous friend 
made Ernest as hopeful as if he had never hoped in vain. 
“Fear not, Ernest,” said his heart, even as if the Great Face 
were whispering him—‘“fear not, Ernest; he wil? come.”

  him; wrong looked like right, and right like wrong; for when it 
pleased him, he could make a kind of illuminated fog with his 
mere breath, and obscure the natural daylight with it. His tongue, 
indeed, was a magic instrument: sometimes it rumbled like the 
ls thunder; sometimes it warbled like the sweetest music. It was 
the blast of war—the song of peace; and.it seemed to have a heart 
in it, when there was no such matter. In good truth, he was a 
wondrous man; and when his tongue had acquired him all other 
imaginable success—when it had been heard in halls of state, and 
in the courts of princes and potentates—after it had made him 
known all-over the world, even as a voice crying from shore to 
shore—it finally persuaded his countrymen to select him for the 
Presidency. Before this time—indeed, as soon as he began to 
grow celebrated—his admirers had found out the resemblance 
between him and the Great Stone Face; and so much were they 
struck by it, that throughout the country this distinguished gen- 
tleman was known by the name of Old Stony Phiz. The phrase 
was considered as giving a highly favorable aspect to his political 
prospects; for, as is likewise the case with the Pepedom, nobody 
ever becomes President without taking a name other than his own. 
While his friends were doing their best to make him President, 
Old Stony Phiz, as he was called, set out on a visit to the valley 
_ where he was born. Of course, he had no other object than to 
shake hands with his fellow-citizens, and neither thought nor 
cared about any effect which his progress through the country 
might have upon the election. Magnificent preparations were 
made to receive the illustrious. statesman; a cavalcade of horse- 
men set forth to meet him at the boundary line of the State, and 
all the people left their business and gathered along the wayside 
to see him pass. Among these was Ernest. Though more than 
once disappointed, as we have seen, he had such a hopeful and 
confiding nature that he was always ready to believe in whatever 
seemed beautiful and good. He kept his heart continually open, 
and thus was sure to catch the blessing from on high when it 
should come. So now again, as buoyantly as ever, he went forth 
to behold the likeness of the Great Stone Face. : The cavaleade came prancing along the road, with a great 
 
-P-A-G-E-539
  
522 Junior High School Literature, Book 
clattering of hoofs and a mighty cloud of dust, which rose up so 
dense and high that the visage of the mountain-side was com- 
pletely hidden from Ernest’s eyes. All the great men of the neigh- 
‘borhood were there on horseback; militia officers, in uniform; the 
% member of Congress; the sheriff of the county ; the editors of news- 
papers; and many a farmer, too, had mounted his patient steed, 
with his Sunday coat upon his back. It really was a very brilliant 
spectacle, especially as there were numerous banners flaunting 
over the cavalcade, on some of which were gorgeous portraits of 
1 the illustrious statesman and the Great Stone Face, smiling famil- 
iarly at one another, like two brothers. If the pictures were to be 
trusted, the mutual resemblance, it must be confessed, was mar- 
velous. We must not forget to mention that there was a band of 
music, which made the echoes of the mountains ring and rever- 
as berate with the loud triumph of its strains; so that airy and soul- 
thrilling melodies broke out among all the heights and hollows, 
as if every nook of his native valley had found a voice, to wel- 
come the distinguished guest. But the grandest effect was when 
the far-off mountain precipice flung back the music; for then 
20 the Great Stone Face itself -seemed to be swelling the triumphant 
chorus, in acknowledgment that, at length, the man of prophecy 
was come. 
All this while the people were throwing up their hats and 
shouting with enthusiasm so contagious that the heart of Ernest 
25 kindled up, and he likewise threw up his hat, and shouted, as 
loudly as the loudest, “‘Huzza for the great man! Huzza for Old 
Stony Phiz!” But as yet he had not seen him. 
“Here he is, now!” cried those who stood near Ernest. “There! 
There! Look at-Old Stony Phiz and then at the Old Man of the 
so Mountain, and see if they are not as like as two twin-brothers!” 
In the midst of all this gallant array came an open barouche, 
drawn by four white horses; and in the barouche, with his massive 
head uncovered, sat the illustrious statesman, Old Stony Phiz 
himeelf. 
ed “Confess it,” said one of Ernest’s neighbors to him, “the Great 
Stone Face has met its match at last!” 
Now, it must be owned that, at his first glimpse of the coun-
-P-A-G-E-540
  The Great Stone Face : 523 
  tenance which was bowing and smiling from the barouche, Ernest 
| did fancy that there was a resemblance between it and the old 
familiar face upon the mountain-side. The brow, with its massive 
| depth and loftiness, and all the other features, indeed, were boldly 
js and strongly hewn, as if in emulation of a more than heroic, of a 
Titanic model. But the sublimity and stateliness, the grand ex- 
pression: of a divine sympathy, that illuminated the mountain 
visage and etherealized its ponderous granite substance into spirit, 
might here be sought in vain. Something had been originally left 
\, out, or had departed. And therefore the marvelously gifted states- 
man had always a weary gloom in the deep caverns of his eyes, as 
of a child that has outgrown its playthings or a man of mighty 
faculties and little aims, whose life, with all its high performances, 
was vague and empty, because no high purpose had endowed it 
f° with reality. 
Still, Ernest’s neighbor was thrusting his elbow into his side, 
and pressing him for an answer. 
“Confess! confess! Is not he the very picture of your Old Man 
of the Mountain?” 
“No!” said Ernest, bluntly, “T see. little or no likeness.” 
“Then so much the worse for the Great Stone Face!” answered 
his neighbor; and again he set up a shout for Old Stony Phiz. 
But Ernest turned away, melancholy, and almost despondent; 
for this was the saddest of his disappointments, to behold a man 
1s who might have fulfilled the prophecy, and had not willed to do 
so. Meantime, the cavalcade, the banners, the music, and the 
barouches swept past him, with the vociferous crowd in the rear, 
leaving the dust to settle down, and the Great Stone Face to be 
revealed again, with the grandeur that it had worn for untold 
centuries. 
“Lo, here I am, Ernest!” the benign lips seemed to say. “I 
have waited longer than thou, and am not yet weary. Fear not; 
the man will come.” 
The years hurried onward, treading in their haste on one an- 
8 other’s heels. And now they began to bring white hairs, and scat- - 
ter them over the head of Ernest; they made reverend wrinkles 
across his forehead, and furrows in his cheeks. He was an aged
-P-A-G-E-541
o 2 a (524 Junior High School Literature, Book 
man. But not in vain had he grown old: more than the white 
hairs on his head were the sage thoughts in his mind; his wrinkles 
and. furrows were inscriptions that Time had graved, and in which 
he had written legends of wisdom that had been tested by the 
tenor of a life., And Ernest had ceased to be obscure. Unsought 
for, undesired, had come the fame which so many seek, and made 
him known in the great world, beyond the limits of the valley in 
which he had dwelt so quietly.- College professors, and even the 
active men of cities, came from far to see and converse with 
Ernest; for the report had gone abroad that this simple husband- 
man had ideas unlike those of other men, not gained from books, 
but of a higher tone—a tranquil and familiar majesty, as if he had 
been talking with the angels as his daily friends. Whether it 
were sage, statesman, or philanthropist, Ernest received these vis- 
itors with the gentle sincerity that had characterized him trom 
boyhood, and spoke freely with them of whatever came upper- 
most, or lay deepest in his heart or their own. While they talked 
together, his face would kindle, unawares, and shine upon them, 
as with a mild evening light. Pensive with the fulness of such 
discourse, his guests took leave and went their way; and passing 
up the valley, paused to look at the Great Stone Face, imagining 
that they had seen its likeness i ina human countenance, but could 
not remember where. 
While Ernest had been growing up and growing old, a 1 bounti- 
ful Providence had granted a new poet to this earth. He, likewise, 
was a native of the valley, but had spent the greater part of his 
life ata distance from that romantic region, pouring out his sweet 
music amid the bustle and din of cities. Often, however, did the 
mountains which had been familiar to him in his childhood lift 
their snowy peaks into the clear atmosphere of his poetry. Neither 
was the Great Stone Face forgotten; for the poet had celebrated 
it in an ode, which was grand enough to have been uttered by its 
own majestic lips. This man of genius, we may say, had come 
-down from heaven with wonderful endowments. If he sang of a 
mountain, the eyes of all mankind beheld a mightier grandeur 
reposing on its breast, or soaring to its summit, than had before 
been seen there. If his theme were a lovely lake, a celestial smile

oe a The Great Stone Face. 525 
  had now been thrown over it, to gleam forever on its surface. If 
it were the vast old sea, even the deep immensity of its dread 
bosom seemed to swell the higher, as if moved by the emotions 
of the song. Thus the world assumed another and a better aspect 
from the hour that the poet blessed it with his happy eyes. The 
Creator had bestowed him, as the last best touch to his own handi- 
work. Creation was not finished till the poet came to interpret, 
and so complete it. 
The effect was no less high and beautiful, when his human 
brethren were the subject of his verse. The man or woman, sordid 
with the common dust of life, who crossed his daily path, and the 
little child who played in it, were glorified if he beheld them in his 
mood of poetic faith. He showed the golden links of the great 
chain that intertwined them with an angelic kindred; he brought 
out the hidden traits of a celestial birth that made them worthy 
of such kin. Some, indeed, there were, who thought to show the 
soundness of their judgnient by affirming that all the beauty and 
dignity of the natural world existed only in the poet’s fancy: Let 
such men speak for themselves, who undoubtedly appear to have 
been spawned forth by Nature with a contemptuous bitterness; 
-’she having plastered them up out of her refuse stuff, after all the 
swine were made. As respects all things else, the poet’s ideal was 
the truest truth. 
The songs of this poet found their way to Ernest. He read 
them after his customary toil, seated on the bench before his cot- 
tage-door, where for such a length of time he had filled his repose 
with thought, by gazing at the Great Stone Face. And now as he 
' read stanzas that caused the soul to thrill within him, he lifted his 
  eyes to the vast countenance beaming on him so benignantly. 
“© majestic friend,” he murmured, addressing the Great Stone 
Face, “is not this man worthy to resemble thee?” 
The Face seemed to smile, but answered not a word. 
Now it happened that the poet, though he dwelt so far away, 
had not-only heard of Ernest, but had meditated much upon his 
character, until he deemed nothing so desirable as to meet this 
man, whose untaught wisdom walked hand in hand with the noble 
simplicity of his life. One summer morning, therefore, he took
-P-A-G-E-543
or 526 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
passage by the railroad, and, in the decline of the afternoon, 
alighted from the cars at no great distance from Ernest’s cottage. 
The great hotel, which had formerly been the palace of Mr. 
Gathergold, was close at hand, but the poet, with his carpetbag 
on his arni, inquired at once where Ernest dwelt, and was resolved 
to be accepted as his guest. 
Approaching the door,he there found the good old man, hold- 
ing a volume in his hand, which alternately he read, and then, 
with a finger between the leaves, looked lovingly at the Great 
Stone Face. 
“Good evening,” said the poet. “Can you give a traveler a 
night’s lodging?” 
“Willingly,” answered Ernest; and then he added, smiling, 
“Methinks I never saw the Great Stone Face look so hospitably 
at a stranger.” 
The poet sat down on the bench beside him, and he and Ernest 
talked together. Often had the poet held intercourse with the 
wittiest and the wisest but never before with a man like Ernest, 
whose thoughts and feelings gushed up with such a natural free- 
dom, and who made great truths so familiar by his simple utter- 
ance of them. Angels, as had been so often said, seemed to have 
- wrought with him at his labor in the fields; angels seemed to have 
sat with him by the fireside; and, dwelling with angels as friend 
with friends, he had imbibed the sublimity of their ideas, and 
imbued it with the sweet and lowly charm of household words. So 
thought the poet. And Ernest, on the other hand, was moved 
and agitated by the living images which the poet flung out of his 
mind, and which peopled all the air about the cottage-door with 
shapes of beauty, both gay and pensive.. The sympathies of these 
two men instructed them with a profounder sense than either could 
have attained alone. Their minds accorded into one strain, and 
made delightful music which neither of them could have claimed 
as all his own, nor distinguished his own share from the other’s. 
They led one another, as it were, into a high pavilion of their 
thoughts, so remote, and hitherto so dim, that they had never 
entered it before, and so beautiful that they desired te be there 
always.
-P-A-G-E-544
  As Ernest listened to the poet, he imagined that the Great 
Stone Face was bending forward to listen too. He gazed earnestly 
into the poet’s glowing eyes. , 
“Who are you, my strangely gifted guest?” he said. 
s The poet laid his finger on the volume that Ernest had been 
j reading. . : 
“You have read these poems,” said he. “You know me, then, The Great Stone Face : 527 
the poet’s features; then turned towards the Great Stone Pace; for I wrote them.” 
Again, and still more earnestly than before, Ernest examined 
then back, with an uncertain aspect, to his guest. But his ceun-~ 
tenance fell; he shook his head, and sighed. ‘ 
“Wherefore are you sad?” inquired the poet. 
“Because,” replied Ernest, “all through life I have awaited. 
% the fulfilment of a prophecy; and, when I read these poems, I 
hoped that it might be fulfilled in you.” 
“You hoped,” answered the poet, faintly smiling, “to find in 
me the likeness of the Great Stone Face. And you are disap- 
pointed, as formerly with Mr. Gathergold, and Old Blood-and- 
w Thunder, and Old Stony Phiz. Yes, Ernest, it is my doom. You 
must. add my name to the illustrious three, and record another 
failure of your hopes. For—in shame and sadness do I speak it, 
Ernest—I am not worthy to be typified by yonder benign and 
majestic image.” 
s “And why?” asked Ernest. He pointed to the volume. “Are 
| not those thoughts divine?” “They have a strain of the Divinity,” replied the poet. “You 
can hear in them the far-off echo of a heavenly song. But my life, 
dear Ernest, has not corresponded with my thought. I have had 
» grand dreams, but they have been only dreams, because I have 
lived—and that, too, by my own choice—among poor and mean 
realities. Sometimes even—shall I dare to say it?—I lack faith 
in the grandeur, the beauty, and the goodness, which my own 
works are said to have made more evident in nature and in human 
% life. Why, then, pure seeker of the good and true, shouldst thou 
| hope to find me, in yonder image of the divine?” .

The poet spoke sadly, and his eyes were dim with tear: 
likewise, were those of Ernest. 
At the hour of sunset, as had long been his frequent custom, 
Ernest was to discourse to an assemblage of the neighboring i in- 
habitants in the open air. He and the poet, arm in arm, ~ 
talking together as they went along, proceeded to the spot. 
was a small nook among the hills, with a gray precipice behinu, 
the stern front of which was relieved by the pleasant foliage of 
many creeping plants that made a tapestry for the naked rock, by 
hanging their festoons from all its rugged angles. At a small ele- 
vation above the ground, set in a rich framework of verdure, there 
appeared a niche, spacious enough to admit a human figure, with 
freedom for such gestures as spontaneously accompany earnest 
thought and genuine emotion. Into this natural pulpit Ernest 
ascended, and threw a look of familiar kindness around upon his 
audience. They stood, or sat, or reclined upon the grass, as 
seemed good to each, with the departing sunshine falling obliquely 
over them, and mingling its subdued cheerfulness with the sol- 
emnity of a grove of ancient trees, beneath and amid the boughs 
of which the golden rays were constrained to pass. In another 
direction was seen the Great Stone Face, with the same cheer, 
combined with the same solemnity, in its benignant. aspect. 
Ernest began to speak, giving to the people of what was in his 
aeart and mind. His words had power, because they accorded 
with his thoughts; and his thoughts had reality and depth, be- 
cause they harmonized with the life which he had always lived. 
It was not mere breath that this preacher uttered; they were the 
words of life, because a life of good deeds and holy love was melted 
into them. Pearls, pure and rich, had been dissolved into this pre- 
cious draught. The poet, as he listened, felt that the being and 
character of Ernest were a nobler strain of poetry than he had 
ever written. His eyes glistening with tears, he gazed reveren- 
tially at the venerable man, and said within himself that never 
was there an aspect so worthy of a prophet and a sage as that 
mild, sweet, thoughtful countenance, with the glory of white hair 
diffused about it. Ata distance, but distinctly to be seen, high up 
in the golden light of the setting sun, appeared the Great Stone
-P-A-G-E-546
  The Great Stone Face : 529 
  Face, with hoary mists around it, like the white hairs around the 
brow of Ernest. Its look of grand beneficence seemed to embrace 
the world. 
At that moment, in sympathy with a thought which he was 
s about to utter, the face of Ernest assumed a grandeur of expres- 
sion, so imbued with benevolence, that the poet, by an irresistible 
impulse, threw his arms aloft, and shouted— 
“Behold! Behold! Ernest is himself the likeness of the Great 
Stone Face!” 
ie Then all the people looked, and saw that what the deep-sighted 
poet said was true. The prophecy was fulfilled. But Ernest, 
having finished what he had to say, took the poet’s arm, and 
walked slowly homeward, still hoping that some wiser and better 
man than himself would by and by appear, bearing a resemblance 
w to the Great Stone Face.

AMERICAN LITERATURE OF LIGHTER VEIN 
  THE CELEBRATED JUMPING FROG 
MARK TWAIN 
In compliance with the request of a friend of. mine, who wrote 
me from the Hast, I called on good-natured, garrulous-old Simon 
Wheeler, and inquired after my friend’s friend, Leonidas W. 
Smiley, as requested to do, and I hereunto append the result. I 
s have a lurking suspicion that Leonidas W. Smiley is a myth; that 
my friend never knew such a personage; and that he only conjec- 
tured that, if I asked old Wheeler about him, it would remind him 
of his infamous Jim Smiley, and he would go to work and bore me 
nearly to'death with some infernal reminiscence of him as long 
- }19 and tedious as it should be useless to me. If that was the design, 
it certainly succeeded. 
I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the bar-room 
stove of the old, dilapidated tavern in the ancient mining camp 
of Angel’s, and I noticed that he was fat and bald-headed, and 
4% had an expression of winning gentleness and simplicity upon his 
tranquil countenance. He roused up and gave me good-day. I 
told him a friend of mine had commissioned me to make some 
inquiries about a cherished companion of his boyhood named 
Leonidas W. Smiley—Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley—a young min- 
% ister of the Gospel, who he had heard was at one time a resident

of Angel’s Camp. I added that, if Mr. Wheeler could tell me 
anything about this Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, I would feel under 
many obligations to him. 
Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me 
there with his chair, and then sat me down and reeled off the 
monotonous narrative which follows this paragraph. He never 
smiled, he never frowned, he never changed his voice from the 
gentle-flowing key to which he tuned the initial sentence, he never 
betrayed the slightest suspicion of enthusiasm; but all through 
the interminable narrative there ran a vein of impressive earnest- 
ness and sincerity, which showed me plainly that, so far from 
his imagining that there was anything ridiculous or funny about 
his story, he regarded it as a really important matter, and ad- 
mired its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in finesse... 
To me, the spectacle of a man drifting serenely along through 
‘such a queer yarn without ever smiling, was exquisitely absurd. | 
As I said before, I asked him to tell me what he knew of Rev. 
Leonidas W. Smiley, and he replied as follows. I let him go on 
_in his own way, and never interrupted him once: 
There was'‘a feller here once by the name of Jim Smiley, in 
the winter of “49—or maybe it was the spring of ’50—I don’t recol- 
lect exactly, somehow, though what makes me think it was one 
or the other is because I remember the big flume wasn’t finished 
when he first came to the camp; but any way, he was the curiosest 
man about always betting on any thing that turned up you ever 
see, if he could get anybody to bet on the other side; and if he 
couldn’t, he’d change sides. Any way that suited the other man 
would suit him—any way just so’s he got a bet, he was satisfied. 
But still he was lucky, uncommon lucky; he most always come 
out winner. He was always ready and laying for a chance; there 
couldn’t be no solitry thing mentioned but that feller’d offer to 
bet on it, and take any side you please, as I was just telling you. 
If there was a horse-race, you’d find him flush or you’d find him 
busted at the end of it; if there was a-dog-fight, he’d bet on it; if 
there was a cat-fight, he’d bet on it; if there was a chicken-fight, 
he’d bet on it; why, if there was two birds setting on a fence, he 
would bet you which one would fly first; or if there was a camp-

meeting, he would be there reg’lar, to bet on Parson Walker, 
which he judged tc be the best exhorter about here, and so he 
was, too, and a good maa. if he even seen a straddle-bug start to 
go anywheres, he would bet you how long it would take him to 
s get. to wherever he was going to, and if you took him up, he 
would foller that straddle-bug to Mexico but whau-he would find 
ou’ where ne was bound for and how long he was on the road. 
Lots of the boys here has seen that Smiley, and can tell you about 
him. Why, it never made no difference to him—he would bet on 
any thing—the dangdest feller. Parson Walker’s wife laid very 
sick once, for a good while; and it seemed as if they warn’t going 
to save her; but one morning he come in, and Smiley asked how 
she was, and he said she was considerable better—thank the Lord __ 
for his inf’nit mercy—and coming on so smart that, with the ~ ( 
3 blessing of Prov’dence, she’d get well yet; and Smiley, before he 
thought, says, “Well, I’ll risk two-and-a-half that she don’t, any 
“way.” 
- Thish-yer Smiley had a mare—the boys called her the fifteen- 
minute nag, but that was only in fun, you know, because, of 
course, she was faster than that—and he used to win money on 
that horse, for all she was so slow and always had the asthma, or 
the distemper, or the consumption, or something of that kind. 
They used to give her two or three hundred yards start, and then 
pass her under way; but always at the fag-end of the race she’d 
5 get excited and desperate-like, and come cavorting and strad- 
dling up, and scattering her legs around limber, sometimes in the 
air, and sometimes out to one side amongst the fences, and kicking 
up m-o-r-e dust, and raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing 
and sneezing and blowing her nose—and always fetch up at the 
} stand just about a neck ahead, as near as you could cipher it down. 
And he had a little small bull pup,-that to look at him you’d

— right, like a cat. He got him up so in the matter of catching 
flies, and kept him in practice so constant, that he’d nail a fly 
every time as far as he could see him. Smiley said all a frog 
wanted was education, and he could do most any thing—and I 
s believe him. Why, I’ve seen him set Dan’l Webster down here 
on this floor—Dan’] Webster was the name of the frog—and sing 
out, “Flies, Dan’l, flies!” and quicker’n you could wink, he’d 
spring straight up, and snake a fly off’n the counter there, and 
flop'down on the floor again as solid as a gob of mud, and fall.to 
w scratching the side of his-head with his hind foot as indifferent 
as if he hadn’t no idea he’a been doin’ any more’n any frog might 
do, You never see a frog so modest and straightfor’ard as he was, 
for all he was so gifted. And when it come to fair and square 
jumping on a dead level, he could get over more ground at one 
1s straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see. Jumping on 
a dead level was his strong suit, you understand; and when it come 
to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long as he had a 
red. Smiley was monstrous proud of that frog, and well he might 
be, for fellers that had traveled and been everywheres, all said 
* he laid over any frog that ever they see. 
Well, Smiley kept the beast in a little lattice box, and he used 
to fetch him down town sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a 
feller—a stranger in the camp, he was—come across him with his 
box, and says: 
s “What might it be that you’ve got in the box?” 
And Smiley says, sorter indifferent like, “It might be a parrot, 
or it might be a canary, maybe, but it an’t—it’s only just a frog.” 
And the feller took it and. looked at it careful, and turned it 
round this way and that, and says, ““H’m—so ’tis. Well, what’s 
3 he good for?” 
“Well,” Smiley says, easy and careless, ““He’s good enough 
for one thing, I should judge—he can outjump ary frog in Cala- 
veras county.” : / 
The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular 
% look, and give it back to Smiley, and says, very deliberate, “Well, 
I don’t see no p’ints about that frog that’s any better’n any other 
frog.” .

“Maybe you don’t,” Smiley says. “Maybe you understand 
frogs, and maybe you don’t understand ’em; maybe you’ve had 
experience, and maybe you an’t only a amature, as it were. Any- 
ways, I’ve got my opinion, and I’ll risk forty dollars that he can 
outjump any frog in Calaveras county.” 
And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder. sad 
like, “Well, I’m only a stranger here, and I ain’t got no frog; but 
if I had a frog, I’d bet you.” 
And then Smiley says, “That’s all right—that’s all right—if 
you'll hold my box a minute, Ill go and get you a frog.” And 
so the feller took the box, and put up his forty dollars along with 
Smiley’s, and set down to wait. 
So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to hisself, 
and then he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took 
a teaspoon and filled him full of quail shot—filled him pretty near 
up to his chin—and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the 
swamp and slopped around in the mud for a long time, and finally 
he ketched a frog, and fetched him in, and give him to this feller, 
and says: 
“Now, if you’re ready, set him alongside of Dan’l, with his 
forepaws just even with Dan’l, and I'll give the word.” Then he 
says, “One—two—three—jump!” and him and the feller. touched 
up the frogs from behind, and the new frog hopped off, but Dan’ 
give a heave, and hysted up his shoulders—so—like a Frenchman, 
but it wan’t no use—he couldn’t budge; he was planted as solid 
as an. anvil, and he couldn’t no more stir than if he was anchored 
out. Smiley was a good deal surprised, and he was disgusted 
too, but he didn’t have no idea what the matter was, of course. 
The feller took the money and started away; and when he 
was going out at the door, he sorter jerked his thumb over his 
shoulders—this way—at Dan’l, and says again, very deliberate, 
“Well, I don’t see no p’ints about that frog that’s any better’n 
any other frog.” 
Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan’l 
a long time, and at last he says, “I do wonder what in the nation 
that frog throw’d off for—I wonder if there an’t something the 
matter with him—he ’pears to look mighty baggy, somehow.”
-P-A-G-E-554
  
  And he ketched Dan’l by the nap of the neck, and lifted him up 
and says, “Why, blame my cats, if he don’t. weigh five pound!” 
and turned him upside down, and he belched out a double handful 
of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was the maddest 
5 man—he set the frog down and took out after that feller, but he 
never ketched him. And— 
[Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front 
yard, and got up to see what was wanted.] And turning to me 
as he moved away, he said, “Just set where you are, stranger, and 
1 rest easy—I ain’t going to be gone a second.” 
But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the 
history of the enterprising vagabond Jim Smiley would be likely 
to afford me much information concerning the Rev. Leonidas W. 
Smiley, and so I started away. © 
% At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he but- 
tonholed me and recommenced: 
“Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yaller one-eyed cow that didn’t 
have no tail, only jest a short stump like a bannanner, and—” 
“Oh, hang Smiley and his afflicted cow!” I muttered, good- 
'@ naturedly, and bidding the old gentleman good-day, I departed. | The Celebrated Jumping Frog 537 
NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Biography. Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835-1910), better known by 
his pen name Mark Twain, is America’s greatest humorous writer. Like 
Walt Whitman he was of: humble parentage. He was born in the 
village of Florida; Missouri, and at the age of four years, moved with his 
parents to the river town of Hannibal, which he immortalized in his two 
most popular books, Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. He became a 
printer and later a pilot on a Mississippi steamboat. For a few years he 
served as assistant to his brother who was secretary of the Territory of 
Nevada. This brought him in touch with the gold fields of the West, and he 
set out to make his fortune in a mining camp. He found only a very small 
amount of gold, but his wonderful experiences in the West furnish the basis 
of some of his most popular stories and books, such as “The Celebrated 
Jumping Frog” and Roughing It. As a newspaper reporter he chose the 
pen name Mark Twain, an old river expression, meaning the mark that regis- 
ters two (twain) fathoms (twelve feet) of water. His start to literary fame 
came with the publication of the story “The Celebrated Jumping Frog.” 
Later he traveled through Europe and the Holy Land, paying his expenses

by means of a series of letters describing his trip, written for a San Francisco 
newspaper. These letters were afterward collected in a book called The In- 
nocents Abroad, a delightfully humorous collection of descriptive sketches. 
For a time he was part owner and associate editor of the Buffalo Express, 
but the investment was not profitable and he spent much of his time on the 
lecture platform. He died at Redding, Connecticut, in his seventy-fifth year.

Biography. Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809-1894) was born in Cam- 
bridge, Massachusetts, the son of a Congregational minister. He attended 
Phillips Exeter Academy and was graduated from Harvard College in the 
famous elass of 1829. After studying medicine and anatomy in Paris, he © 
began practicing in Boston. Later he was made professor of anatomy

he wrote the poem “Old Ironsides” as a protest against the dismantling 
of the historic battleship Constitutton which lay in the harbor. It stirred 
the entire country so that the Secretary of the Navy found it advisable 
to recall the order he had issued. Like Bryant, Holmes was a poet on occa~ 
sion, not by profession. For more than forty years after he entered on his 
duties at Harvard he delivered his four lectures a week eight months of 
the year, and President Eliot bore witness that he was not less skillful 
with the scalpel and the microscope than with the pen. 
When Lowell was offered the editorship of the Atlantic Monthly, he 
made it a condition of his acceptance that Holmes should be a contributor. 
The result was a series of articles entitled The Autocrat of the Breakfast 
Table. Among his poems, the best known are his “Chambered Nautilus,” 
“The Height of the Ridiculous”, “The Deacon’s Masterpiece” (The One 
Hoss Shay), and short poems in celebration of various occasions. Among 
these are some forty poems read at anniversaries of his college class, notably 
the one beginning: “Has any old fellow got mixed with the boys?” In this 
he refers playfully to the author of “America” as one whom “Fate tried to 
conceal by naming him Smith.” . 
He wrote several novels, but it is as the author of the Autocrat series 
and by his humorous poems that he will be best remembered by his readers. 
By his personal associates he was most fondly remembered for his sunny, 
cheerful disposition and his witty conversation.

| One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And aixty 
cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time 
by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man ahd the butcher 
until one’s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony 
\, that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. 
One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be 
Christmas. 
There was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby 
little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the 
moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, 
with sniffles predominating. 
While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from 
5 first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A fur-   
  aished flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, 
but it certainly had that word on the lookout for the mendicancy 
squad. 
In the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter 
would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger 
could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bear- 
ing the name “Mr, James Dillingham Young.” 
The “Dillingham” had been flung to the breeze during a former 
Period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per 
week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, the letters of 
“Dillingham” looked blurred, as though they were thinking seri- 
ously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But when- 
ever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his 
flat above he was called “Jim” and greatly hugged by Mrs. James 
Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which is 
all very good. ; 
Della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the

powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a 
gray cat walking a gray fence in a gray backyard. Tomorrow 
would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to 
buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could 
for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn’t go 
far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They 
always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. 
Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice 
for him. Something fine and rare and sterling—something just 
a little bit near to being worthy of the honor of being owned by 
Jim. 
There was a pier-glass between the windows of the room. 
- Perhaps you have seen a pier-glass in an $8 flat. A very thin m a and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid 
sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate concep- 
tion of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art. 
Suddenly she whirled from the window and stoc? *-f--- +h~ 
glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her { 
its color within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pull: 
hair and let it fall to its full length. 
Now, there were two possessions of the James 
‘Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. 0) 
gold watch that had been his father’s and his grandfu.uw. 2 
other was Della’s hair. Had the Queen of Sheba lived in the flat 
across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out the 
window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty's jewels 
and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treas- 
ures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his 
watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard 
from envy. . 
So now Della’s beautiful hair fell about her, rippling -~7 
shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached belov 
knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And the. ~... 
did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a 
minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn| 
red carpet. :

  With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her 
eyes, she fluttered out of the door and down the stairs to the 
street. : 
Where she stopped, the sign read: “Mme. Sofronie. Hair 
s Goods of All Kinds.” One flight up Della ran, and collected her- 
self, panting. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked 
the “Sofronie.” 
“Will you buy my hair?” asked Della. 
“I buy hair,” said Madame. “Take yer hat off and let’s have 
1 a sight at the looks of it.” ’ , 
Down rippled the brown cascade. 
“Twenty dollars,” said Madame, lifting the mass with a prac- 
ticed hand. 
“Give it to me quick,” said Della. 
% Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget 
the hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim’s 
present. 
She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and 
no one else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and 
she had turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob 
chain, simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value 
by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation—as all 
good things should do. It was even worthy of The Watch. As 
soon as she saw it she knew that it. must be Jim’s. It was like him. 
[' Quietness and value—the description applied to both. Twenty- 
one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with

was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old

When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little 
to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted 
the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generos- 
ity added to love. Which is always a tremendous task, dear 
friends—a mammoth task. 
Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close- 
lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant school- | The Gift of the Magi . . 543

and critically. : 
“Tf Jim doesn’t kill me,” she said to herself, “befor: 
a second look at me, he’ll say I look like a Coney Isle 
girl. But what could I do—oh! what could I do with a: 
eighty-seven cents?” 
At 7 o’clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on 
the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops. 
Jim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain i 
and sat on the corner of the table near the door that 
entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away 
the first flight, and she turned white for Just a moment 
a habit of saying little silent prayers about the simples 
things, and now she whispered: “Please God, make hi

The door opened and Jim stepped in and closec! 
thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he was only 
and to be burdened with a family! He needed » 
and he was without gloves. 
Jim stopped inside the door, as immovable as a setter +

“Jim, darling,” she eried, “don’t look at me thai

mas without giving you a present. It’ll grow ou

“You've cut off your hair?” asked Jim laboriously, as if h 
had not arrived at that patent fact yet, even after the hardest 
mental labor.

as well, anyhow? I’m me without my hair, ain’t 1?” 
Jim looked about the room curiously. 
“You say your hair is gone?” he said, with an air almost of 
5 idiocy. . . 
“You needn’t look for it,” said Della. “It’s sold, I tell you— 
sold and gone, too. It’s Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for 
it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered,” 
she went on with a sudden serious sweetness, “but nobody could.

Out of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded 
his Della. For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny 
some inconsequential object in the other direction. Eight dollars: 
a week or a million a year—what is the difference? A mathema- 
% tician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi 
brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them. This dark 
assertion will be illuminated later on. 
Jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it. 
upon the table. ‘ 
« “Don’t make any mistake, Dell,” he said, “about me. I don’t. 
think there’s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a 
shampoo that could make me like my girl any less. But if you'll 
unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while

then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine 
change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate 
employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat. 
For there lay The Combs—the set of combs, side and back, 
that Della had’ worshiped for long in a Broadway window. 
Beautiful combs, pure tortoise shell, with jeweled rims—just the 
shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expen- 
sive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and 
yearned over them without the least hope of possession, And 
now they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned

WOUTER VAN TWILLER 
WASHINGTON IRVING 
It was in the year of our Lord 1629 that Mynheer Wouter Van 
Twiller was appointed governor of the province of Nieuw-Neder- 
landts, under the commission and control of their High Mighti- 
nesses, the Lords States General of the United Netherlands, and 
5 the privileged West India Company. 
This renowned old gentleman arrived at New-Amsterdam in 
the merry month of June, the sweetest month in all the year;

when Dan Apollo seems to dance up the transparent firmament 
— when the robin, the thrush, and a thousand other wanton song- 
sters made the woods resound with amorous ditties, and the 
luxurious little boblincon revels among the clover blossoms of 
the meadows—all which happy coincidence persuaded the old 
dames of New-Amsterdam, who were skilled in the art of fore- 
telling events, that this was to be a happy and prosperous admin- 
istration. ‘ 
The renowned Wouter (or Walter) Van Twiller was descended 
from a long line of Dutch burgomasters, who had successively 
dozed away their lives and grown fat upon the bench of magis- 
tracy in Rotterdam; and who had comported themselves with 
such singular wisdom and propriety, that they were never either 
heard or talked of—which, next to being universally applauded, 
should be the object of ambition of all sage magistrates and rulers. 
There are two opposite ways by which some men get into 
notice—one by talking a vast deal and thinking a little, and the 
other by. holding their tongues, and not thinking at all. By the 
first, many a vaporing, superficial pretender acquires the repu- 
tation of a man of quick parts—by the other, many a vacant 
dunderpate, like the owl, the stupidest of birds, comes to be com- 
plimented by a discerning world with all the attributes of wisdom. 
This, by the way, is a mere casual remark, which I would not for 
the universe have it thought I apply to Governor Van Twiller. 
On the contrary, he was a very wise Dutchman, for he never said 
a foolish thing—and of such invincible gravity, that he was never 
known to laugh, or even to smile, through the course of a long 
and prosperous life. Certain, however, it is, there never was a 
matter proposed, however simple, and on which your common 
narrow-minded mortals would rashly determine at the first glance, 
but what the renowned Wouter put on a mighty, mysterious, 
vacant kind of look, shook his capacious head, and, having smoked 
for five minutes with redoubled earnestness, sagely observed that 
he had his doupts about the matter—which in process of time 
gained him the character of a man slow in belief, and not easily 
imposed on. 
‘The person of this illustrious old gentleman was as regularly

formed and nobly proportioned, as though it had been molded 
by the hands of some cunning Dutch statuary, as a model of 
majesty and lordly grandeur. He was exactly five feet six inches 
in height, and six feet five inches in circumference. His head was. 
5 a perfect sphere, and of such stupendous dimensions that Dame 
Nature, with all her sex’s ingenuity, would have been puzzled to 
construct a neck capable of supporting it; wherefore she wisely 
declined the attempt, and settled it firmly on the top of his back-. 
bone, just between the shoulders. His body was of an oblong 
10 form, particularly capacious at bottom; which was wisely ordered. 
by Providence, seeing that he was a man of sedentary habits, 
and very averse to the idle labor of walking. His legs, though. 
exceeding short, were sturdy in proportion to the weight they had 
io sustain; so that when erect he had not a little the appearance of 
1s a robustious beer-barrel, standing on skids. His face, that in- 
fallible index of the mind, presented a vast expanse, perfectly 
unfurrowed or deformed by any of those lines and angles which 
disfigure the human countenance with what is termed expression. 
Two small gray eyes twinkled feebly in the midst, like two stars.

mouth, were curiously mottled and streaked with dusky red, like a

His habits were as regular as his person. He daily took his. 
*s four. stated meals, appropriating exactly an hour to each; he 
smoked and doubted eight hours, and he slept the remaining 
twelve of the four and twenty. Such was the renowned Wouter 
Van Twiller—a true philosopher, for his mind was either elevated

% opher would have perplexed his brain, in accounting for its rising. 
above the surrounding atmosphere. 
In his council he presided with great state and solemnity.
-P-A-G-E-567
  550 Junior High School Literature, Book One   
He sat in a huge chair of solid oak, hewn in the celebrated forest 
of the Hague, fabricated by an experienced timmerman of Am- 
sterdam, and curiously carved about the arms and feet, into exact 
imitations of gigantic eagle’s claws. Instead of a scepter, he 
swayed a long Turkish pipe, wrought with jasmine and amber, 
which had been presented to a Stadtholder of Holland, at the 
conclusion of a treaty with one of the petty Barbary powers. In 
this stately chair would he sit, and this magnificent pipe would 
he smoke, shaking his right knee with a constant motion, and 
10 fixing his eye for hours together upon a little print of Amsterdam, 
which hung in a black frame against the opposite wall of the 
council chamber. Nay, it has even been said, that when any 
deliberation of extraordinary length and intricacy was on the 
carpet, the renowned Wouter would absolutely shut his eyes for 
full two hours at a time, that he might not be disturbed by ex- 
ternal objects—and at such times the internal commotion of his 
mind was evinced by certain regular guttural sounds, which his 
admirers declared were merely the noise of conflict, made by his 
contending doubts and opinions. 
20 =‘ It is with infinite difficulty I have been enabled to collect these 
biographical anecdotes of the great man under consideration. 
The facts respecting him were so scattered and vague, and divers 
of them so questionable in point of authenticity, that I have had 
to give up the search after many, and decline the admission ‘of 
still more, which would have tended to heighten the coloring of 
his portrait. 
I have been the more anxious to delineate fully the person 
and habits of the renowned Van Twiller, from the consideration 
that he was not only the first, but also the best governor that ever 
so presided over this ancient and respectable province; and so tran- 
quil and benevolent was his reign, that I do not find throughout 
the whole of it, a single instance of any offender being brought to 
punishment—a most indubitable sign of a merciful governor, and 
a case unparalleled, excepting in the reign of the illustrious King 
38 Log, from whom, it is hinted, the renowned Van Twiller was a 
lineal descendant. 
The very outset of the career of this excellent magistrate was ” a » a
-P-A-G-E-568

distinguished by an example of legal acumen, that gave flattering 
presage of a wise and equitable administration. The morning 
after he had been solemnly installed in office, and at the moment 
that he was making his breakfast, from a prodigious earthen dish, 
5 filled with milk and Indian pudding, he was suddenly interrupted 
by the appearance of one Wandle Schoonhoven, a very important 
old burgher of New-Amsterdam, who complained bitterly of one 
Barent Bleecker, inasmuch as he fraudulently refused to come to 
a settlement of accounts, seeing that there was a heavy balance 
‘8 in favor of the said Wandle. Governor Van Twiller, as I have 
already observed, was a man of few words; he was likewise a 
mortal enemy to multiplying writings—or being disturbed at his 
breakfast. Having listened attentively to the statement of 
Wandle Schoonhoven, giving an occasional grunt, as he shoveled 
8 a spoonful of Indian pudding into his mouth—either as a sign that 
he relished the dish, or comprehended the story—he called unto 
him his constable, and pulling out of his breeches pocket a huge 
jack-knife, despatched it after the defendant as a summons, ac- 
companied by his tobacco-box as a warrant. 
* This summary process was as effectual in those simple. days 
as was the seal ring of the great Haroun Alraschid among the 
true believers. The two parties being confronted before him, 
each produced a book of accounts written in a language and char- 
acter that would have puzzled any but a High Dutch commen- 
* tator, or a learned decipherer of Egyptian obelisks, to understand. 
The sage Wouter took them one after the other, and having 
poised them in his hands, and attentively counted over the number 
of leaves, fell straightway into a very great doubt, and smoked 
for half an hour without saying a word; at length, laying his 
¥ finger beside his nose, and shutting his eyes for a moment, with 
the air of a man who has just caught @ subtle idea by the tail, he 
slowly took his pipe from his mouth, puffed forth a column of 
tobaeco-smoke, and with marvelous gravity and solemnity pre- 
nounced—that having carefully counted over the leaves and- 
% weighed the books, it was found, that one was just as thick and 
as heavy as the other—therefore it was the final opinion of the 
court that the accounts were equally balanced—therefore Wandle
-P-A-G-E-569
“~. 10 
  552 Junior High School Literature, Book One   
should give Barent a receipt, and Barent should give Wandle a 
receipt—and the constable should pay the costs. 
This decision being straightway made known, diffused general 
joy throughout New-Amsterdam, for the people immediately per- 
ceived that they had a very wise and equitable magistrate to rule 
over them. But its happiest effect was, that not another law-suit 
took place throughout the whole of his administration—and the 
office of constable fell into such decay that there was not one of 
those losel scouts known in the province for many years. I am 
the more particular in dwelling on this transaction, not only 
because I deem it one of the most sage and righteous judgments 
on record, and well worthy the attention of modern magistrates, 
but because it was a miraculous event in the history of the re- 
nowned Wouter-—being the only time he was ever known to come 
to a decision in the whole course of his life.

This morning as I passed into the Land Office, the Flag

Theard it say: “Good morning, Mr. Flag Maker.” 
“I beg your pardon, Old Glory,” I said; “aren’t you mistaken?

NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Biography. Walt Whitman (1819-1892) was born in Huntington, Long 
Island, and educated in the public schools of Brooklyn. He left school at 
the early age of thirteen to make his own way in life. At different times 
he was school teacher, carpenter, builder, journalist, and ‘poet. During’ 
the Civil War he became a volunteer nurse in and about Washington, D. C., 
and the story of his unselfish hospital service is one of the most inspiring 
that has come down to us from that war. Lincoln said of him, “Well, he 
looks like a man!” 
Two points about Whitman are worthy of notice. The first is that he 
was 3 man of intensely democratic sympathies. He wrote of “the dear love 
of eomrades” as the real means for bringing about a better understanding 
among men of every nation, a better government, and the end of war. 
He loved every part of America, and all America’s sons and daughters.

  The word “democracy” constantly occurs in his poetry and his prose, and by 
it he means the cultivation of love and codperation among men. He had 
a vision of the time when autocratic government, and all forms of selfish- 
ness, should cease among men; like Burns, he dwelt on the time when men 
all over the world should be brothers. : 
The second point is closely related to the first. In his dislike for con- 
ventional atid exclusive life he objected even to the form developed for 
poetry through centuries. He was a lover of freedom, even in writing. So 
he rarely uses rimes and stanzas. He calls his form “chants,” and so they 
are, chants of human brotherhood and sympathy. .

THE BEANFIELD 
HENRY D. THOREAU 
Before I finished my house, wishing to earn ten or twelve 
dollars by some honest and agreeable method, in order to meet 
my unusual expenses, I planted about two acres and a half chiefly 
with beans, but a small part with potatoes, corn, peas, and turnips. 
s Meanwhile my beans, the length of whose rows, added te- 
gether, was seven miles, were impatient to be hoed, for the earliest 
had grown considerably before the latest were in the ground; 
indeed they were not easily to be put off. What was the meaning 
of this so steady and self-respecting, this small Herculean labor, 
« I knew nat. I came to love my rows, my beans, though so many 
more than I wanted. They attached me to the earth, and se I 
got strength like Antaeus. But why should I raise them? Only 
Heaven knows. This was my curious labor all summer—to make 
this portion of the earth’s surface, which had yielded enly cinque- 
migy' et

  foil, blackberries, johnswort, and the like, before, sweet wild fruits 
and pleasant flowers, produce instead this pulse. What shall I 
learn of beans or beans of me? I cherish them, I hoe them, early 
and late | have an eye to them; and this is my day’s work. It isa 
fine broad leaf to lcok on. My auxiliaries are the dews and rains 
which water this dry soil, and what fertility is in the scil itself, 
which for the most part is lean and effete. My enemies are worms, 
cool days and, most of all, woodehucks. The last have nibbled 
for me a quarter of an acre clean. But what right had I to oust 
johnswort and the rest, and break up their ancient herb garden? 
Socn, however, the remaining beans will be too tough for them, 
and go forward to meet new foes. 
I planted about two acres and a half of upland. Before any 
woodchuck or squirrel had rum across the road, or the sun had 
gotten above the shrub-oaks, while all the dew was on—I would 
advise you to do all your work if possible while the dew is on— 
T began to level the ranks of haughty weeds in my beanfield and 
to throw dust upon their heads. Early in the morning I worked 
barefooted, dabbling like a plastic artist in the dewy and crum- 
bling sand, but later in the day the sun blistered my feet. The 
sun lighted me to hoe beans, pacing slowly backward and forward 
over that yellow gravelly upland, between the long green rows, 
fifteen rods, the one end terminating in a shrub-oak copse where I 
could rest in the shade’the other in a blackberry field where the 
green berries deepened their tints by the time I had made another 
round. Removing the weeds putting fresh soil about the bean 
stems and encouraging this weed which I had sown, making the 
vellow soil express its summer thought in bean leaves and blos- 
soms rather than in wormwood and piper and millet grass, making 
the earth say beans instead of grass—this was my daily work. As 
IT had little aid from horses or cattle, or hired men or boys, or 
improved implements of husbandry, I was much slower, and be- 
eame much more intimate with my beans than usual. 
It was a singular experience, that long acquaintane®& which I 
cultivated with beans, what with planting, and hoeing, and har- 
vesting, and threshing, and picking over and selling them—the 
last was the hardest of al—I might add eating for I did taste.
-P-A-G-E-578
  The Beanfield 561 
  I was determined to know beans. When they were growing, I used 
to-hoe from five o’clock in the morning till noon, and commonly 
spent the rest of the day about other affairs. Consider the inti- 
mate and curious acquaintance one makes with various kinds of 
s weeds. That’s Roman wormwood—that’s pigweed—that’s sorrel 
—that’s piper-grass—have at him, chop him up, turn his roots 
upward to the sun, don’t let him have a fiber in the shade; if you 
do he’ll turn himself t’other side up and be as green as a leek in 
two days. A long war, not with cranes, but with weeds, those 
© Trojans who had sun and rain and dews on their side.’ Daily the 
beans saw me come to their rescue armed with a hoe, and thin’ 
the ranks of their enemies, filling up the trenches with weedy 
dead. Many a lusty crest-waving Hector, that towered a whole 
foot above his crowding comrades, fell before my weapon and 
rolled in the dust. . 
My farm outgoes for the season were, for implements, seed, 
work, etc., $14.72%. I got twelve bushels of beans and eighteen. 
bushels of potatoes, besides some peas and sweet corn. The 
yellow corn and turnips were too late to come to anything. My 
:» whole income from the farm was— a. 
  $23.44 
Deducting the outgoes............2. 14.7215 
There are left............... ene eee $ 8.71% 
s This is the result of my experience in raising beans. Plant 
the common small white bush bean about the first of June, in 
rows three feet by eightcen inches apart, being careful to select 
fresh, round, and unmixed seed. First look out for worms, and 
supply vacancies by planting anew. Then look out for wood- 
chucks, if it is an exposed place, for they will nibble off the 
earliest tender leaves almost clean as they go; and again, when 
the young tendrils make their appearance, they have notice of it, | 
and will shear them off with both buds and young pods, sitting 
erect like a squirrel. But above all, harvest as early as possible, 
8 if you would escape frosts and have a fair and salable crop; you 
may save much loss by this means. &

  NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Biography. Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862 )was born in Concord, 
Massachusetts, and was educated in the village schools and later at Harvard 
University. He was an intimate friend of Emerson, Hawthorne, and the 
Alcotts. With the help of Emerson, he built a cottage beside a pond in 
Walden Woods near Concord where he lived alone, planted beans, caught 
fish, and for the most part lived on the products of the soil, cultivated by his 
own hands. In his book, Walden, or Life in the Woods, he gives a detailed 
account of his observations and, experiences. Other books by Thoreau are 
A Week on the Concord and the Merrimack Rivers, The Maine Woods, etc. 
Discussion. 1, Why did Thoreau wish to earn some extra money? 2. 
What seeds did he plant? 3. The author likens the hoeing of the beans 
to a “Herculean labor”; explain this reference. 4. What were Thoreau’s 
auxiliaries? His enemies? 5. According to the author, what is the best 
time to work in the garden? 6. How did he come “to know beans” so 
well? 7. Explain the metaphor referring to the weeds as Trojans. 8. How 
much did the author clear on his garden? 9. Do you think the --ouat

The sky is ruddy in the east, 
The earth is gray below, 
And, spectral in the river-mist,

The broad-axe to the gnarléd oak,

Hark !|—roars the bellows, blast on blast, 
The sooty smithy jars, 
And fire-sparks, rising far and fast, 
Are fading with the stars. 
All day for us the smith shall stand 
Beside that flashing forge; 
All day for us his heavy hand 
The groaning anvil scourge. 
From far-off hills, the panting team 
For us is toiling near; 
For us the raftsmen down the stream 
Their island barges steer. 
Rings out for us the ax-man’s stroke 
In forests old and still— 
For us the century-circled oak 
Falls crashing down his hill. 
Up!—up!—in nobler toil than ours 
No craftsmen bear a part; 
We make of Nature’s giant powers 
The slaves of human Art. 
Lay rib to rib and beam to beam, 
And drive the treenails free; 
Nor faithless joint nor yawning seam 
Shall tempt the searching sea! 
Where’er the keel of our good ship 
The sea’s rough field shall plow, 
Where’er her tossing spars shall drip 
With salt-spray caught below, . 
That ship must heed her master’s beck, 
Her helm obey his hand, 
And seamen tread her reeling deck 
As if they trod the land.

Ho!—strike away the bars and blocks,

Why lingers on these dusty rocks 
The young bride of the sea? 
Look! how she moves adown the Brooves, 
In graceful beauty now! 
How lowly on the breast she loves 
Sinks down her virgin prow! 
God bless her! wheresoe’er the breeze 
Her snowy wing shall fan, 
Aside the frozen Hebrides, 
Or sultry Hindostan! 
Where’er, in mart or on the main, 
With peaceful flag unfurled, 
She helps to wind the silken chain 
Of commerce round the world! 
Be hers the Prairie’s golden grain, 
The Desert’s golden sand, 
The clustered fruits of sunny Spain, 
The spice of Morning-land!

May blessings follow free, 
And glad hearts welcome back again 
Her white sails from the sea!

THE BUILDERS 
HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW 
All are architects of Fate, 
Working in these walls of Time; 
Some with massive deeds and great, 
Some with ornaments of rime. 
Nothing useless is, or low; 
Each thing in its place is best; ~ 
And what seems but idle show 
Strengthens and supports the rest. 
For the structure that we raise 
Time is with materials filled; 
Our todays and yesterdays 
Are the blocks with which we build. 
Truly shape and fashion these; 
Leave no yawning gaps between; 
Think not, because no man sees, 
Such things will remain unseen, 
In the elder days of Art, 
Builders wrought with greatest care 
Each minute and unseen part; 
For the gods see everywhere. 
Let us do our work as well, 
Both the unseen and the seen; 
Make the house, where gods may dwell, 
Beautiful, entire, and clean.

Historical Note. Old Ironsides was the popular name given the U. 8, 
frigate Constitution. It was proposed by the Secretary of the Navy to dis- 
pose of the ship, as it had become unfit for service. Popular sentiment did 
not approve of this; it was felt that a ship which had been the pride of the 
nation should continue to be the property of the Navy and that it should 
be rebuilt for service when needed. Holmes wrote this poem at the time 
when the matter was being widely discussed.

motive which inspired it? 3. Do you think the poet really means it when

as an inanimate object or does it seem personified? 5. What is meant by

THE AMERICAN FLAG 
HENRY WARD BEECHER 
A thoughtful mind, when it sees a nation’s flag, se 
flag only, but the nation itself; and whatever may be it 
its insignia, he reads chiefly in the flag the government. 
ciples, the truths, the history, which belong to the nat... 0.0. 
5 sets it forth. 
When the French tricolor rolls out to the wind, we se: 
When the new-found Italian flag is unfurled, ‘we see re: 
Italy. When the other three-cornered Hungarian flag 
lifted to the wind, we shall see in it the long buried but ne 
10 principles of Hungarian liberty. When the united cros¢ 
Andrew and St. George on a fiery ground set forth the b 
Old England, we see not the cloth merely; there rises u 
the mind the noble aspect of that monarchy, which, more! 
other on the globe, has advanced its banner for liberty, 
1s national prosperity. 
This nation has a banner, too; and wherever it streamed 
abroad, men saw daybreak bursting on their eyes, for the Ameri- 
can flag has been the symbol of liberty, and men rejoiced in it. 
Not another flag on the globe had such an errand, or went forth 
+9 upon the sea, carrying everywhere, the world around, such hope 
for the captive, and such glorious tidings. The stars upon it were 
to the pining nations like the morning stars of God, and the stripes 
upon it were beams of morning light. 
As at early dawn the stars stand first, and then it grows light, 
25 and then as the sun advances, that light breaks into banks and 
streaming lines of color, the glowing red and intense white striv- 
ing together and ribbing the horizon with bars effulgent, so on the 
American flag, stars and beams of many-colored light shine out 
together. And wherever the flag comes, and men behold it, they 
80 see in its sacred emblazonry no rampant lion and fierce eagle, but 
only Licut, and every fold significant of liberty.

  The American Flag 573 
  The history of this banner is all on one side. Under it rode 
Washington and his armies; before it Burgoyne laid down his 
arms. It waved on the highlands at West Point; it floated over 
old Fort Montgomery. When Arnold would have surrendered 
sthese valuable fortresses and precious legacies, his night was 
turned into day, and his treachery was driven away by the beams 
of light from this starry banner. 
It cheered our army, driven from New York, in their solitary 
pilgrimage through New Jersey. It streamed in light over Valley 
1 Forge and Morristown. It crossed the waters rolling with ice at 
Trenton; and when its stars gleamed in the cold morning with vic- 
tory, a new day of hope dawned on the despondency of the nation. 
And when, at length, the long years of war were drawing to a close, 
underneath the folds of this immortal banner sat Washington 
s while Yorktown surrendered its hosts, and our Revolutionary 
struggles ended with victory. 
Let us then twine each thread of the glorious tissue of our 
eountry’s flag about our heartstrings; and looking upon our homes 
and catching the spirit that breathes upon us from the battlefields 
» of our fathers, let us resolve, come weal or woe, we will, in life and 
in death, now and forever, stand by the Stars and Stripes. They 
have been unfurled from the snows of Canada to the plains of New 
Orleans, in the halls of the Montezumas and amid the solitude of 
every sea; and everywhere, as the luminous symbol of resistless 
's and beneficent power, they have led the brave to victory and to 
glory. They have floated over our cradles; let it be our prayer 
and our struggle that they shall float over our graves.

THE AMERICAN FLAG 
JOSEPH RODMAN DRAKE 
When Freedom, from her mountain height, 
Unfurled her standard to the air, 
She tore the azure robe of night, 
And set the stars of glory there; 
She mingled with its gorgeous dyes 
The milky baildric of the skies, 
And striped its pure celestial white 
With streakings of the morning light; 
Then, from his mansion in the sun, 
She called her eagle-bearer down, 
And gave into his mighty hand 
The symbol of her chosen land! 
Majestic monarch of the cloud, 
Who rear’st aloft thy regal form, 
To hear the tempest-trumpings loud, 
And see the lightning lances driven, 
When strive the warriors of the sterm, 
And roils the thunder-drum of heaven—
-P-A-G-E-592
The American Flag 575 
  Child of the sun! to thee ’tis given 
To guard the banner ef the free, 
To hover in the sulphur smoke, 
To ward away the battle-stroke, 
And bid its blendings shine afar, 
Like rainbows on the eloud of war, 
The harbingers of victory! 
Flag of the brave! thy folds shall fly, 
The sign of hope and triumph high, 
When speaks the signal trumpet tone, 
And the long line comes gleaming on, 
Ere yet the life-blood, warm and wet, 
Has dimmed the glistening bayonet, 
Each soldier’s eye shall brightly turn 
To where thy sky-born glories burn; 
And as his springing steps advance, 
Cateh war and vengeance from the glance. 
And when the cannon’s mouthings loud, 
Heave in wild wreaths the battle shroud, 
And gory sabers rise and fall, 
Like shoots of flame on midnight’s pall; 
Then shall thy meteor glances glow, 
And cowering foes shall sink below 
Each gallant arm that strikes beneath 
That awful messenger of death. 
Flag of the seas! on ocean’s wave 
Thy stars shall glitter o’er the brave; 
When death, careering on the gale, 
Sweeps darkly round the bellied ‘sail, 
And frighted waves rush wildly back 
Before the broadside’s reeling rack, 
Each dying wanderer of the sea 
Shall look at once to heaven and thee, 
And smile to see thy splendors fly 
Tn triumph o’er his closing eye.
-P-A-G-E-593

Flag of the free heart’s hope and home! 
By angel hands to valor given; 
Thy stars have lit the welkin dome, 
And all thy hues were born in heaven.

With Freedom’s soil beneath our feet, 
And Freedom’s banner streaming o’er us? 
NOTES AND QUESTIONS 
Biography. Joseph Rodman Drake (1795-1820), whose name is insepara- 
bly associated with that of his friend, Fitz-Greene Halleck, was an American 
poet. These two able poets together contributed a series of forty poems to 
the New York Evening Post. Among these was “The American Flag,” the 
last four lines of which were written by Halleck, to replace those written by 
Drake: 
“As fixed as yonder orb divine, 
That saw thy bannered blaze unfurled, 
Shall thy proud stars resplendent shine, 
The guard and glory of the world.” 
Drake was a youth of many graces of both mind and body, who wrote 
verses as a, bird sings—for the pure joy of it. His career was cut short 
by death when he was only twenty-five years old. Of him Halleck wrote: 
“None knew thee but to love thee, 
Nor named thee but to praise.”

' THE FLAG GOES BY 
HENRY H. BENNETT 
Hats off! 
Along the street there comes 
A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums, 
A flash of color beneath the sky. 
Hats off! 
The flag is passing by! 
Blue and crimson and white it shines, 
Over the steel-tipped, ordered lines. 
Hats off! 
The colors before us fly; 
But more than the flag is passing by. 
Sea fights and land fights, grim and great, 
Fought to make and to save the State; 
Weary marches and sinking ships; 
Cheers of victory on dying lips; 
Days of plenty and years of peace; 
March of a strong land’s swift increase; 
Equal justice, right and law, 
Stately honor and reverend awe; 
Sign of a nation, great and strong 
To ward her people from foreign wrong; 
Pride and glory and honor—all 
Live in the colors to stand or fall. 
Hats off! 
Along the street there comes 
A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums; 
And loyal hearts are beating high: 
Hats off!

O say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light, 
What so proudly we hailed, at the twilight’s last gleaming? 
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight, 
O’er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming; 
5 And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air, 
Gave proof through the ‘night that our flag was still there. 
O say, does that Star-Spangled Banner yet wave 
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave? 
On that shore, dimly seen through the mist of the deep, 
10 Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes, 
What is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep, 
As it fitfully blows, now conceals, now discloses?

CITIZENSHIP 
WILLIAM P. FRYE 
Citizenship! What is citizenship? It has a broader signifi- 
cation than you and I are apt to give it. Citizenship does not 
mean alone that the man who possesses it shall be obedient to the 
law, shall be kindly to his neighbors, shall regard the rights of » 
5 others, shall perform his duties as juror, shall, if the hour of peril 
come, yield his time, his property, and his life to his country.. It 
means more than that. It means that his country shall protect 
him in every right which the Constitution gives him. What right 
has the Republic to demand his life, his property, in the hour of 
to peril, if, when his hour of peril comes, it fails him? A man died 
in England a few years ago, Lord Napier of Magdala, whose death 
reminded me of an incident which illustrates this, an incident 
which gave that great lord his name. A few years ago King 
Theodore of Abyssinia seized-Captain Cameron, a British citizen,

Theodore refused. England fitted out and sent on five thousand 
,; English soldiers, and ten thousand Sepoys, debarked them on the 
| coast, marched them more than four hundred miles through swamp 
s and morass under a burning sun. Then they marched up the 
mountain height, they scaled the walls, they broke down the iron 
gates, they reached down into the dungeon, they took. that one 
British citizen like a brand from the burning and carried him 
down the mountain side, across the morass, put him on board the 
10 white-winged ship, and bore him away to England to safety. 
| That cost Great Britain millions of dollars, and it made General 
Napier Lord Napier of Magdala. 
\ Was not that a magnificent thing for a great country. to do? 
Only think of-it! A country that has an eye sharp enough to see 
13 away across the ocean, away across the morass, away up into the 
mountain top, away down into the dungeon, one citizen, one of 
her thirty millions, and then has an arm strong enough to reach 
away across the ocean, away across the morass, away up the 
mountain height and down into the dungeon and take that one and 
* bear him home in safety. Who would not live and die, too, for 
the country that can do that? This country of ours is worth our 
thought, our care, our labor, our lives. What a magnificent 
country it is! What a Republic for the people, where all are 
kings! Men of great wealth, of great rank, of great influence can 
% live without difficulty under despotic power; but how can you and 
I, how can the average man endure the burdens it imposes? Oh, 
this blessed Republic of ours stretches its hand down to men; and 
lifts them up, while despotism puts its heavy hand on their heads 
and presses them down! This blessed Republic of ours speaks to 
% every boy in the land, black or white, rich or poor, and asks him 
to come up higher and higher. -You remember that boy out here 
on the prairie, the son of a widowed mother, poor, neglected per- 
haps by all except the dear old mother. But the Republic did not 
neglect him. The Republic said to that boy: ‘Boy, there is a 
% ladder: its foot is on the earth, its top is in the sky: Boy, go up.” 
And the boy mounted that ladder rung by rung; by the rung of 
the free schools, by the rung of the academy, by the rung of the

by the rung of the United States House of Representatives, by the 
rung of the United States Senate, by the rung of the Presidency of 
the Great Republic, by the rung of a patient sickness and a heroic 
death; until James A. Garfield is a name to be forever honored in 
the history of our country. 
Now, is not a Republic like that worth the tribute of our con- 
science? Is it not entitled to our best thought, to our holiest 
purpose? 
Let us pledge ourselves to give it our loyal service and support 
until every man in this Republic, black or white, shall be protected 
in all the rights which the Constitution of the United States 
bestows upon him.

The Magdala affair is a striking example of what a country will do to 
protect its citizens. Magdala, more properly Makdala, is a natural strong- 
hold in Abyssinia. The emperor Theodore of Abyssinia chose it as a 
fortress and a prison. Having taken offense because a request that English 
workmen and machinery be sent him was not promptly complied with, 
Theodore seized the British consul, Captain C. D. Cameron, his suite, and 
two other men, and imprisoned them at Magdala. Lieutenant-General 
Robert Napier was sent to rescue the prisoners. For his services in this 
expedition Napier received the thanks of Parliament, a pension, and a 
peerage, with the title First Baron Napier of Magdala.

  The Character of Washington . 583 
THE CHARACTER OF WASHINGTON 
THOMAS JEFFERSON 
I think I knew General Washington intimately and thor- 
oughly, and were I called on to delineate his character, it should 
be in terms like these: 
His mind was great and powerful, without being of the very 
| 5 first order; his penetration strong, though not so acute as.that of 
a Newton, Bacon, or Locke, and as far as he saw, no judgment 
| was ever sounder. It was slow in operation, being little aided by 
j invention or imagination, but sure in conclusion. Hence the com- 
mon remark of his officers, of the advantage he derived from 
1 councils of war, where, hearing all suggestions, he selected what- 
ever was best; and certainly no general ever planned his battles 
more judiciously. But if deranged during the course of the action, 
if any member of his plan was dislocated by sudden circumstances, 
he was slow in readjustment. The consequence was that he often 
13 failed in the field, and rarely against an enemy in station, as at 
Boston and New York. He was incapable of fear, meeting per- 
sonal dangers with the calmest unconcern. 
Perhaps the strongest feature in his character was prudence; 
never acting until everv circumstance, every consideration, was 
* maturely weighed; refraining if he saw a doubt, but, when once 
decided, going through with his purpose whatever obstacles op- - 
posed. His integrity was most pure, his justice the most inflex- 
ible I have ever known, no motives of interest or consanguinity, 
of friendship, or hatred, being able to bias his decision. He was, 
% indeed, in every sense of the words, a wise, a good, and’a great 
man. His temper was naturally irritable and high-toned; but 
reflection and resolution had obtained a firm and habitual ascend- 
ancy over it. If ever, however, it broke its bounds, he was most 
tremendous in his wrath. 
#» In his expenses he was honorable, but exact; liberal in con- 
| tribution to whatever promised utility, but frowning and unyield-
-P-A-G-E-601

S 
a

  584 Junior High School Literature, Book One 
  
ing on all visionary projects and all unworthy calls on his charity. 
His heart was not warm in its affections; but he exactly calculated 
every man’s value, and gave him a solid esteem proportioned to it. 
His person, you know, was fine, his stature exactly what one could 
wish, his deportment easy, erect, and noble; the best horseman of 
his age, and the most graceful figure that could be seen on horse- 
back. 
Although in the circle of his friends, where he might be unre- 
served with safety, he took a free share in conversation, his col- 
loquial talents were not above mediocrity, possessing neither 
copiousness of ideas nor fluency of words. In public, when called 
on for a sudden opinion, he was unready, short, and embarrassed. 
.Yet he wrote readily, rather. diffusely, in an easy and correct 
style. This he had acquired by conversation with the. world, for 
his education was merely reading, writing, and common arith- 
metic, to which he added surveying at a later day. 
His time was employed in action chiefly, reading little, and 
that only in agriculture and English history. His correspondence 
became necessarily extensive, and, with journalizing his agricul- 
tural proceedings, occupied most of his leisure hours within-doors. 
On the whole, his character was, in its mass, perfect, in nothing 
bad, in few points indifferent; and it may truly be said that never 
did nature and fortune combine more perfectly to make a man 
great, and to place him in the same constellation with whatever 
worthies have merited from man an everlasting remembrance. 
‘For his was the singular destiny and merit of leading the 
armies of his country successfully through an arduous war for the 
establishment of its independence; of conducting its councils 
.through the birth of a government, new in its forms and prin- 
ciples, until it had settled down into a quiet and orderly train; 
and of scrupulously obeying the laws through the whole of his 
career, civil and military, of which the history of the world fur- 
nishes no other example.

THE TWENTY-SECOND OF FEBRUARY 
WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT 
Pale is the February sky 
And brief the mid-day’s sunny hours; 
The wind-swept forest seems to sigh 
For the sweet time of leaves and flowers. 
Yet has no month a prouder day, 
Not even when the summer broods 
O’er meadows in their fresh array, 
Or autumn tints the glowing woods. 
For this chill season now again 
Brings, in its annual round, the morn 
When, greatest of the sons of men, 
Our glorious Washington was born. 
Lo, where, beneath an icy shield, 
Calmly the mighty Hudson flows! 
By snow-clad fell and frozen field, 
Broadening, the lordly river goes. 
The wildest storm that sweeps through space, | 
And rends the oak with sudden force, 
Can raise no ripple on his face 
Or slacken his majestic course. 
Thus, ’mid the wreck of thrones, shall live 
Unmarred, undimmed, our hero’s fame, 
And years succeeding years shall give 
Increase of honors to his name.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN 
RICHARD HENRY STODDARD 
This man whose homely face you look upon, 
Was one of Nature’s masterful great men; 
Born with strong arms that unfought victories won. 
Direct of speech, and cunning with the pen, 
Chosen for large designs, he had the art 
Of winning with his humor, and he went 
Straight to his mark, which was the human heart. 
Wise, too, for what he could not break, he bent; 
Upon his back, a more than Atlas load, 
The burden of the Commonwealth was laid;

O CAPTAIN! MY CAPTAIN! 
WALT WHITMAN 
O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done, : 
The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won, 
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting, 
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring; 
But O heart! heart! heart! 
O the bleeding drops of red, 
Where on the deck my Captain lies, 
Fallen cold and dead.

O Captain! My Captain! . 589 
  O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells; 
Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills. : 
For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores 
a-crowding, 
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning; 
Here, Captain! dear father! 
This arm beneath your head! 
It is some dream that on the deck 
You've fallen cold and dead. 
My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still, 
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will, 
The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done, 
From fearful trip the victor ship comes in. with object won; 
Exult, O shores! and ring, O bells! 
But I with mournful tread 
Walk the deck my Captain lies, 
Fallen cold and dead. -.

  IN FLANDERS FIELDS 
LIEUT. COL. JOHN D. McCRAE 
In Flanders fields the poppies blow 
Between the crosses, row on row, 
That mark our place; and in the sky 
The larks still bravely singing fly, 
Scarce heard amidst the guns below. 
We are the dead. Short days ago 
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, 
Loved and were loved, and now we lie 
In Flanders fields. 
Take up our quarrel with the foe! 
To you from falling hands we throw 
The torch. Be yours to hold it high! 
If ye break faith with us who die, 
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow 
In Flanders fields.

Rest ye in peace, ye Flanders:dead. 
The fight that ye so bravely led 
We've taken up. And we will keep

With each a cross to mark his bed, 
And poppies blowing overhead, 
Where once his own lifeblood ran red.

And Freedom’s light shall never die!

_In Flanders fields.

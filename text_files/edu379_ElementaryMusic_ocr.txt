    Do you hear the sound that echoes round, 
Making this earth enchanted ground ? 
Is it spring on the wing, or the wind in the pine, 
Or a bird, half-heard, or a marching line ? 
Is it water flowing, or roses growing, 
A burst of dawn, or the bright day going? 
The fun in the sun where the playgrounds are, 
Or fairy fiddlers, shrill and far? 
Is it winter, who enters with trumpets bold, 
Or dancers tripping to tunes.of old? 
The starry flag that passes by, 
Or the call of the sea when the tide is high ? 
It is all of these—in songs that spring 
From the hearts of children who love to sing.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
In the preparation of this book the editors have profited much from the valuable 
codperation of Miss Helen S. Leavitt. In the delicate and technical problems 
presented by the relations of the psychology of music and the psychology of the 
child they have been advised by Professor Henry T. Moore, head of the Department 
of Psychology of Dartmouth College. The editors must add their word of apprecia- 
tion for the service of Miss M. Louise Baum in literary criticism and for the artistic 
Preface poem. 
It is impossible to name all the music educators who have rendered valuable assist- 
ance through constructive suggestions, but to all of them the editors are grateful.

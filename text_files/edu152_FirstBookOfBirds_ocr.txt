PREFACE 
Tuts book is intended to interest young peo- 
ple in the ways and habits of birds, and to stim- 
ulate them to further study. It has grown out 
of my experience in talking to schools. From 
the youngest kindergarten scholar to boys and 
girls of sixteen and eighteen, I have never failed 
to find young people intensely interested so long 
as I would tell them about how the birds live. 
Some of the results of these talks that have 
come to my knowledge have been astonishing 
and far-reaching, such as that of one boy of 
seven or eight, who persuaded the village boys 
around his summer home to give up taking eggs 
and killing birds, and watch them instead, and 
who was dubbed “ Professor ” by his eager fol- 
lowers. The effect has always been to make 
children love and respect the living bird. 
It has therefore seemed to me that what is 
needed at first is not the science of ornithology,

— however diluted, — but some account of the 
life and habits, to arouse sympathy and interest 
in the living bird, neither as a target nor as a 
producer of eggs, but as a fellow-creature whose 
acquaintance it would be pleasant to make. 
With this purpose in view I have expanded 
my “ Children’s Talks” into this little book, to 
be used as an introduction to one of the most 
fascinating and delightful of studies. 
I hope it is unnecessary to say that I have 
been careful to have the latest and the best 
authorities for the statements made, and I take 
pleasure in presenting a list of them : —

WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW 
Birps seem to be the happiest creatures on 
earth, yet they have none of what we — the 
comforts of life. . 
They have no houses to live in, no beds to 
sleep on, no breakfast and dinner provided : for 
them, 
This book is to tell something about them; 
where they live and what they eat, where they 
sleep, how they get their beautiful dress, and 
many other things. But no one can tell all 
about their lives and habits, for no one knows 
all their ways. 
Men who study dead birds can tell how they 
are made, how their bones are put together, and 
how many feathers there are in the wings and tail. 
Of course it is well to know these things. But
-P-A-G-E-14
  2 THE FIRST BOOK OF BIRDS © 
to see how birds live is much more interesting 
than to look at dead ones. 
It is pleasant to see how mother birds build 
their nests, and how they take care of their 
nestlings. It is charming to see the young ones 
when they begin to fly, and to know how they 
are taught to find their food, and to keep out 
of danger, and to sing, and everything young 
birds need to know. 
Then when they are grown up, it is interest. 
ing to find out where they go in winter, and 
why they do not stay with us all the year round. 
One who goes into the field to watch and 
study their ways will be surprised to find how 
much like people they act. And after studying 
living birds, he will never want to kill them. 
I¢ will seem to him almost like murder.

WHEN THEY COME IN THE SPRING 
Ty the long, cold winter of the New England 
and Middle States, not many birds are usually 
seen. In the cities there is always the English 
sparrow, and in the country, now and then a 
chickadee, or a woodpecker, or a small flock of 
goldfinches. 
But very early in the spring, long before grass 
is green, even while snow is on the ground, the ~ 
birds begin to come. 
Some morning a robi¥’ will appear, standing 
up very straight on a fence or tree, showing his 
bright red breast and black cap, flirting his tail, 
and looking as if he were glad to be back in his ' 
old home. 
Then perhaps the same day will come the 
hoarse chack of a blackbird, and two or three will 
fly over and alight in a big bare tree, looking, it 
may be, for a good place to build a bird city. 
Soon will be heard the sweet little song of the 
song sparrow or the bluebird, and then we shall” 
°

  4 THE FIRST BOOK OF BIRDS 
know that summer is coming, for these are the 
first birds of spring. 
Day after day, as the snow melts away and 
the sunshine grows hotter, more birds will come. 
One day a catbird or two, another day an oriole 
in black and gold, and another day a pert little 
wren. So it will go on, till by the time June 
comes in, all our birds will be back with us, very 
busy, hopping around in our bushes and trees, 
making their nests all about, and singing the 
whole day long. 
Almost the first thing every bird thinks of, 
when he comes to us, is making the nest. For 
summer is the only time in his life that a bird 
has a home. 
He does not need a house to live in. He 
cares nothing for a roof to cover him, because 
when the sun is hot, he has the broad green 
leaves on the trees to shade him. And when it 
rains his neat feather coat is like a waterproof 
that lets the drops run off, leaving him warm 
and dry under it. 
He does not need a dining-room, because he 
eats wherever he finds his food, and he wants no 
kitchen, because he prefers his food raw. 
He has no use for a bedroom, because he can 
sleep on any twig; the whole world is his bed- 
room.

  i. WHEN THEY COME IN THE SPRING 5 
He cares nothing for closets and bureaus, 
because he has only one suit of clothes at a 
time, and he washes and dries that without tak- 
ing it off. 
He wants no fire to keep him warm, for when 
it is too cold he spreads his wings and flies to a ” 
warmer place.) A bird has really no need of 
a house, — excepting when he is a baby, be- 
fore his eyes are open, or his feathers have 
come, or his wings have grown. While he is 
blind, naked, and hungry, he must have a warm, 
snug cradle. 
So when the bird fathers and mothers come 
in the spring the first thing they do is to find 
good places and build nice cradles, for they are 
very fond of their little ones. They spend the 
spring and summer in working for them, keep- 
ing them warm, feeding them till they are 
grown up, and then teaching them to fly and to 
take care of themselves, so that when summer is 
gone they will be ready to go with the other 
birds to their winter home.

THE BIRD’S HOME 
Eacu bird mother has her own way of mak- ‘ 
ing the nest,\ but there is one thing almost all of 
them try to-do, and that is to hide it. 
They cannot put their little-homes out in 
plain sight, as we do our houses, because so 
many creatures want to rob them. Squirrels 
and snakes and rats, and some big birds, and 
cats and many others, like to eat eggs and young 
birds. 
So most birds try, first of all, to find good 
hiding-places. Some tiny warblers go to the , 
tops of the tallest trees, and hide the nest among 
the leaves. ‘Orioles hang the swinging cradle at’ 
the end of a branch, where cats and snakes and 
naughty boys cafinot come. Song——sparrows 
tuck the little home in a tuft of weeds, on the 
ground, and bobolinks hide it in the deep grass. 
After a safe place is found, they have to get 
something to build of. They hunt all about 
and gather small twigs, or grass stems, or fine 
   
-P-A-G-E-24
10 THE FIRST BOOK OF BIRDS 
rootlets, and pull narrow strips of bark off the 
grapevines and the birch-trees, or they pick up 
strings and horsehairs, and many other things. 
Robins and swallows use mud. 
As they go on building, the mother bird gets 
inside and turns around and around to make it 
fit her form, and be smooth and comfortable for 
her to sit in. 
When a nest is made, it must be lined. Then 
some birds go to the chicken yard, and pick up 
feathers, and others find horsehairs. Some of 
them pull off the soft down that grows on 
plants, or get bits of wool from the sheep pas- 
ture, or old leaves from the woods, and make it 
soft and warm inside. 
Some bird homes are only platforms, where 
it seems as if the eggs must roll off, and others 
are deep burrows, or holes in the ground, where 
no one can get in. Some are dainty baskets 
hung between two twigs, and others are tiny 
cups of felt with lichens outside. 
Each species of bird builds in its own way. 
There are as many different ways to make nests 
as there are kinds of birds to make them. 
Then after all the trouble birds have taken to 
build a nest, they seldom use it a second time.| 
If a pair have two broods in a season, they 
almost always build a new one for each family.
-P-A-G-E-25
  THE BIRD'S HOME ii 
A few birds, such as eagles, owls, and some- 
times orioles, and others, repair the home and 
use it again, and woodpeckers sometimes nest in 
the old holes.. But generally, after the young 
birds have-flown, we may be sure the nest will 
not be wanted again. 
When the nest is finished, the eggs are laid 
in it, one by one. We all know how pretty 
birds’ eggs are. Some are snowy white, some 
are delicate pink, and some blue. Many have 
tiny dots and specks on them, and a few are 
covered with queer-looking streaks and lines. 
But pretty as they are, I think no one would be 
so cruel as to take them away from the poor 
little mother, if he remembered that her young 
ones are inside them, and, that she loves them as 
his own mother loves him. 
I have heard people say that birds do not 
care for their eggs. Let me tell you what a 
little chickadee mother did when a man tried to 
steal the eggs out of her nest. 
The nest was in a hole in an old stump, and 
the man could not get his hand in, so he had to 
take them out one at a time with a little scoop. 
At first the mother flew at him and tried to 
drive him away. Then chickadees and other 
birds who lived near came to help her. All 
flew about his face with cries, so that he had to
-P-A-G-E-26
  12 THE FIRST BOOK OF BIRDS 
use one hand to keep them away from his eyes. 
But still he went on taking out the eggs. 
At last the little mother was so wild with 
grief that she dashed into the hole and sat there 
in the doorway, right before his face. He could 
not get another egg without hurting her, and he 
was ashamed to do that. 
This was as brave in the tiny creature as it 
would be for a human mother to throw herself 
before a fierce, hungry tiger. Do you think 
she did not care for her eggs?
-P-A-G-E-27
  
IV 
THE BABY BIRD 
A sasy bird, as you know, always comes out 
of an egg. And beautiful as these eggs are, 
they are most interesting when you think that 
each one holds a tiny bird. 
Eggs are not all alike, of course. One the 
size of a bean is large enough to hold a hum- 
mingbird baby, till it is old enough to come 
out. But the young ostrich needs a shell nearly 
as big as your head. So there are all sizes of 
eggs to fit the different sizes of birds. 
If you should break a fresh egg you would 
not see a bird, for it would not be formed at 
that time. After the egg is laid in its soft bed, 
it has to be kept warm for many days, and that 
is why the mother bird sits on her nest so 
quietly. She is keeping the eggs warm, so that 
the little ones will form and grow, till they are 
as big as the shells can hold. 
While the mother is sitting her mate does all 
he can to help, though each species has its own 
   
-P-A-G-E-28
  14 THE FIRST BOOK OF BIRDS 
way. The blue jay brings food to his mate, so 
that she need not leave the nest at all, and many 
others do so. But the kingbird-father simply 
watches the nest to protect it while the mother 
goes for food. A redstart gets into the nest 
himself, to keep the eggs warm while his mate is 
gone, and a goldfinch coaxes his mate to go off 
with him for a lunch, leaving nest and eggs to 
take care of themselves. 
Another thing the father birds do is to sing? 
This is the time when we hear so much bir 
song. The singers have little to do but to wait, 
and so they please themselves, and their mates, 
and us too, by singing a great deal. 
When the little birds begin to be cramped, 
and find their cradle too tight, they peck at the 
shell with a sort of tooth that grows on the end 
of the beak, and is called the “egg tooth.” 
This soon breaks the shell, and they come out. 
Then the mother or father carefully picks up 
the pieces of shell, carries them off, and throws 
them away, leaving only the little ones in the 
nest. Perhaps you have found these broken 
shells on the ground sometimes, and could not 
guess how they came there. When the bird- 
lings break out of their prison they do not all 
look the same. Ducks and geese and chickens 
and quails, and other birds who live on the
-P-A-G-E-29
THE BABY BIRD 15 
ground, as well as hawks and owls, are dressed 
in pretty suits of down. They have their eyes 
open, and the ground birds are ready to run 
about at once. 
A man who studied birds, once saw a young 
duck get its first suit of down. He picked up 
the egg just as the little bird inside was trying 
to get out. In a few minutes the shell fell 
apart, and out stepped the duckling on his hand. 
It seemed to be covered with coarse black hairs, 
which in a moment began to burst open, one by 
one, and out of each came a soft fluff of down. 
So in a few minutes, while the man stood there 
and held him, the little duck was all covered 
with his pretty dress. 
But most birds hatched in nests in trees and 
bushes, like robins and bluebirds, are very dif- 
ferent. When they come out of their shells 
they are naked, have their eyes shut, and look 
as if they were nearly all mouth. A young 
hummingbird looks about as big as a honey 
bee, and a robin baby not much bigger than the 
eggshell he came out of. 
They lie flat down in the nest, seeming to be 
asleep most of the time. All they want is to be 
warm and to be fed. 
To keep them warm, the mother sits on them 
a great part of the time, and for the first few
-P-A-G-E-30
16 THE FIRST BOOK OF BIRDS 
days of their lives, the father often brings most 
of the food. Sometimes he gives it to the 
mother, and she feeds the little ones. But 
sometimes she gets off the nest, and flies away 
to rest, and get something to eat for herself, 
while he feeds the nestlings. 
There is one bird father who — it is thought 
— never comes to the nest, either to watch the 
eggs or to help feed the nestlings. That is our 
hummingbird, the ruby throat. 
We do not know the reason for this, and it 
is not fair to say hard things about him until 
we do. It may be that he thinks his shining 
ruby would show the hiding-place of the nest, 
or it may be that the little mother is not willing 
to have any help. I think this last is the real 
reason, for she has a great deal of spirit, and 
always drives away others from her feeding- 
places. 
Young birds grow very fast, and soon feathers 
begin to come out all over them. They are not 
very pretty at this time.

  Vv 
HOW HE IS FED 
Soon after the young bird comes out of the 
egg, he begins to be hungry. All day long, 
whenever the father or mother comes near, he 
opens his great mouth as wide as he can, to have 
it filled, and the moment he gets his voice he 
cries for food. 
Then the old birds have to work hard. Three 
or four hungry nestlings can keep both father 
and mother busy from morning till night, hunting 
for caterpillars and beetles and grubs and other 
things to feed them. It seems as if the little 
fellows never could get enough to eat. Hach 
swallow baby wants seven or eight hundred small 
flies every day,/and a baby robin needs more 
earthworms in a day than you can hold in your 
hand at once. 
At this time you will see robins hunting over 
the lawn, and carrying great beakfuls of worms 
up to the nest. Bluebirds you will find looking 
in the grass, and sparrows hopping about on the
-P-A-G-E-32
  18 THE FIRST BOOK OF BIRDS 
ground, all seeking soft worms and grubs and 
insects for the nestlings; and they are so busy 
they do not get much time for singing. 
At this time the orioles go all over the or- 
chard trees looking for tiny worms, and little 
warblers seek them under every leaf. 
Woodpeckers find the insects hidden behind 
the bark of trees, by cutting holes through it. 
Chickadees and nuthatches pick the tiniest insect 
eggs out of the crevices, and flickers hunt every- 
where for ants. 
As soon as one of the old birds has his mouth 
full, he flies to the nest to feed the young. 
But not all birds feed in the same way. A 
robin just drops a big earthworm, or a part of 
one, into the gaping baby mouth. . Many other 
birds do so also. Sometimes, when an insect is 
too big or too hard, they beat it till it is soft, 
or break it up, before giving it to a little one. 
’ But hummingbird mothers and flicker mo- 
thers have a different way. When they collect 
the food they swallow it, as if they wanted it for 
themselves. Then they go to the nest, and jerk 
it up again in mouthfuls, and feed the nestlings. 
This is called feeding by “regurgitation,” or 
“ throwing up.” 
The way they give the food is very curious. 
They push their long beaks into the nestling’s
-P-A-G-E-33
  HOW HE IS FED 19 
throat, and poke the food far down; so the 
young one does not even have the trouble of 
swallowing. 
This looks as if it must hurt, but the nestling 
seems to like it, and is always ready for more. , 
The pigeon mother lets the young one poke his 
beak down her throat, and get the food for 
himself. 
If the food is hard, like corn, birds who feed 
in this way let it stay in the crop till it is soft 
and better fitted for tender throats, before they 
give it out. 
It is comical to see a nest full of little birds 
when the father or mother comes with food. 
All stretch up and open their big mouths as 
wide as they can, and if they are old enough, 
they cry as if they were starving. 
Some birds bring food enough for all in the 
nest, every time they come. A cedar-bird, feed- 
ing wild cherries, brought five of them every 
time, one for each of the five nestlings. One 
cherry was held in his mouth, but the other 
four were down his throat, and had to be jerked 
up one by one. 
Other birds bring only one mouthful at a 
time, and when there are five or six in the 
nest, they have to make as many journeys before 
all are fed.
-P-A-G-E-34
  20 THE FIRST BOOK OF BIRDS 
Some persons who have studied birds think 
that each nestling is fed in its turn; but they 
look so much alike, and are so close together, 
that it is hard to tell, and I am not sure that 
it is so. 
I will tell you a story I have heard about 
feeding little birds. A child picked up a young 
goldfinch who had fallen out of the nest. He 
took him home and put him into the canary’s 
cage, which was hanging on the front porch. 
Soon the family heard a great noise among 
the birds, and went out to see what was the 
matter. The baby goldfinch had hopped on to 
a perch in the cage, and seemed to be afraid to 
come down, though the old birds had brought 
food for him, and were calling him to take it. 
The canary looked on a while, and then all at 
once he flew to the wires and took the food from 
the birds outside; then he went back to the 
perch beside the little one and gave it to him. 
This he did many times. 
The next day another young goldfinch was 
picked up and put in the cage, and the canary 
took food from the parents and fed both. 
After a few days the old birds came with a 
third little one, and as all were now old enough 
to fly, the cage door was opened, and they all 
flew away.

HIS FIRST SUIT 
( Some birds that live on the ground —as I 
told you — have dresses of down to begin with. 
These little fellows have no warm nest to stay 
in, but run around almost as soon as they come 
out of the egg. Young ducks and geese wear 
this baby suit for weeks, before they begin to put 
on their feather coats. 
Young birds that spend most of their time in 
the water, like grebes, and others that live in a 
cold country, have the down very thick and fine, 
like heavy underclothes, to keep them dry and 
warm. 
Birds whose home is underground, like the 
kingfisher, or in the trunk of a tree, like the 
woodpecker, have hardly any down at all. They 
need no baby clothes in their warm cradles. 
Robins and most other song birds have only 
a little down on them, and very soon the feathers 
' , begin to grow. 
r When the tiny quills push themselves up, they 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  22 THE FIRST BOOK OF BIRDS 
look like little white pins sticking out all over. 
Each bit of down grows out of a little raised 
place on the skin that looks like a pimple, and 
she feather comes out of the same. 
As the feather grows, the bit of down clings 
to it till it is broken off. : Sometimes it holds 
on till the feather is well out. We can often 
see down sticking to a young bird’s feathers. 
The little feathers grow very fast, and before 
he is ready to fly a young bird is well covered. 
Birds hatched with their eyes open, and already 
dressed, who have to run and fly very soon, get 
their wing feathers early; but birds who live 
many days in the nest, like robins and bluebirds, 
do not get theirs till they are nearly grown. 
The tail feathers are the last to come to full 
dength, and you will notice that most birds just 
out ofthe nest have very dumpy tails. 
A bird’s first suit of feathers is called his nest- 
ling plumage. In some families it is just like 
the dress of the grown-up birds, but in others it 
is not at all like that. It is usually worn only 
a few weeks, for the young one outgrows it, ° 
and needs a new and bigger one before winter. 
When a bird is fully dressed, his body is en- 
tirely covered, and it looks as if the feathers 
grew close to each other all over him. But it is 
not so. The feathers grow in patterns, called
-P-A-G-E-37
   
-P-A-G-E-38

-P-A-G-E-39
th. HIS FIRST SUIT 23 
“feather tracts,” with spaces of bare skin be- 
tween them. These bare places do not show, 
because the feathers lap over each other and 
cover them. 
The pattern of the feather tracts is not the 
same in all birds. A few birds of the Ostrich 
family have feathers all over the body. 
There is another curious thing about the nest- 
ling plumage. You would expect a young bird 
to look like,his father or mother; and some of 
them do. -Many nestlings are dressed exactly 
like their mothers; and not until they are a 
year old.do the young males get a coat like their 
father’s.) Some of them, indeed, do not have 
their grown-up suits for two or three years. 
Then, again, many young birds have dresses 
different from both parents. Young robins have, 
speckled breasts, and spots on the shoulders, 
which the old birds have not. 
When the father and mother are dressed alike, 
as the song sparrows are, the young birds gen- 
erally differ from both of them. When the father 
and mother are different, like orioles or blue- 
birds, the young are usually like the mother the 
first season.) In some cases the father, mother, 
and young~are almost exactly alike. J

ostrich mother, who makes her nest in plain sight 
on the sand, is dressed in grayish brown. When 
she sits on the eggs, she lays her long neck flat 
on the ground before her; then she looks like 
one of the ant-hills that are common on the 
plains of Africa, where she lives. 
The South American ostrich, or rhea, fluffs 
out her feathers and looks like a heap of dry 
grass. The male ostrich is dressed in showy 
black and white, and he stays away all day, but 
takes care of the nest at night, when his striking 
colors cannot be seen.

HOW HE CHANGES HIS CLOTHES 
Ir takes a bird weeks to put on a new suit of 
clothes. He has nothing but his feathers to 
protect him from cold and wet, and as feathers 
cannot grow out in a minute, he would be left 
naked, and suffer, if he lost them all at once. So 
he changes his dress one or two feathers at a 
time. 
Some day a feather will drop from each wing. 
If you could look, you would see that new ones. 
had started out in the same place, and pushed 
the old ones off. When the new ones are pretty 
well grown another pair will fall out. 
If all dropped out at once, besides suffering 
with cold he would not be able to fly, and he 
could not get his living, and anybody could 
catch him. But losing only one from each side 
at a time, he always has enough to fly with. 
It-is the same way with his tail feathers. He 
loses them in pairs, one from each side at the 
same time. 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  26 THE FIRST BOOK OF BIRDS 
The soft feathers that cover his body drop 
out one by one. Thus all the time he is putting 
on a new suit he still wears part of the old one. 
_ In this way he is never left without clothes for a 
moment. 
Most birds put on their new suits just after 
the young ones are grown up, and before they 
all start for the South to spend the winter, — that 
is, with many of our common birds, in August. 
At that time they are rather shy, and stop sing- 
ing. If you did not see one now and then, you 
might think they were all gone. 
Sometimes the new fall suit is not at all like 
the old one. There is the goldfinch, all summer 
in bright yellow. When he comes out in his 
new suit in August, it is dull-colored, much like 
the one his mate wears all the year, and in win- 
ter, when goldfinches fly around in little flocks, 
they look nearly all alike. 
In the spring, the male goldfinch comes out 
again in yellow. He has two suits a year,—a 
bright yellow one in the spring, and a dull olive- 
green for the winter. But his new spring dress 
is not a full suit. The yellow of the body is all 
fresh, but the black wings are the same the year 
round. 
./ Some birds have two, different colored dresses 
in a year; one they get without changing a

feather. Suppose they have feathers of black, 
with gray on the outside edges. All winter the 
gray shows and the birds seem to have gray 
coats. But in spring the gray edges wear or fall 
off, and the black shows, and then they look as 
if they had come out in new black suits. It is 
as if you should take off a gray overcoat and 
show a black coat under it. 
There is another interesting thing about birds’ 
dress. Some of them look like their mates, the 
father and mother birds so nearly alike that it is 
hard, sometimes impossible, to tell them apart. 
But when that is the case, you will notice that 
the color is not very gay. If the father wears a 
bright-colored suit, the mother does not look like 
‘him. 
For this reason the little mother is not too easily 
seen when she is on her nest. If the goldfinch 
mother were as bright as her mate, everybody 
who came near would see her on the nest, and 
some animal might take her, and leave the young 
birds to starve to death. That is probably why 
mother birds dress in such dull colors. 
hen birds live on the ground, or very near 
it, in most cases both of the pair wear the dull 
colors, so they will not easily be seen.) Wrens 
and sparrows and many others are so. But birds 
who make their nests in holes, or under ground, 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
28 THE FIRST BOOK OF BIRDS 
are often as bright as their mates, because they 
cannot be seen while sitting, and do not need to 
wear dull colors. 
A curious thing about a bird’s color is that 
the same species, or kind bird, is darker in 
one place than another. here there is much 
dampness or wet weather, the colors are darker. 
For instance, a bob-white who lives in Florida, 
or one who lives in Oregon, will be much darker 
than his cousin living in New England.)

HIS FIRST FLIGHT 
Wuew young birds are in the nest they are 
not very pretty. But when they are nearly 
feathered, and sit up on the edge, exercising 
their wings, and getting ready to fly, they are 
lovely to look at. Their feathers are more fluffy 
and fresh than those of the old birds. 
At that time they have not learned to be afraid 
of us, and if we do not frighten them by rough- 
ness, loud talking, or quick movements, we can 
often get near enough to see them well. They 
will sit up and look at us without fear. 
~ Then some day, all at once, a young bird will 
begin to flap his wings, and off he will go, flut- 
tering very hard, beating his wings, and trying 
to reach the next tree. 
Sometimes he will reach it, and perch on a 
twig, and sit quite still a long time, tired with 
his first flight. Then the parents will come and 
feed him, and after a while he will fly again. 
This time he will go farther. 
   
-P-A-G-E-48
  30 THE FIRST BOOK OF BIRDS 
So he will go on, till in a few days he can fly 
very well, and follow his parents about, and begin 
to learn where to get food. 
Sometimes when a young bird leaves the nest 
he does not reach the tree he starts for, but falls 
to the ground. Then there is trouble among 
the birds. He is in danger of being picked up 
by a cat or a boy, or of getting tangled in the 
grass or weeds. 
The poor parents are half wild with fear. They 
coax him to try again, and they follow him about 
in the grass, in great distress. I have many 
times picked up a little bird, and set him on a 
branch of a tree, or stood guard over him, driv- 
ing away cats and keeping off people, till he 
reached a place where he would be safe. 
When young birds are out, but cannot yet 
fly very well, there is much anxiety about them. 
Then, if any one comes around to disturb them, 
what can the poor little mother do? Sometimes 
she makes her young ones hide. Some of the 
birds who live on the ground will give a certain 
ery, when in a second every little one will crouch 
on the ground, or creep under a leaf, and be per- 
fectly still. And their dark colors look so like 
the earth one can hardly see them. 
Then the mother tries to make one look at 
her by queer antics. She pretends to be hurt,
-P-A-G-E-49
  HIS FIRST FLIGHT 31 
and tumbles about as if she could not fly. If it 
is a man or an animal who has frightened her, 
he will usually think he can easily catch her ; 
so he will forget about the young ones, and fol- 
low her as she goes fluttering over the ground. 
She will go on playing that she is hurt, and 
moving away, till she leads him far from her 
brood. Then she will start up and fly away, 
and he cannot find his way back to where the 
little ones are still crouching. 
Sometimes when a mother is frightened, she 
will snatch up her young one between her feet, 
and fly away with it. Sometimes a mother will 
fight, actually fly into the face of the one she 
fears. Often, too, other birds come to her aid ; 
birds of many kinds, — catbirds, robins, thrash- 
ers, and others,— all come to help her drive 
away the enemy, for birds are almost always 
ready to help each other. 
I once found a young blue jay who had come 
to the ground while trying his first flight. I 
thought I would pick him up and put him on a 
branch. But the old birds did not know what I 
meant to do, and perhaps they were afraid I 
would carry him off. 
They flew at me with loud cries to drive me 
away, and I thought it best to go, for I did not 
want to make them any more unhappy than they 
were already.
-P-A-G-E-50
  , 
32 THE FIRST BOOK OF BIRDS 
I did not go far, because I wanted to see 
that no one caught the little one. He hopped 
about in the grass a long time, while his parents 
flew around him in great distress. Many times 
he tried to fly, but he could not rise more than 
two feet from the ground. 
At last he seemed to make up his mind to 
climb a tree, for when he came to one with a 
rough bark he began to go up. He would fly 
up a few inches, then hold on with his claws to 
rest. And so, half flying and half climbing, he 
went on till he reached the lowest limb. On 
that he perched and was quiet, glad to rest after 
his hard work. The old birds were happy, too, 
and brought food to him, and so I left them.
-P-A-G-E-51

HIS EDUCATION 
Tue young bird has to be educated, or trained 
for his life, just as we do, though not exactly 
in the same way. 
He does not have to know arithmetic and 
i history; and what he needs of geography is 
only the road to the South, where he spends his 
winters. 
~— I suppose the first thing he learns is to fly. ' 
You have heard, perhaps, that the old birds 
drive their young out of the nest. But do not 
believe any such thing, for it is not true. I 
have seen many little birds leave the nest, and 
almost every one flew when the parents were 
away after food. 
The parents sometimes try to coax a nestling 
who is afraid to try his wings, like an oriole I 
knew of. All the young orioles had flown 
except this one, and he seemed to be too timid 
to try. He stood on the edge of the! nest, and 
ealled and cried, but did not use his wings.
-P-A-G-E-52
  34 THE FIRST BOOK OF BIRDS 
The father came to see him now and then, and 
at last he made him fly in this way. He caught 
a fine, large moth, and brought it to the nest in 
his beak. The young bird was very hungry, 
and when he saw the food, he opened his mouth 
and fluttered his wings, so eager to get it he 
eould hardly wait. 
But the parent did not feed him. He let him 
see the moth, and then, with a loud call, he 
flew to the next tree. When the little oriole 
saw the food going away, he forgot he was 
afraid, and with a ery of horror he sprang after 
it; and so, before he knew it, he had flown. 
After the young bird can fly, he needs to be 
taught to get his own living, or to find his own 
food, and also where to sleep. Then he must 
learn what to be afraid of, and how to protect 
himself from his enemies. 
He needs to know the different calls and cries 
of his family, and what they all mean. He has 
to learn to fly in a flock with other birds, and 
he must learn to sing. No doubt there are many 
more lessons for him that we do not know 
about. 
If you watch little birds just out of the nest, 
you may see them being taught the most useful 
and important lesson, how to find their food. 
The robin mother takes her little one to the
-P-A-G-E-53
HIS EDUCATION 35 
ground, and shows him where the worms live 
and how to get them. The owl mother finds a 
mouse creeping about in the grass, and teaches 
the owlets how to pounce upon it, by doing it 
herself before them. 
The old swallow takes her youngsters into the 
air, and shows them how to catch little flies on 
the wing; while mother pheebe teaches hers to 
sit still and watch till a fly comes near, and then 
fly out and catch it. 
If you watch long enough, after a while you 
may see the old bird, who is training a young 
one, fly away. She may leave the young one 
alone on a tree or the ground, and be gone a 
long time. 
Before many minutes the little one will get 
hungry, and begin to call for food. But by 
and by, if nobody comes to feed him, he will 
think to look around for something to eat. 
Thus he will get his lesson in helping himself. 
Once I saw a woodpecker father bring his 
little one to a fence, close by some raspberry 
bushes that were full of berries. He fed him 
two or three berries, to teach him what they 
were and where they grew, and then quietly 
slipped away. 
When the young bird began to feel hungry 
he cried out; but nobody came. Then he looked 
   
-P-A-G-E-54
36 THE FIRST BOOK OF BIRDS 
over at the raspberries, and reached out and 
tried to get hold of one. After trying three or 
four times, and nearly pitching off his perch, he 
did reach one. Then how proud he was! 
The father stayed away an hour or more, and 
before he came back that young woodpecker 
had learned to help himself very well ; though 
the minute his father came, he began to flutter 
‘his wings and beg to be fed, as if he were half 
starved. 
A lady, who fed the wild birds on her window 
sill for many years, and watched their ways, says 
she often saw the old birds teaching their little 
ones. They showed them where the food was 
to be found, and, she says, regularly taught 
them the art of eating. 
Then she saw them taught to be afraid of 
people, not to come too near her. “And once she 
saw an old bird showing a young one how to 
gather twigs for nest-building. The young one 
looked on a while, and then tried hard to do it 
himself, but could not get off a single twig. 
Best of all, the same lady heard an old robin 
giving a music lesson. The teacher would sing 
a few notes and then stop, while the pupil tried 
to copy them. He had a weak, babyish sort of 
voice, and did not succeed very well at first. 
T have heard several birds at their music les 
sons.
-P-A-G-E-55
x 
SOME OF HIS LESSONS 
Ir is very easy to catch the birds teaching 
their little ones to exercise their wings and to 
fly together. You will see the young birds 
sitting quietly on fences or trees, when all at 
once the parents begin to fly around, with 
strange loud calls. In a minute every young- 
ster will fly out and join them. Around and 
around they all go, hard. as they can, till their 
little wings are tired, and then they come down 
and alight again. 
Once I saw a young bird who did not go 
when his parents called. All the others flew 
around many times, and I suppose that young 
one thought he would not be noticed. 
But mothers’ eyes are sharp, and his mother 
saw him. So when she came back, she flew 
right at her naughty son, and knocked him off 
his perch. The next time she called, he flew 
with the rest. This was a crow mother. 
I have seen a bluebird just out of the nest,
-P-A-G-E-56
  38 THE FIRST BOOK OF BIRDS 
taught to follow his father in this way. He 
stood on a small.tree, erying for something to 
eat, when his father came in sight with a beak- 
ful of food. He did not feed. him, but flew 
past him, so close that he almost touched him, 
and alighted on the next tree, a little beyond 
him. 
The little bluebird saw the food, and at once 
flew after it, perched beside his father, and was 
fed. Then the old bird left him, and in a few 
minutes he felt hungry, and began to call 
again. 
I kept close watch, and soon the father came 
and did the same thing over. He flew past the 
young one with an insect in plain sight in his 
beak, and perched on another tree still farther 
along in the way he wanted the little one to go. 
The hungry baby followed, and was fed as 
before. In this way he was led to a big tree 
the other side of the yard, where the rest of 
the family were, and where they all spent the 
night. 
An old robin wanted to teach her young one 
to bathe. She brought him to a dish of water 
kept for their use by some people who were 
fond of birds. The little one stood on the edge 
and watched his mother go in, and splash and 
scatter the water. He fluttered his wings, and

-P-A-G-E-58

-P-A-G-E-59
  SOME OF HIS LESSONS 39 
was eager to try it for himself, but seemed afraid 
to plunge in. 
At last the mother flew away and left him 
standing there, and in a moment came back 
with a worm in her mouth. The young robin 
was hungry, as young birds always are, and 
when he saw the worm, he began to flutter his 
wings, and ery for it. 
But the mother jumped into the middle of 
the water dish, and stood there, holding the 
worm in his sight. The youngster wanted the 
worm so much that he seemed to forget his fear 
of the water, and hopped right in beside her. 
She fed him, and then began to splash about, 
and he liked it so well that he stayed and took 
a. good bath. 
\ Birds, as these stories show, teach their little 
ones by coaxing, and not by driving them.) 
An Englishman, Mr. Lloyd Morgan, once 
had some ducks and chickens hatched away from 
their mother, to see how much their parents had 
to teach them. 
He found that these little orphans had to be 
taught to pick up their food, and to know what 
is good to eat. . He had to show the young 
ducks how to dive, and teach all of them that 
water is good to drink. 
To see if chickens had to be taught the hen
-P-A-G-E-60
  40 THE FIRST BOOK OF BIRDS 
language, he put them out by their mother 
when they were a few days old. 
The hen was going about with her brood, all 
brothers and sisters of Mr. Morgan’s chicks, 
and she was quite ready to adopt the new ones. 
She clucked and called to them with all her 
might, but they did not come. They acted as 
if they did not hear her. When the others ran 
and crept under her wings to be brooded, the 
strangers looked on, but did not think of going 
too. 
They did not understand the calls or the 
ways of their own mother. They had not been 
taught. 
A careful watcher will see the birds teach 
these things, and many others as interesting. 
But no one will see anything unless he is quiet, 
and does not frighten them.

THE BIRD'S LANGUAGE 
Wuen the bird is grown up, there are many 
other interesting things to know about him, — 
one is, whether he can talk. 
It is plain to those who have studied the ways 
~ of birds, that they are able to tell things to each 
other, and many writers have said plainly that 
birds have a language. 
If you notice birds in cages, you will find that 
when two or more of a kind are in the same 
room, you will hear little chirps and twitters 
and other notes, not at all like their song. But 
if one is alone in a room, he hardly makes a 
sound except when singing. 
Then see a robin out of doors. He is less 
afraid of us than most birds, and easiest to 
watch. If something comes up on him sud- 
denly, he gives a sharp note of surprie. If a 
cat appears, he has another ery which every one 
can understand, a word of warning to all. If 
everything is quiet and his mate is near, he will 
greet her with some low, sweet notes. 
   
-P-A-G-E-64
  44 THE ‘BIRD GROWN UP 
When a partridge mother sees danger, she 
gives one call, which all her brood know, and at 
once run and hide. When the hen speaks to 
her chicks, they know well whether it means to 
~ come to her, or to run away. 
Of course birds do not use our words. When 
it is said that the quail says “Bob White,” it is 
meant that his call sounds like those words. 
To some the notes sound like “more wet.” One 
may call it almost anything, like “all right” or 
“too hot.” 
You will read in books about birds, that a 
certain warbler says ‘“ Witches here,” or that 
the white-throated sparrow says “ Old Sam Pea- 
body,” and other birds say still different things. 
The writer means that the words remind one of 
the bird’s notes, and so it is useful to know 
them, because it helps you to know the bird 
when you hear him. 
Ihave many times seen birds act as if they 
were talking to each other. You can often see 
the city sparrows do so. 
There is nothing in a bird’s ways that we like 
so well as his singing. And in all the many 
species cf birds in the world, no two sing exactly 
alike, so far as I can find out. You may always 
know a bird by his song. A robin does not 
sing like a thrush or a catbird. And what is
-P-A-G-E-65
    THE BIRD’S LANGUAGE 45 
more, not one of the sounds he utters is like 
those made by any other bird. If you know 
him well, whatever noise he makes, you will 
know at once that it is a robin. 
But there is something still more curious 
about it. No robin sings exactly like another 
robin. When you come to know one bird well, 
you can tell his song from any other bird’s. Of 
course, all robins sing enough alike for one to 
know that it is a robin song, but if you listen 
closely, you will see that it is really different 
from all others. 
Persons who have kept birds in cages have 
noticed the same thing. 
There is still another point to know. One 
bird does not always sing the same song. I 
have heard:a song sparrow sing five or six differ- 
ent songs, standing all the time in plain sight on 
a fence. In the same way I have known a mea- 
dowlark to make six changes in his few notes. 
Besides their own natural songs, many birds . 
like to copy the notes of others. Our mocking- ‘ 
bird is very fond of learning new things, and he 
does not always choose songs either. 
He will imitate the noise of filing a saw, or the 
pop of a cork, as readily as the sweetest song. 
I have heard one sing the canary’s song better 
than the canary himself.
-P-A-G-E-66
  46 THE BIRD GROWN UP 
Other birds can do the same. A common 
English sparrow picked up in the streets of a 
big city, hurt, and not able to fly, was put into 
a room with a canary. 
No doubt the wild bird found his life in a 
cage rather dull, after having been used to the 
streets, and he soon began to amuse himself try- 
ing to do as the canary did, to sing. In a few 
weeks he learned the whole song, and he could 
sing it even better than his roommate, for his 
voice was full and rich, and not so shrill as the 
canary’s. 
. Most people think that birds sing all summer. 
They think so because they have not taken 
notice. We who are very fond of bird song 
know it is not so. 
Singing begins when the birds first come in 
/ the spring. It goes on while the nest is beng 
built, and the mother bird is sitting. The 
father has little to do at that time, and so he’ 
sings. And besides, he seems to be so happy 
that he cannot help it. 
But when little ones begin to call for food, 
he has to be very busy, and does not have so 
much time for music. Some birds. stop singing 
as soon as they go to feeding. 
But not all do so. Many go on singing till * 
they begin to change their clothes, or to moult, 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
THE BIRD’S LANGUAGE 47 
as it is called. | This happens in August or 
September, and when it begins, a bird seems to 
lose his voice. 
One of the first to stop singing is the bobo- 
link. He is rarely heard after June is past. 
The veery is another whose singing days are 
over early. You may hear his call in the woods, 
if you know it, but not a song will you hear 
after the middle of July. 
By the time August comes in, almost every 
bird is silent, except for his calls or “talk.” 
The birds to be heard then are the red-eyed 
vireo, who seems never to tire, and now and 
then the indigo-bird, or the wood pewee, and 
best of all, the dear little song sparrow, who 
keeps up his cheery songs till the very last. 
Then you will know that all the birds are 
busy putting on their new suits for their long 
- journey.

WHAT HE EATS 
Wuar the bird eats and where he gets his 
food are useful things for us to know. It has 
only lately been found out that birds are the 
most valuable of helpers to us. 
What we cannot eat ourselves, they are happy 
to live on, and things that make us a great deal 
of trouble are their daily food. 
Some of the things they are fond of are 
little animals, like mice and ground squirrels, 
that eat our crops. Others are insects which 
spoil our fruit and eat up our vegetables, canker- 
worms and cutworms, and a hundred more. 
Besides these, many birds eat the seeds of cer- 
tain weeds that farmers have to fight all the 
time. 
One reason this helps us so greatly is that 
birds eat much more for their size than we do. 
(A boy of six or eight years could not possibly™ 
eat a whole sheep in one day, but a young bird / 
can easily eat more than his own weight every/. 
\ day. 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
  WHAT HE EATS 4g 
They want more than three meals too. They 
need to eat very often. One catbird will take 
thirty grasshoppers for his breakfast, and in a 
few hours he will want thirty more. So he de- 
stroys a great many in a day. 
Birds begin eating Jong before we are out of 
bed, and keep it up till night comes again, or as 
long as they can see. 
You must not think the birds are greedy, as 
a person would be if he ate every few minutes 
all day. They are made to do so. It is their 
business to destroy insects, small animals, and 
weeds that trouble us so much, and the more 
they eat the better for us. 
Let us see where they go for food. Each 
bird has his own place to work. 
The catbird watches the fruit-trees, and all 
day long eats insects that are spoiling our fruit 7 
or killing the trees, When the cherries are 
ripe, we should not forget that he has saved the 
fruit from insects, and has well earned a share 
for himself. 2 
If you spent days and weeks picking off in- 
sects, would you not think you had earned part 
of the fruit? “For every cherry he eats” (says 
a man who has watched him), “he has eaten at 
teast one thousand insects.” 
The robin eats great numbers of canker 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  50 THE BIRD GROWN UP 
, “worms, which destroy our apples, and cutworms, 
~ which kill the corn. 
The bluebird sits on the fence keeping sharp 
watch, and every few minutes flies down and 
picks up a grasshopper or a cricket, or some 
such grass-eating insect. 
( Woodpeckers hunt over the trunks and limbs 
of trees. They tap on the bark and listen, and 
if they hear a grub stir inside, they cut a hole 
in the bark and drag it out. The downy is 
fond of insects that infest our apple-trees, and 
he makes many holes in the trunks, But it 
does not hurt the trees. It is good for them, 
for it takes away the creatures that were eating 
them. 
Orioles go over the fruit-trees, and pick out 
‘tiny insects under the leaves, and when they 
find great nests on the branches, they tear them 
open and kill the caterpillars that made them. 
Little warblers, such as the pretty summer 
yellow-bird, help to keep our trees clear, doing 
most of their work in the tops, where we can 
hardly see them. 
Swallows fly about in the air, catching mos- 
~ quitoes and tiny flies that trouble ust

States, soaring about high in the air, looking 
for their food. 
What they eat is so very unpleasant to us 
that we are apt to despise the birds. But we 
should cherish /and feel grateful to them in- 
stead. For they are doing us the greatest kind- 
ness. In many of the hot countries people 
could not live, if these most useful birds were 
killed. | 
Some persons think buzzards find their food 
by seeing itj and others are just as sure that 
they smell it.. Perhaps they use both senses.

MORE ABOUT HIS FOOD 
Some of the big birds work all the time for 
us. When you see a hawk sitting very still on 
a dead limb, what do you suppose he is doing ? 
A good deal of the time he is looking on the 
ground for a mouse, or a ground squirrel, or a 
rat, or some creature that he likes to eat. 
When he sees one of them move in the grass, 
he flies down and pounces upon it. Thus he 
helps the farmer greatly, for all of these little 
animals destroy crops. 
When it grows dark, hawks stop work and go 
to sleep. Then the owls, who can see better in 
the dusk, come out of the holes where they have 
been half sleeping all day. They hunt the same 
little creatures, most of all rats and mice, which 
like best to run about in the night. 
Perhaps you have heard that hawks and owls 
carry off chickens. Many people who keep 
chickens shoot every hawk and owl they see. 
But if they knew more about them they would
-P-A-G-E-73

not do so. nly two of the common hawks 
and one owl’ disturb ctinkay All the others 
kill thousands of the little anitnals that give the 
farmers so much trouble. 
Owls have a curious way of eating mice. 
They swallow them whole, and after a while 
they throw up a queer-looking little ball made 
of the bones and fur of the mouse. 
You may some time have seen a long~ legged 
heron walking about on the seashore or in the 
salt marsh. Now and then he would thrust his 
long, sharp bill into something, and lift up his 
head and swallow. Or you have noticed a 
little sandpiper running along on the beach or 
the bank of a river. 
The heron was probably eatiag frogs or fish, 
and the sandpiper some of the small sea crea- 
tures thrown up by the waves. If these were 
not taken away they would be very bad for us, 
and perhaps make us sick. 
Not less useful to us than these birds are the 
whole family of finches. he goldfinch in 
bright yellow coat, the purplé-finch in red, and 
the sparrows in plain brown. All of these are 
fond of seeds ‘as-well-as insects, and most of all 
they like the\ seeds of some weeds-that are hard 
to get rid of!

The goldfinch is called the thistle-bird, be: 
cause he likes best the seeds of thistles, though 
he eats the beggar’s-ticks-too. 
The chipping sparrow, the little red-headed 
bird who comes about our doors, eats the seeds 
of fox-tail and crab grasses, that spoil our lawns. 
The white-throated sparrow, a large and-very~ 
pretty bird, eats the seeds of smartweed and 
ragweed. Other finches like bittersweet, sorrel, 
and amaranth, all of which we are glad to have 
them eat. 
The seed-eating birds can find their food in 
winter, even when snow covers the ground, be- 
cause the dead weeds hold on to their seeds, and 
the snow is not often deep enough to cover 
them. 
Some birds gather their food in the fall, and 
hide it away where they can find it in winter. 
Blue jays collect acorns and beech-nuts, and 
store them in a hole in a tree, or some other 
safe place, to eat when food is scarce. A wood- 
pecker who lives in the West picks holes in the 
bark of a tree, and puts an acorn into each one. 
The oddest store I know of was made by a 
woodpecker. He found a long crack in a post, 
and stuffed it full of live grasshoppers. He did 
not like dead grasshoppers. He wedged them 
into the crack so tightly that they could not get
-P-A-G-E-75
  MORE ABOUT HIS FOOD 55 
out, and I do not know that they wanted to. 
When grasshoppers were scarce in the fields, he 
came day after day to his queer: storehouse, till 
he had eaten every one. 
One of the woodpecker family who lives in 
Mexico stores nuts and acorns in the stems of 
plants. These stems are hollow and made in 
joints like bamboo. The bird cuts a hole at the 
upper end of a joint, and stuffs it full. When 
he wants his nuts, he cuts a hole at the lower 
end of the joint and pulls them out. 
I once had a tame blue jay, who was fond of 
saving what he could not eat, and putting it 
safely away. The place he seemed to think 
most secure was somewhere about me, and he 
would come slyly around me as I sat at work, 
and try to hide his treasure about my clothes. 
When it was a dried currant or bit of bread, 
I did not care; but when he came on to my 
shoulder, and tried to tuck a dead meal worm 
into my hair or between my lips, or a piece of 
raw beef under a ruffle or in my ear, I had to 
decline to be used as a storehouse, much to his 
grief. 
He liked to put away other things as well as 
food. Matches he seemed to think were made 
for him to hide. His chosen place for them was 
between the breadths of matting on the floor. 
   
-P-A-G-E-76
56 THE BIRD GROWN UP 
Once he found a parlor match, hunted up a 
good opening, and put it in. Then he went on, 
as he always did, to hammer it down so tightly 
that it would stay. One of the blows of his 
hard beak struck the lighting end of the match, 
and it went off with a sharp crack. The noise 
and the flame which burst out made the bird 
jump three feet, and scared him nearly out of 
his senses. 
After that I took care to keep the matches 
out of the way of a bird so fond of hiding 
things.

WHERE HE SLEEPS 
Most birds sleep on their feet. 
You know how a canary goes to sleep, all 
puffed out like a ball, with his head buried in 
the feathers of his shoulder. He may stick his 
bill over behind the top of the wing, but he 
never “puts his head under his wing,” as you 
have heard. 
Sometimes he stands straight up on one leg, 
with the other drawn up out of sight in his fea- 
thers, but more often he sits down on the perch, 
still resting on his feet. Most wild birds of the 
perching kind sleep in the same way. 
It is only lately that we have begun to find 
out where birds sleep, because it is dark when 
they go to bed, and they get up before it is 
light enough for us to see them. 
The only way to catch them in bed is to go 
out in the evening, and start them up after they 
have gone to sleep. And this is not very kind 
to the poor little birds. Some men who are try: 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
i 
  58 THE BIRD GROWN UP 
ing to learn about the habits of birds have tried 
this way, and so have found out some of their 
sleeping-places. 
One thing they have learned is that the nest 
is not often used for a bed, except for the 
mother, while she is sitting and keeping her 
little ones warm. 
Robins and orioles, and others, creep into the 
‘thick branches of an evergreen tree, close up to 
the trunk. Some crawl under the edge of a 
haystack, others into thick vines or thorny 
bushes. All these are meant for hiding-places, 
so that beasts which prowl about at night, and 
like to eat birds, will not find them. 
Tree sparrows like to sleep in holes in the 
ground like little caves. The men who found 
these cosy little bedrooms think they are places 
dug out by field mice, and other small animals, 
for their own use. And when they are left, the 
birds are glad to take them. 
When the weather is cold, some birds sleep 
under the snow. You may think that would 
not be very warm, and it is not so warm as a 
bed in the house with plenty of blankets. But 
it is much warmer than a perch in a tree, with 
nothing but leaves to keep off the wind. 
While the snow is falling, some birds find it 
as good as blankets for their use. Grouse, who  
-P-A-G-E-79
  
WHERE HE SLEEPS 59 
live on the ground, dive into a snow-bank, and 
snuggle down quietly, while the snow falls and 
covers them all over, and keeps the cold wind off. 
Air comes through the snow, so they do not 
smother. 
Some birds creep into a pile of brush that is 
covered with snow, and find under the twigs 
little places like tents, where the snow has been 
kept out by the twigs, and they sleep there, 
away from the wind and sterm outside. 
Water birds find the best sleeping-places on 
the water, where they float all night like tiny 
boats. Some of them leave one foot hanging 
down and paddling a little, while they sleep, to 
keep from being washed to the shore. 
Bob-white and his family sleep in a close 
circle on the ground, all with their heads turned 
outward) so that they can see or hear an enemy, 
whichever way he comes. 
Hawks and eagles are said to sleep standing, 
never sitting on the feet like a canary. Some 
ducks and geese do even more: they sleep stand- 
ing on one foot. Woodpeckers and chimney 
swifts hang themselves up by their claws, using 
their stiff tail for a brace, as if it were a third 
leg. 
Some birds, like the crows, sleep in great 
flocks. They agree upon a piece of woods, and
-P-A-G-E-80
  60 THE BIRD GROWN UP 
all the crows for miles around come there every 
night. Sometimes thousands sleep in this one 
bedroom, called a crow roost. Robins do the 
same, after the young are big enough to fly so 
far. 
Audubon, who has told us so much about 
birds, once found a hollow tree which was the 
sleeping-room of chimney swifts. The noise 
they made going out in the morning was like the 
roar of a great mill-wheel. 
He wanted to see the birds asleep. -So in the 
daytime, when they were away, he had a piece 
cut out at the foot of the tree, big enough to let 
him in, and then put back, so the birds would 
not notice anything unusual. 
At night, after the swifts were abed, he took 
a dark lantern and went in. He turned the 
light upon them little by little, so as not to startle 
them. Then he saw the whole inside of the 
tree full of birds. They were hanging by their 
claws, side by side, as thick as they could hang. 
He thought there were as many as twelve thou: 
sand in that one bedroom.

HIS TRAVELS 
Mosr of our birds take two long journeys“ 
every year, one in the fall to the south, and the 
other in the spring back to the north. These 
journeys are called “ migrations.” 
The birds do not go all at once, but in many 
cases those of a kind who live near each other 
collect in a flock and travel together. Each 
species or kind has its own time to go. 
It might be thought that it is because of the 
cold that so many birds move to a warmer cli- 
mate. But it is not so; they are very well 
dressed to endure cold. Their feather suits are 
so warm that some of our smallest and weakest 
birds are able to stay with us, like the chickadee 
and the golden-crowned kinglet. It is simply 
because they cannot get food in winter, that they 
have to go. 
The fall travel begins soon after the first of 
July. The bobolink is one of the first to leave 
us, though he does not start at once on his long 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  62 THE BIRD GROWN UP 
journey. By that time his little folk are full 
grown, and can take care of themselves, and he 
is getting on his winter suit, or moulting. 
Then some morning all the bobolinks in the 
country are turned out of their homes in the 
meadows, by men’ and horses and mowing-ma- 
chines, for at that time the long grass is ready 
to cut. 
Then he begins to think about the wild rice 
which is getting just right to eat. Besides, he 
likes to take his long journey to South America 
in an easy way, stopping here and there as he 
goes. So some morning we miss his cheerful 
call, and if we go to the meadow we shall not be 
able to see a single bobolink. 
There, too, are the swallows, who eat only 
small flying insects. As the weather grows 
cooler, these tiny flies are no longer to be found. 
So the swallows begin to flock, as it is called. 
For a few days they will be seen on fences and 
telegraph. wires, chattering and making a great 
noise, and then some morning they will all be 
gone. 
They spend some time in marshes, and other 
lonely places, before they at last set out for the 
south. 
As the days grow shorter and cooler, the war- 
blers go. These are the bright-colored little

fellows, who live mostly in the tops of trees. 
Then the orioles and the thrushes and the cuckoos 
leave us, and most birds who live on insects. 
By the time that November comes in, few of 
them will be left. Birds who can live on seeds 
and winter berries, such as cedar-berries and 
partridge-berries, and others, often stay with us, 
— bluebirds, finches, and sometimes robins. 
Many birds take their journey by night. 
Think of it! Tiny.creatures, that all summer 
go to bed at dark, start off some night, when it 
seems as if they ought to be sti and fly all 
night in the dark. 
When it grows light, they stop in some place 
where they ean feed and rest. And the next 
night, or two or three nights later, they go on 
again. So they do till they reach their winter 
home, hundreds or thousands of miles away. 
These night flyers are the timid birds, and 
those who live in the woods, and do not like to 
be seen, — thrushes, wrens, vireos, and others. 
Birds with strong wings, who are used to fly- 
ing hours every day, and bolder birds, who do 
not mind being seen, take their journey by day- 
light. 
Most of them stop now and then, a day or 
two ata time, to feed and rest. They fly very 
high, and faster than our railroad trains can go. 
ee
-P-A-G-E-86
  64 THE BIRD GROWN UP 
In the spring the birds take their second long 
journey, back to their last year’s home. 
How they know their way on these journeys, 
men have been for many years trying to find out. 
_/ They have found that birds travel on regular 
roads, or routes, that follow the rivers and the 
shore of the ocean. They can see much better 
than we can, and even in the night they can see 
water. 
One such road, or highway, is over the har- 
bor of New York. When the statue of Liberty 
was set up on an island in the harbor a few 
years ago, it was put in the birds’ path. 
Usually they fly too high to mind it ; but when 
there is a rain or fog they come much lower, 
and, sad to say, many of them fly against it and 
are killed. 
We often see strange birds in our city streets 
and parks, while they are passing through on 
their migrations, for they sometimes spend sev- 
eral days with us. 
A sparrow, who was hurt and unable to fly, 
was picked up one fall and kept in a house all 
winter. He was not caged, and he chose for 
his headquarters and sleeping-place a vase that 
stood on a shelf. 
He went with the family to the table, and 
made himself very much at home there. He ’  
-P-A-G-E-87
  HIS TRAVELS 65 
picked out what he wanted to eat and drink, and 
scolded well if he did not have it. 
The thing he liked best was butter, and when 
he was ready to wipe his bill after eating, as 
birds do, he found the coat-sleeve of the master 
soft and nice for the purpose. This pleased the 
bird better than it did the owner of the sleeve, 
but he tried in vain to keep the saucy fellow 
off. If he forgot for an instant to watch the 
bird, he would dash up, wipe off the butter, and 
fly away out of the reach of everybody. 
In the spring the sparrow left the family, and 
lived out of doors. But, with the first cold 
weather of fall, he came back, went to his old 
vase, and settled himself for the winter again. 
This he did for several years.
-P-A-G-E-88

HIS WINTER HOME 
NeEarty every bird has two homes, one for 
winter and one for summer. 
We can see why birds leave us and go to a 
warmer and better place for the winter ; but why 
they do not stay in that country where there is 
always plenty of food, but choose to come back 
in the spring to their old home, we do not 
know. 
It may be because they want more room to 
build nests, and bring up their little ones. Or 
it may be that they want to come back because 
they love their old home. 
Whatever may be the reason, it is well for us 
that they do so, for if we had no more birds in 
the summer than we have in the winter, we 
should suffer very much from insects. We 
could not raise fruit, or vegetables, or grain, for 
insects would eat it all, That is one reason we 
are so glad that birds come back to us in the 
spring. 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
HIS WINTER HOME 67 
Though so many birds leave us in the fall, 
they do not all go. A few come to us who have 
nested farther north, and some who have been 
with us all summer stay over winter too. These 
last are called “ permanent residents,” that is, 
they stay all the year round. 
In the Middle States of the East — New York, 
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Ohio — there are 
twenty or twenty-five who stay all the year. 
There are several hawks and owls and wood- 
peckers, the crow, bob-white, the blue jay, and 
the meadowlark, and, of the little ones, the gold- 
finch, in his sober winter coat, his cousin the 
purple finch, the song sparrow, the nuthatch, 
and the chickadee. 
Besides these “permanent residents,” there 
are ten or twelve who come from the north. 
The funny little saw-whet owl is one, and the 
snowflake, who loves to frolic in the snow, is 
another. 
Many of our summer birds stay in the South- 
ern States all winter. Those who can eat seeds 
and winter berries—for instance, robins and 
bluebirds, catbirds and sparrows — need not go 
very far south; and some of them even stay 
in the State of New York. 
Most of our birds who do not eat berries, but 
must have insects, go farther, some to Florida 
a 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  68 THE BIRD GROWN UP 
or the West Indies, others to Central America, 
and a few even into South America, — except 
the woodpecker, who gets his insects under the 
bark of trees. 
The summer birds of the Western States nearly 
all go to Mexico for the winter. 
The little birds who stay with us are only 
those who can eat seeds, as I said, or the eggs 
and insects to be found in the crevices of the 
bark on trees. These birds do a great deal of 
good, for each one destroys thousands of insects 
before they have come out of the egg. One 
small chickadee will eat several hundred insect 
eggs in a day. 
These little fellows can almost always find 
their food, for the snow seldom covers the trunks 
of the trees; but new and then in the winter 
we have an ice storm; then the trunks and 
branches are buried under ice, so that the birds 
suffer, and perhaps will starve to death. 
In such a time it will be kind of you who 
live in the country to put out food for them. 
‘You can give them any table scraps of meat or 
vegetables, or bread, chopped fine for their tiny 
mouths, with corn or grain for bigger birds. 
What they all like best to eat is suet, — which 
the butcher will give you, — chopped fine, or, 
better still, nailed or tied to a branch or a fence,
-P-A-G-E-91
HIS WINTER HOME @ 
so that they can pick off morsels for them- 
selves. This. will make them all very happy ; 
but you must see that the English sparrow does 
not drive them away, or eat it all himself. 
Some persons who live in the country or 
small towns spread a table every day through 
the winter for the birds. Many come for food, 
and they have great pleasure in watching them 
and studying their ways. 
One lady I know who is an invalid, and her 
greatest happiness in the long cold months, when 
she cannot go out, is to set her breakfast- ‘table, 
and watch the guests who come to it. 
She lives in the southern part of Ohio, and 
she- has all winter cardinal grosbeaks, or red- 
birds as she calls them, blue jays, tufted titmice, 
and others. The cardinals are fine singers, and 
they sing to her every month in the year. 
 
-P-A-G-E-92

HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS 
Many people think that as soon as the young 
birds of a nest are full grown, and know how to 
take care of themselves, the family separate, and 
have no more to do with each other. Some have 
even said that the old birds push the little ones 
out of the nest to get rid of them. 
All this is a great mistake, and any one who 
has watched them carefully will say so. 
In many cases, when the brood is grown and 
all have left the nest, the whole family keep to- 
j/gether. One who has eyes sharp to see will find 
everywhere little groups of parents with their 
young. If the old birds rear more than one 
brood in a summer, the young ones of the first 
nest keep together. 
T have often seen little parties of young blue- 
birds or sparrows going about after food on the 
grass, or on the newly cut hay. Now and then 
one of the parents would come around as if to 
see that all was well, and then leave them alone  
-P-A-G-E-93
  HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS 71 
again. When the second brood is ready to go 
out, the whole family often unite in a small flock. 
In some cases, where they could be watched, they 
have been known to stay so all winter. All 
through July and August, in the New England 
and Middle States, one may see these pretty little 
family groups. 
Some birds who live and nest by themselves, 
each pair in its own tree, or bush, or field, come 
together in larger parties after the young are 
grown, in a social way. A few do this only at 
night, in what are called roosts, which I spoke 
of in a former chapter. 
Other birds, when nestlings are out, unite in 
flocks, and stay so all the time, or through the 
winter. Our pretty little goldfinch does this. 
Most of the birds we see about our homes like 
to have a tree or bush to themselves for their 
nest. But there are many birds that live close 
together all the time. Some, you may say, in 
small villages, — swallows, for instance. We 
generally see several swallows flying about to- 
gether. They make their nests near each other. 
The barn swallow chooses the beams inside the 
barn, and there are often three or four or more 
nests in the same barn. 
The eave swallows put their mud cottages in 
@ row, under the eaves outside the barn. One 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  72 THE BIRD GROWN UP 
would think they needed to have numbers on 
their doors, to know which was their own. 
There, too, are the common crow blackbirds. 
They come in the spring in crowds, and when it 
vis time to make nests, they find some grove or 
clump of trees that suits them, and all of them 
build their nests close together. Often there are 
two or three on one tree, like-a bird city. There 
they live and rear their little ones, and it is said 
they never quarrel. 
Then there are the birds who get their food 
from the sea, such as penguins. These birds live 
in big cities, of many thousand nests. They go 
to an island where no people live, and build on 
the ground, or on rocks, or anywhere. 
Sometimes they are so near together one can 
hardly walk without stepping on them. How 
each mother can tell her own, it is hard to see. 
They live very happily together, and if a mother 
is killed, so that her little ones are left orphans, 
one of the neighbors will adopt them all, and 
feed and bring them up with her own. 
Some of these birds do not even take the 
trouble to make a nest. They put the eggs any- 
where on the sand or earth, 
Some one, Mr. Brehm, I think, tells a pretty 
story about a certain kind of duck who rears two 
broods every season. After the ducklings of the
-P-A-G-E-95
  HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS oT 
first brood have learned to take care of them- 
selves, they go about together, getting their food 
and sailing on the water in a little party, while 
their parents are hatching the second brood. 
But when the younger ones are big enough, 
they are led to the water, and at once their elder 
brothers and sisters join them. They all swim 
around together, the youngest in the middle of 
the group, where they are protected and fed by 
the elder brood as well as by the parents, a lovely 
and united little family.

Brrps are helpful to each other when in 
trouble. If a robin is in distress, other robins 
will come to see what is the matter, and to help 
if they can. And not only robins, but catbirds, 
and orioles, and chickadees, and others, will 
come, too. 
Sometimes when a person tries to rob a nest, 
all the birds near will come in a crowd, to drive 
away the thief. They will cry and scream at 
him, and sometimes fly at his face, and try to 
peck his eyes. § 
Birds are so little they cannot fight a man, 
but if they can peck at his face, they can hurt 
him, and if they really get at his eyes, they can 
put them out. We cannot blame the birds for 
trying to protect themselves and their young, 
and it is well for boys to be careful how they 
disturb a nest. 
One proof that birds really do help each 
other is the fact that when a man wants to know
-P-A-G-E-97
  HIS KINDNESS TO OTHERS - 75 
what birds live in a place, he can bring them all 
around him by making a sound like a young 
bird in distress. AJl who hear it will come to 
see what is the matter. 
Let me tell you a story of some young swal- 
lows. They were able to fly a little, and were 
sitting together on a roof, when a lady who 
was watching them noticed that one of them 
seemed to be weak, and not able to stand up. 
When the parents came with food, the others 
stood up and opened their mouths, and so were 
fed, but this little one hardly ever got a morsel. 
If birds had no love for each other, as many 
people think, these strong little ones would not 
have cared if their brother did starve; but what 
did the lady see? She says that two of the 
strong young swallows came close up to their 
weak brother, one on each side. They put their 
beaks under his breast and lifted him up on to 
his legs, and then crowded so close against him 
that their little bodies propped him up, and held 
him there; so that he had his chance of being 
fed as well as they. 
Many times birds have been seen who were 
blind or old, or who had a wing or a leg broken, 
or were in some way hurt so that they could not 
take care of themselves, and who were being 
waited upon by other birds, fed, and led to the 
water to drink and bathe.
-P-A-G-E-98
  16 THE BIRD GROWN UP 
Birds have been found caught in the lining of 
a nest, so that they were held there and could 
not go for food. They had been there for 
weeks, and would have starved to death if they 
had not been fed. Yet they were so well taken 
care of by other birds that they were strong and 
able to fly. 
In one case, where the nest was in a tree trunk, 
the hole in the trunk had grown up, so that 
when big enough to fly, they could not get out, 
and they had been there for months. Yet when 
a man cut open the trunk and let them out, they 
were well and lively, proving that they had. been 
fed by friends outside all that time. 
I could tell you many true stories of the kind 
care of birds for each other, and for baby birds 
who had lost their parents, or been stolen away 
from them. , 
A gentleman in Massachusetts told me that 
when he was a boy he saw a small flock of che- 
winks who came about a house where food was 
put out for birds. They came every day, and he 
soon saw that one was bigger than the rest, and 
that he never tried to pick up anything for him- 
self, but all the others fed him. 
One day he was cruel enough to throw a stone 
at the bird who was so well taken care of, and 
when he took up his victim, he found that the  
-P-A-G-E-99
  HIS KINDNESS TO OTHERS 7 
upper and lower parts of his bill were crossed, 
so that he could not pick up anything from the 
ground, where chewinks find their food. He 
had been born thus deformed, and if he had not 
been fed every day by his friends he must have 
starved to death. Yet so well had he been cared 
for that he was better grown than any of the 
others.

HIS AFFECTIONS 
I am sure I need not say that father and 
mother birds love their little ones. 
So much does the mother love her nestlings 
that she is often willing to die for them. Orioles 
and chickadees will let themselves be caught in 
the hand of one who has taken their young, 
rather than desert them. 
Some birds live in our chimneys, generally in 
a flue that is not in use, and are called chimney 
swifts. If a chimney takes fire the mother swift 
tries hard to get her little ones out, but if they 
cannot fly, she has been seen to fly into the fire 
herself, and die with them. 
Robins have been found frozen to death on 
their nest. They could easily have saved them- 
selves, but they would not leave their young ones 
to perish. A ground bird has been known to sit 
on her nest during a freezing storm, till she died, 
rather than go and leave her little ones to suffer. 
Once when a young cedar-bird was caught 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  
HIS AFFECTIONS 79 
and carried off, the father followed it for miles, 
crying and showing so much distress that the 
man who had stolen it was sorry for him, and 
let the little one go. 
Every one who: has watched them knows that 
birds love their mates. A man once shot a sea 
bird, when her mate came about him, crying 
and showing his grief as well as if he could 
speak. 
I could easily fill a book with stories to prove 
that birds are loving to their mates and young, 
and all of them true. 
It does not seem strange that birds are fond 
of their own, but they love others also. And 
not only other birds, but even animals like cats, 
dogs, and horses sometimes. 
I once had an English goldfinch in the house. 
He was a little fellow, not so big as a canary, 
and he was very fond of another bird in the 
room. ‘This was a scarlet tanager, who- was 
much larger than himself. 
The small bird showed his love for his red 
friend, just as people show love, by staying 
close to him, singing to him, and driving away 
any bird who came too near. 
A lady once told me this story showing the 
love of a pigeon for a cat. The cat was fond 
of lying on the broad window sill. When the
-P-A-G-E-102
  80 THE BIRD GROWN UP 
pigeon saw her there, he would fly down, and 
alight beside her. Then he would press up 
close to her, and rub against her fur, as if glad 
to see her, and the cat seemed to enjoy it as 
much as the bird. 
; Often a bird who is tamed loves his human 
' friends. A man had a crow who was very fond 
of him. He had reared the bird from the nest 
and never shut him up, but let him fly about 
wherever he chose. 
One day he was out in a sudden rain, and his 
feathers got wet, so that he could not fly well. 
Then a boy caught him, and carried him seven 
miles away. He clipped one wing, so that the 
erow could not fly, and kept him shut in the 
house all winter. In the spring, the first time he 
could get out, the bird started for his old home. 
He could not fly, but he walked the seven 
miles, through mud and wet, and came home so 
tired that he was almost dead. When his mas: 
ter saw him coming he went to meet him, took 
him up and petted him, and talked to him. 
The poor fellow was so happy it seemed as if 
he could not live. But he was taken care of, 
and got well, and lived many years. But never 
after that would he leave the place, though 
when his new feathers came in he could fly as 
well as ever.

    HOUSE WREN 
 
-P-A-G-E-104

-P-A-G-E-105
  HIS AFFECTIONS 81 
Canary birds often love their mistresses. I 
have heard of one who was so grieved by a harsh 
word, that in a few minutes he fell off his perch 
dead. 
These true stories show us how tender and 
loving these little creatures are, and how careful 
we should be to treat them gently and kindly. 
An interesting and true story is told by a 
clergyman in Ohio. It is a habit of wrens to 
find a good nesting-place, and then look for a 
mate to occupy it. One spring a wren chose a 
nice bird-box on his place, and held it ready for 
the expected bride. But she did not come, and 
a pair of English sparrows took a fancy to the 
same house. 
Sparrows expect to get what they want, and 
are always ready to fight for it, so they gave 
battle to the wren. But wrens also will fight ) 
for their own, and this wren held his house 
against the enemy for two weeks. Still the 
mate did not appear, and finally the lonely bird 
lost heart, and let the sparrows set up house- 
keeping in his box, though he did not go away. 
When the young sparrows were hatched, and 
feeding began, the wren suddenly became 
friendly. He hunted up small green worms, 
probably such as are good for wrenlings, and 
offered them to the young sparrows. 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  82 THE BIRD GROWN UP 
Nestlings are never known to refuse anything 
to eat, and wren food seemed to suit the sparrows, 
for they soon outgrew the nursery. 
All summer this queer thing went on. The 
sparrows reared three or four broods, and the 
wren did his full share of the work, — and not 
only of feeding the young, but of repairing and 
rebuilding the nest for each fresh brood. 
 
-P-A-G-E-107

HIS INTELLIGENCE 
Berrore people knew very much about the 
ways of birds, it was thought that they did not 
have to be taught anything, but that they knew 
everything they needed to know, as soon as they 
were born. That is, they were said to act from 
instinct alone, and not at all from reason, as we 
do. 
Another notion that people had was that birds 
of a kind were just alike; that they looked ex- 
actly like each other, all acted in the same way, 
and all sang the same song. 
But since we have begun to study birds more 
closely, we find these things are not true. \\ We 
find that birds learn things by being taught) as 
we do. Also, they find out how to do things 
themselves, and they are not all alike, as so many 
machines. 
More than this, we see that they do not look 
nor act exactly like each other. For when we 
know one robin or one oriole well, we can tell
-P-A-G-E-108
84 THE BIRD GROWN UP 
him from any other robin or oriole. And, as 1 
said before, no two of a kind sing precisely the 
same song. 
A bird shows his intelligence in many ways. 
~.Qne is by the way he acts when he cannot do as 
heis used to doing. A robin I know of wished 
to build a nest, but could not find mud to put 
into it, for it was a very dry time, and there 
were no streams near. Nowa robin’s nest must 
have mud, and the bird seemed puzzled for 
awhile. But at last she thought of a way to 
get it. 
She went to a bathing-dish that the people of 
the house kept filled with water for the birds, 
jumped into it, and got her legs very wet. 
Then she flew to the road, and tramped around 
in the dust and dirt. 
In a short time her legs had a good coating 
of mud, which she carefully picked off with her 
bill, and took to the nest she was building. 
This she did a great many times, and the 
lady who told me of it watched her till she had 
as much mud as she needed. 
A bird often shows sense by the way she 
repairs a nest that has been thrown out of place. 
Sometimes she will add a new stay, tying the 
nest to a stronger limb. One sparrow, whose 
nest broke loose, put so many stays to the 
  
mie
-P-A-G-E-109
  HIS INTELLIGENCE 85 
branch above that they made a little roof like a 
tent over it. 
Another way a bird shows reason is in seeing 
the advantage of a new place. A pair of swal- 
lows lived far out in the West, hundreds of 
miles from any house. They had no doubt 
_always nested in a cave, ora hole in a tree. But 
one day they found a house put up. It was a 
mere shed, to be used as a blacksmith shop, by a 
party of men who were looking over the country. 
At once the birds saw how nice it would be 
to have a roof over their heads. And although 
there was a big fire, and the noise of men at 
work, they built the nest over the anvil, and 
reared the family in safety. 
Woodpeckers have shown that they can learn. 
Some of them have found an easier way to get 
food than to dig through the bark of trees 
for it. 
The flicker, or golden-winged woodpecker, 
has learned that ants and other insects are good 
to eat, and now he does not think of digging 
into bark any more. 
The red-headed woodpecker has learned to 
catch flies like a common flycatcher. The yellow- 
bellied, or sapsucker, cuts holes in the trees, and 
eats the insects that come to feed on the sweet 
sap that drips from them. 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
86 THE BIRD GROWN UP 
Woodpeckers have also learned to cut a hole 
through a board and nest inside a building, in- 
stead of drilling a deep hole in the trunk of a 
tree for a nest. 
_/ Birds show intelligence when they draw us 
away from their young ones, by acting as if 
they were hurt and not able to fly.\ I have al- 
ready spoken about that. ee : 
Sometimes when a bird is caught he will lie 
quiet and pretend to be dead. But all the time 
he is looking out for a chance to fly away. 
A man who watched birds very closely once 
saw an interesting instance of their intelligence. 
They were two of the birds who get their food 
on the seashore by turning over stones and eat- 
ing the creatures hidden under them. They 
had found a big dead fish thrown up on the 
beach and half buried in sand. Under such a 
fish they were sure they should find food, so 
they went to work to turn it over. The fish 
was three and a half feet long, and the birds 
were about as big as our sandpipers. So it was 
a hard thing to do. 
First they pushed against it with their beaks 
and breast, but it did not move. Then they 
went around the other side and scratched away 
a good deal of sand from under the fish, and 
went back and tried again to turn it over. Still 
it was too heavy to stir.   
 
-P-A-G-E-111
HIS INTELLIGENCE 87 
Again they ran around the other side, scraped 
away more sand, and tried it once more. They 
kept up this work for half an hour, but did not 
succeed in stirring the great fish. 
At this time the man, who had hidden himself 
to watch them, saw another bird coming. The 
two little workers greeted him with joyful cries, 
to which he replied in the same tones. Then 
all three set to work on the heavy fish. They 
dug more sand out from the lower side, and 
then pushed against the upper side with all their 
strength. They lifted it a few inches, but it 
fell back. 
At last, after resting a few minutes, without 
moving from their places, they worked it in this 
way. They rested their breasts on the sand, 
put their beaks under, and lifted. When the 
fish was raised several inches, they held it with 
their beaks and pushed their breasts against it, 
when over it went, down the little pitch they 
had made. 
They could not stop, and they went with it, 
but at once came back and found enough to pay 
them for their hard work. 
One who really watches birds to see what 
they are doing will see many actions that show 
intelligence and reason.

HOW HE IS MADE
-P-A-G-E-114

-P-A-G-E-115
  XXI 
HIS BODY 
Di you ever think how well the bird is made 
to suit his life? Look at him. 
To fit him to move through the air in flying, 
his shape is the same that men make their boats 
to move through water. It is sharp in front to 
cut his way as he goes through, for even the air 
needs to be cut. 
It is narrower toward the back, and as he 
flies, the feet are drawn up or trail behind, and 
even the feathers lie backward. All this isso he 
can go swiftly through the air, and nothing, not 
even a feather, will hold him back. 
To keep his body upright, so that he will not 
. be top-heavy and tip over as he flies, his weight 
is mostly below the wings. 
Tf we should try to go through the air as fast: 
as a bird goes, we should find it very hard to 
breathe. But the bird is made for it. When 
you come to study his anatomy, you will see 
what a wonderful little creature he is. j 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  92 HOW HE If MADE 
He can sing while he is working very hard to 
fly upward. If you will try to sing while run- 
ning up a hill, you will see how hard it is to do 
that. 
A bird’s head is joined to his neck at one place, 
something like a hinge. Other animals, like dogs 
and cats, have two hinges, or places of joining. 
That is why a bird is able to turn his head 
around so far that he can look down his own 
back. No other creature can do so. 
Because of this, he is able to dress every 
feather on his body, and to sleep with his head 
laid back on his shoulder. 
Nearly all birds have some of their bones hol- 
) low, and air-sacs, or pockets, under the skin. 
V These sacs they can fill with air and make them- 
selves light, so that those who live in the water 
cannot sink, but float like a cork. 
Men who study the way birds are made de 
not yet know all the uses of the hollow bones 
and air-sacs. That is one of the things left for 
you young folk to find out. 
Birds who get their food in marshes, or the 
edge of the water, have long legs for wading. 
They have also long necks, so they can pick up 
food from the ground. 
- Birds who swim have webs between the toes, 
that turn their feet into paddles. <<.

  CHEWINK, OR TOWHEE
-P-A-G-E-118

-P-A-G-E-119
  
HIS BODY 93° 
Birds have very large gullets. In many cases 
the gullet leads into a place called the crop, where 
food is kept before it goes into the stomach. 
Sometimes the food is made soft in the crop, and 
then fed to the young ones, as I told you. 
Birds have no teeth, yet they eat hard seeds, 
like acorns and grains of corn. To break these 
up, and get them ready for the stomach, they 
have a gizzard, which is a sort of grinding-mill. 
And to help in the work of grinding they swal- 
low small stones. 
/ One of the wonderful things about birds is the 
height at which they can live, and not only live, 
but fly. A man cannot go higher than twenty- 
two or twenty-three thousand feet, while moving 
about or exercising, because the air is so rare he 
cannot breathe. The highest a man was ever 
known to go and live, it is said, was less than 
thirty thousand feet, and that was in a balloon, 
where he did not move. 
But birds go a good deal higher than this, 
and can fly — which is violent exercise — at 
that height. It is thought by some that the 
thinness of the air may be the cause of the great 
speed with which birds fly in that region. But 
there is still much to be found out about this. 
Besides the marvels of flight, birds have other 
powers almost as strange. Many of them can fly 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  
94 HOW HE IS MADE 
under water with perfect ease, and, more than 
that, they can, when they wish, sink slowly till 
nothing is left above water but their beaks, to 
breathe. And they can stay so as long as they 
choose, keeping still in one spot, without moving. 
A cormorant in a zoélogical garden, who 
wanted to catch some af the swallows skim- 
ming over the pond, sank his body till only his 
head was out, and held himself there perfectly 
still. 
Birds eis are hunted, as geese, have been 
known to save their lives in that way, by sink- 
ing their body under water, leaving in sight only 
the tip of the bill, which is so small it is not- 
readily seen. 
To do such things, birds must be able to make 
their bodies heavy when they choose, as well as 
light, which we know they are able to do by fill- 
ing their air-sacs with air. 
There are many things still to be found out 
about the powers of birds.  
-P-A-G-E-121

HIS BEAK AND TONGUE 
How does a bird get along without a hand? 
He has to prepare food; to keep his feathers in 
order; to build the nest; to 
feed and take care of the young; / 
and sometimes to fight other o 
birds. How can all this be . 
done without a hand ? ‘ * 1. : 
The beak is the only thing ae 
most birds have in place of a hand, and it is, | 
wonderful to see how many things they can do ~ 
with it. 
Orioles use it as a needle, in making the nest. 
With it they weave strips of soft bark or strings, 
back and forth, in and out, to make the firm 
pocket they hang on the 
elm-tree (see Fig. 1). 
A woodpecker’s beak is 
a chisel or pick, to cut a 
Fie. 2. deep hole in a tree trunk 
Bill of Woodpecker. for a nest (Fig. 2). With

  96 HOW HE IS MADE 
a nuthatch it is a hammer, to crack the nut he 
has wedged into a crevice in the bark so tightly 
it cannot slip. 
Some birds use the beak to dig in the ground, 
as the bank swallows, while the barn 
“O swallows make it a trowel, to carry 
and plaster mud (Fig. 3). All of 
y ‘them use it as a hand to feed them- 
Fic. 3. selves, and a brush and comb to dress 
Bill of Swal- their feathers. 
ce Birds need to use the beak a good 
deal, because in most cases it grows like our 
finger-nails. If they did not keep it worn off, 
it would grow so long as to trouble them. 
Sometimes when a bird lives in a cage and does 
not use his bill, it grows so long that he can 
hardly pick up his 
food. 
The —_woodcock’s 
long beak is sensitive, 
so that he can feel the 
worms, deep in the 
mud where they live. 
Many waders and 
swimmers have beaks 
soft like leather. 
You can tell by the shape of the beak how a 
bird lives, and what he eats.) The strong, hooked

-P-A-G-E-123
  ea HIS BEAK AND TONGUE ov 
beak of a hawk shows that he catches live ani- 
mals to eat (Fig. 4). The long, narrow, sharp 
bill of a heron shows that he spears his prey, 
often under water. 
The sharp-pointed bill of a warbler is to pick 
tiny insects and eggs out of blos- 
soms, and from under leaves. The 
sharp-edged bill of a sparrow (Fig. = 
5) is to break open the hard shells mal 
of seeds. Bill of Sparrow. 
The curious beak of a crossbill 
(Fig. 6) is to pick seeds out of pine 
cones. 
A duck’s wide beak, with a 
strainer at the edge, is to let water ie 
-out while keeping food in. 
spoon-shaped bill is to scoop up food, and a thin, 
flat one is to poke into narrow cracks. 
Both parts of the beak, which take the place 
of our jaws, are called mandibles, upper and 
lower. Both of them can be moved, while we 
can move only our lower jaw. 
Birds’ tongues are as curious as their beaks. 
To all birds they take the place of a finger, as 
the beak takes the place of a hand, and they 
differ as much as the beaks from each other. 
Insect eggs are very small, and often packed 
snugly into cracks and corners, and the birds:
-P-A-G-E-124
98 HOW HE IS MADE 
who eat them have a brush on the tip of the 
tongue, which brushes an egg out of its hiding- 
place very easily. 
The nuthatch picks his small grubs out of 
erevices in bark with the four-tined fork at the 
end of his tongue. 
A hummingbird’s tongue can be used as a 
tube, to draw up the honey of flowers, 
or perhaps as a pair of tweezers, to pick 
out the tiny spiders that live there. 
A woodpecker has barbs on _ his 
tongue, to spear insects hidden under 
the bark, as shown by Mr. Lucas (Fig. 
7). It is said to be sticky also, to hold 
small ones, like ants. 
The tongues of birds are of many . 
shapes, but each one is fitted to its 
owner’s way of getting a living. 
Hail Because the tongue is often horny, 
Pile: and they eat strange things, it is some- 
ofDowny times thought that birds have little sense 
ae of taste. But we cannot be sure of this, 
and we know they all have notions 
about their food. 
Dr. Ward tells a story of some geese, which 
shows that they do not lack that sense. While 
sailing upon a river he noticed on the bank 
some geese, feeding on the rinds of watermelon,, 
   
-P-A-G-E-125
  HIS BEAK AND TONGUE 99 
which they picked out of the garbage dumped 
there. 
The rind, when taken out of the mass, was 
none too clean, being covered with mud and 
other dirt. When a goose found a piece to suit 
him, he took it up, carried it to the edge, and 
dropped it into the shallow water. Then he 
stood and watched it till the running stream 
washed it clean, when he stepped into the water 
and quickly ate off the part he wanted.

HIS EYES AND EARS 
Birps’ eyes are very-different from ours. To 
begin with, they are round. Then they are 
placed one on each side of the head, so that 
_/ they can look two ways at once. Owls are the 
~ only birds who have eyes turned forward like 
ours. 
Birds’ eyes also are of many colors. Besides 
our common black, brown, blue, and gray, birds 
have light and dark green, bright red, pale and 
deep yellow and orange, even white. 
They have, like us, two eyelids. But while 
we use the upper one to close our eyes, most 
birds use the lower one. They have also a third 
eyelid, inside the others, a thin, white sort of 
skin, that moves across the eye from side to side, 
and is called the “ nictitating membrane.” 
There are other ways in which birds’ eyes 
differ from ours. The men who try to know 
. exactly how birds are made have found out that 
birds’ eyes make everything look much larger

than it is, in other words, they are like magni- 
fying glasses, or microscopes, so that a tiny in- 
sect egg, that we can hardly see, looks very big 
toa warbler. . 
Stranger still, when a bird is far off, his eyes 
are like telescopes. That is, when a hawk is 
soaring about far above the earth, he can see a 
mouse on the ground as well as if he had a tele- 
scope to look through. And the gulls who sail 
about over the shore, and follow steamers on sea 
voyages; can see small fish and tiny bits of 
bread thrown out by the passengers, even when 
they are lost to us in the foam made by the 
vessel. 
Mr. Frank Bolles had a pet barred owl, and 
used to take him out with him. He says that 
the bird’s sight was wonderful, better than his 
own aided by a strong glass. Many times the 
bird would see and watch a hawk so far off that 
Mr. Bolles with his glass could not see him until 
he came nearer, and then he looked no bigger 
than a dot against the sky. 
There is a story told of some small birds mi- 
grating over the island of Heligoland, suddenly 
coming down in a flock on to a man’s garden, 
and beginning at once to work among the 
leaves as if they were feeding. 
The owner of the garden knew they did not
-P-A-G-E-130
  102 - HOW HE IS MADE 
eat leaves, so he shot a few and found them 
stuffed with small caterpillars. Then he looked 
at the plants and found many more caterpillars, 
each in the curled-up end of a leaf. The in- 
sects could not be seen, yet the birds, while fly- 
ing over, no doubt saw the curled leaves and 
knew they were there. 
Such eyes must be of great use in helping 
birds to find their food, and to avoid their ene- 
mies. But think what giants we must look to 
them! It is no wonder they are afraid of us. 
Perhaps even more useful to a bird than his 
eyes are his ears, though they are so nicely cov- 
ered up by the feathers that we cannot see 
them. The tufts of feathers that stand up on 
some owls’ heads, and are called ears, are not 
ears at all, but merely decorations, like the 
crests of some birds and the long tail feathers of 
others. 
But because they cannot be seen, we must not 
think birds have no ears; they have very good 
ones indeed. They can hear much better than 
we can. 
Every one has seen a robin run over the grass 
and turn his head one side to listen. It is sup- 
posed that he hears the earthworm move under 
the sod, and if he is watched, he will often be 
seen to pull the worm from that very spot.
-P-A-G-E-131
  HIS EYES AND EARS 103 
When a woodpecker taps on a tree trunk and 
turns his head to listen, it is thought that he 
hears the grub stir under the bark, for when he 
begins to cut the bark away, he is pretty sure to 
find and draw it out. 
Birds that are much hunted by men, like 
ducks and geese, get to be very knowing, and 
show how wonderful is their hearing. They 
can tell the difference between a noise made by 
an animal and that made by aman. A deer or 
any animal may crash through the bushes, and 
they pay no attention to it, but if a man makes 
the least sound they are off in an instant. 
A bird’s ears are behind the eyes, and a little 
below them. They are covered by delicate fea- 
thers that hide them from sight. When the 
bird raises these feathers — perhaps to hear bet- 
ter — they look like tiny ear muffs. 
Owls have little flaps of skin with which they 
can shut up their ears when they wish to be 
quiet. This must be very useful to birds who 
prefer to sleep during the day, when nearly 
everybody else is awake and making a noise. 
Many of us who live in cities would like to be 
able to close our ears sometimes. 
Mr. Bolles tells a story about the sharp hear- 
ing of a heron. The bird was on a tree dress- 
ing his plumage, and he was hidden in some 
bushes and could not be seen.
-P-A-G-E-132
  104 HOW HE IS MADE 
Mr. Bolles made all sorts of noises to start up 
the heron and make him fly. First he imitated 
animal sounds. He quacked, and barked, and 
mewed, and brayed, and the bird looked inter- 
ested, but not at all alarmed. Then he whistled 
and sang, and at last talked plainly, but the 
bird only looked over his way, as if to see what 
new sort of beast was hidden there. 
No noise that he could make startled the 
heron in the least, until a twig snapped under 
his foot, when the bird was off like a shot. 
That sound he well knew was made by his most 
feared enemy, man.

HIS FEET AND LEGS 
A sirp always stands on his toes, not on his 
whole foot, as we do. The long slim part that 
we call the leg is really the foot, and the joint 
we see nearly up to the bird’s body is the bird’s 
heel. But in this book we will 
speak of it in the common way, 
calling the toes the foot, and the 
part up to the joint the leg. 
People all over the world have 
the same kind of feet 
and the same number 
of toes ; but with birds 
it is not so. Most of rag 
them have four toes Foot of Blackbird. 
(Fig. 8), but some 
have only three, and a few have no more than 
two, 
_/In the use of the feet there is still more 
jrariety. There are, as Dr. Coues divides them, 
‘ three kinds of feet among birds: —    
       
-P-A-G-E-134
106 HOW HE IS MADE 
First, a foot that can be used like a hand to 
clasp a perch, a “ perching foot.” 
Second, one that is good to use as a foot, but 
not at all like a hand, called a “scratching 
foot.” 
Third, one that is like neither hand nor foot, 
but a paddle, called a “ swimming foot.” 
The birds who have the first kind, the “perch- 
ing foot,” have usually three toes 
turned forward and one turned 
back.’ They can grasp a branch 
or a twig as tightly as if with a 
hand, as all our common little 
birds do. And the large birds 
of prey, such as hawks and owls 
ae (Fig. 9), hold in them live mice 
Foot of Hawk. and squirrels and the other little 
animals they eat. ; 
Some birds with perching feet have the toes 
placed another way. Woodpeckers 
have two turned forward and two 
turned back, so that they can hold bet- 
ter to a tree trunk (Fig. 10). nen 
A strange thing about the perching 5... 6 
toes is the way they are made to hold —Wooa- 
on, so that the birds can sleep on a P&E 
perch, and not fall. Inside the toes are tendons, 
something like cords, which act like elastic rub 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  
    LESSER YELLOWLEGS

  HIS FEET AND LEGS 107 
ber. When a bird bends his leg, the toes are 
drawn up and held so. When he is sitting on a 
perch, he could not fall off if he wanted to. 
Birds who have the “scratching foot,” the 
second kind, mostly go about on the ground, or 
wade in the water. They do not usually sleep 
on perches, but sleep standing, or crouch on the 
ground. In the arctic regions, where there is a 
great deal of snow, some birds with scratching 
feet, who have to go about in it, have in winter 
what has been called “snowshoes,” because 2 
enables them to walk on the snow with ease. 
It is a web-like growth on the side of each toe, 
which serves the same purpose with birds that 
snowshoes do with men, keeps them from sink« 
ing into the snow. 
Birds who have the “swimming foot,” the 
third kind, have the toes made into a paddle 
by webs stretched between them. They are the 
water birds, — ducks, geese, gulls, and others. 
The toes of all birds have long, sharp claws, 
not at all like our toe-nails. In the whip-poor- 
will and the nighthawk, one edge of the middle 
claw has teeth like a comb. 
The long slim part above the toes, what we 
call the leg, is named in the books the “ tarsus.” 
The tarsus is generally bare, with a leathery 
skin; but in some hawks and owls it is covered
-P-A-G-E-138
108 HOW HE IS MADE 
with feathers. Birds who live away up in the 
cold have feathers down on to the toes. 
On looking carefully at one of these bare 
legs, it will be seen that it is not smooth like a 
lead pencil. It is marked in a sort of pattern. 
Different species of birds show different patterns. 
Some look like the shingles on a roof; others 
like little squares or plates; and some are finer, 
like scales on a/tiny fish. 
These marks help in arranging birds in the 
books. That is, all who have the same pattern 
are said to be related. 
The legs of birds are not all of the same 
length for their size. Some who never go about 
on the ground, like hummingbirds, swallows, 
and swifts, have very short legs. Birds: who 
walk and hop on the ground have them longer, 
and birds who wade in the water have the long- 
est of all.
-P-A-G-E-139
XXV 
HIS WINGS AND TAIL 
A srrpv’s wing does not look much like our 
arm and hand, yet the bones show that they are 
the same. The bird has a shoulder, elbow, and 
wrist, as we have. He even has fingers, though 
they are so covered up by feathers that one would 
never know it. He has not so many fingers as 
we have, and they aré not movable like ours. 
A bird’s wing is a wonderful flying-machine, 
which men have been trying to imitate these 
many years. It is made of long stiff feathers, 
which fold down smoothly over one another at 
his side when he is resting, but can spread in an 
instant into a broad fan, to beat the air and 
carry him away. 
One would not think that feathers could have 
so much power; but when the wing is spread, the 
barbs of the feathers hook together with tiny 
hooks, so small a microscope is needed to see 
them ; and that, together with the edges lapping 
over each other, makes them almost like one 
solid surface.
-P-A-G-E-140
  110 HOW HE IS MADE 
Wings are not alike in shape. The wing of 
a swallow is long and narrow, while that of a 
hen or grouse is short and round. We can tell 
by the shape of a wing how a bird flies. 
A long, narrow, pointed wing shows that the 
Fig. 11. 
Wing of Swift. 
bird has an easy, skimming flight, — either he 
flies great distances, or spends hours at a time 
on wing (Fig. 11). 
The-short round wing (Fig. 12) shows that 
a bird has a strong flight for short distances. 
These wings are 
found mostly on 
rather heavy birds, 
like grouse. 
The longest wings 
are seen on water 
birds, such as the 
petrel and the frigate-bird. The shortest, also, 
are found among water birds, those who swim 
more than they fly, as the auks. 
All the feathers of the wing are named, and 
  Fig. 12. 
Wing of Sparrow.
-P-A-G-E-141
  HIS WINGS AND TAIL 111 
it will be well to remember that the long stiff 
quills are called remiges or “rowers.” These are 
firmly rooted in the flesh, and are the hardest 
to pull out. They are the most important to 
the safety of the bird. 
Birds have also another use for their wings. 
They are a strong weapon to defend themselves, 
or to fight others. A 
large bird can give a 
severe blow with his 
wing, and when pt 
geons fight, it is said 
they hold up one wing 
‘to protect themselves 
while they strike at the 
enemy with the other. 
Sometimes wings 
serve as musical instru- 
ments. Woodcocks 
make whistling sounds 
with their wings as they 
fly, and mourning doves 
softly murmuring ones. Ruffed grouse produce 
with theirs a rolling drum-like effect, and others 
rattle theirs like castanets. 
If wings are not used, they slowly get to be 
smaller and weaker, each generation having them 
more and more useless, till after a while they are 
  Fie. 13. 
Tail of Ruffed Grouse.

  112 HOW HE IS MADE 
of no use whatever, and the birds cannot fly 
at all. This has happened, it is supposed, to 
the ostrich family and to some 
birds living in the sea. 
The tail of a bird is formed of 
z an equal number of feathers in ic. 14. 5 
Tail of Vireo, / P2its, most often twelve. When 
spread they are the shape of a 
fan (Fig. 13), and when closed they lie over 
each other with the middle pair on top. 
The tail feathers are not always of the same 
length, and that makes a difference in the shape, 
of the end. Sometimes they are even (like Fig. 
  Fie. 15. 
Tail of Swallow-tailed Kite. 
14), when the tail is said to be “square.” 
Sometimes the middle feathers are a little longer 
than the outside ones, and then it is “ rounded ”
-P-A-G-E-143
“ 
  HIS WINGS AND TAIL 113 
or “pointed.” If the outside feathers are long- 
est, the tail is “forked” (Fig. 15). 
The feathers of the tail are called rectrices, 
or “rudders,” because they are supposed to be 
used to steer, or direct the bird’s course in fly- 
ing. But the tail is used also as a brake to 
check the speed in alighting. 
The tail is used more than any other organ 
to express the emotions. 
Some birds, like the cat- 
bird and thrasher, keep it 
moving nearly all the time, Fig. 16. jerking it this way and that, oil of Sepenckor 
and tossing it upward. 
In woodpeckers and swifts the tail feathers 
are not soft at the end like others, but the stems 
or shafts project beyond the feathery part, and 
are stiff like the tail of a sapsucker (Fig. 16) 
or sharp like this of the chimney swift (Fig. 
17). These birds use the tail as 
a prop to hold them against the 
tree trunk or chimney wall, and 
to help them in climbing. 
Tail feathers are not so 
strongly rooted as wing feathers, 
and are easily pulled out. Sometimes, when a 
man or boy tries to catch a bird by the tail, the 
bird will escape, leaving the tail in his hand.
-P-A-G-E-144
  XXVI 
HIS DRESS 
A sirp’s whole dress is made of feathers, but 
the feathers are not all alike. There are, indeed, 
several kinds of feathers, and four of them are 
found on every bird. There are flight feathers, 
clothing feathers, downy feathers, thread feathers, 
and powder-down feathers. 
Feathers of all kinds are made in the same 
way. All have, first, a quill, the horny part next 
to the body ; second, a shaft, the white part on 
which the barbs grow; third, the barbs, which 
grow out on each side of the shaft, and together 
are called the vane ; fourth, the barbules, or little 
barbs, growing out of the barbs; and last, the 
barbicels, which grow on the barbules, and on 
the wings have the tiny hooks which hold them 
together. 
But though feathers are made on the same 
pattern, they look very different. The wing and 
tail feathers are stiff and strong, and are called 
flight feathers,-but those on the breast and body

are called soft, and cling closely to keep the bird 
warm and dry. These are called the clothing 
feathers, because they clothe the bird. 
Down feathers, which are almost always hid- 
den under the clothing feathers, are, like their 
name, downy, and answer to.our. -clothes. 
Thread feathers grow among the clothing 
feathers, and are almost_like-hairs. It is these 
that the cook singes-off the fowls. 
Kingfishers who dive, and ducks who spend 
much time on the water, have very thick down 
under the feathers — like suits of very warm 
under- clothes — which keeps the water away 
from their bodies. Thus they can dive, or sit on 
the water hours at a time, and not feel wet at all. 
Powder-down feathers grow on some herons 
and cockatoos. They are called by that name 
because the tip ends are continually breaking off 
like white dust. Nobody knows their use. 
- Different from all these are the feathers called 
es, like the long, soft ostrich _plumes-we all 
know ; the dainty little ones that stand straight 
up, and look as if the wind would blow them 
away ; the long, showy feathers that the peacock 
spreads with so much pride, or even the pretty, 
drooping ones in the cock’s tail. 
These feathers are of no use for flight or for 
warmth, they rather hinder than help. They are er

  116 HOW HE IS MADE « 
for ornament, and there are many kinds among 
birds, all exquisitely beautiful. Nature has given 
to birds a more wonderful dress than to any 
other living creature. 
| It is with his feathers that a bird expresses his 
Yeelings. In anger he flufis them out till he 
looks twice as big as usual; we have all seen a 
hen bristle up when a dog comes near her brood. 
\/ Nervousness or excitement is shown by jerk- 
“ing the wings and tail, and if a bird wishes to 
escape notice, he can make his plumage a perfect 
disguise. Mr. Bolles’s pet owl. would stretch 
himself up long and slim, with feathers hugging 
his body, when he looked so much like a broken 
branch of a tree that Mr. Bolles could hardly 
see him. And another owl that I heard of, when 
he was on the ground, would flatten himself and 
spread his plumage around, so that the eye could 
scarcely separate him from the dead leaves about 
him. 
No one takes better care of his dress than a 
bird, and that is why it looks well for a year. 
Every day, with most birds, it is washed and care- 
fully dried, each feather being passed through 
AN the bill, and the whole thoroughly shaken out. 
\ ov Ait night one may often see robins and catbirds 
\\ \/ before going to bed, dressing their plumage 
and shaking off the day’s dust.
-P-A-G-E-149
HIS DRESS 117 
Besides washing and drying the feathers, birds 
need oil to keep them in best condition. For 
this purpose they have a little “oil jug,” a small 
gland over the tail, out of which, with the bill, 
they can squeeze a drop of oil. We often see 
ducks and geese oiling their feathers before a 
rain. 
Water birds, who need a great deal of oil to 
keep out the wet, have the oil jug very large. 
Birds seem to know perfectly well the beauty 
of theit plumage. Not only do they try to show 
it off, as the peacock when he spreads his tail, 
but they seem to feel shame when their feathers 
are injured or soiled. One white feather coming 
in where it does not belong will make a bird 
very unhappy. He will work and tug at it to 
pull it out, and often make himself actually ill 
over the trouble. I had a captive bird who 
died, I think, from worry and work over a wing 
feather which persisted in coming in white, and 
which he insisted on pulling out every time. 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
XXVII 
DIFFERENT COLORED SUITS 
A Brrp does not always wear the same colored 
dress, as I said in the chapter on moulting. (A 
goldfinch, who through the summer wears a gay 
yellow coat, comes out in the fall in plain olive 
and black; and the scarlet tanager, who flour- 
ishes in the most brilliant red, changes to a quiet 
green in winter. Besides these, some birds wear 
at one season a spotted coat, and come out after- 
wards in one of plain colors. 
Most of them change by moulting, as I ex- 
plained, the old feathers dropping out and new 
ones of another color coming in; or, to speak 
exactly, the new ones growing out and pushing 
the old ones off on their tips. But some change 
color without moulting. All birds moult com- 
pletely in the autumn, many moult partially in 
the spring, and some, as I said, change without 
moulting. 
This last change of color is made partly by 
fading, and partly by breaking off the tips of the  
-P-A-G-E-151
DIFFERENT COLORED SUITS 119 
feathers, or what is called “ abrasion.” This is a 
curious process, I told you something about it 
in chapter vii. Certain feathers have edges dif- 
ferent in color from the rest; as, for example, 
a black feather with tips of yellow. While the 
feathers are new and perfect, as they lie over 
each other like shingles on a roof, only the edges 
show, and these being yellow, the bird appears 
to be dressed in yellow. But the yellow tips are 
not so strong as the rest, and they break or wear 
off, or are pulled off in the spring. What is 
strange, they break exactly where the black 
begins. So as soon as the yellow is off, the black 
shows, and behold, the yellow bird suddenly 
becomes a black bird. 
That is the way some birds manage to put on 
their spring dress in the fall. The solid color is 
the color of the spring, but it is hidden or veiled 
by tips of another color for winter. 
| The meadowlark changes in this way. In the 
winter his coat is brownish, or buff. In the 
spring these tips are worn or broken off, and he 
comes out in yellow and black. 
Another change, even more curious, is made 
by some birds, who all winter wear white spots, 
or light scolloped edges to their feathers, and 
in spring the spots are gone. 
In these, the white or light parts only break
-P-A-G-E-152
120 HOW HE IS MADE 
off, as sharply as if cut with scissors. They leave 
the edges of the feathers notched in. queer ways, 
but as they lie over each other that does not 
show. 
Birds in this way can change color without 
changing their feathers. While moulting but 
once a year, they can show two suits, and by 
partially moulting twice, can show three suits. 
Another thing about the color of feathers is 
interesting. Some colors, such as black, and red, 
and brown, are caused. by coloring matter in the 
feather. But other colors are only an effect of 
the way the feather is made, whether it has 
ridges on it, or certain minute specks under the 
surface, which seem to act as prisms (says Dr. 
Newton), and reflect the light in different colors. 
For instance, green is always due to some 
shade of yellow coloring matter under a surface 
full of lengthwise ridges, and other colors are 
made in similar ways. 
These curious facts have been found out by 
that tell-tale little instrument the microscope, and 
no doubt it will reveal many more secrets in time. 
Color is useful to birds, as well as beautiful. 
Its great use is to conceal them from their ene- 
mies, and they show that they know this by their 
conduct. 
When a bird is of the color of dead leaves, or
-P-A-G-E-153
DIFFERENT COLORED SUITS 121 
the sand, he has only to flatten himself and keep 
still, and he is hidden. Such a bird on the nest 
will often let one come close, and even stroke 
her, while relying on her color to be unseen. A 
sitting ruffed grouse will do so. But if snow 
falls, the same bird is very wild, for she knows 
she can be seen in the snow. 
I have seen a striped bird, — black and white 
warbler, — when frightened, flatten himself on a 
branch, where he looked so much like the bark 
that he could not be seen. 
Ground birds are mostly in mottled colors of 
the ground. The whip-poor-will, whose habit it 
is to rest ona log all day, wears colors that hide 
him as well as if he were under the log. 
The striking colors on a bird are often hidden 
when he is at rest, but show plainly when he 
flies. When a flicker stands quietly on a fence 
he is all in rather dull colors, but when he flies 
he shows a large snow-white spot on his back, so 
that as far as one can see him he may be known. 
A meadowlark on the ground looks not unlike 
a flicker, but when he flies he shows that the 
outside feathers of his tail are white. This is as 
striking a mark as the white spot on the flicker. 
Many birds have such markings, and it is 
thought by men who study birds and look for 
a use in everything, that such marks serve the
-P-A-G-E-154
  122 HOW HE IS MADE 
purpose of “danger signals” or “recognition 
marks.” That by these birds can know each 
other in the dusk, or that the flash of color will 
catch the eye, when the bird does not wish to 
give a call, but to slip away quietly to avoid 
danger, and at the same time to give notice to 
other birds to do the same.

HOW HE WORKS FOR US 
Many times in this book I have spoken of the 
great value of the services of birds, in helping us 
destroy insects and weeds that injure our crops. 
But there is more to be said about it. 
From morning till night, almost the whole of 
his life, nearly every bird is working for us. He 
does not know he is working for us, of course. 
He is simply hunting for the food he likes, and 
what is good for young birds to eat. 
But what he chooses to eat himself, and to 
feed the young, consists mostly of creatures that 
destroy our fruit and vegetables, caterpillars that 
eat the leaves off our trees, worms that get into 
our apples and berries, beetles that spoil our 
roses and our potatoes, mice that eat our crops, 
and all the worms and grubs that gardeners and 
farmers are all the time fighting. 
As I have already said, some of the birds like 
cherries and green peas, and other things we 
prefer to keep for ourselves. But we should  
-P-A-G-E-158
    126 HIS RELATIONS WITH US 
never forget that they have earned, by their 
work among the worms, all they can take. 
I say this, not merely because I love the birds, 
and want to have them live and be happy, but 
because it is true. It has been proved true by 
scientific men in the service of the United States 
government. 
» These men have had thousands of birds killed 
to see what they were eating, and have found 
out that nearly all the birds they have exam- 
ined — blackbirds, cedar-birds, blue jays, hawks, 
owls, even crows — do us more good by the in- 
jurious creatures they destroy, than harm by the 
fruits and vegetables they eat.\ To this there 
is, among the small birds, but one exception, the 
English sparrow, and, of the large ones, only the 
two hawks and one owl, mentioned on page 53. 
™ Chickadees like to eat the eggs of canker- 
worms ; and for a single meal, one of these tiny 
birds will eat two hundred and fifty eggs, and 
he will take several meals a day. Now canker- 
worms destroy our apples. When they get into 
an orchard in force, it looks, as Miss Merriam 
says, as if it had been burned over. 
Robins, catbirds, and shrikes, and several oth- 
ers, like to eat cutworms, which destroy grass 
and other plants. As many as three hundred of 
them have been found in the stomach of one
-P-A-G-E-159
HOW HE WORKS FOR US 127 
robin, of course for one meal.. Ants are very 
troublesome in many ways, and three thousand 
of them have been taken from the stomach of 
one flicker. 
Rats and mice, ground squirrels and gophers, 
make great havoc in our crops, and farmers 
spend much time and labor trying to get rid of 
them ; but these creatures are the favorite food 
of most hawks and owls. 
If the farmer would stop shooting the birds, 
and protect them instead, they would do this 
work for him, and much better than he can. 
But because (as I said in a former chapter) one 
or two hawks and owls have a taste for chickens, 
he generally kills every hawk and owl he sees, 
and for this folly has to spend half his time try- 
ing to kill the little animals they would gladly 
have eaten. 
A great deal of refuse, dead sea creatures, 
and other matter, is thrown up on the seashore, 
or floats on the water. On this feed the water 
birds, — herons, gulls, terns, and others. If this 
were not disposed of, it would make us sick. 
Indeed, on the shores where so many herons have 
been killed, to get their plumes for ladies’ hats, 
the result has been sickness and death among 
the people, as Dr. Gaumer, of Yucatan, told Mr. 
Chapman.

128 HIS RELATIONS WITH US 
Besides the work they do for us in destroying 
animal life, their seed-eating is almost as useful. 
As I said, they eat the seeds of weeds that 
farmers and gardeners are all the time laboring 
to keep down, so that useful plants may have 
a chance to grow. 
The whole family of finches, sparrows, bunt- 
ings, grosbeaks, and all birds with the high, 
thick bill, though they eat largely of insects 
“ through the summer, and feed their nestlings on 
them, when insects get scarce and weed seeds 
are ripe, turn to the latter for food. They eat 
the seeds of all kinds of troublesome weeds ; and 
as each single seed might produce a plant, we 
cannot guess how much they destroy. 
Professor Beal, who is at the head of this gov- 
ernment inquiry into the food of birds, and who 
knows what he is talking about, says that one 
species of little bird —the tree sparrow — de- 
stroys every year in one of the Western States, 
many tons of the seeds of weeds. 
There is a curious and interesting fact about 
this seed-eating. The regular seed-eaters, the 
finches, prefer the seeds of certain weeds, most 
of them harmful; these they break up, taking 
off the shells, and of course destroying the germ, 
making it impossible for them to grow. 
But there are many birds who eat berries hav-
-P-A-G-E-161
\ fall. ‘ 
Thus, while seed-eating birds destroy the weeds HOW HE WORKS FOR US 129 
ing in them seeds, such as raspberries, -blackber- 
ries, and all kinds of wild fruit. These birds do 
not crack the seeds ; and, as they are hard, they 
do not digest in the stomach, but are dropped 
whole, and are ready to grow wherever they 
which are hurtful, the fruit-eaters plant the seeds 
of berries and fruit which we like. That is why 
we find wild berry bushes all over the country. 
We have to thank the birds for it. 
A great deal more could be said about the 
birds’ work for us, not only of the robins and 
those I have spoken of, but cedar-birds, who 
are shot because they take part of our cherries, 
blackbirds, because they eat some grain, ori- 
oles, because they occasionally take green peas, 
and kingbirds, because they have the name of 
eating bees, though it has been proved that they 
eat only drones, which have no sting and make 
no honey. 
Let me impress upon you two facts. First, 
the stories of the harm done by birds are often 
mere guesswork, from careless observation. For 
instance, a man seeing a bird going over his 
blossoming fruit-trees, at once concludes he is 
destroying the fruit, probably shoots him, and 
then writes to his favorite paper that a certain a 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
= 
  130 HIS RELATIONS WITH US 
bird eats fruit buds. Other papers copy it, and 
a war against that bird begins in every orchard. 
Whereas, the truth is, the bird was preserving 
the_fruit_by—picking~outthe-insects-that-would 
have spoiled-it. This is no fancy picture; this 
very thing has happened more than once. 
And again, whatever is said about the harm 
this or that bird does, never forget this second 
fact, which I repeat, and which may be relied 
upon as perfectly trustworthy. /The officers of 
the government of the United States, who have 
carefully studied the matter and found out posi- 
tively, without guesswork, what birds eat, have 
declared emphatically that every bird they have 
examined does more good by destroying: pests, 
than harm to our crops, excepting only the bird 
we have imported, — the English or house spar 
row.

Bzcavsz birds are so useful to us, as well as 
because they are so interesting and so beautiful, 
it is delightful to have them come about our 
homes. And it is not at all difficult, for they 
are easily taught to like us. 
In countries where people are gentle, and try 
to make birds happy, instead of shooting them 
or throwing stones at them, they become very 
tame. Mr. Hearn, who has written about Japan, 
says that the fearlessness of wild creatures is one 
of the most charming things about the remote 
parts of Japan, “where tourists with shotguns 
have not yet come.” 
Travelers who visit Norway tell us that birds 
are never disturbed there, and they come freely 
about the houses. When it is very cold they 
even come into the houses for food and warmth, 
and no one thinks of frightening them or trying 
to catch them. 
Even in our own country, Dr. Ridgway told
-P-A-G-E-164
s 132 HIS RELATIONS WITH US 
me of a bird-lover in Florida who would not let 
birds be annoyed on his place. As a result he 
had a great many there, and they became very 
tame. Cardinal grosbeaks, who are rather shy, 
were ‘so tame they would take food from his 
. hand. 
A person living in the country, wishing to 
draw the birds about his place, should begin by 
protecting it. Cats should not be allowed to 
come near, English sparrows should be kept 
down, and boys who shoot or throw stones should 
be banished from the vicinity. 
Next, trees and shrubs that birds like, for 
nesting and for food, should be set out. For 
nesting, a very attractive place for the smaller 
species is a thick hedge of bushes, the thicker 
and closer the better. : 
Nesting-boxes nailed up in trees please many, 
and evergreen trees will draw some that would 
not come otherwise. For food, various berry- 
“bearing shrubs and trees should be provided, 
such as chokecherry, shadberry, mulberry, and 
others. 
In a town or city, besides shrubs that birds 
like, a high fence, with a top that cats cannot 
walk on, is desirable, and a readiness to go to 
their assistance is soon appreciated. 
A friend told me a few days ago of a family
-P-A-G-E-165
  
   
-P-A-G-E-166

-P-A-G-E-167
HOW TO ATTRACT HIM ABOUT OUR HOMES 133 
of wood thrushes who nested last summer in the 
yard of her house in the city of Orange, N. J. 
The birds soon found out that some of the fam- 
ily would come to drive away strange cats which 
came in. After they learned that, when a cat 
appeared they would give a peculiar cry, unlike 
any other heard from them. On hearing this, 
one of the family always hurried out and drove 
the enemy away. 
If the birds could not get any response from 
a call at the kitchen door, they would fly to the 
front of the house, perch on the piazza rail, and 
call till some one came out. All through nesting- 
time they thus called on their friends for, protec- 
tion, and the delight the family had over the 
nest and the friendly birds amply repaid them 
for their trouble. 
The one great necessity, in both city and 
country, is water for drinking and bathing. It 
should be in a shallow dish. The rough saucer 
of a flower-pot is best, because the bird’s feet 
do not slip on it, and the edge is broad and round 
and easy to perch on. 
Next best is an earthen dish, with clea 
pebbles in the bottom, to prevent slipping, whick 
frightens them. Water should never be more 
than two inches deep, but should always be clean, 
and fresh two or three times a day.
-P-A-G-E-168
  134 HIS RELATIONS WITH US 
No food should be offered in summer, be- 
cause we want them to get their natural food of 
worms and seeds. 
In the winter it is different. They should 
have food regularly. But once used to having 
their wants supplied, they will depend upon it, 
and suffer and probably starve, if they are neg- 
lected or forgotten. So one should be very 
sure he will not get tired of it, before he teaches 
them to expect food. 
To feed them safely, a shelf must be placed 
out of the reach of cats and bad boys. On the 
sill of a window is a good place, or the roof of 
a piazza, or a little balcony. Breakfast should 
be served to them at the same hour every day, 
and they will soon know when to come for it. 
For food, they will eat any table scraps of 
meat, and vegetables, and bread, chopped fine, 
and most kinds of grain, broken up, or crushed, 
for the smaller birds. 
But the thing they all like best of everything 
is raw suet, as it comes from the butcher. A 
large piece may be wired or nailed in place, so 
that it may be picked at and not displaced, or it 
may be chopped fine and scattered on the shelf, 
like other food. All birds are fond of this. 
In winter they need water, and it should then, 
also, be fresh.  
-P-A-G-E-169
  HOW TO ATTRACT HIM ABOUT OUR HOMES 135 
A lady living in southern Ohio, who has for 
several years given a breakfast to the birds 
every day in winter, told me that her daily 
guests last season were hairy and downy wood- 
peckers, nuthatches, white and red-breasted, one 
young kinglet, a pair of chickadees, tufted tit- 
mice, blue jays, juncos, cardinal grosbeaks, Caro- 
lina wrens, and sparrows. 
This delightful company came regularly for 
breakfast, and to pay her, sang nearly through 
the season. 
In the latitude of New York there are about 
forty birds who spend the winter, and of course 
there are more as one goes south. In the 
Southern States, many of our northern birds 
may be studied in the winter. 
 
-P-A-G-E-170

HOW TO STUDY HIM 
AN attractive thing about bird study is the 
fact that there is still so much to be found out. - 
Men have been studying the dead bird for 
many years. All about the body is well known. 
.The way he is made, the arrangement of his 
bones and his organs, are plainly set forth in 
the books, in words and pictures. 
The shape and colors of his plumage, how 
many feathers belong to his wing and tail, his 
length, his extent, the shape of his beak and 
his foot,—all these facts are to be found in 
every Ornithology. 
Some of his most easily noted habits, too, are 
familiar; where and when he nests, where he 
spends his time, and where he goes in the winter, 
what he eats, and when he changes his dress. 
But really to know the living bird, to make 
acquaintance with the individual, to see his fam- 
ily life, his manners, his intelligence, his powers, 
— this kind of study has hardly begun.
-P-A-G-E-171
HOW TO STUDY HIM 137 
This almost new and most attractive field is 
open to us to-day. It offers a charming study, 
with the added interest of discoveries to be 
made. Nor is it so hard as most persons: think. 
In the beginning there are two things to 
learn: first, how to study from life; and second, 
how to identify without killing. To study is 
simply to observe closely and carefully, and to 
report accurately. 
Take a little lesson in observing: When you 
see a bird do. not merely gaze idly at him, but 
take note of everything about him. What he 
is doing, how he is doing it, and all his points, 
his size and shape, his colors and markings. 
If he is getting food, as he most often is, 
see whether he picks it from the tree trunk or 
gathers it from grass tops; whether he hunts it 
among leaves, bores the bark, drops to the 
ground, or sails out into the air for it. 
Then try to discover what it is— insect or 
seed, beetle, grub, or worm—and what he does 
with it, — swallow it at once, beat it to death, or 
hold it in his mouth uneaten. 
Then notice his manners, —if he stands still, 
or jerks his tail or body; if he flits about the 
branches, hovers before a flower, or hammers atv 
the door+of an unlucky grub behind the bark. 
Next, does he walk or hop? does he chatter or
-P-A-G-E-172
  138 HIS RELATIONS WITH US 
keep silent? fly straight, or go bounding in 
great waves through the air? All these things 
you must learn to see, and to note down the mo- 
ment you do so, so that you will not be uncer- 
tain or confused when you take your books to 
see who he is. 
Then you must take note of his size, and to 
do this —as it is hard to judge of inches — it is 
well to have in mind a sort of index of size 
to which you can compare him. Take the most 
common and best-known birds for standards, the 
robin, the English sparrow, and one smaller, — 
the wren, or the “chebec” (least flycatcher). 
When you see a bird, if he is as big as a robin, 
enter in your note: “Size, robin.” Should he 
be a little smaller, yet still larger than your 
measure,—the English sparrow,—you can 
note it, “Size, robin —,” the minus sign mean- 
ing that it is less. If he were larger, you would 
put the plus sign: “Size, robin +.” 
Observe the shape, whether it is slim like an 
oriole, or chunky like a chickadee; also any 
peculiarity of plumage, as a crest, specially long 
or strangely formed tail feathers; the end of 
the tail, whether square, rounded, pointed, or 
notched. 
Then notice the beak; its length compared to 
the head, its shape and color. If it is high and
-P-A-G-E-173
  HOW TO STUDY HIM 139 
thick, like a canary’s or spar- 
row’s, the bird is a seed- 
eater; if long and straight, 
like a robin’s, he is an in- 
sect-eater ; if sharp and flat, 
opening very wide like a 
swallow’s, he is a flycatcher. 
Lastly, note the plumage, 
the general color, then spe- 
cial markings, such as_ bars 
on wings or tail, a ring 
around the eye (Fig. 18), or 
a line over or through the 
eye (Fig. 19), white or black 
throat (Fig. 20 or 19), 
speckled or striped breast 
(Fig. 18), or any conspicu- 
ous blotch. Every point 
must be set down the mo- 
ment you notice it. You 
cannot trust your memory. 
With these full notes, re- 
turn to your study and take 
your manual to find out his 
name, or to identify. 
Many persons think that

  Fig. 19.

Warbler. 
  Fic. 20. 
White-throated Sparrow. 
in order to know a bird, and especially to find 
out his name, one must have him in the hand,
-P-A-G-E-174
  140 HIS RELATIONS WITH US 
count his wing and tail feathers, and measure 
his length. Excepting for exact scientific pur- 
poses, this isnot at all necessary. Almost any 
bird in America may be perfectly identified with- 
out touching him, indeed, while he is in the 
enjoyment of his liberty in a tree. For birds 
have marked external differences, which are 
carefully set down in the books. 
The modern manuals, too, are usually fur- 
nished with a color key, the use of which is fully 
explained in them. With the help of this you 
will have little trouble in naming your bird. 
Above all, be exact in your knowledge and 
do not jump at conclusions. If you see a bird 
on a fruit-tree picking about the blossoms, do 
not decide offhand that he is spoiling the fruit ; 
look closely to see if he is not, instead, clearing 
it of worms that would destroy it all. When 
you notice a bird in a strawberry bed, do not 
instantly conclude that he is after strawberries ; 
he doesn’t care half so much for berries as he 
does for insects, and very often he is engaged in 
ridding the plants of pests, at the moment that 
he is scared off or shot by a careless person, who 
does not wait to see whether he is friend or foe. 
Although patience and clear eyes alone will 
open many delightful secrets of bird life, a good 
opera glass will do still more. It will bring you 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  
HOW TO STUDY HIM 141 
nearer to the bird without frightening him. 
You can see thus much better, not only his 
markings, but what he is doing. In a word, 
you can be more sure of your facts. 
In deciding upon the actions of a bird, never 
guess at anything. If you see a pair very busy 
about a shrub, you may be sure they have a 
nest there, but do not so record it till you have 
actually seen the nest. Even then you should 
not conclude at once that it belongs to them; 
I have seen birds sit a few moments in nests 
which did not belong to them —as if to try 
them. You may feel very sure what a bird 
means by an action, but you should set down 
only what he does. Without this care, your 
records will be worthless. 
Do not discourage yourself by trying to find 
the name of every tiny atom in feathers that you 
see; indeed, little birds flitting about the tree- 
tops — mostly warblers— will be hard for you 
to identify, and almost impossible to watch. I 
advise you to confine your study at first to the 
larger and less lively birds, —kingbirds, robins, 
thrushes, phoebes, bluebirds, orioles, goldfinches, 
and others, all of which you will find near to 
houses and easy to study. Do not expect too 
much at once, nor give up in despair if you can- 
not identify the first bird you see.
-P-A-G-E-176
  142 HIS, RELATIONS WITH US 
You may be sure that every hour you hon- 
estly give to the study will make it more inter- 
esting; every bird you learn,to know will be 
like a new and delightful companion. 
You will lose your desire to take life or even 
to steal eggs from them; the country will have 
new charms for you; in fact, a person blessed 
with a love of the study of birds or beasts or 
insects possesses a lifelong and inexhaustible 
source of interest and happiness. 
In regard to a manual, there are now so many 
to be had, one hardly knows how to select. I 
will mention only two or three, which have par- 
ticular points of value. 
A good book to begin with, for residents of 
New England, New York, and the EHastern 
Middle States, is Professor Willcox’s “ Land 
Birds of New England” (Lee & Shepard, Bos- 
ton. Price 60 cts., by mail). 
Although this little book treats of only 
ninety birds, they are the most common, and its 
value is its simplicity, and the ease with which 
its color key enables one to identify the birds it 
treats. It introduces a beginner to the larger 
works in a most pleasirig way. 
A good general work for Eastern North 
America, thoroughly trustworthy and not too 
technical in its use of terms, treating all the
-P-A-G-E-177
  HOW TO STUDY HIM 143 
birds of the locality, is Chapman’s “ Handbook 
of the Birds of Eastern North America” (Ap- 
pleton, New York. Price $3.00). It has a 
color key and a color chart, by which one may 
see what is meant by colors named. 
Especially attractive to ladies and amateurs, 
for its charming accounts of bird life, is Mrs. 
Wright’s “ Birdcraft” (Macmillan, New York. 
Price, $3.00). It treats but two hundred. spe- 
cies, but that includes the birds usually seen in 
the New England and Northern Middle States. 
It has a color key. 
The whole United States is covered by Dr. 
Coues’s “ Key to’ North American Birds,” latest 
edition (Estes & Lauriat, Boston. Price $7.50). 
It is not quite so easy for the beginner, but it 
is untechnical in style, and fully illustrated. 
One book deserving mention because of its 
value as an aid to teachers is Miss Merriam’s 
“Birds of Village and Field ” (Houghton, Mif- 
flin & Co., Boston. Price $2.00). It is ex- 
ceptionally rich in facts and statistics relating 
to the economic value of birds. It treats nearly 
two hundred of the most common birds. 
A book intended for identification only is 
Professor Apgar’s “ Birds of the United States” 
(American Book Company, New York. Price 
$2.00). It is the result of his experience as
-P-A-G-E-178
  144 HIS RELATIONS WITH US 
teacher, and has several new features very help- 
ful to beginners, such as small cuts at the bot- 
tom of pages to explain terms, thus showing 
exactly what is meant, for example, by “wing 
bars” or “rounded tail.” It also gives hints 
about the usual locality of a bird, whether creep- 
ing over a tree trunk, on the wing, or elsewhere. 
It takes particular note of size, having one. sec- 
tion for birds about the size of an English spar- 
row, and so on. The pronunciation of the Latin 
names is carefully indicated. There are several 
chapters giving descriptions of the external parts 
of a bird, and there is a glossary of scientific 
terms. q 
The following list of points to observe in 
watching birds has been used to advantage by 
classes in bird study. A little familiarity with 
this will help one to remember what to look for. 
A similar, but fuller and more elaborate, list 
has been prepared, and bound up in tablets, to 
use in the field. It is for sale by Miss J. A. 
Clark, 1322 Twelfth Street, N. W., Washing- 
ton, D. C.

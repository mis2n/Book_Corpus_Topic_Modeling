CHAPTER XVII. 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS.! 
I. ANALYSIS OF THE STATISTICS AND REMARKS SUGGESTED THEREBY: En- 
rollment— Average attendance—Length of school term—Number of teachers—Sex 
of teachers—Supervision—School buildings—Number of sittings—School prop- 
erly— Expenditures. 
Il. Summary of statistics of city school systems, showing increase or decrease from 
previous year (Table 1)—Summary by States of population and school enrollment 
and attendance in cities of over 8,000 population (Table 2)—Similar summary of 
supervising officers, teachers, property, and expenditures ( Table 3)—Similar sum- 
mary of public evening schools (Table 4)—Comparative statistics (Table 5). 
ENROLLMENT. 
If the figures which appear in this chapter possess any significance, it is 
that the educational conditions of the cities for this year are less favorable 
than in the year preceding. The first and best evidence of this is that the 
school enrollment has not kept pace with the increase in population. While 
the latter shows a gain of 5.56 per cent, the enrollment in public schools has 
increased but 4.27 percent. The ratio of public school enrollment to total popu- 
lation has fallen from 14.74 per cent to 14.56 per cent. 
This decrease can not be ascribed to a relatively greater increase in the 
patronage of private and parochial schools, for, of the whole number of school 
attendants, the proportion who are in private schools remains the same as last 
year, namely, 21.3 per cent. Plainly the loss of one of these classes of schools 
is not due to a gain of the other class. There has been actually a relative loss 
to school instruction, 
Furthermore, this loss is not confined to any particular section of the coun- 
try, but appears in four of the five geographical divisions, the South Atlantic 
being the only one to showagain. Investigation as to the localities in which 
the lessened percentages are most conspicuous discloses several instances in 
which superintendents’ reports have proudly pointed to increased numbers in 
the schools, regardless of the fact that the population from which the pupils 
were drawn had increased in a much larger ratio. Thus it has often happened 
that school officers have congratulated themselves because of fancied increase 
in educational prosperity, while the very same facts disclosed to other minds 
indubitable proofs of lessened popularity of the schools. 
Many superintendents, however, have noticed with deep concern the failure 
of their schools to keep pace with the population, and have searched earnestly 
for causes and for remedies. Speculations as to the former and suggestions as 
to the latter have been many and varied. Butit seems probable that a point 
has been reached in the educational history of this country beyond which the 
efforts of school officials of various kinds in the cities must be redoubled in 
order to intrease the school attendance beyond the present proportion to pop- 
ulation. At this time the former opposition to the publie school system is 
almost entirely a thing of the past. The efficiency of the public schools is 
nowhere questioned, and of themselves they attract all those who desire instruc- 
tion excepting a comparatively small number who prefer private schools for 
reasons that do not concern the efficiency of the public school system. 
The facilities for instruction and the means for providing the same are almost 
without exception reasonably ample, and it may be doubted whether any con- 
siderable number of chiidren are kept from school because of lack of accommo-

dation or of teaching force. With efficient,well-equipped schools, enjoying the 
_ favor of the communities in which they are, it is evident that all efforts whose 
object is the conversion of considerable classes of people to a belief in them have 
accomplished their aim and have become no longer necessary, since nearly all 
intelligent education-seekers have become patrons of the public schools. 
But there remain a large number of persons in every city to whom school in- 
struction offers noadvantages that they can appreciate, and who, if left to them- 
selves, would never see the inside of a schoolhouse. 
It is toward this class that the efforts of school officials must be directed in 
future if they desire to increase the proportion of the population who attend 
school; and it must be remembered that such efforts must be exerted toward 
each individual, and not toward a class, and must be supplemented by such ex- 
pensive and troublesome auxiliaries as compulsory laws, truant officers, and 
truant schools. 
In fine, the time has passed for great gains in the proportion of enrollment to 
population in the cities, and in the future we may expect, instead, constant 
fluctuations, due to local rather than general causes, or even a downward ten- 
dency, since there is good ground for belief that the proportion of paupers, of 
the thriftless, and of the depraved increases in growing cities out of all propor- 
tion to the increase in population. 
It is noteworthy that in the largest cities the failure of the schools to keep 
pace numerically with the popuiation is esp2cially noticeable, The following 
table exhibits the ratios necessary to bring out this fact so far as it relates to 
the sixteen cities whose population is over 200,000, they being arranged in the 
order of their size.

  In only two of these cities, San Francisco and Buffalo, is the increase inschool 
attendants as great as that in population, and in both cases there are evidences 
that the increased proportion is only temporary, being larger than usual in the 
year for which the figures are given. The increase in enrollment in-Buffalo 
since 1880 has been irregular, being occasionally at a greater rate than the 
average increase of population, as in this year, but generally less, while the 
general tendency has been downward. In the ten years from 1880-’81 to 1890-91 
the population increased 64.80 per cent, while the school enrollment increased 
in the same time but 41.11 per cent. 
In San Francisco, the increase of population from 1880 to 1890 was 27.80 per 
cent, and the enrollment increased in the corresponding period only 12.02 per 
cent. It appears in this case that the slow increase of the public schools is, in 
part at least, explainable by the rapid development of parochial, or church, 
schools since 1885. The sudden increase in favor of the public schools in 1892 is 
probably due to some action of the managers of the church schools by which the 
public schools were benefited. 
Thus it appears that in allthe greatcities of the country the schools are losing 
ground. 
The subject is one that demands the most serious attention.
-P-A-G-E-33
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. _ 663 
AVERAGE ATTENDANCE, 
All else being equal a decrease in enrollment may be expected to be followed 
by an increase in the average of regularity of attendance on the part of those 
children who are enrolled. It is always the least earnest pupils and the chil- 
dren of the least intelligent parents who are last to seek admission to the schools, 
and the nonenrollment of thisclass tends to raise the average of attendance, since 
itis to them that low averages are principally due. The inference from the 
preceding paragraphs is that proportionally fewer of such children have sought 
admission to the schools, and one is therefore prepared to find a better showing 
in the ratio of average daily attendance to enrollment. This proportion for 
the entire country was 71.2 per cent in 1891-’92 as against 70.7 per cent in the 
previous year; the rate of actual increase during the year for this item has 
been 5.09 per cent, but even this is below the rate of increas? of total popula- 
tion. 
In instituting a comparison between the several divisions it isseen that the at- 
tendance is least regular in the citiesof the North Atlantic Division. Thismay 
excite some surprise in the minds of those familiar with the general excellence 
of the schools in that section. Butit will be remembered that in no other sec- 
tion are the compulsory laws more generally enforced than there. 
These laws require attendance of all children between certain ages for a part 
of the school year; and in their operation a class of children are brought into 
school for a limited time that would not be enrolled at all in the absence of such 
laws. Required to attend against their will, they leave as soon as the legal pe- 
riod has expired, and in the meantime the agencies which brought them in must 
be constantly employed to keep them there. Their irregularity of attendance 
and their short stay in school reduce the average of the whole to a compara- 
tively low point, but since whatever of instruction the irregular class receive is 
clear gain and would not be had under other circumstances, the low average of 
regularity that it entails is not a matter for regret, except that the period pre- 
scribed does not cover the entire school year. The newcompulsory law of Ohio 
does provide for attendance during the entire term, and it will be interesting to 
observe whether the present high ratios of regularity will be maintained under 
its operation. 
The explanation that low averages are caused by compulsory attendance is 
only a partial one, however, and can ‘not be applied in all cases where low aver- 
agesappear even in the North Atlantic Division. In Pennsylvania, for example, 
the average is noticeably low, and yet there is nocompulsory attendance law on 
the statute books. The low percentage of that State is due to the conditions 
that exist in Philadelphia, which possesses nearly half the urban population of 
the State, and in which each child enrolled attends school on an average less 
than sixty days in every one hundred. 
The high proportions in Georgia and South Carolina are undoubtedly due to 
some mode of recording statistics that differs from the methods in use else- 
where, and the apparent superiority in respect to regularity in the South At- 
lantic Division may be ascribed to thatreason. The attendance in the North 
Central Division appears from the statistics to have reached a very satisfactory 
point, namely, 74 per cent for the whole division. Ohio, Minnesota, and Kan- 
sas show especially high ratios, being, with Maine, District of Columbia, and 
Kentucky, the only States (excluding Georgia and South Carolina) in which 
three-fourths of the pupils enrolled are in constant attendance. 
LENGTH OF SCHOOL TERM. 
  In the length of the school term there has been a distinct loss this year, the 
average number of days of school having been reduced from 193.5 days to 191, and 
this, too, in the face of largely increased expenditures. The decrease has oc- 
curred principally in the older divisions where the schools are most firmly estab- 
lished, the North Atlantic Division showing a loss of 4.3 days, and the North 
Central a loss of 2.2 days. In the Western Division, too, the term has been 
reduced slightly, but both the Southern divisions show an increase, the South 
Atlantic of 4 days and the South Central 0.1. 
It is significant that while the support of the public schools is more burden- 
some upon the people of the South for well-known reasons, that is the only sec- 
tion which reports a lengthened term. But this does not imply greater devo- 
tion to the schools in the South than in the North as it may appear at first 
sight. In the South the need of money for the conduct and equipment of the 
   
-P-A-G-E-34
  664 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
schools has been a serious drawback since the inception of the system there, 
and in point of length of term the Southern cities, as well as States, have as a 
rule been behind the more favored localities, simply because:of lack of funds to 
continue. The cry there has long been for ‘‘more months of school.” On the 
contrary, in those sections where it is financially possible to maintain the 
schools continuously, if need be, numerous advocates of shorter daily sessions 
and shorter terms have arisen, and the grounds they take relate less to the 
economical advantages than to the supposed injury that school attendance 
inflicts. upon the children. 
Notwithstanding tte widespread use of physical training in the schools, the 
improvements in the heating and ventilation of schoolhouses, and close attention 
to sanitary matters generally on the part of school authorities, it is claimed by 
many thata few hours a day for nine months in the year are as many asany child 
should be required toremain in school. Regardless ofall the principles of arith- 
metic it is said, in effect, that more can be accomplished in seventy-two months 
than in eighty or eighty-eight; that better methods of teaching and the better 
health of the pupils that are expected to follow the reduction of school time 
will more than make good the difference, etc. 
It is not mentioned why the better methods and the improvementsin the cur- 
riculum often referred to in this connection could not be made with the longer 
term as well as the shorter one: nor has it been clearly proved, even if it be 
true that the health of school children is generally unsatisfactory, that an im- 
rovement would follow the partial cutting off of their school privileges. 
evertheless such arguments have had their effect upon the minds of many of 
the school boards, and a reduction in the school time of the country as a whole 
is the consequence. 
The loss is more clearly seen in the item of ‘‘aggregate attendance,” which 
shows that the whole number of days’ instruction was less by 4,951,289 days than 
it would have been if the length of the school term had beenas great as the year 
before. In other words, the loss to the sum total of instruction imparted has 
been greater because of the average loss of two days and a half than it would 
have been if there had been no schools whatever opened in the cities of either 
Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, Alabama, Mis- 
sissippi, Texas, Arkansas, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, or Colorado, or any 
of the Western States except California. bs 
The rise and growth of the city school systems of the country are practically 
things of the last fifty years; and it is interesting to note what change has oc- 
curred in that period inthe time a child was expected to devote to his school 
duties. The following figures are self-explanatory:

6 In winter. c In summer. 
The facts shown for these cities are indicative of the practices generally pre- 
vailing at the two periodsnamed. Itwas formerly the custom to keep the schools 
open nearly the entire year. Vacations of four weeks, either consecutive in the 
summer, or one week at the end of each of the four quarters, was as much time 
as was considered necessary for rest for pupils or teachers. Holidays were few,
-P-A-G-E-35
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 665 
Independence Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Day usually com- 
prising the entire list. The day’s work began at 8 or 9in the morning and con- 
tinued till midday; the afternoon session opened at 2 o’clock and continued till 
6, thcre being usually a short recess in each session. Qn Saturdays the morn- 
ing session was held, but the afternoon wasalways a holiday, and in a few places 
the schools were closed Wednesday afternoons also. 
‘There have been many departures from these practices, the constant tendency 
being toward a reduction of the time. First, the Saturday morning session was 
discontinued; then the summer vacations were lengthened; the morning ses- 
sions were shortened by deferring the opening of school till ) o'clock; the after- 
noon sessions were curtailed; new holidays were introduced; provisions were 
made for a single session on stormy days, and for closing the schools to allow 
teachers to visit other schools, and in some instances to give them opportunity 
to attend teachers’ institutes. 
A liberal estimate would give 950 hours as the actual time devoted to school 
work in a year under the present conditions, while 1,320 hours would be a mod- 
erate statement of the annual school term as it was at the beginning of the pub- 
lic school system. The boy of to-day therefore must attend school 11.1 years in 
order to receive as much instruction, quantitatively, as the boy of fifty years 
ago received in 8 years; and the plain arithmetical conclusion is that if the 
length of session and term were restored to the old figures nearly the entire 
elementary and high-school course could be completed in the time now required 
for the elementary course alone. This may not be true to its full extent, but 
that it approaches the truth can not be denied. Inthe countries of Continental 
Europe the sessions and terms have not been subjected to the steady reduction 
that our schools have suffered; it is scarcely necessary to look further than this 
for the explanation for the greater amount of work accomplished in a given 
number of years in the German and French than in the American schools. 
During the fifty-year period mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs the 
changes in the course of study have been equally as constant as the changes in 
  school term, but in this respect the change has been in the other direction, the» 
tendency being toward the addition ofnew subjects. Music, drawing, physiology 
and hygiene, elementary science, cooking, sewing, carpentry, paper fo'ding, 
modeling, all find places in the elementary course of to-day, and none of them 
was to be found among the studies pursued a half century ago. 
The improvement in the preparation of teachers, the increased care which the 
greater supply has made possible in the seiection of new appointees, and the 
better equipment of the schools in respect to material appliances, have improved 
the average character of the instruction Whether these improvements have 
been sufficient to compensate for the lessened time and the increased req uire- 
ments is a proper subject for investigation. ~ 
SUPERVISION. 
Few realize to what an extent the business of supervion has grown in this 
country within the last few years. In the year just passed the number of su- 
pervising officials in the cities reached 2,724, an increase over 1890-91 of 261, or 
10.6 per cent, a larger gain than in any other item. There is now an average 
of one supervisor to every 20.2 teachers, against one to every 21.3 last year; if 
the supervisors were equally distributed among the cities, each would have six. 
The last decade of years has been unusually fruitful in the establishment of 
normal schools; other agencies for the improvement of the teaching force have 
multiplied to a wonderful degree; and greater care has been possible in the se- 
lection of teachers than ever before. But notwithstanding all this the number 
of perscns employed to oversee them at their work has increased inastill greater 
ratio. < 
A casual glance at the meager number of superintendents and assistant su- 
perintendents whose names appear in the printed reports ordinarily conveys the 
impression that the amount of supervision performed is limited. In fact com- 
parisons are frequentiy made between cities on the basis of only the officers who 
are legally and specifically styled superintendents and assistant superintendents; 
and on that basis, complaint is sometimes made that there is still a dearth of 
supervision, because there are only one or two superintendents in each city. 
But the supposition that these are the only supervising officials is erroneous, for 
under this head must be placed all those who do notactually and regularly teach, 
but whose duty it is to observe and direct the work, either generally or in spe- 
cial lines, of those upon whom the burden of instructing the pupils reilly falls. 
The category includes not only superintendents, assistant superintendents,  
-P-A-G-E-36
  666 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
supervisors, and inspectors specifically so called, but also directors, supervisors, 
or special teachers of drawing, writing, singing, physical culture, science, sew- 
ing, kindergarten, primary methods, reading, elocution, manual training, sléjd, 
and cooking, and generally principals, or masters, heads of departments, and 
‘*floor principals.” Of course no single city can boast of all the officials named, 
put, so far as the directors of special branches are concerned, the arguments in 
favor of one apply equally to all, and if the system is right on general principles, 
no school is properly equipped that does not get the benefit of the whole list. 
The reason always assigned for the employment of a special teacher is that 
many of the regular teachers can not teach that branch effectively, and special 
assistance and direction is required to enable them to properly present their 
instruction. New subjects were originally the only ones which were supposed 
to require special irstructors; but writing, drawing, and music are no longer 
new subjects, and it can only be said in favor of them now that under special 
supervision the pupils receive better instruction because of the greater atten- 
tion to those particular branches. By far the greater number of specialists em- 
ployed are for the three branches named, while, strangely enough, the much 
more important subjects of arithmetic, language, spelling, geography, etc., 
must fare as best they may with the “regular” teacher under the guidance of 
the “regular” supervisors. 
When the number of these officials of all kinds is taken into account it will 
~ be seen that the work of supervision is not so sadly neglected afterall. On the 
contrary, the reports of superintendents themselves have in a few instances 
contained recommendations looking toward a reduction of the supervising force. 
Superintendent W. H. Maxwell, of Brooklyn, has given close attention to the 
subject of supervision generally, and his utterances in regard thereto are 
marked with clearness and vigor. In his report for 1891 he said: 
* “Principals and heads of departments do not teach classes. They are sup- 
posed to spend their whole time in supervision. There is one supervisor who 
does not teach for every eleven classes. In my judgment the number of non- 
teaching supervisors is unnecessarily large. The excessive developmentofsuper- 
vision has resulted in several clearly defined evils in our schools: 
“* First, it has withdrawn from the work of class teaching many of our_ best 
teachers, and has thus lessened the efficiency of the teaching force as a whole. 
‘Second, it has created the feeling that office work and making out examina- 
tion questions are more honorable than the active work of teaching. If teach: 
ers are to have a due moral infiuence on their pupils their office should be held 
in the highest honor. 
“ Third, the struggle for the prizes that are held up before the eyes of our 
teachers in the shape of head of department places, involving as they do, in 
most cases, considerably less work and considerably better pay, has resulted in 
much unseemly wire-pulling and intrigue, an evil always to be deprecated in 
the administration of a public school system. 
* Fourth, the multiplication of superfluous heads of departments has resulted 
in division of responsibility in school management, in petty jealousy, and in 
much harmful interference with the work of class teachers. 
“Fifth, the unnecessary increase in the number of heads of departments has 
led to much of the excessive examination of pupils, with its attendant evils of 
cramming and nervous prostration, that, though now much less than in former 
years, still hurts our school work. 
‘* Sixth, the cost of this supervision, not merely in the salaries of heads of 
departments but in the fitting up of elaborate offices with expensive furniture, 
is withdrawing each year a vast amount of money that is sadly needed for nec- 
essary work and material. y 
“A close estimate would show that not less than $30,000 per annum is expended 
on superfluous heads of departments. Surely a better use might be found for 
this money.” 
From such facts as are here set forth, it appears that in some places general 
supervision has been carried to too greatan extreme, and the only question that 
remains to be settled is where to draw the line. It is generally conceded that 
the principal of every large building, or of a group of buildings, should be in 
every sense a supervisor; that he should devote a great part of his time to the 
regulation of the affairs of the school as a whole rather than to the instruction 
of asingle class. That he should with the aid of an assistant have especial 
charge of the highest class, or of some especial subject or subjects studied by 
them, is not incompatible with this view, but on the contrary is desirable, both 
because the principal should be a teacher as well as a supervisor and should 
     
-P-A-G-E-37
    
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 667 
therefore keep in touch with the actual business of teaching no less than with 
the duties of supervision, and because the pupils should not be deprived wholly 
pete benefits of direct contact with the strongest teacher, presumably, of the 
school. 
Above the principal there should of course be the superintendent, whose busi- 
ness relates in a small degree to the details of school instruction and discipline 
but largely to the general direction of the entire system as a whole. It is evi- 
dent that the number of superintendents and assistant superintendents required 
to give unity and harmony to the school system will be reduced to a minimum, 
provided the principals aroof the right kind and act in hearty coSperation with 
each other and with the superintendent. The idea of a graded line of super- 
vising officers, ranking one above the other in military fashion, is fast disap- 
pearing, and will soon take its place with other discarded pedagogical theories, 
such as rigid annual classification, strict adherence to percented examinations 
for promotions, and all those other appendages and devices conjured up when the 
system was supposed to be the single feature which it was important to perfect. 
But there is little prospect of a decline in the idea of specialization now rep- 
resented by the system of special supervision. The results accomplished under 
it are so far superior to what had been done without it that a further extension 
seems inevitable. It is like going to another world to leave an alleged musical 
exercise in a school whcse teacher has had little musical training and less tal- 
ent, and who attempts to teach what she herself does not know, with no otha> 
guide than the ‘’ course of study ” and “ handbook ’—and then to pass to a school 
into which a skilled musician has infused a liberal share of his own enthusiasm 
and devotion to the art. Such differences as appear under these opposite con- 
ditions are the strongest arguments for specialization. It is altogether fitting 
and proper that if a subject is to be taught at all it should be placed under the 
most favorable conditions, and specializing the work of all teachers, at least in 
the higher grades, seems to bo the most probable outcome of the educational ex- 
periences and experiments of the last few years. 
The strongest argument in favor of conservatism in this matter has been the 
greater moral influence over her class that a teacher has who conducts all their 
school exercises throughout awhole year. . Butitis doubtful whether, under the 
present circumstances, the argumentstill holdsgood. The basisof the influence 
of the teacher upon the child lies in the fact that she is to a certain extent the 
embodiment of his ideal of knowicdge and goodness. But can he hold her and 
her attainments in thatsame high regard when he observes that a supervisor of 
drawing must come in to aid her to teach one thing; asupervisor of penmanship 
is necessary for another; a supervisor of physical culture furnishes the list of 
exercises for gymnastics and instructs her how to direct them; a supervisor of 
music is as far superior to the teacher as she is to the pupil; the“ floor princi- 
pai” directs how she shall punish bad little Johnny Green; the principal fre- 
quently comes in to show her how to conduct alesson in language or geography; 
the assistant superintendent and the superintendent occasionally come around 
with ‘aid and direction,” and the school trustee does likewise? Inthe end the 
pupil, by degrees and unconsciously, perhaps, is very liable to arrive at the con- 
clusion that ‘‘that teacher is not much of anybody after all, for all these other 
people have to come in and tell her what to do”—a remark which, by the way, 
was recently made by a sturdy little fellow of 12. 
It is probable, therefore, that the department system, with which experi- | 
menis are now being made in some localities, will gain favor as a means of pre- 
senting instruction by specialists, and at the same time of avoiding the evils of 
too much supervision. And there is little to be feared from any loss of moral 
influence in the transition from the present methods to an arrangement by 
which the pupil will remain under the same teachers during the entire time of 
his attendance in the higher grades, especially as each of those teachers will 
presumably know more of his or her particular branch than any of the superior 
officers, though their attainments may be broader and more general in their 
character. 
NUMBER OF TEACHERS. 
The number of teachers has increased from 52,431 to 55,057, maintaining 
nearly the same ratio of increase as the average attendance of pupils, so that 
the number of pupils to each teacher for all the cities is about the same as in 
1890-’91, namely, 36. In individual States the averages vary from 26 in South 
Dakota to 40.2 in Virginia,40.9in Mississippi, and 49.2 (which is probybly erro- 
neous) in Georgia. Between singie cities the variation is of course still greater,
-P-A-G-E-38
  668 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
while in individual cases there are extremes whichare abnormal. For example, 
in Brooklyn there were 3:9 classes in each of which over 60 pupils were regis- 
tered atone time. ‘‘Of these classes 259 had registers of between 60 and 70; 
60 classes had registers between 70 and 80; 17 classes had registers between 80 
and 90; 12 classes had registers between 90 and 100; 9 classes had registers 
between 100 and 110; 19 classes had registers between 110 and 120; 10 classes had 
registers between 120 and 130; 2 classes had registers between 130 and 140, and 
1 class had a register of over 140.” 
Brooklyn is not alone in this respect, for a similar if not equally bad state of 
affairs may be found in other great cities, certainly in all in which district lines 
are rigidly observed, and all applicants are admitted without rogard to the 
size of existing classes. 
Supt. Maxwell, of Brooklyn, discussed the subject thus in his report for 1891: 
“A table of averages can give no adequate idea of the extent to which crowd- 
ing in the lowest primary grade is tolerated. In some localities there is plenty 
of room; the class rooms are not crowded. In nearly all the newer sections of 
the city, however, the crowding is appalling. * * * 
“Tn most of these very large classes there are half-day sessions, i.c., some of 
the pupils attend only in the forenoon; the others only in the afternoon. But 
this crude device is really of very little assistance. No teacher, it matters not 
how vigorous or how skillful she may be, can teach properly more than sixty 
children. Not more than that number may be present at each session; but can 
any living being, within five hours a day, give to each one of over a hundred 
children that care and attention which at the opening more than at any other pe- 
riod of school life proper teaching demands? The first introduction to school 
life. on which so much depends for giving the right bent to the child’s mind, 
ought to be plessant, encouraging, and healthful; the opposite is the c1se—a 
vitiated atmosphere and an cverworked tezcher. The child’s first school work 
should be full of variety and unexpected delights; we give him instead a dull 
routine, enforced idleness, and unnatural restraint. 
‘“The system has not even the poor defense of necessity. It can not be claimed 
that it is necessary, unless it can be shown that in this way a larger number of 
children receive the benefits of an elementaryeducation. Thiscannot be done. 
One fact alone is sufficient to show that exactly the contrary is the case: The 
ayerege number of children promoted from the seventh primary classes’ each 
term is only 50 per cent. The average number of children promoted from the 
other grades is about 80 per cent of the register. But here, again, the average 
does not tell the whole truth. From these very large classes in the crowded 
schools, only about 30 per cent of the pupils are promoted. 
‘*Could anything tell the dreadful story more plainly? As clearly as words 
could express it, these figures proclaim the truth. The teachers of the seventh 
primary classes'do not and can not teach any but a small proportion of these 
crowds of children. They teach those whom it is possible to prepare for pro- 
motion; the remainder, by far the larger number, are left to a large extent 
untaught. The energy that should be wholly given to teaching is dissipated in 
the effort to maintain order among the untaught, so that even those whoare under 
instruction do not receive the advantages to which they are entitled. In other 
words, wr ‘le out of a class of 60 a skillful teacher will easily prepare 50 for pro- 
motion, ti.e same teacher, out of a class of 100, is not able, even with a much 
greater exertion, to prepare more than 30 or 35 for promotion. The untaught 
remain one, two, in some cases three terms in the grade before their turn to 
receive instruction arrives. After they have suffered physically through close 
confinement in a vitiated atmosphere; after they have suffered intellectually 
through the suppression of natural activity; after they have suffered morally 
through lack o! exercise of the will, they are at last put on their passage up- 
ward through our schools. Fewer children are taught, and the quality of the 
teaching is seriously deteriorated by reason of overcrowded classes.” 
      
SEX OF TEACHERS, 
It is a matter of common observation that the proportion of menin the teach- 
ing force has been growing less for a long time. The decrease from 7.20 per 
cent to 7.16 per cent during the last year hasbeen slight, but sufficient to show 
that the tendency is still in the same direction. The number of male teachers 
increased 4 39 per cent, while the females increased 5.27 per cent. 
Fifty years ago by far the greater number of teachers were men, and it has 
been but a few years since the employment of men as assistants in elementary 
schools was quite general; now it is the exception to find more than one man in

CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 669 
  any one building, the assistants’ positions being almost wholly monopolized by 
women. 
In some places they have done even better, and have captured the prinepal- 
ships as well as the minor positions. In Wilmington, Del., for instance, there 
are 193 teachers, of whom only 5 are males, and they are all employed in the 
high school. A similar condition appears in Minneapolis, Minn., where all the _ 
605 teachers are women, excepting 4 principals of high schools, 6 special teach- 
ers and 6 instructors of manual training. Substantially the same thing is true 
of several other cities, most of them being located in the West. 
The change which resulted in this condition of affairs was brought about in 
consequence of the conviction that women are naturally better fitted than men 
to be teachers of young children, and also by the lower price at which women 
may beemployed. 
The latter was at first the principal reason for the initiation of this change, 
for itwas begun at the instance of Horace Mann, Henry Barnard, and their con- 
temporaries, when the public-school system was initsinfancy. Money was scarce 
and every device that could be thought of was utilized to increase the number of 
schools and the number of people reached by them. But the change has gone 
much further than was ever intended or dreamed of by the original advocates 
of the employment of women, and further than the general sentiment of school 
men now approves. It has had many consequences that were not foreseen and 
which are difficult to overcome. The business of school teaching is coming 
to be considered a woman's business, and therefore, offers less attraction to 
young men than formerly, especially in the subordinate positions, where the 
low salaries also operate to repel them. The appointment of principals, too, 
presents new difficulties. The assistants’ positions were formerly the training 
schools of principals, and from them it was always easy to select a man to fill 
any vacancy; but now it becomes necessary either to employ a new and untried 
college graduate, to import a rustic schoslmasier, or to transfer a high-school 
assistant. The first two sources of supplv are open to the objection that there 
is too much uncertainty about the men of whose fitness for the position so 
little can be known, while the third expedient invariably weakens the fac- 
ulty of the high school. With the source of supply so curtailed it is not 
surprising that in many cases women have been promoted from subordinate po- 
sitions and made principals because no man was available about whom enough 
was known to justify the belief that he could fill the place better. The ten- 
dency thus gains force as it proceeds by constantly making it more and more 
difficult to secure good material, and there is danger that the increasing femi- 
ninity of the schools, if such a term is permissible, may be productive of se- 
rious results. The already noticeable decrease in the proportion of boys in the 
higher grades is ascribed by many to this cause, and with some show of plausi- 
bility. 
The subject is often canvassed in school reports. In many instances the em- 
ploymentof women principals is defended stoutly, afact that is not surprising in 
view of the conditions which practically shut out men from all school experience 
as subordinates. But on the contrary, there are indications that the tendency 
of the last half century will soon be checked, for from some of the most influen- 
tial educational centers in the country there has come a demand for ‘‘ more men” 
that must soon make itself felt. 
Supt. Aaron Gove, of Denver, Colo., has this to say of the matter in his report 
for 1891-92: 
“One of the most desirable reforms in the administration of the American 
common school at the present day is that whereby more men may be employed 
as teachers. Not that amanisa better teacher thana woman. ‘This is not true. 
But there are elements in the teaching profession which belong to sex, and the 
elements proper to both sexes are needed in training and character making, the 
main work of the school. A complete course of twelve years can be established 
only by an equal allotment of teachers from each sex. I would year by year al- 
ternately place the pupil under the companionship of, first, a man; second, a 
woman, and so on, from the first to the twelfth grade. Inthe present condition 
of society and of the financial world, thisisimpossible. But the change will come, 
and improvement will follow in the increase of the number of men teachers.” 
In Philadelphia, Pa., active steps have been made towards increasing the 
masculine element in the teaching force by the establishment of the ‘‘ School 
of Pedagogy’ for men, 4nd the unanimous adoption of a rule that in future 
male teachers will be appointed for the two hizhest grades of the boys’ gram- 
mar schools. 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  670 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
The considerations that led to this action are thus stated by Mr. [saac A, Shep- 
pard, president of the board of education, in his report for 1892: 
‘In this city the number of women teachers on the roll is 2,745, and tho num- 
ber of men teachers is 126. For many years past the pupils of both sexes, of 
the eleventh and twelfth grades, have been taught by women. And in multi- 
tudes of instances it has been found that in matters that pertain tothe common 
every day business of life the boys remain untaught in much that they ought to 
know. * * * 
“ As a tree is known by it: fruit, so is the worth of a teacher disclosed by the 
development of the pupil. The fact is thata woman teacher can not in the 
nature of things gain the confidence of a class of boys to the same extent that 
aman will do; and the preceptor who establishes a feeling of confidence be- 
tween himself and his pupils, gains an influence of unmeasurable value in the 
pupils’ advancement. 
“Tn 1831, the Committee on Central High School calied attention to the fact 
that ‘a more careful and thorough training of the candidates for admission into 
the school should beexacted from the lower schools.’ In 1883 President Richie, 
of the Central High School, ix his report to the Board, said: ‘ Many boys in the 
lower classes of the school seem incapable of intellectual effort either from lack 
of natural ability, or from not having been trained to habits of study. These 
boys not only derive but a minimum of benefit from the instruction given them, 
but what is worse, they retard the work of the teachers in almost all of the de- 
partments;’ and the testimony of the teachers in the higher schoolsentirely ac- 
cords with these statements. it 1887,President Steel, inhis report to the Board 
of Education, said: ‘The greatest weakness of the school department is the 
small number of men in it; and the need of the department in this respect is so 
apparent that it is beyond discussion;’ and he earnestly asked the atiention 
of the Board to the subject. In 1888, Supt. MacAlister, in his report said: - 
‘It is my conviction that the Board has now before it no more important 
question than the best means of bringing into service asufficient number of young 
men, possessing the education, character, and ambition to make successful teach- 
‘ers.’ * * * After mature deliberation, this Board, by a unanimous vote, 
wisely adopted rules which designate the places where men teachers are needed; 
namély, for the boys in the eleventh and twelfth grades.” 
The president of the Board of Education, of Chicago, Ill., Mr. Louis Nettelhorst, 
devotes a considerable part of his report for 1890-91 to the same subject, taking 
a strong stand for the restoration of the element of masculinity. The result did 
not appear in a new regulation as in Philadelphia, but during 1890-91, the 
whole number of male teachers increased from 179 to 190, and in 1891-92 to 219. 
In 1890 there was only one male assistant in the elementary schools, while in 
1892 there were 20. Mr. Nettelhorst’s recommendations and the grounds there- 
for are as follows: } 
‘Since my connection with the Board of Education the number o/ teachers in 
Chicago has increased from about seventzen hundred to three thousand. 
“At all times the fair sex has predominated toa considerable extent, but at no 
time has this been so apparent as during the last few years. Ifan extra effort 
had been made to drive out male teachers and fill their places by women the 
success could not have been better. Wherever a male principal resigned or his 
place was made vacant for some other reason, it was filled by alady. I believe 
firmly that women should have a place in our educational system, that nature 
has fitted them very well indeed to take care of and teach our growing genera- 
tion up to acertain age. Yes; I believe that they are better adapted to teach 
the lower grades than men. Their natural love for children; their kind way of 
dealing with them, and their sympathetic feeling will draw towards them the 
hearts of the little ones, and, having gained their confidence, they will find it 
a comparatively easy task to impart to them the knowledge of the rudiments of 
education successfully, while men, on account of the their more stern character 
and perhaps harshness of manner, are not as well fitted to deal with the little 
ones. Butafter the children have grown to reach a certain age, say 10 to 12 
years, I do not think it wise to intrust their education to women only. In my 
opinion it is necessary that the more sturdy character of men should be allowed 
to have an influence upon our growing generation, and while it may be necessary 
that the gentle hand of woman should guide and lead our little ones, I believe 
that the more firm hand of man should be employed in teaching the older ones 
and part in molding and shaping their character. 
‘‘ iver since the agitation was set on foot to advocate and bring about the ap- 
pointment of women as members of the Board of Education it has been used as 
an argument that the larger part of our teachers consist of women, thatat least 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
  CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 671 
  one-half of the pupils of our schools are girls, and that therefore it must neces- 
sarily follow that those whose duty it is to govern the schools should not con- 
sist of men only, but that a fair number of women ought to be appointed to take 
eare of the needs of the women teachers as well as the girl pupils. If this ar- 
gument has any value whatever, if there is any good reason to have women on 
our board because there are female teachers and girls in our schools, the argu- 
ment will also hold good that we should have a sufficient number of male teach- 
ers because about one-half of our pupils are boys. Whenever a family has lost 
the father while the children of the family are still of thatage during which 
they need guidance on the part of the parents, it will show, with only very rare 
exceptions ' to note, that the mother alone was not fully able to cope with the 
problem before her, and that the boys and girls in after life feel the lack of 
training by the strong hand of a man. It wiil necessarily follow ‘that in our 
schools where our children pass a large part of their time the lack of masculine 
element among the teachers must show as well. A man (if heis theright kind 
of a person, and if not he has no place there) will inspire the children with 
more respect, after they have advanced toa certain age, than a woman, and they 
therefore will be more ready to listen to the teachings of the man and pursue 
their studies more diligently than if they are in the hands of a woman. 
“it can undoubtedly be shown that some women are fully as able as men to 
inspire the children and have their respect to as fuli an extent, but if we look 
at these women we will always find in their character and their make-up some 
very prominent traits of the masculine character. I believe it will be one of the 
duties of the board to bring about some system by which our young men, who 
come to us with a college and university training, or who come as graduates of 
teachers’ s2minaries, are not turned away as has been done in the past, simply 
because thesentimentis against them and we have been accustomed tosee women 
only in our public schools. Attho present time we have hardly any male teach- 
ers in our pe imary and grammar grades and only a small number of male prin- 
cipals, our high schools only showing a fair percentage of the male sex among 
our teachers. At the end of our school year the official list shows the’ total 
number of teachers employed to be 3,001. Of these 190 are men (of these 190, 68 
are employed in the high schools, 26 are teachers of special branches, and 94 are 
teachers and principals in our primary and grammar grades), while 2,8ll-are 
women. These figures, whichare taken from the official records, ought to be suf- 
ficientto show thatI am right in asking the appointment of more male teachers.” 
SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
The number of school buildings shows an increase over 1890-91 of 303, or 4.67 
per cent, while the number of sittings is greater by 116,098, or 4.96 per cent, than 
last ye This indicates a tendency to erect larger buildings. 
There is no uniform policy in regard to the size or arrangement of buildings, 
and the circumstances of each par ‘ticular case almost invariably determine the 
character of the structure. In the smaller cities two stories with eight rooms 
is the size most commonly found, and the number expressed in the ‘‘average 
size of buildings” 7. ¢., 370, expresses with greater correctness than averages 
usually do the number of pupils that may be accommodated in a typical building 
of this, the commonest kind. 
In the great cities, however, the compact population and the high cost of land 
have led to the erection of immense edifices, each capable of accommodating as 
many pupils as are found in the entire school systems of half the cities of the 
country. 
In New York City, of the eight new buildings in progress of erection one will 
have 1,735 sittings, another 1,848, another 2,016, still another 2,352, and two oth- 
ers will accommodate 2,520 pupils each. Buteven these are not the largest in 
the city. Grammar school No. 90, erected in 1890, contains 2,633 sittings, and 
another new building was furnished in 1891 with 2,722 sittings. Each of these 
buildings is four stories high, and of course does not leave much o/ the lot for a 
playground. The first cost of one of them would entirely support the schools 
of the average city of 25,000 inhabitants for four years. Grammar School No. 
90 cost $245,000, in addition tothe value of the lot, which was $30,000, a very 
moderate price for a school site in New York, for an examination of the list 
shows one valued at $135,000, another at $147, 000, another at $157,000, and finally, 
one at $165,000. Fifty sites are worth $50, 000 or more. 
As New York at this time represents the maximum of urban growth and of 
density of population, so its buildings represent the maximum size in school- 
   
-P-A-G-E-42
672 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  house construction in this country and with probably not more than two excep- 
tions in the world. 
In London may be found the largest buildings ever erected at one time in Eu- 
rope for public elementary schools, pure and simple, but the greatestof them all, 
the “‘Hugh Myddelton,” recently completed, accommodates only 2,150, and cost 
£62,000, or about $310,000. Or this, £20,634 were for the site, so that the New 
York structure exceeds it both in value and capacity. Only one other London 
‘‘boxrd school”? accommodates as many as 2,000 pupils. Brooklyn, as well as 
New York, far surpasses this record. 
The famous Jews’ Free School,in London, a privately endowed institution 
receiving Government grants, is one of the exceptions mentioned above as 
being more capacious than any building in this country. In the words of 
one of those in authority in the school: ‘‘It having become evident, in 1883, 
that the buildings were no longer adapted to the demands, new plans were 
formed, and in March, 1884, the old buildings were demolished, and on their 
site a magnificent set of class rooms, surrounding a great central hall, was 
erected at a cost of £25,000. By thismeans the school was rendered capable of 
accommodating 2,250 boys and 1,250 girls, and in a very short time those num- 
bers of children were entered on the school registers.” This may, or may not, 
mean that the ‘‘ set ofclass rooms ” and the “great hall” are allunder a single 
roof; but whether this is the case or not, there remains the fact that all that 
army of children form a single school under the control of a single head master, 
and though the building may not be more notable in size thanin value, the 
school must be ranked as one of the most numerously attended in the world. 
But there is another school which surpasses this in size, though its growth 
to its enormous proportions was due to motives of economy rather than to a 
policy favoring large schools. The school is in M ilhausen, Alsace, and is thus 
described in Dr. L. R. Klemm’s book on European Schools: ‘‘I found a unicum 
of aschool here, such as I hope never again to see —a school containing no less 
than sixty-two class rooms, several offices, and the rector’s dwelling, all in a 
conglomerate of buildings rickety and shabby. The pupils on the third floor 
must wait till the otler floors are empty before they can be dismissed. The 
whole building is one dangerous mantrap. In case of fire thousands of chil- 
dren's lives would be indanger. This school is a blot upon the fair reputation 
of the city of Mtlhausen.” 
It is said that this school isseveral centuries old; its growth has been provided 
for by repeated additions to the original structure, the idea being each time to 
save the cost of one wail by tacking on a new wing to the old building instead 
of establishing a new and separate school, which would necessitate four new 
walls instead of three; the pupils are seated upon benches, each of which holds 
six or eight children; there are twelve benches in each room, and the whole 
number of children in the school is not less than 4,464. 
It has never been the policy of the school officials of the second city of the 
Union, Chicago, to erect such monster buildings as those described; the largest 
one in use, the Newberry, accommodates 1,320 pupils. At the present time most 
of the buildings erected in the populous districts of the city have 16 rooms and 
an assembly hall which can be converted into 2 class rooms, if necessity demands 
it. These buildings are of three stories. with 6 rooms on each of the two lower 
floors and 4 rooms and the assembly hall in the third story. The seating 
capacity of each is about 864 in addition to the hall. 
The most striking feature of the Philadelphia schoolhouses is that the class 
rooms are separated from each other only by movable partitions, which permit 
of the ready conversion of a series of rooms into a single long hall for general 
exercises. There seems to be no standard size or plan for the buildings in this 
city, and those recently erected contain 10, 12, 15, 18, or 21 rooms or divisions, 
apparently according to the existing needs of the pa: ticular locality in which 
the building is situated. The James Logan school, which seems to be one of 
the largest if not the largest building in the city, has 24 rooms on three stories, 
and had 1,563 pupils belonging at the beginning of the year. 
Brooklyn is like New York in its mammoth buildings, there being ahalf dozen 
or more which accommodate over 2,000 pupils each, and several others whose 
capacity is between 1,500 and 2,000. The largest of them all, however, doesnot 
quite reach the 2,500 mark. 
The largest buildings in St. Louis accommodate from 1,200 to 1,500 persons, 
and the present policy of the board, as indicated by the character of the houses 
erected since 1885, favors buildings of not more than twelve rooms, accommo- 
dating about 700 pupils.

CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 673 
  In Boston, the plan of school organization differs from that of the cities out- 
side of New England, in that primary schools are not conducted in the same 
buildings with grammar schools. The grammar school, embracing six years of 
th» couse, forms the center pedagogically, and if possible geographically, of 
these ooldistrict. Aroundit the primary schools, in which the first three years’ 
work is done, are plac:d in the best locations available for the convenience of 
the pupils. The buildings used in the pursuit of this plan are small as com- 
pared with those in the cities mentioned above, the most numerously attended 
having but 1,000 pupils; all the others with one exception have less than 800. 
The new Thomas N. Hart building, which is considered one of the best in the 
city, has 13 class rooms and an assembly hall, arranged in three stories, there 
being 5 rooms on the first floor, 6 on the second, and 2 rooms and the hall on the 
third. 
In Baltimore, Md., there are but two elementary school buildings that are 
valued at as much as $35,000. The officials complain that the appropriations 
are insufficient to construct buildings large.enough to provide for reasonable 
gvowth of the schools; and that a model school building, embodying the best 
features of the older buildings and omitting their defects, is greatly needed. 
None of the buildings erected up to this time are provided with assembly halls. 
In San Francisco, Cincinnati, and Cleveland the buildings, like those of Chi- 
cago, vary in capacity from 500 to 1,300, the majority having accommodations 
for less than a thousand. In Cleveland, however, two or three have nearly 
1,509 sittings. 
The ten American cities mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs are the most 
populous in the country, and while their plans and methods may not be the 
ideal ones, they undoubtedly represent in their different types the conditions 
which may be naturally expected of all other cities when time and the remark- 
able tendency of the American people to congregate in cities has brought them 
up to the size of the great cities named. Their schools, therefore, in this sense 
may be siid to be the resulting types of the half century’s development of the 
American public school, and as such their features are worthy of especial study. 
Among the smaller cities, the buildings of Denver, Colo., whose population 
is slightly over 100,000, are most frequently praised. Uniformly two stories 
high, of not more than 12 rooms, excepting the high school, with ample light, 
eir. and floor space for each pupil, satisfactory apparatus for heat and ventila- 
tion, good arrangement of rooms and stairways, they have served as models for 
many of the best buildings of other cities. It may be well to state, however, 
that in designing them the architect was evidently not hampered with a strin- 
gency in the money supply, such as frequently or generally exists in cities of 
like size when a new schoolhouse is desired. To illustrate: The high school 
building was erected upon land donated by the General Government, and has 
cost $354,195.41; the estimated value of the site is $414,000, making the entire 
value of the property considerably over three-quarters of a million dollars. The 
new Swansea building cost $78,053; the Corona, $87,901, and the Wyman, $94,570, 
Compare the value of the Baltimore buildings with these figures, and the cause 
for the dissatisfaction of the officials of that city may be b2tter understood. 
NUMBER OF SITTINGS. 
The accommodations for pupils as compared with the number inaverage daily 
attendance are somewhat less ample than in the last year.. In 1890-91 there 
were 136.7 seats for every 100 in actual attendance, while there were 136 during 
the year just past. The average attendance increased 5.09 per cent, while the 
number of sittings increased 4.96 per cent. The difference is very slight, and 
would not possess any significance but for the fact that it is one of many statis- 
tical indications that 1891—’92 was unfavorable for school work. 
It would probably be well to repeat that this comparison of sittings with av- 
erage attendance is not intended to show the actual degree of sufficiency of 
accommodations in any individual instance, but merely as a means of compari- 
son between localities and dates. 
The sufficiency or insufficiency of school accommodations in a quantitative 
sense is a matter which it is very difficult if not impossible to determine sta- 
tistically. It is certainly not necessary that there should in any case beas many 
seats as there are pupils enrolled, for not all of them are in attendance. the year 
around. Nor is the average attendance the proper measure of the number of 
seats needed, for a t:mporary absence of a pupil or pupils cin not be made the 
occasion for the shifting of the seating arrangements without serious confusion 
ED 92. 43,   
   
-P-A-G-E-44
    674 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
and inconvenience. There must, therefore, be more seats than there are pupils 
actually present. If it were possible to get a satisfactory and uniform defini- 
tion of the ‘average number belonging,’ either that quantity or the ‘‘ greatest 
number belonging at any one time” would be the better criterion by which to 
judge. 
; But even that would be exceedingly defective, for if the seats were as many 
as the greatest number belonging that would not necessarily indicate that there 
were enough, because of the impossibility of so locating buildings and accom- 
modations as to precisely meet the necessities of the school population. 
The reasons for this difficulty are stated by Supt. W. E. Robinson, of Detroit, 
Mich., to be ‘‘the rapid growth in the population in some of the newer portions 
of the city, the floating population in certain other parts, and the variation in 
the numbers promoted half-yearly from grade to grade and class to class.” 
In his characteristic vein, Supt. A. P. Marble, of Worcester, Mass., says: ‘‘ The 
reason for this excess is apparent when we consider that the pupilscan not always 
be sent to the houses where the extra seats are; for example, the seats in a 
suburban school can not be made to accommodate pupils in the high school any 
more than the vacant seats in one train of cars will accommodate the extra pas- 
sengers in another train.” 
The greatest trouble experienced in the matter of providing accommodations 
seems to be the difficulty in persuading those who hold the purse strings toerect 
buildings in advance of present needs. The steady growth of our cities and 
schools is a matter which does not admit of doubt, but nothing seems harder for 
a city councilman to understand than the necessity for going to the expense of 
building a house for 800 children that were not in school last year. Of course 
when the next year has rolled around and the 800 new children have come in, 
he will see that it would be a good thing to have another house rather than 
have the children sit on the edge of the teacher’s platforms and on the radiators, 
and then he is willing to appropriate the money for a new building to be ready 
for the children on the perches by the beginning of the next year. But by that 
time 800 or more other new children have arrived, and the same process is 
repeated. In this way and for this‘reason a great many, if not a majority, of 
the cities of the country are about a year behind in the erection of buildings. 
There is no disposition on the part of the public officers of any city to cripple 
the schools or to withhold the funds necessary for their proper support. But 
the demands upon every city’s treasury are many, and the aggregate of the esti- 
mates of the several departments invariably exceeds the annual revenue. Then 
in the general scaling down which always follows, woe be unto the schoolhouse 
asked for by the board of educaticn if the superintendent has indiscreetly hinted 
at ‘‘ building for thefuture” in his recommendation! The reply is, ‘‘ We can take 
‘eare of the future when it comes. There are expenditures now needed that will 
take all our money without providing for the demands concerning the next gen- 
eration.’ 
To this is due the most of the complaint concerning insufficient accommo- 
dations. There are, to be sure, many instances of neglect, more or less flag- 
rant, of the just and reasonable demands of the schools in the matter of 
buildings, but the neglect has been of short duration, and after a few years of 
inaction the authorities have always awakened suddenly to a sense of their 
duty, and have gone to work with feverish haste to make up lost ground. 
SCHOOL PROPERTY. 
The value of school property shows an increase over last year of $9,100,729, 
or 4.93 per cent. This increase has been larger proportionately than that in the 
number of buildings, which indicates a greater average value per building—a 
result which naturally follows the increased size of buildings noted in a previ- 
ous paragraph. But the increase in value isless in proportion than the increase 
in number of sittings, which merely adds another proof to the well-known ex- 
perience that within certain limits the cost of building does not increase in direct 
ratio with the capacity of the structure. For example, a three-story house costs 
much less than 50 per cent more than one of two stories, because the cost for 
foundation and roof is practically the same in both cases. 
The value of school property in this connection must be understood to mean 
the value of property owned by the public authorities and used for school pur- 
poses. Furniture, apparatus, school libraries, etc., are included as well as real 
property, but lands held for purposes of revenue and rented property are not. 
Some of the Western cities, notably St. Louis and Chicago, are particularly
-P-A-G-E-45
  
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 675 
  fortunate in the possession of valuable property from the rental of which acon- 
siderable portion of their revenue is derived. Chicago received $225,634 from 
this source in 1891-92, and St. Louis received $54,235. 
The possession of this property is » result of the long-established policy of 
the United States Government to set aside two sections for school purposes out 
of every township newly opened for settlement. Chicago’s school land is situ- 
ated partly in the heart of the city, and has increased enormously in value, 
being worth now several millions. 
The General Government has, in a few instances, given aid to city schools in 
otherand more direct ways than in the reservation of schoollands. For instance, 
the site of the Denver High School is a block which was donated by the United 
States; and the schools of Fort Smith, Ark., are supported mainly by the reve- 
nue from a gift of the National Government in the shape of an abandoned mil- 
itary reservation. 
Rented property plays a very small part in the school economy of our cities, 
and its use is always a makeshift to serve till arrangements can be made for the 
occupation of quarters owned by the cities themselves. It is almost impossible 
to rent buildings suitable for school purposes. To meet the wants of a school, 
the building must have beendesigned for aschool. Butprivate capital is rarely 
employed nowadays in the erection of schoolhouses, excepting, of course, for the 
church schools, and never for the purpose of renting them, as is frequently the 
case in nearly every other class of buildings. In case of emergency, therefore, 
in which the city’s school property does not suffice for its needs, whatever is 
available must be taken, and that usuaily means an old hall, church, store, or 
even dwelling. It goes without saying that in light, heat, and ventilation such 
quarters are exceedingly defective, and their use is justified only by urgent 
necessity, and is continued no longer than is absolutely necessary. 
It is the policy of most cities to erect their schoolhouses upon land owned by 
them in fee simple, but in a few instances the local customs make it generally 
impossible to secure lotsin thatway. Baltimore is the most conspicuous exam- 
ple of this, for in the city proper only about a half dozen of the school sites are 
owned in fee, while more thrn seventy are leased, and require a large annual 
payment of “ground rent.” The policy of the board, however, in recent years 
at least, is to secure the ground in fee simple whenever it is possible. 
EXPENDITURES. 2 
Exeept in the number of supervising officers the greatest increase for the year 
is in the matter ofexpenditure. The cost of supervisionand teaching was greater 
than last year by 6.83 per cent, and the total expenditure was greater by 6.36 
percent. The whole amount expended for schools by the 459 city systems was 
$60,555,120, a sum by no means niggardly, being equivalent to a contribution of 
$3.17 from every man, woman, and child in the population of those cities. For- 
each pupil in average attendance, the average amount spentforall purposes was 
$30.58. Of this $17.86 were for instruction pure and simple, embracing only the 
cost of teaching and of the supervision of teaching. The remainder was for inci- 
dentals of various kinds, supplies, text-books, janitors’ wages, repairs, furniture, 
and new buildings, and, in fact, everything for which money was spent during 
the year, except the single item of tuition. The repayment of loans and bonds 
are not and should not be included, for the obvious reason that misleading 
duplication would becaused thereby. For example: Cities frequently negotiate 
temporary loans in anticipation of expected receipts. Suppose thatacity should 
borrow each month the money for the teachers’ salaries in order to pay them 
promptly, repaying the loan every time afew days after. It is plain that only 
the money paid to the teachers was actually spent for the schools, yetif all the 
money disbursed were included, it would appear thatthe cost of the schools was 
just twice as much as it really was. All loans and bonds rest upon the same 
basis, and add to the actual cost of the schools only tothe extent of the interest 
paid on them. 
Since the expenditures increased during the year at a greater rate than any 
of the items of enrollment and attendance it naturally follows that the cost per 
capita is also greater. The expense for tuition per pupil in average attendance 
was greater by 21 cents than last year, and the expenditure for all purposes was 
27 cents more. Every day that a city child went to school during the year, he 
cost-on an average 16.02 cents; of this, 9.35 cents were for his direct instruction. 
Both these items are larger than in the previous year. 
It is interesting to note that the purposes for some of this increased expense 
are brought out in the statistics. In the first place the great increase in the
-P-A-G-E-46
  676 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
number of supervising officers undoubtedly affects the cost of tuition to a con- 
siderable extent, and largely, if not entirely, accounts for the differenco in its 
per capita cost. 
In regard to expenditure other than that for tuition the increase is due to sev- 
eral circumstances. The public are more inclined to be liberal in money matters 
with the schools than ever before, because they very generally appreciate the 
work of the schools, and because they are more than at any previous period accus- 
tomed to associate generous expenditures with good schools. Therefore it has 
been possible to secure sums for furnishing the schools with improved sanitary 
arrangements, apparatus for instruction, and supplies of every kind, which a 
generation ago would have been considered by the authorities as useless extrav- 
agance and would have been promptly refused. Besides, certain new featuresof 
the schools have been the occasion of a great deal of expense not required in 
past years. Let us mention a few of them: 
The free text-book system is growing in popularity, and its adoption by an 
increasing number of cities adds each year to the aggregate amount expended. 
Physical training is becoming popular and demands more or less of apparatus 
of the lighter sort under any system, and in many cases complete gymnasiums 
haye been fitted up at a considerable cost. 
Themodernand mostapproved methods of instruction, notably in the sciences, 
demand ample laboratory facilities. Geography, physics, chemistry, geology, 
etc., now require the expenditure of money for apparatus that the old-time text- 
book teacher never dreamed of the possibility of securing. 
Manual training is constantly gaining ground, and wherever it is begun there 
must be shops for carpentry, forges, furnaces, and machines for iron-working, 
materials for sewing,and school kitchens for instruction in domestic economy, 
not to mention the colored paper, modeling clay, and other material required for 
the lower grades. 
The kindergarten idea is rapidly spreading, and is attended with the pur- 
chase of the characteristic material required for the peculiar work, of course, 
but still more important, it frequently involves the provision of new and special 
furniture, musical instruments, and even new buildings. 
Compulsory attendance laws are being diligently enforced in several States 
and the agencies necessary therefor are expensive and additional to the usual 
requirements of the schools. Truant officers and truant schools are necessities 
which have grown out of the new state of a‘fairs, and must be maintained wher- 
ever an earnest effort is made to enforce the law. 
Certain changes in matters of discipline and classification have caused new 
items to be added to the expense account of many cities. The total or partial 
abolishment of corporal punishment has been followed by the establishment of 
“schools for incorrigibles” in many instances, and ‘‘ ungraded classes” for back- 
ward or for unusually bright pupils are maintained in some localities to avoid 
the evils of long intervals between classes. These schools are in the nature of 
“extras,” and while their ultimate result is a saving of money by hastening the 
progress of the children, their immediate effect is an addition to the school 
budget. 
All these features are among the developments of the lastfew years. They 
are not yet universal, or even general, but all are growing in favor, and eich 
year sees the addition of one or more of them toa very respectable number of 
city systems. All are expensive in a greater or less degree, and so long as their 
extension continues, just so long may an annual increase be expected in the per 
capita as well as the absolute cost of city schools, unless indeed some unex- 
pected calamity or some ill-advised movement should occur to hinder the pres- 
ent favorable progress of public education. 
But in addition to these features in the nature of permanent improvements in 
the system, there has been one item of expenditure which has appeared in the 
accounts for 1891-92, and is only temporary in its character, but which amounts 
to a goodly sum in the aggregate, because nearly all the cities report it, namely, 
preparation for the World’s Columbian Exposition at Chicago. The expense 
attending the preparation and care of the exhibits varied from a few hundred 
dollars to several thousand. In addition to this and related to it was the cele- 
bration of Columbus Day, October 12, 1892, in honor of the discovery of Amer- 
ica four centuries before. The occasion was commemorated, either by formal 
exercises or by processions, in probably every city in the country. 
These two events entailed a great deal of extra work upon the teachers and 
pupils, and seriousiy interfered with the even tenor of school work for a consid- 
erable time. Though the ultimate results, especially of the World’s Fair ex-
-P-A-G-E-47

hibit, must necessarily be beneficial to American education, there can be no 
doubt that the immediate effects were by no means favorable. In fact, one of 
the potent reasons for the bad showing in the statistics of the year may be found 
in this.

  CHAPTER XVIII. 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
A.—Public high schools. B.—Academies, preparatory schools, private high schools, ete. 
The great interest taken in the subject of education in secondary schools the past 
few years has been emphasized by the National Educational Association in the appoint- 
ment of a special committee to consider the relation of the secondary schools to the 
colleges and universities. 
The exact place of the secondary school has not been definitely determined, and 
the office of this committee, and the subcommittees appointed by it, was to investi- 
gate the whole subject of secondary instruction and present the results of their 
deliberations in a consolidated report. By this means if was expected to show what 
the relation of these schools to the colleges is, especially in regard to the studies to 
be pursued. In the reports of the Bureau of Education the attempt has been made 
to collect the most complete data possible from these schools and make all of it 
available for comparison and study. For three years the statistics have included 
the public high schools, as well as private institutions of secondary grade. The 
statistics of these two classes of institutions have been compared with each other as 
far as possible, and for the report of 1890~91 special tables and diagrams were pre- 
pared to show the growth and the comparative increase of each class. Each year the 
figures given become more complete, and certain of the percentages may be regarded. 
as virtually correct, although not all the schools are reported. This is specially true 
in regard to the studies pursued at these schools and about which, perhaps, the 
greatest interest centers at the present time. If we have complete reports from three- 
fourths of the schools, then the percentages of those reported in matters relating to 
studies pursued may be taken fairly to represent the other fourth not reported, and 
we may thus get the average condition of the schools throughout the country. 
, One of the difficult questions has been to eliminate the students of the elementary 
grade found in quite a number of these schools; it is believed that this has prac- 
tically been done, and that the students given in the tables all properly belong to the 
secondary or preparatory school grade. 
In the year 1889-90, reports were received from 2,526 public high schools, with 
9,120 teachers and 202,963 students. In 1890-91, 2,773 schools reported, with 8,270 
teachers and 211,598 students. This year (1891~92), 3,035 schools are reported, with 
9,564 teachers and 239,584 students. 
Of the private academies, preparatory schools, and private high schools, there 
were reported in 1889-90, 1,632 schools, with 7,209 teachers and 94,931 students. In 
1890-91, there were reported 1,773 schools, with 6,231 teachers and 98,400 students; 
while this year (1891-’92), the reports show 1,550 schools, with 7,093 teachers and 
100,739 students. 
The seeming discrepancy in some of these figures in both classes of schools comes 
from the imperfect classification of the students and teachers into elementary and 
secondary in cases where the enrollment of the school included pupils below the 
academic or high-school grade. But this matter is being gradually accommodated 
to the conditions of the various schools, and will doubtless soon be sufficiently exact 
for practical purposes. The relative changes in the number of students, the number 
pursuing certain studies, etc., can best be seen by comparing the data from these 
two classes of schools for a period of years. 
SUMMARIES OF STATISTICS, 1891-92. 
I.—Public high schools. 
The two following tables of summaries are arranged for comparing the two classes 
of schools, public and private, and each is arranged by geographical divisions and 
by States and Territories.* Table I gives the number of schools, instructors, and 
students in the public high schools. 
Of the 3,035 schools reported in this table, 1,571 are in the North Central Division; 
900 in the North Atiantic Division; 244 in the South Central Division; 189 in the 
South Atlantic Division; and 131 in the Western Division. Of the 9,564 instructors 
in these schools, 4,714 are in the North Central Division; 3,282 in the North Atlan- 
tic Division; 626 in the South Central Division; 528 in the South Atlantic Division, 
and 414 in the Western Division. Of the 239,556 public high-school students in the 
country, 117,261 are in the North Central Division; 85,628 in the North Atlantic 
Division; 13,720 in the South Central Division; 12,556 in the South Atlantic Divi- 
sion, and 10,39L in the Western Division. It is interesting to note that in every part 
of the country there has been a substantial increase in the number of students dur- 
ing the past year. 
*In addition to the number of secondary students reported in the above tables there are of these students 4,67 in the public normal schools and 4,315 in the private normal schools; 1,951 inthe manual training schools; 50,910 in the preparatory depart- ments of higher stitutions, These added to the number reported from the secondary schools would make a total of 402,118 students,

      Diagram 1 shows the relation of both classes of schools as to their number, num- 
ber of instructors, number of students, also number of students preparing for col- 
lego in both courses, the number in the graduating class, and the number of gradu- 
ates for the year. It is scen that, so far as reported, the public high schools are over 
66 per cent of the whole number, and have over 57 per cent of the instructors and 
70 per cent of the students, in each of these a slight gain over the past year. Of 
those preparing for college, in the classical course 48.78 per cent are in the public and 
51.22 per cent in the privato high schools, while in the scientific course the public 
high schools have 61.63 per cent and the private high schools 38.37 per cent. Of 
those preparing for college, in the graduating class both courses, almost 64 per 
cent aro in the public schools. Of the total number of graduates 77 per cent are 
in the public high schools, leaving about 23 per cent in the private high schools.

      Part 1 of the above diagram shows that over 12 per cent of the students reported in 
the public high schools are preparing for college, and they are almost equally divided 
between the classical and scientific courses. The larger percentage of students in 
the classical course in the public high schools is found in the North Atlantic, South 
Atlantic, and South Central Divisions, the largest proportion being in the South 
Central Division, while in the North Central and Western Divisions the numbers in 
the scientific course are almost double those in the classical course; that is, in pub- 
lic secondary schools the older-settled parts of the country show comparatively the

greater proportion of classical students and the newer portions the larger number 
in the scientific course. ; 
By examining Part 1 of the diagram it will be found that in the private acade- 
miex, seminaries, etc., over 25 per cent are preparing for college, nearly 16 per cent 
in the classical course, and over 9 per cent in the scientific course.

  In each of the geographical divisions the classical course has the larger per- 
centage of students in this class of schools. The largest proportion, nearly 20 per 
cent of the whole number, is found in the South Atlantic Division, the North Atlan- 
tic Division having 18 per cent, the South Central Division nearly 16 per cent, the 
Western Division nearly .13} per cent, and the North Central Division the lowest, 94 
percent. In the scientific course the South Central Division has the largest propor- 
tion, nearly 16 per cent of the whole number of students, the North Atlantic Division 
nearly 10 per cent, the Western Division over 10 per cent, the North Central Divi- 
sion 74 per cent, and the South Atlantic Division having the lowest proportion, a 
little more than 6 per cent. It will be noticed that in the South Central and West- 
ern Divisions the percentage of students in each course is about the same, that is, 
nearly 16 per cent in the South Central Division and nearly 11 per cent in the West- 
ern Division.
-P-A-G-E-63
SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 693 
An examination of the figures connected with this same diagram shows that of the 
25,286 students in the private schools, in both courses, preparing for college, 11,006, 
or over 43 per cent, are found in the North Atlantic Division, while of the 31,765 
students preparing for college in the public high schools in the country 15,460, or 
48% per cent, are inthe North Central Division alone, the North Atlantic States hay- 
ing the largest percentage of college preparatory students in the private academies 
and the Northwestern States the largest proportionate number in the public high 
schools. ° 
GRADUATES, 
Another interesting fact is the proportion of students in these schools who com- 
plete a certain prescribed course of study and graduate. This number includes a part of those preparing for college, and also quite a large proportion who do not pursue a higher course in college. 
The following diagram (3) gives the number of graduates in each class of schools, 
together with proportion of each to the whole number:

      In the year 1892 there were reported, as shown in the diagram, in the United 
States, a total number of 36,976 graduates, of whom 28,499, or 77.7 per cent, were 
from the public high schools, and 8,477, or 22.3 per cent, from the private acade- 
mies, ete. 
Of the 28,499 graduates from the public high schools 14,182, or a little over one- 
half, came from the North Central Division, while of the 8,477 graduates from the 
private institutions the North Atlantic Division furnished 4,237, or nearly one-half 
of the whole number. The proportion of graduates in each class of schools to the 
other, in the several divisions, varies considerably. In every division the public 
high schools have the larger percentage, the largest being nearly 88 per cent in the 
North Central Division, about 72 per cent in the North Atlantic Division, 68 per 
cent in the Western Division, and 53 per cent in both the South Central and South 
Atlantic Divisions. In the private academies, etc., the largest proportion, nearly © 
48 per cent, is found in the South Atlantic Division, and nearly the same in the 
South Central Division; about 32 per cent in the Western Division, 28 per cent in 
the North Atlantic Division, and the lowest, 12 per cent, in the North Central 
Division.  
-P-A-G-E-64
694 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
It is interesting to note, in this connection, the proportion of graduates to the total 
number of students in each class of schools in the different geographical divisions, 
and to exhibit this proportion the following diagram (4) has been prepared:

    The above diagram shows that the public high schools graduated nearly 11} per 
cent of the total number in attendance during the year, and the private academies 
nearly 8} per cent. In the North Atlantic Division the highest ratio of graduates is 
found in both the public high schools and in the private academies, the ratio being 
12.65 per cent in the public and 10.9 per cent in the private schools. 
Ths North Central Division graduated over 12 per cent of the attendance in tho 
public schools and over 8 per cent in the private schools, In the Western Division, 
over 11 per cent in the public schools and almost 10 per cent in the private schools 
graduated. In the South Central Division the percentage is 8.85 per cent in the 
public schools and 5. 43 in the private schools, while in the South Atlantic Division 
almost 8 per cent in the public schools graduated and over 54 per cent in the private 
academies. 
It is, of course, evident that these figures and percentages alone do not necessarily 
show the grade of the schools in the different sections of the country, because the 
standards required for graduation vary somewhat in the different classes of schools. 
If uniformity in courses of study should be adopted for secondary schools, then the 
percentage of students completing the course in any school or class of schools would 
become a more significant fact for comparison.

The above summary shows that in the public high schools there were 93,144 students in Latin, and of this number 43,830, or over 47 per cent, were in the North Central Division; 32,028, or over one-third, in the North Atlantic Division; 6,916 in the South Atlantic Division; 6,571 in the South Central Division; and 8,799 in the West- ern Divisio: Of the 7,397 in Greek, 4,968, or over two-thirds, were in the North Atlantic Division; 1,519 in the North Central Division, and but a small proportion 
inthe other three divisions. Of the 12,423 in French, the North Atlantic Division had 9,004, almost three-fourths of all, the North Central Division having 2,051. Of the 24,986 in German, one-half were in the North Central Division and 9,219 in the North

of whom nearly one-half wero in the North Central Division. In geometry and trig- 
onometry the numbers are much less, but tho larger proportion in geometry being 
in the North Central Division. ‘There were only 54,686 students in physics and 24,386 
in chomistry. In general history thero were 74,206 students, the larger number being 
in the North Central Division.

From this table it is seen that of the 38,892 students in Latin in the private acade- 
mies and seminaries, etc., 16,637 were in the North Atlantic Division, the South Atlan- 
tic Division having the next highest number, 7,414, the North Central Division having 
only a few less, and the South Central Division about 1,000 less. Of the 8,543 in 
Greek 4,917 were in thé North Atlantic Division. Of the 16,821 in French 9,607 were 
in the North Atlantic Division and 2,749 in the South Atlantic Division. Of the 
14,519 in German the North Atlantic Division had a little over one-half and the North 
Central Division 3,836. Of the 44,899 in algebra 16,497 were in the North Atlantic

Division, 10,004 in the South Central Division, and over 8,000 each in the South 
Atlantic and North Central divisions. In geometry the number is only 19,810, with 
a large proportion in the North Atlantic Division. In trigonometry the number of 
students was only 4,405, the South Central Division having the largest number, 1,353. 
The other studies are nearly in the same proportion among the geographical divisions. 
To show the relative importance of the studies pursued in these schools in the 
United States diagram 5 has been prepared. ‘This gives the number of students in 
each study and the percentage of these in each study to the whole number of stu- 
dents in each class of schools. The arrangement of the diagram is made so as to 
show the comparison between the public and private schools and indicates their 
relation to each other in each study,

. Itis interesting to note in the above diagram the large proportion of those study- 
ing Latin and that it is so nearly alike in both the public and private schools, being 
nearly 39 percent of the total number. Only 3 per cent of thosein the public schools 
study Greek, while in the private schools the proportion is nearly three times as 
great. Butalittle more than 5 per centstudy French in the public schools, while the 
private schools have threo times as many in the same study. The students of Ger- 
man in the public schools are about 104 per cent; in the private schools, 14 per cent. 
In algebra the public schools have nearly 49 per cent of all their students; the private 
schools, over 444 per cent. In geometry the proportions are 23.71 per cent in the 
publié schools and nearly 20 per cent in the private schools. Students of trigonom- 
etry are only a little more than 2} per cent in the public schools and 4} per cent in 
_the private schools. In physics the proportion is about 23 per cent in the public 
schools and 20 per cent in the private schools. In chemistry the number is about 
the same in each, nearly 10 per cent, and in general history the students in the pub- 
lic schools are about 31 per cent and in the private schools a trifle over 32 per cent. 
In order to show the status of secondary schools in regard to the number of stu- 
dents pursuing the principal studies in such schools, the following table (V) has 
been prepared, which gives the number and percentage of students in ten different 
studies, comparing public and private schools together. The table gives first the 
whole country, then by geographical divisions, and lastly the detailed figures and 
Bernat ger for each State and Territory, and in every case for each study sepa- 
rately. 
This table makes it possible to see at a glance the condition of the schools in any 
section or State in regard to any study or class of studies, as classics, modern lan- 
guages, mathematics, or physics, etc., and to see how the two classes of schools com- 
pare with each other in regard to studies, or rather in regard to the number pursuing 
certain studies.

German.—The proportion of students in German. varies greatly in different sec- 
tions of the country. Inthe North Atlantic Division, in the public schools, Con- 
necticut has the highest ratio, over 17 per cent, and New Hampshire the lowest, not 
quite one-half of L per cent. In the private schools New York has the greatest pro- 
portion, 26 per cent, and Maine the lowest, not quite 2 per cent. In the South 
Atlantic Division, in the publie schools, the District of Columbia has the highest 
ratio, over 27.5 per cent; while Delaware reports none, and North Carolina only a 
little over 1 per cent.. In the private schools Maryland has over 36.5 per cent, the 
highest ratio, and Georgia the lowest, not quite 1.5 percent. In the South Central 
Division, in the public. schools, Kentucky has the largest ratio, over I7 per cent, 
while Mississippi, Louisiana, and Indiau Territory report none, and Arkansas 2} 
per cent. In the private schools Tennessee: has the: highest ratio, over 14 per cent, 
and Mississippi the lowest, 1.75 per cent. In the North Central Division, in the 
public schools, Nebraska: has the highest ratio, over 22 per cent, and North Dakota 
the lowest, 2.25 per cent. In the private schools Wisconsin has the highest ratio, 
58.75 per cent, and North Dakota the lowest, about. 8.25 per cent. In the Western 
Division, in the public schools, Colorado has. the highest ratio, over 24 per cent; 
while Wyoming, Arizona, and Idaho report none, and New Mexico only 3} per cent. 
In the private schools: Oregon has the largest proportion, 23.2 per cent, and Wyo- 
ming, Arizona, and Idaho make no-report, while Montana has almost 5 per cent. 
Very interesting results can be found by going over the entire list of the studies of 
which the statistics and percentages are compiled in this table. The facts relating 
to the studies are given as indicating what a complete analysis of the table will 
show, and the table itself is so full and complete that it is not thought necessary to! 
go further into the details. 
PROPORTION AS TO SEX IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The question of the proportion of the sexes in the secondary schools becomes a 
matter of interest in comparing a series of years, so that changes, if any, ean be 
noted. For this reason the following Table vr has been prepared, giving as far as 
possible the number and percentage as'to sex of instructors.and students, inelud- 
ing the students preparing for college. There.is also given the percentage of each 
sex preparing for college to. the whole number in the school.

The foregoing table shows that of the instructors, 56% per cent in the public high 
schools and 52.75 per cent in the private academies, etc.,are women. Of the white 
students in the public schools 60 per cent are females, and in private academies, etc., 
not quite 48 per cent, the males having a majority in the private schools alone, Of the

colored students in the public schools, about 61.5 per cent are females, and.in the pri- 
vate academies, etc., the sexes differ less than 1 per cent. Of thestudents preparing 
for college in the classical course of the public high schools, the males are 54.5 per cent 
to 45.5 per cent females, while in the private academies, the males are 97 per cent, 
the females only 3 per cent. Of those in the scientific course preparing for college, 
in the public schools, the males are 49.5 per cent, the females 50.5, less than 1 per cent 
difference, while of those in the same course in the private academies, the males are 
73.5 per cent, and the females 26.5 per cent. Taking the preparatory students in 
both courses together, in the public high schools, the ratio is 52 per cent males to 
48 per cent females; in the private academies, it is 72 per cent males to almost 28 per 
cent females. The ratio of male students preparing for college in both courses to 
the whole number of male students in the schools is 17.3 in the public schools and 
34.75 per cent in the private academies; while the ratio of female preparatory stu- 
dents to the total number is, in the public schools, 10.7 per cent, and in the private 
academies, nearly 14.6 per cent. 
Another interesting fact in connection with sex is a comparison as to the ratio of 
each sex pursuing different studies in the schools. The following Table VII gives 
the percentage of male and female students for each of ten different studies in both 
classes of schools, by geographical divisions, the public and private schools being 
arranged together under each division, for easy comparison.

              On examination of the above table it will be seen that in the public high schools 
the females are over 60 per cent of the students pursuing all the ten studies named, 
except Greek and trigonometry, and a majority in Latin, French, German, algebra, 
geometry, trigonometry, physics, chemistry, and general history, thats in all the 
studies except Greek, in which the ratio is 624 per cent males to 37% per cent females. 
In trigonometry the females are 57 per cent. In the private academies, the males 
are a majority in Latin, Greek, German, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and chem- 
istry, the highest ratio being in Greek, nearly 85 per cent. The females have the 
larger percentage in French, physics, and general history, the highest ratio being 
in French, 63.75 per cent.
-P-A-G-E-79
SECONDARY SCHOOLS. ’ 709 
The various geographical divisions differ considerably in the relative percentages 
of the sexes pursuing certain studies. For instance, in the public high schools, of 
those studying Latin, the majority are females in every division; in the private 
academies, the males are a majority in every division except the South Central. Of 
the students in Greek, a very large percentage are males, in both classes of schools 
and in every division; while in French the opposite is true, the larger percentage 
being females in both classes in all divisions. In German, in the public high schools, 
the large proportion are males in every division except the South Central, and in 
that the two sexes are equal. In the private academies the males are the greater 
ratio in all divisions except the South Central and the Western divisions. Of the 
students in algebra in the public high schools, the greater proportion are females in 
all the divisions, the largest ratio, over 61 per cent being in the South Atlantic divi- 
sion; while in the private academies the males have the majority in every division 
except the South Central, and in that not quite 1 per cent less. In geometry, the 
females are the greater number in the public schools in all but the South Central 
division. In the private academies the males have a majority in all the divisions. 
In trigonometry the males predominate in the public schools only in the North 
Atlantic division and South Atlantic division; while in the private academies the 
males are the larger percentage in all divisions, being the greatest in the North Atlan- 
tic division, or 72 percent. In the public high schools, of students in physics, chem- 
istry, and general history, the greater ratio are males in all the divisions, while in 
the private academies, in physics, the females are the greater ratio in the South 
Central and Western divisions. In chemistry in the South Atlantic and South Cen- 
tral divisions, and in general history, the females have a greater percentage in all 
except the South Atlantic division.

CHAPTER XIX. 
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES, 
DISCUSSION OF STATISTICS. 
Number of wastitutions.—The number of universities and colleges reporting to 
this office during the year 1891-92’ was: 442, showing an increase of 12’ over the 
number reporting during the previous year. Prominent. among the new in- 
stitutions reported are the University of Arizona, at Tucson,. Ariz., andthe: Le- 
land Stanford Junior University, at Palo Alto, Cal. 
The University of Arizona was established by an act of the Territorial legis- 
lature in 1885, but owing to a lack of funds the institution was not opened to 
students until October 1, 1891. The act establishing the University of Arizona 
provides for the following departments: 
First. Yhe Department of Science, Literature, and the Arts. 
Second. The Department of Theory and Practice, and Elementary Instruction. 
Third. The Department.of Agriculture. 
Fourth., The Normal Department. 
Fifth. The Department of Mineralogy and the Schocl! of Mines. 
Only tiwo of these departments, the third and fifth, have thus far been opened. 
to students. This action was rendered necessary owing to the insufficiency of 
the income to equip and support all the departments. The resources of the in- 
stitution at present: consist of the $15,000 per annum for experiment. stations 
and of the appropriations by the act of August 30, 1890, to agricultural and me- 
chanical colleges. No funds from the act of July 2, 1862, are yet available. The 
university reported for its first year 9 professors and! 31 students. 
The Leland Stanford Junior University, at. Palo Alto, Cal., was determined 
upon by the Hon. Leland Stanford and Jane Lathrop Stanford in 188/.. Novem- 
ber 14, 1885, the grant of endowment was publicly made, and on the same day 
the board of trustees: held its first: meeting in San Franciseo. The work of con- 
struction was at once begun and the corner stone laid May 14, 1887. The uni- 
versity was formally opened to: students October 1, 189!. The property eon- 
veyed to the university consists:of the Palo Alto estate of 8,400 acres, the Vina 
estate of 55,000 acres, and the Gridley estate of 22,000 acres. The value of the 
endowment is generally estimated at about $25,000,000. The general manage- 
ment and control of the institution are vested in a board of 24 trustees, but the 
charter provides that the founders, during their lives, shall “perform all the 
duties. and exercise all the powers and privileges enjoined upon and vested in 
the trustees.” Tuition in all departments is free and board is furnished at cost. 
The number of professors and instructors during the first year was 38, while 
the students numbered 558, of which number 38 were graduate students. The 
university does not furnish preparatory instruction. 
Professors ond instructors.—The following table gives the number of profes- 
sors and. instructors, male and female, in tle several departments of universi-

The above table shows that of the total number of instructors reported, 1,270, 
or 13.6 per cent were women. Examining these figures by departments, we 
find that of the number of instructors in the preparatory departments, 28.8 
per cent were women, while in the college departments but 9.9 per cent were 
women. The smallest ratio of women instructors in college departments is 
found in the North Atlantic Division, where it is but 2.7 per cent.

partments for the year under consideration are given very fully according to

According to. these statistics, of the 9,254 students included, but 35.8 per eent 
were prepared: in public high schools. The showing made by the North Central 
Division inthis respect would seem to be very discouraging, considering the ef- 
forts of the State universitiesto bring themselvesintointimate relations with the 
high schools. The poor showing made by this division is explained, however, 
by the fact that reports on. this: point were not.made by the State universities of 
Michigan, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, andi Wisconsin, which are in close rela- 
tions with the public high schools of their respeetive States. 
HLquipment.—The following: table gives in a summarized form the number of 
scholarships, fellowships, and endowed professorships, the number of volumes. 
and pamphlets in the libraries, the value of the scientific apparatus and libraries, 
the value of grounds and buildings, and the total amount of productive funds, or 
endowment as it is frequently called:

An examination of these tables shows that the preparatory work done by these 
institutions is very little indeed, the number of students pursuing such work 
being but 15.9 per cent of the total number. Another noticeable feature is the 
large proportion of students pursuing courses of study leading to the degree of 
A.B. The number of such students is 1,293, or 66.4 per cent of the total num- 
ber in degree courses. The preparation of the freshmen of these schools forms 
another interesting item. While itis found thatin the colleges for males and 
in the coeducational colleges but 25.8 per cont of the students were prepared in 
public high schools, the foregoing table shows that 63.2 per cent of the fresh- 
men included in the table were preparcd in such schools. The institutions in 
this class ave fairly wellendowed, 81.1 per cent of the total amount of productive 
funds reported by colleges for women being reported by these few in stitutions. 
Division B.—The statistics relating to professors and students of the 144 col- 
leges for women of Division B are included in the following summarized table:

  As will be seen from this table, a comparatively largenumber of studentsare reported in the primary department. A large number of the institutions in- cluded in this division maintain courses of study from the kindergarten to the end of a college course, thus rendering necessary the maintaining of a large - number of classes. The proportion of students in courses of study leading to a degree is comparatively small, but the number of students pursuing studies in music andart is large. ; 
Some idea of the kind of instruction imparted by these institutions may be obtained from the following table, giving the number of students pursuing the different studies in 1891-92:

  Considering the nuinber of institutions concerned, the amounts of the items 
here given are very small. This is especially true of the amount of endowment 
funds, $717,132. This amount is found to be reported by twenty-five institutions, 
thus leaving one hundred and nineteen institutions without any endowment 
whatsoever. These institutions depend mainly for support on tuition fees and 
charges for board; 68.8 per cent of the total income for 1891-92 was derived 
from tuition fees. ‘The benefactions to this class of institutions are also very 
small, the total amount given in 1891-’92 being but $73,485. 
The number of degrees conferred by these institutions in 1891-92 is given in

CHAPTER XXI. 
THE PLACE OF UNIVERSITY EXTENSION IN AMERICAN 
EDUCATION. 
4 
[The following address, delivered by the Commissioner of Education at the First 
Annual Meeting of the National Conference on University Extension, held at Phila- 
delphia, December, 1891, discusses the significance of the new movement, and its 
bearings on the educational means and appliances now existing in the United States.] 
  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DELEGATES TO THE NATIONAL CONFER- 
ENCE ON UNIVERSITY EXTENSION: I have been requested to direct 
my remarks to the general bearings of the question of university 
extension. I shall therefore offer some considerations regarding the 
threefold structure of our edueational system into elementary, second- 
ary, and higher education, and discuss the general features which dis- 
tinguish each grade. I shall endeavor to show that higher education 
is the sanest and healthiest form of education, because it gives the 
student the means of correcting one-sided views. It gives him the 
method of study which compares one science with another and one 
brauch of learning with another, and always bears in mind the import- 
ant question: How does this element of knowledge relate tothe conduct 
of human life? From this point of view I shall explain why university 
extension seems to me to be one of the most important movements in 
our time. An exhibition of the fragmentary nature of elementary edu- 
cation and the necessity which has eaused this fragmentary character 
to adhere to it, will make it evident, I hope, that the directors of higher 
education have a sacred duty to perform in extending, by all legitimate 
means, the spirit of their methods into the studies which the adult 
population carry on by means of the newspaper, the periodical, and the 
book, throughout life. - 
Let me ask your attention, first, to the general aspects of our civil- 
ization. Let us consider the active means at work to produce cosmo- 
politan civilization and obliterate local and provincial peculiarities. 
The most striking characteristic of our modern civilization is that 
which has to do with the intercommunication of one people with 
another. The wonders of modern invention are to be found especially 
in this field of human activity. In the first place, the facilities for 
travel by land and by sea bring together a greater and greater number 
of people in each succeeding year. Think of the increase of the num-

and the humane, friendly interest of foreign people in this country form 
a perpetual educative influence, converting our people to cosmopolitan 
views and sympathies. But the educative influence of travel is small 
compared with that of intercommunication by means of letters and 
literature. In our time we have seen epic, dramatic, and lyric litera- 
ture retire into the background before the novel or romance as a lite- 
rary work of art. The novel has been called the prose epic, or the epic 
of commonplace, middle-class citizens. But the novel in our time has 
extended its gamut from the description of society manners and cus- 
toms and the petty events of courtship and marriage to the all-including 
scientific and historical movements which constitute the highest fields 
of intellectual labor. In the modern novel we have Shakespeare’s 
mirror, that is-held up to reflect society and the individual. We have 
the painting of the slums, the demi-monde, the processes of the schools, 
the Church; we have fully-colored pictures of ancient historic life, long 
buried, and brought to life only by the labors of archeology; we have 
a series of historical pictures, growing rapidly to a great gallery of 
paintings, illustrating medieval times, the beginnings of modern times, 
and, finally, the events of a century ago—Tolstoi’s Napoleonic wars, 
the Crimean war, Walter Scott's historical pictures; Victor Hugo, 
Thackeray, and a thousand writers less significant and still important. 
Each reading public learns to know the character and motives of its 
fellow-men in far-off countries or far-off epochs. Out of this comes the 
feeling of the solidarity of the human race. Every one feels that there 
is nothing human that he can consider to be entireiy strange to him. 
But even the novel is not to be compared, in its influence, with the 
daily newspaper and periodical press as an instrument invented by the 
human spirit to bring about the higher unity and synthesis of all peo- 
ples. Not only shall cach people combine in itself the best that has 
been realized by other peoples, but cach human individual shall take 
his morning survey of the daily movement of nations and colossal 
enterprises. 
Here is the significance of our new university extension movement, 
which we are here to-day to celebrate by this conference. University 
extension proposes to avail itself of the new inventions and instru- 
mentalities which have been developed in the interests of commerce 
and the ordinary interchange of opinion, and send the currents of higher 
thought, higher scholarship, and higher sentiment through these chan- 
nels, so as to directly influence all men. 
In brief, university extension proposes to itself to gain possession 
of the organs of publie opinion, and it is evident that this enterprise is 
one of the most important undertaken in our century since the estab- 
lishment of the common public school. 
In the most advanced civilization we find the completest system of 
means for the formation and promulgation of public opinion. All per- 
sons in the community, by means of the newspaper, look upon the 
same event, look upon the same sketch of public policy marked out by 
the statesman, listen to the same arguments, and take sides in view of 
the weight of argument. The public opinion thus organized is not the 
public opinion of a village or a province. Itis the public opinion of 
the whole country, and a public opinion which is formed, or secreted, 
so to speak, by the aggregate action of all the minds in the nation. In 
fact, this does not state it strongly enough. The public opinion of a 
newspaper-reading age is an international public opinion, a public 
opinion which takes into it as a determining element the views and 
opinions of other civilized nations. 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
PLACE OF UNIVERSITY EXTENSION IN AMERICAN EDUCATION. 745 
  But this kind of public opinion can not be found in an illiterate 
community, nor can the newspaper, which is the instrument for form- 
ing and disseminating such public opinion, penetrate an illiterate 
community. ss 
In old times, before the statesman could watch the verdict of public 
opinion on a proposed measure, he was perhaps obliged to take action. 
The diplomats found themselves obliged to plunge the nation into war. 
In our time, with the telegraph, and the newspaper, and a universal 
reading people, the dial of public opinion is visible to all statesmen 
and leaders of the people, and it is possible to avoid an appeal to the 
final court of arms. 
It is evident enough that the first requisite for the efficiency of these 
instrumentalities is a universal diffusion of common school education, 
and an ability on the part of all the people to read and understand the 
printed page. This is given inthecommon schools. The question arises 
at once, at this point: Why do not the common schools give an all- 
sufficient education? Why is not elementary education all that is 
desired among the people? Is it not true, that if the schools teach the 
people how to read, and the universal prevalence of periodicals and 
books furnishes what to read, that the life of the people is turned into 
a constant education? Will not such reading—such as the elementary 
school provides for—lead necessarily to the diffusion of all human 
learning? 
In order to answer this question properly, and to see the grounds 
which exist for the movement known as university extension, let us 
consider for 2 moment the difference between elementary school educa- 
tion and university education. The child who is of the proper age to 
learn how to read has not acquired an experience of life sufficient for 
him to understand very much of human nature. He has a quick grasp 
of isolated things and events, but he has very small power of synthesis. 
He can not combine things and events in his little mind so as to per- 
ceive processes and principles and laws—in short, he has little insight 
into the trend of human events or into logical conclusions which fol- 
Jow from convictions and principles. This is the characteristic of pri- 
mary or elementary instruction, that it must take the world of human 
learning in fragments and fail to see the intercommunication of things. 
The education in high schools and academies which we call secondary 
education begins to correct this inadequacy of elementary education; 
it begins to study processes; if begins to see how things and events 
are produced; it begins to study causes and productive forces. But 
secondary education fails, in a marked manner, to arrive at any com- 
plete and final standard for human conduct, or at any insight into a 
principle that can serve as a standard of measure. It is the glory of 
higher education that it lays chief stress on the comparative method of 
study; that it makes philosophy its leading discipline; thatit gives an 
ethical bent to all of its branches of study. Higher education seeks 
as its goal the unity of human learning. Each branch can be thor- ~ 
oughly understood only in the light of all other branches. The best 
definition of science is that itis the presentation of facts in such a 
system that each fact throws light upon all the others and is in turn 
illuminated by all the others. 
The youth of proper age to enter upon higher education has already 
experienced much of human life and has arrived at the point where he 
begins to feel the necessity for a regulative principle and guiding prin- 
ciple of his own with which he may decide the endless questions which 
press themselves upon him for settlement. Taking the youth at this

moment, when the appetite for principles is beginning to develop, the 
college gives him the benefit of the experience of the race. It shows him 
the verdict of the earliest and latest great thinkers on the trend of 
world history. It gathers into one focus the results of the vast labors 
in natural science, in history, in sociology, in philology, and political 
science in modern times. 
The person who has had merely an elementary schooling has laid 
stress on the mechanical means of culture—the arts of reading, writing, 
computing, and the like. He has trained his mind for the acquirement 
of isolated details; but he has not been disciplined in comparative 
study. He has not learned how to compare each fact with other facts, 
nor how to compare each science with other sciences. He has never 
inquired, what is the trend of this science? He has never inquired, 
what is the lesson of all human learning: as regards the conduct of 
life? We should say that he has never learned the difference between 
knowledge and wisdom, or, what is better, the method of converting 
knowledge into wisdom. The college has for its function the teaching 
of this great lesson—how to convert knowledge into wisdom, how to 
discern the bearing of all departments of knowledge upon each. 
It is evident that the individual who has received only an elementary 
education is at a great disadvantage as compared with the person who 
has received a higher education in the college or university, making 
all allowance for imperfecticns in existing institutions. Theindividual 
is prone to move on in the same direction, and in the same channel, 
which he has taken under the guidance of his teacher. Very few persons 
change their methods after leaving school. Itrequires somthing like a 
cataclysm to produce a change in method, All of the influences of the 
university, its distinguished professors, its ages. of reputation, the 
organization of the students and professors as a whole, these and 
like influences, combined with the isolation of the pupil from the strong 
tie of family and polite society, are able to effect this change in method 
when they work upon the mind of a youth for three or four years. 
The graduate of the college or university is, as a general thing, in 
possession of a new method of study and thinking. His attitude is a 
comparative one. Perhaps he does not carry this far enough to make 
it vital; perhaps he does not readjust all that he has before learned by 
this new method; but, placing him side by side with the graduate of 
the common school, we see readily the difference in types of educated 
mind. The mind trained according to elementary form is surprised and 
captivated by superficial combinations. It has no power of resistance 
against shallow critical views. It is swept away by specious arguments 
for reform, and it must be admitted that these agitators are the better 
minds, rather than the weaker ones, which elementary education sends 
forth. The duller minds do not ever go so far as to be interested in 
reforms or take a critical attitude toward what exists. 
The duller, commonplace intellect follows use and wont, and does 
not question the established order. The commonplace intellect has 
no adaptability, no power of readjustment in view of new cireum- 
stances. The disuse of hand labor and the adoption of machine labor, 
for instance, finds the common laborer unable to substitute brain labor 
for hand labor, and it leaves him in the path of poverty, wending his 
way to the almshouse. - 
The so-called self-educated man, of whom we are so proud in Amer- 
ica, is quite often one who has never advanced far beyond these ele- 
mentary methods. He has been warped out of his orbit by some 
shallow critical idea, which is not born of a comparison with each

department of human learning with all departments. He is necessarily 
one-sided and defective in his training. He is often a man of great 
accumulations of isolated scraps of information. His memory pouch is 
precociously developed. In German literature such a man is called a 
“Philistine.” He lays undue stress on some insignificant phase of 
human affairs. He advocates with great vigor the importance of some 
local center, some partial human interest, as the great center of all 
human life. He is like an astronomer who opposes the heliocentric 
theory and advocates the claims of some planet, or some satellite, as 
the center of the solar system. In sociology these self-made men advo- 
cate, for instance, as a universal panacea for poverty such devices 
as the abolishing of all individual property in land, or a single tax, or 
a scheme of state socialism; or, on the other hand, the equally negative 
system of laissez faire—let each look out for himself, and let the Gov- 
ernment forswear entirely all functions of nurture and provision for the 
common welfare. In the name of abstract justice, Mr. Herbert Spencer 
strikes at all of the concrete forms of governmnet in existence, and 
would fain cut them down to his procrustean standard, protecting free 
competition without provision for common welfare. 
There is a conspicuous lack of a knowledge of the history of the 
development of social institutions in all this. The individual has not 
learned the slow development of the ideas of private property in Roman 
history, and he does not see the real function of property in land. 
Again, he does not know the history of the development of human 
society. He has not studied the place of the village community and 
its form of socialism in the long road which the state has traveled in 
order to arrive at freedom for the individual. 
The self-educated man, full of the trend which the elementary school 
has given him, comes, perhaps, into the directorship over the entire 
education of a State. He signalizes his career by attacking the study 
of the classic languages, the study of logic and philosophy, the study 
of literature and the humanities. It is to be expected of him that he 
will prefer the dead results of education to an investigation of the total 
process of the evolution of human culture. The traditional course of 
study in the college takes the individual back to the Latin and Greek 
languages in order to give him a survey of the origins of his art and 
literature and science and jurisprudence. In the study of Greece and 
Rome he finds the embryology of modern civilization, and develops. 
in his mind a power of discrimination in regard to elements which enter 
the concrete life of the present age. It is not to be expected that the 
commonplace mind, which is armed and equipped only with the methods 
of elementary instruction, shall understand the importance of seeing 
every institution, every custom, every statute in the light of its evolu- 
tion. 
Again, the force of these facts is augmented when we consider the 
enormous development of secondary instruction in this country, not on 
the basis of the university, but on that of the elementary school. 
Within one generation the public free high schools have increased from 
a hundred or less to five or six thousand. For the most part the course 
of study in these institutions has been largely under the control of 
men educated only in elementary methods. As might have been 
expected, this fact has largely determined the character of the studies 
pursued in the high schools. Theclassic studies and pure mathematics 
have been discouraged, and studies substituted for them which have a 
real or supposed value in the business vocation. The consequence of 
this has been that the high schools of the country have failed to fur-

  748 ‘EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
nish men of real directive power. Their best representatives have 
been of the type of the self-educated men that I have just now des- 
eribed. 
While I consider it a matter of congratulation that the people of the 
country are fast establishing throughout the land a system of free edu- 
cation in high schools, yet I find myself obliged to admit that the 
present and past results of these schools may be summed up as the 
production of a vast intellectual current of Philistinism. There is not 
any argument for the importance of university extension which equals 
this in strength. The secondary education has largely been diverted 
from the road that leads to higher education, and turned aside in such 
a manner as to produce arrested development at the stadium of elemen- 
tary or secondary methods. The common schools of the people are 
suffering more from this cause than from all the other causes combined. 
It is a prolific source of mere mechanical device and methods which 
Jead nowhither. It produces a flippant, self-conceited frame of mind 
which does not hesitate to attack and tear down institutions which it 
fails to comprehend. University extension, as we understand it, pro- 
poses to close up this gap between higher institutions and the elemen- 
tary schools. = 
In recent years there has been a considerable elevation of the standard 
of admission to the college, and this has led to an increased develop- 
ment of secondary instruction, especially since the smaller colleges of 
the country have not been able to follow the lead of the great univer- 
sities without suffering in the size of their classes. The influence of 
secondary schools as directors of elementary common schools is not, 
and never has been, a healthy one. Only the college and university 
can give this healthy influence. 
With university extension the directors of higher education come 
at once into contact with the people. The university, through its prop- 
erly organized faculties, descends into the community and, as it were, 
takes an inventory of the bright and promising minds that are exer- 
cising an intellectual influence upon the direction of affairs. It gathers 
these into classes and audiences, and discusses with them the living 
questions of the day. It fascinates them with the superiority of the 
comparative method of study. It vanquishes the spirit of Philistin- 
ism and refutes the theories of cranks. 
This process of university extension, I need not add, has also a retro- 
active influence of great value upon the university itself. We all know 
how important is the present tendency toward specialization. We 
admit, nevertheless, that there is a danger in this, inasmuch as the 
specialist who does not use the highest or comparative method, and 
endeavors to bring his specialty into comparison with all branches of 
human knowledge—that this specialist, I say, tends to make his branch 
a hobby, and to set up his local center as the grand center of the uni- 
verse. Unbalanced specialism in education, therefore, tends to the very 
evils which clementary methods produce. But university extension 
will correct this. When the specialist finds himself face to face with 
an audience collected from people who have received only a common 
education, he ig forced at once into meeting their crude opinions by 
presenting the comparative history, of his theme, and by showing the 
bearing of other branches of human learning upon it. It is, as I 
have said, the characteristic of university extension that it finds its 
highest principle in the conduct of life, and that it is ethical in its 
method. The direct contact of university instructors with the people 
leads to the emphasis of the ethical standpoint.
-P-A-G-E-119

  So much for the reaction of university extension upon the university. 
itself. But I should not omit to say that the university extension 
movement will have another beneficial effect in increasing the number 
of persons who seek higher education. No sooner does the university 
enter the field of competition before the common people than it van- 
quishes the claimants for the cause of secondary education, and the 
claimants for the cause of elementary education as finalities. The peo- 
ple see at once the superiority of the higher education, and there arises 
throughout the community an aspiration for its advantages. Even the 
families of the poor will aspire each to educate one or more of their 
children for the university. We know that in former times, when the 
requirements for education had not climbed up to the place they now 
hold, how often ‘the poorest families in Scotland managed to educate 
one of the family for the university. The ideal of education, at that 
time, was university education. This desirable ideal will again prevail 
in the community, and where we have at the present in the United 
States only one in five hundred of the population enrolled in schools 
for higher instruction we shall have, as we ought to have, from five to 
ten times that ratio. 
Again, the advantage to the university will appear in the furnishing 
of direct practical careers to its graduates. In the laboratory and the 
seminarium the university trains its pupils to the work of original inves- 
tigation. It sends, therefore, into the community a class of people fully 
equipped with an intellectual apparatus for the correction and perfec- 
tion of the political and the» economical departments. It focuses a 
powerful light upon the directive power in the various departments 
of productive industry and local self-government. Now, university 
extension, by reason of the fact that it collects into organized bodies 
the most enterprising minds of the common people, prepares positions 
in advance for these graduates of the university. ‘They may take hold 
of the places where they are most needed without wasting their strength 
in endeavors to discover such opportunities, and to persuade men in 
power of the utility of their training for the work. 
We have seen how this movement arose in England. With the exten- 
sion of suffrage and with the increase of means of self-education among 
the people, and especially with the circulation of semi-scientific infor- 
mation by means of the printing press, there has been in the past a 
something of relaxation in the hold which the great universities had 
upon the people. This has been promoted by the self-educated man 
whom I have disparaged by calling him a Philistine. The great urban 
development of England, and, I may say, of all civilization, has pro- 
“duced in the community an aggregation of the weaklings of society— 
what we may call the population of the slums—a fearful problem for 
our civilization. It would have been the part of selfish wisdom to 
establish university extension in order to recover a hold upon the 
common people, and in order to grapple successfully with the social 
problem of the slum element which menaces the rule of law; but, strange 
to say, the university extension has not originated in the enlightened 
selfishness of the university, but rather in the pure missionary spirit, 
the spirit of divine charity which has always largely abounded among 
the directors of higher education. “There is no movement, however, 
which has worked for the perpetuation of the power of the upper 
classes, and especially of the university-educated classes of Great 
Britain, as has this movement of university extension. 
It is true that circumstances in this country differ from those in Eng- 
Jandin many particulars, but there are great broad lines of resemblance.
-P-A-G-E-120
    750 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
In both countries we have what is called local self-government. Eng- 
land is the nation in which local self-government has originated as a 
complemental element necessary to compensate for the one-sidedness 
of the Roman principle of centralization. In our Government, just as 
in the home government of England, there is arepresentation, not only 
of all individuals but of all interests, and this not only in the legisla- 
ture that makes the law, but in the courts which administer the law, 
and in the executive department which enforces the law. The making 
of laws is determined by the free process of elections and public debates 
in which all powers and interests struggle for the mastery. The decis- 
ions of the courts are determined by the same universal representation 
of individuals and interests; and, finally, the enforcement of the laws 
concedes the same rights of consideration for all parties concretely exist- 
ing in the community. It is evident that in England and in this coun- 
try—both democratic—there exists a sort of necessity for a free process 
of influence between the highest and lowest strata of society. In both 
countries demagogism increases in proportion to the neglect of the low- 
est stratum by the highest. This argument for university extension 
is so obvious that it does not need further expansion here. 
There is one incidental effect of university extension which I think 
worthy of special mention. The ordinary elementary school, second- 
ary school, or college seeks to give a general education to the pupil. 
It wishes to see everyone learn the conventional course of study, and 
net negiect either language, or science, or mathematics, or history. 
This curriculum, in a certain sense, mistreats those especially gifted 
individuals, found in all ranks, who have possibilities of the greatest 
usefulness in certain narrow lines of talent, but who are not attracted 
by other fields of knowledge outside of their specialty. Their love of 
one particular branch of human knowledge is so great that all other 
branches seem to them repugnant. These persons are the stuff out of 
which genius is made, but our traditional system of education has not 
known what to do with the candidates for genius. But the new meth- 
ods of specialization, which the university proper has taken up after 
the studies of college are completed, has opened up among our univer- 
sity educators an interest in special talent wherever it is found. Uni- 
versity extension provides new channels of communication between 
the directors of the university and these specially endowed people, 
scattered here and there throughout the community. The lecturers 
and class teachers of the extension movement are prepared to make 
an inventory, as it were, of. this very important, although not numer- 
ous, element in the population. This possibility of saving from waste 
some of the most gifted of people will occur to everyone as a strong 
reason for the existence of school and university extension. 
The old lyceum course did not provide for the active participation 
of the audience in the work of instruction. But university extension 
provides for discussions between the lecturer and his classes. It pro- 
vides for reviews, it provides for home studies and examinations. 
In regard to the question of management in this great movement, I 
suppose that we shall have a full discussion of the question of local 
centers versus one all-including society. Itseems to me that we should 
encourage local centers where there seems to be ambition and ability 
for successful organization. I think that this matter will take caré of 
itself. The advantages of a great central organization are advantages 
of finance. There is saved a multiplication of offices and a multiplica- 
tion of expense by cooperating in one great society. But where local
-P-A-G-E-121

reasons exist for independent societies, let them continue. Let any 
State whose government provides money to manage university exten- 
sion. within its boundaries go on and solve its own problems. There 
are lines of new experiments needed in order to discover the best instru- 
mentalities. The English have developed especially the lecture-course 
system, with its discussions and written examinations. In many parts 
of this country the system of home study and professional instruction 
by mail has been developed. There are very many other phases, such 
as, for example, that developed by the Brooklyn Institute, which ought 
to have full consideration. When we have developed a half-dozen types 
of university extension, each local center may adopt and combine three 
or four best adapted to it. In the meanwhile we must pay the well- 
deserved compliment to the American society, initiated by the Un1- 
versity of Pennsylvania, to say that it has made by far the largest step 
in making a useful and practical application of university extension 
in this country; and ali new movements in this direction should con- 
sider carefully the question whether something can not be gained by 
uniting with this great movement already so efficiently organized. 
Whatever may be the practical conclusion arrived at in regard to these 
matters of local and central administration, there certainly is but one 
possible conclusion as to the importance of a national conference with 
annual meetings for comparison of views. Each movement wishes to 
understand clearly the aggregate result of the experience of all move- 
ments. There should be a national conference, which brings out this 
experience in allits details, and serves it up for the instruction of all. 
I congratulate you, delegates, on your undertaking, which is, in 
the broadest sense of the term, a missionary movement. It is a move- 
ment which holds out the torch of the highest learning, not only for the 
illumination of all, but for the purpose of assisting each individual to 
light his own torch at its sacred flame. 
STATISTICS. 
in order to ascertain what degree of development university extension has attained 
in this country, a statistical investigation was recently made by the Bureau, the 
results of which are here given as an appendix to the foregoing address. 
The collection of statistics concerning university extension work is found to be a 
difficult matter, especially where the work is not conducted under the auspices of 
some educational institution. During the year 1891-92 reports were received from 
21 different institutions or societies who were engaged in this work. These agencies 
reported that there were delivered 319 courses of lectures, ranging in length from 1 
to 75 Iectures per course. The number of lectures in the several courses was as fol- 
lows: Four courses of 1 lecture; 3 of 2 lectures; 11 of 3 lectures; 2 of 4 lectures; 8 
of 5 lectures; 186 of 6 lectures; 6 of 7 lectures; 4 cf 8 lectures; 2 of 9 lectures; 20 
of 10 lectur 64 of 12 lectures; 1 of 13 lectures; 2 of 15 lectur es; 1 each of 20, 30, 
42, and 75 lectures; and 1 course in which the number of lectures was not repor ‘ted. 
These coufses were delivered in 159 different cities scattered throughout the country, 
from Maine to California and from Minnesota to Louisiana. The “aggregate average 
attendance on these courses was 47,613, with the attendance at 14 courses not given. 
The number of lectures by subjects was as follows: English literature, 69; Ameri- 
can literature, 5; German literature, 1; Scandinavian “literature, 2; politic al or 
social science, 41; poets or poetry, 20; prose, 2; modern novelists, 3; history, 58; 
government, 7; ev ‘olution, 2; eloc ution, 1; natural, physical, or mathematical science, 
85; Shakespes are, 11; psy chology, 5 5; ethics, 1; art, 1; F ‘rench drama, 1; Roman law, 
ie; ‘Roman antiquities, 1; English grammar, 1; subject not given, 1. 
Undoubtedly there ‘were delivered other courses of lectures of which this office has 
no information. Besides this work of university extension large opportunities for 
study by teachers and others are given by universities and colleges in what are known 
as summer schools, Through the agency of these schools the valuable libraries and

scientific apparatus of some of our higher institutions of learning are made available 
to students during the summer or regular vacation months. ‘The summer courses 
at Harvard University began in 1874 as a recognized part of university work; but 
they were then confined to scientific subjects. They have now been extended to the 
modern languages, elocution, history, pedagogy, socialism, and mathematics. The 
teachers in these courses at Harvard are, as a rule, the younger instructors and as- 
sistants of the university. The number of persons pursuing studies in the summer 
schools in 1892 was as follows: Harvard, 500; Cornell, 115; Indiana University, 90; 
University of Wisconsin, 189; Marietta College, 91. Other institutions providing 
summer courses, but not giving the number of students arc: University of California, 
Colorado College, University of Georgia, Cornell College, Amherst College, Western 
Michigan College, Hope College, Cotner University, University of Nebraska, Keuka 
College, Columbia College, Ohio University, Ohio Wesleyan University, Oberlin 
College, and University of Virginia. 
The summarized statistics concerning the courses of university extension lectures 
given during the year 1891-92 are presented in the following table. The detailed 
statistics are given in Part 11 of this ‘report.

  CHAPTER XXII 
THE RELATION OF THE INDEPENDENT COLLEGES TO THE 
SYSTEM OF STATE SCHOOLS. 
One of the best plans for the union of the separate colleges of a State into a 
State university is that proposed by Dr. S. S. Laws, formerly president of the 
University of the State of Missouri, and at present Perkins professor of Natural 
Science in connection with Revelation‘and Christian Apologetics, in the Pres- 
byterian Theological Seminary of Columbia, S.C. He proposes a federation, 
undef the leadership of the university, of the institutions of a State doing col- 
lege academic work providing for examinations that will entitle to the B. A. 
degree of the State university. Under such a plan as this, for example, the 
many excellent colleges scattered over the State of Ohio might be united under 
a federated board as the State University of Ohio,and agree upon a curriculum 
and upon examination papers that could be used in the several institutions 
simultaneously. The candidates who pass successfully the prescribed examin- 
tion would be entitled to the degree conferred by the State university. This 
plan of Dr. Laws seems to offer promise of fruitful results in the consolidation 
of the colleges of a State. It would increase the value of the degree without in 
any way encroaching 02 the local independence of the several institutions. 
This project was enunciated by Dr. Laws in the course of a discussion of a 
paper read before the Missouri State Teachers’ Association, Jefferson City, 
December 28, 1876, by President Morrison, of Drury College, Springfield, Mo., 
on ‘‘The relation of the independent college to the system of State schools.” 
Dr. Laws, being called on, responded by putting forward the following novel plan 
of State school federation: . 
‘““Mr. PRESIDENT: I wish tomake two remarks, and the first one has reference 
to the frequent allusions to the German University. I could name books that 
have been written by gentlemen from the German universities, which contain 
strictures and suggestions liable to mislead the public mind, and which, in fact, 
have misled it. I was seriously misled upon a particular point as to the rela- 
tion of the German to the American university. 
“The American university is not like the German university, and the exact 
point of difference is this: That in our American university the academic course 
is the nucleus around which all else clusters. It is the central point of devel- 
opment and of organization. But the German university has no undergraduate 
course. This course is taught in the gymnasium, and it would be necessary to 
take up the German gymnasium bodily and plant it down in the midst of aG 
man university to establish this vitil point of the analogy. 
“But this would explode the German system, as it now stands. 
“Bating some irregularities and exceptions, the German university matric- 
ulates only college graduates. Hence, the discipline of the members of the 
university community is that of professional schools with us. The gymnasia, 
which correspond to our colleges and to the academic departments of our uni- 
versities, have a discipline quite as rigid as the strictest of our undergraduate 
courses. The lectures so often given us respecting our university discipline 
are utterly impertinent, for a young man has to graduate at the gymnasium te- 
fore he is regularly admitted to the university in Germany. The faculty in 
philosophy in the German university does not do undergraduate but post-grad- 
uate work in the line of various specialties, and so of the other faculties. 
“Moreover, American boys, or men, carry away the degrees of German uni- 
versities upon other conditions than the native youth. The reason is that the 
ED 92——48 753 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
754 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
German universities are in the line of the civil service. For a native German 
to gain a position at the law, or in medicine, or as an ecclesiastic, his university 
degree is indispensable. But to our American youth the degree has no such 
use, and may mean almost nothing at all in Germany. 
“‘The gymnasium corresponds to our college or academic department, being 
perhaps more thorough in the classics but less complete than our best colleges 
in the sciences. 
‘‘The American University came originally from England. It is still tram- 
meled by some miserable monastic features of the Middle Ages, among which 
may be instanced the dormitory system. It is an unmitigated evil for the youth 
to be isolated from the domestic influences of the family circle during the form- 
ative period of college life. This antique patch upon our garments at the Uni- 
versity of Missouri I hope to see fall not only into discredit, but into entire 
desuetude. Ours is a humdrum American university, of which the academic 
department is crowned by the degree of Bachelor of Arts. There are other 
equivalent courses. And ihen we have the professional schools of normal in- 
struction, agriculture, law, and medicine; in fact, at present the institution coa- 
sists of a group of associated and cooperative academic and professional schools, 
each having its head-center. The classical curriculum has received various 
modifications in our American institutions, but nevertheless it runs through 
our educational system throughout the land like a golden thread. Our unique 
American university is, in my opinion, better for us than the German article. 
There is not now in the Missouri University any preparatory department.* The 
rabble that bore that name has been dispersed, and the work of the Englishand 
normal schools has been thereby relieved from incongruities. Preparatory or 
subfreshman work is done by e2ch academic school for itseif and in its own 
classes. 
“2. The second thing on my mind when I rose to speak, Mr. President, was 
the relation of the university to the various denomination:l or independentcol- 
leges of this State. There are only about eight or ten of them, and without 
exception they all are feeble and struggling for continued existence. 
‘About the time of returning to this State I met with one of the most dis- 
tinguished men of the East. In a conversation he said to me, ‘ Laws, one thing 
you will have to do is to kill off those little colleges and have one great institu- 
tion.’ I said, Mr. President, there are two very strongreasons in my mind why 
I should not commit myself to such a course of action. The first is, that these 
denominational colleges won't be killed off, and a man undertaking to engage 
in practical work must not disregard what is practicable. They have atenacity 
of life which aman who attempts to overthrow them will find, perhaps, is equal 
if not superior to his own. 
“The second reason that I gave him was, that they not only insist on living, 
but that they have a title to life which goes back to the very foundations of our 
American civilization ; from that time until now religious bodies havo acted a 
leading part in our work of edtcation. 
‘Tt is also true that these private schools are doing a good work, entitled to 
be recognized,and which, without their action, would be left undone. 
““With reference to our present posture at the Missouri University, I happen 
to know some things of value by an experience in this State in former years. I 
once felt the stinging of alash wielded by a vigorous hand in the position in 
which I now happen to be. I was sensitive, being connected with an independ- 
ent college, to anything that seemed to disparage the independent schools, and 
to claim for the university what I did not feel called upon to accord to it on the 
score of merit orof pretension. The idea has been more or less current hitherto 
that the private colleges are to be treated as inferier and tributary to the uni- 
versity. There is a serious errorcommitted at this point, which has ministered 
to ill feeling and confusion in the State of Missouri. 
“As I have just explained, in the Missouri University, as in most of our Amer- 
ican universities, the academic department is the nucleus, the fundamental 
part of the university. 
“Now, tike the academic part of the university and bring it into comparison 
with these private colleges and it ison a dead level with them. This assertion 
of superior claims over-them in the teaching of the academic curriculum is not 
weil founded, and is consequently offensive because unjust. The academic de- 
partment of the university is simply a college, and it has identically the same 
course of study that is pursued in these private colleges. Where is the superi- 
ority? It may be in pretension but not in fact, for the actual work done in cer- 
tain lines is done by some of them as well as it is done in the university college, 
and in some things perhaps better. The university and colleges should occupy 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  
  PLAN OF STATE SCHOOL FEDERATION. 755 
the same position of equality as coworkers in the same field, and engaged in 
the same general work, so that the academical department of the university 
should not pretend to superiority except so far as by common consent conceded. 
“What I have in mind, and will now express, is something to which Lask the 
attention of all co-workers in this State. 
“Why should not our academic faculty of the university and the academic fac- 
ulty of each of the denominational colleges throughout the State meet together 
on equal footing and effect a literary confederation? To take a single depart- 
ment cs a means of illustration: Let all the professors of mathematics consti- 
tute a board on the mathematical studies; let them determine upon their curric- 
ulum, having a margin of equivalence, so that a certain flexibility of coopera- 
tion would be practicable. There would then be a certain freedom exercised, 
on the part cf each professor, in leading classes over the work agreed upon in 
the mathematical course to be pursued in all our colleges. The other depart- 
ments could be arranged in exactly the same way. There is no need of repeti- 
tion, One department serves as an example for all. 
“ When the candidates for graduation of the several colleges are to pass their 
examination, let them go before a committee of examiners for each department, 
to be appointed by these boards, made up of the professors of the several de- 
partments. Let all of the candidates pass through the examination papers, so 
that their examination will be exactly the same; and then all thestudents from 
these institutions united in this literary confederation who pass the prescribed 
examinations will be graduated; and let this be the form, for example: A 
William Jewell College graduate of the University of the State of Missouri, 
or a Westminster College graduate of the University of the State of Missouri. 
And so of the others. There is nothing empirical in this. The only novelty is 
in the application of a tested principle. This is precisely what has been done 
in the universities of England for ages. Take Oxford,forexample. There are 
associated there over twenty different institutions, each having its separate 
organization, its own facu'ty, government, and tutorial arrangements. If a stu- 
dent has passed, and is successful in his examination, if from Baliol College he 
becomes a Baliol College graduate of the University ‘of Oxford. The graduate 
of the individual college thus becomes the graduate of the university. 
“Tt seems to me, therefore, that the acz ademic or collegiate department of the 
State University might be brought into cooperation with the private institu- 
tions, and these several institutions share in the influence and in the honors of 
the Central State University ; and then we would have what I would term the 
Missouri system. It would not be empirical, but in its principle rest upon the 
experience of ages. 
“We do not need or desire any legislation about it. It is aliterary confed- 
eration that is alone competent to meet the exigencies of the case. 
“In proposing and urging this scheme, we stand upon the just and proper 
ground that the Commonwealth of Missouri is utterly indifferent where the in- 
dividual is educated within the State, provided the education received isa good 
one, qualifying properly for the duties of citizenship. It is the province of the 
State, to provide the sort of education which her youth should have in the pres- 
entage, as fairly judged by the opportunities and responsibilities of the present 
and the future. And then, if the private colleges do not come up to this stand- 
ard, the university is open and ready to receive them. It seems to me that we 
have here the true principle upon which our whole educational work should be 
conducted. 
‘““There are several advantages which this literary confederation and co- 
operation, as explained, would bring to us. 
“First. It would establish a standard of education, so that those institutions 
that pretend to be colleges,and do not do college work, would at once lose caste 
and drop out of the misplaced confidence of the public. Let them pass our ex- 
amin:tions, or they will reveal their true character by,their fruits. It will give 
a distinct place to those institutions as doing secondary work, and it will stimu- 
late the real colleges to higher efforts. We. have, then, an organizing and sys- 
tematizing influence at once ficwing from such an arrangement. 
‘‘Second. This literary federation and cooperation will tend largely toincrease 
the spirit of education in the State. This is of primary importance; for if we 
can arouse the spirit of education, all will share in the shower. Were the pub- 
lic fully awakened on this supremely important subject, the existing educational 
appliancesin the State, run to their fullest capacity, would be inadequate. Our 
first interest is to bring more power into action through existing plants. 
“Tt seems to me, therefore, that by breaking down this indifference to the 
work of education it will be Strengthened in all its departments. i 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
756 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
‘*T feel an interest in this as a member of the State Teachers’ Association, and 
it seems to be something which we ought to attain. 
‘tT expect to take active steps to secure a convention of those connected with 
private colleges, that we may have a fair and full consultation over the general 
scheme now indicated. I now bespeak your favorable attention to it. 
“It is believed that cooperation and confederation can be attained ; and if we 
can attain it we have laid the foundation for a good work. 
“Third. It will notin the slightest unfavorably affect the patronage that these 
private institutions enjoy, but it will the more firmly fix them in the public con- 
fidence and improve their literary features. ‘They will still have the distinctive 
features belonging to them as the private colleges of different bodies. We 
weaken nothing ; we strengthen everything. Hence there is no good reason for 
isolation or opposition. If anyone does not wish to join with us, there is no quar- 
rel. Less than the whole can enter into this confederation to make trial of its 
virtues. 
“Fourth. It is another point of advantage that this arrangement seems to offer 
the encouragement and hope of a complete organization of our educational work 
in the State, for that organization will not be complete till the private and the 
public schools are all made interdependent and cooperative in some such way as 
that now indicated. 
“Every educational enterprise or organization, whether public or private, 
should realize that it is but a section of the great army battling for truth and 
light, and showing no quarter to ignorance, superstition, falsehood, and bad 
morals.” :

CHAPTER XXIII. ~ 
RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE. 
The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is located at Troy, N. Y. It was founded 
under the name of the Rensselaer School in the year 1824 by the Hon. Stephen 
Van Rensselaer, of Albany,N.Y. Inaletter dated November 25, 1824, to the Rev. 
Dr. Blatchford, who was the first president, the founder appointed the first 
board of trustees and enunciated certain articles for the temporary government 
of the school. At the same time he made Amos Eaton, of Troy, senior profes- 
sor. The first meeting of the board of trustees was held December 29, 1824, and 
the school was opened January 5, 1825. An act of incorporation was passed by 
the Legislature March 21, 1826. 
‘The institution was established as a school of practical science. In the letter 
referred to above the founder makes the following statement in relation to its 
character: 
“T have established a ‘¢chool in the north end of Troy for the purpose of in- 
structing persons who may choose to apply themselves in the application of 
science to the common purposes of life. My principal object is to qualify teach- 
ers for instructing sons and daughters of farmers ‘and mechanics, by lectures or 
otherwise, on the application of experimental chemistry, philosophy, and natural 
history to agriculture, domestic economy, the arts, and manufactures.” 
The intention of the authorities at that time is further shown by quotations 
from a circular dated September 14, 1826, which was signed by the president 
and to which the names of the trustees and faculty are attached. It was issued 
to describe an extension of the course, and is entitled -‘ Preparation branch re- 
cently established at Rensselaer School.” The curriculum of the ‘‘ preparation 
branch ’”is given in detail, and the object of the school is also stated. This is 
believed to be the first prospectus of a school of science ever issued in the Eng- 
lish language. From it we learn that ‘‘the Rensselaer School was founded by 
the Hon. Stephen Van Rensselaer, solely for the purpose of affording an oppor- 
tunity to the farmer, the mechanic, the clergyman, the lawyer, the physician, 
the merchant, and, in short, to the man of business or of leisure, of any calling 
whatever, to become practically scientific. Though the branches which are not 
taught here are held in high estimation, it is believed that a school attempting 
everything makes proficient in nothing. The Rensselaer School, therefore, is 
limited to an experimental course in the natural sciences. The studies of the 
preparation branch are extended no farther than is necessary, as auxiliaries to 
the experimental course.” 
‘“The original method of instruction which has produced such unexpected re- 
suits, called the Rensselaer method, will be extended to this branch, to-wit, that of 
exercising the student, on the forenoon of each day, by causing bim to give an 
extemporancous dissertation or lecture on the subject of his course, from concise 
written memoranda, and to spend the afternoon in scholastic amusements.” 
Among the subjects taught in the preparation branch were botany, practical 
mathematics, logic, rhetoric, and history, and the ‘*‘scholastic amusements” in- 
cluded the collection and preservation of minerals, plants,and insects, the use 
of the mieroscope, drawings of the internal structure of plants, making globes 
of plaster of Paris and drawing maps upon them, land surveying, taking the 
latitude, simple hydraulic experiments, experimenting with gases, makirg and 
using galvanic batteries and magnets, constructing and using thermometersand 
hygrometers, taking specitic gravities, ete. The circulars also contain, 
among other curious and interesting information, statements of the cost of tuition 
and of living. The success of the school in its early days was largely due to the 
remarkable powers as a teacher of its first senior professor, Amos Eaton. He 
introduced the methods of instruction outlined above, and many of his pupils who

institute. at the request of the Commissioner. 7

758 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  have since become eminent as scientific teachers and investigators bear testi- 
mony to the peculiar value of his teaching. He was not only successful asa 
teacher, but was well known as a popular scientific lecturer and as an investiga- 
tor. The various editions of his text buoks on botany, zoology, chemistry, 
geology, and surveying amount in all to about forty publications, 
In 1832 by anact of the legislature the name of the institutionawas changed 
from the Rensselaer School to the Rensselaer Institute, and by an act passed in 
1833 the trustees were empowered to establish a department of mathematical 
arts, for the purpose of giving instruction in engineering and technology. This 
meant the establishment of a course in civil engineering. Although the inclu- 
sion among the duties of the senior professor, in the first triennal catalogue pub- 
lished in 1828, of lectures on civil engineering is significant of the enlightened 
views of the founder and officers of instruction, the institution had been to this 
time a school of natural science, its graduates receiving the degree A. B. (r.s.). 
It is to be remembered that at, this time there were in this country hardly any 
engineers other than military engineers. The term civil engineer had scarcely 
been coined. The Erie Canal had only. been begun in 1817, and the first short 
piece of railroad was opened in 1830. 
Eight members of the class of 1835 were graduated as civil engineers and re- 
ceived the degree of C. E. This was the first class in civil engineering ever 
graduated in any English-speaking country. A circular entitled ‘* Notices of 
Rensselaer Institute,” and dated October 14, 1835, gives the curriculum for stu- 
dents of civil engineering as well as for those of naturalscience. Itis interesting, 
not only because it is the first prospectus of a school of engineering issued in 
English, but because it adds to our information of the state of applied science in 
this country at that date. Extracts from it given below show the courses in 
natural science and engineering: 
Students of the Natural Science Department are instructed as follows: 
Three weeks, wholly practical botany, with specimens, 
Four weeks, zodlogy, including organic remains, and physiology, including the elements of 
organie chemistry. 
Three and a half weeks, geology and mineralogy, with specimens. 4 
Three weeks, traveling between Connecticut River and Schoharie Kill, for making collections 
to be preserved by each student and exhibited at examinations; also for improving in the 
knowledge of natural history and mathematical arts. 
Ten weeks, chemistry and natural philosophy. 
Half a week, preparing for examination and commencement. ‘The afternoons of all fair days are devoted to surveying, engineering, and various mathe- 
apasiCar arts; also to mineralizing, botanizing, and to collecting and preserving subjects in 
zoology. Students of the engineer corps are instructed as follows: 
Eight weeks in learning the uses of instruments: as compass, chain, scale, protractor, di- 
viders, level, quadrant, sextant, barometer, hydrometer, pluviometer, thermometer, telescope, 
microscope, etc., With their applications to surveying, protracting, leveling, calculating exca- 
vations and embankments, taking heights and distances, specific gravity and weights of liquids, 
Gegrese of moisture, storms, temperature, latitude, and longitude by lunar observations and 
eclipses. 
Signi weeks, mechanical powers, circles, conic sections, construction of bridges, arches, piers, 
railroads, canals, running circles for railways, correcting the errors of long levels caused by 
refraction and the earth's convexity, calculating the height of the atmosphere by twilight and 
its whole weight on any given portion of the earth, its pressure on hills and in valleys as affect- 
ing the height for fixing the lower valve of a pump; in calculating the moon’s distance by its 
horizontal parallax, and the distance of planets by proportionals of cubes of times to squares 
of distances. 
Four weeks, in calculating the quantity of water per second, etc., supplied by streams as 
feeders for canals or for turning machinery; in calculating the velocity and quantity effused 
per second, etc., from flumes and various vessels, under various heads: the result of various 
accelerating and retarding forces of water flowing in open raceways and pipes of waterworks, 
and in numerous miscellaneous calculations respecting hydrostatics and hydrodynamics. 
Four weeks, study the effect of steam and inspect its various applications—inspect the prin- 
cipal mills, factories, and other machinery or works which come within the province of 
mathematical arts; also, study as much geology as may be required for judging of rocks and 
earth concerned in construction. 
The requirements for degrees were as follows: 
The Rensselaer degree of bachelor of natural science is conferred on all qualified persons 
of 17 years and upwards. 
The Rensselaer degree of civil engineer is conferred on candidates of 17 years and upwards 
who are qualified in that department 
One year is sufficient for obtaining the Rensselaer degree of bachelor of natural science or of 
civil engineer for a candidate who is well prepared to enter. Graduates of colleges may suc- 
ceed by close Seecea won. during the twenty-four weeks in the summer term. 
The degree of master of arts is conferred after two years of practical application. 
Prof. Amos Eaton died in 1842,and George H. Cook, of the class of 1839, who 
was afterwards widely known for his work as State geologist of New Jersey, 
was appointed senior professor in the same year. 
Under his direction the school was reorganized and the courses of instruction 
somewhat extended. He resigned in 1847, and was succeeded by B. Franklin 
   
-P-A-G-E-129

Greene; of the class of 1842, who became director of the institution when that 
office was created by act of legislature in 1850. 
His acceptance of the position marks an epoch in the history of the school. 
After a careful study of the scientific and technical institutions of Europe the’ 
curriculum was, under his direction, thoroughly reorganized in 1849, This re- 
organization included a material enlargement of the course of study and the re- 
quirement of a more rigid standard of scholarship from candidates for degrees. 
‘The number of instructors was also increased, and the length of time devoted to 
the course was changed to three years with a ‘“‘ preparatory class” which made 
it practically four years in duration. The graduating or senior class wascalled 
Division A, and the others Divisions B and C. in 1858 the preparatory class 
was merged into the regular course under the name of Division D. 
Prof.Greene published in 1856 a pamphlet of 84 pages entitled The Rensselaer 
Polytechnic Institute; Its Reorganization in 1849-50; Its Condition at the 
Present Time; Its Plans and Hopes for the Future. This, as its title indicates, 
was descriptive of the reorganization. The following paragraph from it shows 
clearly the character of the changes and the intentions of the authorities: 
‘““The managers of the institute therefore resolved that their field should Le 
narrowed and more thoroughly cultivated; that indeed their educational objects 
should be restricted to matters immediately cognate to architectures and en- 
gineering; that moreover, for a somewhat irregular and for the most part op- 
tional course, requiring but a single year for its accomplishment, they would 
substitute 2 carel lly considered curriculum, which should require at the least 
full three years of systematic and thorough training; and that, finally, they 
would demand the strictest examination tests to the successive parts of the 
course prescribed, not only in respect to the translation of students from lower 
to higher classes, but especially in all cases of ultimate graduation with pro- 
fessional degrees. 3 
It was at the time of this reorganization in 1849~’50 that the name Rensselaer 
Polytechnic Institute was first given to the school. This change ofname was 
ratified by act of legislature April 8, 1861. 
Thus was inaugurated the course and methods which have resulted in ziv- 
ing to the engineering profession in this and other countries during the last 
forty years many of its most distinguished members. The main causes of the 
reputation of the school and of the success of its graduates have been the method 
of instruction then adopted and the high standard of scholarship maintained 
Although the curriculum has of course since been changed from time to time 
to adapt it to the needs cf the best modern practice the methods have remained 
practically unchang<d. 
The classes are divided into small sections and each student is required to re- 
cite each day in every subject. Text-books supplemented by lectures andexpla- 
nations are used-whenever the nature of the case permits. The students are 
not only interrogated, but in almost all subjects are required to make black- 
board demonstrations. After the material constituting each term’s work has 
been finished a review in all subjects follows, and afterwards an examination. 
Close recordsof the work done each day are kept, and thesuccess of the student 
in passing in any subject depends largely upon these daily records. 
Director B. Franklin Greene resigned in 1859, and his position was occupied 
until 1860 by Nathan S, S. Beman, D. D., who was at that time president of the 
board of trustees.

760 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Requirements for admission.—The requirements for admission to the institute 
have been in the pastand are at present somewhat elementary in their character. 
In this as in some other respects it resembles the United States Military and 
Naval academies. The cause has been the necessity of thorough preparation 
in elementary branches of mathematics which experience has taught can not 
generally bo expected from students who have received their mithematical 
training in the secondary schools of the country. For this reason, besides the 
usual English branches, arithmetic, plain geometry, and algebra through quad- 
raticequations only are required foradmission. Local examinations for entrance 
are provided in a few schools of high grade in various parts of the country. 
Number and length of terms.—Each year is divided into two terms of about 
nineteen weeks each and examinations are held at the endof each term. Besides 
this, students of division C and B, which correspond to the sophomore and jun- 
ior years of academic schools, go into the field during the month of July for in- 
struction in practical surveying of various kinds. This is in addition to the 
surveying required during other parts of the course. 
Courses of instruction.—The principal course of instruction given is that of 
civil engineering, and the degree conferred is civil engineer (C. E.). It is 
to be distinctly understood, however, that the instruction is not narrowed to 
any special branch of civilengineering. The design of steam engines as wellas 
that of bridges, sewerage systems, waterworks, etc., is taught, and the student 
receives instruction as weil in the principles of electrical engineering as in the 
location and construction of roads and railroads. There is also given a course 
in natural science, upon the satisfactory completion ef which the degrce of 
bachelor of science (B.S.) is conferred. 
Special practical courses in chemistry and assaying and in surveying and rail- 
road engineering are given during the summer vacation. That in chemistry 
and assaying issix weeks in duration, and includes either qualitative or quanti- 
tative analysis 2s may be desired. The course in surveying and railroad engi- 
neering is given in the field between June 1 and July 1, and is therefore four 
weeks in duration. Some healthful partof the Adirondack region in the north- 
ern part of this State is chosenforthework. A special winter course of lectures 
on highway engineering and road construction isalso given. These lectures 
are not too technical in their character, being intended for those who, without 
an advanced special training, are engaged or interested in the construction and 
maintenance of country roads.

\ 
Mathematics and astronemy.—The aim of the departinent is to give each stu- 
denta thorough working knowledge of the several subjects taught. The courses 
are made to bear as directly as possible upon the training of the engineer. Dur- 
ing the first year thorough instruction is given in solid geometry, higher al- 
gebra, and trigonometry. These are followed by analytical geometry and differ- 
ential calculus inthesecond year,and by integral calculus inthe third. Lectures 
on the theory and various forms of the slide rule are also delivered. In all these 
subjects examples of a practical nature are constantly given. The text-books 
used are supplemented by notes prepared by the instructors. 
A course in descriptive astronomy is given in the third year, and that in 
spherical and practical astronomy in the fourth. In the latter are considered 
the adjustment and use of portable instruments, correction of observations, de- 
termination of time, latitude, longitude, and the meridian, the method of least 
squares and similar subjects. The theory is supplemented by work in the ob- 
servatory, where the use of the sextant, chronograph, transit instrument, ete., 
i ‘ht. 
     iptive geometry and stereotomy.—In this department careful and thorough: 
instruction is given in freehand drawing, lettering, the use of drawing instru- 
ments, tinting, shading, isometric and orthographic projections, tracing and 
making blue prints, the theory and practice of shades, shadows, and perspect- 
ive, machine construction and drawing, including gearing and the slide valve, 
and stonecutting. 
In all these subjects a great amount of time is spent in the drawing-room 
under the immediate supervision of the instructor, and original work sufficient 
to fix the principles is required. Indescriptive geometry, for instance, although 
a lesson is assigned for each day from the text-book the student is seldom given 
a problem found there, but is required to prove an original one illustrating the 
same principles. Besides the drawing required in the course in stonecutting, 
plaster of Paris models of arches, stairways, ctc., are constructed by the stu- 
dents. 
Chemistry.—The course in chemistry, which is obligatory for all students, con- 
sists of daily lectures, during the last part of the second year, upon general in- 
organic chemistry. These are accompanied by daily recitations, including the 
solution of chemical problems. 
The course in qualitative analysis extends over the first half of the third year, 
with laboratory work five days in each week. During this course the student 
acquires ability to analytically examine all the ordinary materials likely to be 
presented to his attention during his professional engineering practice. He is, 
as far as possible, given charge of outside questions which come to the labora- 
tory for solution. Blow-pipe analysis and assaying extend over part of the 
second term of the third year, particular attention being given to the assay of 
gold and silver and to the recognition of such ores of the heavy metals as may 
bo met with in the mining regions of this country. 
Quantitative analysis and organic chemistry are not given to candidates for 
the degree of civil engineer. Courses in these subjécts are given to candi- 
dates for the degree of bachelor of science, to post graduates, and to special 
students. Very complete arrangements make these courses especially thorough. 
Mineralogy, geology, and metallurgy.—These subjects are taught by means of 
lectures and recitations. An unusually fine collection of rocks, minerals, and 
designs for iron and steel works add greatly to the value of the courses.

  762 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Physics.—The course of physics begins in the last term of the first year with 
the mechanics of solids, liquids, and gases, and acoustics. Optics and heat are 
studied during the first term of the second year, and electricity and magnetism 
during the first term of the third year. These subjects are developed by daily 
lectures. The student uses a text-book, and is held strictly accountable for an 
exact knowledge of its contents, but much instruction is given additionally in 
the lectures, accompanied with full experimental illustrations. He is required 
to take notes during the course of the lectures and to copy others which have 
been put upon the blackboards. In the course of daily recitations problems are 
frequently assigned, and upon these as well as on demonstrations of theory the 
student is required to give both oral and writtenexplanations. During the first 
term of the second year a course of laboratory work is conducted in which the 
student is introduced to the methods of quantitative measurement, and he thus 
acquires some familiarity with the use of physical instruments. For each ex- 
ercice due preparation is made by appropriate reading, and a report is written 
which is examined by the instructor. During the first and second terms of the 
fourth yer laboratory practice is continued, prominence being given to methods 
in electrical and magnetic measurement. 
During the second term of the fourth year a course in thermo-dynamics is 
given and this is followed by lectures on the elements of electrical engineering 
as an accompaniment to the laboratory work in electrical measurement. 
Surveying.—The student begins the work in surveying during his first year 
atthe institute. In the second term of this year he is taught the use of the 
chain, tape, and compass. He also makes a compass survey of a small piece of 
land which is mapped and the area computed. 
In the second year the construction and use of all modern surveying instru- 
ments, including transit, level, solar compass and attachment, clinometer, hand 
level, aneroid barometer, planimeter, etc., are taught in the class room, as are 
also the various methods in modern use of making land, topographical, hydro- 
graphical, mine, and city surveys. In topographical surveying,whileall methods 
ere taughtand the conditions rendering one method more suitable than another, 
particular attention is paid to the transit and stadia, and the students become 
thoroughly familiar with this most generally suitable method. During the 
first term daily practice in the adjustment and use of the various instruments 
before enumerated is given. Surveys of limited extent are executed, a me- 
ridian is established with the solar compass, checked by stellar observations, 
and the magnetic declination of the needle determined. 
At the close of the year the class is taken into the field for four weeks, and 
makes a complete topographical survey of an area selected with reference to the 
diversity of problems it presents. This survey is also made to include hydro- 
graphic work, as the portion of the stream within the area chosen for work is 
mapped from soundings and its flow determined. 
Creodesy.—Besides the course in astronomy, in which the students are taught 
to determine latitude, longitude, time, etc., from observations on the heavenly 
bodies, a brief course in geodetic surveying is given in the third year. The 
work includes the methods of measuring base lines, field work of triangulation, 
adjustment of triangles and quadrilaterals and a discussion of the figure of the 
earth, 
Highway engineering.—During the third year there is given a course in high- 
way engineering, in which is discussed the location, construction, and mainte- 
nance of country roads and city streets, the advantages and disadvantages of the 
various paving materials and specifications for each, and a study is made of the 
various road laws in force and their adequacy. A special course of fifteen lec- 
tures on the construction and maintenance of country roads is offered to persons 
of mature years and is designed for road overseers and others having to do with 
this class of work. 
Railroad engineering.—The subject of railroad engineering is begun in the 
third year with a theoretical course in railroad curves, turnouts, and minor 
structures, and the staking out and computation of railway earthwork. The 
course also includes a discussion of the method of making railway location sur- 
veys, and a contour map isfurnished the student on which he projects alocation 
line and makes an estimate of materials and cost. This theoretical course is 
followed at the close of the year by four weeks of field practice in railroad sur- 
veying, during which a preliminary survey is made and mapped, a location pro- 
jected and run in, the work staked out, quantities computed, and cost estimated. 
A line from 8 to 8 miles in length is usually located, and through the courtesy 
of railroad officials interested in the institute, the classes not infrequently have
-P-A-G-E-133
    
RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE. 763 
an actually contemplated line to examine, which secures an interest and faith- 
fulness not always obtained on a mere ‘‘ practice” line. 
In the fourth year the subject generally known as Economic Theory of Rail- 
road Location, embracing the items of train resistance and the effect of grades, 
curves, and length of line on operation is thoroughly studied, together with the 
correlative subjects of economic construction, maintenance of way,etc. Numer- 
ous problems are given to illustrate the subject, and a short thesis, comparing 
two or more possible locations for a line, the data for which are given, is writ- 
ten. The students also discuss in the light of the new knowledge the location 
made the previous year. In addition to the above, there is given in the fourth 
year a comprehensive series of lectures on railway signals, embracing the con- 
struction and operation of block signals and interlocking signals for yards) 
crossings, etc. 
Summer courses.—It is believed that the summer courses in surveying in the 
second and third years are particularly valuable, on account of the continuous 
and practical character of the work. The student is employed all day for six 
days in the week, and the methods used both in the topographical and railroad 
surveys embody the latest modern practice. The work is usually located in the 
Adirondack foothills, and forms the most enjoyable and healthful as well as 
yaluable portion of the surveying instruction. These courses are open to a lim- 
ited number of special students who show themselves competent to perform the 
work, 
Topographical drawing.—Topographical drawing is taught in the first, second, 
and third years of the course. In the first year the student learns to make the 
various topographical symbols, both in pen and ink andincolor. Inthe second 
year,in connection with the course in surveying, he maps small areas from notes 
furnished him, measures and computes the areas and draws contours, projects 
grades, and computes volumes of earthwork involved in surface grading. He 
also makes a skeleton map of the summer survey. In the third year he com- 
pletes this map and also makes in the field the map of the railroad survey. The 
use of the planimeter and the various diagrams for estimating areas and earth- 
work are taught. 
{ Rational mechanics.—At the conclusion of the course in Integral Calculus dur- 
ing the first term of the third year instruction in Rational Mechanics begins. 
In this course, which extends over a part of two terms, with recitations and 
lectures every ‘day, the fundamental theoretic principles ‘of statics, cinematics 
and dynamics which underlie and form the foundation of all branches of engi- 
neering aretaught. The higher treatises and text books supplemented by notes 
aroused. The methodof instruction, which applies as well to the technical sub- 
jects in the department of me2 shanics as to the rational, is as follows: The class 
is divided into sections and each section, after a combined lecture and thorough 
interrogation by the professor in charge, goes to the assistant for a recitation 
on certain selected parts of the subject. The assistant requires each student 
each day to put one of these articles on the blackboard and explain it. During 
this explanation he is interrogated upon the principles involved. 
‘ Structures.—The theory of structures is taught during the last term of the 
thirdyear. This includes tho equilibrum and stability offrames, chords, arches, 
buttresses, chimneys, abutments, piers, retaining walls, dams, ete. Analytical 
and graphical methods of treatment are elaborated. A treatise on masonry con- 
struction is also used as a text-book, and the strength, properties, and cost of 
cement, mortar, concrete, brick, and stone masonry, together with all the more 
important kinds of foundations, are considered. 
| Resistance of materials.—The elasticity and resistance of the materials of en- 
gincering are considered during the first term of the fourth year. The funda- 
mental equations of the theory of flexure are first determined and applied to a 
consideration of the strength of simply supported and continuous beams and of 
columns. Practical formulz for the strength of beams are determined, and the 
right line long column formula and those of Gordon and Euler are deduced. 
Attention is also paid to the graphical representation of the strength of col- 
umns. Theoretical formule for torsion are developed and applied to a consid- 
eration of the strength of shafting. The design of riveted joi i 
and tube work is taken up and the proper size and pitch of rivets determined. 
| Inthe practical part of the subject the coefficient of elasticity, elastic limit, 
ultimate resistance, and other properties of cast and wrought iron, malleable-* 
ized iron, steel, bronze, copper, and other metals in tension, compression, and 
shear are studied, and the students are required to make experiments on the 
testing machine and determine their properties as above outlined. The value    
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  764 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
of wood, stone, brick, etc., for use as materials of engineering is investigated, 
and each student also determines the strength of cement by the use of acement- 
testing machine. Attention is paid to the fracture and appearance of metals, 
and also to the effect of repetition and reversal of stress. 
Bridges and rcofs.—The course on bridges and roofs is given in the first and 
second terms of the fourth year. The first part is devoted to the theory of 
stresses. In this the student becomes familiar with the calculation of stresses 
in plate girders, in Howe, Pratt, Whipple, and lattice bridges, and in trusses with 
curved chords; also i in cantilever, suspension, and draw bridges, and in various 
kind of roof trusses. Analytical and graphical methods and the method of wheel 
concentrations and of panel loads are used. Details and connections are care- 
fully considered and studied from the very large collection of blue prints of 
existing structures of all kinds in possession of the institute, A set of bridge 
specifications forms a part of the course upon which recitations are required, 
and hand-books of bridge and iron works are used for reference. During this 
course the class is taken out foran examination and comparison of various styles 
of bridges in the vicinity, anda bridge shop is also visited and the machines 
and methods of manufacture explained. 
The second part of the course in the second term is taken up with the dcsign 
of bridges and parts of bridges. The student makes all the calculations and 
complete shop drawings of the work in hand, each bridge being different from 
the others, and tracings and blue prints are finally made. It is thusseen that 
the course is thoroughly practical in its character. 
Hydraulics and hydraulic motors.—This subject is taught in the fourth year. 
It includes hydrology, hydrostatics, theoretical hydraulics, the flow of water 
through orifices, over weirs and dams, through tubes and pipes, and in con- 
duits, ‘canals, and rivers, the measurement and cost of water power, the dynamic 
pressure of flowing water, hydraulic motors, and the general principles of naval 
hydromechanics. Numerous examples illustrating the principles are given. 
In the direction of water-supply engineering there are considered general rain- 
fall statistics, precipitation, evaporation, the collection and storage of water, and 
its impurities; the practical construction of waterworks, including reservoir 
embankments, waste weirs, partition walls, conduits, distributing systems, and 
the various methodsof filtering. The delivery of water by pumpsis here touched 
upon, though this matter is more thoroughly treated in the course on the steam 
engine, The theory and efficiency of the various forms of water wheels are in- 
vestigated and the students are instructed with regard to the different kinds of 
turbines, with their draft tubes, diffusers, and governors. 
They are required to measure the flow of adjacent streams by means of weirs, 
and thus practically to find the discharge. Practicein the measurement of the 
velocity of streams by means of current motors and floats is also given, and 
models of valves, motors, practical working turbines, etc., add value to the in- 
struction. The subject of aérodynamics is also taken’ up in this course and the 
flow of air through orifices,and in pipes, blowing engines, the relations between 
the velocity and pressure of the wind, anemometers, windmills, etc., are studied. 
Sewerage systems.—The design of sewerage systems is taken up in the fourth 
year. A comparison of the cost and efficiency of the different systems is made 
and the conditions under which each should be used explained. The various 
methods of sewage disposal are exemplified and their efficiency discussed. The 
effect of the surface and magnitude of area drained in connection with the max- 
imum rainfall is considered, and main and branch sewers for the separate and 
combined systems are proportioned and their cost determined. The materials 
of construction, foundations required, methods of laying, and descriptions of 
details, such as *pranches, manholes, catch-basins, etc., are also given. 
Steam engineering. —The course in steam engineering is given during the last 
term of the fourth year. It consists of a series of lectures by a well-known con- 
sulting mechanical engineer. The properties of steam are firstelaborated, and 
afterwards the details and construction of the various engines and boilers in 
ordinary use considered. The strength of their parts are calculated and their 
general operation explained. The course also includes pumping machinery. 
‘The lectures are illustrated by drawings, photographs, and hand-books, and 
books of reference are used for consultation. Each student makes a general 
design for a locomotive, pumping, marine, or other form of engine, though de- 
‘tailed drawings are not expected. He is also required to take indicator dia- 
grams from some engine and determine from them its power. Examinations of 
various forms of steam engines in the vicinity are also made under the direction 
of the instructor.

A graduating thesis, which must be either a reviev: of, or a design for, a ma- 
chine, structure, plant, system, or process belonging to a department of scien- 
tific or practical technics is also required. 
Degrees conferved.—The annual register of the institute for 1893 contains the 
following clauses in relation to the conferring of degrees: 
The institute will confer the degree of civil engineer or of bachelor of science 
upon all its future graduates who shall have completed the course leading to 
such degrees, or to either of them.

bachelor of science. 
(2) His thesis must have been approved by the faculty. 
(3) He must have paid all dues to the institute. 
(4) He must be of good moral character. 
Buildings and property.—The institute has at present six buildings in use for 
purposes of instruction: the main building, the Winslow Laboratory, the Ran- 
ken House, the Astronomical Observatory, the Gymnasium, and the Alumni 
Building. 
The main building is 115 feet in length, 50 feet in breadth, and four stories in 
height. Itcontains lecture and recitation rooms, drawing rooms, and thelabora- 
tories of the Department of Physics. The main hall of the institution, where 
the reading of theses takes place, is also in this building. 
The Winslow Laboratory is 77 feet long, 45 feet wide, and three stories high. 
It is devoted to the Department of Chemistry. The first story contains rooms 
for quantitative analysis and special investigations, and also furnaces for the 
work in assaying. The second story contains the general laboratory for quali- 
tative analysis and rooms for chemical balances and for the instructor incharge. 
The third story contains the general lecture hall, a recitation room, a room for 
tho apparatus used in the lectures on general chemistry, and an office for the use 
of txe instructors in the department: In this room there is a carefully selected 
special chemical library. 
The William Proudfit Observatory is an astronomical observatory, consisting 
of a central part 40 feet square, with north, south, and east wings. It is 70 feet 
long and C0 feet in depth. It is well equipped with instruments for use in 
engineering instruction, containing a transit instrument, chromometer, chro- 
nograph, clocks, and sextant. 
The Ranken House is 40 feet square and two stories in height. It is used as 
amechanical laboratory, and contains machines for the testing of the various 
metals and of cement, stone, wood, ete. 
The Gymnasium is 80 feet wide and two stories high. The first story contains 
bowling alleys, sponge and shower baths, adressing room, and areceptionroom. 
The whole of the second story, 30 feet in height is taken up by the gymnasium 
proper, which has a gallery with a racing track and is fitted up with the best 
patterns of Dr. Sargent’s gymnastic apparatus. 
The Alumni Building is about 50 feet square and three stories in height. 
It is fireproof throughout, having concrete floors and brick partition walls. 
The first floor contains a library, a room for the trustees and the transaction of 
general executive business, and one for the office of the director. The second 
and third floors contain the geological, mineralogical, and general natural his- 
tory collections. There is alsoa lecture room for the professor of geology on 
the second floor. 
The Library.—The library, located on the first floor of the new fireproof 
Alumni Building, is strictly technical in its character. It consists of about 
5,000 volumes and a large number of pamphlets and maps, and consists of many 
valuable scientific works, including the publications of foreign and American 
societies, and bound volumes of various technical journals. The professional 
library of the late Alexander L. Holley was bequeathed by him to the institu- 
tion and forms a part of its collection. The books and pamphlets are accessi- 
ble to all members of the institute, and the reading room attached contains the 
current numbers of all the more valuable scientific publications of this and other 
countries. i 
Instruments and apparatus.—The institution possesses valuable collections of 
drawings, models, instruments, and machines for purposes of illustration and 
instruction in its various departments. The total value of its property is esti- 
mated at $350,000. -

    766 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Importance of the school.—The importance of this institution in the educational 
history of the country is well known. This is due not only to the methods of 
instruction and the high standard of scholarship required, but also to the splen- 
did work of its graduates as engineers and teachers of science. Ina pamphlet 
published in 1892, entitled, A Partial Record of the Work of Graduates of the 
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, are given the names of 33 presidents, 121 vice- 
presidents, managers, and: superintendents, and 69 chief engineers of railroad 
companies, steel and iron works, bridge companies, waterworks, electric com- 
panies, mining companies, sewerage systems, canals, etc., who have graduated 
at the school; also of 5 State geologists and 56 professors who have been con- 
nected with most of the great educational institutions of the country. 
The pamphlet also shows that the graduates of the school have been connected 
as designers and constructors with nearly all the larger bridge companies and 
great bridges in the country, and that they have in responsible positions helped 
to build and equip 109,000 miles of the railroad systems of North America, be- 
side many miles in other quarters of the globe. One hundred and ninety of the 
graduates of the school have become members of the American Society of Civil 
Engineers. It received atthe Paris Exposition of 1889 the only grand prize 
given to engineering schools of the United States. 
That it is widely known as a school of science may be inferred from the resi- 
dences of its students, who have come from all parts of the world. 
Number and distribution of graduates.—Including the class of 1893 there have 
been 1,093 graduates, of whom 837 are alive and 256 are dead; 947 received the 
degree of Civil Engineer (C. E.) The graduates are practicing their profession 
in 47 of the States and Territories of the United States, and in 18 foreign 
countries. 
Beside the General Alumni Association of the Institute there are associations 
of graduates in Pittsburg, Kansas City, Chicago, and New York. 
Instructors and students.—The Annual Register for 1893 contains the names of 
18 professors and instructors, $ lecturers and 206 students.

CHAPTER XXIV. 
THE UNITED STATES MILITARY ACADEMY AT WEST 
POINT.! 
  By Epwarp S. HOoLpEN, 
Director of the Lick Observatory, Mount Hamilton, Cal 
It is not long since we were reading in the newspapers daily telegrams from 
the seat of the Indian war in the Northwest. * * * In the midst of peace- 
fulsettlements a rebellion sprang up suddenly. Several thousand Indians left 
their reservations, benton war. Oursmalland scattered Army was called upon 
to suppress the rising, and ina few weeks this was accomplished. Thecountry 
isnow at peace. Tho Indiansare ruled justly, firmly, and honestly, by a couple 
of Army officers; in a few months we shall have forgotten the whole matter. As 
Tread the telegrams day by day it seemed to me that several important points 
were missed by the gentlemen who weresending them. Here wasarising which 
if anyway successful would cost hundreds of lives and millions of dollars. All 
the expense of life and money was sived by our little Army directed by a few 
competent officers. I have not seen it clearly brought out that the whole cost 
of our military establishment for along term of years would be a cheap price 
to pay for so prompt and ‘peaceful a solution. The confidence felt in our officers 
was an unconscious compliment to their efficiency, but it seemed that it would 
have been worth while to inquire a little more closely just why the confidence 
was felt, and just how they came to be efficient. Efficiency isnot a natural gift 
but is an acquired talent. In thinking of this petty war (which came very close 
to being serious), and in asking myself these very questions, I reviewed in my 
own mind the course of training at our National Military School and saw clearly 
how it is that our young men are taught to be prompt, efficient, faithful, and 
thorough. And I have thought that others might be interested in a sketch of 
the training of the cades at our War School, especially as it is not always 
understood. 
I shall speak of the effect of the methods adopted at West Point in developing 
moral character chiefly, and I shall be obliged to leave unexplained (for the sake 
of brevity) many points which might cause those unfamiliar with its work to 
think that the intellectual development of the student may suffer. That itdoes 
not so suffer it is perfectly easy to show, either by results (cee the table of civil 
occupations of graduates, following) or by argument. But it is clear that this 
latter question can not be thoroughly discrvssed here. I therefore beg my read- 
ers to take it for granted that along with the moral results which I shall exam- 
ine in detail, capital intellectual results are attained. These points should be 
constantly kept in mind in reading the present paper. 
The candidates to the Academy are appointed one from each Congressional 
district in the United States and ten ‘‘at large” by the President of the United 
States. Thus a full corps would now consist of about 350 members. This 
method of appointment secures an entirely representative body. The Ameri- 
ican people are exactly typified by the entering class of each year. The age of 
entrance must be between 17 and 22 years.

  7168 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
There is absolutely no selection on the part of the Government, except that 
the candidates should be physically sound and that they should be able to pass 
a simple examination in English, arithmetic, English grammar, geography, 
and American history only. Imagine, if you will, an entering class of say one 
hundred members, who come from every State in the Union, from Maine to 
Oregon and Louisiana; who have been educated at all kinds of schools, public 
and private; who represent all ciasses of society from the cultured to the igno- 
rant, from the very rich to the extremely poor, and whose homes may have 
been the simplest cottages or one of the brownstone palaces of New York or 
Boston. 
It is impossible to conceive a more motley assemblage as to their external 
looks and fashions. Intezriorly there is equal variety. Lads stand side by side 
who have had the most delicate moral nurture, or none at all; who are pure 
and simple, or already far on the road to dissipation; who are models of truth- 
fulness and modesty, or already shifty contrivers of escapes from duty and obli- 
gations. There is a representation of every possible class of American youth, 
and all the inequalities of our society are repeated here. I wish to insist upon 
this now, in order that the nature of the material may be thoroughly compre- 
hended, and in order that the result at the end of the four years may be ap- 
preciated. 
In afew days, the entrance examinations are over, and the class is reduced 
to fifty or sixty who are to begin their four years of probation. The external 
inequalities have all vanished as if by magic. Each cadet is dressed precisely 
like every other cadet; each has precisely the same duties as every other; 
each lives in a room precisely like every other room; no one is allowed to fur- 
nish his quarters in any but the prescribed way, with very plain materials made 
and issued at the Academy. No express parcels from wealthy homes may 
be received. No one is allowed to have money. At the best he can only 
have credit, on a pass book, and this credit can not be utilized without special 
permission. In a week every sign of external inequality has absolutely van- 
ished. It never returns so long as the cadet remains a cadet. After his grad- 
uation, wealth or social position may count. Until that time, no external cir- 
cumstances disturb the absolute personal equality of every member of each 
class. There are personal inequalities formed by the cadets themselves between 
class and class. 
Fach higher class maintains (and in general deserves to maintain) a superior 
standing to every lower one. Official inequalities are created by the appoint- 
ment of the best men of the second year to be corporals, cf the third year tobe 
sergeants, of the fourth year to be company officers—but these positions can be 
attained by good scholarship and by soldiery bearing, and in no other way. 
These rewards are open to all on absolutely equal terms. In the class-rooms 
the same equality cxists. The cadets are divided into small sections of eight 
or ten members for the purpose of instruction. Each section is presided over 
by some young officer of the Army, chosen for his ability. The professor in 
charge of a department visits all the sectionrooms frequently. Every twodays 
or oftener cach student recites in the presence of his professor. The most ac- 
curate record of the scholarly performance in the section-room is kept by the 
instructor and checked and verified by the professor, so that it is certain that 
the scale of marking is the same throughout the class. The lowest man in the 
first section is always a little better than the highest onc in the second. Abso- 
lute and complete justice is attained in this way more nearly than in any other 
organization it has ever been my fortune tosee and study. I have never heard 
it seriously questioned by student, officer, or professor. Once each week the 
marks of each cadet for every recitation are publicly posted. Thus every student 
can compare his work with that of every other member of his class. He knows 
from week to week exactly what he has been doing, and thus exactly what he 
must accomplish in the future to attain any given excellence. The sections con- 
sist of 8 to10 members. The recitations are from sixty to ninety minutes long. 
depending upon the topic in hand. Therefore each cadet is called upon every 
day, and the quality of his work is thoroughly tested. 
The certzinty that he must recite each day, and thatno failure can possibly be 
hidden, obliges each student to prepare his lessons with a thoroughness and 
faithfulness which is not attained at any other institution of learning with which . 
Tam acquainted. The effect on the moral character is immediate and admir- 
ble: The cadet learns in the recitation room, as everywhere else, not to shirk 
his duty, and he learns what few in civil life learn so carly, namely, that every 
sppnteming in the course of duty is sure to bring with it its corresponding 
penalty.

THE UNITED STATES MILITARY ACADEMY AT WEST POINT. 769 
A thoroughly unsatisfactory recitation not only receives a low ‘‘ mark,” but it 
is treated as a dereliction of duty also, and confinement to quarters during Sat- 
urday and Sunday afternoons is given as a punishment for such failures. Twice 
during each academic year there are public written and oral examinations in the 
presence of the whole faculty. 
A mark is assigned for the performance of the student at the examination 
also. Ifthe sum of all his marks in any study is above a certain quantity the 
cadet is proficient, and he receives a class rank in thatstudy depending upon his 
performance during the year, or it may be on his performance during a period 
of two years—for important subjects like mathematics are studied for the whole 
of two years. If on the other hand he is deficient, another cireful ex: mination 
under the eye of the whole faculty is given to him and the resultof this decides 
whether he shall he dropped altogether (and thus lose all hope of rank in the 
Army) or turned back to the class below his own (thus losing one year’s promo- 
tion). 
None whoare deficicntare permitted to goon with theirclasses. These severe 
penalties are constantiy before the eyes of every student. They are adminis- 
tered with perfect justice, and with inexorable certainty and with promptness. 
Afew weeks of inattention to duty will subject the careless student to them, and 
he knows precisely what the result of carelessness will be. Hence the idle, the 
careless, and the vicious are soon eliminated from the school; the others are 
brought forward to a high point of diligent and persevering attention to duty. 
Good intellectual performance is a duty. The Government is atconsiderable ex- 
pense in maintaining a cadetat the Academy. The plain question is, Isit worth 
while to be at this outlay for the promise and the performance of this particu- 
lar student?’ The daily test in the class rooms and the periodical examinations 
answer this question definitively. 
To complete the consideration of this part of my subject it is necessary tosay 
how the graduating class rank is obtained. The four or five highest of each 
graduating class are assigned to the Engineer Corps, the next to the artillery, 
the next to the cavalry and infantry. The desirability and precedence of the 
different arms of the service (with respect to their consideration, privileges, 
pay, etc.) isin this order. Moreover, the cadets are allowed to select the de- 
sirable regiments in exch branch of service according to their class rank. Pro- 
motion in one regiment may come several years before promotion in another, 
etc. Hence the graduating class rank is of immediate importance to the cadet. 
It is fixed as follows: From his record in each subject, as mathematics, physics, 
etc., arank in that subject is assigned to cach student. From the aggregate of 
all these special proficiencies a general proficiency is deduced. ‘This latter 
mark fixes the graduating classrank. Thus the difference between No. 5 and 
No. 6 in a class may have been decided by a week or even by asingle day of care- 
less work two, three, or four years before the time of graduation; and this dif- 
ference may make a marked change in the future of the young officer. Instead 
of important and responsible service in the Engineers, he may have slower pro- 
motion, less pay, and less desirable service in another arm of the service. This 
is perfectly recognized by all the students. They therefore recognize the per- 
fect justice of the final award. Little is said to them of the importance of their 
work in this respect. The natural effect of certain conduct is completely un- 
derstood by all, and it follows with a certainty and a justice which is practically 
perfect. It trains each student in the heathen virtues of fortitude and justice 
as no other system can. Itis the natural system—the system of nature—ulti- 
mated. 
I may now turn to the more strictly military education of the cadet, and here 
again we shall see the natural system of training in full operation. Here, asin 
the account of the mental work required of the students, I shall specially con- 
sider the effect of the system on the building up of a character and on the de- 
velopment of the simpler and sturdier moral virtues. 
A method which is so successful in training some of these, is applicable-to 
education in all the others. The conduct, the whole official conduct, of each 
cadet is the subject of record, just as his proficiency in a study like chemistry or 
tactics. 
  
1It appears to me that this aspect of school life should be placed frequently before students 
in our State colleges. It costs the State #400 to $500 per year for each student. The plain ques- 
tion to be answered for each individual student is, Is he worth $400 to the State, or is he likely 
tobe? If he is not, then his place should be filled by one who is. 
‘The vsual lax system encourages the student to consider the State as bound to take care of 
him, and tends to extinguish his manly independence. 
ED 92 49  
-P-A-G-E-140
  170 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. ° 
It is recognized that the official conduct required is necessarily difficult for 
the new comer to follow, and hence this record has no effect on his graduating 
rank until after the student has been six months in the Academy. Moreover, his 
conduct—discipline—in the last year of his course is counted twice as important 
as his conduct in any other year. 
This is es itshould be. To obtain a numerical standard of conduct, recourse 
is had to a system of demerit marks. Good, that is perfect conduct, is expected 
of all, and no credit is givenfor it. Any failure in conduct has a certain number 
of demerits attached to it. ‘‘Late at roll call” would carry 1 or 2 demerits; 
“absent,” 10; slight untidiness in dress, 1; inattention in ranks or in recitation, 
5, and so on. 
A cadet may obtain 125 demerit marks between June 1 and December 31 (a 
period which includes service in camp) and 90 between January 1 and May 31 (in 
barracks) without incurring any serious consequences. His class rank will be 
lowered just as if he had partially failed in a study like chemistry or physics, 
and he must suffer the confinements to quarters on Saturdays, etce., which are 
attached as punishments to certain offenses in addition to demerit; but his 
standing as a member of the school is only lowered, not endangered. If, how- 
ever, he has more ‘“‘ demerit” than these maxima, he is reported as deficient in 
conduct; hiscase is specially considered, and he is either suspended or dismissed. 
Let us see the process by which these marks are assigned. Any ‘‘ offense ”— 
as for example, ‘late at parade roll call’’—is noted by the proper officer (nearly 
always a cadet officer, not an officer of the Army) and is reported in writing to 
one of the army officers. The ‘‘offenses” for each day are posted onacertain 
bulletin board. An ‘‘explanation” in writing is required foreach offense. Not 
to render such an explanation is itself an offense. If there is no excuse, the 
* return to be made is: 
Offense: Late at parade roll call. Explanation: No sufficient excuse. 
(Signed) AuBis Cadet fourth class, D Company. 
Each cadet must therefore examine his official conscienc2, so tosay, regularly, 
and record the results of his examination. Ill feeling is avoided, as the whole 
transaction is carried on in writing, and there are no (or few) personal repri- 
mands. 
Let us now see how rigid a system this is. Take the one matter of tardiness. 
A cadet will attend the following roll calls daily: Reveillé roll call, breakfast 
(and formation after breakfast); class formation at 9 a. m. (and formation after 
this recitation); class formation at 11 a.m. (and formation after this recitation); 
dinner roll call (and formation after dinner); classformation at 2 p. m. (and 
formation after this recitation); drill roll call about 4 p. m.; parade roll call 
about 6 p.m.; supper roll call (and formation after supper). These are the regu- 
lar roll calls of every day during the month devoted to study. In camp life 
there are even more. There are fifteen opportunities daily to be ‘‘late.” By 
improving all these opportunities for six days (6X15=90) between January land 
May 31 the cadet would become deficient in conduct on account of tardiness 
alone. There are hundreds of other slight infractions of discipline, such as 
“one button of uniform coat unbuttoned at drill,” each of which carries with it 
at least one demerit. Ninety inallareallowed,andnomore. This limit passed, 
the cadet is deficient in conduct, and he knows it from the first. This limit ap- 
proached, and his promotion in the Army two, three, or four years from now 
will be to a lower corps instead of to a higher; toa less desirable station or 
regiment, instead of toa more desirable. This also is known from the first. 
There is no talking; simple laws are prescribed; it is not difficult to conform to 
most of them; every reasonable excuse is admitted; the result is like the result 
of gravitation—inevitable, inexorable, just, immediate. 
Observe what effect this constant responsibility must have. Take the case of 
punctuality alone. There are fifteen chances daily to be‘ late.” The cadet is 
at the Academy about forty-six months (two monthson leave of absence). Aver- 
aging the various duties, we may say that he is called upon to be prompt at roll 
call fifteen times a day for something like1,200 days; that is, the virtue of pune- 
tuality is insisted on in this particular way on 18,000 different occasions. In the 
same way ezch cadet is personally called upon to be neat, orderly, attentive, 
obedient, twenty, thirty, fifty thousand times during his student life. Andeach 
failure is noted. I have forgotten how many ‘‘ demerits” I personally received 
during my course (many more than I ought, no doubt), but I chance to recollect 
that I was not ‘‘late” for a single one of the 18,000 opportunities. It was a tra- 
dition in my time that Prof. A. D, Bache (2 graduate of the Academy atthe head 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
  THE UNITED STATES MILITARY ACADEMY AT WEST POINT. 771 
of his class, and the talented chief of the U. S.Coast Survey) had no demerits at 
all for his whole course. é 
Punctuality and promptness are insisted on in many other ways beside the 
one just cited. Order is enforced in the care of the arms, the clothes, the 
books, the quarters of the students. Obedience is the center of the whole 
system. Respect for superiors is natural to lads who are really in the daily 
presence of their superiors—koth their fellow-cadets and the Army officers. 
Real respect is the basis of modesty. With regard to their own powers 
and in relation to their fellow-members of the Army, the graduated cadets 
are modest and respectful not only in manner, but in reality. It is one of 
the minor deficiencies of their very special training, that they are allowed to 
remain too ignorant of the great world outside of their little one; so that we fre- 
quently see a spirit of arrogance toward this outside world growing up along- 
side of aspirit of real modesty to everything within their own smaller circle. 
I need not say that this is by no means necessarily so. It is the fault of the 
application of the system, not the fault of the system itself, and it can be easily 
corrected. Outward respect is taught in countless ways—by the required 
salutes of sentinels, ete. Perfect, simple, absolute truthfulness is taught also-in 
countless ways. Every written ‘‘explanation” must be perfectly true. Each 
cadet must always stand ready to explain his explanation in writing or other- 
wise. If he should descend to prevarication, he would be at once court-mar- 
tialed for ‘‘conduct unbecoming a cadet and a gentleman.” If he were found 
guilty he would be promptly dismissed the service. 
Moreover, the cadets have their own private Vehm-Gericht. If a comrade is 
known to be guilty of lies or theft, he is privately notified to tender his resigna- 
tion. Only the guilty will make such a sacrifice of their prospects and career; 
and this action on the part of the students has so far, I believe, produced only. 
good results. In my opinion, however, it is dangerous and unnecessary, and 
should be prohibited. 
Minor offenses against the unwritten law of the cadets are punished by refus- 
ing to have any but official relations with the offender. Occasionally this pun- 
ishment has been unjustly administered, but in general I have no doubt that 
good and not harm has resulted from this custom. It can not be and should not 
be touched by law, 
Ihave one more regulation and practice of the Academy to consider. I refer 
to the custom of requiring written reports from certain of the cadets after the 
completion of certain duties (as those of officer of the day, etc.). The cadet 
whose tour of duty has expired transfers his functions to his successor, and at 
once submits a written report regarding the matter in hand. This report con- 
cludes as follows: ‘‘I certify that the above report is correct and just.” The 
words, ‘‘on my honor as a cadet anda gentleman,” are always supposed to pre- 
cede the signature. I have neyer known such a report to be falsely signed. It 
is universally agreed among the cadets that they can not permit a comrade to 
violate his honor even to shield others from the severest punishments, still less to 
shield himself. A code of honor, highly artificial, if you choose, but highly effi- 
cient both in its outer effects and in its inner compulsions, is thus created, main- 
tained, and transmitted, among the students of this school. When they become 
officers, this code of honor becomes a code of honesty. 
I shall give some of the statistics of the Army considered in its relation tothe 
disbursement of public money, further on. It will be found that there is no or- 
ganization on earth, and that there never has been one, in which money has 
been handled so honestly as by the officers of the American Army. 
Any system can be judged by its average, or by its highest product. The 
highest intellectual productof the Military Academy is the Corpsof Engineers. 
Very few persons not graduates of the Academy have been members of this 
Corps. In general, it is recruited from the first five members of each successive 
class. 
To the Engineer Corpsis intrusted the expenditure of our largeappropriations 
‘for the improvement of rivers and herbors,” which often amount to fifteen to 
twenty millions of dollars annually. During the war of 1861-’65 they handled 
millions upon millions of public money. I believe that I am correct in saying 
that no single officer of this corps has ever been found guilty of embezzling the 
public money for his own use. 
The table which follows will give some idea of the intellectual results at- 
tained by the methods of the school:*

  Thave seena curious comparison by the late Gen. Alvord between the losses to 
the Government through the defalcations of Army officers (both graduates of the 
Academy and appointees from civil life) and lossesto the Bank of England 
through the defalcations of its employés. In both cases the loss wasa very small 
fraction of 1 per cent of the money handled, but the percentage lost through the 
unfaithfulness of our Army officers was only a small fraction of the loss through | 
the employds of the bank. I regret that I have not been able to find Gen. 
Alvord’s pamphlet, so as to quote his exact figures, but lam sure of the general 
conclusions. 
In comparing such statistics, it must be remembered that the officials of the 
Bank of England are a picked class, as well as the officers of the Army. The 
former are selected from the younger sons of wealthy families, and a clerkship 
isan honorable and well paid life career. Moreover, it must be remembered 
that during our civil war many appointments to places in the Pay, Quarter- 
master, and Commissary departments were hurriedly and ill advisedly made 
from civil life, and that the effect of the Military Academy training was chiefly 
felt by the checks placed by its methods over all officials, whether graduates or 
not. Even under the tremendous strain of the lat> war, the code of military 
honor and honesty showed itself to behighly effective. The total disbursements 
by Army officers during the war were over $1,100,000,000. The defalcations and 
money losses of all kinds (including captures of funds by the enemy, were less 
than $1,000,000, or less than one-tenth of 1 per cent on the money handled. No 
organization for the disbursement of public money, from the time the pyramids 
were built until now, hasa record approaching that of the disbursing officers 
of the United States Army. And this bright record is a direct result of the 
training of the Military Academy at West Point. 
We have justseen what the effectof the Academy training has been in matters 
relating to faithfulness and honesty in the care of public funds. It is more 
difficult to give statistical accounts of faithfulness in the performance of other 
duties. Perhaps [ may beallowed an illustration which seems to me to express, 
in brief, the whole spirit of the Academy. 
One of my close friends, a young engineer officer, was charged with the lon- 
gitude determinations along the northern boundary of the United States, be- 
tween Winnipeg and the Lake of the Woods. His work consisted in transport- 
ing a set of chronometers running on Greenwich time from station to station, 
and in determining at each place the local time by observation. A comparison 
of the local times with the chronometer times gave the longitudes from Green- 
wich. As the country near the Lake of the Woods is but a succession of 
morasses, this work had to be done in the depth of winter, when the marshes 
were frozen solidly. My friend, a lad cf 22 or so, had nearly completed all the 
links in his chain of stations, when he was caught with his entire party in ater- 
rific storm of wind and snow. For hours and hours the band, with the dog
-P-A-G-E-143

sledges, plodded on and on towards the station where their companions were 
feverishly awaiting them. To stop was death. One by one the men became 
exhausted and fell in the snow, begging to be allowed to sleep and to perish by 
freezing rather than togoonin the hopeless search forcamp. Thefewstronger 
ones (my friend among them) spent their forces in compelling the others to rise 
and struggle forward for their lives. The storm grew wilder and wilder, the 
night fell, and finally it seemed certain that the party was hopelessly lost and 
must perish. 
Even the dogs refused to gofarther. There was nothing left todo butlie down 
and die. My friend opened his note-book and with his freezing fingers wrote 
a farewell message to hisold father (himself a graduate of the Academy and a 
distinguished general officer), to his mother, to his sister. Then folding his 
cloak about him and commending his soul to God, this young hero laid down to 
sleep—the last of all his command—with the knowledge that sleep was certain 
death. He had done his duty. He could do no more. But yes—duty had 
another call. In the deadly stupor and chill of death it spoke to him, and the 
call was heard. As he told me, simply, not thinking it of great moment, ‘I 
remembered that the chronometers were not wound,” and that the longitude 
would thus be lost, for the party was sure to be sought for and found within a 
day. Once more he obeyed the call of duty. Once more he rose, struggled to 
the sledge, opened, wound, and carefully covered the chronometers, and once 
more laid down to die—this time in peace. All his duty was done. It was a 
deed of which humanity may be proud; donesimply, in solitude, manfully, faith- 
fully, to the utmost. After many hours the party was indeed found—and saved ; 
‘the longitude was not lost;” and the training of the school on the Hudson 
was displayed here, as it had been so often before, as it will be so many times 
again. 
“The Academy was founded in 1802: in the war of 1812-15 the young graduates 
took part. One-sixth of all who served in the field laid down their arms for 
their country: one-fourth of the total number were either killed or wounded; 
one-fifth of the survivors were specially:rewarded for conspicuous gallantry. 
In the Mexican war our armies were officered by graduates, and were opposed 
bya hostile force quadruple their own. Ina little over a year they had fought 
and won thirty battles, taken a thousand cannon, carried ten fortified places, 
and completed the conquest of Mexico and California. Gen. Scott has said 
(in a letter of June 21, 1860): ‘“‘I give it as my fixed opinion that, but for our 
graduated cadets, the war between the United States and Mexico might, and 
probably would, have lasted some four or five years, with, in its first half, more 
defeats than victories falling to our share; whereas, in less than two campaigns 
we conguered a great country and a peace, without the loss of a single battle or 
skirmish.” 
It is something to be able to do well what one sets out todo. Efficiency is a 
kind of virtue, and the record of these two wars sets a seal on the practical ef- 
ficiency of the graduated cadets. * * * 
Ihave thus traced rapidly a sketch of the national war school at West Point. 
I have shown how her sons arerecruited from every rank of life, and how various 
are their conditions. I have exhibited the training which they undergo, and 
have shown how it perfectly conforms to the method of nature itself. I have set 
forth, from statistics, the results of such training; and the record is one in 
which we as Americans may well be proud. No human organization has ever 
fulfilled its special functions more perfectly than our national Military Acad- 
emy. It will be immediately obvious why this is so, and I feel confident that no 
educator can read this sketch without finding in it lessons for himself to carry 
out in his own field of work. The results attained in our national school under 
highly specialized conditions can not be reached in degree, under the circum- 
stances of the common school. 
But the principles which stangd out are eternally applicable. Once compre- 
hended, they can be applied anywhere, under any circumstances. It would be 
unjust and ungracious in a son of the Academy to fail toname the man to whom 
above all others West Point owes its present system. 
Gen. Sylvanus Thayer was its superintendent for seventeen years, from 1817 
to 1833, and gave to it in his long administration essentially the form it now has. 
The principles of his government have been most faithfully and intelligently car- 
ried out by his successors in office and by the corps of professors and instructors. 
Public opinion among all the graduates is an immense force which tends to pre- 
serve and consolidate the main principles of the present system. There is no 
graduate of the Academy who would not make any sacrifice to preserve a sys-

  tem whose excellence has been proved to him in thousands of varying circum- 
stances. The principles which govern the administration of the Military Acad- 
emy are of the highest interest to those in charge of our common schools; but 
they are still more important, in my view, to the governors of our State univer- 
sities, especially when those universities have benefited by agrant of the public 
land and have engaged themselves to maintain a coliege where military subjects 
must be taught. Such universities are endowed by the United States for a spe- 
cial purpose, and they are in every way sacredly bound tocarry out their trust. 
It is impossible and undesirable to organize such military departments on the 
exact model of West Point. Their main object is not to make professional 
soldiers, but rather to train civil citizens who shall not be totally ignorant 
of arms, and who shall have the patriotic spirit as well as the technical ability 
to be useful to the nation in a time of trial. Such times of trial we have ex- 
perienced already, and we shall experience them again. It appears to me on 
every account important that this subject shall receive attention. And I know 
of no better way in which to inculcate thesimple virtues which are the basis of 
character than to encourage and foster these training schools especially en- 
dowed by Congress. The General Government, the State, the university, and 
the individual student will all be gainers—and that, in many different ways. If 
I have been able to show that there is a duty here, and that the means of per- 
forming it are simple and near at hand, I shall have done a public service. 
If I have further exhibited some of tho excellences of a Spartan system of 
training, which has triumphantly withstood the tests of three great wars, as 
well as the trials which come with peace, I shall be most glad to have returned 
thus much to my Alma Mater. 
It seems to me that [ understand, and that I must have made itclear, why it 
is that our little Army has never failed in any trial and why it never can failso 
long as the same wise counsels govern the war school at which our officers are 
trained; and it appears to me that the methods which have been successful there 
are, with suitable modifications, universally applicable and deserving of adop- 
tion throughout our whole public educational system—from the common school 
to the State-supported university.

  CHAPTER XXYV. 
THE CARE OF TRUANTS AND INCORRIGIBLES.! 
  
By Epwin P. SEAVER. 
Superintendent of Boston Schools. 
Boys who will not go to school when they ought, and boys who are so ill-be- 
haved when they do go that teachers have good reason to wish they had stayed 
away—these are the truants and incorrigibleswho must be taken care of if edu- 
cation in this country is to become universal in fact as well as in purpose, and 
so do its full work in-training to good citizenship, and in preventing crime. 
Little matters it whether the boy is out of school from his own waywardness, 
his parents’ neglect, or the willingness of teachers to be rid of a troublesome 
pupil; in any case he stands for a failure in cducation,and is a source of danger 
to the commonwealth. % 
How to care for such boys—and girls too, for there are such girls—now to 
keep them in a school where they must work steadily, behave well, and learn 
to cherish some worthy purpose in life—this we may call our truancy problem. 
Primarily the truancy problem is an educational problem for school authori: 
ties to deal with, not a matter of municipal regulation for police magistrates to 
manage. Not until truancy, neglected and: unchecked, has led to positivecrimo, 
ought the truant to be handed over tothe criminal jurisdiction. Not untiledu- 
cation has exhausted all means of preventionand reformation should the truant 
be surrendered to the police magistrates for punishment. 
The distinction here implied is of the greatest moment, though often ovor- 
lcoked or ignored. Let it be properly emphasized. 
Truancy is not in itself a crime; but itis the dangerous way that leads many 
a boy intocrime. The boy who has broken away from the restraints of home 
and school is not by that act a criminal; though he is giving rein to tendencies 
pnae will soon make him one. He is in grave danger; but timely care may save 
im. 
Now, if the truant is not a criminal, it is an injurious mistake to treat himas 
if he were; it is worse, it is a crime against society. Restraint he certainly 
needs; but the restraint of confinement in a prison, or eyen in a reformatory 
with criminal companionship, destroys at once the best chance there is of saving 
him from crime. for that best chance depends on keeping his self-respect un- 
impaired, which cannot be done if he becomes an inmate of a penal institution. 
Every inmate of such an institution well knows, whatever the cause of his com- 
mitment and however correcta life he may lead after release, he must ever 
afterward bear a certain stigma for having serveda sentence in a place setapart 
for the detention of criminals. «A hard and unjust fate this may be; but there 
is no help for it; it is the way the world has of leoking at such things, and the 
boy knows this just as well as we do. 
Therefore does the hope of saving the truant from a criminal career depend 
on his being kept as long as possible out of the criminal jurisdiction. His self- 
respect must be guarded and cherished as the very germ of that better life that 
’17The following valuable paper was read to the Department of Superintendence of the Na- 
tional Educational Association at its meeting in Richmond, Virginia, and at the request of the 
Commissioner of Education 2 copy was furnished for this report. ce

is to be awakened and strengthened in him. The place set apart for his detention, 
instruction, and discipline ought not to be the jail, the workhouse, or the reforma- 
tory; but it should bea separate establishment, wholly distinct and apart from penal 
institutions, and managed by the educational authorities of city, county, or State, 
not by the penal authorities. 
These remarks, and the conclusion drawn from them, seem fairly to sum up the 
teachings of experience in the administration of compulsory school-attendance 
laws in those parts of the country where such laws are enforced. A brief review 
of this experience may therefore be interesting. 
When really earnest efforts began to be made in Massachusetts to enforce the 
school-attendance laws it became necessary for towns and cities to provide places 
for the detention of truants. The places selected were generally unsuitable—in some 
cases extremely so. The prevailing idea among the officials seemed to be that the 
truant was a sort of malefactor, for whom any place of imprisonment was good enough. 
He was to be punished—that was the main thing—by being detained in a disagree- 
able place and compelled to do hard and disagreeable tasks, until he should be glad 
to pay for his liberty by going to school regularly; and his disagreeable experience 
should be a warning to other boys. Vindictive justice, not reformatory training, 
seemed to be the guiding principle. Accordingly truants were sent to the town 
almshouses, or to houses of correction, or to reform schools, or to any place where 
they could be kept from running away and forced to work. 
But in time there grew up among thoughtful people the opinion that such treat- 
ment of truants was not only ineffectual for the purpose intended, but positively 
injurious. The evil which should have been cured was only intensified. The 
remedy was worse than the disease. Frequent cases were cited which tended to 
prove that ill-managed truant schools—that is, truant prisons—were only primary 
schools of vice and crime. 
The late Henry F, Harrington, for many years the able superintendent of schools 
in New Bedford, eloquently protested in his official reports against the city alms- 
house being assigned as a place for the detention of truants in that city, and against 
the sort of care and training they received in that place. He declared with emphasis 
that by no official act of his would he become responsible for sending a single truant 
to that place. Not that the officers in charge were cruel or unfaithful; but they 
were much better fitted for their ordinary duties than they were for the delicate and 
difficult task of reforming wayward boys. 
But perhaps the most conspicuous example of this bad system of caring for 
truants was to be found in the so-called truant school at Boston. Happily this 
school is soon to be abolished; and in place of it a new school, to be organized 
and managed on a far better theory, is nearly ready to start. This will be known 
as the Parental School; and some notice will be taken of it in a later part of 
this paper. 
‘There is a large and once pleasant island in Boston Harbor, whose name, 
Deer Island, has acquired in recent years an unpleasant notoriety; for it has 
become in the popular mind a synonym for city prison. A broad expanse of 
water separates this island from other land in all directions save one; and here 
the tide runs through a deep channel with such force that attempts to escape 
by swimming are quite likely to end fatally. The great natural advantages of 
such an island as a site for the House of Correction, the House of Industry, and 
other such institutions were readily enough perceived by the city authorities. 
The impassable gulf of waters served the purpose and saved the cost of high 
prison walls. 
Here, too, naturally enough under the influence of ideas current forty years 
ago, was placed the House of Reformation for juvenile offenders, commonly 
knownas the reform school. This is the institution which has received all boys 
convicted of truancy in Boston down to the present time. For convenience of 
classification there has been maintained within the institution a certain distinc- 
tion between the truants and the other boys, the former being called the “ tru- 
ant school” and the latter the ‘reform school.” But both ‘schools ” are to allin- 
tents and purposes one and the same. The so-ealled truant school of Boston, 
therefore, has no real and separate existence, it is merely a department in the 
House of Reformation for Juvenile Offenders maintained for convenience of admin- 
istration. All this, however, is soon to be changed. The truants are to be cared for 
in some school wholly separate from the House of Reformation and situated at a 
distance from it and all similar institutions. 
The selection of Deer Island as a place for the detention of truants and juve- 
nile offenders was, as has been said, natural enough forty years ago. Little ac-
-P-A-G-E-147
THE CARE OF TRUANTS AND INCORRIGIBLES, T17 
  count was then taken of the effect of the criminal associations of the place upon 
the minds of the young candidates for reformation. The one thing certain was 
that the boys could not possibly escape from the island, as boys were constantly 
doing from other reform schools, giving the officers infinite trouble in recaptur- 
ing them. In those days the lesson had not been learned that right treatment 
of boys, even if they are ‘‘tough characters” and doers of criminal deeds, is 
more powerful to hold them in place than are bolts and bars and high walls. 
The reform school was formerly understood to be and practically was nothing 
more nor le:s than a boys’ prison. The only advantages it po.sessed over the 
common jail were these two: (1) The boys were instructed in school studies a 
part of every day; and (2) they were not exposed to the society of older and 
harder criminals. 
But modern experience has proved beyond a doubt that bolts and bars and 
high walls and prison-like discipline are wholly out of place and injurious in 
juvenile reformatories; and the same ought to be even more true of truant 
schools. The practical success of such reform schools as that at Plainfield, in 
Indiana, or that at Waukesha, in Wisconsin, or that at Lansing, in Michigan, 
or that near Providence, in Rhode Island, or that at Westboro, in Massachusetts 
(since its reorganization and removal to open premises), leaves no open ques- 
tion on this subject. We now know by practical demonstration that the best 
way to keep boys in a reform school is to» place no barriers in their way. Let 
them run away if they wish—sometimes they will run away, though not so fre- 
quently as under close confinement—but rely on right methods of treatment and 
discipline to hold them—not soft methods nor sentimental methods, butstrong, 
kind, and right methods. 
The unsuitableness of the House of Reformation on Deer Island as a place for 
the detention of truants has been strongly felt in Boston for many years. One 
manifestation of this is seen in the increasing unwillingness on the part of 
magistrates to send boys who are merely truants ‘‘ down to the island.” There 
has been a growing practice of putting complaints for truancy on file, in the 
hope the truant might see his dangerand mend his ways. But often the truancy 
complained of has beenaccompanied by criminal acts which make the case really 
more serious. In such cases the boy is usually ‘‘ sent down,” the complaint for 
truancy being resorted to merely as a means of giving him ashorter term in 
the House of Reformation than he would get under a criminal complaint. Soit 
has come to pass that the so-called truant school on Deer Island is hardly a 
truant school at all, but only a primary reform school. The consequence has 
been that truants have been allowed to ripen into juvenile criminals before they 
were taken hold of in real earnest. Measures to cure truancy in its early stages 
have been delayed until a worse disorder h:s made its appearance. 
Another strong reason for hesitating about sending a mere truant or compar- 
atively innocent juvenile offender down to the island has been the stigma 
thereby entailed, and the consequent lasting injury to the boy’sself-respect, Self- 
respect, as already pointed out, must be the main thing to rely upon in the work 
of reform. This stigma is all the more serious from the fact that the reputa- 
tion of having ‘‘ been down to the island” may mean that one has served time 
not mereiy in the ‘‘ truant school,” or in the ‘‘reform school,” but in the House 
of Correction or in the House of Industry. People do not stop to make distinc- 
_ tions. 
To show how cruelly this stigma may be used, let us take a case the like of 
which has happened more than once. A truant boy is sent down to the Island 
for a short term, we will suppose, and afterwards, having repented of his way- 
wardness, has grown up to be an honest, steady man. One day he iscalled into 
court as a witness and he gives his testimony. He is cross-examined, but is 
unshaken, becatse he has told the truth. In conclusion he is asked: ‘‘ Have you 
ever been convicted of crime?” ‘‘No,sir.” ‘‘Everserved time at Deer Island?” 
“Yes.” “That will do; you may step down.” It isof no use for him toexplain 
that he was at the Island a short time when a boy for truancy; the poisoned 
arrow has hit the mark; the jury’s mind has been prejudiced; and our grown-up 
truant boy feels that his early fault will never be forgotten. 
Realizing the evils growing out of the system that had been practiced in Bos- 
ton for many years the friends of a better system made repeated applications to 
the city government, and, failing there, to the State legislature for a complete 
separation of the so-called truant school from its connections and surroundings 
by the removal of itfrom Deer Island to some suitable place on the mainland. 
After some years of continued opposition from those who did not wish to have 
the existing system disturbed, a law was passed requiring the city of Boston to 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  (tack EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
do without further delay what had so long and so greatly needed to be done. 
Here is the first section of the law: 
“The city of Boston shall forthwith, upon being requested thereto by the 
School Committee of said city, establish on the mainland, atsome place removed 
from institutions occupied by criminals or vicious persons, a parental school 
for the confinement, disicipline, and instruction of minor children convicted ” 
(of truancy, etc.). 
This law was passed in 1886, but for nearly five years compliance with it was 
delayed, and annual attempts were made before the legislature to amend itina 
manner to deprive it of its original intent, so obstinate was the opposition of 
thoso who desired to save the old order of things unchanged. <A review of the 
long controversy would show how gradually the right principles of dealing w ith 
truants and with juvenile offenders becamo clearly established in the public 
mind. It was along ‘‘campaign of education.” 
Meanwhile, outside of Boston in the State of Massachusetts, the movement 
for better care and discipline of truants and incorrigibles had made itself felt. 
Some good county truant schools have been established lately, among the best 
being that for Worcester County. - To Hon. John W. Dickinson, secretary of the 
Massachusetts Board of Education, belong the credit of persistent effort and 
ultimate success in this movement in the State of Massachusetts at large. 
In other States, too, particularly in large cities, experience has been much 
the same as in Boston, and has led thoughtful people to adopt much the same 
views concerning the proper solution of the truancy problem. Evidence is 
abundant. Two short quotations must suffice. 
The first is from the reporto! a special committee to the city council of Cleve- 
land, Ohio, 1891. It gives the conclusions of the committee drawn from the facts 
and opinions submitted by many eminent and well informed citizens. 
‘In the judgment of the committee there isan imperative necessity of pro- 
viding some house, refuge or asylum for.the reception of the city’s waifs and 
youthful offenders who are not yet confirmed criminals. It seems equally clear 
that the needed institution ought to be wholly separated fiom the city work- 
house or any other penal institution. A careful investigation on the ground 
and collected information bearing on the subject clearly show that the State 
Industrial School at Lancaster is not well adapted to the necessities of the case, 
and it is incumbent on the city to make suitable provision for such necessities. 
* * Boys positively criminal should be sent to the State School at Lancas- 
fer, and not associated with the unfortunate or simply wayward boys, who should 
be cared for directly by the city. This matter of wholly separating criminals 
and noncriminals has received much study of late years, and the u: ne¢nivocal and 
almost unanimous verdict of the ablest penologists of this land and other lands 
is that such separation be rigidly maintained. The ‘segregate’ or ‘ cottage’ 
system, in which families of forty or fifty live by themselves in separate build- 
ings, seems preferable to the ‘congregate ’system, in which hundreds are housed 
together. It enables the classification of inmates to be made, and makes easier 
the work of ‘reformation in many ways.’” 
The second quotation is from a report to the Humane Society in Rochester, 
N.Y, E891. 
“The reestablishment of a truant house in Rochester is urgently needed. 
There are many children who refuse to go to school and over whom their par- 
ents have no sufficient control. Such children ought to ke brought up under 
kind but strict discipline. Butthere is no placefor them. They have commit- 
ted no crime and ought not to be placed in a penal institution. Then there are 
children whose parents serve a term in the penitentiary. The children have 
done no wrong, but they have teen surrounded by vice and have lived under the 
most corrupting influences, co that. they ought not to be brought into contact 
with other children until after a period of probation. For such as these a truant 
house would be a great blessing. Neither this, however, nor the temporary 
shelter of the Humane Scciety would receive children for whom a place is now 
provided elsewhere.” 
For further evidence we may turn to England. The truancy problem has re- 
ceived much attention of late in that country. There, as here, it has become 
evident that education to become universal and fully efficient must be both free 
and compulsory, and that the compulsory school-attendance laws must be faith- 
fully executed. Hence the need of truant schools. 
While the plans for the new parental schools were under consideration by the 
school committee of Boston a member of that body visiting England’ inspected

  THE CARE OF TRUANTS AND INCORRIGIBLES. 779 
some of the truant schools there and gathered valuable documentary informa- 
tion, which supports some of the views already expressed, and which was of use 
in shaping some features of the parental school in Boston. 
Truantschools in England are regarded as wholly distinct in purpose from the 
reformatories and from industrial schools. This distinction nas been recognized 
and acted upon since the year 1878, when the first truant school was established. 
There were, says Her Majesty’s inspector in his report for the year 1889, 10 
truant schools in the large towns of England. At the same time there were in 
Great Britain 56 reformatory schools, including 3 reformatory school ships; 142 
industrial schools, including 7 industrial school ships; and 18 day-industrial 
schoois. All the reformatories and most of the industrial schools owe their ex- 
istence to voluntary and independent efforts. School boards have the manage- 
ment Of all the truant schools, of all the day-industrial schools (save one in Liver- 
pool) and of eight of the industrial schools. The industrial school ship Shafts- 
bury is managed by the School Board for London; and this Board has also 
established two truant schools. : 
Formerly the practice was to commit truants, if bad enough, to the industrial 
school or the industrial school-ship. The present;truant schools, however, seem 
to answer the purpose of an earlier and more reasonable treatment of truants than 
the industrial schools could afford, for the inspector says: 
“Should the new act stop the commitment of truant children to industrial 
schools,a diminution in the number of the latter may be followed by an increase 
of truant schools.” 
Something of the character and purpose of the English truant schools may be 
gathered from the following language of the inspector: 
‘*To these schools are sent children who, after repeated warnings, have failed 
to make a satisfactory number of attendances at the ordinary day schools, in the 
hops that the strict corrective discipline which they are subjected to in them 
will make them less inclined to play truant when they are allowed to return to 
their homes. The terms of detention vary from a few weeks on the first com- 
mitment to a few months, if the first or subsequent commitments have not had 
the desired effect. The average length of detention is ninety-five days.” 
On the subject of discipline in these schools the inspector has some significant 
remarks, thus: 
‘Tn some of these scho>ls drill is substituted for play, and in some every boy 
has to undergo a limited period of solitary confinement in light cells. In some 
schools, which are managed on more kindly and, I think, more rational prin- 
ciples, there are no cells, and some play is permitted. I fail to see that the 
more strictly managed schools can show better results than the latter, and 
therefore I am entirely in favor of the second and more lenient system, and I 
would begin by abolishing cells altogether.” 
The ages of boys inthe English truantschools are about the same as we should 
expect to find in the United States, had we schools of a similar kind. Thus out 
of 1,532 boys admitted in one year there were: 
6to 8years of age - 8 to 10 years of age - 
10 to 12 years of age - 12 to 14 years of age - 
  A prominent feature in the English plan of dealing with truants is the condi- 
tional release from the truant school called a license. This is usually given 
after a few weeks’ detention. It puts the boy on probation, but keeps him still 
under the control of the truant schoolmaster, who may recall him at any time 
when he fails to deserve his liberty. The remarkableextent to which this prac- 
tice of ‘‘licensing out” is carried in England is shown by the following figures: 
Under detention in all truant schools December 31, 1889 --..--..------------- 3, 980 
In school .... Out on license 
Absconded -. 
  Thus it appears that for every boy in the truant school there were four more 
out on license and liable to be recalled for irregular attendance at the regular 
schools.
-P-A-G-E-150
    780 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
The extent to which boys are returned to the truant school two, three, or more 
times is indicated by the following figures: 
   
      ‘Total licensed and released in twelve years (1878-'89) - 10, 399 
Licensed and not readmitted _ 6, 198 
Licensed and once readmitted 2, 606 
Licensed and twice readmitted _ 1,017 
Licensed and three or more times readmitted : 
The inspector calls attention to the large number of readmissions, saying that 
the results of the truant schools ‘‘are not altogether satisfactory. ven the 
large number, 6,198, of boys ‘‘ licensed and not readmitted ” can not be taken as 
proving that three-fifths of the boys are cured of truancy by only one period of 
detention, because meny of these when first licensed must have been near the 
age of 14, ‘at which age absolute release tases place. These facts seem to show 
that the period of detention before the first release on license is generally too 
brief. It should probably be a few months rather thanafew weeks. Thus more 
time would be allowed for the firm establishment of right tendencies in the boy 
before trying him on license. With this improvement the English system of 
licensing out from truant schools would seem to be a good one for us to adopt. 
Upton House, a truant school under the control of the School Board for Lon- 
don, is thus described by Mr. Capen who visited it in 1891: 
“The plan adopted by the London School Board for dealing with truants isas 
follows: Boys are usally sent to the Upton House by the magistrates until they 
arrive at the age of 15 years, but in some cases for short periods only, as six, 
eight, twelve, or sixteen weeks. The usual course is to license the child out at 
the expiration of ten weeks, on condition that he attends a certified efficient 
school regularly. It then becomes the duty of the teacher of the school at which 
he attends to send a post card to the head offite on every Friday afternoon, giv- 
ing particulars of the boy’s attendance. If they are perfectly satisfactory for a 
period of nine months, application is made to the Home Secretary that the boy 
may be discharged. If, however, the teacher’s report shows that the boy has 
not attended regularly, an officer is at once sent to visit the boy’s home, and to 
warn the parents that if the boy does not attend with perfect regularity the 
license will be revoked. 
“In many cases this warning is all that is needed. But should the boy con- 
tinue to be irregular in his attendaace, his licens2 is revoked and he is taken 
back t> the truant school. On this occasion the period of detention extends 
to about three months, after which the boy is again licensed out. If this license 
is revoked a second time, his next period of detention is still longer. In ordin- 
ary cases there is no necessity for revocation of the license, but if, as occasion- 
ally happens, three or four revocations of the boy's license are ineffective, an 
application is made and proceedings are taken to have the boy sent to the 
ordinary industrial school, or what we call a house of reformation. 
‘The subsequent attendance of the boys who have undergone the discipline of 
Upton House shows the efficacy of the system to cure truancy. The average 
attendance of the boys licensed out for the last ten years except the year 1884, 
when the school was being rebuilt, is as follows:

THE CARE OF TRUANTS AND INCORRIGIBLES. 781 
  In conclusion shall be given, briefly stated, the points that were considered 
essential in the organization and management of the proposed Parental School 
in Boston, They are all implied in the idea suggested by its name. In a legal 
sense the school is to stand in loco parentis to the boy up to the age of 14 and give 
to him, as far as possible under the circumstances, a good home. 
i. The boys should be grouped in families of moderate size, age and moral 
condition being considered in the grouping. 
2. These families should dwell in separate cottages designed to accommodate 
twenty-five or at most thirty boys exch.* 
3. The family li‘e in these cottages should be in all its incidents as complete 
and homelike a3 possible. Meals should be taken in the cottage dining rooms, 
notin one large dining hall, even if that be the more economical plan. The 
civilizing process, which most of these boys greatly need, cn not go on in the 
large hall, but it can go on in the small cottage dining room.? 
4. Each cottage should be under the cave of a house master and house matron— 
pre‘erably a man end his wife—who should be to the boys as father and mother. 
A third adult, as a teacher or other officer of the school, should be lodged in 
each cottage and assigned some of the domestic cures. In emergencies the help 
of this third edult might be invaluable. 
5, All housework should be done by the boys under competent direction. 
There should be school instruction three hours a day. 
7. There should be moral and religious instructions on Sunday—a general serv- 
ice in one part of the day, morning or afternoon, and in the other part such 
separate denominational instruction as might be desirable. Ina sense moral 
instruction would be going on all the time, the whole discipline of the school 
being in fact directed to that end; but the Sunday instruction in morality would 
be of the kind usually associated with religious instruction. It would be the 
theory, of which week-day experiences would furnish the practical illustrations. 
8. There should be some good manual training; although in view of the rather 
short periods of detention and of the insufficient age and strength of many of 
the boys, such training could not be expected to reach very far into the learn- 
ing of trades. What has become known by the name of Sloyd is probably the 
best form of manual training for such boys as would come into the Parental 
School. Many a boy is a truant from sheer inability to grasp book studies. On 
the minds of such boys manual training often takes a strong hold. 
9. If there be land fitfor the purpose, instruction in gardening should be given. 
This does not mean that boys should be kept at work hoeing beans, weeding 
onions, picking berries, or digging potatoes merely to realize an income for the 
school. Such things they are to do, of course, but they are to be taught at the 
same time the principles and the art of gardening as if they were to become 
practical gardeners. It has been found difficult and well-nigh useless to interest 
city boys in country life and in farming. Nearly always after their release from 
reformatories or industrial schools, back they come tothe city. Therefore, gar- 
dening is the utmost that it is thought wise to attempt in this direction in the 
Boston Parental School. And the 30 acres of land this school is to occupy will 
afford good opportunities for horticultural instruction. 
10. Domestic service and instruction in other forms of labor should fill four 
hours a day. 
11. The study of lessons, the reading of books, the piay, the meals, and all 
other employments of the day which admit of it should be incidents of the family 
life in the cottages. Segregation, not congregation, should be the ruling prin- 
ciple in all arrangements for instruction and employment. : 
12. The buildings considered necessary are these: (1) A central building for 
the offices, superintendent's apartments, kitchen, laundry, bakery, and store 
rooms. (2) A schoolhouse and chapel, the class rooms being on the first floor 
and the chapel, large enough to hold the entire school, on the second floor. (3) 
Cottages neat and substantial, but not too costly, three or four to begin with, 
supposing the number of boys not likely to exceed a hundred for the first two _ 
or three years. 
13. The grounds should be inclosed with a fence or a wallof no more than the 
ordinary height. No provision against escapes is desirable. 
    
2 The writer regrets to say that in the new buildings constructed for the Parental School this 
limit has been raised to fifty boys. This is believed to be a serious error, not to be excused by 
considerations of economy. iS ‘ 
2This is another point upon which considerations of economy will be apt to outweigh moral 
and social reasons in the minds of average municipal legislators.

14, That the chicfly important thing in the whole business is to secure the 
appointment of a superintendent well qualified for the very peculiar and exact- 
ing duties of the position hardly needs to be said. And yetthe greatest danger 
of failure lies just at this point. Qualified men can be found; but appointing 
boards are not always qualified to find them, or appreciate them when found. 
15. But the greatest evil of all, and one to be guarded against at all points 
with the utmost care is the abuse of the pardoning power. Somewhere, of 
course, must be lodged the power of releasing the boy from further detention, 
either conditionally or absolutely.’ The danger that this power may be placed 
where it will be wrongly used can not but be obvious to all who are familiar with 
the character and workings of municipal governments in this country. The 
principle should be this: Release from the school always to be earned by good 
conduct, industry, and learning on the part of the boy while in the school, never 
by influence acting from outside. The importance of this principle can hardly 
be overestimated; and yet to secure a wise and steady course of action in accord- 
ance with it may become, under unfavorable conditions, an impossibility. 
16. What is known in penology as the indeterminate sentence should be ap- 
plied to all reformatories and truant schools, provided this can be done under 
conditions that will secure the right working of thatprinciple. The indetermi- 
nate sentence is a sentence which the convict may make as short as he chooses 
by reforming himself and proving that he has reformed himself by pursuing a 
steady course of right conduct for a sufficient length of time; in other words, 
by repenting and bringing forth fruits meetfor repentance. 
This principle would work admirably in a truant school, provided always it 
were rightly applied and not interfered with by irrelevant outside influences. 
Let the truant be brought into court at the earliest stage of the truancy habit. 
Let it not be a criminal court, but if possible the probate court or some court 
not ordinarily exercising criminal jurisdiction. Let the decree of this court 
place the truant school in loco parentis over the truant until he reaches the upper 
limit of age for compulsory school attendance, say 14 years. Such a boy might 
be 10, 9,or even 8 years old at commitment; butthe period of detention would de- 
pend on the boy, and might be shortened to a few months by industry and good 
conduct on the boy’s part. His first release should usually be conditional, so 
that the truant school could resume personal custody of him at any time if he 
failed to deserve his license. The chiefly important condition of his license 
would of course be regular attendance atsome designated day school. A weekly 
report of his attendance should be sent to his guardians at the truant school. 
The condition of the boy’s home and the disposition of his parents as to taking 
proper care of him are also important circumstances to take into consideration. 
Absolute release from the truant school would come in two ways; first, by 
the boy’s haying deserved it through good conduct while in the truant school 
and while out on license; and, secondly, by hisreaching the ageofl4years. The 
release coming in this latter way by limitation might or might not be deserved. 
If not the boy would probably soon behave in a way to deserve commitment to 
areformatory for older boys ona complaint before a criminal court. Still it 
would be true that the truant school had done all that was possible to be done 
for him. The younger the boy when first brought under discipline for truancy 
the greater the chance of a complete cure before the age of 14. The great and 
erying evil throughout the country to-day is that for want of proper means for 
dealing with truancy in its carlier stages it is neglected and ailowed to ripen 
into juvenile criminality and later into adult criminality.

  CHAPTER XXVI. 
COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES,! 
The policy of the coeducation of the sexes, which is widely extended 
in this country, becomes periodically the subject of special discussion 
and agitation. It was so a little more than two decades ago, when the 
demand for provision for the higher education of women had become 
general throughout the North and the Northwest sections. Unexpected 
resources for meeting this demand became available through the 
action of the Federal Government, appropriating (1862) about 10,000,000 
acres of land for the benefit of agricultural and other colleges. In 
the Northwestern States this land grant was regarded as a provision 
upon which women had the same claim as men, consequently the col- 
leges in that section which received the benefit of the grant were, as. 
arule, opened to both sexes. This action, and the influences that about 
the same time gave rise to colleges for women (Vassar, 1861; Welles- 
ley, 1870, and Smith, 1871), whose requirements were of the same order 
as those of the arts colleges for men, excited widespread interest and 
caused every phase of the problem of woman’s education to be earn- 
estly canvassed. The physiological and hygienic aspects of the prob- 
lem were at that time brought into special prominence by Dr. E. Clarke, 
of Boston. His work, Sex in Education, was virtually a protest against 
coeducation. The book carried great weight from its scientific tone, 
and its arguments are still the strongest that are adduced against the 
policy. Briefly summarized, Dr. Clarke’s argument appears to be that 
girls are naturally incapacitated for the sustained and regular work 
which boys bear without injury; consequently, the two should not be 
educated together.” 
‘Vigorous replies were immediately forthcoming. Especially notable 
among these were two books, Sex and Education and The Education 
of American Girls. The former comprised thirteen essays by well- 
known social and educational leaders, together with testimony from 
leading coeducation colleges, in support of their policy. _ in a contribu- 
tion to the book, Thomas Wentworth Higginson pointed out the chief 
weakness in Dr. Clarke’s argument, i. e., the want of a sufficient basis 
of facts.° 
At that time indeed no systematic effort had been made to collect 
and sift the facts as to the actual effects of coeducation in places where 
it was already practiced. The want has since been well supplied by the 
collection of vital statistics published by the Collegiate Alumne Associa- 
tion, and bya similar-collection in England—Health Statistics of Women 
Students at Cambridge and Oxford and of Their Sisters‘—due to the 
efforts of Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. The book entitled The Education of

  American Girls comprised also thirteen essays by women of large and 
varied interests, professional, public, and social, and was ably edited 
by Miss Anna C. Brackett. Against scientific theories these writers 
offered the results of extended observation and of actual experience in 
the acquisition and effects of mental discipline. These several works, 
and the opinions and discussions scattered through school reports of 
the period, are still the sources of the principal arguments advanced on 
either side whenever the subject of coeducation is reopened. 
Again, about 1880, the subject was widely discussed with special 
reference to the conduct of public high schools in the larger cities. To 
meet the demand which arose at that time for precise information on this 
phase of the problem, a special inquiry was instituted by the Burean 
of Education calling for the facts, and also for opinions of superin- 
tendents, with respect to the operations of mixed schools and classes. 
The results of this inquiry were embodied in Circular of Information, 
No. 2, 1883. f 
The past year has witnessed a great revival of interest in the subject, 
with a corresponding call upon this office for information relating 
thereto. As regards our own country, this interest is most active in 
the Southern States. It is there due in part to the development of 
high-grade public schools, and in part it arises from the recent efforts 
of young women to secure admission to Southern universities. Inqui- 
ries from that section relate not only to the fact of coeducation, but 
also to its economy and efficiency as compared with separate education, 
and, where higher institutions are concerned, to its effect upon scholastic 
standards, and upon the moral and physical well-being of students. 
Foreign countries, especially France and Germany, are largely rep- 
resented in the correspondence on this subject. It was a matter of 
constant inquiry on the part of the foreign delegates to the congresses 
of education held in connection with the Columbian Exposition, several 
of whom had, in fact, been specially commissioned by their govern- 
ments to investigate and report upon this feature of the American 
school policy. In view of these circumstances, it was deemed advisa- 
ble to issue a special inquiry in order that the present status and ten- 
dencies of our public-school systems in this matter might be fully dis- 
closed. Inquiries were accordingly addressed, one to superintendents 
of State and Territorial systems and a second to city superintendents. 
At the same time an analysis of the statistics of higher institutions, i. e., 
colleges and universities, was made in order to ascertain their position 
also in respect to coeducation. The results of these inquiries and 
investigations are here presented, together with citations from the 
literature which the subject has called forth during the periods of agi- 
tation above noted. 
I—STATUS OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITH RESPECT TO COEDUCATION. 
A. STATE SYSTEMS. 
The letters of inquiry addressed to State superintendents comprised 
the two following questions: 
(1) In what cities and towns of your State are the boys and girls 
taught in separate classes in the public schools? 
(2) In how many country public schools in your State are the boys 
and girls taught in separate classes? 
A request was also made for additional information or opinions bear- 
ing upon the subject. Replies received from forty States and four 
Territories! present the following particulars:

The replies above considered were generally limited to the statement 
of the facts and a strong indorsement of the policy of coeducation by 
the superintendents. 
The following citations present all the additional information offered 
by the State ofiicials: 
Hon. Edward Porter Thompson, State superintendent, Kentucky: 
The tendency now and for some years past has been towards coeducation of boys 
and girls in same school and same class. 
Hon. E. B. Prettyman, State superintendent, Maryland: 
Early in this century the general assembly established male academies if the 
counties, but the majority of these have been changed into high schools, teaching the 
sexes together. Washington College, at Chestertown, Kent. county, established in 
1782, and based on a flourishing academy which was established in 1723, for the first 
time adopted coeducation about three years ago, and in 1892 reported 90 male and 
20 female students. Dr. Reid, the president, informs me that the faculty and the 
board of visitors are entirely Satisfied with the change. The Maryland State Normal 
School, located in Baltimore, has had both male and female students in the same 
classes since its establishment in 1865. This arrangement continues to have the 
approval of the faculty and of the State board of education. 
Hon. J. R. Preston, State superintendent, Mississippi: 
Natchez, Vicksburg, Yazoo City, and Columbus are the only towns in which boys 
and girls are taught in separate classes in the public schools. Even in these towns 
the practice is disappearing, and mixed classes are taught in some of the depart- 
ments. 
Hon. Amado Chaves, superintendent of schools, New Mexico: 
In a year or two there will be no separate classes for boys and girls in this Terri- 
tory. Better results are obtained by teaching both boys and girls together. 
Hon. E. B. McElroy, State superintendent, Oregon: 
We have, likewise, coeducation of the sexes in special lines of State school work; 
108 example, in the State blind school and in the State school for deaf mutes the 
nora and girls are taught together and receive their instruction in the same classes 
m day to day.

Hon. C. W. Bean, State superintendent, Washington: 
There are a few schools for separate education of the sexes in this State, but they 
are under the control of churches. These supply the demand for such teaching, and 
under these circumstances the public sentimentin favor of coeducation in the public 
schools is very strong. Most of those who favor separate education do not appear 
as very strong advocates of a public-school system at all. 
B.—CITY SYSTEMS. 
The inquiry addressed to city superintendents sought not only to 
ascertain whether coeducation or separate education is the rule, but 
also the grades, if any, in which boys and girls are not taught in the 
same classes. From the summary of the replies of city superintend- 
ents given below it will be seen that in 586, or 93:3 per cent, of the 628 
cities represented boys and girls are educated together’ in all the 
grades.

COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 787 
  The cities included in the table in which coeducation is not universal 
may be considered either individually-or by groups. Of the 50 prin- 
cipal cities enumerated by the United States census of 1890, 40 are 
represented in the replies here considered.! In 27 of these boys and 
girls are educated together in all schools. In 4, Philadelphia, Pa.; 
Newark, N. J.; Providence, R. I.; Atlanta, Ga., the sexes are separated 
in the high schools only. In Providence this seems to be an outcome 
of the policy of elective courses 
Superintendent Tarbell says: 
The classical department of our high school teaches both sexes. The English 
department teaches a portion of girls separately, 413 in number. The manual train- 
ing high school teaches boys only, 150 in number. 
Hon. Thomas R. Stockwell, the State commissioner of public schools, 
also says: 
In the Providence high school there was originally a department for girls alone, 
but for several years the girls who were fitting for college have been taught i in the 
same classes with the boys, and now girls are admitted into the new manual high 
school and several of the classes in the girls’ department have been united with 
classes in the same subjects in the boys’ English and scientific department. 
I consider the change of policy here in Providence very suggestive, for the plan of 
separate schools for boys and girls in the high school has existed’ ever since the 
school was started, and has been most ardently advoeated by some of those most 
interested in the schools. I think it shows that coeducation is being more and more 
recognized as the proper method in all grades.   
  In Newark, in former years, there were separate classes for boys and 
girls in some of the grammar schools in the upper grades, i. e., seventh 
and cighth years. These have been abolished, but the separation is 
maintained in the high school. In 2 of the 50 principal cities, San Fran- 
cisco, Cal., and Wilmington, Del., boys and girls are separated in all 
grades above the primary. In 6 cities, New York and Brooklyn, N. Y.; 
Boston, Mass.; Baltimore, Md.; ; Washington, D. C.; Louisville, Ky., 
separate and mixed classes are found in all grades. This is a matter 
of policy in some instances, of circumstances, i. e., location, original 
arrangements, et¢., in others, as appears from the following statements 
by the superintendents of the respective cities: 
Hon. John Jasper, New York City: 
Asa rule boys and girls are taught in separate classes, but there aro classes of 
grammar grades in which both sexes are taught together, and there are many more 
classes of primary grades in which the same State of affairs is found. It is impossi- 
ble from the nature of our reports to determine the number of classes in which both 
sexes are taught together. lt is an almost invariable rule to teach the boys and the 
girls in separate classes where the numbers are large enough to permit this separa- 
tion. 
Hon. W. H. Maxwell, Brooklyn, N. Y.: 
It is the policy of our board of education to teach boys and girls in separate 
classes. It isnot, however, always practicable to do this under our scheme of class 
organization. Out of a total registry of 96,054, at the close of last year, 16,160 were 
taught in what we denominate as ‘‘ mixed” classes, that is boys and girls in the same 
@lass. The sexes are quite evenly divided, being at the close of the year, 47,963 boys 
and 48,091 girls. The proportions of boys and girls in the mixed classes will probably 
hold about the same. 
Hon. Edwin P. Seaver, Boston, Mass.: 
First. Boys and girls are taught separately in the Latin schools. 
Second. They are taught separately i in the high schools of the old city, namely, in 
the girls’ high andin the English high (boys). 
  
1The ten cities of this group not replying are New Orleans, La,; Fall River, Mass.; Omaha, Nebr.; 
Trenton, N. J.; Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, 0.; Reading, Milwaukee, Wis. It 
appears from current reports that coeducation is the rule in all these cities, with the exception of the 
high schools of New Orleans.

Third. They are taught together in the suburban high schools in Roxbury, Dorches- 
Charlestown, West Roxbury, Brighton, and East Boston. 
Fourth. They are taught separately in 25 of our 59 grammar schools. In the 
other grammar schools they are taught together. : 
Fifth. They are taught together in all primary schools and kindergartens. 
Thisunsystematic state of things was brought about by Boston’s annexing the neigh- 
boring cities and towns without changing the organization of the schools more than 
was absolutely necessary. 
Hon. Henry A. Wise, Baltimore, Md. : 
The boys and girls in the primary, grammar, and high schools of Baltimore, except 
in a fewinstances, are taught in separate schools. Number of pupils on rolls Decem- 
ber 31,1892, 54,406; pupils inschools in which boysand girls are taught together, 11,785; 
pupils in schools in which boys and girls are taught separately, 42,621; boys taught 
in classes in which there are no girls, 21,300; boys taught in classes in which there 
are girls, 5,785; girls taught in classes in which there are no boys, 21,321; girls 
taught in classes in which there are boys, 6,000. 
Hon. W. B. Powell, Washington, D. C.: 
In most of our schools the boys and girls are taught together. Owing to the loca- 
tion and arrangement of school houses, we are compelled to separate the sexes in 
some schoois below the high school. The number of such schoolsis 32, and the num- 
ber of pupils attending there is 3,128 (1,506 boys, 1,622 girls) on a total enrollment 
of 25,262. 
In three of the four high schools of the first six divisions boys and girls are taught 
together. In the Central high school they are taught separately.    
This statement relates to white schools only. The superintendent of 
eolored schools, Hon. G. F. T. Cook, says with respect to these: 
In my opinion a very material factor in the promotion and maintenance of good 
discipline in these schools is itssystem of coeducation of the sexes, which, beginning 
with their establishment, has since uninterruptedly continued. 
Not only in the advantages ‘accruing to discipline, but in other respects essential 
to progress, has the wisdom of this education of the sexes been shown. Healthy 
competition has been stimulated and keen, active thought awakened. ‘To the 
rougher nature of the boy have been imparted tone and refining influences; to the 
gentler naturo of the girl, strength and elasticity. The enrollment of boys is less 
than that of girls, being about 43 to57. In theprimary schools they are more nearly 
balanced than in the grammar, in the former the ratio being about 12 to 13, and in 
the latter 17 to 33. 5 
The enrollment of boys to girls is now 44 to 56. 
Hon. Wm. J. McConathy, assistant superintendent, Louisville, Ky.: 
(1) There is no inflexible rule in our schools below the high school in reference to 
sex inclass. About one-half of the classes contain boys and girls. 
(2) The number of taught in mixed classes is about 5, 000. 
(3) The number of girls about 5,100. We do not find that mixing the sexes works 
any injury; on the contrary, it generally benefits the school. 
  Denver, the remaining city of the list, presents unique conditions. 
With a population of 106,713, the city is divided into three school dis- 
tricts, each having its own superintendent. In two of these, i.e., dis- 
trict No. 2, superintendent, Hon. L. C. Greenlee, and district No. 17 
superintendent, Hon. J. H. Van Sickle, coeducation is the rule, but in 
district No. 1, superintendent, Hon. Aaron Gove, the boys (5,043 in 
1893) and girls (5,018) are in separate classes. 
Following the classification of the United States census, there are 
besides the 50 principal cities above considered. 393 cities having a 
population of 8,000 and upwards; of these 287, or 73 per cent, responded 
to the inquiry on coeducation and of this number 20 only report sepa- 
rate classes for boys and girls, a very much smaller proportion (7 per 
cent) than was found in the group of 50 principal cities (32.5 per 
cent). Separate classes in the high schools or high-school grades only, 
are reported in 5 of: these cities, i.e., Augusta and Macon, Ga., Cov- 
ington, Ky.; Hagerstown, Md.; Burlington, N. J.
-P-A-G-E-159
  COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 789 
Hon. W. ©. Warfield, superintendent of public schools, Covington, 
says: 
Our eighth yoar grade pupils are taught in separate classes; 62 boys and 71 girls 
are now enrolled in this grade. 
A part of our seventh year grade pupils are taught in separate classes; 31 boys 
and 38 girls are so taught. I am now watching the results of separate classes for 
boys and girls. If a school were provided with A 1 teachers, I think separate classes 
would not be necessary. At the present time I am of the opinion that little or noth- 
ing is gained by separating the boys and girls into different classes or rooms. 
Montgomery, Ala., which belongs to this group of cities, has a high 
school for girls but none for boys. 
In the following cities of this group separate classes are the rule: 
Vicksburg, Miss. (in white schools only), Lebanon and York, Pa., Alex- 
andria, Va. There remain 10 cities whose population is 8,000 inhabi- 
tants or more, in which separate classes are maintained in particular 
grades or in part of the schools irrespective of grade. This appears 
to be occasioned by the location or plan of the buildings, or to be the 
esult of long-standing custom in particular schools. The cities and 
grades specified are as follows: Newburyport, Mass. (primary and gram- 
mar); Salem, Mass. (one grammar school); New Brunswick, N.J. (pri- 
mary and grammar); Union, N. J. (grades first to seventh, inclusive) ; 
* Peekskill, N. Y. (first and second year); Raleigh, N. C. (fourth to 
seventh years, white schools); Allentown, Pa. (few primary schools); 
Harrisburg, Pa. (primary and grammar, few schools); Reading, Pa. 
(high school and some schools of lower grade); Columbia, 8S, C, (part 
of the schools, fourth to tenth grades). 
The following additional particulars furnished by the superintendents 
named, show very clearly the causes of these varying usages: 
Dr. William A. Mowry, Salem, Mass.: 
The old school (grammar and primary) was for boys; later arose a girls’ school. 
So now, “down town” as we call it, there are (1) one grammar school for boys; 
(2) one grammar school for girls; (3) one primary for boys, and (4) one for girls. 
In the rest of the city are three grammar and ten primaries tor boys and girls both. 
The high school is for both, although the boys sit in separate rooms from the girls. 
They recite together. 
Hon. Otto Ortel, town of Union, N. 
There is no special reason why boys and girls are separated in our schools except 
for convenience, our buildings being located in the center of a large plat of ground, 
thus giving a large yard or playground on each side, and consequently no crossing 
other rooms or halls in entering or leaving. About 750 girls and 725 boys are in 
separate classes; about 130 girls and 120 boys in mixed classes. 
Hon. Edward P. Moses, Raleigh, N. C.: 
We are limited in Raleigh by special legislative enactment to seven grades, or 
seven years of school work. In the colored schools boys and girls are taught together 
in every room. The sexes are not separated, because of the fact that the different 
buildings are widely scattered. In our white schools the pupils during the first 
three years of school are permitted to attend that building most convenient to their 
homes, the boys and girls being taught together. In the fourth, fifth, sixth, and 
seventh years of schools, the sexes are taught in different buildings. It is properto 
add, however, that, at the request of parents, girls are permitted to attend the boys’ 
school, though no boys are allowed in the girls’ school beyond the third grade. 
Hon. L. O. Foose, Harrisburg, Pa.: 
At one time the sexes were separate in all schools in this city. The sexes are 
educated together in same room in all but a few buildings in the older part of the 
city. The number of distinctively boys and girls’ classes is becoming less each year, 
and in a few years we will have coeducation throughout the city. The two high 
schools, each fora different sex, were recently united into one school with one course 
of study. What we now have of the separate schools is what still remains of the 
old order of things. There is but little sentiment against mixed schools.

  790 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
There remain the following nine cities, with populations below 8,000, 
that report the separate education of the sexes: New Castle, Del. 
(intermediate and grammar grades); Marysville, Ky. (intermediate and 
high); Columbus, Miss. (white school, all grades except high schools) ; 
Matteawan, N.Y. (first to third primary); Chambersburg, Pa. (all below 
grammar grade); Carlisle, Pa. (all except first primary and high 
white schools; coeducation in colored schools); Danville, Pa. (high 
school); Mauch Chunk, Pa. (one school); Corpus Christi, Tex. (prior to 
1893, all grades; 1893, sixth to eighth grades only). The reasons for the 
special conditions here noted are much the same as those advanced in 
the larger cities. 
Peculiar conditions are noted in a few instances. Superintendent 
W. H. Hockenberry, of Chambersburg, Pa., says : 
Until the present year our high school was in two departments, one for cach sex, 
making really two schools, but after five or six years’ hard work the present board 
decided to unite the schools. 
The secretary of the Carlisle school district says with respect to the 
white schools of the district: 
. After the children have passed the first grade primary department they are sepa- 
rated, and do not come together until they reach the high school grade. In this 
interval we have six schools for girls, taught by lady teachers, that have 252 girls 
on the rolls, with an average attendance of 240. There are five schools for boys, two 
of which, second grade of the primary department, are taught by lady teachers, the 
others bymen. In these schools there were 255 boys, with average attendance of 236. 
From the organization of the schools in 1836 to 1888, the white boys and girls were 
separated after they had passed through the first grade primary department, and 
never came together again, as we had a boys’ high school and a girls’ high school in 
different localities and under different teachers. In September, 1888, this scheme 
was changed as above stated, and now the boys and girls, after having been separate 
in the intermediate grades, are brought together in the high schools, and, as we think, 
with the very best results in the manners, morals, and attainments of the scholars 
of both sexes., It is now a question with our board whether there should not be 
coeducation in all the grades of the white schools, and I should not be surprised if 
_ it shall be so ordered as soon as suitable buildings and grounds are obtained. 
The results of the inquiries here summarized agree substantially 
with those of the similar inquiry of 1883. They are somewhat more 
comprehensive, as the replies from State superintendents and from 
74 small cities cover fully the facts which are brought out in 
the earlier inquiry by returns from 144 towns and cities of less than 
7,500 inhabitants, while the number of cities of larger populations com- 
prised in replies to the present inquiry is more than three times the 
number that responded in 1883. Three-fifths of this number (133 out 
of 196) are represented in the replies to the present inquiries. In 5 
of these cities, viz, Belleville, Ill.; Marblehead, Mass.; Easton, Pa.; 
Knoxville, Tenn., and Austin, Tex., change from the separate to the 
coeducation policy has taken place since the earlier inquiry. The 
superintendents of schools in 3 of the cities that have thus come over 
to the majority comment as follows: 
Hon. H. D, Updike, Belleville, TlL.: 
Neither discipline nor instruction suffers in consequence of coeducation of the 
sexes. 
Hon. J. B. Gifford, Marblehead, Mass. : 
Until two years ago, boys and girls of our grammar grades were taught separately. 
We think that the change has been a great benefit intellectually and morally. 
Hon. W. W. Cottingham, Easton, Pa.: 
The policy of this city (Easton, Pa.) in the matter of the coeducation of the 
sexes was adopted several years ago, and the schools of every grade, from the high

) 
COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 791 
school to the lowest primary, have been, and are still, organized, classified, and 
taught agreeably thereto. The scheme as affecting the moral, social, or intellec- 
tual condition of the pupils has been attended with results that are gratifying, and 
especially so when compared with what was attained under the old system of sep- 
arate sex assignment and instruction. 
These results leave no doubt as to the position of our public schools 
with respect to the coeducation of the sexes. 1+ is the policy generally 
pursued, heartily indorsed by supervising officers and strongly sup- 
ported by the people in all sections of the country. The ‘ common,” 
or publie school, of the United States is, as it has ever been, a school 
where boys and girls mingle as they do in the family. If additional 
proof were needed that parents favor this policy, it would be found in 
the fact that a little less than two-thirds of the private schools of the 
country are coeducational and that these enroll a little more than two- 
thirds of all the pupils in private schools. As the public school is the 
only schoo! that three-fourths of the people ever attend, the association 
of the two sexes as there maintained must have a very great influence 
upon their social and business relations in after years. It explains, in 
a great measure, the freedom that women enjoy in this country with 
respect to the pursuit of careers, and especially the large share which 
they take in the educational work of the country. Where boys and 
girls are accustomed from early years to compete in intellectual exer- 
cises, they entertain a due respect for each other’s powers, and false 
notions as to the natural endowments of each are dissipated. Relations 
which would cause great irritation and annoyance in countries where 
separate education is the rule, here come about naturally and without 
friction. 
As regards the teaching profession the policy begun in the element- 
ary schools, persists through the public, secondary, or high schools, 
obtains very largely in private secondary schools, and is gradually 
extending to the highest institutions. This is indicated in Table I (p. 
797), which shows the proportion of women teachers in all classes of 
institutions above the elementary grade of the public schools. In.the 
public schools (all grades included), 66 per cent of the teachers are 
women. Their relation to the public schools does not stop here. They 
participate as school officials, and also through the exercise of the bal- 
lot in the local conduct of school affairs.

REMARKS UPON THE TABLE. 
From an examination of column 2 it will be seen that in sixteen States and one 
Territory school suffrage for women is limited to district officers; in four States it 
includes township and county officers. In the three remaining States and one Ter- 
ritory women may vote for all elective school officers. The right thus broadly stated 
goes no further, however, in its essence than the apparently more restricted suffrage 
of the following States: New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Minnesota, 
since, in these, offices not included in the woman’s vote are filled by appointment. 
It would seem probable that women would be eligible to the offices for whose 
incumbents they may vote. This is the case (column 8), excepting in Mississippi, 
where women who are the heads of families may vote for district school offices, but 
may not fill the same. We catch a glimpse here of the underlying cgnviction which 
has given rise to the whole movement; it begins with arecognition of woman’s right, 
as a natural guardian of children, to exercise her judgment in respect to their edu- 
cation, and ends with the demand for her service as a public expediency. In afew 
States, included in the above lists, women are eligible to school offices other than 
those included in the suffrage accorded them. 
These additional positions are filled by appointment, by vote of school boards, or 
by vote at a general election, in which women can not participate. This reminds us 
that, while there is a strong disposition to separate the educational from other civil 
affairs, the end has not been completely attained. Thus, questions of school tax and 
school appropriations can not always be managed apart from financial matter in gen- 
eral, The woman’s vote extends in some degree to these matters in sixteen States, 
as will be seen by the references to the footnote. The number of women holding 
positions above the grade of district officers (column 4) is small. No statistics of 
the district officersis available. 
It should be noted that in many: States cities form districts under special school 
laws; where this is the case they are not included in the table. Asa rule, however, 
women are eligible to the school boards of Northern and Western cities. Among 
the cities in which they are now serving in this capacity are Boston, New York, 
Buffalo, Chicago, Indianapolis, and Detroit.

  794 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Il.—CoEDUCATION IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. 
  While inquiries from foreign countries with respect to coeducation 
relate almost entirely tc the public schools, those emanating from the 
Southern States have chief reference to the eftect_of the policy in col- 
Jeges and universities and the conditions under which it is maintained 
in these higher institutions. 
Sixty years have passed since Oberliu College, Ohio, gave. the first 
example of a coeducation college in this country. In 1880 a little more 
than half the colleges, 51.3 per cent, had adopted the policy. In the 
decade 1880 to 1890, the proportion increased to 65.5 per cent. This 
decade was also characterized by the number of leading institutions that 
opened their doors to women. These, however, were all located in the 
Northern and Northwestern States. In the present number of coedu- 
cation institutions are included 24 State universities and 8 private foun- 
dations of the highest order. 
The former are: California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michi- 
an, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, 
outh Dakota, Tennessee,' Texas, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, 
Wyoming. The latter are: University of Pennsylvania; Columbian, Washington, 
D. C.; De Pauw, Cornell, Boston University, Brown, Vanderbilt, Yale (graduate 
department). 
Harvard University and Columbia College, New York, whose action 
with respect to provision for women is everywhere followed with deep 
interest, seem for the present to have decided against coeducation. 
Harvard by its efforts for the establishment of Radcliffe College for 
women, and Columbia by similar efforts in behalf of Barnard College. 
It will be observed that Vanderbilt University and the universities 
of Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas are the only Southern institutions 
of high repute or large possibilities included in the foregoing enumer- 
ations. Coeducation is indeed a feature of many Southern colleges. 
This would be inferred from the statistics showing number and propor- 
tion of women students in colleges and universities (tables I and IT 
appended). 
The comparative view (table I) would indeed seem to indicate that 
this policy is more general in the South Atlantic and South Central 
divisions than in the North Atlantic, but the comparison is misleading 
unless it be considered that, as a rule, the highest institutions of the 
Southern States are not included in the number practicing coeducation, 
and furthermore that the significance of the showing is modified by 
the special character of the courses in which many of the women stu- 
dents are enrolled. 
The colleges for colored people which form about 15 per cent of the 
whole number included in the statistics of the South Atlantic and South 
Central divisions also lessen the force of the comparison, as these must, 
of necessity, be adapted to the special circumstances of their students. 
The present agitation of the subject in the South arises from the desire 
of Southern women to secure admission to institutions like the Uni- 
versity of Virginia, University of Alabama, ete. — 
In several Southern States opposition has been made to the opening 
of the universities to women on the ground that the number of women 
desiring these privileges is too small to justify the changes involved. 
To this it has been replied that the expense and labor incurred would

COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 795 
be offset by the advantages of retaining at home the girls who now 
seek in Northern institutions the opportunities denied them in their 
own States. This has raised the question as to the actual number of 
Southern girls who attend Northern colleges and universities. To sat- 
isfy inquires on this point an investigation has been made of the eur- 
rent catalogues of Northern institutions, i. e. coeducation colleges and 
universities, and seven colleges for women only.! 
From this investigation it appears that 376 young women from the 
Southern states are enrolled in eighty-one Northern colleges and uni- 
versities. If the number of these students in preparatory departments 
(27) be omitted, the remainder (349) is very nearly 20 per cent of all 
the Southern girls reported in colleges North and South for the current 
ear.

and college departments is as follows:

and its effects upon students and scholastic standards, only those hay- 
ing personal experience in the conduct of the institutions can speak 
with authority. Hence copious citations from the reports of college 
presidents, statements of professors, ete., are included in this chapter

The literature of coeducation consists of arguments pro and con, a 
priori theories, accounts of actual experiments in the establishment 
and conduct of mixed schools or classes, and statements of results. 
In selecting from this mass of matter the purpose has been to bring 
together the strongest arguments and the greatest range of experience 
pertaining to the policy. Much of this material is already before the 
public, but in scattered books or reports. The only new matter which 
the present interest in the subject has developed is found in the reports 
of foreign experts, deputed by their governments to study our school 
systems. The first place in the following compilation has naturally been 
given to citations from these sources. To the European observer coed- 
ucation appears the most striking feature of our educational system. Its

causes they discover in social conditions radically unlike those which 
obtain in the Old World, and it must, as they foresee, forever tend to 
extend and perpetuate these differences. To these relations they are 
naturally more alive than we ourselves, among whom they have spon- 
taneously developed. We should, however, bear them in mind in 
weighing the views of our foreign critics as to the purely scholastic 
effects of the policy under discussion. 
COEDUCATION OF BOYS AND GIRLS. 
[From report of Dr. E. Schlee, of the Realgymnasium of Altona, Prussia, delegate to the Educational 
Congress at Chicago.] 
A very common, although not universal, feature of the American public school is the 
coeducation of the boys and girls, not only in the primary schools (cities) and in the 
country schools, as is also the case with us, but also in the grammar and high schools 
of cities. Furthermore, the sexes are not separated in the normal schools (Lehrer- 
Seminarien), in colleges, and even in universities. In Chicago coeducation is the 
invariable rule; in Boston and New York un‘on and separation are both found. To us 
it seems strange, at least, to see, if only in photographs, boys and girls not only of 
13, but even of 16 years of age, sitting together or standing in mixed rows, going 
through free gymnastics and exercises with wands. It isto be noticed, however, that 
they have single desks; also, that generally the teacher is a lady, even for the free 
gymnastics. All special rooms (i. e., toilet rooms, ete.), and the playground are 
strictly separate for boys and girls. This coeducation has not been without opposi- 
tion; especially in Boston where the system has already been twice severely 
attacked. Ten years ago Dr. Clarke attributed to this the fact, which, however, 
was clscwhere disputed, that American ladies of the higher class were not very 
good housekeepers and mothers. The Commissioner of Education! obtained reports 
from 300 cities and towns, and these were on the whole favorable to mixed schools, 
He therefore commended this policy, arguing that if we must live together we must 
be educated for that purpose; to educate the sexes separately is to change the 
natural order of things.* 
Later Dr. Philbrick stated that by this means (coeducation) the peculiar form of 
education best suited to the different sexes was prevented. But the Commissioner 
responded® that Dr. Philbrick had had no experience in mixed schools and that the 
statistical returns showed only favorable results as far as regards conditions of health. 
At the same time the good effects upon morals were mentioned which had resulted 
from coeducation in Norway and Finland, and reference was made to the unfay- 
orable effects of the monastery education in France. 
A schoolman of large experience also personally told the writer that coeduca- 
tion had a favorable effect on the general behavior, on the bearing of the pupils 
toward each other, and on the whole discipline. Germany takes in this respect, per- 
haps, the right medium between France and America, but if one observes how bene- 
ficial in general is the comradeship of the children of intimate families one might, 
where the nature of the studies and where outer circumstances, especially in smaller 
places, make the union desirable, consider that the American way would be advan- 
tageous in our country also. 
‘The discipline, indeed, is not as strict as inGermany. Whilst formerly in America 
corporal punishment is said to have taken place often enough it isnow every where for- 
bidden in the public schools.‘ Also deprivations of liberty seem not to be practiced. 
Where admonition does not avail, temporary exclusion from school by the principal 
of the school for not more than a month, by the school superintendent 2s long as a 
quarter of a year, or expulsion from school, is the only means. And yet the Ameri- 
can educational method, by reason of the many recitations of the individual scholars, 
gives abundant cause of disturbance and trouble of which much complaint is made.

*3The reference here is to the following observation by Dr. Harris in responso to an inquiry from Dr. Voss, of Norway: “With regard to Mr. Philbrick’s judgment on the subject of coedueation, I think that he stood almost alone among our ablest writers on education in his opinion, The Boston schools under his charge educated the sexes separately. It may be that his experience in that eity had undue infiuence on his opinion.” [Ed.] ‘Corporal punishment in public schools is forbidden by law in the Stato of New Jersey, and in many cities by school law or by school boards. Tho prohibition is far from universal, bub public opinion is very generally opposed to this form of punishment. [Ed.]

In discussing the teaching force of our schools, Dr. Schlee dwelt 
also upon the spectacle, novel to a foreigner, of the general presence of 
women side by side with men in various business and professional pur- 
suits. He expressed the opinion that this transfer of women from the 
domestic circle into careers competitive with men increased ‘“ the rest- 
lessness, haste, and intense strain in all relations of life.” 
Prof. Stephan Waetzoldt, of the University of Berlin, chief commissioner of the 
German educational exhibit at Chicago, says: 
“No distinction in the quality, kind, and aim of instruction is made in any of 
the elementary schools for boys and girls. In the old States the sexes are not, as @ 
rule, instructed together in second schools, but in the central and western States they 
sit together from the primary school to the university, the latter included. This is 
the’ system of coeducation, the education common for both sexes so highly com- 
mended by Americans. At the congress of education at Chicago this subject was 
often discussed, and not one disapproving voice was heard. At first I was alto- 
ether misunderstood when I explained that our views on the education of girls 
Sitter essentially from those of Americans. They see only the advantages of coedu- 
cation, believed to refine the boys and strengthen the girls, and we must accept 
these peculiar conditions just as in domestic life. The intercourse of boys and girls, 
of adults and children, is altogether different from what it is among us, and I doubt 
whether it has a moral advantage. Certain it is, however, that the girls on the 
average are more intelligent than the boys; they go to school longer. In the 
high school of Chicago the proportion of girls to boys is 3:2. As business and 
olitics take up the men’s entire time, the women have become the supporters of the 
igher intellectual interests and the protectors of intellectuality in domestic life.” 
Prof. Emil Hausknecht, of Berlin, for several years professor in the National Uni- 
versity at Tokyo, says on the subject of coeducation in America: 
“As a makeshift, coeducation is better than nothing. As a principle, it entirely 
ignores the needs of the separate sexes, arising from the differences in the develop- 
ment of boys and girls. Boys and girls from the ages 14 to 18 must be differently 
treated, both in regard to the intellectual and emotional nature. Coeducation is 
possible, however, in America more than in Germany or elsewhere, because custom 
and education have given to the girl and the woman greater freedom and determina- 
tion in their manners and appearance, but also give them strong protection against 
encroachments and improprieties. Coeducation is possible in America also, because 
the week has only 5 school days, Saturday being a holiday, and the school day has 
only 5 lessons, of which one is usually a study hour. Besides, grammar and high 
schools require much less severe intellectual efforts, and a much more concentrated 
and simple exertion of the mind than is required in our secondary schools for boys.” 
THE COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 
  [Extract from a report to the minister of the public instruction, France, by Mlle. Marie Dugard, dele- gate to the Chicago Congresses of 1893.] 
Of all the features which characterize American education, perhaps the most strik- 
ing is the coeducation of young men and young women, whether in the public schools 
(primary and grammar schools) and in the high schools, or in the colleges, the scien- 
tific schools, and universities. At least it is most striking to a French observer, for it 
reveals to him a state of mind and of habits which is entirely strange to him. The 
sight of youths of 16 to 18 years, almost men, working, chatting, and enjoying daily 
comradeship with young ladies, who, by reason of their distinction, elegance, and 
often a precocious beauty, seem not at all like students, confounds all his ideas. He 
is astonished that such an ideal should have sprung up in the healthy American mind, 
and he does not dare to think of the results, so opposed do they seem to his moral 
sense. How the United States have come to adopt coeducation, a glance at their ori- 
gin enables one easily to understand. 
When the settlers fixed themselves in America, their first concern after havin, 
cleared a place, built log houses, and provided for the necessities of the material 
life, was to organize schools to the end, according to an expression of an ordinance 
of Massachusutts, ‘that the knowledge of their fathers might not be buried with 
them in their tombs;” but as they were too poor to give to every village two school 
buildings, they opened only mixed schools, where the pupils of the two sexes 
received the same instruction. This system, which offered real pecuniary advan- 
tages without any moral danger—as the children were restrained by the bonds of 
relation or friendship between their families—was extended, and outlived the 
causes which had created it. Rich and prosperous cities covered the prairies of the set- 
tlers, palaces took the place of the log cabin of the first builder; but, among allthese 
changes, coeducation remained.

  COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 801 
Harmless as it is for small communities and for elementary classes, is it so still 
when transplanted into the new conditions of the modern life and into all orders of 
instruction? This is a question much agitated in the United States. It would be 
indeed a mistake to believe that the mixed education is so inwrought into the Ameri- 
can customs that it never encounters opposition. In certain communities it is, on 
the contrary, much criticized, and several cities, especially in the East, have entirely 
discarded it; others retained it only in the grammar and primary schools, sometimes 
in the latter only. 
The controversy is worth analysis, for it enables us to see the possible results of 
coeducation and illuminates one of the most important problems of American peda- 
ogy. 
2 “The organization of a being is always in harmony with the functions which 
nature assigns to it,” say the opponents of mixed education; now the organization 
of woman differs much from that of man, therefore she has different functions and 
should not receive the same education. These principles do not involve in them the 
thought that woman is inferior to man. 
“The highest ideal of humanity,” wrote an ardent adversary of the mixed school 
in a book which was formerly considered an authority, rejecting any comparison of 
jnferiority or of superiority between the sexes, ‘‘demands that each be perfect after 
his nature. The lily isnot superior to the rose, nor the oak tree superior to the clover; 
neither is the beauty of the lily the beauty of the oak, nor the purpose of the oak 
tree the same as that of the clover.” It would be a poor horticulturist who would 
treat them in the same way. And he adds: ‘If womansubjected to masculine educa- 
tion intended for the development of the male organization can equal man, she 
ought to surpass himif she receives feminine education designed to develop the 
organization of woman.” 
From these general arguments proceeds a long series of objections physiological, 
intellectual, and moral, which we will summarize: 
Coeducation is injurious to the health of the young girls; less strong than the 
boys, they can not endure the same work without hurting their organism; and to 
oblige them to study together is to substitute for the sound emulation, which reigns 
in tke separated schools, a morbid rivalry from which their nerves must suffer. 
Their excessive pride prevents them from admitting that this régime exhausts them; 
desirous to equal young men and even to surpass them, they study with greatzeal and 
constantly strain the activity of their brains, The results of this overpressure, one 
> can see to-day in the American woman, intellectual, refined, brilliant indeed, praised 
by Europeans on account of her spirit and grace, but pale, feeble, of a delicate 
beauty which soon vanishes and incapable of having a large family. Therein lies 
an imminent danger for the future of the race, and if this is not remedied, there 
willsoon be a race of women, capable of being doctors, journalists, advocates, archi- 
tegts, engineers; in one word everything except wives and mothers. 
More than this, the woman, having different functions from the man, has not been 
endowed with masculine intelligence, and consequently it is not reasonable to impose 
upon her the studies and methods which are suitable for the masculine mind. ‘The 
boys should work as boys and the girls as girls. Mary can master Virgil and Euclid 
as well as George, but both of them would be weakened and would not attain 
their legitimate end if they were condemned to the same methods. In ail their 
work women should respect their characteristic organization and remain women and 
not strive to be men, or they will fail utterly. For the two sexes there exists no 
exception to the law that their greatest power and their greatest perfection lie in 
the complete development of their organism.” 5 
The differences in the intellectual development of the young people of either sex 
is also opposed to their common education; until the age of sixteen or seventeen 
years the young man has a mind less developed than the young girl; if he works 
with her he will be discouraged and give up efforts which do not offer him any sue- 
cess. 
From the moral standpoint the consequences of coeducation are still more dan- 
gerous. It is a law that if two individuals live together the one who has the 
strongest personality becomes the model for the other. “Educated with boys, the 
young girl, having a temperament weaker and more supple, copies the manners of 
the boys and loses her graces, whilst the boys do not become softer by the feminine 
association. Finally, it is impossible that between young men and young women 
associated every day in the familiarity of classes there should not be formed some 
romances, which the American education, it is true, renders inoffensive as far as 
regards manners, but which will nevertheless have disadvantages. 
These objections seem judicious, and in the light of them it seems that coeduca- 
tion ought to be abandoned, but it is necessary to hear how its partisans defend and 
justify its continuance. A 
It must be observed, in the first place, that besides the advantage of conforming 
to the ‘historical origin of the United States and to the habits of the majority, it 
has unquestionable advantages; it is economical and permits the use of a part of 
* ED 92—51
-P-A-G-E-172
802 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  the school funds for the purchase of books, apparatus, etc.; it conforms to the 
natural method—that is, to the organization of nature and society; finally, in unit- 
ing the minds of the two sexes in the same culture, it gives them common thoughts 
and tastes, and so prepares for the happiness of family life, where the principal 
eause of dissensions is the barrier which is raised between the ideas, the sentiments, 
and the belief of husband and wife. 
Taking up the objections of the opponents, the defenders of the policy reply to 
them by considerations which are not without value. 
It is assumed, they say, that woman, not having the same nature as man, must not 
be educated in thé same way. That is a poor argument, for in reality the soul has 
no gender. But let us admit that there exist between the man and the woman great 
differences on the intellectual side as on the physical; we can not draw from this an 
argument in favor of separate education, as the resemblances are, in spite of all, 
more numerous than the oppositions. 
If the lily and the rose, following the figure of Dr. Clarke, require different cul- 
ture, does not their common need of air, of sun, and of dew permit the horticulturist 
to let them bloom in the same garden? Some maintain that if woman can accom- 
plish much with a masculine education, she would accomplish more with a feminine 
education. Ought one not to say the contrary, that the more dissimilar the two 
sexes, the more useful it is to woman to be educated with man, in order to acquire 
certain virile qualities which she will never possess if she remains shut up in her 
femininity? 
It is asserted that the excessive work and the morbid rivalry of the mixed schools 
are injurious to the health of young women; but this dangerous emulation, and this 
overpressure, are not due so much to coeducation as to the general organization of 
modern instruction. 
In the schools where the scholars of the two sexes are separated the programs are 
so arranged that the girls study as much as the boys, and it is often seen there that 
emulation degenerates into unwholesome jealousy. The delicate health of women, 
of which advantage is taken in this discussion, originates from causes that have 
nothing at all to do with mixed education. It is caused rather by the enervating 
dryness of the climate; by the feverish activity and the unhealthful habits of Amer-. 
ican life, habits from whose debilitating influence the less robust female suffers most, 
and by the unhealthful dress which custom imposes upon young women and which 
qeeyents their taking as much exercise as young men, while it makes worl harder 
tor them. 
“Women, and even girls at school,” says C. H. Dall, ‘take their studies in addi- 
tion to their home cares. If boys are preparing for college, they do not have to take 
care of the baby, make the beds, or help to serve the meals. <A great many girls 
at the high schools do all this.” 
To all these causes must be attributed the weak health of the American women, 
and it is entirely unjust to make coeducation responsible for it. 
Resting upon the principle that woman has not the same mission as man, some 
contend, also, that it is not desirable forher to receive the same instruction. This 
reason had formerly some weight when woman remained at the fireside, confining her 
activity to domestic duties and depending upon her father, her brothers, or her hus- 
band for the care of her future; but times have changed; in the present state of 
our social organization many women are obliged to provide for their own needs and 
often for those of their families. Forced to work for their living like men it would 
be unjust to refuse to those whom nature has made more feeble, the same means of 
defense—that is, the same culture, the same knowledge. The opponents of mixed 
instruction acknowledge entirely this truth; several concede to the woman the right 
to have the same knowledge as man, but they add immediately that as her mind 
is not the same she must not acquire them in the same way, and from this difference 
they derive the necessity of separate education—a false conclusion, for there exists 
often among certain children of the same sex greater mental differences than 
between young men and young women, taken as a whole, and yet noone thinks on 
that account of providing a special teacher for theni. It is the duty of the pro- 
fessor to use a method flexible enough to accommodate itself to the different intellec- 
tual necessities of his pupils. 
To this the answer is, that when the young men work with young women whose 
livelier minds are more capable of assimliation, young men are discouraged. Expe- 
rience has proved, on the contrary, that the feminine quickness excites the slower 
intelligence of the boys; if there really have been young men repressed by the suc- 
cess of women, it is certain that the success of a comrade of the same sex wouldhave 
had the same effect. 
There remain the moral objections. According to the testimony of eduéators, who 
for a long time have directed mixed schools, young women, far from becoming mas- 
culine by the contact with boys, have, on the contrary greater dignity and reserve, 
and the young men, in their turn, lose in the society of young girls that rough- 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
  COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 803 
  ness of manner and that carlessness’ in attitude and language which characterize 
the men educated apart from women. As to the last objection, the gravest of all, 
we have here the reply of an educator whose words have special authority, because 
he was partly educated in mixed schools, partly in those open to boys only, and he 
directed for several years the mixed schools of St. Louis: 
“My observations have led me to indorse the statement of Richter: ‘To insure 
modesty I would advise the education of the sexes together, for 2 boys will preserve 
12 girls or 2 girls 12 boys innocent amidst winks, jokes, and improprieties, merely 
by that instinctive sense which is the forerunner of natural modesty. But I will 
uarantee nothing in a school where girls are alone together, and still less where 
joys are.’ I had noticed that the atmosphere of ‘mixed’ schools was desexualized, 
where that of separate schools seemed to have a tendency to develop sexual ten- 
sion. Again, whatever tendency toward indecency might manifest itself was far 
more easily checked in ‘mixed’ schools by reason of the crossfire of watchfulness 
which made intrigue far more difficult to keep secret. The brothers and sisters and 
other relatives and intimate acquaintances of the pupil attended the same school, 
and every act was scanned from two points of view—the boys being participantsin 
boys’ gossip, and the girls being participant in girls’ gossip—and the barriers being 
removed within the precincts of the family, parents could not fail to have a more 
faithful account of the behavior of their children than when isolated in different 
schools. Brothers and sisters mutually protect each other from shame. Besides 
this, the fact that the chief association between the sexes in ‘mixed’ schools takes 
place under the eye of the teacher and in recitation, wherein the contest is purely 
intellectual and where the manifestation of mere femininity—softnessand sentiment- 
alism—would cause the pupil to lose rank as a scholar; and where mere mascu- 
linity—roughness and willfulness—would make an unattractive spectacle, leads one 
to expect that the tendency of coeducation is to elevate the standard of admiration 
from mere external charms of person to-the spiritual graces and gifts which lie deep 
‘in the character.” 
To these judicious considerations must be added certain observations which the 
opponents of coeducation do not seem to havé taken into account; and, first, that the 
habit of being educated together is for young people of both sexes a better safe- 
guard against love than continued separation. A young girl whose companions are 
almost exclusively of her own sex becomes romantic and is easily enamored, but 
one who has been always associated with young men, having experience and matu- 
rity, does not yield to extravagant enthusiasm. Moreover, in the love that may 
spring up in the mixed school there is nothing to alarm the severest moralist, and 
this because the oversight, as Dr. Harris has shown, is much greater there than any- 
where else; and because the young American girl has a profound sense of her dignity, 
the young man a great respect for the woman, and both together the habit of self- 
control, there will result only a marriage, in which the tenderness’ is the more 
enduring because the husband and wife have so long known each other. It would 
be well if such marriages should happen often. 
But will not the preoccupations of such attachments hurt the studies? This is a 
chimerical fear. As the relations are above all intellectual, a rising love, far from fos- 
tering idleness, will inspire more earnest work in order to secure the appreciation of 
the loved one—daily witness of failure and successes. 
To these theoretic arguments in favor of coeducation there is added a final con- 
sideration more important than the others: It has triumphed in all the cities of the 
Middle States and the Far West, and even in the East it has a tendency to extend in 
spite of opposition. Some Americans speak of a reaction; but this triumph in the 
Western States, numerous and extensive and called to an important part in the 
future of America, does not justify this prediction. It is not for me certainly to 
judge of this. It would also be presumption for me to pretend to settle the question 
of the inferiority or the superiority of the mixed schools after having seen the great- 
est educators of the United States divided as to the subject. Therefore I will offer 
only in conclusion my impressions. 
It did not seem to me that in the mixed schools the hygiene, the work, and the order 
suffered from the presence of the pupils of another sex, and the appearance of the 
classes seemed to me even better than in the separate schools. But what disturbs 
the pedagogical sense is the great excess of the female sex in the high schools, both 
among the scholars and among the teachers. The majority of American youth—enter- 
ing there at the age of 15 or 16 years—two-thirds, even three-fourths, of the pupils 
in the higher classes, are girls. Thisdisproportion is bad for the youngmen. If itis 
good for their manners not to be separated from the women, it is dangerous to their 
manliness to be always in contact with young girls. Moreover, if the guidance of a 
female teacher is best for them when they are very young, at about 14 or 15 years, and 
perhaps younger, they ought to have different control. 
It is impossible, at least without seeing it, to realize how painful is the spéctacle 
of a young woman, who has not yet in her tone and attitude the authority which
-P-A-G-E-174

  age and long experience give, directing young men from 16 to 18 years of age. 
Certainly, neither the discipline nor the respect suffer from that, so profound is the 
deference of the American scholar for his lady teachers, but it is nevertheless true 
that in this ideal of instruction something is wanting. The female teacher can not 
secure from the young men all the intellectual work of which they are capable, she 
can not come into intimate relation with their adolescent mind, nor can she give 
them a manly development. Thus one whole part of education, the most fruitful and 
the best is eliminated, and the occasion is lost forever. It is right to acknowledge 
that these faults are not inherent to the system of coeducation. They arise from 
the particular conditions of American life, and in other countries it would doubtless 
be easy to avoid them. But would coeducation be acclimatized anywhere else? And 
in France, where it exists already in some departments of instructions, should it be 
extended to all? This is a question which I shall not consider here,!

of the installation of the educational exhibit of France at the Chicago

public instruction to the educational congresses, have simply noted 
the fact of coeducation in articles upon America published since their 
return to France. 
The former says: 
The girls are educated in America together with the boys. They sit on the same 
benches, pursue the same lessons and the same exercises without any distinction what- 
ever, for the boys even take part in the sewing exercises and are very proud to exhibit 
their needlework every year beside that of their female companions. They would be 
astonished, I was told, if any one seemed to be surprised at this. I refer here to the 
first school years. Later some separation takes pla¢e in spite of all the theories in the 
world, and I have seen embroideries made by the girls and works in wood and iron 
by the boys. (Chicago et Exposition. Notes d’un visiteur Frangais. Rev. Péda- 
gogique, June, 1893, p. 487.) 
Dr. Compayré, in an article upon the educational congresses, says: 
We cast our eyes over the audience—women predominate. The coeducation of the 
sexes commenced in the schools is continued in the congresses. (Rev. Pédagogique, 
November, 1893, p. 387.) 
[Extracts from a report by Anna Bentzen, of Norway, who visited the United States for the purpose of studying the system of coeducation.] - 
The first school I visited was the Toledo high school. Here, as usually in the 
West, all public schools are mixed, and even the private schools do not class the 
boys and girls separately. 
* * * * * * * 
I noticed that the high school in Toledo (average age of pupils from 15 to 18) and 
in many other places presented an overwhelming majority of girls. In many classes 
Isaw from 5 to 6 boys among 40 girls. The question forced itself upon my mind if 
this condition was due to coeducation. I addressed inquiries to principals and 
teachers as to the cause of this phenomenon, and I received the answer that practical 
life has much greater attractions for a lively boy than the school. * * * 
Mixed schools are undoubtedly not the only form of schools in the United States, 
but when one observes the tendency theretoin all places where coeducation formerly 
found no sympathy, in most of the Southern States (whose history deviates in gen- 
eral from that of the Northern States), one can see how the system has prevailed 
there also theoretically ; practice follows later wherever it is possible. That sepa- 
rate, as well as mixed schools, are found in cities of the Eastern States, e.g., in Bos- 
ton, shows simply the possibilities of a large city as to satisfying various views and 
wants. * * * Itis plain that the cause obtains footing more and more, instead 
of losing it. All school authorities, superintendents and directors, who were so 
obliging as to enter more thoroughly into the question with me pronounced them- 
selves unconditionally in favor of the policy, and presidents of colleges and univer- 
sities expressed themselves in the same terms wherever coeducation had been intro- 
duced. In vain they look for intellectual inferiority of women, even in the highest 
educational institutions. 
  
In the continuation of the report, which is not yet published, the author consid- 
ers the conditions under which coeducation is possible, and comes to the conclusion 
that it is impracticable for France.

  COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 805 
  It is true that fewer women than men go to universities after having finished the 
high-school studies. However, the percentage is constantly increasing, and, in com- 
parison to the number of men, an equal number of women take their degrees with 
the highest credit. In the fall of 1890 there were 198 female students at the Wis- 
consin State University in Madison, and about four times as many men. At Ann 
Arbor, Mich., there was about the same proportion upon a total of 2,153. students. 
Coeducation in Wisconsin dates only from 1863, after the university had been in 
existence for many years (from 1838), and in the beginning it was not coeducational 
in the exact sense‘of the word, since the young women were instructed in a so-called 
normal department. At last, in 1873, all peculiarities in the instruction of women 
were done away with, and the university was opened to both sexes without any 
restrictions. The president of Ann Arbor University told me that the first woman 
student entered the university in 1871, and passed the fiery trial of public criticism 
and the university examinations with the greatest honors. Her example was soon 
followed by others, and for the last ten years coeducation at this university, as well 
as at many others, has been an established feature, and no more comments are made 
upon the subject, at least none that are unfavorable. Even the professors, who 
were most opposed to the new arrangement, confess that experience has conquered 
their opposition. 
In some universities they are from principle opposed to coeducation. Harvard 
College, near Boston, has established a so-called annex for women students, but 
refuses stubbornly to give lectures before a mixed audience; for what reasons, the 
author has not been able to find out. This annex arrangement does not give satis- 
faction; it savors too much of ‘‘second hand,” even although the privileges are the 
same as those bestowed upon Harvard proper. The women students up to this time 
have shown most interest in the branch of philology, but natural sciences gain more 
and more attention and original scientific investigations by single individuals have 
already been undertaken. The law schools are not attended by many women stu- 
dents, but in those of medicine there have been numerous women students for quite 
a number of years, and now and then some follow even the course of engineering. 
But the professions whose courses are followed by women in isolated instances only 
are of little consequence in the question of coeducation. When it is fully established 
in future the woman’s inclination will prove to be equally as good and safe a guiding 
star as that of man, and there is no reasonable foundation for the apprehension that 
she will follow stadies not befitting her sex. * * 
In some places I noticed a strict separation of sexes both in respect to their seating 
in schoolrooms and their marching in or out, and in most places there are separate 
playgrounds for boys and girls. One can easily recognize the necessity of the latter 
upon seeing that the pupils are but little supervised during the recesses. Separate 
cloakrooms are found everywhere. But as far as I could find out these trifling 
arrangements were the only ones thought necessary for the sake of order and morals. 
One should remember the rough material which American schools receive. 
Recent immigrants, no matter if from the east or west, and without knowing a 
word of English, are received in the common schools or high schools. In the mean- 
time there is something in the surrounding air that softens the uncouth nature of 
the child, and at the same time as he becomes familiar with the language of his new 
fatherland he imbibes the respect for his own worth as a human being and for the 
rights of his comrades, which is the profoundest principle in an American com- 
munity. If those from the lowest classes of the community were kept aloof and 
the two sexes kept separate, would the teacher in such a case be able to bring about 
such changes? * 
It must not be imagined that all schools possess a class of clean, well-situated, well- 
educated children, who might besent to anexhibition; but although there are schools 
which use up all the energy of a teacher within a short period of time, destroying her 
good humor and tempting her to use a cane, we find that such is most often the 
case in those schools where no coeducation is advocated, and where now, as in some 
schools in Boston, they are afraid of introducing coeducation because wildness and 
mone nes seem ” pe their inheritance and possession. 
* * * * * 
In America, young boys and girls associate in a friendly way together from their 
earliest childhood. They have all opportunities to become acquainted in school. 
Thad ‘special opportunities in the Western States to observe these natural rela- 
tions both in university cities among the students and other young people who were 
following practical careers. The young girls were strikingly easy and natural in 
their manners. From a moral standpoint, I discovered only healthy results from 
the American coeducation. It still remains to examine its effect in a physical 
aspect.

  I have been much impressed in American schools (both in lower and common 
schools) by the weakly, pale-looking children with bad carriage of the body and 
much nearsightedness, judging by the distance of the books from the eyes. But I 
did not receive the impression that the girls looked more delicate, nor do statistics 
report to this effect. 
* * * * * * * 
Both boys and girls suffer from overcrowded classes (being pinned down to the 
desk for long hours), from bad ventilation and severe drafts, the want of play- 
grounds, and one-sided mental work. | 
* * * * * * * 
Finally, I will add a remark on the economical feature of coeducation: 
When I consider the equipment of the American high schools, as I saw them in 
most cities, and then imagine these expensive buildings doubled in order to accom- 
modate each sex separately, there arises a strong doubt in my mind. Would it be 
possible to furnish these schools with expensive laboratories (not with 1, but with 
3), with excellent microscopes, well-supplied libraries? Hardly in smaller cities 
where there is at present only one high school; however well the boys’ high school 
might be equipped, the girls’ high school would no doubt leave much for improve- 
ment. 
COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES. 
Dr. W. T. Harris, 
[Report of Public Schools, St. Louis, Mo., 1872-'73, pp. 105-120.] 
* Previous to 1858, in our grammar schools, the sexes had been entirely separated. 
Only in the primary schools and in the high schools, then recently established, had 
the experiment of coeducation been made. In that year the Franklin Grammar 
School was opened as a ‘‘mixed” school, and after it, one by one, the other grammar 
schools were reorganized until all except the Eliot School were “mixed” schools, 
receiving into the same rooms and classes both sexes. Having had an unusually 
good opportunity to watch the results, and having been educated myself partly in 
“mixed” schools and partly in schools open only to the male sex—the former being 
sundry district schools in country towns, village “academies,” and city grammar 
schools, the latter being three classical schools or academies and a college—I felt 
considerable confidence in the views then presented, My observations had led me 
to indorse the statement of Richter:! ‘To insure modesty I would advise the edu- 
cation of the sexes together; for two boys will preserve twelve girls, or two girls 
twelve boys, innocent, amidst winks, jokes, and improprieties merely by that instine- 
tive sense which is the forerunner of natural modesty. But I will guarantee nothing 
in a school where girls are alone together, and still less when eye are.” Thad noticed 
that the atmosphere of “mixed” schools was desexualized, where that of separate 
schools seemed to have a tendency to develop sexual tension. Again, whatever 
tendency toward indecency might manifest itself was far more easily checked in 
“mixed” schools by reason of the cross fire of watchfulness which made intrigue 
far more difficult to keep secret. The brothers and sisters and other relatives and 
intimate acquaintances of the pupil attended the same school, and every act was 
scanned from two points of view—the boys being participant in boys’ gossip, and 
the girls being participant in girls’ gossip, and the barriers being removed within 
the precincts of the family, parents could not fail to have a more faithful account of 
the behavior of their children fhan when isolated in different schools. Brothers and 
sisters mutually protect each other from shame. Besides this, the fact that the chief 
association between the sexes in ‘‘mixed” schools takes place under the eye of the 
teacher and in recitation, wherein the contest is purely intellectual, and where the 
manifestation of mere femininity—softness and sentimentalism—would cause the 
pupil to lose rank as a scholar, and where mere masculinity—roughness and willful- 
ness—would make an unattractive spectacle, leads one to expect that the tendency 
of coeducation is to elevate the standard of admiration from mere external charms of 
person to the spiritual graces and gifts which lie deep in the character. ? 
1Recently cited from Richter's ‘Levana” by Dr. Clarke in his Sex in Education. 2'The following statements were made in the report alluded to (1870), and I have had no occasion to modify the views therein expressed : “That which theory establishes and experience verifies may be safely followed. The cooducation of tho sexes within the limits of certain ages and within certain sections of the United States may be considered approved by the twofold demonstration of theory and practice. Whether these limits of age and place may be transcended with advantage is a question for practical experiment to solve. Theory is in favor of the extension of coedueation far beyond present practice, and, as a fact, tho lat- ter is éreeping along conservatively up to the standard of the former. ‘The admission of females into

  But the question of healthy moral tone is not the only one involved. Granting 
the most favorable view of this phase of the subject, we have not yet settled the 
question whether it is desirable for women to have the same course of study that 
men have, nor have we touched that other much debated question arising from 
physiological differences. 
The question of education has always pointed back to that of vocation and des- 
tiny, for education is a process of preparation for an end. Thus it involves the 
theory of the life sphere of the pupil. Again, besides ‘‘vocation and destiny,” there 
is an‘absolute state of man,” as Pestalozzians tell us, for which every human being 
has a right to educate himself and be educated. The culture of the rational soul, 
the intellect, the will, and the affections, is the privilege of every human being, 
whether male or female. Moré than this, itis a duty; and the materialism, at present 
so fashionable, that finds its delights in chilling the fervor of an aspiration by sug- 
gesting physiological limitation as that which should determine the question of the 
culture of the rational soul and of participation in the spiritual heritage of the 
colleges and scientific institutions, heretofore open exclusively to males, is the straw on the moving current, and tells what is coming. It is in accordance with the spirit of our institutions to treat women as self-determining beings, and as less in want of those external artificial barriers that were built up in such profusion in past times. We give to youth of both sexes more privileges or oppor- 
tunities for self-control than are given in the Old World society. Each generation takes a step in advance in this respect. “Occasionally, as in San Francisco, there 1s a returning eddy which may be caused by the unbal- anced condition of society found on frontiers. Old cities like New York and Boston may move very slowly in this direction, because of enormous expense required to change buildings and school yards so as to adapt them to the wants of ‘mixed schools.’ In fact, the small size of school yards in many cities renders this change next to impossible. . Western cities take the lead in this matter and outstrip 
the East. Within fifteen years the schools of St. Louis have been entirely remodeled on this plan, and the results have proved so admirable that a few remarks may be ventured on the experience which they furnish. I wish to speak of the effects on the school system itself, and of the effects upon the individual pupils attending. “J. Economy has been secured through the circumstance that the coeducation of the sexes. makes it possible to have better classification and at the same time Jarger classes. Unless proper grading is interfered with and pupils of widely different attainments brought together in the same classes, the separation of the sexes requires twice as many teachers to teach the same number of pupils. ‘Thi 
remark applies, of course, particularly to sparsely settled districts. ‘The item of economy is very considerable, but is not to be compared with the other and greater advantages arising. 
“While it is conceded by the opponents of coeducation that primary schools may be mixed to adyan- tage, they with one accord oppose the system for schools of a higher grade. Now, what is singular in our experience is the fact that our high school was the first experiment on this plan for classes above the primary. Economy and better classification were the controlling reasons that initiated this experi- ment, and from the high school the system has crept down through all the intermediate gi our high school tho sexes aro assigned to separate study rooms, and meet only for actual recitation in the same room.) What had been found practicable and satisfactory in the highest grades could not long be kept away from the lower ones. “II. Discipliné has improved continually with the adoption of mixed schools. Our chango in St. Louis has been so gradual that we have been able to weigh with the utmost exactness every point of comparison between the two systems. “The mixing of the male and female departments of a school has always been followed by improve- ment in diseipline, not merely on the part of the boys, but on that of the girls as well. The rudeness and abandon which prevails among boys when separate at once give place to self-restraint in the pre: ence of girls. ‘The prurient sentimentality engendered by educating girls apart from boys—it is mani- fested by a frivolous and silly bearing when such girls are brought into the society of the opposite sex—this disappears almost entirely iz mixed schools, In its place a quiet self-possession reigns. ‘The consequence of this is a general’ prevalence of milder forms of discipline. Boys and girls origi- nating, according to nature's plan, in the same family as brothers and sisters their culture should bo together, so that the social instincts may be saved from abnormal, diseased action. Tho natural dependence of each individual upon all the rest in society should not ke prevented by isolating one sex from another during the most formative stages of growth. “TIL. Instruction is also greatly improved. Where the sexes are separate, methods of instruction are unbalanced, and gravitate continually toward extremes that may be called masculine and femi- nine. Tho masculine extreme is mechanical formalizing in its lowest shape, and the merely intellec- tual training on its highest side. Tho feminine extreme is the learning-by-rote system on the lower side and the superfluity of sentiment in the higher activities. Each needs the other as a counter- cheek, and it is only through their union that educational methods attain completeness and do not foster onesidedness in the pupil. We find here that mixed schools are noted for the prevalence of a certain healthy tone which schools on tho separate system lack. More rapid progress is the conse- quence, and we find girls making wonderful advances even in mathematical studies, while boys seem to take hold of literature far better for the infiuence of the female portion of the class. “IV. Intellectual development is, as already indicated, far more sound and healthy. It has been found that! schools kept exclusively for girls ‘or boys require much more surveillance on the part of the teachers. Tho girls, confined by themselves, develop the sexual tension much earlier, their imagination being the reigning faculty and not bridled by intercourse with society in its normal ‘orm. So it is with boys on the other hand. Daily association’ in the class room prevents this tension and supplies its place by indifference. Each sex testing its strength with the other on an intellectual plane in the presence of the teacher—each one seeing the weakness and strength of the other— earns to esteem what is essential at its true value. Sudden likes and dislikes, capricious fancies and romantic ideals, give way for sober judgments not easily deceived by mere externals, ‘This is the basis of that ‘quiet self-possession’ before alluded to, and it forms the most striking mark of ditlerence between the girls or boys educated in mixed schools and those educated in schools exclusively for one sex. “That the sexual tension be developed as lato as possible, and that all early love affairs be avoided, is the desideratum, and experience has shown that association of the sexes on the plane of intellectual contest is the safest course to secure this end.”

  race, will have exactly the opposite effect from that intended. It will produce an 
asceticism proportioned to the amount of conviction occasioned by such physio- 
logical doctrines, and to the consequent intensity of the recoil. If our highest norm 
is ‘‘ chiefly clinical,” and the mind with its culture is subordinate to the organiza- 
tion of the body, as is believed by (shall I say) a great majority of physiologists 
and physicians at the present day, at the least there are very many things relating 
to human history and institutions which become at once insoluble contradictions, 
the nearest example of which is the evolution, in the brain organism, of the theory 
in question. 
One does not need to be reminded that human history is a record of deeds done in 
the cause of spiritual ideals, and that these ideals are the bases of all our institu- 
tions of civilization. The deeds of history, moreover, that are considered worth 
recording are most strangely subversive of physiological and hygienic laws, most of 
them involving such waste of human life as to lead even the materialistic spectatcr 
to believe that life as such is of small moment compared with some phantom idea 
secreted by the cells of the brain. To such a view, human history isa record of 
uninterrupted fanaticism, and the fruits of preaching the physiological gospel to 
young men or young women in the nineteenth century will only produce fanaticism 
of a kind that is not needed. By these remarks one would not intend to deprecate 
the study of physiology and hygiene, nor deny the function of the brain and nerves 
as instruments of manifestation, nor the application of hygienic laws to education. 
One objects only to the “animus” with which the thing is done, and to the theory 
of life and mind which is implied as their major premise by certain prolific writers 
on the subject, and one insists upon the doctrine that mind is essential self-deter- 
mination whose responsibility extends so far as commonly to make it liable for the 
proper hygienic determination of the physical conditions of its manifestation. The 
physiological motto should be—Know thyself, not as a product of organism, but as 
a producer of organism. 
In our district schools the ages of pupils range from 6 to 15 years, averaging only 
10 years. In the high school the ages range from 12 to 20 years, averaging about 16, 
The physiological question, therefore, scarcely affects the district schools. But the 
pupils of the high school are just at those ages which the physiological question 
touches most vitally. So far as it concerns the question of coeducation at those 
ages, it is simply this: Whether the necessities of class recitation, with its regular 
recurrence and steady progress from week to week, impose any conditions upon one 
sex that can not be borne by it without unreasonably taxing the physical organism, 
It is claimed in the affirmative that the regular work which young men perform 
without injury is unsuitable to young women. ‘Identical coeducation” is, there- 
fore, to be forbidden. Persistence being the type of the man, and periodicity the 
type of the woman, it is argued that they can not be educated together, nor in the 
same manner. Stated in plain school language, classes imply regularity or persist- 
ence in work, and this is injurious to girls of the ages between 14 and 20 years. 
But this statement at once relieves the question of any special reference to coeduca- 
tion of the sexes in the same school. When one can point outa plan fora girl’s school 
wherein there is no necessity for regular recitation and regular work, and wherein 
the organization is such that three-fourths of the class do not suffer by the constant 
absence of one-fourth of the class, he will have discovered a new organization, 
which wise educators will hasten to adopt, even for boy’s schools. For the average 
attendance of boys on recitations is less than 75 per cent., when the schools through- 
out the country are considered, although it is common for city schools to secure 90 
per cent and over. ‘his per cent of irregularity has forced educators to organize 
careful systems of grading and classification, by which there may be secured an 
amount of elasticity sufficient to save the regular pupil from the injurious effects of 
his neighbor’s absence, and likewise t» save the irregular pupil from the necessity 
of overwork to keep up with the former. As it is, after all has been done, the evil 
of irregularity is counted the most serious drawback that we have to contend with. 
But the statistics of the attendance of girls in the St. Louis high school, compared 
with that of their percentage in scholarship, does not allow us to conclude that the 
progress of the classes sufiers on their account. No satisfactory comparison can be 
made between the work of girls and that of boys; the problem involves too many 
elements; not only quantity and quality of work, but a consideration of the aims 
and motives that stimulates its performance. It is safe to say that no practical diffi- 
culty is experienced in the high schools on account of the larger per cent of absence 
of the girls. There are, it is true, ‘clinical cases” that form the exceptions to this 
rule. Such cases, however, are no more difficult to manage in mixed schools than 
in separate schools. Of course it is out of the question to adopt a system of indivi- 
dual instruction for all girls between the ages of 14 to 20. It would practically shut 
out from a fair education nine-tenths of the entire sex, and the remaining tenth, 
lacking the discipline of class work, would not acquire a thorough education. 
   
-P-A-G-E-179
  COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 809 
Leaving the consideration of the physiological phaso of the subject, it remains to 
be considered whether the vocation of women necessitates a different course of study 
from the general one already marked out for the primary and secondary schools. 
The question of vocation again involves the physiological question and the duties 
arising from particular natural functions. Under all circumstances woman’s sphere 
must include a closer relation to family life than the sphere of man does. Theinter- 
mediate province of civil society including the various phases of productive indus- 
try through which the wants of food, clothing, and shelter are provided may or may 
not by its nature belongto woman. Thethird province, the state, is farthest removed 
from the sphere of nurture which is the peculiar function of the family. In order to 
discuss intelligently this question we must regard it in its historical evolution and 
study the attitude of the sexes toward the three great institutions above named, the 
family, civil society, the state, under the different stages of human progress. 
The savage or barbarous stage of society—the age previous to that of productive 
industry, or the triumph of labor by means of division—is to be characterized as an 
age in which whateveris fixed and routine, whatever can be accomplished by patient 
endeavor confined to prescribed forms or conventionalities, falls to the lot of woman. 
Man is driven by the sudden and severe exigencies contingent to savage life to hold 
himself in reserve for violent and temporary efforts such as leave him unfit for 
routine work. War and hunting being the necessary pursuits of man, it is necessary 
to leave to the woman what little agriculture and manufactures there may be car- - 
ried on. 
The slow growth of peoples from the savage state is marked by the division of 
labor; first, slavery appears, and its advent partially relieves woman as a sex; the 
slaves of both sexes labor together at the same tasks, while the women of the free 
class begin to retire within the family. From this stage on there is a growth of the 
antithesis between the family and civil society. In the former (the family) is found 
more and more the sphere of woman; in the latter (that of civil society), that of 
man, until the culmination of the epoch of productive industry which closes the 
second stage of human development or of progress in society. 
From the second step of development arises the third epoch, that of machinery, 
wherein more is produced with less industry. Man gets emancipated from physical 
labor, but is compelled by the conditions of his civilization to compensate for it by 
activity of thought. But the ideal activity of thought is the activity of man’s 
essence, and hence in being compelled to energize scientifically and with organizing 
ideas he achieves indirectly the very highest aim of his being. 
This distinction of the civilization connected with the age of machinery from that 
of productive industry, in its special sense, is very important; it brings with it the 
elevation of woman to more general activities, to a sphere above the tension of sex, 
and above the limitations incident to péculiarities of natural organization. Not 
merely the vanishing of the distinctions in spiritual life that are founded on sex, 
takes place in this epoch, but the disappearance of those that are founded on caste 
and coouparion. of race, of birth, or wealth, altogether throughout the human 
family. 
In the savage state of man the vocations of the sexes separate widely into the 
extremes of drudge and warrior. The education of woman in this period consists in 
acquiring a knowledge of the few arts and dexterities in the possession of the tribe, 
arts representing the whole sphere that will subsequently separate into the antithe- 
sis of family life and civil society, while the education of savage man relates to war 
and the chase, a field of activity wherein may be found the germ of the future political 
organization and the directing power of civil society. Thus inthis phase of life the 
division of sex is the basis of a conservative side of socicty (the sphere of woman), 
which provides for the finite wants,such as food and clothing, and nurtures the 
young, thus forming the internal econom: Over against this is a negative anda 
destructive side (the sphere of man), which is turned against external foes andshields 
society from the violence of nan and beast. Thus the province of man in this state — 
of society has its positive aspect in the fact that it marks out the channels and sets 
up the limits or prescribes the forms of routine work which, as before stated, falls 
mainly to the share of woman in savage life. Thus the savage man fills the roll of 
the lawgiver and defender; he deals with the general or universal interest, the state 
of society as a whole, while woman deals with the particular or finite interests, the 
sphere of wants and necessities. 
Ascending above this into the stage of industrial civilization, we find in progress 
an intermingling of the two former spheres. On the one hand the man who occupied 
the position of director and defender, and who appeared in the role of the generic 
or universal, now descends to the extreme of particularity, and, through division of 
labor, takes on himself the limitation which is required by special branches of 
industry. He descends to the particular and specific so far that he limits his whole 
life activity to the creation or production of some part or portion of a product of 
industrv that must be joined to a hundred other parts before it becomes an article 
   
-P-A-G-E-180
    810 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
a ofany use whatever. His whole occupation, for instance, may be that of tying threads 
or of cutting off pins. Man thus limits himself, as individual, to the finite and par- 
ticular, in order that he may, through combination with civil society, make up a 
concrete whole of surpassing grandeur. In this second stage of society woman 
withdraws more and more within the family and finds in it a whole—inasmuch as 
each family contains a sphere or circle of duties and occupations separable from the 
sphere of civil society as a whole. In the total or whole of civil society each laborer 
performs some one function, however minute, that contributes to form that whole; 
there is only one total—that of the whole industrial community; on the other hand, 
in the institution of the family, each family is a whole, a reflection of the general 
type. On this account woman represents a generic or universal interest—that of 
the totality of the family—in the second stage of historic development, while man 
represents a particular interest in his functions as member of civil society. Each 
woman in the family has the entire round of duties of that sphere to learn and per- 
form, while the man has not to know all the trades and vocations of society, but 
only his infinitesimal fraction thereof. 
From this distinction between the family and civil society flows a well-defined 
difference in education. While the boy is to be educated to concentrate all his 
energies in the pursuit of one specific end—educated to limit himself in order that 
he may manage with intensity of force, and high achievement of skill, some special 
department in the articulated whole of the grand process of society—the girl must 
be educated to be versatile, quick to turn from one thing to another, to be on the 
alert for emergencies and not so absorbed in a single aim as to be oblivious of any 
~ one of the manifold phases of her entire sphere—thesphere of the family. Thus it will 
appear that her culture in the second stage of the growth of society resembles, in 
general outline, that of man in the first stage. Since man, as savage, faced the uncer- 
tain, the indefinite, and was obliged to be constantly on the alert, he dissipated his 
force and utterly unfitted himself for dealing with the definite routine task and the 
prescribed duty, and hence these were assigned to woman. 
No writer has penetrated deeper into this relation of occupation to sex than 
Goethe. He enunciates clearly the principle as he finds it in his time, and his deep- 
seeing mind catches a few glimpses of the coming epoch wherein the antithesis of 
the second stage of human society is to be canceled and solved. 
“Men,” he makes one of his characters say, ‘‘should wear a uniform from their 
childhood upwards. They have to accustom themselves to work together; to lose 
themselves among their equals; to obey in masses and to work on a large scale. 
Every kind of uniform, moreover, generates a military habit of thought and a smart, 
straightforward carriage. All boys are born soldiers, whatever you do with them. 
* *—* But woman should go about in every sort or variety of dress, each fol- 
lowing her own style and her own likings, that each may learn to tell what sits well 
upon her and becomes her, and fora more weighty reason as well—(N. B.) because it 
is appointed for them to stand alone all their lives and workalone. * * * Observe 
a young lady as a lover, as a bride, as a housewife, as a mother—she always stands 
isolated. Sho is always alone and will be alone; even the most empty-headed woman 
is in the same case. Each one of them excludes all others. It is her nature to be 
so—(N.B.) because of each of them is required everything which the entire sex 
have to do. With a man it is altogether different. He would makeasecond man if 
there were none. Buta woman might live to an eternity without even so much as 
thinking of producing a duplicate of herself.” In these words we see how com- 
pletely Goethe comprehended the spirit of the civilization in which he lived—a 
civilization now just beginning to show signs of transition to a new one. General. 
izing his statements, he might have said ‘when that upon which one labors is uni- 
versal, i. e., 2 general element in the supply of a general want, association may come 
in and the individual may limit himself to a uniform particular activity, to a trade 
or special branch of a trade. But not so when the object of labor is a diversified 
one, a totality of contingent particulars; there each laborer must perform all; no 
division of labor can transpire within that sphere—the sphere of the family, for 
example.” Inthe spirit of his time Goethe adds: “In how few words the whole 
business of education might be summed up, if people had ears to hear. Educate the 
boys to be servants and the girls to bo mothers, and everything is as it should be.” 
“To bo servants ”—that is to say, to subordinate and limit themselves to special, 
prescribed occupations; ‘‘to be mothers” would mean, to cultivate that provident 
foresight and wealth of resources constantly required in the family. 
In another passage Goethe hints at the possibility of ascending above these limita- 
tions which arise from the tension of sex and which are thus presupposed by the 
organization of society in his and our own age. ‘‘There is no doubt,” says he, “that 
in all civilized nations women in general are superior to men, for where the two 
sexes exert @ corresponding influence over each other, man becomes effeminate, and 
that is a disadvantage; but when a woman acquires any masculine virtue, she is the 
gainer, for if she can improve her own peculiar qualities by the addition of mascu- 
line energy, she becomes almost a perfect being,”

COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 811 
  Out of the completest realization of the division of labor arises the conquest of 
nature by machinery. In this conquest man becomes truly free and independent, 
inasmuch as he does not any longer have to employ direct struggles to force nature 
to yield her products in a form suitable for his use; he now makes nature do this. 
Fastening a machine to nature, he harnesses the elements, and thus produces an 
activity whose product subserves his rational intelligence. Instead of enslaving 
himself in this particular, in order to become free in the aggregate of society, he 
now finds his whole activity to be a directive or supervising activity, and thus an 
ivity of thought and ideas, as well as of mechanical exertion. This third epoch 
nually arising from the second one, just as fast as the ultimatum of simplicity 
is reached in any occupation and the labor-saving machine comes in to relieve the 
hand. 
Man thus is continually ascending into the realm of thought and directive power. 
In this region there is no longer any unmodified physical nature. Ideas are neither 
male nor female; they are universal. So, too, is directive power. Culture in uni- 
yersals is the necessary education for it. 
While in the division of labor the feminine organization has special adaptations, 
and special unfitness for one sphere or another; on the contrary, in the world of 
directive activity, the special fitness or unfitness arising from sex is a vanishing ele- 
ment, and there approaches an ideal wherein a concrete identity of spheres and 
vocations is to be found. Not that this implies annihilation of nature and sex, but 
only a complete and thorough subordination of them, just as now it is quite as femi- 
nine as masculine to attend school and learn to read. Sex will always remain inits 
narrow sphere, its modifying tone or tinge will extend into several higher spheres; 
but in science, in religion, and art its effects will be scarcely traceable. And the 
ascent from direct manual labor to directive labor, through the introduction of 
machinery, is accompanied with such increase of productivity in labor as practically 
to lift all individuals into easy circumstances, having most of their time for higher 
ursuits. 
- To the mere animal, sex is the most important fact of his existence, and with good 
reason, for he lives only in the species, and does not possess individual immortality. 
A conscious being is, by the fact of consciousness, elevated above the sphere of sex, 
and becomes immortal as individual. 
To sum up the views here advanced, there seem to be three epochs in education 
derived from the changing status of the sexes toward each other as determined by 
vocation: 
1. There was the condition of women in the savage state when division of labor 
within civil society existed only in germ, and the functions of family nurture and 
of providing food and clothing and shelter—the sphere of productive industry and 
civil society—belonged to women. Man gave his whole attention to defense, the 
province of the State, and the police function. He also hunted in the forests for a 
supply of meat. Hunting was partly industry, partly defense from wild animals. 
2. Out of the savage state rises the epoch wherein civil society becomes fully 
developed, the era of productive industry and division of labor. The nation takes 
the place of the tribe, and frees man from perpetual police service. He settles into 
productive industry, and as he occupies civil society, woman retires within the 
family. Persistency is the type of labor in civil society. Periodicity the type of 
labor in the family; repetition of the same thing, concentration upon one thing, the 
characteristic of labor in the industries; diversity and versatility the characteristic 
of the labor within the family; engaged this hour preparing the breakfast and 
washing the dishes; the next making the beds and sweeping the rooms; the next 
cleansing and mending the clothing; the next knitting or weaving; the next, and at 
intervals the whole day, attending to the myriad wants of childhood. The labor 
within the family is as diversified as in civil society, and could be improved in skill 
by division of labor; but it does not admit of division of labor to the same extent. 
‘The woman prepared for the life of the family would therefore seem to need an 
education which would give her versatility, while the boy should have an education 
which would fit him for infinite concentration upon one thing. The girl should be 
educated to stand alone and to work at the confusing variety of tasks in the family. 
But the boy should learn to work in combination with others, to subordinate himself 
as a member of an organization. 
For the second stage of social development, therefore, persistence and periodicity 
would seem to characterize, respectively, the spheres of labor of men and women. 
3. But this phase of civilization is not the highest and final one. Out of the 
extreme Civision of labor arises the possibility of machinery. When labor is divided 
so minutely that each branch of it consists in a simple movement of the hand, arm, 
or body, the human intellect contrives a cunning mechanism and harnesses some 
natural power to it, perhaps water power or steam power, and straightway he 
becomes a mere manual laborer—a supervisor. From a slave he becomes a master. 
The machine gets thrust in everywhere between the human hand and the raw mate- 
rial. More than this, theitellect contrives combinations, and complicated machines

812 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  grow out of simple ones. The human being becoming more and more powerful, 
again, physical force is less and less needed in the supervision of the machines. Ver- 
satility and agility come more and more into play. The female is needed again in 
the industries, and she comes back to tend the power-loom and to make Waltham or 
Elgin watches. In the third and highest period of industrial development, there- 
fore, where physical strength is less and less in demand and alertness more and 
more in demand, woman’s sphere comes to be common with that of man, and she 
needs an education in the sciences, arts, and accomplishments necessary to the 
man. Besides this the realm of productive industry and division of labor, aided by 
labor-saving machines, encroaches upon the domain of special labor confined within 
the limits of the family and conquers one after another its drudgery, and reduces it 
to a general branch of industry. The power-loom, the sewing and knitting machines, 
the washing machine, the baker, the tailor, the manufacturers of preserved and pre- 
pared food, etc., are rapidly emancipating the slavery inside the family. We can not 
ignore the effect of great social changes arising through the invention of labor-saving 
machinery, and the consequent aggregation of population into towns and cities where 
cooperation may be availed of. ut of social changes arises the necessity of modifica- 
tions in our systems of education. The demand of women for equal advantages in edu- 
cation with men is not a mere temporary demand arising out of the sentimentalism 
incident to the epoch, but only an index of the social movement that underlies our 
civilization. The demands on the woman of the present day are such as to compel her 
to educate herself in science, art, and history. Hernatural proclivity to versatility and 
alertness of mind fit her in a peculiar sense for the sphere of teacher of children. ‘Their 
arbitrariness and caprice can be best watched and foiled byher. Their feeble strength 
demands intermittence and periodicity, and their training must, above all, be gentle. 
To enter into the spheres of productive industry opening for her; to assume the place 
of director in the management of the family economy now offered her in exchange 
for that of drudge; to fill her sphere of hostess and conversationalist in polite 
society; to fill the sphere of teacher in the school; to enter into the literary domain 
recently conquered by such writers of social novels as George Eliot and George Sand, 
or into the art domain of music and the drama, conquered long since; all these con- 
spire to demand for woman discipline, insight, and information, studies such as are 
necessary to initiate man into the “ conventionalities of intelligence.” The demand 
for the same course of study is paramount, that for coeducation subordinate, although 
of considerable importance. 
THE COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES. 
By Dr, E. E. Wuirr. 
The coeducation of the sexes has become one of the live questions, and the argu- 
ments pro and con are numerous and various. One of the arguments against educa- 
tion is based on the difference between the male and the female mind. Itis affirmed 
that the minds of men and women differ, and it is inferred that this difference neces- 
sarily demands a difference of education. Is this inference a necessary consequence 
of the fact affirmed? Let us see. The physical organization of the two sexes is 
diverse. Does it follow that they require a diversity of food? Boys and girls sit at 
the same table, eat the same kinds of food, and breathe the same air, and their 
bodies are equally well nourished and strengthened. The mere fact of mental div 
sity no more necessitates a diversity of education than physical diversity necessi- 
tates a diversity of food and air. What must be shown is, that the mental differ- 
ence of the two sexes is such as to necessitate a difference of education, and this 
necessity must be proved; it can not be inferred. It is not axiomatic. The fact 
that there is sex in the mind does not necessitate sex in courses of study and instruc- 
tion. 
Equally defective is the argument against coeducation based on the diversity of 
pursuit and mission. It is affirmed that the sphere of action of men and women as a 
class is diverse, and it is inferred that they consequently require a different prepara- 
tion, and hence a different education. Are these inferences necessary consequences? 
Why may not diverse minds derive a diversity of preparation from the same course 
of education? Almost every family is an illustration of the fact that different per- 
sons receive different influences and advantages from the same surroundings and 
circumstances. ‘The oak and ‘the elm growin the same soil. The same is true in 
education. The two sexes derive a diversity of preparation from a like course of 
study, each eliminating and appropriating according to its own law and its own 
life’s needs and duties. This argument is eminently absurd when applied to ele- 
mentary and general education. The fact that a boy is to do a man’s work in life, 
and a girl a woman’s work, hardly proves that they should not study arithmetic, 
geography, and geometry together. When applied to special or professional educa- 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
    
COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 813 
tion the argument may have weight, Moreover, the difference in man’s and woman’s 
sphere of action may require a difference of education, but this is precisely the fact 
to be established. si 
The argument against coeducation based on the difference in the physical strength 
and endurance of men and women is more logical. If it be a fact that women, as a 
class, have not the necessary physical stamina to endure a course of education as 
thorough and extensive as men, then it follows that women, as a class, must receive 
an education less thorough and extensive than men, as a class, are capable of receiv- 
ing. But it does not follow that the education of women should be less thorough 
than that which men are receiving; nor does it follow that women who are physically 
capable of competing with men in the highest culture should be denied the privilege. 
But where is the average limit of woman’s physical capacity in education? So far 
as our common schools, high schools, academies, and normal schools are concerned, 
this limit has not been ascertained. In these grades of study she does her work as 
easily as her brother, and equally well, though not precisely in like manner. If her 
inferior physical strength practically limits her educational progress such limitation 
must be found in the college or university course, and this fact can only be settled by 
experience. It does not fall within the scope of logic. 
It will be noticed that we do not deny the facts which form the premises of this 
triple argument against the coeducation of the sexes. We admit that the intellec- 
tual, moral, and physical natures of men and women are not precisely identical, and 
this difference may be sufficiently marked to justify some diversity in their higher 
education. While we would give a daughter an education every whit as thorough 
and complete as a son, we are not sure that we would have their education in every 
respect precisely the same. The diversity would not, however, be sufficiently great 
to necessitate their attending separate schools. Whether all our colleges and pro- 
fessional schools should be opened to men and women alike, we are not prepared to 
decide. We would like to see enough of them so opened to afford the women of the 
country the highest educational advantages; and yet, could our word do it, we 
would, in addition to the Oberlins and Michigan universities for both sexes, endow 
Harvards and Yales for women. 
We feel sure that such institutions would be attended by many more women than 
the mixed colleges. Experience indicates that but few women, comparatively, wish 
to take a regular college course. Oberlin, and a few other colleges, have for years 
welcomed women to their classes, but very few have availed themselves of the advan- 
tages offered. Meanwhile, Vassar and other higher seminaries for women have been 
well attended. There seems, at least, to be little danger that the opening of college 
doors to women would overcrowd college classes. A few girls, possessing as a class 
superior abilities, would be added to the class rolls. What will be true in the future, 
when woman’s pursuits and mission are enlarged, we can not say. j 
We intended to notice the logic of several of the current arguments in favor of 
coeducation, but a want of space forbids. Suffice it to say that the non sequiturs are | 
not all on one side. The logic that can jump from the fact that boys and girls are’ 
brought up together in the family to the conclusion that the sexes should be simi- 
larly associated in boarding schools will not pay puncturing. It is sufficient to say 
that there is not ahigher institution in the country thatadopts, or can adopt, the unre- 
stricted freedom and social community of the family. This sort of talk is, however, 
a good deal better than the clap-trap which denounces colleges for men as “relics 
of barbarism.” Such a performance requires neither brains norsense. The truth is 
the universal coeducation of the sexes is, to some extent at least, a question of moral 
elevation and enlightenment. There are evident advantages in bringing together 
young men and women of high moral character and refinement in the same institu- 
tion, and even under the same roof, but such an arrangement would hardly do in 
Peru or Mexico, since the essential condition would be wanting. We are not sure 
that it would work well in all the institutions of this country. The arrangement 
requires an all-controlling and vitalizing moral and Christian influence, and where 
this is wanting coeducation, involving coboarding, is a doubtful good; at least there 
are two sides to the question. We would give every woman the opportunity to 
acquire the highest and best education possible, and leave experience to settle the 
rest. (National Teacher, June, 1872, pp. 214-216.) 
The organization of the high schools of Boston naturally meets with 
approval from the opponents of coeducation. On this side must be 
included the late Dr. Philbrick, whose superintendence of the Boston 
schools!'forms one of the most important chapters in the history of 
educational administration in this country. Dr. Philbrick regarded 
the specialization of the high schools of his city as the end of an evolu-  
-P-A-G-E-184

tionary progression which had alzeady been attained in the “most 
advanced educating countries.” His position is shown by the follow- 
ing citations from a circular of information published by this office in 
1885. The reader should keep in mind the statement by the present 
superintendent of the Boston schools as to the status of the high    
schools,' and also that of the superintendent of Salem schools,? to which 
Dr. Philbrick refers. In respect to the foreign precedent, it should be 
remembered also that provision for higher education of women has not 
yet been developed in the German States, which alone are mentioned 
by Dr. Philbrick, and consequently their example has really little bear- 
ing upon the question before us. 
{Circular of Information of the U.S. Bureau of Education, No. 1, 1885.], 
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN THE UNITED STATES. 
  By Joun D. PHILBRICK, LL. D. 
We have seen that in Boston the foundation of the high-school system was begun 
by a specialization of institutions instead of a specialization of courses within an 
institution. In harmony with this method a separate classical high school for girls 
was opened in 1878, although this plan was opposed by the friends of coeducation, 
who urged as a substitute the admission of girls to the Latin school for boys. In 
the meantime the first high school for girls, above mentioned, having been set up in 
advance of public sentiment, had a short life, being abolished under the lead of 
a very eminent and public-spirited citizen, who represented the aristocratic senti- 
ment, which is always anxious to keep the education of the people within pretty 
narrow limits, A quarter of a century later the establishment of a city female nor- 
mal school was immediately followed by the demand of the people for a girl’s high ~ 
school, This demand was met by the makeshift method of reorganizing the normal 
into a girl’s high and normal school, the result being a good high school and a poor 
normal school. In time the specializing process took the poor, pinched normal 
department out of this double organization and organized it into a separate school, 
which soon became yigorous and efficient. We find here also another interesting 
illustration of the process of specialization in the development of the high-school 
system by the annexation of adjacent municipalities. The Boston system was by 
, this means increased by the addition of 5 high schools, mixed both as to sexes and 
courses; and, besides, the old, endowed Roxbury Latin Grammar School above 
alluded. to, was opened to the inhabitants of the whole city as a free classical school 
for boys. 
The annexed mixed schools were allowed to remain mixed as to sex but their 
courses were unified in conformity with that of the English high school, the ele- 
ments of Latin, however, still being permitted in addition for the local conven- 
ience of beginners in the classical course, who must later go to the central Latin 
schools in order to complete the preparation for college. At the same time an 
advanced course of two years was added to the original course of three years in the 
central boys’ English high school and inthe corresponding school for girls, to which 
the graduates of the local high schools were admitted, and, finally, anew highschool 
of the local type has been recently established to accommodate the inhabitants of 
an outlying district of the city. 
The system as it now stands then, exclusive of the free corporate school above 
referred to, consists of 6 local mixed schools of the lower order and the 4 central 
schools of the superior order, a classical and a nonclassical one for each sex. 
This central group of 4 high schools may be regarded as the normal type of 
high-school organization. Itisin harmony with the organization of secondary edu- 
cation in the most advanced educating countries, which educates the sexes in separ- 
ate schools and provides separate classical and nonclassical schools for boys, of 
which the representative types are the German gymnasium and the Realschule. 
Considerations of economy will prevent this specialization in the small cities. In 
the largest cities, as we have seen, the progress towards this specialization is already 
considerable, and the history of education justifies the prediction that it will con- 
tinue to advance in proportion as the inhabitants comprehend what is best in educa- 
tion and demand it for their vhildren. . 
The ancient and cultured city of Salem is the only city where a fair trial of the 
- specialized and doubly mixed systems has been made. ‘The former was tried first 
1 See pp. 787, 788. 2 See p. 789.

  COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 815 
for many years; it was exchanged for tho latter, twenty-five years ago, to save 
expense, The result has not been satisfactory, and a movement is now on foot for 
restoring the specialized system, which is said to meet with no serious opposition, 
except from the economical point of view. 
But the specialization of the high-school system in our large cities is not to stop 
here. We see already that Baltimore has incorporated into her system an institu- 
tion for higher education, patterned after the corporate manual training high school 
at St. Louis. It seems quite probable that high schools of this kind, with such mod- 
ifications as experienco may suggest, will be established in all the principal cities. 
Such a school will, no doubt, meet the wants of a certain class of pupils, but if 
adopted it should be in addition to the standard types of classical and nonclassical 
high schools, and not as a substitute for either of them. And the reasons for estab- 
lishing a supplementary high school of this kind for boys hold equally good for 
a lishing a corresponding school with appropriate hand work for girls. (Pp. 
24-25.) * 
  * * = * ® * 
Free secondary education having now become a fixed fact, attention in the future 
will naturally be given in larger proportion to the work of perfecting its organiza- 
tion and management, so as to adapt it more completely to the wants of all classes 
of citizens and render it an instrument of the greatest possible good, accompanied by 
the least possible evil. In my view, the evil connected with the high school which 
most leudly calls for a remedy is the harm which it is doing to the health of the girls 
who attend it. This evil is not of recent origin. It dates back to the time when 
girls were first admitted to high schools; it is not limited to any particular descrip- 
tion of high schools; it is found in both small ones and large ones, in separate schools 
and mixed schools. Nor is it restricted to any one region or section of the country; - 
wherever there is a high school, there the evil is found, and there the application 
of the remedy should begin. Of course, the harm inflicted has its degrees. 
There may be schools under very judicious management of parents’ committees, 
superintendents, principals, and teachers where the injury to the health of girls has 
been reduced to a minimum. I am not aware, however, that such a school has 
come under my observation. On the other hand, there is a large number of schools, 
among which are somo of the most noted in the country, where the injury inflicted 
upon the health of the female pupils is a very serious evil. What I mean is 
precisely this: That the evil of which I am speaking is general in our high schools 
and that the reform in this respect should be general; not that the evil reaches every 
individual pupil, but that it affects injuriously some pupils even in the best schools, 
and a large percentage of the pupils in that large class of schools where, as yet, 
hygiene is only a word and not a realit; In justice to the public high schools, it 
should be said, however, that the evil is not confined to them. It is quite serious, 
if not more so, in the whole body of thoroughly organized institutions for the higher 
female education. e 
The causes of this evil are manifold. The following are some of them: Injudicious 
application of the marking system; injudicious system of examinations; too many 
studies; too many home lessons; an injudicious method of teaching, which con- 
founds thoroughness with exhaustiveness; too much pressure to secure punctuality 
and regularity of attendance; rolls of honor printed in annual reports; competition 
for honors and medals; too long abstinence from substantial food and nourishing 
drinks; bad air; cold drafts; too many flights of stairs. These manifold causes 
suggest the manifold remedies. The remedies can be more easily and effectually 
applied in separate schools than in mixed. To remedy the evil in question effectu- 
ally in mixed schools without too great laxity towards the boys is no easy task. 
Higher female education has come to remain. It is anew element in modern civili- 
zation, It is a great boon. It has been attended with a lamentable evil which has 
largely offset its blessings. Let the remedying of that evil be one of the chief tasks 
of all earnest promoters of higher female education.

MAJORITY AND MivNoriITY REPORTS OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON THE SUBJECT 
OF COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES. ‘i 
MAJORITY REPORT. 
In ScHoon ComMITTEE, September 9, 1890. 
At the regular meeting of the board, March 25 of the present year, on motion of 
Mr. Winship, it was ordered ‘that a special committee of three be appointed to con- 
sider and report upon the subject of coeducation of the sexes, with special reference 
to future school buildings.”   
 
-P-A-G-E-186
See, EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  « In compliance with this order we submit the following: 
Tt appears that not until 1790 were girls admitted to our public schools, when they 
were permitted to enter the grammar schools then established, on an equal footing 
with boys. A few years prior to 1830 several unsuccessful attempts were made by 
members of the schoo! committee to separate the sexes. It was not until the latter date 
that Lemuel Shaw succeeded in influencing the committee to make the departure. 
‘The school committee, January 15, 1830, directed a subcommittee ‘to inquire whether 
essential improvements may not be introduced by a modification of the present sys- 
tem, or by the adoption of some other.” This subcommittee reported, May 11, 1830, 
through their chairman, Lemuel Shaw. 
From this report the following abstracts are taken: 
“The last defect which the committee will notice arises from the attendance of 
children of both sexes on the same masters, at the same houses, and pursuing in all 
respects the same modes and branches of study. 
“The committee recommend that an entire separation be established between the 
schools designed for children of different sexes. By this management we think some 
evils and dangers will be avoided, and decisive advantage gained. Under the present 
system, through the strict attention of the masters, little evil, perhaps, has been 
experienced. 
“Tt is well understood that until the year 1790 there was no public provision what- 
ever for the education of females in this town. The Latin grammar schools and the 
public writing schools, being the only schools supported by the public, were designed 
exclusively for boys. By the system then adopted an English grammar department 
was added to each of the three public writing schools, and then, for the first time, a 
provision was made that girls might attend these schools for six months, and no 
more, in each year. This system continued in operation, with some slight alteration, 
by enlarging the term for the attendance of girls to eight months in each year, until 
two years since, when it was determined by the committee that girls should be 
privileged to attend the whole year. 
“The committee have thought that all the girls who now attend the seven schools 
may all be accommodated in the three largest schoolhouses, the Franklin, Bowdoin, 
and Hancock, which would be conveniently situated for the purpose, in the south- 
erly, central, and northerly parts of the city; and that the other four, namely, the 
Adams, Boylston, Mayhew, and Eliot, would conveniently accommodate all the boys.” 
The following resolution was proposed by Judge Shaw for his committee: 
‘That the present arrangement of the Eliot, the Hancock, the Mayhew, the Bow- 
doin, the Adams, the Boylston, and the Franklin schools be changed, and that the 
system set forth in the foregoing report be substituted therefor.” 
ee main propositions of the report were adopted by the school committee June 
, 1830. 
By the regulations adopted by the school committee, February, 1833, it appears 
that the Eliot and Mayhew schools were exclusively for boys, while the Bowdoin 
and Hancock schools were used for the instruction of girls only, the other 5 grammar 
schools remaining as formerly, for boys and girls. 
‘Thus was rooted in our school system an error which may take years to fully eradi- 
cate. 
Since then this objectionable departure, this rut, has broadened and deepened, 
with no obstacles in its way, no influential objection to its sway, until we have 30 
normal, high, and grammar schools, or school buildings, in 15 of which boys alone 
are taught, while in the other 15 buildings girls alone are admitted; and in the 
buildings intended for boys and girls together there are 74 classes, containing nearly 
3,700 scholars, of which 39 classes are formed of boys alone, and the remaining 35 
classes of girls. 
This gives only about 12,547, or 36 per cent, of our scholars in the schools men- 
tioned who are coeducated. 
Thus this city of Boston, that spends relatively more money for the education of 
her children than any other city of the Union, if not of the world, that prides herself 
upon her educational facilities, hampers more than any other city the rightful 
advance of girls and lessens the refining influences in boys by this separation of the 
sexes in our schools. 
The subject is of far weightier importance than a casual or superficial view would 
give it. It involves the question of the development of the maximum ability of the 
scholars in moral, intellectual, and physical training. Underlying it is that subtle 
sychological element which should not be lost sight of, and it is therefore to be 
Heved that each member will give it grave consideration. 
In these modern times of push there is, in certain localities, a great lack of deli- 
cate courtesy or chivalry, particularly among young people. 
The refining influence of woman is well exemplified by Wendell Phillips’s story of 
the young man in the smoking car, who excused himself for using questionable lan- 
guage by emphasizing the fact, ‘‘There are no women here.” A like story is
-P-A-G-E-187
  
           
       COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES, 817 
attributed to Grant. This check upon questionable utterances and acts is noticeable 
in all places where boys or young men are in companionship with the opposite sex; 
and herein lies the greatest good resulting from coeducation. Such constant com- 
panionship represses or subdues the rough and gross nature in young men. 
_It is either right or wrong to have coeducation in our high and grammar schools, 
There is no middle ground in considering this subject. If a lower quality of scholars 
attends school in a certain district, that quality applies to the girls as well as to the 
boys; and if the boys are separated from the girls, still the low quality remains, 
and is only divided. 
If it is right for brothers and sisters to live in the same house and eat at the same 
table, then it is right that they should attend school together. Let them be brought 
up separately, and if they meet only clandestinely, great harm is likely to result. 
If wedlock is right and proper, then coeducation is right and proper. If men 
and women are to marry, they should know each other summer and winter before 
marriage, and the more they know of each other the less likely will divorces result. 
The serious objection raised by physicians to coeducation is based upon the deli- 
cate organic conditions of girls, but by the introduction of the excellent system of 
physical culture made in our public schools the weak and @elicate girls will become 
strong, and the objection will ultimately vanish. 
At Wellesley College, by its special attention to physical and hygienic culture, over 
1,000 young women are required to enter into a thorough course of physical training, 
and itis represented that these students pride themselves on their excellent physical 
condition, which they first endeavor to attain before subjecting themselves to serious 
mental strain. 
To gain the most impressive conclusions upon this subject it was decided by your 
committee that persons interested in education—intellectual, moral, and physical— 
be invited to give their views. Accordingly circulars were sent to the several masters 
of our schools, superintendents, pastors, physicians, and others. 
The following table gives the names of the several normal, Latin, high, and grammar 
schools; the number of teachers in each school in favor of or opposed to coeducation ;

    Of the 254 teachers opposed to coeducation, 122 are teachers of girls alone and 109 
instructors of boys only. They may be considered ex parte in their views, and should 
be ruled out. 
It appears that certain opponents of coeducation have, by an acquired interest in 
teaching boys or girls alone, warped their minds into the belief that the sexes should 
be separated, while others, through a lack of knowledge which experience gains, 
conclude theoretically that coeducation is wrong. 
To teach boys alone requires far more concentrated energy, will power, and nerve 
force or tension, than to teach girls, or boys and girls. The only advantage in hay- 
ing the sexes separated may be to give inferior teachers easy positions in girls’ 
schools. This is not intended to indicate inferior teachers in our schools devoted 
alone to girls, for the masters of such schools are as anxious as any to gain the best 
teachers the State affords, but it is a fact that certain masters of mixed schools have 
separated boys from girls in order to aid inferior teachers. 
A very large majority of the opinions gained coincide with the views entertained 
by a majority of your committee. The committee recommend the passage of the 
ollowing orders: 
1. Ordered, That the normal school be so arranged that young men may enter and join the young swomen in the same course of study. 
2. Ordered, That the boys in the Latin and English high schools, and the girls in the girls’ Latin 
and high schools, be united in mixed classes as soon as practicable. &. Ordered, That the grammar schools in districts where the boys are taught in differer:t buildings 
from the girls be arranged for mixed classes as speedily as the necessary changes in the buildings will 
warrant. 
4. Ordered, That in the grammar-school buiidings where boys and girls attend, but where the boys 
are taught in separate rooms from the girls, the change be made by having mixed classes. 
és. Ordered, Thot all newly erected buildings, and buildings to be erected, be arranged for tho 
coeducation of the sexes.

MINORITY REPORT. 
The undersigned, a minority of the special committee on coeducation, unable to 
agree with the conclusions or to support the recommendations of the majority of the 
committee, respectfully submits the following report: 
It is not deemed necessary by the minority “to traverse the whole subject of coedu- 
cation of the sexes. The subject has been so fully and frequently discussed in recent 
years that the opinion of those interested is undoubtedly already formed. Indeed, 
as to the wisdom or unwisdom of educating together boys and girls, or young 
women. and young men, it does not seem probable to the writer that there will ever 
be any substantial agreement. It is one of those questions about which there will 
always be wide differences of opinion, according to personal experiences and the 
conditions of population in different localities. 
It is easy to see that in small and homogeneous communities the conditions are 
entirely different from those obtaining in large, cosmopolitan cities; and looking at 
the subject from the point of view of “the parent, it is obvious that while in certain 
localities where the population is homogeneous a parent will unhesitatingly send 
his children to a mixed school, he would be unwilling to do so if he lived in a com- 
munity where the conditions of population are quite different. 
In small towns and villages economic reasons seem to make mixed schools neces- 
sary; but in cities the question of expense in maintaining separate schools for the 
sexes is not an issue, and in such places it would seem to the minority a manifest 
injustice to compel a parent to send his children to mixed schools, if he strongly 
objected to doing so. Unless, therefore, it can be shown that there is a principle at 
stake—that it is unjust and wrong to separate the sexes—expediency would cer. 
tainly dictate that the wishes of a very large proportion of this community which 
does not believe in mixed schools should be respected.

820 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  For many years it has been the wise policy of this city to maintain separate 
schools for boys and girls after they have passed the primary-school age, except in 
the suburban districts, where for financial reasons the local mixed high schools and 
some of the mixed grammar schools have been retained; but as it is allowed that 
suburbar. high-school pupils may attend the large city schools’where the sexes are 
separated, provided the parent so desires, it would seem that our present policy is 
an eminently fair one, and that it should not be changed, as recommended by the 
majority of the special committee, unless it can be shown that to separate the sexes 
is wrong, unjust, and unwise. 
Does the repert of the majority show this? The statistical evidence of the report 
seems to the minority of little worth, for the reason that while a very large proportion 
of those interested in changing an existing state of affairs is always active to accom- 
plish their object, those who are not in favor of a change seldom take the trouble to 
defend the status quo uniil they are driven to do so.! The minority has made no 
attempt to collect statistics others than those presented; but he ventures to predict 
that if such changes as the majority recommend were found to be seriously thought 
of by this board, a flood of remonstrances would be forthcoming, not from other 
States and country towns, but from our own educators and from parents of this 
city, which would make the majority’s statistics seem futile indeed. 
Large numbers of letters have been received from teachers in favor of mixed 
schools chiefly on the grounds that it is easier to maintain discipline when boys and 
girls are together, and second, that the influence of the sexes is mutually salutary. 
In regard to the first supposed advantage, the minority would reply that a good 
teacher has no difficulty in maintaining discipline in separate schools, in witness 
of which statement attention is directed to the central high and Latin schools of 
this city, in which the sexes are separated. As to the beneficial influence of boys 
and girls on each other, there is a difference of opinion. That there are certain 
mutual benefits in the association of the young of opposite sexes, under judicious 
supervision and under proper conditions, no one can deny; but whether the judi- 
cious supervision and the proper conditions are generally obtainable in public 
schools is another question; furthermore, it remains to be shown whether the sup- 
posed advantages of association in schools are not by far overbalanced by certain 
evils of such association. 
A favorite argument of those who favor mixed schools is, that as brothers and 
sisters are brought up together in the same family, boys and girls should not be 
separated when they go to school. It seems idle to take time to consider this argu- 
ment; it is enough to point out that parents who delight in the brotherly and sis- 
terly relations of their own children may naturally prefer to have some choice in 
their children’s associates, and may be unwilling that their sons and daughters 
should mingle freely in the mixed public schools with children of opposite sex. 
There are those who take the position that, as marriage is the ultimate destiny of 
- most boys and girls, they ought to be given an opportunity of meeting each other 
in early life in order to enable them to understand each other better, and thereby to 
make their choice more intelligently. To all this the writer would reply that the 
duty of the State is to educate her children in the public schools in the branches of 
common-school education, and not to provide for social intercourse between the 
sexes, however desirable that may be. 
The proper place, in the opinion of the minority, for the young of both sexes to 
meet and to learn to know each other is in the home and in the smaller circles of 
social life, under the eyes of judicious parents and with their approbation. The 
responsibility of the maintenance of proper relations between the sexes, then, rests 
where it belongs—with the parents and not with the state. If it is argued that 
whether boys and girls attend the same school or not they are sure to meet and 
associate more or less out of school hours, the natural reply would be that wise par- 
ents control their children out of school and restrict their associations in accordance 
with their own judgment. 
It is stated or implied in the majority report that a certain injustice is done to 
girls by not allowing them to attend school with boys. The writer fails to see the 
truth of this implication; so far as his knowledge of our schools goes the curriculum 
is the same in all our schools of similar grade, except that girls are taught sewing 
and cooking, while boys are given lessons in the use of tools. If the implied injus- 
tice consists in withholding from girls the stimulating influence of good boys, let 
us be thankful that they may thereby escape certain evil influences of bad boys. 
That the writer may not be thought to overestimate the possibilities for evil in 
the mixed school, let him state briefly the result of his personal experience. He 
passed through all the grades of the public schools and was graduated from the 
high school in a flourishing suburban town, where the schools were second to none 
   ''Phero wero sent to physicians, who ar opposed to coeducation, 165 circular letters of inquiry; out of this number replies were received from only forty-eight: so that the majority report can hardly be said to correctly represent the opinions of the medical profession.

COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 821 
  in the State, and where the teachers were faithful and judicious. Even in the pri- 
mary schools, but more especially in grammar and high schools, words and Actions 
came to his notice that no good boy or girl could hear or see without blushing. 
There were, so far as he knew, no overt acts of positive immorality; but in addition 
to much foolish flirting and frivolity, there were not infrequent instances of outrageous 
offense against good manners and morals. It did not appear that any of these 
offenses could have been prevented by the teachers; but they could not have occurred 
in schools where the sexes are separated. Passing from this atmosphere it was the 
writer's happy fortune to enter one of our Boston schools, of which we all are proud, 
the Boston Latin school. In his three years’ experience in that school there was a 
conspicuous absence of anything of a low or immoral nature, and the contrast with 
his former experiences was as refreshing as it was startling. Can it, then, be won- 
dered at that when some thirteen years ago it'was sought to admit girls to this 
school the writer united with other alumni and did all in his power to avert such a 
catastrophe? The minority would certainly not imply that the pupils of our pros- 
perous girls’ Latin school could possibly be guilty of any impropriety of conduct 
if sent to the boys’ school; but he wishes to express in the strongest way his belief 
that schools are places in which to educate the young, that all possibilities of harm 
should be kept out of them, and that there should be in them no sexual distrac- 
tions. 
There are other objections to teaching the young of both sexes in the same schools 
besides those based on moral considerations; but the minority does not consider it 
necessary to dwell upon them. Much could be said of the unwisdom, considering 
the differing aptitudes and mental attributes of boys and girls, of teaching both 
sexes after the same methods, even if the studies pursued are identical. Much, too, 
could be said of the unhealthful rivalries between boys and girls, and of the baneful 
stimulus to delicate girls to overwork their minds at times when they should be 
allowed to rest. But enough has been said, it is believed, to show why the under- 
siged can not support the changes proposed by the majority, and to warrant him in 
recommending to this board that no action be taken in the direction of coeducation.

Opinions of superintendents, supervisors, and teachers. 
SUPERVISORS, 
Iwas submaster in the Adams school from 1856 to 1864. At that time, as now, 
both sexes were educated under the same roof, but not in the same classes. I 
requested the master (Mr. P. W. Bartlett) to allow me to try the experiment of teach- 
ing both in my room. Previous to that date (about 1858~59) the boys and girls were 
mixed in the first class only. My request was granted, and the experiment was so 
successful that soon it was the common practice in other schools. Of late years I 
have watched the high schools in the outlying districts, where boys and girls study 
and recite in the same rooms, and I feel sure that the results are very satisfactory, 
Iam heartily in favor of the coeducation in well-disciplined schools.

I believe in coeducation of boys and girls.. The muttal influence is refining and 
strengthening to both. The natural emulation is a healthy stimulus and motive to 
study and thought. The moral effect is purifying and elevating, making the rela- 
tions between them less artificial and giving each a true appreciation of the other, 
leading to juster comparisons of the sexes and more hearty respect and good will on 
both sides. Coeducation corrects some of the most troublesome incidents of school 
discipline and throws increased interest into school work; it also develops symmet- 
tically and naturally the social feelings and cultivates courtesy and helpfulness in all 
the relations of life. 
Louisa Parsons Hopkins. 
Ann Arsor, Micu., May 5, 1890, 
{In our Western schools—grammar and high schools—we know nothing by experi- 
ence of separate education of the sexes. Our pupils are all treated exactly alike, 
have the same course of study, the same teachers, recite in the same classes, have 
the same questions in examination, and participate in the same public exercises. 
This is true up to and through the high school. 
In the high school there is this degree of separation: The girls have their own 
“session rooms,” presided over by women; and the boys, their own, presided over by 
men}; but in all school work the sexes mingle. 
In the junior and senior classes of the high school the pupils have class organiza- 
tions, partly literary, partly social. 
These class organizations make arrangements for occasional class social entertain- 
ments, which are held, by invitation, at the homes of class members. No evil seems 
to develop from any of these interminglings of the boys and girls, while their gen- 
eral influence upon each other seems to be salutary. Especially is the presence of 
genteel, cultured girls a great benefit to some of the boys, in restraining, softening, 
humanizing them. 
We believe that boys and girls were intended to be brought up together in families, 
educated together in schools, and yoked together in the same fields of duty and 
usefulness in the world. 
W. S. Perry, Superintendent. 
PHILADELPHIA, April 30, 1890. 
In the Philadelphia public schools the sexes are educated separately, not only in 
the high schools, but, with few exceptions, in every grade of the elementary schools. 
Public sentiment is, however, gradually changing on this question. My own con- 
viction is that boys and girls can be taught to better advantage in every way together. 
Experience shows this to be the case, and coeducation is becoming universal through- 
out this country. 
Jas. MACALISTER, 
Superintendent, 
CLEVELAND, Ouro, May 2, 1890. 
Formerly the practice in this city was to separate the sexes in all the grades, from 
the time of entering the school until the pupil left school, except in instances where 
the smallness of the school rendered it too expensive to so conduct the schools. Pupils 
of both sexes were obliged to recite together in the same room in the high school, 
and in many cases were obliged to be placed in the same general session room, the city 
having but one high school building on each side of the river. No bad effects what- 
ever resulted from this coeducation method, but rather the reverse. As rapidly as the 
old ideas could be overcome, the coeducation of the boys and girls in all the grades— 
high, grammar, and primary schools—was introduced. For the last fifteen years at 
least the coeducation plan has been uniformly followed. 
Ihave no hesitation whatever in commending it to all who are interested in the 
question, either practically or theoretically. No bad results have followed. On the 
other hand, there is a better tone and higher moral standard among the pupils. 
I shall be pleased to receive acopy of the report of your committee, whea printed, 
if the same is for distribution.

  COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 823 
San Francisco, Car., May 5, 1890. 
A close observation on my part during a period of now nearly forty years, forcibly 
convinces me that the coeducation of the sexes is founded in wisdom, and is a very 
great 1dvantage to both boys and girls. 
We have both separate and mixed schools in this city, and my examination leads 
me to the inference that the latter present advantages not to be had in the former. 
We have not, either in our grammar or high schools, had occasion to find any cause 
of complaint upon the part of the pupils, the parents, or the school authorities. 
Indeed, in our mixed schools we find an improved discipline and a greater zeal in 
the work. Our boys, subjected to the influence of the gentler sex, become not only 
more attentive in the prosecution of their work, but verymuch more gentlemanly in 
“their walk and conversation;” and our girls less rude and more ladylike. 
My own experience as a teacher in all grades of schools and with my own chil- 
dren convinces me that the advantages had in mixed schools are very great, the 
disadvantages few.

The inclosed report, written by William A. Stearns, who became president of 
Amherst College, gives an account of the beginning of the coeducation of boys and 
girls in the Cambridge high school. The arrangement then made of “placing the 
grammar-school scholars of both sexes in the grammar schools and the high-school 
scholars of both sexes in the high school” has continued to the present time, and 
during my connection with the schools of Cambridge, a period of thirty-six years, I 
have never heard the wisdom of that arrangement questioned. 
FRaNcIs COGSWELL, 
Superintendent. 
Abstract from the report of William A. Stearns, chairman of the school committee 
of Cambridge, dated March 3, 1846, alluded to above: 
“In a wisely-governed school of this description, the manners of the boys are 
softened and their minds refined, while the girls are placed under that measure of 
restraint which conduces to self-respect, watchfulness, and dignity of character. 
Besides, both sexes become acquainted with the good qualities of each other’s minds 
and hearts. The friendships which exist among them are more likely to be 
founded upon esteem, upon a perception of kindness, of honor, of scholarship, and 
such like virtues in each other, than when thé idea of sex is too carefully kept in 
view. May not the manifestation of undue solicitude to keep them apart operate 
by a natural law of association through the imagination to strengthen the evil 
tendencies deplored? Are there any means more likely to degrade the minds and 
vulgarize the whole character of either sex than to educate them on principles 
which exclude all innocent friendships, all mutual regard for the excellencies of 
each other’s characters, all pure affections and civilities, and lead them to the 
thought that there is nothing attractive in each other’s society but just that which 
is founded on the lowest distinctions of their nature? It seems to us that it is not 
difficult for a wise and pure-minded instructor to inspire his pupils of both sexes 
with those high sentiments of propriety; the boys with that sense of honor, that 
regard for the character of a gentleman, and the obligations of duty; the girls with 
that delicacy and dignity so natural to the cultivated female spirit, and both with 
that just appreciation of what is due to their nature, to public sentiment, to the 
consequences of actions, and to the laws of God, which will not only preserve them 
from gross immorality, but make their intercourse in some schools like that of 
brothers and sisters in the same family, alike purifying and ennobling. 
“ The extreme solicitude of some to keep up this kind of separation reminds us of 
a circumstance which actually occurred in one of our country towns some twenty 
years ago. In a large center school, as occasional glances were sometimes thrown 
across the aisle, it was seriously proposed by a most excellent citizen that ‘a squint- 
ing-board’ should be erected between the boys’ and girls’ side of the house, to pre- 
vent any ‘casting of sheep’s eyes,’ to the detriment of the morals of the school. 
What wise parent would be willing to send his children to a school, in which a 
squinting board should not only separate brothers and sisters, and shut out from the 
two sexes the cheerful light of each other’s countenances, but perpetually remind 
them that there is something degrading, something vulgarizing, something to be 
ashamed of in associating together, and even in looking at each other.

824 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
“ Besides if children can not be trusted together amid all the restraints and pre- 
serving influences of a well-governed school, if they can not be taught to live together 
like brothers and ‘sisters with all purity,’ in the name of common sense what is to 
become of them when thrown out into society? 
“In the opinion of those who attended the late examination, the school has never 
been doing better, at least for several years past, than it is at the present time.” 
  SPRINGFIELD, Mass., April 28, 1890. 
I have always been in favor of such coeducation; and whilst I have had supervi- 
sion of schools in which the sexes were kept separate, from the primary schools up 
through the high schools, I have not seen any good reason for changing my views on 
the subject. 
I have observed in schools where the sexes are educated together, as is the casein 
this city, that they have a mutually beneficial induence upon each other. 1 have 
not found any evils of a serious character at all to result from such association in 
school. . 
I have further observed in places in which the sexes were separate, that such sepa- 
ration in school had the eftect of leading to evils in other unavoidable associations 
on thestreet and on social occasions; evils which, but for this artificial separation in 
school, I believe would not have existed. I believe that what objections there have 
arisen in certain localities to coeducation are due to evils which are not due somuch 
to the effect of coeducation, as they are due to the fact that there are weak teachers 
in the schools who have not the power to create either a stimulating, intellectual, 
or a wholesome moral atmosphere in the school. Wherever the separation of sexes 
appeared to be a necessity I have found weak teachers and poor schools in general. 
I believe that they are related as cause and effect. 
THomas M. BALuirt, 
Superintendent. 
Boston, Mass., August 19, 1890. 
The coeducation of the sexes in our public schools is no longer an experiment. It 
has passed beyond the domain of experiment into that of well-established results. 
Its practical working, and its effect upon the manners, the mind, and the morals of 
pupils have been tested under so many conditions, that it is no longer difficult to 
find data from which to draw conclusions regarding its value. 
It is true that different minds, using the same data, may differ honestly in regard 
to the effect of coeducation upon character; but as to its effects upon mind, man- 
ners, and morals, which are to be judged by their outward manifestations, we may 
paneoe that a fair degree of harmony will exist among observing and discriminating 
teachers. 
My opportunity for gathering data upon this subject has been quite extensive, as, 
with the exception of the four years passed in college, my entire life has been in 
schools where both sexes have been brought together. These have been academies 
made up of young men and women of widely varying ages and conditions, high 
schools and union schools, embracing pupils of all degrees of advancement and 
every phase of social life and character. I have also been familiar with a large 
number of normal schools and universities of the Middle and Western States in which 
the sexes have been associated from their origin. With this opportunity to study 
the subject, I may not seem bold if I express a decided opinion upon the results of 
coeducation. 
Few have failed to recognize the reciprocal relation of the sexes, a mutual desire 
to stand well in the esteem of each other. This often shows itself in an earnest 
rivalry, a quite determined though genial competition which stimulates to mental 
activity without provoking animosity, espevially to that degree likely to exist among 
those of the same sex. The complementary character of the sexes is an important 
factor in their education when allowed to exert itself in their mutual association. 
It is the law of nature the world over, that the contiguity of opposites stimulates to 
activity. Opposite magnetisms attract, opposite minds arouse in each other dormant 
forces. Complementary parts brought together form the unit—the perfect whole. 
The family is the unit in society, because it has all the parts to make up the unit. 
The school is a unit only when it has both sexes. The family is best trained that 
has the training of both father and mother. The daughter gains her most symmet- 
rical growth only in the presence of a brother, and the brother only in the gentler 
influences of the sister.

    COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 825 
That school is best taught and disciplined which combines in its teaching force the 
intellect and character of both sexes. It would seem that teachers, who are students 
as weil as teachers, of the minds under their charge, must have observed the opera- 
tion of thislaw. Young women develop better intellectually in the presence of young 
men, and the contrary is equally true; and what is true of young men and women 
is true of the boy and girl down to an early age. Their minds may not be different, 
but there are subtle forces at work that are different. Nobody sees how the sunlight 
docs its work upon the plant, but he does see that the plant grows, and that sunlight 
is necessary to its growth. Nobody sees how the mental forces of one person enter 
into and do their work upon the nature of another, but he sees that there is such a 
work wrought. : 
The practical results in Cornell University, Syracuse University, the University of 
Michigan, and most of the other universities and normal schools outside of New 
England, demonstrate the value of coeducation. They show that young women do 
better work in the mixed schools than in those devoted simply to female education. 
More of them reach a high degree of proficiency. The notable cases that have come 
from the university annexes indicate the value of contiguous study of the two sexes. 
What has been said of its effect upon mind can be said with equal truth regarding 
morals. - 
‘The constant mingling of the sexes in recitation, the measuring of themselves one 
with another intellectually, begets a self-respect, a circumspection of conduct, that 
protects against undue intimacy, and is a safeguard to the young women as it is a 
barrier to young men. Respect of one party for the ability of the other compels 
respectful conduct on the part of both. 
Manners are so much an outgrowth of moral feeling that where a high state of 
moral culture exists, other things being equal, we expect to find a corresponding high 
condition of refinement of manners. The favorable effect upon young men and boys 
will not be questioned. Their manners are improved, and there are fewer instances 
of the ancient barbarisms of college life. Female society throws around them its 
restraints, imposes its obligations, and compels a propriety and refinement of con- 
duct not so prevalent in male schools. As a matter of course the government of such 
schools is easier, their morals higher, and the esprit de corps more elevating. The 
forces of society are combined and act together, and, as a consequence, more satis- 
factory results are obtained. And while character is subtle—a something that can 
not be handled or seen—it stands to reason that a fuller and more symmetrical 
development will be secured when all the forces of social life are in harmonious 
action, than when any single element is wanting, and that better men and better 
women will be the outcome of our educational work.

L have twice written you in reply, but have repudiated both. The simple fact is 
that it is a line of school thought to which I have given little attention. My 
thought has been largely focused upon the other ways and means. I do not see any 
principle involved that experience sustains. I have always said that, theoretically, 
boys and girls in all grades at all ages should be at school together, but in experi- 
ence I do not see that it makes any difference in the hands of a first-class teacher. 
The Dwight school and the Gaston are as good schools as I know in the country. I 
do not see how they could be much improved if they were “boys and girls’”’ schools. 
I would never open a new school that was not mixed, but I see no call for a read- 
justment of the schools. :

NorMAL ScuHoo., Boston, May 4, 1890. 
I think all the teachers in the normal school agree with me in the opinion that it 
would improve the training school as such to introduce girls. It would give the 
normal pupils an opportunity to observe the modes ot discipline adapted to both 
boys and girls in a grammar school. Whether the change is practicable at the pres- 
ent time I am not prepared to say.

I should be in favor of having boys and girls in all grammar schools if there were 
schools in which the more vicious boys were required to attend. It is a serious 
question how far it is our duty to assist the vicious by association with the good. 
Iam pretty well satisfied in my own mind that the discipline of a school is made 
easier by the presence of both sexes. 
Larkin Dunron. 
Boys’ Latin ScHooL, Boston, June 6, 1890. 
On general principles and under ordinary circumstances I am not opposed to the 
coedueation of the sexes. Iam opposed to it in the Latin school. 
Several years ago a protracted and exhaustive hearing was given by the school 
board on this very question, so far as the Latin school is coneerned. A happy solu- 
tion of the question, as it has always seemed to me, was made by the school board in 
the establishment of a separate school for girls. 
The boys’ Latin school is large enough already. The schoolhouse is constructed 
for boys alone. Someof the work in the Latin school seems better adapted for boys 
than for girls. Ihave always had considerable sympathy with the objectors to the 
coeducation of the sexes in a classical course of instruction, though I do not con- 
sider their reasons as conclusive. Under the present peculiar and favorable condi- 
tion of the two Latin schools in this city, I should consider it unfortunute to have 
them united. 
‘Three teachers are in favor and eleven are opposed to the coeducation of the sexes. 
I understand that this expression of the teachers’ opinion is, in most cases, if not all, 
confined to coeducation in the Latin school, and not to the question in its general 
application. 
Mosrs MERRILL. 
Grrts’ High AND Latin ScHoots, Boston, April 25, 1890. 
To my mind coeducation in secondary schools is largely a question of balancing 
advantages against disadvantages, and so is to be viewed with favor or disfavor 
according to the local conditions under which it is tried. In towns and small cities 
having a substantially homogeneous population, coeducation works well in the 
main; for there the conditions approach in simplicity the conditions of family or 
neighborhood life. In large cities, however, the case is different. There-the popu- 
lation is not homogeneous, the families represented in the school are not known to 
one another, the numbers brought together in a single school are much larger, and 
the proportion of coarse natures among the pupils is apt to be somewhat greater. 
All this tends to make the question of morals and manners a more complicated one; 
and it is upor morals and manners—in other words, on the formation of character— 
thatthe question of mixed or separate classes, as it seems to me, chiefly turns. 
Now, evils in the domain of morals, though perhaps they occur no oftener in mixed 
than in separate schools, are more serious when they do occur there. As such evils 
can be dealt with more directly, more quietly, and with a nicer adaptation of means 
to ends in separate than in mixed schools, I am inclined to think that for large cities 
like Boston the former are to be preferred. 
Lam confident that,in such subjects as physics and civil government, boys are 
more appreciative, more alert, and more responsive. than girls, and the latter would 
unquestionably derive great benefit from association with the boys in the study of 
these subjects. 
In schools established for boys exclusively, the teachers seem to feel under the 
necessity of resorting to artificial means of stimulating their pupils to industry; 
whereas, in schools established for girls exclusively, artificial pressure is not only 
not helpful, but is positively injurious. It is difficult for me to believe that the sex 
which needs spurring and the sex which needs curbing should be trained together. 
Miss Shaw and Miss Foster, also three other teachers in our school, express their 
opinion that girls become intellectually more alert, and less passively receptiv 
associated with boys in the same classes, than when taught by themselves. 
Mr. Thurber nor Mr. Williston makes this observation; and I should not have 
thought of doing so myself as the result of my personal experience. As the result of 
my observation, however, I recognize the statement as true. This leads me to say 
that, other things being equal, I am inclined to think that girls are somewhat more 
responsive to the teaching of men than to the teaching of women.

COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 827 
Girts’ Hiau Scwoo1, Loston, April £4, 1890. 
I have had long experience in schools for the separate sexes and also in mixed 
schools. My cpinion is decided, that the advantages are, on the whole, on the side 
of the separation of the sexes in upper schools. 
The tastes, the natural tendencies, the ways of receiving the subjects of instruc- 
tion, the prospects of employment hereafter, all differ in the two sexes, and, whether 
he is aware of it or not, the teacher’s methods take a coloring from his environment 
and adapt themselves to the circumstances of the case, with wholesome results, so 
far as this is possible. Many things in high-school teaching take their shape from 
the conditions as determined by sex. Only as teaching grows mechanical does it 
come to concern itself less with individual and sexual characteristics. It is a great 
gain in any school when it can be so organized as to make the classes homogeneous 
in all the respects that determine the ways and means of instruction. It is an econ- 
omy not to have to consider the boys and the girls as needing somewhat different, 
but parallel, treatment in the same classes. 
Girls grow more reserved when boys are present, as do boys when girls are present. 
Something of naturalness has to be sacrificed when the sexes are mixed in secondary 
schools. Iam sure that many of the topics which girls choose to write their compo- 
sitions about, they would never take if they thought their exercises were to be 
heard by young men. They are tolerably free to write on domestic employments,’ 
cooking, sewing, kindergartening, and other such topics—the topics that really 
interest them. ‘Were boys in the classes, the girls would grow altogether conven- 
tional, and write without real personal interest, but only with the aim of avoiding 
the fate of becoming the objects of a smile. 
§. THURBER. 
CHARLESTOWN Hic Scnoon, May 5, 1890. 
I am in favor of mixed classes. 
My experience covers about twenty-one years in Boston schools, about equally 
divided between boys’ classes and mixed classes. 
‘This experience has convinced me that in mixed classes a better degree of schol- 
arship can be maintained, and that the discipline is better, more wholesome, and 
higher in tone. 
The life and spirit of a well-conducted mixed class is simply delightful to me, and 
there is the same satisfaction to me in the gentlemanly and lady like hearing of the 
pupils to each other, that I derive from the society of ladies and gentlemen in the 
world outside of school. 
I believe in mixed classes, because I believe in mixed teachers. 
I do not subscribe to the sentiment that teachers should all be men. 
Some of the best teachers I have ever known are women, and aside from their 
ability to teach, they exercise a most excellent influence. 
J am sure that boys and girls of the age of high-school pupils need the higher les- 
sons of character, of noble sentiment, of unselfish service which women are quite as 
ready to give, in their lives, as men. 
As I look back over my boy-life, I remember with gratitude the great influence of 
certain women as decided, as energizing, as directing, as that of any men who guided 
and assisted me; and I like to believe that in youth nature is much the same now that 
it was then, 
J. O. Norris. 
  Dorcuester Higu Scnoon, May 5, 1890. 
I am a decided believer in a commingling of the sexes in high schools. As to gram- 
mar schools, I have had no experience to which I can appeal, and hence have no 
opinion worth quoting. 
My observations are based upon a service of fifteen years in the English High 
School with boys alone, and some six years with mixed schools mostly in East Bos- 
ton and here. Atthe end of my term of service in the English High, if I had any 
opinions, they were, as to boys at least, in favor of separation. During these latter 
years, however, it has become increasingly clear to me that the work done and the 
faithfulness shown by the girls is on the average much superior to those of the boys. 
Now, this is not only a stimulus to the latter, but it sets a standard which is con- 
stantly on hand, to be appealed to by way either of rebuke or inspiration, while it 
silently exerts a leavening influence. Of course I am repeating only the truisms of 
the subject when I say that the association of young men and women tends to tone 
down many of the roughnesses of boys, to produce a refinement in manners, and, 
unconsciously to them perhaps, exerts a restraint valuable in its effects. These
-P-A-G-E-198

very effects have come under my direct observation as a teacher, while I recall the 
same influences as a boy myself in school. 
Moreover, I am sure that it is easier to maintain a proper degree of discipline 
with a commingling of the sexes. > 
The influence of the girls is almost always on the side of good order. I recall 
instances where the boys have scarcely dared to commit acts which alone they would 
not have hesitated to do, because the girls emphatically frowned upon them. The 
excellent influence exists not only in the intercourse of the school session, but in 
those ‘‘off” periods such as recess and before and after school. 
The benefit does not come wholly to the boys, however. In some lines the knowl- 
edge of the latter excels, particularly in practical matters such as mechanics and 
civil government, and frequently this tells in the class-room. That a certain man- 
liness and a smaller begetting of prudishness results in the girls I am quite sure. 
Perhaps, recollecting the faithfulness of the girls and, possibly, their fewer distrac- 
tions alone, they might go over more ground in text-books. Whether any bettér or 
healthier work would be done is fairly open to question. With girls alone I have 
no experience, and any opinion I may have is based on a priori consideration. 
Ihave never as yet been so unfortunate as to undergo any of those sinister expe- 
riences which have not been unknown in mixed schools, and so the optimism of my 
opinions is not dampened. 
The sentiments also of all the teachers in this school have been sought, and on 
the main question harmonize with mine. 
Cuas. J. LINCOLN. 
GRAMMAR SCHOOLS. 
  Joun A. ANDREW ScHOOL, May 5, 1890. 
This has been a mixed school from the beginning, but until within a few years 
the sexes have not been together in the same rooms except in the first class, From 
time to time the number of mixed classes has been increased, and the results have 
been such as to lead me to believe that coeducation is better, at least in the grammar 
schools. It follows the ordinary structure of the family and society, and is the way 
that three-fourths of all children are educated. 
In rural communities, from necessity this has been the custom, and certainly in 
morals, manners, and intellect the country child is the equal of the city child. It is 
confirmed by the habits and customs of daily life; they are together at home and out 
of school, and should be taught together in school. To educate separately is to 
change the order of nature. 
My experience tells me that it is best for the harmonious development of both 
sexes. In mixed classes each sex exercises a healthy restraint upon the other. Girls 
admire a manly boy and boys a womanly girl. And ‘‘ What the child admires, the 
youth endeavors, and the man acquires.” Mean actions, which with either sex alone 
might be applauded, would be frowned upon in a class of both sexes, and not 
repeated. ‘Thus the influence of each sex upon the other is healthful. Good disci- 
pline comes from evolution, not repression. Self-control is the key to success in 
school as in life. Coeducation begets self-control. 
To state briefly, coeducation is best because it is natural; it gives each sex the 
same opportunities; it cultivates the best in each; it develops self-control; it gives 
amore harmonious development. 
J. M. DILi. 
Bowpo1n Scwoot, April 28, 1890. 
Tam decidedly in favor of mixed classes. 
Because the family is a ‘‘ mixed class.” 
Beause each sex is a restraint upon the other, and in the right direction. 
Because the moral tone is higher when the sexes are together. 
Because knowledge will be gained in mutual daily work, which may be of great 
use in forming life unions. 
Because boys are awakened, refined, and given better ideals by coming into con- 
tact with the opposite sex under the watch and care of high-minded teachers. 
Especially will this be true if these teachers are of both sexes. I have long felt that 
an exchange of teachers should take place between the girls’ high and Latin 
schools, and the English high and public Latin schools. 
Because girls need to come into contact, during the formative period of their 
minds, with good, strong male teachers, in order to have a more complete develop- 
ment. The influence of a superior woman or man, acting alone upon the minds of
-P-A-G-E-199
  
    
COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES, 829 
youth, can give but a partial development of character. If both exert their influence 
during the same period, the most comprehensive and beneficial results will follow. 
In short, I would say the boys and girls would have higher ideals, would be more 
refined, more easily moved by sentiments of honor and respect, and would gain a 
more intelligent understanding of cach other, which might be of great use in after 
life. 
As our teachers do not seem inclined to write out their opinions, I venture to 
add some opinions of my first class girls. 
About two-fifths of them have been in mixed classes. All of these, with one excep- 
tion, think mixed schools are the best. The girl who did not agree said she went to 
school in the country where teachers were changed every term nearly, and the boys 
had things their own way. The girls, as a whole, are in favor of mixed classes. 
Only four voted in favor of keeping the sexes apart. Without asking leading ques- 
tions, these statements were made in favor of coeducation. The girls would try harder 
to get ahead of the boys. The boys and girls would be a restraint upon each other. 
Both would come cleaner, neater, and be more refined. One girl, who has not been 
excellent in deportment all the year, said she would behave better because her brother 
would report her at home, ete. 2 
Of course you will take these opinions for what they are worth. They were given 
with as much dignity and soberness as could be expected from young persons. I 
consider them weighty, though not conclusive. 
It seems to me that if children are to be separated, it should be done before and 
after school first. This would seem more reasonable, because while in school they 
are under the care of teachers who can restrain any improprieties. Besides, when 
engaged in school work their minds are withdrawn from sex distinctions. 
This battle concerning coeducation has already been fought out in Charlestown. 
It was fought a long time ago, when there were three grammar schools, one only being 
mixed. It was settled by putting both sexes in the other two. During my long 
residence in that part of the city I have never heard from any parent the wish, 
even, expressed that a return might be made to the old plan. 
These opinions are based on knowledge and experience gained outside of Boston 
in all grades of schools, from the ungraded country school to the well-graded city 
high school. Since I came to Boston I have taught two and a half years in a large 
boys’ school, twelve and a half in a mixed school, and four years nearly in the Bow- 
doin, which I am sorry to say has no boys. 
I have six children in the public schools of Boston, and I want them all to have 
the benefits of coeducation. 
ALONZO MESERVE. 
Bunker Hint ScHoon, 
It is natural for children to grow up together, and up to a certain age, say about 
13 years (or indeed so long as it is thought advisable to teach boys: and girls pre- 
cisely the same subjects), I think mixed classes preferable, especially in schools where 
there is no great difference in the moral standard of the pupils. But when the time 
comes in the ageof children, as I think it should come, that subjects are taught with 
some reference to their future employment, I think separate classes are preferable, 
in order to accomplish more (better results) in the same time. 
The committee has already recognized, in part, this difference in the needs of the 
sexes, by providing a course of sewing and cooking for the girls, and another one in 
carpentry, etc., for the boys. I would go somewhat further in this direction. I 
would make a difference in drawing, working in a less mechanical and more artistic 
course for girls than for the boys. Soin physics and arithmetic. The practical needs © 
of the housekeeper are unlike those of the mechanic and builder, and while general 
principlesshould be taught to each, the illustrations and applications should be 
largely adapted to future requirements. 
SamurEL J. BULLOCK. 
Gaston SCHOOL, April 22, 1890. 
I am not in favor of mixed classes. 
I have taught in mixed schools, in schools for boys only, and for the last year in a 
school for girls. 
After leaving a mixed school and taking charge of a boys’ school, I soon became 
convinced that the boys were more studious, more interested in their work, and made 
greater progress than they did when in competition with girls.
-P-A-G-E-200
  830 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Iwas so well satisfied of the correctness of my conclusions, that when I came to 
Boston as submaster of the Bigelow school, I very soon asked the privilege of -hay- 
ing boys only, and graduating them, leaving the girls to be instructed by themselves, 
My request was granted, and the boys immediately took equal rank with the girls, 
receiving—because they had earned them—as many medals at graduation as the 
girls; whereas never before had they taken more than half as many. 
The Lawrence and Lincoln schools soon separated the sexes in the same manner, 
with the same good results. 
‘The girls continued to do as well as before, thereby losing nothing scholastically, 
while the boys made great gain. : 
I have been a careful student of the subject, in regard to the effect on boys mor- 
ally, and I have failed to discover that the separation was in any degree demoraliz- 
ing; or that the boys were not as refined and gentlemanly as when taught in the 
same classes with girls. 
‘These opinions are confirmed by a twenty years’ mastership of a boys’ school. 
I have not been in a girls’ school long enough to have as definite opinions of the 
effect of separation upon girls, but as far as I can see they do not suffer in any respect 
by the separation. 
Tuos. H. Barnes, 
Hyper ScuHoon, April 23, 1890. 
After fifteen years’ experience as a teacher of mixed classes in high and grammar 
schools, and a longer experience in schools in which in the sexes were taught sepa- 
rately, Iam of opinion that, on the whole, it is better in high and grammar schools, 
in large cities, that the boys and girls be educated in separate schools. 
This has been the policy of the school board for many years. 
Our so-called mixed grammar schools have been two schools, one of boys and one of 
girls, in the same building. 
Rarely have boys and girls in large schools been taught together in the same room. 
Boys, as a rule, have graduated younger than girls. 
Girls give four hours a week to cooking and sewing in some classes. Many wise 
persons think more time should be given in school to fit girls for the peculiar duties 
of their station. 
They should not be disciplined or taught as if they were boys. 
They should not be subject to pressure such as is often good for boys. 
Important hygienic instruction can be given to girls or boys alone; nay, should 
often be given. 
The average mother fails, at the vital point, properly to instruct her daughter; 
therefore the teacher must not fail. 
Some sins against the body are crimes against the coming generations. 
If these sins are committed ignorantly, the results follow. 
A mixed school of young people in their teens ust be a nursery of ignorance as 
to some essential truths. 
Ithink more and better intellectual work is done in schools where the sexes are 
taught separately, and with less friction. < 
  8. C. Stonz. 
LIncoLn SCHOOL, April 22, 1890. 
Having tried both mixed and separate schools, I am still in doubt as to which is 
better. 
In the Lowell School I had boys and girls in the second class for two years, and 
then asked Mr. Jones to let me have only boys, which he did. 
My reason for asking for the change was that it seemed to me that the boys were 
somewhat cowed down in the presence of the girls and would not talk out as freely 
as when alone. Some of the quict girls seemed to be afraid, too. I found the change 
profitable. The boys when alone would discuss a subject, expressing their opinions 
more freely, where they had before confined themselves to facts simply. They 
seemed to grow more manly and independent. As a rule, I think boys in a boys’ 
school are more manly in many ways than in mixed schools. 
But mixed schools make discipline easier than boys’ schools and harder than girls’ 
schools. So that point balances itself. In a moral view, I do not believe it makes 
any difference, except in a few individual cases.

COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 831 
LOWELL ScHoon, April 22, 1890. 
For fifteen years I was principal of the Comins School, where the sexes were in 
separate rooms. In this school, seventeen years, we have had mixed classes. My 
experience leads mo to pronounce in favor of mixed classes, for the following rea- 
sons: 
1. The weak points in the character of the pupils of either sex are corrected by 
the presence of the other. 
2. The character of the boy is refined; that of the girl strengthened. 
3. The rudeness of the boy and the frivolity of the girl are restrained, and the 
mazners in both are elevated. 
4, There is no good reason why the good effects that flow from the mutual influ- 
ence of mingling the sexes in the family circle should not be looked for when we 
imitate nature in the school. 
5. Phere is no longer any doubt of their being able to go on together with the 
same work. 
6. I feel sure that the suspicion which some havo, that the character and manners 
of each may be injuriously affected, is not worthy of a moment’s thought. 
7. The members of a family going to the same school, haying the same master, and 
being governed by the same discipline, tend to peace and good feeling by all con- 
cerned.

Iam not in favor of mixed classes. As society is constituted in our cities, there 
are necessarily many children in our schools who are ignorant of the amenities of 
life, and others who are wholly indifferent concerning them. It is better that such 
pupils should be associated in classes with others of their own sex, in order that the 
improprieties of conduct may not demoralize the opposite. 
Tke citizens in general can have no conception of the manner in which many, 
many of the children live, whole families crowded together contrary to the laws of 
decency, so that the gross immoralities of the community become subjects familiar 
to the sight, and thus those witnessing them lose, in a great degree, the idea of their 
enormity. Things have transpired in my primary schools, even, that have led_me, 
when possible, to separate the sexes in the upper class. The argument that both 
sexes are reared together in the family loses its force when the family is made up of 
hundreds of children from as many different homes. 
My own experience when my children were in a mixed’school greatly strengthened 
my convictions on the subject. 
* Teachers for a boys’ school, peculiarly adapted to the work, would often be less 
successful with the other sex, and vice versa. In the proper conduct of a school lies 
the great success of the instructor. The teacher's ways must be agreeable to the 
pupils, their ideas must be in harmony in order to accomplish the best results, and 
I am thoroughly convinced that but very few teachers can be equally adapted to 
both sexes. 
Instruction in sewing and in manual training generally can be better arranged 
when the school is made up of one sex; and so with physical exercises, boys would 
enjoy and profit by many movements less suitable for girls. 
Young girls should not be subjected to the sight of corporal punishment as inflicted 
upon boysin mixed schools. I think parents are often deterred from sending daugh- 
ters (or should be) to the public schools on account of the punishment witnessed 
there. 
The personal preferences of boys and girls for each other, and the intercourse to 
which it leads, are detrimental to close attention to study. 
Ispent eight years as usher and submaster in the Mayhew school for boys, and, 
therefore, do not speak exclusively from the standpoint of a girls’ school.

I have been for many years one of the trustees of Antioch College, in Ohio. The 
system of the coeducation of the sexes was introduced in that college at its founda- 
tion, and has been continued ever since. I do not think that any person acquainted 
with the college would wish to change it. This seems to me a fair instance for your ~

purpose, because a large part of the students in this institution are connected with 
a preparatory school, which receives pupils at about the age of those who would 
attend high schools here. 
As is very well known to you, the practice of all the towns in the Commonwealth, 
excepting Boston, has always been to receive pupils of both sexes, whatever was 
their age. The old country academies thought of no other system, and are all organ- 
ized on that basis. 
I wish somebody would say why the Boston schools were ever organized on any 
other basis. I have paid a good deal of attention to our daily school education here, 
and I never knew. This is, however, certain, that Boston is the exception to the 
policy and habit of the Commonwealth for two hundred and fifty years. 
Epwarp Everett Hare. 
JAMAICA PLAIN, June 8, 1890. 
In my opinion the “coeducation of boys and girls in high and grammar schools” 
is a good thing for the boys and not harmful to girls. Most boys have much of the 
barbaric in them. The presence of and association with girls helps to humanize and 
civilize them. So far as the mere acquisition of knowledge and intellectual devel- 
opment are concerned, I do not think it makes any difference whether boys and girls 
are associated or separated. 
Yet, of course, the acquisition of knowledge and intellectual development are not 
the only things Yor which our schools are maintained. We want our boys to grow 
up gentlemen. The society and presence of girls is a powerful means to this end. 
As regards the attraction which each sex has for the other, which, I take it, is 
the supposed source of the evil that may arise from the coeducation of the sexes, 
I think the separation of the sexes has a tendency to lead to the very evils it is sup- 
posed to guard against. 
As a boy and youth I was in both kinds of schools, and that ismy judgment of the 
two systems. 
The male sex, whether young or old, is greatly benefited by association with the 
female sex; and so society as a whole is benefited. And to be a benefit to the body 
politic is, I take it, one purpose of the public schools. One of the most public sources 
of the degradation of Oriental countries is the separation of the sexes. 
I was three years in the army during our civil war, and could not help noting the 
baneful effect upon men of separation from the influence of women. There was a 
marked tendency to retrogade in all that has to do with refinement and the finer 
elements of our nature, 
Thus, you see, I believe in the coeducation of the sexes, for the sake ot the boys. 
Thold that it is in many ways helpful to girls; but not in such marked degree as 
to boys.

  61 CusHING AVENUE, Boston, April 29, 1890. 
Iam not aware that any institution that has tried coeducation has ever aban- 
doned it. I believe that in every case the results have been favorable. 
For'ten years I had the superintendence of the schools of a large town, so that I 
can speak from experience. 
‘There seems to be no more reason for an arbitrary separation of the sexes during 
school life than during the period before and after it. They are together in the fam- 
ily and mingle in sociéty, not only without harm, but to their mutual advantage. 
In the nature of things, boys and girls should be trained up together, since they are 
to live together as men and women, and need to be taught their true relationship. 
Separate schools for boys and girls are relics of a monastic age, when women were 
regarded as inferior beings. But in our day itis proved that woman has the capacity 
for the highest culture and ability to engage successfully in the various affairs of 
life. The sphere of woman has so enlarged that many avocations that formerly were 
held exclusively by men are now open to women, and women are pursuing them 
with success. Hence women, as well as men, need a broad and high education. 
But whilst coeducation offers equal advantages to both sexes, it does not compel 
a dead level of uniformity. Eclecticism is now dominant in the higher schools of 
learning. This elective system affords ample scope for choice of eounies to meet the 
special needs of women. 
Iam confident that the objection made to coeducation on moral mcnade has been 
proved to be groundless. 
The testimony from the schools where coeducation has been practiced is to the 
effect, that not only no harm comes from the mingling of boys and girls in the class- 
room, but that the results are positively good. Personal observation has led me to
-P-A-G-E-203
COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 833 
the conviction that coeducation is better for mind and morals than education of 
the sexes in schools apart. There is less rowdyism and more earnestness among 
boys, and less unlady-like conduct and fewer escapades among girls, in mixed than 
in separate schools. There is danger for the young of both sexes anywhere, but 
there is nothing gained and much lost by their separation in the class room. There 
one is both a stimulus and a restraint on the other. Jean Paul says, ‘‘To insure 
modesty I would advise the educating of the sexes together. But I will guarantee 
nothing where girls are alone; and still less where boys are alone.” Coeducation 
means a development of life into manly and womanly completeness.

I. It is a great stimulus to intellectual endeavor, promoting an ambition for suc- 
cessful scholarship. 
Il. It is also a very powerful inducement to the cultivation of habits of personal 
neatress, to a creditable demeanor and general refinement of manners. The very 
disparities of household training manifest in a public school are so exhibited in the 
school room where the prevailing mode of mind among the pupils is more observant 
and ambitious than elsewhere, that they powerfully plead for the better examples, 
and thus tend more to refine than to degrade. 
III. Such effects greatly aid the discipline and promote the general success of the 
school. 
IV. The evils incident to the inevitable association in life of weak or ill-regulated 
young persons of different sex would seem to be in a measure guarded against and 
held in check when that association is largely within the range of educational rela- 
tions, and is thus necessarily in a good degree guided by their elevating influences.

I know of no valid reason why coeducation should not be a universal and perma- 
nent feature of our common-school system. The separation of the sexes is detri- 
mental to both. It belongs to the very essence of free government and a Christian 
civilization that the sexes should be mutually respectful and mutually helpful (with 
proper supervision a school may be as innocentasa home), and this they can be only 
through a proper education together. The world moves forward, not backward. 
Coeducation is increasing in the higher institutions of learning. The coeducation 
ought to begin in the grammar school, and continue. Life isa coeducational school. 
I did not know that the question of coeducation was any longer debatable, at 
least as far as regards tho earlier stages of education. 
Prue 8. Moxom. 
I was so educated; I believe it to be the better plan; it has a tendency to take 
from the boys roughness and coarseness, and cultivate more gentlemanly deport- 
ment. 
In literary pursuits I can not see that anything is lost. 
Iam decidedly in favor of coeducation of the sexes. I had an experience of seven 
years, and that was the order then. 
The best class I ever had in Sunday school was a mixed class, and secured the best

I unhesitatingly record myself as in favor of coeducation of the sexes. I have 
two daughters in attendance upon the Everett School, and a young son in the Rut-

far as the girls are concerned, but believe it to be of incalculable advantage to the 
boys. And yet I am persuaded it is better even for the girls.

Iam a firm believer in coeducation of the sexes, in all grades from the kinder- 
garten to the university, also in professional schools. I am unable to understand 
why, in our educational institutions, we should adopt a principle of separating the 
sexes which does not obtain anywhere else in life. It seems to me that beneficial 
effects only are seen where the sexes are together, as in Cornell University, Ann 
Arbor, and the Meadville, Pa., Theological School.

I am entirely in favor of the coeducation of boys and girls in both grammar schools 
and high schools. 
In the West, where the first seven years of my life in America were passed, such 
coeducation was, I think, universal, and it was what I there saw of it which 
impressed it upon my mind as the best plan. It was a new thing to me, for, in 
England, coeducation beyond the infant school is almost unknown. 
BROOKE HERFORD, 
Arlington Street Church. 
Sourn Boston, May 18, 1893. 
Iam in‘sympathy with the plan of coeducation of the sexes. 
1. It is the plan of nature in the family. Boys and girls in the family together are 
a great blessing. 
2. I know how it worked at Antioch College, Ohio, where my father-in-law (a 
conservative) was president for seven years. 
He was a convert, I know (Rey. Dr. George W. Hosmer). 
3. [think more refinement of manners possible where boys and girls are in the 
same room and in the same recitations. 
We are too sensitive about the influence of social contact. Nature in the young 
(as a rule) promotes purity of manner, where all the conditions are elevating. Intel- 
lectual training in itself develops moral perception too. 
Witriam H. Savary, 
Minister of Unity Chapel. 
CHARLESTON, May 14, 1890. 
Ithink, on reflection, that the question of coeducation of the sexes in high and 
grammar schools admits of a variety of answers, according to conditions. 
1. Age of pupils: Up to ten or twelve years of age, children may safely and profit- 
ably be educated together. Whether in city or country, in bad or good neighbor- 
hoods, the benetit outweighs possible danger (always excepting the worst localities). 
I would keep the children together in grammar schools as long as the teachers 
think it best to do so, always seating boys and girls apart, but mixing them in reci- 
tations according to scholarship. 
2. In bad quarters of a city (where the state of moral and social life is low), 
when the pupils need much discipline, boys and girls may wisely be wholly sepa- 
rated in schools; also when some more respectable children are in the school. 
3. In high schools: (a) If a school is quite limited in numbers let the sexes study, 
recite, come, and go together. High schools generally draw pupils from the better 
classes of the people. (b) In large high schools the two sexes are better apart; each 
in a school by itself. 
Because (1) supervision on so many pupils is more difficult. 
(2) With each sex by itself, discipline can be better enforced when pupils are 
numerous, and study will be less interrupted. 
(3) Emulation is sufficient when many aro together without the additional stimu- 
lus of sex rivalry which, in a smaller school, keeps up the standard to some extent. 
(4) In large schools more danger of the influence of reckless pupils and teachers 
have less personal influence on individuals. 
4, The teachers can tell better than anyone else whether the conditions in any 
given school are favorable or unfavorable to coeducation. It is a subject on which 
general conclusions are theoretical rather than practical. 
5. Separate college education by all means. A. 8S. TwomBiy, 
Pastor Winthrop Church. 
ADDENDA.—Sex suceptibility affects students less than many suppose, when they 
are kept hard at work in schools. 
Boys and girls are generally shy of each other (except amoung the lower classes) 
between 14 and 19 yearsofage. Youths at that age segregate bysex. The question 
of coeducation at that period is more concerning its influence on effective study 
than as a matter of moral and social expediency.

  COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 835 
38 DarTMoUTH STREET, Boston, April 29, 1890. 
My opinion is not favorable to the coeducation-of the sexes in our grammar and 
high schools. Admitting its possible intellectual stimulus, I deprecate its effect 
upon morals. The objection does not hold with reference to coeducation in our 
colleges and universities any more than to our primary schools, but only to that 
class of our youth presumably between the ages of 13 and 17. Of course I concede 
exceptions to the rule, but, speaking in general terms, observation and experience 
would lead me to negative such a proposition as the one suggested. 
JAMES M. GRay, 
Rector First Reformed Espiscopal Church. 
Boston, May 2, 1890. 
In looking over the history of education it would seem that the coeducation of the 
sexes was a method which had been tried and discarded, and had long since passed 
out of the region of speculation. 
The stimulative influence of the competition created, which is claimed in its favor 
as one of its greatest advantages, can be shown, I think (though producing brilliant 
passing efiects), to be the cause of most disastrous final results. Competition in all 
directions is proving itself a most pernicious influence, and is being dropped from 
the highest methods of dealing in all departments of life. 
But nature seems to have answered the question for you most conclusively. 
Education is for two purposes: (a) The training of the intellectual capacity; (6) 
the fitting of the individual for a distinet work in life. 
On the question of intellectual capacity as between man and woman there can be 
no dispute. They are evidently created to be the companions of each other intellec- 
tually as in every other way. The only question is how to attain the best results 
with the mental power that is given. It seems hardly necessary to argue that the 
best possible intellectual results will be gained by subjecting two persons so physio- 
logically unlike to exactly the same laws and methods of training, just at a time in 
life when these differences demand the most careful recognition on both sides. 
Is it not because this point is not recognized that there is this constant restless- 
ness and agitation upon this very question? Recognize the needs of both, and not 
subject both boys and girls to virtually the same system, and we shall have more 
manly and more womanly intelligence in the affairs of life, and this question of 
coeducation can never arise. 3 
The same may be said also of the second purpose of education; women have a 
great special work for humanity assigned them which men can never perform. To 
its fulfillment woman’s whole nature, moral and physical, is most delicately adjusted. 
Upon her intelligent discharge of this task depends the whole fabric of family, 
social, and national life. For this a special training is as much needed to-day as it 
is almost universally neglected. There is nothing,in my opinion, more essential 
to the life of humanity than this distinct higher education of woman, which nature 
itself demands. 
These are some of my reasons for my opinion that there should not be a system of 
coeducation of the sexes beyond the very first rudiments of instruction. 
GEORGE J. PRESCOTT, 
Rector of the Church of the Good Shepherd. 
209 W. CANTON STREET, 
Boston, Mass., April 30, 1890. 
From the time that boys and girls are old enough for the grammar school until 
they are ready for college they should be kept apart. I was ‘‘coeducated” from the 
time that I began to go to school until I was graduated from Boston University, and 
Iam fully persuaded that free association during the time that I have indicated is 
fraught with danger to both sexes. ; 
GrorcE A. CRAWFORD, 
Pastor Broomfield Street M. E. Church. 
Soutu Boston, April 28, 1890. 
While I can bring forward no new argument, yet I feel that the old ones are suffi- 
cient to justify me in condemning coeducation. The argument of propriety is all 
sufficient in my judgment. There are dangers at an earlier period of life in our 
grammar schools; how much greater are not such dangers apt to be in high schools? 
And while I admit that youths may receive a stimulus to study, and, also, perchance, 
 
-P-A-G-E-206

a certain refinement, if you will, by coeducation, yet do I perceive also dangers 
which may more than balance such advantages. What these dangers are parents 
and educators and others experienced in affairs may easily surmise. In short, I 
havo no difficulty in condemning coeducation, and deem the separation, which now 
happily exists, the very best. > 
D. O’'CALLAGHAN, 
Rector St, Augustine’s Church. 
Boston, April 28, 1890. 
I would not educate the sexes together atany age. Adolescent appetite manifests 
itself rapidly between 14 and 18 years of age. 
The sedentary habit of long hours stimulates physical function. 
Familiar approach: of the morally unschooled, the nonreligious, and the actually 
vicious it is impossible wholly to prevent in coeducation. 
Pseudo-attachments are likely to spring up and pave the way to unfit ‘engage- 
ments” or afiiancings. 
The presence of the other sex is more or lessedistracting to application to the 
curriculum, In city life at best manhood and womanhood are stimulated to prema- 
ture ripening, especially in these days of flash novels and bare-legged theatricals, 
conditions different from the country school district. 
Consult that noble man and true Christian—whom I have long known personally— 
Anthony Comstock, as to your problem. 
The specious argument of the coeducation of the sexes in the home and the church 
needs but a moment’s examination. ‘The parent loves and guards : as a teacher does 
not. Kinship sanctifies as promiscuous commingling does not. Religion and posi- 
tive morals are present in the one case and w. holly lacking i in the other. 
It is the universal testimony that coeducation in colleges tends powerfully to loss 
of personal respect, except the young women virtually live like hermits. 
In my opinion the young sexes should first learn approach at home. There is a 
delicacy, a sweetness, a dignity, a refinement which a young girl, unfamiliar with 
tho society of the opposite sex, brings with her from the cloister when she ‘enters 
society” at a proper age. The experience of civilization, from feudal times to now, 
among the best social class is worth considering. 
Coeducation is democracy gone to seed. 
Emory J. HAYNES. 
JAMAICA PLAIN, Boston, May 1, 1890. 
1. It is seriously detrimental to the morals of boys and girls to place them 
together under such circumstances, particularly in the grammar school. 
Unless the teachers are persons of much wisdom and of strong influence for good 
over the pupils, vulgarity is an almost inevitable feature of the intercourse of the 
boys and girls. I have known cases where even under ordinarily good teachers the 
moral atmosphere of the school was vulgar in the extreme. Imect every day pupils 
of one of the largest grammar schools for boys in Boston, and one of the best situ- 
ated, with whom it would be impossible to associate girls without results most 
harmful to both sexes. The vulgarity and profanity is already deplorable and can 
not well be reached by any except the parents, many of whom, of course, have no 
desire to correct such things. 
2. The spirit of rivalry senerally excited between the boys and girls of the better 
class in the matter of studies is especially harmful to the latter. Girls ought not to 
be taught under the same methods as boys. There are periods when they ‘should be 
relieved from the burden of school work, and when the nature of the class work 
should be so changed as to give them the greatest possible variety, and the least 
possible amount of nervous wear and tear. 
Joun E. TUTTLE, 
Pastor Central Congregational Church, 
72 ALLEGHANY STREET, May 1, 1890. 
The following considerations are of influence with me as against any greater com- 
mingling of the sexes: 
1. Many of the children come from unregulated homes, and it is questionable how 
far other children should be compelled to hear and learn from unfortunate remarks 
and incidents, which arise from want of early discipline in every mixed class. 
As far as possible children should have the advantages of common-school educa: 
tion without risks.

2, The association of boys and girls in the same building, but not in the same 
classes generally, furnishes the best elements to be derived from some education of 
boys and girls, brothers and sisters in the same set of companions.

much less satisfactory work with the opposite sex or when they are mingled in the

Nonprofessional opinions. 
CAMBRIDGE, May 29, 1890. 
Iam very strongly in favor of the coeducation of the sexes. 
This opinion dates back to my early life, when, as a day scholar in what was then 
considered the best boarding school near Boston (that of William Wells, in Cam- 
bridge), I was struck with the greater decency and refinement of the day scholars, 
who lived at home and with their sisters, as compared with those who lived only 
among boys. Afterwards, as usher in another large boarding school (that of Stephen 
M. Weld, of Jamaica Plain), I noticed just the same superiority. This impression 
has never passed away from my mind. 
Since then, while on the school committee of three different places—Newbury and 
Worcester, Mass., and Newport, R. I.—I have seen the process of abolishing separate 
schools and bringing the sexes together; and always with satisfactory results as to 
discipline, manners, and morals. 
I am satisfied that there is in each sex an instinctive desire for the good opinion of 
the other, and that this isa very powerful aid and stimulus in the hands of the 
teacher. As a remarkably good teacher, Mr. William Reed, now of Taunton, said 
to me forty years ago at Newburyport: ‘‘I never yet saw a school which I could not 
manage by the waving of a finger, if I could only have boys and girls together.” 
‘This is now generally admitted as to boys; but there is often an impression that 
what the boys gain the girls lose. Here again I must quote a very able teacher, 
Mrs. Caroline C. Leighton, sister of the well-known educational authoress, the late 
Jane Andrews, and as good a teacher. When in Worcester, about 1855, we changed. 
her girls’ grammar school into a mixed school, she said soon after: “I was willing 
that the change should take place, because I thought we owed it to the boys, although 
I thought it would be bad for the girls. But now I am satisfied that it is for the 
benefit of both, and has done as much for the girls as for the boys.” 
When I was on the school committee of Newport, one of our very best grammar- 
school principals, a woman, took a day to visit Boston grammar schools. After her 
return she said to me, ‘‘ I should never wish to teach a public school in Boston. They 
seem to me perfectly tame and uninteresting, from having one sex only.” When I 
questioned her farther she said: ‘“Irely on my girls to give steadiness and regularity 
to my school; they are more punctual and get their lessons better. But Irely on 
the boys to bring outside life into the school, to know what is going on in the 
world, to illustrate the lessons from what happens in the streets and on the wharves. 
Neither would be sufficient alone; both are needed for the material of a good school.” 
I thought I had never heard the precise state of the case better put. 
THOMAS WENTWORTH HIGGINSON. 
    MILWAUKEE, June 8, 1890. 
In the West there has never been any doubt as to the feasibility or advisability of 
coeducation. In Wisconsin and Michigan both, this system has been fully in practice, 
and the University of Wisconsin gives equal privileges to both boys and girls. I 
have never heard of any difficulty or scandal arising from this intermingling of the 
sexes at school. 
I Was educated in such a school myself, and my experience teaches me that there 
is a certain emulation or desire to stand well in the eyes of the opposite sex, which 
stimulates thé pupils in such a school to greater mental exertion, and makes them 
more zealous in the pursuit of knowledge. Girls «re uswally quicker in their per- 
ceptions than boys of the same age, consequently boys derive the greatest benefit 
from this comradeship. Contact with the gentler sex also smooths the rough edges 
of a boy’s manner, and develops the chivalrous side of his character, making him 
more manly, more honest and straightforward than he would be if accustomed only 
to the society of boys like himself. There is still a good deal of the savage in man, 
and this trait is more likely to develop itself when men herd together. 
On the contrary, a girl who is brought up in the companionship of boys is more 
likely when she arrives at womanhood to estimate men at their true worth, and is 
less likely to become the prey of the first designing adventurer whom she meets.

Your inquiry strikes a Wisconsin man or woman somewhat as would an investiga-

the same pews in church. Coeducation has heen so thoroughly accepted and so long 
practised in the West, that we have to speculate as to the probable effects of a return 
to the old monastic system. 
Mrs. D. H. JoHNSON. 
In regard to the coeducation of boys and girls in high and grammar schools, I am 
entirely in favor of it, believing it to be for the advantage of both sexes to mingle 
freely in all departments of education. 
Ihave not hada very large personal experience, but have had under my care a boy 
and a girl who were passing through a coeducative highschool. Inneither case did I 
see any evil or disadvantage arising from coeducation; but on the contrary a natural 
healthy friendship with those of the other sex. I should entirely approve of the 
principle of coeducation, from the lowest primary school to the highest university or 
professional school. 3

PHYSIOLOGICAL AND HYGIENIC BEARINGS OF HIGHER EDUCATION FOR 
WOMEN WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO COEDUCATION. 
  Reference has already been made to Dr. Clarke’s book, Sex in Educa- 
tion. In the opening chapter the author discussed the physiological 
constitution of woman, and set forth conclusions which he had formed 
from clinical observation. In the fourth chapter he marshaled the 
“laws of development,” which he says “ we have found physiology to 
teach,” and his personal conclusions as an argument against coeduca- 
tion. With respect to the public discussions then in progress, the pith 
of the book was in this chapter, since it was immediately seized upon 
as presenting an unanswerable argument against opening to women 
institutions originally designed for men alone. 
The citation from this chapter, given below, is interesting as showing 
the manner in which Dr. Clarke applied his argument, and also the 
care with which he avoided open opposition to the general movement 
for the higher education of women, that had already become irresisti- 
ble. Against Dr. Clarke’s position little more could be adduced, at the 
time, respecting coeducation, than individual convictions. Mr. Hig- 
gimson, however, considerably lessened the effect of Dr. Clarke’s argu- 
ment by exposing the small basis of fact upon which it rested and 
pointing out, categorically, the classes of facts which were required in 
the premises and which, in his opinion, were already attainable. This 
portion of Mr. Higginson’s article, which formed a chapter in ‘‘Sex and 
Education,” is also reproduced. It should be added that the subse- 
quent investigations by the Collegiate Alumne Association were the 
natural outcome of this call for facts. The data collected related to 
the health history of 705 graduates from 12 colleges or universities 
open to women, 9 of the institutions claiming 247 of the graduates 
being coeducational.

under the direction of Hon. Carroll D. Wright, undertook the prepara- 
tion and publication of the material, and it is to be found in full as part 
v of the sixteenth annual report of that bureau. The summary of 
results which, under the circumstances, must be regarded as entirely 
impartial, is inserted here after the citation from Mr. Higginson. 
- Two years after this report was published the similar inquiry already 
noted was undertaken by a committee of women’s colleges at Oxford 
and Cambridge (England). These colleges are indeed not coeduca- 
tional, but this fact does not lessen the significance of the investiga-

tion so far as regards the strain of scholastic work, since the students 
are prepared for the same examinations as their brothers at Oxford and. 
Cambridge. 
The results of this investigation are presented in pamphlet report,

Sex In EpvucaTIon.

[Pages 121-127.] 
  Before going further, it is essential to acquire a definite notion of whatis meant, or 
at least of what we mean in this discussion, by the term coeducation. Following 
its etymology, con educare, it signifies to draw out together, or to unite in education; 
and this union refers tothe time and place rather than to the methods and kinds of edu- 
cation. In this sense any school or college may utilize its buildings, apparatus, and 
instructors to give appropriate education to the two sexes as well as ‘to different ages 
of the same sex. This is juxtaposition in education, When the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology teaches one class of young men chemistry and another class 
engineering, in the same building and at the same time, it coeducates those two 
classes. In this sense it is possible that many advantages might be obtained from 
the coeducation of the sexes that would more than counterbalance the evils of crowd- 
ing Jarge numbers of them together. ‘This sort of coeducation does not exclude appro- 
priate classification, nor compel the two sexes to follow the same methods or the 
same regimen. 
Another signification of coeducation, and, as we apprehend, the one in which it is 
commonly used, includes time, place, government, methods, studies, and regimen. 
This is identical coeducation. This means, that boys and girls shall be taught the 
samo things, at the same time, in the same place, by the same faculty, with the same 
methods, and under the same regimen. Thisadmitsage and proficiency, but not sex, 
as a factor in classification. It is against the coeducation of the sexes, in this sense 
of identical coeducation, that physiology protests; and it is this identity of educa- 
tion, the prominent characteristic of our American school system, that has produced 
the evils described in the clinical part of this essay, and that threatens to push the 
degeneration of the female sex still further on. In these pages, coeducation of the 
sexes is used in its common acceptation of identical coeducation. 
Let us look for 2 moment at what identical coeducation is. The law has, or had, 
a maxim that a man and his wife are one, and that the one is the man. Modern 
American education has a maxim that boys’ schools and girls’ schools are one, and 
that the one is the boys’ school. Schools have been arranged, accordingly, to meet 
the requirements of the masculine organization. Studies have been selected that 
experience has proved to be appropriate to a boy’s intellectual development, and a 
regimen adopted, while pursuing them, appropriate to his physical development. 
His school and college life, his methods of study, recitations, exercises, and recrea- 
tions, are ordered upon the supposition that, barring disease or infirmity, punctual 
attendance upon the hours of recitation and upon all other duties in their season 
and order may be required of him continuously, in spite of ennui, inclement weather, 
or fatigue; that there is no week in the month, or day in the week, or hour in the 
day, when it isa physical necessity to relieve him from standing or "from studying, 
from physical effort or mental labor; that the chapel bell may safely call him to 
morning prayer from New Year to Christmas with the assurance that if the going 
does not add to his stock of piety it will not diminish his stock of health; that he 
may be sent to the gymnasium and the examination hall, to the theaters of physical 
and intellectual display at any time; in short, that he dev elops health and strength, 
blood and nerve, intellect and life, by a regular, uninterrupted, and sustained course 
of work, And all this is justified both by experience and physiology. 
Obedient to the American educational maxim that boys’ schools and girls’ schools 
are one, and that the one is the boys’ school, the female schools have copied the 
methods which have grown ont of the requirements of the male organization. 
Schools for girls have been modeled after schools for boys. Were it not for differ- 
ences of dress and figure, it would be impossible, even for an expert, after visiting 
a high school for boys and one for girls, to tell which was arranged for the male and 
which for the female organization. Our girls’ schools, whether public or private, 
have imposed upon the pupils a boys’ regimen, and it is now proposed, in some 
quarters, to carry this principle still further by burdening girls after they leave

840 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
school with a quadrennium of masculine college regimen; and so girls are to learn 
the alphabet in college as they have learned it in the grammar school, just as boys 
do. This is eroundel upon the supposition that sustained regularity of action and 
attendance may be as safely required of a girl as of a boy; that there is no physical 
necessity for periodically relieving her from walking, standing, reciting, or study- 
ing; that the chapel bell may call her as wellas him toa daily morning walk, with a 
standing prayer at the end of it, regardless of the danger that such exercises, by 
deranging the tides of her organization, may add to her piety at the expense of her 
blood; that she may work her brain over mathematics, botany, chemistry, German, 
and the like, with equal and sustained force on every day of the month, and so 
safely divert blood from the reproductive apparatus to the head; in short, that she, 
like her brother, develops health and strength, blood and nerve, intellect and life, 
by a regular, uninterrupted, and sustained course of work. All this is not justified, 
cither by experience or physiology. The gardener may plant, if he choose, the lily 
and the rose, the oak and the vine, within the same inclosure. Let the same soil 
nourish them, the same air visit them, and the same sunshine warm and cheer them: 
still, he trains each of them with a separate art, warding from each its peculiar 
dangers, developing within each its peculiar powers, and teaching each to put forth 
to the utmostits divine and peculiar gifts of strength and beauty. Girls lose health, 
strength, blood, and nerve, by a regimen thatignores'the periodical tides and repro- 
ductive apparatus of their organization. The mothers and instructors, the homes 
and schools, of our country’s daughters would profit by occasionally reading the 
old Levitical law. The race has not yet quite outgrown the physiology of Moses. 
SEX AND EDUCATION. 
A Repry To Dr. Epwarp H. Criarkn’s Sex iy Epucation. 
Articlo by THomas Wrxtworrn Hicarnson, pp., 35-44. 
  It has been pointed out, again and again, in the Woman’s Journal and elsewhere, 
that there are whole classes of facts to be had bearing most closely on this question 
which neither Dr. Clarke nor any physiologist opposed to coeducation has yet 
attempted to obtain. Instead of shrinking from these facts, we are constantly beg- 
ging for them. Until they are obtained, systematized, and displayed, the whole 
eument of Dr. Clarko has but an insufficient basis of facts. They are such as 
these: ¥ 
1. Wo need facts as to the comparative physiology of American women in differ- 
ent localities. There are highly educated communities and very uneducated 
communities. Has Dr. Clarke, or any one, compared the health of women in cities 
and in country towns; in cities with good schools and cities with poor schools; or 
in highly educated States like Massachusetts and Connecticut, as compared with 
States where the climate is similar but the school system less thorough? The 
standard of female cducation is not very formidably high in Pennsylvania, where 
they also havo an equable climate, no east winds, and most comfortable living; and 
yetone of Dr. Clarke’s severest statements as to female debility (p. 112) comes from 
Pennsylvania.! In country villages I could name, where there are only very poor 
district schools, kept for less than half the year, the traveller constantly observes, 
among the farmers’ daughters, cheeks as pale and vitality as deficient as in the best 
educated metropolis. 
2. Again, we need facts as to American-born women of different races. Dr. Ciarke 
says of a century, “that length of time could not transform the sturdy German 
friulein and robust English damsel into the fragile American miss.” (P.148.) How 
does he know it could not? I havo seen this change very nearly effected in a single 
generation among the children of English, Ivish, French Canadians, and even the 
Nova Scotians; whom he so praises; and this in families where even reading and 
writing were rare accomplishments. As far as I can observe, the effect of climate, 
change of diet, change of living, on all these classes, is almost sure to produce the 
same result of delicacy, almost of fragility, in the second generation, with or with- 
outschooling; and among the boys almost as much asamong the girls. A physician 
in a large manufacturing town once told me that the unhealthiest class of the com- 
munity, in his opinion, consisted of the sons of Irish parents. 
  1“ Today the American woman is, to speak plainly, physically unfit for her duties as woman, and is, erhaps of all civilized females, the lesst qualified ‘to undertake those weightier tasks which tax so eavily the nervous system of man. She is not fairly up to what nature asks from her as wife and mother. How willshe sustain herself under the pressure of those yet more exacting duties which now-a-days she is eager to share with tho man?” (Wear and ‘Tear, by S. Weir Mitchell, M. D., of Philadelphia, quoted in 1873.)      
   
 
-P-A-G-E-211
    
COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 841 
8. We need also the comparative physiology of different social positions. Asa 
rule, the daughters of the wealthy in America, who are sent to private schools, or 
taught by governesses, are fur less severely taxed as to their brains than the daughters 
of the middle classes who go to the public schools. Is Dr, Clarke prepared to show 
that those of the former class are decidedly more healthy? If so, this is another 
point that would have a direct bearing on hisargument. My own impression is that 
he would find it hard to prove this. 
4, But there is still a fourth class of facts, only to be obtained by an extensive 
record of individual instances. Letting go all discriminations of locality, race, and 
social position, and looking only at individuals under similar conditions, is Dr. 
Clarke prepared to assert that as a rule, it is the hardest students in the school who 
become invalids? He would say, on a priori grounds, that it must beso. Butdo 
facts show it? Looking over families and schools that I have known, I certainly 
can not say that the young girls who havo lost their health were the moststudious— 
quite as often the contrary. I have asked teachers of wide experience, ‘“ Haye you 
observed that your best scholars have furnished the larger proportion of invalids?” 
and they have always said ‘‘No.” Yet who that knows the affection with which 
teachers are apt to follow the later career of their pupils will deny that this evidence 
has much value. Here is a fourth class of facts which have a direct bearing upon 
the subject, and the ignoring of which weakens the value of our author’s statement. 
5. Lam struck with the further point that Dr. Clarke seems to have entered on his 
inquiry in the spirit of an advocate, not of a judge, and fo have taken absolutely 
no account of the physiological benefits of education for women. There certainly 
are many instances—all teachers have known them—of great benefit to health, in 
case of girls, under the stimulus given by study. Either Dr. Clarke knowa such 
instances, or he does not. If he knows them, he is bound to state them in such an 
argument; and, if possible, to arrange and tabulate them, in order to set them 
against the instances on the other side. If he does not know them, it simply shows 
that, while the facts of disease impress the physician, the facts of health may elude 
hin.   
“ SUMMARY OF RESULTS OF A SPECIAL INQUIRY INTO THE HEALTH OF 
FEMALE COLLEGE GRADUATES, BY THE ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGIATE 
ALUMNZE. 
[Sixteenth annual Report of the Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics of Labor, pp. 528-532.] 
Referring briefly to the results as shown by the tables, it appears— 
That the graduates are largely of American parentage; that the greater part of 
them spent their childhood in the country and had a fair amount of out-door exercise 
daily. 
That 57 per cent began study in a school and 41 per cent at home, the remaining 2 
per cent failing to answer; that the average age at which they began study was 5.64 
years; at entering college, 18.35 years; at graduating from college, 22.39 years; and 
that the average present age is 28.58 years. 
That during college life the majority studied but moderately ; that 44 per cent did not 
worry over their studies or affairs; that they were generally regular as regards hours 
for eating and sleeping, took a proper amount of physical exercise daily, and, as 
regards nearly one-half of them, abstained from exercise wholly or in part during the 
menstrual period; that, as arule, they entered society but little, and for the most part 
had college roommates. 
That since graduation all seem to have found congenial occupation, a great many 
as teachers, while 8 only are occupied with social duties to the exclusion of other 
occupation. 
That about one-fourth have married, and that of the whole number of children 
born by them, the greater part are living and in good health. 
That, for all the various periods of their lives, the health of over three-fourths 
of the graduates has been either excellent or good; that during college life a slight 
falling off from excellent or good health is apparent, resulting in an increase in 
number reporting fair health, while, on the other hand, the number reporting indif- 
ferent or poor health is smaller than for any preceding period, and but slightly in 
excess of the number reporting the same conditions of health for the succeeding 
eriod or since graduation. 
That over onv-half of the graduates are not and have not been troubled with nery- 
ousness, and that nearly 25 per cent have had no trouble at any timo during the 
menstrual period. 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
842 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  That about 60 per cent have had some disorder; the more common disorders 
reported relating to the stomach, liver, bowels, lungs, nervous system, generative 
organs, neuralgic and rheumatic affections, and, to a certain extent, to the heart and 
brain. 
That the most prevalent cause of disorders is constitutional weakness, the other 
causes being bad sanitary conditions, intellectual overwork, emotional strain, and 
physical accident. 
‘That the varying conditions of childhood, as shown in the comparison tables, 
haye had no marked influence for good or evil upon the present health of graduates. 
‘That the present health of graduates seems to have been affected according as 
their parents have enjoyed either good or poor health, the figures showing 3 per 
cent increase in the health for those whose parents were both in poor health. 
That so far as inherited tendency to disease is concerned, a decline in health has 
also taken place, as compared with the average good health of all the graduates, 
those inheriting tendency to disease from either parent showing a decline in health 
of 3 or 5 per cent, those inheriting tendency to disease from both parents of nearly 
20 per cent, while in the case of those who have no hereditary tendency to disease, 
there has been an increase of nearly 3 per cent in good health. 
That during college life about 20 per cent show a deterioration in health, 60 per 
cent no change, and 20 per cent an improvement; that for those who entered college 
at 16 years of age and under, an increased deterioration in health of between 10 and 
11 per cent as compared with those who entered at a later age is observed, and of 
over 8 per cent as compared with the whole number whose health deteriorated. 
That during life there was nearly 2} per cent less deterioration in health as com- 
pared with the deterioration in health reported during working time by the working 
girls of Boston, : 
That those who studied moderately show an increase in health of over 3 per cent 
as compared with average good health during college life for all graduates, while 
those who studied severely or moderately to severely show a decline of from 5 to 7 
per cent as compared with average health during college life. 
That, as compared with average good health during college life for all graduates, 
those who worried over personal affairs, a decline in health of over 10 per cent; those 
who worried over both studies and affairs, a decline in health of 15 per cent, while 
those who worried over neither studies nor affairs, show an increase in health of 10 
per cent. 
That for those graduates who studied severely during college life, as compared 
with the average good health of all graduates, a decrease in health of 7 per cent at 
time of entering college is shown; during college life a decrease in health of over 5 
per cent, and since graduation of exactly 6 per cent; that if, on the other hand, the 
health of these graduates at time of entering, during college life, and since gradua- 
tion are compared with each other, without regard to the health of all the graduates 
for the three periods, there was a decrease in health during college life-of less than 
2 per cent, an increase in health since graduation of three-fourths of 1 per cent as 
compared with health at time of entering college, and of over 2} per cent.as com- 
pared with health during college life, and finally, 
That although the average good health of these graduates who studied severely was 
considerably less than the average good health of all the graduates for the three 
periods considered, their health did not suffer material deterioration during college 
life, and has more than recovered since graduation its normal state at time of enter- 
ing college. 
The facts which we have presented would seem to warrant the assertion, as the 
legitimate conclusion to be drawn from a careful study of the tables, that the seek- 
ing ofa college education on the part of women does not in itself necessarily entail 
a loss of health or serious impairment of the vital forces. Indeed, the tables show 
this so conclusively that there is little need, were it within our province, for extended 
discussion of the subject. 
The graduates as a body entered college in good health, passed through the course 
of study prescribed withowt material change in health, and since graduation, by 
reason of the effort required to gain a higher education, do not seem to have become 
eS to meet the responsibilities or bear their proportionate share of the burdens 
of life. 
It is true that there has been, and it was to be expected that there would be a cer- 
tain deterioration in health on the part of some of the graduates. On the other 
hand, an almost identical improvement in health for a ike number was reported, 
showing very plainly that we must look elsewhere for the causes of the greater part 
of this decline in health during college life. If we attempt to trace the cause, we 
find that this deterioration is largely due, not to the requirements of college life 
particularly, but to predisposing causes natural to the graduates themselves, born 
in them asit were, and for which college life or study should not be made responsible. 
A girl constitutionally weak is always at a disadvantage, and naturally would suffer
-P-A-G-E-213
  COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED. STATES. 843 
a deterioration in health, temporary possibly, or even permanent, if, at the most 
trying period of her life, from 18 to 22 years, she seeks superior education. At the 
same time we should not fail to emphasize the fact that fully 30 per cent of the 
total deterioration in health during college life was from excellent to good only. In 
the case of those graduates who studied severely even, the facts reported eoncern- 
ing their physical condition do not show that they have suffered materially from the 
effects of close application, but that they have since graduation returned to the 
normal condition reported by them at the time of entering college. 
In conclusion it is sufficient to say that the female graduates of our colleges and 
universities do not seem to show, as the result of their college studies and duties, any 
marked difference in general health from the average health likely to be reported by 
an equal number of women engaged in other kinds of work, or in fact, of women 
generally without regard to occupation followed.

Summing up the results of our investigation, we may, I think, say with confidence 
that there is nothing in a university education at all especially injurious to the con- 
stitution of women or involving any greater strain than they can ordinarily bear    
-P-A-G-E-214
844 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
without injury. Women generally pass through it without its affecting their health 
one way or the other. As was to be expected, however, some improve in health and 
some deteriorate, both improvement and deterioration being sometimes the effect of 
conditions of college life and of circumstances more or less connected with it, though 
probably more often due to constitutional or other causes for which college life can 
not be either praised or blamed. The net result of the change is that as large a 
proportion of the women who have had a university education enjoy good health 
now as did so at the time they entered college, while the number in poor health, 
among those who have read for honors, is somewhat reduced. These results contirm 
those of the similar inquiry previously conducted in America. 
As mothers of healthy families we have seen that the students are more satisfactory 
than their sisters, and so far as we can judge quite up to the average of women. 
We have set down as a fact unfavorable to a university education for women, a 
temporary falling off during college life of about 5 per cent in good health as com- 
pared with either health at entering or present health. This to some extent depends 
on illness or other things occurring accidentally during the college course, and»to 
some extent is probably due to the relaxing climate of our universities; but itis also 
partly caused by overwork and want of attention to well-known laws of health, and 
to this extent both could and ought to be prevented by reasonable care on the part 
of students themselves. 
That any serious alarm as to the effect of university education on the health of 
women is groundless is clearly shown by the fact that the net amount of increase 
in good present health, as compared with health between 14 and 18 years of age, is 
greater in the case of students than of their sisters. 
In 1874 Prof. Fairchild, of Oberlin, wrote as follows: 
“A breaking down in health does not appear to be more frequent with women than 
with men. We have not observed a more frequent interruption of study on this 
account, nor do our statistics show a greater draft upon the vital forces in the case 
of those who have completed the ful! college course. Out of 84 who have graduated 
since 1841 7 have died, a proportion of 1 in 12. Of 368 young men who have gradu- 
ated in the same time 34 are dead, or a littlemore than1lin1l. Of these 34 young men 
6 fell in the war, and leaving out those the proportion of deaths remains 1 in 13. 
Taking the whole number of graduates, omitting the theological department, we 
find the proportion of deaths 1 in 9}; of ladies 1 in 12, and this in spite of the lower 
average expectation of life for women, as indicated in life-insurance tables.” 
The Boston School Document already cited (No. 19, 1890) presented 
the opinions of 49 physicians of that city, of whom 30 favored coedu- 
cation, two of the number with some reservations, and 19 opposed the 
policy. The following citations present substantially the special argu- 
ments advanced by this class of professional men. 
OPINIONS OF PHYSICIANS. 
[From Boston School Document No. 19, 1890.] 
  16 UNION Park, Boston, April 30, 1890. 
I consider the coeducation of boys and girls in grammar and high schools not only 
permissible, but highly beneficial to both sexes. 
First. I consider it of moral importance that the influence of the boy and the girl 
upon each other should be exercised from earl) uth, so that each sex would become 
familiarized with the other’s way of thinking, speaking, and feeling. 
Second. Such an influence would materially strengthen the health through the 
intellectual discipline produced, while the physical condition of the girl would nec- 
essarily be improved through the association with the boy, because she will be less 
likely to hurry on nervously with her studies; the intellect of the boy being some- 
what slower in its development, the girl will find in the boy’s nature a wholesome 
counterpoise; thus to both boy and girl will be assured a slower and more thorough 
advance in study, and more time either for physical rest, physical development by 
culture in plays and games, or outdoor recreation. This latter is sadly lacking in 
girls’ schoo]s, as usually the ambitious pupils and their teachers strive simply for 
one object, namely, to be equal to, or in advance of, the boys’ schools. The result 
too often produced is an early ripeness of intellect without a corresponding ripeness 
of physical conditions.

COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. ~ 845 
Roxpury, April 29, 1890. 
1. My personal experience of coeducation has been favorable. It was the method 
pursued in the public schools of Brookline, where I was brought up, and in the high 
schools of which I subsequently taught. I believe it has advantages over the sep- 
arate system, and in schools representing the well-to-do middle classes of society I 
see no objections to it. 
2. The only considerable argument against it, that girls require at certain periods 
special exemption from work for physiological reasons, falls through when, even 
though the sexes are separately educated, yet the standard for both sets of schools 
is identical, so that no indulgence can be, or at any rate is, granted the girls over 
what is given to the boys. : 
8. I am inclined to think that in certain localities of large cities where the social 
and moral tone is very low, and teachers have no aid from parents in restraining 
pupils out of school hours, coeducation might be open to some objections on the score 
of morality.

It seems to me there are three general questions to be considered: first, the effect 
upon the health; second, the effect upon morals and manners; and, third, the effect 
upon the mental training and development. I am unable to find any conclusive evi- 
dence that the morals of either sex are vitiated by coeducation, and I believe that 
the manners of the boys and young men are improved. It seems the natural way 
that the two sexes should be educated together, at least so far as the grammar and 
high schools go. In the family where there are boys and girls, both sexes seem to 
develop more normally. To be sure one hears of grave moral deflections happening 
occasionally among school girls or boys; but this does not prove, it seems to me, that 
the coming together, as they do in mixed schools, is the cause of it; is not the true 
cause, rather, bad outside influences and the neglect of wholesome home influences? 
I have been a teacher in a mixed high school myself (the Cambridge High) and IL 
bave talked with others who have been connected with mixed schools in one way or 
another, and from our experience we can find no evidence of any general lowering 
of the moral tone, and the single cases which have occurred are not proven to have 
been the result of coeducation. Looking at it from a purely medical and physiolog- 
ical side, one has to consider this question: Is it prejudicial to'the normal develop- 
ment of either sex to bring them together at school at and after the age of puberty? 
Puberty is a critical time with both sexes, perhaps more so with the girls; then itis 
that the nervous system has to be especially guarded from overexcitement; then it 
is that the girls are likely to be morbid, etc. The home influence ought to be the 
guarding and guiding hand which safely brings the boy and girl through this 
period, and with tolerable care at home I can not see how the bringing together for the 
comparatively short time of the school hour will act injuriously on either sex. On 
the contrary, may it not obviate those morbid tendencies so common to the age of 
development? 
Lastly, there is the question of partial rest once a month for the girls at the men- 
strual epoch. Is not this an objection to the mixed systems? Will not the girls feel 
compelled to do the same work at such times as in the intervals, to their injury and 
suffering? The girls are, as a rule, more ambitious than the boys, and do more 
work, and can afford to relax a few days each month and still keep up with the 
boys. Of course, just what should be each girl’s plan as to work during these times 
must bedetermined by hersensations and feelings, together with wise advice at home, 
if possible. Here also I believe morbid conditions are less likely to arise if, as in a 
mixed school, less attention is attached to this physiological function. 
As to the mental training and development, I believe it makes very little if any 
difference in the results whether the boys and girls are educated separately or 
together; this so far as the purely school work is concerned. In addition, however, 
with coeducation, I believe, as I have mentioned, that the manners of the boys are 
improved; they learn to be more gentle, and the girls learn some ‘‘robuster virtues.” 
While writing this I have had the opportunity to speak of the matter with Prof. 
Sedgwick, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and from his experience in 
mixed grammar and high schools, and in his own department at the institute, he 
quite emphatically concurs in my opinion.

846 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
138 BOYLSTON STREET, Boston, May 15, 1890. 
At the age when the most of the pupils of our high schools—and the same might 
apply to a certain extent to the grammar schools—are sent there, the natural func- 
tions of the adolescent organism are undergoing more complete development, and 
the person of either sex is passing from the period of childhood toward that of matu- 
rity, or at least of perfect development; and certain functions which have lain dor- 
mant until this time are awakening into life, and arouse new and unknown sensations 
and emotions. There is also at that time an increased need of careful and appropri- 
ate training, of judicious restraint over the associations and surroundings, both 
moral and physical, which form the environment of the individual. The boys of 
our community are at this time more restless than heretofore, and often traits of 
character of new and sometimes uncontrollable nature are developed. To a certain 
extent this is also true of the opposite sex. 
The high schools take their pupils from various districts of the city, and often 
from out of the city, and these pupils are thereby removed from the influences 
which have thus far surrounded them; they are brought into association with other 
boys or girls whom their parents can not know, and often they are exposed to influ- 
ences which parents or guardians would strive to protect them from if this were pos- 
sible. Iamina position to speak from experience, and I think that vast harm is 
done to many pupils in the high schools from the mingling of boys frongso many 
directions, and I have seen many, many cases of impairment both of health and 
character which are traceable to this cause. This was not long ago illustrated in a 
most alarming manner among the pupils of Eton, and I could mention examples in 
our own city. If, now, the membership of our higher schools were made up of both 
boys and girls, I can not think that the absence of knowledge on the parents’ part 
of the associations which might be formed between the individuals of such a homo- 
genous collection of pupils would operate to the detriment of educational ends, 
and would not infrequently cause great misfortune. In an institution which I have 
visited, in which the education of the pupils of 15 to 20 years is carried on in com- 
mon, I was told by one of the teachers that great trouble is experienced in the reg- 
ulation of the relations between the pupils, and that often very embarrassing situ- 
ations are encountered. 
For these reasons, and others which I do not think it necessary to mention in this 
inquiry, I would express the opinion that coeducation of the sexes in our higher 
schools or in the grammar schools is not, under existing circumstances, either judi- 
cious or advisable. 
ALBERT H. BLopGert, M. D. 
Vinws or COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS AND PROFESSORS, WITH ACCOUNTS 
ov SPECIAL PROVISION FOR THE HIGHER EDUCATION OF WOMEN, ESTABLISHED 
IN CONNECTION WITH UNIVERSITIES. 
  [Dr. F. A. P. Barnard, president Columbia College, New York, N. Y. Report of 1879.] 
Expediency of receiving young women ts students.—The condition of the college is now 
such as.to justify the suggestion of the question whether its advantages should not 
be open to young women as well as to young men. This question has been brought 
to the attention of the trustees heretofore by outside parties, and the reception which 
it met has been such as to indicate that the minds of the board are not favorably 
prepossessed in regard to it. There has been hitherto, however, no room for con- 
sidering it upon its merits; for whether regarded favorably or not, so long as the 
college was confined within recent narrow accommodations the measure has been 
impracticable. Not that the admission of young women requires any considerable 
provision of space greater than that which is necessary for young men only; but 
that, in arriving at and leaving the building, they need their separate retiring rooms 
and cloak rooms, and no apartments could be found in the old building suitable 
for this purpose. That difficulty no longer exists. The measure has become prac- 
ticable. There can be no harm in inquiring whether it is not also expedient. 
Many considerations suggest themselves which make inits favor. In the first place, 
there can be no doubt that among many of our most judicious thinkers, and possi- 
bly with even a majority, there exists at this time a profound conviction that, in 
the interests of society, the mental culture of women should be not inferior in char- 
acter to that of men. The condemnation of that kind of female education which in 
past years has been too prevalent, in which the useful has been made subordinate 
to the ornamental, and what are called accomplishments have taken the place of 
solid acquisitions, is all but universal. The demand has been made and its reasona- 
bleness has been generally conceded, that the same educational advantages should 
be offered to young women which young men enjoy. But when the question is
-P-A-G-E-217
  COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 847 
raised as to how that demand shall be met, there is no longer found to prevail the 
same unanimity. 
One obvious method is to improve the female schools. Of such institutions there 
are, and have always been, a sufficient number; but the fault of most of these is 
that they furnish the merely superficial and ornamental education of which com- 
plaint is made. Such can not be improved except by reconstruction, for their 
instructors can not rise above their own level, and their proper level is indicated by 
the teaching they have been accustomed to give. 
Another method is to create colleges for young women identical in form with the 
existing colleges for young men, embracing in the scheme of instruction the same 
subjects in the same order, and conferring at the end of the course the same aca- 
demic degrees. Examples of this kind of institution are seen at Vassar College, in 
this State, and at Rutgers Female College, in this city. The objection to these is 
that they can not, or, at least, in general, will not, give instruction of equal value, 
though it may be the same in name with that furnished to young men in the long- 
established and well-endowed colleges of highest repute in the country, and that it 
is unjust to young women, when admitting their right to liberal education to deny 
them access to the best. * * * * * * * 
In more than half the colleges of the United States young women are admitted 
on the same terms as young men, and attend the same instructors in the same lec- 
ture halls at the same hours. The usage is more general in the Western than in the 
Eastern States. But we have two conspicuous examples, the Cornell and the Syra- 
cuse universities, in our own State, and there is one in Massachusetts, the Boston 
University, and one in Connecticut, the Wesleyan. Yale College admits young women 
to her School of the Fine Arts. In the Michigan University, which, in numbers and 
in standing, ranks among the leading educational institutions of the country, out 
of a total of more than 400 in the School of Letters and Science, between 70 and 80 
are young women. ‘The colleges of the country, excluding those under the control 
of the Roman Catholic Church, are, according to the latest enumeration, 355 in num- 
ber, of these 183 are open to students of both sexes. 
In many of these colleges the students are permanently resident, separate build- 
ings being provided for the female students. The Sage College at the Cornell Uni- 
versity, founded by the liberal friend of education whose name it bears, is asplendid 
edifice erected for this purpose. In others, as at Syracuse, the students of both 
sexes, with few exceptions, attend at the college only during the day, and out of 
class hours reside at home or in private families. This arrangement relieves the 
instructors of responsibility for general supervision and leaves no room for the occur- 
rence of troublesome questions of discipline. 
As to the practicability of adopting this plan in our college, no question will be 
raised; but doubts may be entertained as to its expediency. It would be difficult, 
nevertheless, to suggest any reason which will bear very close examination why it 
should not be adopted. The admission of young women into the classes would not, 
in any manner, interfere with and embarrass the processes of instruction as they are 
now conducted. No modification of the arrangements of the class rooms would be 
necessary. So many more units would simply be added to the number and so many 
more names to the class roll. In every scholastic exercise the young women would 
be regarded as the young men are regarded—merely as students. 
It can not be denied that there is, in some minds, a feeling of aversion to this 
proposition which does not seek to defend itself by reasons, but inclines those who 
entertain it to dismiss the subject without argument. This is probably owing prin- 
cipally to the fact that the admission of young women into colleges isan innovation 
upon immemorial usage. The spirit of conservatism never fails to rise up against 
novelties, no matter how cogent the arguments by which they may recommended. 
That it is this spirit mainly which opposes the opening of colleges to women, rather 
than anything inherently objectionable in the proposition itself, is made quite evi- 
dent by the fact that no such opposition manifests itself to the association of stu- 
dents of both sexes in the academies and high schools with which the country 
abounds, many of which profess to teach the same subjects asthe colieges, to the 
same extent, and to pupils of similar ages, differing chiefly in the fact that they have 
not a determinate course of four years, and do not confer degrees in arts. 
The opposition to the proposal which has its souree in the feeling here referred to 
is no doubt the most serious of the difficulties in the way of its adoption, simply 
because feeling is not controlled by judgment, but remains often unchanged after 
the understanding is convinced. Objections are, however, sometimes made to the 
plan which appeals to the reason. Thus, there are those who hold that the average 
female intellect is inferior in native capacity to that of the stronger sex, and hence 
infer that the association of the sexes in the same classes will have a tendency to 
depress the standard of scholarship. It is unnecessary here to go into the general 
argument upon this point, for it is not in the effort to master those elementary facts  
-P-A-G-E-218
848 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  of knowledge or principles of science which form the material and the instrument 
of early mental training that the relative ultimate strength of different minds can 
be tested. There is in some intellects a quality of activity, of quickness of percep- 
tion and readiness of combination, which, within given limits of time, is more than 
a compensation for more slowly moving power. And this is a quality which 
observation has proved to be peculiarly characteristic of the female mind. Similar 
observation, moreover, has pretty well established that, as a rule, girls are more 
diligent in study than boys, a fact which has an important influence on the record of 
their scholarship. 
The experience of institutions where this point has been practically tested proves, 
moreover, that the presence of young women as members of college classes tends to 
a result directly the reverse of that which the objection supposes, and has the effect 
to raise rather than to depress the average scholarship of the classes to which they 
belong. Inregard to this matter, the results derived from a comparison of the record 
made in Cornell University during the years preceding and the years following the 
opening at that institution of the Sage College for women, which have been kindly 
furnished to the undersigned by Vice-President Russcl, are exceedingly interesting 
as well as instructive. 
In order to understand the significancy of these it is necessary to bear in mind 
that in every college a larger or smaller proportion of the matriculates of a given 
year usually drop off before the close for a variety of reasons, among which are 
failure of health, failure of means, the disciplinary acts of the faculty, and loss of 
position in consequence of defective scholarship. All these causes, except the last, 
are pretty uniform in their operation; and, with the same exception, the effect of 
all of them united is never very considerable. The variations, then, in the total 
magnitudes of the losses, when successive years are compared with each other, must 
be mainly due to the operation of the cause last mentioned, the varying numbers 
who fail from deficient scholarship. 
Now it appears that at Cornell University, during the years which preceded the 
admission of young women, the losses during the year averaged 26 per cent, or 
more than a quarter of the entire number of the matriculates, per annum, while for 
the seven years that have passed since that date the losses have averaged only 16 
per cent per annum. During this latter period the standard of attainment for 
admission has been twice raised, and the term examinations have been made 
steadily more and more rigorous. Either of these causes might have been supposed 
likely to increase the proportion of losses, yet no such effect has followed from both 
ot them together. It has been added in a statement by an officer of the University 
recently printed that ‘these seven years have witnessed a marked improvement in 
the quality of the whole institution,” and further, a very noteworthy fact, that 
during the entire period ‘‘no young woman has been dropped from the rolls through 
failure at examination.” So as the experience of this institution is concerned, 
the evidence is quite conclusive that the admission of young women as students 
into college classes has the effect to raise rather than to depress the standard of 
scholarship. 
Another objection to the plan is found in the assumption that the course of study 
prescribed in colleges is too severe to be attempted without danger to the delicate 
constitutions of young women. This proposition has been elaborately maintained 
by an eminent authority, whose views have had a wide circulation, and have, to 
some extent, impressed the public mind. So far as these views are founded on a 
priori consideration, they are mere opinions, to which the opinions of other authori- 
ties no less weighty may be opposed. So far as they are founded on observation of 
injurious results presumed to have followed from overtasking the physical powers 
by excess of study, it would be easy to demonstrate by similar examples that the 
course of college study is too severe for young men as well. 
But this argument, if it proves anything, proves too much. It is not the kind of 
study which harms, if study harms at all, either young women or young men, it is 
the quantity; and certainly, valueless as the teaching in many young women’s 
“finishing schools” may be, it is usually heaped up upon its victims to an extent 
not inferior to that which the college course requires. It is inconceivable that the 
exercise of the mind upon the solution of an algebraic problem, or the interpretation 
of a passage in Homer, can be more exhausting than a similar exercise over the 
French irregular verbs, or ever’ so much so as the confinement of hours daily in 
bending wearily over the drawing table or drumming on an ill-tuned piano. The 
argument of the objector, however, begs the whole question by assuming that this 
is really the case, while his opponent might reply that if he has proved anything he 
has simply proved that young women ought not to be educated at all. 
Of course no one will contend that excess of study can not but be injurious to the 
young of either sex. If young women in college commit this error they will suffer 
for it, and so will young men. We see examples of this kind occasionally in the 
youth of our own college, but however we may regret these, we do not consider it 
    
-P-A-G-E-219
COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 849 
  advisable to discourage young men from entering college on that account. Could it 
be proved that the studies taught in college offer to young women a more dangerous 
temptation to excess than those which from the substance of the nore ornamental 
education they have been heretofore accustomed to receive, the fact might suggest 
the propriety of greater vigilance to arrest this tendency, but it certainly could not 
justify us in cutting them off from these so fascinating studies altogether. 
There is one consideration bearing on the plan in question which is positively 
favorable, and is not without importance. The presence of young women in colleges 
is distinctly conducive to good order. Nothing is more certain than that the com- 
plete isolation of young men in masses from all society except their own tends to 
the formation of habits of rudeness, and to disregard of the ordinary propricties of 
life. No degrec of good breeding, no influence of social refinement in the family 
cirele, can effectually secure a youth against this danger. It is this which explains 
the frequent participation of young men in college in acts which in other situations 
they could not be induced to countenance, and would even regard as reprehensible. 
Any circumstance, whatever it may be, which destroys this isolation, and subjects 
the youth to the wholesome influences which protect his moral tone in the ordinary 
environment of society, can not but be beneficial. Such is the effect of the presence 
of women in college. On this point the undersigned is able to speak with tho 
authority which belongs to knowledge experimentally acquired. As an officer of 
the University of Alabama, it was his custom for years to invite the attendance on 
his lectures of classes of young women from a neighboring female seminary, and 
others resident in the town of Tuscaloosa. The advantageous effect of this upon 
the manners of the young men was a subject of common observat:on, and the results 
were so satisfactory that the example was followed by other officers of the same 
institution, so that scarcely a day passed without the presence of young women in 
one or another of the college classes. These were not matriculated students, it is 
true, and they did not directly mingle with the young men, but this circumstance 
tended rather to diminish than to increase the influence which their presence exerted, 
and yet this influence was very decided. 
The elder Silliman, during the entire period of his distinguished career as a pro- 
fessor of chemistry, geology, and mineralogy in Yale College, was accustomed every 
year to admit to his lecture courses classes of young women from the schools of New 
Haven. In that institution the undersigned had an opportunity to observe, as a 
student, the effect of this practice, similar to that which he afterward created for 
himself in Alabama, as a teacher. The results in both instances, so far as they went, 
were good; and they went far enough to make it evident that if the presence of 
young wonien in college, instead of being occasional, should be constant, they would 
be better. 
But it is still objected that though the association of young women with young 
men in college may be beneficial to the ruder sex, it is likely to be otherwise to the 
gentler. The delicacy and the reserve which constitute in so high a degree the 
charm of the female character are liable, it is said, to be worn off in the uncere- 
monious intercourse of academic life, and the girl who enters college a modestly 
shrinking maiden is likely to come out a romping hoiden or a self-asserting dog- 
matist. Those who make this objection argue rather from assumed premises than 
from any facts of observation. It is sufficient to say that the experience of the high 
schools of the country fails to furnish ground for this impression, and that no such 
results have been observed in any of the numerous colleges in which the experiment 
has for years been tried. 
There is another and final objection less frequently urged in these discussions than 
those above enumerated, yet probably often in the minds of those who do not urge 
it, which is founded on the supposed disturbing influence which sentimental causes 
may exercise over the spirit of study. If young people of both sexes are associated 
in the samo institution, and thus permitted to meet frequently and familiarly, their 
thoughts, it is imagined, will be likely to be more constantly occupied with each 
other than with their books. An appeal might here again be made to experience to 
show that this danger is exaggerated. Andit might besaid with justice that the 
comparative freedom of schoo] intercourse tends far less to excite the imaginations 
of impressible youth, and clothe for them the objects of their possible admiration 
with unreal charms, than do the more constrained and less frequent opportunities of 
mutual converse afforded in general society. 
But, however that may be, the argument is inapplicable to the circumstances of 
our particular case. Here no opportunities for intimate intercommunication exist 
atall. The students attend only during a limited number of hours daily, and dur- 
ing their attendance they are constantly in class and occupied either in listening to 
instruction or in the performance of their own scholastic duties. No common halls 
of assembly exist, in which they may gather either before the exercises of the day 
commence or after they are over. From their retiring rooms, which will be entirely 
cut off from every other part of the building, the young women will pass directly to 
ED 93: 54       
     
-P-A-G-E-220
  850 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
the lecture room, and at the close of their daily tasks will retire in the same way. 
Throughout the entire duration of the college course they will be resident in their 
own homes and surrounded by every protecting safeguard that parental solicitude 
can provide. If itis really desirable that the educational advantages offered to 
young women should be equal to those which young men have been so long permitted 
to enjoy, it would seem to be neither reasonable nor right that they should be excluded 
from the institutions where such advantages exist. Ifit is not desirable, of course 
the argument falls to the ground. 
The measure here under consideration, should it meet with approval, would not 
robably be productive of any immediate visible effect. Few young women would 
es likely to present themselves as candidates for admission within the next few 
years, because there are few in this community who are likely to have given atten- 
tion to the studies required as preparatory to the college course. But after that 
period, in a great city like this, a very considerable attendance might be anticipated, 
and thus our college would enter upon a new and important field of usefulness. 
Whatever may be the fate of the present suggestion, the undersigned can not per- 
mit himself to doubt that the time will yet come when the propriety and the wisdom 
of this measure will be fully recognized; and as he believes that Columbia College 
is destined in the coming centuries to become so comprehensive in the scope of her 
teaching as to be able to furnish to inquirers after truth the instruction they may 
desire in whatever branch of human knowledge, he believes also that she will 
become so catholic in her liberality as to open widely her doors to all inquirers 
without distinction either of class or sex,

In my opinion, the coeducation of the sexes in high and grammar schools, as also 
in colleges and universities, is absolutely essential to the best results in the educa- 
tion of youth. 
I believe it to be best for boys, best for girls, best for teachers, best for taxpayers, 
best for the community, best for morals and manners and religion. 
At the time of the opening of the Boston Latin School for girls, I pleaded as hard as 
Icould in favor of the opening of the then existing Latin school to both sexes, 
instead of starting a new and separate school for girls. Since that time I have 
seen no reason to change my views. So far as I can judge, Boston would do wisely 
to repair the mistake, and to organize all her schools on the plan followed at 
Cambridge, and in so many intelligent and prosperous cities.

It seems to be divinely ordained that boys and girls should be brought up together 
in the same family; and no good reason is apparent to me for separating them 
at the school-room door. Both mentally and morally they are mutually helpful in 
stimulating and in restraining each other, and therefore necessary to a symmetrical 
development of character. Any so-called reform which forbids coeducation in our 
grammar and high schools is what Dr, Bushnell would call a ‘Reform against

  COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 851 
Drury CoLiucE, Springfield, Mo., May 10, 1890. 
Our instittittion is coeducational, and the preparatory department is of the same - 
grade as the high school; but the conditions are peculiar, in that we have a lady 
principal who has charge of the young ladies who live at the college, and who, with 
the other teachers, maintains a general supervision. Our regulations are not exces- 
sively strict by any means, nor do we have any restrictions upon the social relations 
of the students beyond those which good sense and regard for proprieties suggest. 
Coeducation presents no peculiar difficulties with us. It is taken as a matter of 
course. Its effect upon the manners of the students is, I think, good. Occasionally 
an intimacy springs up which is disadvantageous, but I am by no means sure that 
such incidents are more freauent than would be found to occur among young people 
differently cireumstanced. On the other hand, I am inclined to think thatthe daily 
association of young people of both sexes, under wise teachers, may be helpful in 
the way of correcting much that would be false in thought and imagination. 
As regards class-room work, physical strength, intellectual capacity, etc., I seeno 
difference. There are bright boys and dull boys, and there are bright girls and dull 
ones. Occasionally a girl shows the effect of overwork, and occasionally the same 
thing is seen among the boys. It is a matter of strength, endowment, etc., rather 
than of sex.

So far as I have observed the working of the coeducation of the sexes in high

nary caution be observed, but the competition of boys and girls in the same classes 
has usually been productive of intellectual activity. 1 do not think that the danger 
of immorality is increased by the meetings incident to well-regulated* instruction

852 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  Onto STATE UNIVERSITY, Columbus, Ohio, May 10, 1890. 
An experience of twenty years has convinced me that for nine-tenths of college 
students education of the sexes together is better than the education of them sepa- 
rately. The presence of those of the opposite sex is a stimulus in study and a 
restraint in conduct. The frivolous and foolish will be frivolous and foolish under 
either system. 
Ihave no special knowledge of high schools and grammar schools to justify an 
opinion concerning coeducation in them. 
W. H. Scort, 
President of the University. 
VaAssak COLLEGE, May 13, 1890. 
As a member of a school board in an Eastern city, I was accustomed to schools in 
which boys and girls were educated together, but where, during the recesses, there 
was an absolute separation of the sexes. I never saw aught in these schools to call 
for unfavorable comment. 
In our high school a similar law was enforced, only there was a considerable sepa- 
ration of the sexes in classes as well. But in many lines of study they worked 
together, and without unfavorable comment. 
I see no objection to sucha plan. The expense of a separate system makes it 
impossible in most places, nor does it seem at all imperative on other grounds. But 
Iam sure it is necessary that boys and girls of the age of most of those in our higher 
schools need careful watching where they are thrown so indiscriminately together. 
One or two may poison a large number, and necessarily our schools must include 
every kind.

I am opposed to coeducation in colleges, but have never studied the question as it 
relates to high and grammar schools, and do not consider myself entitled to express 
any opinion.

I consider the coeducation of boys and girls in high and grammar schools objec- 
tionable. 
Tra REMSEN, 
Acting President, Johns Hopkins University. 
MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, 
Boston, June 3, 1890. 
T have never taught in high or grammar schools, but after thirteen years’ experi- 
ence can speak in terms of unqualified approval with regard to coeducation in 
higher grades. 
I was educated in a school and college where none of the other sex were admitted, 
and naturally was of the opinion that such a course was not desirable. When com- 
pelled. to admit ladies to my classes I regarded it as a mistake, and endeavored as 
‘ar as possible to keep them apart, and only with great anxiety, and by slow degrees, 
permitted any intermingling in the class-room. 
The results obtained have been so advantageous that now I have thrown off all 
restraint in the class-room and laboratory, and subject all students to exactly the 
same discipline and rules, no attention being paid to sex, but the students arranged 
alphabetically and in every respect treated alike, and I am satisfied that coeduca- 
tion can be carried on successfully, provided all artificial barriers are swept away; 
and the nearer we come to this the better will be the result. 
There are natural advantages from the mingling of the sexes, and the strongest 
argument against it isa moral one, which, however strong it may be out of the 
schoolroom, loses its force in it.

COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 853 
Ann ARBOR, MICH., August 22, 1890, 
In every respect salutary. Our young men are better behaved on the whole— 
more gentlemanly. 
In some subjects the women surpass the men; in others the opposite is true. On 
the whole, I do not think our standard has declined. The university has certainly 
made great strides forward since women were admitted, in 1871. This is, of course, 
due toa variety of causes; but I do not believe that the women have in any way 
retarded the onward mov ement. In some respects they have certainly facilitated it. 
Isaac N, Demon. 
The objections against coeducation in colleges, as far as they relate to the effects 
upon women, are discussed as follows (in Education, January, 1893) by Dr. J. L. 
Pickard, ex-president of State University, lowa City, Iowa: 
Before proceeding to a discussion of the question it is proper that coeducation be 
defined. ‘The well-nigh universal practices of Western colleges and universities will 
define the term with sufficient clearness. 
Young men and young women are invited to pursue their studies together in the 
college, as has been their custom in the high school and academy. They are sub- 
jected to an identical examination for admission. They are required to choose from 
many courses of study offered them. When choice is mado they attend upon the 
instruction of the professors at the same hour, and of course in the same class room, 
Requirements as to attendance, to preparation, to examinations are identical, They 
pass from year to year upon the same basis of scholarship. They have equal oppor- 
tunities for winning scholarship honors. They graduate upon the same day, present 
their theses upon the same platform, and receive diplomas entitling them to enjoy 
the privileges of the same degrees. 
The objections made to coeducation in colleges are entitled to respectful considera- 
tion. 
(1) Sex manifests itself in the intellect no less than in the bodily structure and 
functions. ‘To ignore sex in educational processes is against nature and must result 
in disastrous failure. Let it be admitted. Is any psychologist wise enough to draw 
the line of demarkation, and to assign these studies as proper to the female mind 
and those to the male? When the attempt is made shall we not find many studies 
upon each side of the line? Will not similarities exceed differences? The opening 
of pursuits and professions to women within the last few years has brought into 
clearer light what is common to the sexes and differences are less prominent. 
The modern coeducational colleges recognize the differences and provide varied 
courses of study. The influence of sex will determine the choice made. In some 
feminine minds there may be a masculine element which will affect the choice. The 
same may be true upon the other side. Will the friends of separate schools ignore 
nature and presume to correct what they claim to be abnormal? 
The objection proceeds upon the theory that all courses of study are constructed 
with solereference to the masculine mind. The days of the “trivium” and the “‘ quad- 
rivium ” are long past. nee, literature, and art present more than seven roads 
to a degree. No two applicants need pursue the same road in all its windings. 
There is ample range for the demands of sex in education. But is it best that these 
demands be met in their entirety? Because there is sex in education, coeducation 
claims candid consideration. In the economy of nature each sex has its place, not 
in studied separation and exclusion, but in mutual strengthening and restraint. 
‘And in no direction is the influence of sex stronger or more complementary than in 
that of mental culture. Female colleges of the higher grade recognize the fact in 
the sometime selection of male presidents and male professors. Male colleges do not 
as yet reciprocate. Ifit be true that formative forces are the better w here strength 
and grace are combined, who will claim that these forces emanate solely from ‘the 
teacher’s rostrum? The daily mingling of students furnishes the opportunity for 
the exercise of subtle yet powerful influences in tho formation of character. ‘This 
leads to the consideration of a second objection. 
(2) Womanly virtues are endangered by the greater familiarity which coeduca- 
tion permits. President Porter expressed the thought when he said, in advocating 
woman’s education, that he wished it to be in ‘‘ womanly ways.” The “womanly 
way,” as I understand it, is in the line of sacred and refining influence upon our 
social life. This power, like all others, gains strength by constant exercise. How 
can it be cultivated when opportunity ‘for its exercise is denied. Man, too, needs 
training in manly ways. But the manly way is that of refined strength. Does the 
seclusion of the boys’ college bring grace to movement, polish to manners, purity to 
thought, refinement to strength? Many of us who were shut out from real society 
during a college course can recall many scenes where awkwardness or boorishness 
has brought a blush of shame to the cheek when returned to real life in the presence 
      
   
-P-A-G-E-224
854 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  of our sisters—an awkwardness by no means relieved in the presence of those who 
for the same number of years had learned of man only through glimpses obtained 
in the occasional party or in the sensational novel, in neither of which does the 
true man appear. 
Sex in education? Yes. Itis God’s plan. He will give it all needed force. It 
requires no stimulus, such as separate schools emphasize. Its action must not be 
reflex. For this reason I would urge the fact of sex in education as an argument 
for coeducation. Where will one find more manly men and more womanly women 
than in a family of brothers and sisters under the guidance of a loving father and 
mother. ‘‘That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth, that our daugh- 
ters may be as corner stones polished after the similitude of a palace.” 
The family is the unit of society. The home is designed to be the citadel of vir- 
tue. If God’s purpose be attained it will only be through the union of strength and 
grace in the makers of the home. Why take away from either sex the opportunity 
to form a thorough, a rational acquaintance during the years wherein such acquaint- 
ance is ripening into a life companionship? As well attempt to teach astronomy in 
a@ windowless room, or botany in a paved city court, as to expect the starlight of 
pure love or the flowers of sincere affection to reach the hearts of those who touch 
each other’s lives only in formal society, or who know nothing of each other’s char- 
acter except as gathered from occasional meetings when society demands studied 
restraints of the real self. 
Let each sex test the other’s strength in the class room and respect for real worth 
will take the place of sentimentalism. Acquaintance will be formed upon the higher 
lane. 
x Those experienced can tell of the happiness of a married life, the road to which 
lay through the class room, society halls and contests for intellectual supremacy 
which a coeducational college afforded. 
Observation in coeducational work for nearly fifty years since my graduation war- 
rants me in declaring the well-nigh universal happiness of those who have formed 
their life attachments during a period of study in coeducational institutions. 
Indeed, of married classmates or college mates I recall no instance of unhappy 
results. 
Not many years since the opponents of opening a boys’ school to the girls of the 
same city, based their opposition upon the injury to the moral character of the girls 
by permitting them to occupy the same class room with their brothers and the 
friends of their brothers. The natural inference must be that girls are too weak 
morally to withstand the temptations of male society, under the restraints of the 
best teachers both male and female. Such an argument is an insult to the girls or 
a stigma upon their brothers. 
If I could so far forget my experiences, or so far shut out the light of observation 
as to entertain even the shadow of a suspicion that coeducation can in the least 
degree prove prejudicial to public morality or to womanly refinement, I would raise 
my voice loudly in favor of entire separation of the sexes in all our colleges. Says 
Ruskin: “The soul’s armor is never well set to the heart unless a woman’s hand has 
peraeed it, and it is only when she braces it loosely that the honor of manhood 
fails. 
There remains one argument having greater weight with many than either of 
those thus far considered. 
(3) Woman’s physical nature demands a difference in treatment as to hours of 
study; as to times of physical exercise and the character of such exercise; as to 
regularity and uniformity of tasks assigned. Undoubtedly true. But give to the 
plan of coeducation its legitimate development—place in professional chairs, with- 
out distinction in salary, representative men and women and these differences will 
be recognized and dangers will be averted. 
After all the danger is more apparent than real. A woman will study as a man 
does and will control the circumstances attending her. A woman will pursue her 
studies in a woman’s way. Attempted prescription will end in disastrous failure. 
No two men pursue exactly the same methods in attainment of knowledge, as stated 
near the beginning of this article. A wide opportunity for choice is given, and it is 
but reasonable to suppose that woman regards her physical nature in making her 
choice. She has also had due regard to her future. 
Can it be proven that woman’s health is not endangered under the processes of 
coeducation ? 2 
A few years since the following facts were obtained from President Fairchild, of 
Oberlin, which was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in America. During 
a given period of years under review, he ascertained that of 84 female graduates 7 
had died, 8} per cent. For the same period of 368 male graduates 34 had died or 9} 
per cent. So much for those who have entered active life after graduation. What 
can be said of those in the active pursuit of study? A school of 600 pupils ranging 
in age from 14 to18 years—the majority girls—furnishes from its records the fact
-P-A-G-E-225
  COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES IN THE UNITED STATES. 855 
  that absences caused by ill health were for a year 1 per cent less in case of female 
than of male pupils, though the distance traversed varied from half a mile to 7 miles 
each day. 
In Scien young women bear off their full share of honors. Herein says Dr. 
Edes in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal of March 9, 1882, the danger threat- 
ens woman. ‘ What we are to name that impelling force which drives on the girl 
to pursue her studies with a tireless sort of energy it is not easy to say. It seems to 
be a compound of conscience, ambition, and a desire to please in varying propor- 
tions with a peculiar feminine sort of obstinacy, which in a better cause and reason- 
ably directed would demand admiration rather than pity. A boy of moderate abil- 
ity even with some ambition to do well is apt soon to realize his true position and 
content himself with such moderate scholastic honors as are easily within his 
reach. * * * In this he has an immense advantage over his sister, that he real- 
izes at an early age that many avenues are open to him toward success, and in only 
a few of these is high scholarship of any advantage whatever.” 
Admitting this to be true, it isan argument in favor of coeducation since it is 
reasonable to suppose that the excessive sensitiveness of the girl will be checked in 
contact with the indifference of her brother educated at her side. But Dr. Edes 
would not be quoted as attributing the evils he depicts to coeducation, for he says 
further on: ‘‘On looking over my case books I have been surprised to find the same 
statements repeated again and again, namely, that the sufferer had taken the high- 
est honors at some noted female college.” All the cases he cites from his own practice 
have but few references to school life, but these few are to female seminaries. The 
same journal of November 24, 1881, gives a table of valuable statistics prepared by 
Dr.Tuckerman, of Cleveland, Ohio, for which the assistance rendered me by Dr. Lin- 
coln, of Boston, is gratefully recognized. These statistics prove the futility of the 
argument under consideration. 
For physical reasons it is certainly not good policy to cultivate in woman that 
*impelling force” which Dr. Edes finds it so difficult to define, and which his case 
book traces to ‘‘female colleges.” Now is it well to encourage the indifference of 
the young man. If these tendencies are inherent in sex, might it not be best for both 
sexes that they be brought into mutual action, and that excessive sensitiveness be 
checked somewhat in its contact with too great indifference? 
Separate schools quite naturally emphasize the tendencies of sex. 
The presence of girls in my own class at the preparatory school gave me an inspira- 
tion, which was gradually lessened in power during my college course, when boys were 
my only classmates—boys over whose minds indifference gained gradual power as 
their years of exclusion advanced. 
Ifno good argument can be adduced against the policy of coeducation in colleges, 
with either a psychological, physiological, or moral basis; and ifit be agreed that 
under the present plan of organization young men and young women may be edu- 
cated together as well as in the separate schools—then one strong plea may be made 
for coeducational colleges on the seore of economy. Duplication of all essential 
equipments—libraries, laboratories, apparatus of a material nature—and of the 
sources of living inspiration within professional chairs can hardly be justified. 
EXPERIENCE OF COEBDUCATION AT BROWN UNIVERSITY, PROVIDENCE, R. I. 
[Annual Report of the President, June 29, 1893.] 
The educational privileges which the corporation at its meeting last June extended 
to women have been very welcome. Ten women have been pursuing studies in the 
graduate department the entire year, and the number of regular candidates for 
undergraduate examinations has been 39. All those who passed the freshman exam- 
inations last year are continuing their studies. Of the regular candidates for this 
year’s freshman examinations there are 14. The remainder of the young women 
making up the 39 are not at present candidates for any degree, though several of 
them will become such. The scholarship of all is remarkably high, averaging a 
good percentage, better than that of our men students, The considerable number 
of women candidates for undergraduate examinations has induced some gentlemen 
in the faculty to institute means for a systematic preparation for these examina- 
tions. Classes are formed in all the branches elected, and they are instructed by 
the same men who have charge of the corresponding classes inside the university. 
There has thus-sprung into existencea woman’s college, technically and legally 
under the university only so far as its examinations are concerned, yet in effect a 
department of the university, so closely connected are examinations with the instruc- 
tion therefor, * * *
-P-A-G-E-226
856 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
     While this establishment makes no drain whatever upon the university’s financial 
resources, it adds greatly to its popularity and favor with the community. From 
present prospects another year will find no fewer than 100 women pursuing studies 
in connection with the university, either as full members of it, viz, in the graduate 
department, oras candidates for undergraduate examinations. Applications for reg- 
istration begin to come in from adistance. In view of the rapid progress which this 
enterprise is making, I can not but request for it the most attentive consideration 
of this board and other friends of higher education. * * * The woman’s depart- 
ment of the university requires and must soon have an ample, permanent home of 
its own, a well-endowed and commodious women’s college, presided over by an accom- 
plished lady principal. Not less than half a million dollars is needed for this pur- 
pose. The college must be part and parcel of the university, giving women students 
the full university status, and at some time so furnished, endowed, and equipped as 
to offer them every facility for education, physical and social as well as intellectual, 
now within the reach of male students. It may be confidently asserted thatno other 
expenditure of half a million dollars could possibly advance the higher life of Rhode 
Island society in coming time so much as the erection of such a college. 
  GRADUATE DEPARTMENT OF YALE UNIVE 
  SITY OPEN TO WOMEN. 
[Report of the President for 1892, pages 30, 31.] 
The plan proposed for the opening of the courses of tho study in the graduate 
department which lead to the degree of doctor of philosophy to graduates of all 
colleges and universities, without distinction of sex, was mentioned in the last 
annual report. This plan was brought before the entire body of professors con- 
nected with these courses, and was fully considered and discussed by them, in the 
earlier part of the year. It was presented to the consideration of the members of 
. the corporation at their meeting held in the month of March, and was favorably 
received by them, and, with unimportant modifications, adopted. The action by 
which these privileges were offered to graduates of the colleges for young women 
was everywhere appreciated very highly, as was made manifest both by the favor- 
able comments of the public journals, and by the assurances which came from these 
colleges and their officers and teachers. 
At the beginning of the new academic year twenty-three young women connected 
themselves with this department of university. They represent all the leading 
colleges which have been established especially for the education of women, and 
also some of the most prominent institutions in which young women and young men 
are educated together. Two of them received fellowships, and three other scholar- 
ships, according to the provisions madeby the corporation, which were stated in 
the last report. All of them are pursuing, with much energy and success, the 
various branches of study to which they have devoted themselves.

Students by courtesy.—Young women who are not less than 16 years of age, and 
thoroughly prepared, will be admitted by courtesy to any of the courses of the aca- 
demic department. They will be subjected to the same entrance examinations for 
the various courses and to the same rules as to attendance and performance of duty 
as youngmen. Though not formally matriculated, they will have the same privi- 
leges of instruction as young men, and on the completion of any full course leading 
to an academic degree will be recommended by the faculty for the same. 
The fees will be: For a single course, $20; for two courses, $35; for three or more 
courses, $50; library fee, $5.

The collegiate course for women.—This course, established in 1883, to meet an appar- 
ent public. demand for the higher and better education of young women, has not in 
its present form proved successful. The college provided examinations, but required 
that preparation be made elsewhere. The women students desired instruction rather 
than examination. Accordingly, after an experience of five years, it has been decided

by the trustees to discontinue the collegiate course for women in its present form, 
and to approve the establishment of an associate but separate school, under the 
name of Barnard College, in which the instruction shall or may be given by the pro- 
fessors of the college under certain regulations and restrictions. This course will 
therefore be discontinued at the close of the present year, except for those who have 
already completed a part of the prescribed studies, 
In accordance with this division funds were raised for the equipment and main- 
tenance of a college for women. 
The name, Barnard College, was adopted in gratéful recognition of the faith and 
energy with which the late president of Columbia College, Dr. F, A. P. Barnard, for 
many years supported and promoted the cause of the higher education of women. 
This connection of Barnard College with Columbia College was officially recog- 
nized by the trustees of Columbia College in March, 1889, 
RADCLIFFE COLLEGE, UNDER THE AUSPICES OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY. 
{From the Harvard Graduates’ Magazine, March, 1894, pp. 339-342.] 
On December 6, 1893, the board of overseers of Harvard College, by a unanimous 
vote, gave its consent to an arrangement to be made between the university and the 
Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women. That arrangement had been 
approved by the president and fellows, and was set forth in certain votes which had 
been passed by the society and submitted to the president and fellows, and which 
were as follows: 
“Voted, That it is desirable to change the name of this corporation (The Society 
for the Collegiate Instruction of Women) to Radcliffe College, and that proper legal 
steps be taken to effect that change. 
“ Voted, That it is desirable that this corporation give degrees in arts and sciences, 
and that 2 committee of 3 persons be appointed by the president to take steps to 
obtain from the legislature the necessary power. 
“Voted, That the president and fellows of Harvard College be, and hereby are, 
made and appointed the visitors to this corporation, and are hereby vested with 
all visitorial power and authority as fully as if the same had been originally con- 
ferred upon the said president and fellows by the charter or articles of association 
of this corporation. This vote shall take eflect upon an acceptance by the said 
president and fellows of the powers hereby conferred, but with the provision that 
said president and fellows at any time may abandon and surrender or limit such 
powers upon notice to this corporation. 
“Voted, That no instructor or examiner of this corporation shall be appointed, 
employed, or retained without the approval of the visitors of this corporation, mani- 
fested in such way as said visitors may prescribe. 
“Voted, That in case the president and fellows of Harvard College accept the 
powers conferred by the foregoing vote the said president and fellows be requested. 
to empower the president of Harvard University to countersign the diplomas of 
this corporation and to affix the seal of Harvard University to said diplomas.” 
By the arrangement embodied in these votes and now accepted and approved by 
the governing boards of the university, Harvard assumes definite and official 
relations with the work which has been prosecuted for some time in Cambridge 
under the popular name of the Harvard Annex. (Pp. 329-330.) 
* * * * * * * 
In this year, 1894, the annex enters into a declared connection with the university. 
It has become plain to everyone that the institution had passed its phase of private 
experiment, and was entitled to s*me formal recognition by the university, 
What shape this should take was a question with many difficulties, for the univer- 
sity scheme had no place ready for the newcomer. Two or three main points were 
gradually developed by discussion. 
In the first place, of course, no one wanted to incorporate the annex bodily into 
the university, and mingle its students with the young men. It was plain that the 
young women must be separately cared for, and that their household concerns and 
domestic economy must be in the hands of a board composed, at least in part, of 
wemen. Furthermore, the president and fellows of Harvard College were unwilling 
to add to their administrative work, already excessively heavy, by taking charge of 
the property or attending to the executive details of another enterprise, and they 
preferred, for general convenience, to commit to a distinet body the management of 
an undertaking which was to be detached, in many respects, from the present organi- 
zation of the university 
     
-P-A-G-E-228
858 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  It resulted from these considerations that tho college for women should have a 
separate organization, formally independent, and distinguished by its own title. 
Such a separation does not preclude any relation which the university may wish to 
establish between itself and the new college, nor prevent changes in that relation 
whenever they may be found desirable. A college on this footing may hereafter 
stand toward the university in a position closely analogous to that held by a college 
in an English university. 
What should be the nature of the connection between the two bodies was the next 
question and the chief one. The university was entirely ready to assume the con- 
trol of the work of teaching, the most vital matter for the women’s college, and to 
establish, formally and officially, what had hitherto been informally permitted as a 
private arrangement, that the instructors of the women’s college should be those 
already actually in the university, or specially approved by it, and that the stand- 
ards and examinations should be identical in the two. It was not easy to express 
or define this arrangement by a comprehensive phrase. It finally took the shape 
of a visitorial power, to be assumed by the university over the new college. This 
power is, of course, but vaguely described in the word visitorial, but it is neverthe- 
less, in fact, most substantial, and with the understanding which has been estab- 
lished by fifteen years of experience it is effectual and insures a close union in essen- 
tial matters. In this view the vagueness of the term is, and was meant to be favor- 
able to the growth of whatever further connection may hereafter be developed. 
Some anxiety has been expressed by eager advocates of women’s education because 
the university has not made a formal contract, nor specified in what way it will 
exercise its powers, nor enumerated the privileges it will give to women, nor 
even fixed the time for which it will abide by the new arrangement, which, on the 
contrary, is expressly made terminable at its pleasure. But the want of definite 
articles of agreement is by no means a ground of apprehension to those who know 
the history of the annex and appreciate how fully it is already a part of the university 
through adoption by the faculty, which is for this purpose the university. No one 
who understands university methods, and especially the character, traditions, and 
policy of Harvard College will be disturbed by the fear that she will abandon a work 
to which she has set her hand or allow it to languish. The very want of precision 
and limitation in the terms of the arrangement indicate a union, not a contract, and 
is an assurance of intimacy and identical interests in the one essential matter of 
education. The change from a private cooperative plan of individual professors to 
an officially determined connection with the university is a vital change for the 
annex and practically fixes it as a part of the university, whether in the present 
form or some other. 
The question of university degree remained, and this was met in the only way now 
practicable. The graduates of the annex have always had a not unreasonable feel- 
ing of deprivation in that their thorough and systematic work, fulfilling the highest 
standard of college work in the country, was not’ marked by any degree or title, 
while the same work brought to men the distinction of a Harvard degree. The 
annex certificate did represent, to those who were well informed, the fact of educa- 
tion, but the symbol is also valuable, and is even of material value, for high employ- 
ment as teachers is more readily offered to those who have a college degree. 
The corporation of Harvard College, however, was not prepared to offer to women 
the university degree of bachelor of arts, and it must be admitted that there is rea- 
son for caution before taking a step so important and so irrevocable. Sucha degree 
would probably at once attract a large number of women, and it is not clear how 
the scheme could stand a sudden accession of large numbers. To make anything 
like an impartial sharing of the resources of the university would cripple the present 
work for men even if no law or principle forbade such an application of the funds 
and property now devoted to the education of men alone. Nor is it clear that the 
opinion of the graduates and friends of the university is yet so settled as to justify 
this departure from the established constitution of the university. 
In view of these and other considerations, the corporation of the university 
declared itself unwilling to offer its A. B. degree. It was, however, willing to give 
to the young women a formal certificate, establishing their position at even grade 
with the Harvard bachelor of arts by graduation from the college which Harvard 
University is to supervise. The degree, therefore, is to be that of the new college, 
but countersigned by the president of the university and bearing the university seal. 
Exactly what shall be the form of that degree has not been determined, but it is not 
likely to be less explicit than the certificate now used, as given above, in stating 
that the recipient has accomplished the full measure of undergraduate work which 
entitles a student of the university to its bachelor’sdegree, If experience of the new 
arrangement with the women’s college shall hereafter justify any further recognition 
of its graduates the university is likely to be ready to advance along the path on 
which it has now entered. | 
The matter of graduate instruction for women has not been made the subject of 
any definite arrangement, for the reasons given above, namely, that this is now com-

plicated, for the university, with question of laboratory accommodation, and the 
readiness of individual professors to arrange classes at once for women. Such classes 
are now made up in special cases, and difficulties in this direction are sure to decrease 
with the adjustments which grow with experience, especially if money is furnished 
for a better provision of apparatus. Itis expected that the opportunities for grad- 
uate work will be much extended under the care of the university, and to this exten- 
sion the opinions of many members of the university faculty are known to be favor- 
able. 
The plan embodying the main features stated above was informally submitted by 
the president of the university to the faculty, and was heartily assented to by them, 
and this assent secured the continuance of that indispensable support upon which 
the annex has hitherto relied. It is this arrangement which, embodied in the votes 
of the society as given above, is now approved by both the goyerning boards of the 
university. 
It now remains only to obtain an act of the legislature changing the name of the 
society, and giving it the power to confer degrees, and to enter into the proposed 
connection with the university. The society being already incorporated, no charter 
is sought. Tho act proposed does not fix any unalterable relations between tho 
women’s college and the university, but merely authorizes the former “‘to confer at 
any time upon the president and fellows of Harvard College such power of visita- 
tion, and of direction and control over its management, as the said corporation may 
deem it wise to confer and the said the president and fellows may consent to 
assume.” This will leave it open for the university to adopt hereafter any arrange- 
ment it may choose, and to change the plan as experience may show to be desirable, 
COEDUCATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 
KNOXVILLE, TENN., April 30, 1894. 
My Dear Sir: Replying to your communication of the 26th in regard to the work- 
ing of coeducation in this university, allow me to say: 
(1) It has been tried only one year, but so far as may be judged by that there is no 
occasion to regret its adoption. 
(2) Fifty young women—not under 17 years of age—have been admitted, and both 
in quality and quantity of work they rank above any 50 of the male students of the 
same age and class. £ 
(3) It is fair to say that I think the large majority of those who applied for 
entrance this (the first) year are, in spirit and purpose, if not in capacity, above the 
ordinary average that one could expect. They have seemed anxious to do nothing 
that would bring the plan into disrepute. 
(4) No changes in courses were made for their benefit and no additional ‘expense 
incurred by their admission beyond the fitting up of a suitable building for their 
occupancy during the day when not at lectures. They board in approved private 
families in the city. 
(5) A prudent watchfulness is exercised to forestall any imprudence or indiscre- 
tion, but that is all. It is our policy not to keep a boy who has to be watched, and 
that policy will be emphasized in case of women. 
(6) They have given no trouble in the discipline, and their general influence in 
class and university life has been salutary. 
Very respectfully, 
T. W. JORDAN, 
Dean and Professor of Latin University of Tennessee.

  UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES FOR THE CoLorEeD Racer, 
There are twenty-five universities and colleges, located mainly in the Southern 
States, devoted to the education of young men and women of the colored race. Theso 
twenty-five institutions have grounds and buildings estimated at $3,054,433, and 
they have permanent productive funds to the amount of $757,446. The two univer- 
sities in Atlanta, Ga., have property valued at halfa million dollars, while the threo 
in Nashville, Tenn., have property valued at considerably more than half a million, 
Fisk University alone having a valuation of $350,000. Lincoln University, Pennsyl- 
vania, has property valued at $185,000 and an endowment of $237,450. 
The most salient pointin connection with colored education in professional schools 
is the rapid increase in the number of students engaged in the study of medicine 
and law in the last few years. In theology the number has not increased of late 
years; infact, there seems to have been a slight decrease. In 1886-’87 there were 933 
theological students; in 1889-90 there were 734; in 1891~92 there were 577. In the 
law schools, however, the number has been increasing ; 81 students in 1886~87 and 119 
in 189192. But in the medical schools we find astill larger increase; 165studentsin 
1886~’87, 310 in 1889-’90, and 457 in 1891-92. It is very probable that there will be 
an increase for some years in all of these lines, for, notwithstanding the occasional’ 
averment of moral obliquity in some of the clerical order, the devout will only recog- 
nize the greater need of earnest, consecrated men to proclaim the saving truth and 
to establish the people in the paths of rectitude, while the less punctilious will feel 
that there should be more of that charity which hopeth all things and is not easily

  866 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. - 
provoked, and all will be attracted by the opportunities of coming before the people 
and exercising the oratorical gifts which they so frequently possess. It is but natu- 
ral to expect, too, that the thousands of colored people will furnish employment to 
many of their race both in healing the sick and in representing their claims in the 
courts, and so long as there shall ‘be room for more in these pursuits the candidates 
will probably not “be lacking. 
For the last three years the number of students reported as engaged in collegiate 
studies has been about 800. The question may be asked, why is it there are not 
more collegiate students when there are twenty-five universities and colleges pre- 
pared to receive them? In the first place, a large number of colored boys and girls, 
especially those living in the rural regions, do not have the opportunity of finishing 
even the elementary studies with much success, on account of the brief term of three 
to five months in the public schools and the defective instruction imparted therein. 
This eliminates a very large number of possible candidates for higher education. 
In many of the schools for white children, when the public term expires, the school 
is continued without interruption, each pupil paying a small tuition fee; but here- 
tofore the colored people have not been able to continue their schools in this way. 
Again, in the Southern States it is comparatively easy for a young colored man of 
energy and a good secondary education to find employ: ment which vat once enables 
him to begin saving up something and to get a start in the world. When he once 
begins to ‘aceumulate means, the ‘desire to increase the amount comes to him just as 
to others, and consequently he soon has plans formed in which further education is 
not considered, especially when he sees that it would take several years to secure the 
funds and finish the course. He naturally concludes to let well enough alone. As 
there are comparatively few colored parents able to bear the expense of sending 
their children through a college course, those who are qualified to begin higher 
studies fall in the number just “nentioned and do not attend for the reasons there 
stated. 
The work of the colored universities and colleges, therefore, is at. present to a 
large extent, below the grade of a university, but they are now only laying the 
foundation of their future work. Many of their students who are grown young men 
and women are only engaged in secondary work, and they are entitled to commenda- 
tion for that degree of progress. The colored boy in getting an education encounters 
many difficulties. The school which he first enters probably continues three or four 
months; the rest of the year he labors at whatever he finds to do, and if he fortu- 
natély gets a good place he probably keeps it for a year or two. Then he spends 
another short term in a school which probably scarcely deserves to be called a schoo]— 
tho teacher incompetent, no apparatus whatever, possibly not a single blackboard, 
and children of all ages and sizes crowded into a building seemingly constructed to 
avoid any financial loss when the cyclone shall have leveled it tothe ground. After 
several years spent in this haphazard way of getting an education, he resolves to 
enter a college, but as his parents have little means, he has to work his w ay through. 
But all through the course and in after years he labors under difficulties on account 
of his defective elementary education. But notwithstanding the difficulties under 
which they labor, many young colored men manage to acquire a very valuable 
training. 
“A law student at Shaw University helped to support a widowed mother and 
worked his way up, teaching a school of 80 scholars 4 miles in the country, walking 
both ways, and yet studying law and reciting at night, nearly a mile away from 
home. He was finally graduated with honor and admitted to the bar, sustaining 
decidedly the best examination in a class of 30, all the others white, mostly from 
the North Carolina State University, and he as black as you will often’ see, yet_com- 
plimented without stint by his white competitors and by the chief justice himself”— 
[American Missionary, June, 1893. 
While the controversy is going on as to whether the negro is capable of receiving 
the higher education, and while many reasons are being advanced why he is not, the 
colored man himself is saying nothing about it, but is going forward learning all he 
ean and endeavoring to increase the number of object lessons with which the theorist 
must contend. The number of highly educated colored ministers, lawyers, doctors, 
and educators issmall, indeed, as yet, and they are scattered over a wide expanse of 
territory, but each year sees the number increasing, for the very rarity of the highly 
educated coloredman is best known by his own race, and hence when they see one of 
their number possessing talents so cultivated as to command the admiration of all, 
or when one of them is able to secure a position of high honor and distinction, it is 
observed by none more quickly than by the colored people themselves. One colored 
man inthe House of Representatives of the U. 8. Congress will excite a thou- 
sand hopes and aspirations in the breasts of his admiring friends, and for every 
one who is thus able to rise to distinction hundreds of others will enter the doors 
of some university or college resolved that if they shall not be able to reach the 
acme of their ambition, they will at least attain to the highest point.their oppor-

tunities and diligence will permit them. The colored parent, too, will be stimulated 
to give his children the advantage of every educational facility possible, even though 
he recognizes that it will require great sacrifices on his part, for he feels that in so 
doing he will be assisting in the elevation of his race, something in which he takes 
a personal interest. 
NORTHERN AID TO COLORED SCHOOLS. 
The great work of educating the colored race is being carried on mainly by the 
public schools of the Southern States, supported by funds raised by public taxation 
and managed and controlled by public school officers. The work is too great to be 
attempted by any other agency, unless by the National Government, the field is too 
extensive, the officers too numerous, the cost too burdensome. Societies and 
churches may temporarily take hold of places neglected by public-school officers 
and show by their work what is needed, but they can not attempt the work legiti- 
mately belonging to the public schools. This aim is kept steadily in view by the 
societies which have been long engaged in helping the colored child lift itself up 
in the world and begin work on a higher plane. 
But while the work as a whole can be carried on only by public taxation, it is 
being aided very substantially by the societies and churches in the Northern and 
Western States, which have had their missionary teachers engaged there since the 
first opportunity was offered them, even before the war had ended. Most of the 
aid given by these States goes through the regular channels of some organization, 
but there are quite a number of colored schools which depend entirely on appeals to 
individuals for help. 
At the close of the war the different denominations began to vie with each other in 
the education of the freedmen, who had hitherto not been allowed in a schoolroom, 
Young men and women full of missionary spirit left home and friends to go into dis- 
tant parts of the South to educate children, parents, and grandparents, for they 
were all in the same classes, and they began at the beginning. These teachers soon 
found that it required a missionary spirit indeed, for there was something of pathos 
as well as romance in the work. Now, scattered all over the South, at one place 
representing one denomination, at another place some other denomination or society, 
are to be found schools filled to overflowing with eager learners, taught generally 
by teachers selected for their competency and missionary zeal. These Eclonis are 
not intended to antagonize the public schools. Generally they are of a higher grade 
than the public schools, and when not they serve as model schools and are carried 
on in a way to enable needy children to work out an education. Not only havesuch 
schools been established and maintained and help given to deserving pupils, but 
with almost every school a church has also been established to furnish religious 
instruction. But reference is intended to be made here to school work only. 
The Freedmen’s Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church was one of the 
earliest to enter upon the work of colored education, and it is now one of the most 
important factors inthe work. The extent of its effort among colored people in 
189293 is indicated by the following summary of institutions, teachers, students, 
and property: Schools, 23; teachers, 214; students, 5,396; property, $1,183,000. In 
addition to the regular teachers, 165 practice teachers were employed from the nor- 
mal departments. Its expenditure for colored schools in 1892-’93, after deducting 
tuition fees paid by the pupils and the amount paid by the State of South Carolina 
to the agricultural school at Claflin University, was about $200,000. 3 
Another very important factor in the work is the American Missionary Association, 
one of the pioneers in entering upon this work of education and one of the largest 
contributors up to the present time. The Daniel Hand fund, amounting to 
$1,000,894, was placed in the hands of this association by Mr. Hand himself, while 
still living, and the income (but the income only) is to be used in educating colored 
boys and girls in the recent slave States. 
The John F. Slater fund is held by a board of trustees, of whom Dr. J. L. M. Curry 
is the general agent, and the income is distributed to various schools, but not nec- 
essarily to the same schools each year. It is intended mainly to supplement local 
funds and to stimulate local effort. The Peabody fund also aids very materially in 
this work. 
The Board of Missions for Freedmen of the Presbyterian Church is taking an active 
part in the education of the colored race. During the year 1892-93 it had 86 schools, 
15 of them being boarding schools, 252 teachers, and 10,520 pupils. Biddle Univer- 
sity, Charlotte, N. C., Scotia Seminary, and Mary Allen Seminary were among those 
supported by it. Schools have also been established by the Baptists, Lutherans, 
United Presbyterians, Catholics, Episcopalians, and Friends. 
There is a wonderful contrast in the character of the schools established for col- 
ered children. Many of the schools, especially those in the remote rural regions, 
are as defective as one could imagine a school to be; but, on the other hand, most
-P-A-G-E-238

of those established by the missionary societies, are better managed and have 
a better class of teachers. These teachers have generally been educated in the 
_best Northern schools, and coming as they do from different States, they com- 
bine the best methods of different schools. Frequently, too, they have undertaken 
the work from philanthropic motives and are filled with aspirations not only to ele- 
vate the intellectual capacity of their pupils, but to implant in them high and 
ennobling principles, and by means of this training given at school to elevate the 
entire race. In some cases these teachers have refused much larger salaries, in order 
to continue what had become to them a labor of love; they preferred the sutisfac- 
tion of helping to build up a race rather than to enter into the contest for pelf, 
SCHOOLS CONDUCTED BY COLORED INSTRUCTORS. 
That the institutions for the colored race are beginning to accomplish the purpose 
for which they were mainly founded, namely, that they might train up leaders for 
the colored people from their own race—preachers, teachers, doctors, lawyers, ete.— 
is shown by the fact that there are now some institutions of high grade and of 
growing popularity that are conducted entirely by colored instructors, and these 
are educating others who will be able to fill their places with equal if not greater 
success. While many schools are being conducted wholly o1 in part by colored 
teachers, a few conspicuous examples are given of what they sometimes accomplish. 
Allen University, Columbia, 8. C., was established in 1881 by the African Metho- 
dist Episcopal Church, and has been conducted solely by colored teachers. From 
the very first it has enjoyed great success, and during the year 1891~92 there was 
an attendance of 465 students. 
In Biddle University, Charlotte, N. C., all of the eleven instructors except one in 
the industrial department, are colored. This institution ranks among the very best 
in the land for colored education of high grade. Although it is a school for colored 
students and taught by colored teachers, it has some of its strongest friends among 
the white people who live in that part of the State, and who are therefore well 
acquainted with the work accomplished by it. Senator Zebulon B. Vance and Dr. 
Drury Lacy, lately president of Davidson College, North Carolina, have spoken of it 
ag accomplishing great good for both the educational and religious welfare of the 
race. (Further notice of this school on page 869). 
One of the most conspicuous results of colored enterprise and ability is the Tus- 
kegee Normal and Industrial School, of Tuskegee, Ala. This institution is an 
achievement of Mr. Booker T. Washington, a gradnate of the Hampton Normal Insti- 
tute. Opened in 1881 with 1 teacher and 30 pupils, it attained such success that in 
1892 there were 44 officers and teachers and over 600 students. It also owns property 
estimated at $150,000, upon which there is no incumbrance. Gen. 8. C. Armstrong 
said of it: “I think itis the noblest and grandest work of any colored man in the 
Jand. What compares with it in genuine value and power for good? It is on the 
Hampton plan, combining labor and study, commands high respect from both races, 
flies no denominational flag, but is thoroughly and earnestly Christian; it is out of 
debt, well managed and organized.” In Alabama Mr. Booker T. Washington is rec- 
ognized by all as one of the leaders of the race, facile princeps. is efforts and influ- 
ence are not confined to building up and sustaining the large institution which he 
has established. Several conventions of leading colored men have been held at Tus- 
kegee, at his suggestion, to consider ways and means for the moral, educational, and 
financial elevation of the colored people in general. 
INDUSTRIAL INSTRUCTION. 
Most of the colored institutions bear a close resemblance to ‘a large household 
which carries on the work of education, the cultivation of the farm, the building and 
repairing of houses, the raising of cattle, and in which the pupils are furnished an 
object lesson in the proper management and conduct of a household of which they 
form part, and can therefore continue afterwards when opportunity shall present 
itself. 
Tougaloo University, Mississippi, for instance, is situated about half a mile from 
tho Illinois Central Railroad, and 7 miles north of Jackson, the capital of the State. 
The grounds embrace about 500 acres of land, and furnish a temporary home for a 
family of about 200 persons, who have built the houses in which they live, who raise 
the large quantities of corn, wheat, potatoes, fruits, and vegetables necessary to 
supply their table, who raise their own cattle, milk their own cows, cook their own 
food, laundry their clothes, and, lastly, provide for their own instruction. In @ 
word, they are, to alarge extent, independent of the rest of the world. This method 
of training is the kind specially needed by them, for, on account of their meager 
circumstances, they are too little acquainted with model homeand family life. Once
-P-A-G-E-239
    EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 869 
having felt and learned to appreciate its elevating inflnences, however, they have 
an ideal to which they ever afterwards aspire and without which they can never 
rest contented. iy 
Moreover, the education they receive in these collective households will enable 
them to earn good wages, teach them how to use their carnings to the best advan- 
tage, and consequently they will in all probability have the opportunity of carrying 
out on a smaller scale their ideal home methods. 
In fact, the desire to own a home is already quite common among the colored peo- 
ple, and that many of them are beginning to do so is shown by the great increase 
during the last decade in the amount of property which they own in Georgia. In 
that State there is kept a separate account of the assessed property of colored peo- 
le. In 1882 the amount of assessed property held by colored people in Georgia was 
$6,589,876; in 1892, the amount was $14,869,575, an increase of more than 100 per 
cent. 
In Claflin University, South Carolina, is to be found the same family life as that 
of Tougaloo University, but on a still larger scale. 
Although specially adapted to the needs of the race, it is probable that this 
method of conducting an educational institution was not selected as being the mo:t 
desirable, but rather because it was well recognized that in no other way could 
the attendance of a large number of students be expected. What would be regarded 
as a very moderate cost of education in most of the institutions for white students 
would have been beyond the reach of most colored students, but by the plan adopted 
at Claflin the expenses for board and tuition are reduced to $8.50 per month, and at 
Allen University to $5.50 per month. Quite frequently, too, part of these expenses 
is paid by manual work, either for the institution or for adjacent residents. It 
is by reason of this low cost of education that we find over 600 boys and girls 
attending Claflin University, and in fact that we find all of the colored schools filled 
to overflowing. Many of the students begin a school year with about as much means 
as would be thought sufficient for a month or two, but they manage to pull along 
the entire year, and after three more months of work, instead of that much time 
spent in idleness, they are again found on the grounds of the institution, happy on 
account of their growing independence and ability. They have no fear of not being 
able to find some work to do, for they know how to work and above all are willing 
to work, and when one possesses these two qualifications he will rarely lack employ- 
ment. pits,

  870 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Lincoln University, Pa.—Rev. W. P. White, in Church at Home and Abroad says: 
Of institutions making the advanced education of colored youth and their training 
as teachers and preachers to their own people a chief end and aim, one of the fore- 
most, as well as the earliest established, is Lincoln University. 
It is located in eastern Pennsylvania, on the line of the Philadelphia and: Balti- 
more Central Railroad, 46 miles from Philadelphia and 61 miles from Baltimore. 
No better physical or geographical location could be found. 
It isnear enough to the border line of the South to be easily accessible to the 
great majority of those needing and desiring its benefits, and yet far enough from 
the associations and influence to which they have all their lives been subjected. 
It was founded in 1854, six years before the war which gave emancipation to the 
colored race. During this period it had to contend with prejudice strong and 
bitter. The negro’s right to be a man and to receive the blessings which Christ 
offers freely to every race was not then so universally admitted. ‘ 
Previous to 1864 it was known as Ashmun Institute, but in that year an amended 
charter, with additional privileges, was obtained for it, and anew name was assumed, 
one that will be forever linked with the freedom of the negro and with the most 
eventful crisis of American history. 
Since then the institution has grown largely in resources, in influence, and in 
adaptability to the end for which it was established. The results of its work will 
compare favorably with those of any institution of like age in the history of our 
country. Five hundred young men have been sent from the preparatory depart- 
ment and from the lower classes of the collegiate department, many of whom are 
engaged in important positions as teachers in the Southern States. 
Nearly 400 have been graduated from the collegiate department after a course of 
instruction extending through four and in many cases seven years. Most of these 
graduates are engaged in professional and educational labors in the South, 
About 200 have graduated in the theological department and received ordination 
as ministers in different evangelical denominations. Thirteen have gone to Africa 
as missionaries of the cross. 
The institution has so commended itself to noble men and women of wealth during 
the past twenty-five years as to lead them to place it upon a firm financial basis, 
thus securing to it a large degree of success in its work. 
Mr. Fayerwether, in including it, a few years since, with other representative 
institutions of the land, for a share in his munificent bequest to the extent of 
$100,000, testified in the most striking way to its importance and usefulness. 
The campus or grounds of the university consist of 78 acres, on which are four dor- 
mitories for students; Livingston Hall, for commencement assemblies, capable of 
seating 1,000 persons; University Hall, a four-story building, containing eighteen 
rooms, designed largely for recitation and class purposes, carefully constructed and 
conveniently arranged, and surmounted by a revolving observatory for the reception 
of the telescope recently presented to the university; and the Mary Dod Brown 
Memorial Chapel, containing an audience room for Sabbath services, seating 400 
persons; a prayer hall for daily use, communicating with the chapel by sliding 
frames, and two class-rooms similarly connected with the prayer hall. 
The nine professorships, including the president’s chair, are all endowed and filled 
by able and efficient scholars and teachers. 
For twenty-seven years Rey. Isaac N. Rendall, p. p., has been its president, and 
to his eminent fitness for the position is owing largely its success and present proud 
position among institutions of its kind. 
The connection with it in earlier years, as instructors, of such men as Revs. E. E. 
Adams, E, R. Bower, Thomas W. Cattell, and Casper R. Gregory served to give it 
its wide reputation. 
Each successive year of its history has brought to it an increased number of stu- 
dents, until now 240 crowd its halls and tax to the utmost its measure of accommoda- 
tion and means for their support. These 240 students represent twenty-two States 
of the Union, the West Indies, South America, and Africa, Among them are seven 
sons of alumni. Three-fourths of them at least are professing Christians. Perhaps 
one-half of them will study for the ministry. 
In their eager desire for knowledge and in their aptness of reception of it, in 
their application to study and their readiness in recitation; in their observance of 
the rules of the institution and in the conduct of their devotional meetings, little 
difference is observed between them and those of white institutions. 
From the Howard Quarterly, January, 1893.—The fact that the 141 colored students 
in white colleges keep up with their classes without difficulty, and in many cases 
have been the recipients of special honors for proficiency in their studies, shows 
that they can pursue these higher branches with a success equal to that of their white 
classmates. Many individual examples may be cited besides that of the colored class 
orator of Harvard two years ago. The last one is from the Chicago University, 
where a colored girl led the entire entrance class in the December examinations. and

received. a very substantial reward in a scholarship which will pay all expenses of 
the four years’ course. This young lady prepared for college at Howard University. 
Private schools should not antagonize public schools.—J. L. M. Curry: In some of the 
towns and cities there is, possibly, an unwise multiplication of denominational or 
independent schools. Christian denominations are rivals in their establishment, in 
getting the largest number of pupils, and in making the most attractive exhibition. 
It seems to be a weakness and an error common to all to seek to catalogue as many 
names as possible. The aggregate means not the habitual and average attendance, 
but all who, for any time, one day or several months, have matriculated. This mili- 
tates against the usefulness and popularity of the free schools. In so far as these 
institutions, not under State control, impair the efficiency of, or divert attendance 
from, the public schools, they are mischievous, for the great inass of children, white 
and black, must, more in the future than at present, depend almost exclusively upon 
the State schools for the common branches of education. These schools, permanent, 
not subject to caprice or varying seasons, incorporated into the body politic, into 
the organic law, must be the chief factor in the education of the people. At great 
sacrifices, the Southern States have provided means of education, constantly improv- 
ing and enlarging, for the colored children, The large number at school, over 
1,200,000, is the proof that no obstacles are thrown in the way of their getting such 
rudiments as the common schools impart, and of occasionally rising to higher grades. 
An educational charity would sadly fail of its purpose if any, the least. impediment 
were placed in the path of free shools. 
George R. Smith College, Sedalia, Mo.—The cornerstone of George R. Smith College 
was laid June 1, 1893, Rev. J. C. Hartzell, of the Christian Educator, being master 
of ceremonies. Thisinstitution dates itsinception from the gift of 25 acres of land, 
valued at $25,000, at Sedalia. Mo., by two daughters of Gen. George R. Smith. The 
building, when completed and furnished, it is estimated, will cost $35,000. The 
superintendent of construction, Mr. La Port, will take a lively interest in the work, 
not only from his connection with it, but on account of his own dramatic history. 
Born a slave, he ran away at 12, but afterwards worked fourteen years to obtain the 
money necessary to secure his freedom. He is now worth $75,000, and supports 
his aged mother and the widow of the master from whom he purchased his freedom. 
Of the amount required for building, the conferences of Missouri assumed $14,000, 
of which amount $3,000 was paid at the time the cornerstone was laid. Rev. P. A. 
Cool was appointed president of the institution, and will devote his attention to 
raising funds until the building is completed. 
American Missionary, December, 1892—We have one woman 48 years old, mother of 
9 children, who walks daily to and from her house, 3 miles distant. She brings with 
her 2 daughters and an adopted son, but leads them all in her classes. This woman 
was 2 slave before the war and having brought up a family since, this is her tirst 
chance to attend school. 
The Tribune.—It is an interesting and significant circumstance that the highest 
honor at Boston University this year has been awarded to a colored man, Thomas 
Nelson Baker, who was born a slave in Virginia in 1860. He has paid his own 
college expenses by teaching, and the disadvantages under which he has labored 
account for the fact that hisage is considerably greater than that of the average 
college graduate. He was fond of books from his boyhood, and was bound to get 
an education. What he has accomplished should be an inspiration to others of 
negro blood. 
Straight University, New Orleans.—On the night of November 30, 1891, the uni- 
versity building of Straight University, New Orleans, was destroyed by fire, 
together with the library of 2,500 volumes, printing press, chemical and philo- 
sophical apparatus. A new building, however, was soon planned and has been 
finished. It is three stories high, of a pleasing style of architecture, and contains 
on the first floor the chapel (seating 350 persons), four recitation rooms, a large 
college room, music room, libraries and offices of the president and treasurer; on 
the second floor are the rooms set apart for the chemical department; and on the 
third floor are dormitories for theological students and their reading room, 
Biddle University, Charlotte, N. C.—Rev. E.P.Cowan: The present faculty of 11 
men, all of whom are colored but one, are not only engaged in attending to the duties 
of their respective places as professors, but they are also engaged in demonstrating 
before the world the proposition that educated colored men are capable of success- 
fully carrying on the education of other colored men. 
The proposition to many is so simple that it seems hardly to need demonstration; 
yet some have doubted. 
As not all educated white men are capable of successfully administering the affairs 
of large institutions designed for the education of their kind, so it is not claimed 
that every educated colored man is capable of becoming a«successful educator; but 
itis claimed that out of the product of our educational work of the last twenty- 
aight years more than enough selected men can be found perfectly competent to do 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
  
872 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
tho work to be done even at so large and important an educational center as Biddle 
University. 
The best argument in favor of Biddle University, as at present organized, is the 
good condition in which it now is, and the good work that is now being done. This 
“ean be seen by any one who will take the time and trouble to visic the place and 
examine for himself. The number of students has largely increased, and the gradu- 
ating class will be the largest that has ever gone out from the college since it 
obtained its present charter. 
The order and decorum of the students is remarkable. The rules are stringent, 
and are obeyed. The buildings are well kept, as far as the age and dilapidated « con- 
Gition of some of them will allow. 
The industria: department is better organized and more efficient than it ever was 
before in the history of the institution. Prof. Hunt, a graduate of Atlanta Univer- 
sity, is a practical carpenter. Under his direction the students have just finished 
building a dwelling house for one of the professors. * * 
Look into the shoe shop and you find a dozen young men (the room will hold no 
inore) who, an hour before, were reading Greek and Latin; now they are sitting on 
cobbler’s benches and are drivi ing wooden pegs. In the next room a dozen more are 
setting type, while two others are turning a large printing press, and a third manis 
“feeding” the machine. 
In all these industrial departments the students spend one hour a day that is 
regarded as practice, and this is set down to ‘‘ tuition.” Laterin the day the same 
student gives an hour to some industrial work, which is regarded as “service.” For 
this he is paid, or rather he is allowed so much to his credit on his individual account 
with the institution. Ifa young man receives pecuniary aid, as many do, he does 
not get this help for nothing. fe must render service, either in Prof. Hunt’s indus- 
trial department or Prof. Carson’s home department, of which service an accurate 
account is kept and the worth of his work is charged up to his credit. In this way 
the student does indeed get aid; but he also is made to feel that he is, at least par- 
tially, working his way. This arrangement is admirable, and is all that could be 
desired. * 
The institution is now running up to its utmost capacity as regards numbers. 
The enrollment so far this year, 1893, is 236. The boys are stowed away in their 
cheap dormitories, in many cases eightin a room. Two students sleep in the engine 
room and over thirty in tho main building, which was never intended for dormitory 
-purposes. Ifthe university only had the necessary accommodations and scholar- 
ships, the roll would easily run up to 500. 
Higher education of the negro race.—Dr. F. G. Woodworth: For the sake of the race 
as well as for their own sakes, those individuals who have the capacity should have 
opportunity for and be urged to seek the so-called higher education, and the highest 
and broadest culture thoy « can obtain. 
‘Thero will be constant and increasing need of leaders for the negro race, men who 
will be able with wise forethought and ripe judgment to guide the people on an 
upward way. The great uplifters of the race must be from the race. They must 
bo men who can be in wholly sympathetic touch with those whom they would ben- 
efit, a sympathetic touch found only in kinship, understanding their needs fully, 
feeling their heart-beats, the stirring of their aspirations, able to ‘touch their natures, 
as we can not touch them who are cast in the Saxon mold. I the white race, with 
its advantages and its inheritances of culture, needs the stimulus of men of high 
education, how much more the colored people? 
Perhaps I may be met by the skepticism whether the negro can take on this higher 
culture. This rests on the assumption that the negro is essentially inferior. It is 
an assumption. No apriori assumption can determine the question either way. It 
must be settled by facts as time shall bring them to light. To-day the evidence of 
facts points in tho direction that some of the negro race can and do take on the 
higher education, and make valuable use of it. Each year sees additions made to 
the small army of cultured and successful doctors, lawyers, teachers, and preachers.

  CHAPTER XXVIII. 
REPORT ON EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
BuREAU OF EpUCATION, ALASKA DIVISION, 
Washington, D. C., June 80, 1892. 
Sir: I have the honor to submit the following annual report of the general agent 
of education for Alaska for the year ending Juno 30, 1892. 
NUMBER AND GENERAL CONDITION OF THE SCHOOLS OF ALASKA. 
There is in Alaska aschool population of from 8,000 to 10,000. Of these, 1,934 were 
enrolled in the 31 schools in operation during the year closing June 30, 1892. Six- 
teen day schools, with an enrollment of 798 pupils, were supported entirely by the 
Government at an expense of $20,020, and fifteen contract schools, with an enroll- 
ment of 1,136, were supported jointly by the Government and the missionary 
societies of the Presbyterian, Moravian, Episcopal, Methodist, Congregational, 
Lutheran, and Roman Catholic churches. Of the pupils in the contract schools, 788 
were day pupils and 348 industrial pupils. These latter were clothed, housed, fed 
and taught. 
The boys were taught shoemaking, housebuilding, furniture-making, coopering, 
baking, gardening, and the care of cattle; the girls were taught cooking, baking, 
washing, ironing, sewing, dressmaking, and housekeeping 
Toward the support of these contract schools the Government contributed $29,980, 
and the missionary societies $68,211.81. P 
UNALASKA DISTRICT. 
Point Barrow contract school.—Presbyterian ; population, Eskimo; L. M. Stevenson, 
teacher. The school was opened October 6, 1892. There were but few natives at the 
time in the village, the majority of them still being absent, hunting on the land and 
fishing in the waters, to secure a supply of winter food. This kept them away until 
the dark days of December, and the searcity of food was such that some remained 
away the entire winter, coming in only to bring supplies of food to their relatives 
that remained in the village. ‘The caribou had migrated further than usual into the 
interior, and only scattered ones wereseen. Again, the ative prejudices against an 
education and the influence of their sorcerers kept some of the children from school, 
so only a few attended the earlicr portion of the year. As the winter advanced, 
however, more came in. The progress of those that did attend was better than that 
of the previous year. They seemed to have remembered what they had learned, and 
started readily upon a review covering what had been gone over, the review being 
thorough and complete, before any new matter was presented, except the short texts 
and phrases which were kept constantly on the blackboard to attract their atten- 
tion. This cultivation of memory was a somewhat difficult task and did not succeed 
as well as was desired. One of the characteristics of the northern Eskimo is the 
idea that “to-morrow will be another day,” and they were unaceustomed to commit 
anything to memory for future use. They seemed, however, to have a great desire to 
know the English language, and studied very diligently in the school room, but 
failed to use what they had learned, outside; although sometimes, when the children 
were on the playground, with none of the older natives around, they used the 
English which they had learied in school quite freely. 
One of the great obstacles to the school work, and the civilization and christian. 
ization of these natives, is the liquor which is smuggled in by a few of the whalers. 
873 
   
-P-A-G-E-244
  874 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
The larger portion of themwhaling fleet is opposed to the introduction of liquors 
among the native people. A few of the captains, however, still believe in it, and, 
as far as they can, avoid the vigilant watch of the revenue cutter, and deal out 
a bottle here and there to the natives for the purpose of inducing trade or something 
worse, Also, sometimes, when the commanding officer of the whaler is opposed to 
the introduction of liquor, some of the men on his ship will smuggle a few bottles 
along, which are dealt out to the natives on the sly. In this way a sufficiency of 
liquor gets into the country to demoralize a number of the natives, and drunkenness 
commences with the arrival of the whaling fleet and lasts until it leaves the country 
in the fall. 
Another inconvenience and difficulty has arisen from the fact that no mission 
buildings have yet been erected, and the school has been dependent upon the cour- 
tesy of Capt. Healy, freely extended, for the use of a room in the refuge station. 
In 1891 the Board of Missions of the Presbyterian Church, who have a contract with 
the Government for the renting of this school, chartered a schooner in San Francisco 
and sent up a load of lumber and building material. The vessel reached within 70 
miles of Point Barrow, when it was stopped by the presence of the ice-pack of the 
Arctic, and could go no further. Under the circumstances the schooner returned to 
Bering Straits, and the lumber was landed at that station. The following year the 
school at Cape Prince of Wales failed to secure a needed supply of lumber from 
San Francisco, and used the lumber that was intended for Point Barrow, necessitat- 
ing the Point Barrow station occupying the refuge station another year. 
Point Hope contract school.—Episcopalian; population, Eskimo, John B. Driggs, mM. 
D., teacher. The population of Point Hope (Tigara) was slightly increased this 
season over last from families arriving from other tribes. Whenever a strange 
family came into the village it at once enrolled its childrenin the school. The daily 
average for the year was 28. It would have been much larger, but for irregular 
attendance caused by whole families going off on hunting trips and remaining from 
one week to a month at a time. 
During the year two new classes were introduced into the school, onein which the 
teacher required the pupils to repeat short sentences in the native language and then 
translate them into the English language orally, or write them out on their slates. 
.The second class was one in which the teacher repeated short English sentences and~ 
had the pupils translate them into their own language. The majority of the chil- 
dren manifested considerable advancement in their studies. 
Cape Prince of Wales contract school.—Congregational; population,’ Eskimo; 
W.T. Lopp, teacher. Mr. Thornton, the associate teacher at this station, having 
returned to the States in the fall of 1891, Mr. Lopp, who remained behind, was the 
only English speaking person left in a large region of country. The lonesomeness 
of such a condition can not be appreciated by anyone who has not been similarly 
situated. Toward spring a native family, who had been off some 300 miles toa 
trading post, returned, bringing with them a dog that would obey commands given 
in the English language. The loneliness had been so great that Mr. Lopp would 
visit that dog every day for the companionship of some animal that had once heard 
the English language. 
The school year was a very prosperous one. The average daily attendance of pupils 
was 106; including teachers, 118. Many of the children mastered the alphabet, 
learned to spell and pronounce simple English words, read in the first reader, write 
a neat and readable hand, and sing gospel and patriotic songs. They also became 
familiar with several hundred English words, and learned the necessity of greater 
cleanliness in their habits. A few of the larger boys and girls were taught to make 
clothing of hair seal skins, after American patterns. Lead pencils, paper, pictures, 
hard bread, combs, and soap were given as prizes for punctuality and diligence. On 
a few oceasions it became necessary to punish pupils by excluding them from the 
privileges of the school for a few days. Visitors to the school came from 50 to 300 
miles around. Last season a school bell was received, which greatly delighted the 
people. However, in October, the teacher was waited upon by one of the leading 
sorcerers, who requested him not to ring it, as the spirits had informed him that the 
noise of the bell would prevent the people from successfully hunting foxes and seals. 
But as white foxes were more abundant than ever the ringing of the bell did not 
seem to have any bad effect. 
Owing to the fear which the chiefs of the village held towards Capt. Healy, of the 
Bear, the village was very free from whisky or drunkenness during the year. They 
expressed a great deal of surprise at the character of the teacher, who neither traded 
nor hunted, and at the time was unmarried. He was a puzzle tothem. They said: 
“Too poor to trade, too stingy to marry, and too effeminate to hunt.” 
The winter was a cold one. ‘The mean temperature from October to May was 5.6° 
and the maximum 40°; minimum, —30°. In February and March Bering Straits 
were blocked up with smooth fields of ice from the North, so that 5 of the people 
made a trip by dog sleds across to Siberia for tobacco.

Ten Eskimo police were appointed by Capt. Healy, of the Bear, to assist the 
teacher and take charge of the drunken natives who might be inclined to be disor- 
derly. These native police worked with great efficiency and were found exceedingly 
useful in preserving order. s 
Unalalaklik contract school.—Swedish Evangelical; population, Eskimo; Axel E. 
Karlson, teacher. No report. r 
Anvik contract school.—Christ Church Mission; Protestant Episcopal; population, 
Indians; John W. Chapman, teacher. School was held from November 9, 1891, to 
April 15, 1892. The hours were from 9 to 3, with an hour’s intermission at 
noon, when the day scholars were furnished with a simple meal. The average daily 
attendance for the year was 24.3. The teacher spent an hour and a half each day 
in oral training, at which the entire school would be required to learn the meaning 
and use of various lists of words, e. g., parts of the body, occupations in the States, 
geographical names, the comparison of adjectives, the conjugation of verbs, etc., as 
well as to construct sentences on given subjects, and read rapidly off hand. This 
seemed to have a stimulating effect upon the pupils. The school was divided into 
three classes, one of which went through the reader twice; the second, once and 
partially again on review, and the third class went half way through the first reader 
during the year. In arithmetic there were daily drills on the multiplication table and 
in combinations of numbers, adding by groups, ete. In geography the pupils were 
made familiar with the grand divisions of land and water, and with some of the more 
prominent natural features in the continent, with the political divisions in North 
America, and several of the groups of States and their typical products and occupa- 
tions. The attendance was larger and more steady than the previous year. 
A boarding school for boys was established and maintained, with an average of 
nine pupils. 
Kosoriffsky contract school.—Holy Cross Mission; Roman Catholic; population, 
Eskimo and Indians; teachers, Sisters of St. Ann. At this station is a large board- 
ing or home school in care of the Sisters of St. Ann, which was begun in August, 
1888. The attendance during the year has been 75 and the progress of the pupils 
good. This progress was largely due to the effect of the pupils being separated from 
their parents and being under the influence of their teachers. 
Besides a good English education, the girls were taught washing, ironing, sewing, 
and cooking. The boys were taught carpentry, blacksmithing, and gardening. 
During the fe summer vacation 6 of them found employment on the river steamer 
as firemen and pilots. 
As in all such schools, English was the only language allowed to be spoken in or 
out of the schoolroom. At the same place and time, and by the same sisters, there 
was conducted a day school with an enrollment of 40scholars. These, however, did 
not progress as much in their studies as did their friends in the boarding school, as 
they were less under the influence of the teachers and irregular in their attendance, 
the necessity of securing food requiring them to change their location and be absent 
from home a considerable portion of the year. 
Nulato contract school.—Roman Catholic; population, Indians; teacher, A 
school of 20 pupils was kept from October 1, 1891, to July 1, 1892. No report. 
Cape Vancouver contract xchool.—Roman Catholic; population, Eskimo; teacher, 
3 enrollment, 20 pupils. No report. 
Bethel contract school—Moravian; population, Eskimo; teacher, John H. Kil- 
buck. School was kept for two hundred days; attendance, 34 boarding pupils. 
Each pupil is provided, at the expense of the school, with two suits of clothing, a 
fur “‘parka,” a fur cap, a pair of seai-skin mittens lined with wool, and from two 
to three pairs of fur boots, per year. 
The diet at the school table consists of dried salmon, frozen fish and game, bread, 
tea, sugar, beans, and salted salmon. In the spring the boys are allowed to go to 
the mountains and trap for fur, which gives them experience and also helps them 
earn a portion of their living. - : 
At a later point in this report is included an interesting account sent by Mrs, Kil- 
buck, concerning Shamanism and sorcery in this valley. 
Carmel contract school.—Moravian; population, Eskimo; teacher, F. E. Wolff. 
The school was kept from August 19, 1891, to June 7, 1892, with an average daily 
attendance of 18 boarding pantie 
Outside of the school hours the pupils were taught in the various industries suited 
to their position. 
Much difficulty is found in keeping the pupils regularly under the influence of the 
school, as on one pretext after another the parents, not recognizing the value of 
regularity in school work, are disposed to take them off on fishing and hunting éxpe- 
ditions. 
Several families came from distant sections to Carmel, that they might have the 
advantage of the school for their children.

  876 “EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Unalaska contract school.—Methodist; population, Aleuts; John A. Tuck, teacher; enrollment, 35. This place was selected by the missionary society ot the Methodist 
Episcopal Church as the center of their church operations in Alaska, on June 28, 1883. Owing to a combination of circumstances, work was not commenced until the summer of 1889, when Mr. and Mrs, John A. Tuck were sent out to establish a school and mission home. 
In 1890 the home was commenced by the bringing of 2 orphan waifs, girls, from 
the island of Attou, 1,009 miles west of Unalaska. ‘The teachers were in a small one 
and one-half story cottage (half of which was used as a schoolroom), and were 
unprepared to receive any children into their family. But under the circumstances 
the waifs had to be received, whether convenient or not. Other girls, finding thas 2 had actually been received, also came and refused to be driven away, and some 
weeks later Capt. M. A. Healy, commanding the U. S. 8. Bear, brought down 6 orphan 
girls from the Seal Islands. Thus the school has grown and grown until 26 girls 
have been received. 
The character and efficiency of the school can be judged by the following letter, 
received by the general agent from Capt. M. A. Healy: 
REVENUE MARINE STEAMER BEAR, 
Port of Unalaska, Alaska, November 9, 1892. 
Dear Sir: I have broughv 6 girls from the Seal Islands to the Jesse Lee School; two years ago I 
brought down alike number. I am constrained by this part I have had in providing scholars for the 
school to give you my views of its character and accomplishments, with the hope that they excite interest in its behalf among its founders and supporters. In all my experience in the country I have seen nothing that has rendered so much good to the people. From its situation, it has tributary to it this whole western end of the Territory where there are numbers of children and poor waifs, many the offspring of white fathers, growing up with- out the care of homes or the education and training of Christian parents. 
Prof. and Mrs. Tuck have labored zealously and well to teach the scholars the necessities and 
requirements of decent living, and have trained them to become good housekeepers and proper wives and mothers. But they are cramped by the means and accomodations at hand. ‘The school is already crowded to its utmost capacity, and can not take many whom it would be a mercy to givo its pro- tection, and who could be received with a suitable building and support. 
Lam sure the ladies of the Methodist society, could they understand the conditions and field of the 
school and how well it is conducted, would become interested in its behalf and provide 1t with better 
facilities with which to continue and enlarge its work for the elevation of these poor, neglected mem- 
bers of their sex. a 
Ican not be accused of bias, for I am of an entirely different religious belief. Prof. and Mrs. Tuck 
mow nothing of my writing.’ Iam prompted by my interest in the country and the improvement of its people, and can not remain blind to good to humanity by whomever performed. Sincerely yours, - M. A. HEALY, 
Captain U.S. Revenue Marine.

Sitka contract school.—Presbyterian. In the sping of 1885, 35 picked young men, 
between the ages of 16 and 25 years, were taken from Mr. Duncan’s colony at Met- 
lakahtla into the industrial training school at Sitka. After a period of four years 
22 have left the school. Out of the 35,in addition to the ordinary studies of the 
schoolroom, 21 have learned to speak and read the English language; 21 have 
become good musicians and singers; 5 have learned to play on the cabinet organ; 9 
have become members of the school brass band; 13 of the 35 were tobacco chewers 
and smokers before entering school, but after entering tho school none of the others 
learned the habit; 7 learned the shoemaker’s trade; 8 became carpenters; 4, black- 
smiths; 2, coopers; 2, steamboat engineers; 4, house painters; 1, printer; 1, pho- 
tographer; 6 had a training in a sawmill; and 3 became tailors. 
Metlakahtla contract: school.—This model settlement under the fostering care of 
Mr. William Duncan, the veteran missionary, continues to flourish. There are now 
about 100 neat frame houses in the village; the output of the saimon cannery last 
season was about 6,000 cases; it is the intention to increase its capacity to at least 
20,000 cases. The other principal industries are a saw and planing mill whieh fur- 
nish all the Jumber needed in the vicinity. Of Metlakahtia one of the tourists 
writes: - 
“Metlakahtla is truly the full realization of the missionaries’ dream of aboriginal 
restoration. The church is architecturally pretentious and can seat 1,200 persons, 
It has a belfry and spire, vestibule, gallery across the front, groined arches and pul- 
pit carved by hand, organ and choir, Brussels carpet in the aisles, stained glass win- 
dows, and all the appointments and embellishments ofa first-class sanctuary; and 
it is wholly native handiwork. The dwelling houses are neat and attractive. They 
have inclosed flower gardens and macadamized sidewalks 10 feet wide along the 
entire street. ‘The women weave cloth for garments, and the people dress tastefully 
in modern garb.”

KADIAK DISTRICT. 
Kadiak.—C. C. Solter, teacher; enrollment, 69; population, Russian Creoles. Mr. 
Solter writes: ‘I opened school on the 8th of September. The number enrotled the 
first day was 27. The appearance of the children impressed me favorably. All 
came neatly dressed and clean; their faces showed signs of intelligence and they 
very soon showed their desire to learn. Most of the pupils are anxious to be on 
time in the morning, and some frequently went without their breakfast rather than 
be tardy. On the whole the school has made as rapid progress as could be expected. 
All that were regular in attendance have done well, while some have done exceed- 
ingly well. The deportment of my pupils has been such as to deserve commenda- 
tion. I have never seen a class of better behaved children than I have in my school, 
and consequently the government of the same has not been a very difficult task. 
We had an entertainment at the close of school, which was quite a success. The 
visitors enjoyed the exercises very much, especially the singing, and were loud in 
their praises. The children take the greatest delight in singing, and as I have 
secured the use of an organ for next winter, a lively time is expected. I am study- 
ing the Russian language and shall soon be able to converse with the parents in 
their own tongue.” 
Afognak.—Mrs. C. M. Colwell, teacher; enrollment, 35; population, Russian 
Creoles. The prevalence of an epidemic during the early part of the year inter- 
fered greatly with the attendance upon school. There is a great deal of poverty in 
the district in which Afognak is situated, and the teacher in the kindness of her 
heart frequently supplied her pupils with material as well as intellectual food. She 
writes that here, as in all the other schools in Alaska, the children aro bright and 
anxious to learn. 
Unga.—O. R. McKinney, teacher; enrollment, 33; population, Russian Creoles, 
Mr. McKinney writes: ‘‘I was greatly encouraged by the personal appearance of the 
pupils and by the interest they took in their studies after I had started them in their 
work. It took me some time to get them to talk to me or even to speak English at 
all, although I knew that some of them could speak English quite well. I overcame 
this by degrees, however, and then forbade them to speak either in Russian or Aleut. 
The result of this is that they now talk to each other in English instead of Russian. 
They have advanced much more rapidly than I expected.” 
SITKA DISTRICT. 
Juneau No. 1.—Lilly O. Reichling, teacher; enrollment, 26; population, Americans. 
Owing to the fact that a number of parents whoso children had attended school 
moved away from the town during the year, the number of pupils enrolled was 
slightly smaller than during the previous year. However, the seating capacity of 
the present school house is severely taxed, but the narrow limits of the Congres- 
sional appropriation made it impossible to erect a larger building. 
Juneau No. 2.—Mrs. W. 8. Adams, teacher; enrollment, 75; population, Thlingets. 
Mrs. Adams is enthusiastic in her commendation of the aptitude of the native chil- 
dren. She writes: ‘‘ The year has been a profitable one, and the influence of educa- 
tion is plainly discernible in the intelligent faces of the little brown children. We 
have a special day set apart for visitors, and those who come express surprise and 
admiration at the intelligence displayed by our pupils. The children have formed 
themselves into a society, elect their own officers, conduct their own meetings, and 
do it in a manner that astonishes people who visit the school.” 
Dougias No. 1.—Mrs. A. M. Clark, teacher; enrollment, 25; population, American. 
The Treadwell gold mine, the largest gold mine in Alaska, is situated upon Douglas 
Island, and this school is attended by the children of the miners employed there. 
Mrs. Clark displayed great energy in interesting and advancing the pupils under 
her care, During the year a literary entertainment was held, the proceeds of which 
were used in purchasing an organ for the use of the school. 
Douglas No. 2.—Miss Millie Mohler, teacher; enrollment, 24; population, Thlingets. 
The majority of the children in regular attendance upon this school are inmates of 
the home maintained upon Douglas Island by the Friends’ Mission, Miss Mohler 
writes: ‘In addition to other studies I have taught sewing to boys and girls alike. 
They pieced and quilted a patchwork quilt that would have done credit to our 
grandmothers, besides mending clothes and working in letters and cardboard.” 
Killisnoo.—K. M. Calvin, teacher; enrollment, 33; population, Thlingets and 
Russian Creoles. 
Sitka No. 1.—Miss Cassia Patton, teacher; enrollment, 59; population, Americans 
and Russian Creoles. This school is attended by the children of the Government 
officials at Sitka, and the teacher being one of the most experienced and efficient in 
the Territory, the school is one of the most satisfactory in Alaska.

878 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Sitka No.2.—Mrs. Lena Vanderbilt, teacher; enrollment,54; population, Thlingets. 
Here, as elsewhere in the Territory, irregularity in attendance was the greatest 
drawback to progress. The Thlingets are a sociable people. During the spring the 
natives visit their friends in the neighboring settlements, and at that season the 
beautiful waters of the magnificent fjords are covered with canoes carrying whole 
villages of natives—men, women, and children, on social pleasures bent. Later in 
the season hunting and fishing expeditions are in order. Carelessness as to prompt 
attendance is also a great discouragement to the teacher. Mrs. Vanderbilt writes: 
“While many of the natives have clocks in their houses, few of them are ever wound 
up, and when they are a very small number keep anything like the correct time. 
The increase in attendance during the winter was due to a great extent to the exer- 
tions of the local school committee, who visited the native villages from time to 
time in the interests of the schools. 
“The natural intelligence of the native children, the general interest they show 
while in school, and the advancement many of them have made are all matters of 
encouragement to the teacher. Some have advanced far enough to appreciate the 
yalue of their studies, and I expect that gradually the influence of their advance- 
ment upon the other children who do not attend school will be very beneficial. 
“I desire to note the uniformly good behavior of the pupils while in the school 
room. ‘They seldom require reproof or correction; they are generally attentive and 
give me no trouble whatever.” 
Wrangell.—Miss E. Tolman, teacher; enrcllment, 49; population, Thlingets. Miss 
Tolman writes: ‘‘When I entered upon my duties my hopes for the rapid advance- 
ment of the class before me were not very bright. Perhaps it was because I realized 
the extent of the undertaking that the results uf my efforts have surpassed my 
brightest expectations. Be that as it may, my opinion of the brain power of the 
natives of Alaska has materially changed since I have become acquainted with it. 
Those of my class who have mastered the art of how to study have dono remarkably 
well. Not only have they done well in their regular lessons from books, but they 
manifest great interest in various subjects that I introduce as a change.” 
Jackson.—Mrs. Clara G. Gould, teacher; enrollment, 100; population, Hydah. 
This school is the most isolated in southeast Alaska. During the seven years of its 
existence it has been under the charge of Mrs. McLeod, who thoroughly understands 
the dispositions of the natives, and she has succeeded wonderfully well in training 
and elevating the younger natives at Jackson. 
Haines.—Rev. W. W. Warne, teacher; enrollment, 89; population, Thlingets. Mr. 
Warne writes: ‘‘The school has made better progress than I could have expected. 
Indeed, I feel quite delighted with some of the results. Some of my scholars have 
certainly made excellent progress. Those who commenced last fall did not know the 
alphabet, and by the end of the term were well along in the second reader, Every- 
body seems friendly and glad to have the school.” 
MISSION SCHOOLS OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND. 
Rey. T, H. Canham, who for the past year kept a good school at the mouth of the 
Tanana, has this fall removed several hundred miles up the river to Fort Selkirk, 
where he intends opening a new school. 
‘The school at Buxton will probably be conducted by Bishop Bompas, assisted by 
Dr. Toty. 
Tur Kririinc or CuarLtes H, EDWARDS AND THE OUTRAGE UPON J. E. CONNETT. 
In August, 1891, a schoolhouse was built and a school established at Kake vil- 
lage, an isolated settlement on Kupreanoff Island, about 100 miles south of Douglas 
Island, in a wild region quite beyond the influences of civilization. The school was 
given in charge of Mr. Charles H. Edwards, who had been very successful as teacher 
of the native school at Douglas. In his new field he was 50 miles from the nearest 
white man. Among the supplies furnished to Mr. Edwards were an organ and a 
stereopticon, and he soon succeeded in attracting the natives. In ashort time the 
small schoolhouse was filled to its utmost capacity, and it became necessary te 
divide the school into three sections. In the morning the small children came and 
kindergarten work oceupied their attention; in the afternoon reading and writing 
were taught to the young people, and in the evening a session was held at which no 
books were used, the efforts of the teacher being directed to giving his pupils prac- 
tice in conversing in English. 
It was not long before troubles came. Whisky found its way into the village. In 
one of his letters Mr. Edwards writes: 
“Yes; Iam lonely. Nota white face have IJ seen since our steamer left us. Two 
nights ago a canoe brought in quite an amount of whisky, One chief and all his 
retinue were gloriously drunk. All night long they kept up an infernal hammering
-P-A-G-E-249
    REPORT ON EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 879 
on an Indian drum, and the maudlin voices of men and women mingled m savage 
songs. I could not sleep. Next morning I went around to see what was the matter, 
and such a sight as met my eyes! Half nude human beings in all attitudes, their 
staring, intoxicated eyes reminding one of an insane asylum. The only thing you 
can do with a drunkenman is to let him soberup. No impression made upon himis 
lasting. So I let them finish their revel, as they could get no drunker. Since they 
have sobered up they are ashamed to speak tome. I am becoming an ultra whisky 
hater.” 
The account of the final tragedy and subsequent occurrences is best given in the 
words of the examiner who, under instructions of the Department of Justice, inves- 
tigated the matter: 
“Toward the evening of January 10, 1892, a sloop with Maicolm Campbell and 
Emery Elliott on board came into the harbor about 3 miles from the Indian village, 
and commenced trading whisky to the Indians. What Mr. Edwards knew concern- 
ing this illicit traffic we shall never know; suffice it to say that an Indian named 
Squanish purchased $5.50 of whisky from them, which, when Mr. Edwards found out, 
he poured into the bay. They offered his interpreter, Jimmie Coffin, whisky to 
drink, but he refused. They gave Tah a hoo whisky to drink and he drank it. They 
gave whisky to the six or eight Indians who went in advance of Mr. Edwards’ party 
and went into the cabin of the sloop. Mr. Edwards had been frequently annoyed 
by the results of the sale of liquor to the Indians, and his own life had many times 
been jeopardized. He therefore resolved to see with his own eyes and convince him- 
self that the parties then in the harbor with thesloop were violating the laws of the 
Jand, and if they were that he would exercise his right as a citizen and his duty 
under the laws of Oregon to arrest them and take them forthwith with all speed to 
Wrangel and thero deliver them up to the authorities. For this purpose he called 
a meeting of the Kake Indians at the school house; he informed them of the objects 
of the meeting. After opening the meeting with a song he requested 14 volunteers 
to assist him in finding out whether these men on the sloop were actually violating 
the law or not, and, if they were, to go prepared t6 arrest them and start immediately 
to Wrangel—not armed to the teeth nor with handcufis—but with small cords in 
his pockets, to bind them safely and conduct them thither. 
“A canoe with the larger number of the volunteers proceeded to the sloop under 
his directions to find out what was being done on board, and he followed himself in 
a smaller canoe with the rest of the volunteers. When he arrived at the sloop the 
Indians who had preceded him were engaged in drinking whisky furnished by the 
oceupants of the sloop. Mr. Edwards was particular to see for himself that the 
Indians were drinking. He was particular to know that it was whisky they wero 
drinking. Then he gave orders to bind the twomen. The cabin was small, and with 
the two men and the six or more Indians in it there was not much chance to do any- 
thing. The Indians informed him that the men were getting the advantago of them 
then he had those Indians on the outside who could not get in tear the roof off the 
the cabin, and he threw down the ropes he had with him to bind them. This hav- 
ing been done he vegan to clear the sloop forsailing. He had the anchor raised and 
requested all the Indians to leave the sloop and return to the village, leaving him 
only and two Indians to man the sloop. He had the Indians take on shore with 
them a revolver and arifle, presuming no doubt that they were all the firearms on 
board. These he ordered to be placed in the schoolhouse. The Indians also took a 
field-glass and the keg, which was partially filed with whisky. When alone on the 
sloop with these two Indians and the two desperate smugglers he had not counted 
on the possibility of any more firearms being on board, but Malcolm Campbell, the 
owner of the sloop, managed to get his left hand loose, reached under the foot of the: 
bed and got arevolver, andshotat Mr. Edwards three several times, mortally wound- 
ing him, and immediately thereafter shot the other two Indians, one with the 
revolver, so that he jumped into the water and never afterward was seen or heard of. 
The other while attempting to escape by swimming was shot at with his rifle and 
he was never more seen or heard of. Campbell’s associate on the sloop, Emery Elli- 
ott, managed to get his hands loose and cut the cords which bound Campbell’s feet, 
and thus both were liberated. They then proceeded to get away from the place. 
They tound the anchor already up, and they said that they attempted to make 
Wrangel with the wounded man, but they said the winds were contrary. They next 
tried to make Juneau, but met with a head wind and could not. They, however, 
reached a point near Point Gardner. After this they sailed for Killisnoo and were 
there met by Dan Campbell, a retail liquor dealer of Douglas City, who with 
another party started out of Douglas in another sloop hunting for them, fearing from 
their long absence that they had met with an accident or been captured. Here 
Jimmie Blaine saw the wounded man, Mr. Edwards, all but unconscious, he being 
the only known white man, other than Campbell and Elliott, who saw Mr. Edwards 
alive and conscious, or partially so, after receiving his wound. Here he was fur- 
nished with the only food he obtained since receiving the wounds three days before,
-P-A-G-E-250
  880 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
yet strange to say, this man Jimmie Blaine was never called upon to testify in any 
of the cases or at the coroner’s inquest. 
“The object of their devious sailing was accomplished. The victim was uncon- 
scious, no ante-mortem statement could be got from him; dead men, or unconscious 
men, tellno tales. They arrived at Sitka about thirty-six hours after the infliction 
of the wounds, and the victim died about ten hours thereafter. 
“*\ coroner’s inquest was held over the remains, but the only testimony produced. 
before the jury was that of the physicians as to the cause of his death, the clerk of 
the court as to the identity of the remains, and the testimony of the self-confessed 
murderer and his accomplice as to the manner of his receiving the wounds which 
caused his death. Tho jury, in writing, asked for further testimony, but none was 
furnished; they ask for instructions, but they are informed by the U.S. commis- 
sioner, cx officio coroner, that instructions are useless; that it is simply a case of 
piracy—piracy on the high seas. And, of course, Malcolm Campbell is justified in 
tho deed.” 
Subsequently, Malcolm Campbell and Emery Elliott were convicted of giving 
liquor to Indians and were fined $40 each, in satisfaction of which Malcolm Camp- 
bell served in jail six days and paid $28, and Emery Elliott was confined in jail ten 
days and paid $20. 
Campbell was also held for manslaughter in the sum of $1,000, but his case when 
presented to the grand jury at Juneau was ignored by them. 
For writing a statement of the whole affair, Dr. James E. Connett, of the Friends’ 
mission at Douglas, was waited upon by a band of masked outlaws, called out of 
bed at about midnight on April 24, upon the pretext that a miner had been badly 
injured and needed surgical attendance, and deliberately tarred and feathered. 
As soon as the miners at the Treadwell mines, Douglas City, heard how Dr. Con- 
nett had been outraged, they held a meeting and resolved to raise $500 to assist in 
bringing to justice the perpetrators of the crime. However, no efforts were made 
by the officials to ferret out the matter.

SUPERVISION. 
In accordance with your instructions, and by the courtesy of the honorable Sec- 
retary of the Treasury and Capt. L. G. Shepard, acting chief of the Revenue Marine 
Division, I was allowed transportation on the U: 8. 8. Bear, Capt. M. A. Healy, com- 
manding. On the 2d of May, 1892, I started for my third summer’s work on the 
coast of Siberia and Arctic Alaska. We reached Unalaska on the 22d of May, where 
I found the school in a flourishing condition. From Unalaska we proceeded to the 
Seal Islands, where I secured the statistics of the schools kept by the North Amer- 
ican Commercial Company, a statement of which has already been given. From 
the Seal Islands we went to St. Matthew Island, where the captain rescued one of a 
party of three who had been left on the island the preceding season for the purpose 
of hunting polar bear. The other two men were not founé, and are supposed to 
have been drowned. From St. Matthew Island the ship passed directly over to Cape 
Navarin, Siberia, which was reached on the 6th of June. It was the intention to 
have secured a load of reindeer at this point, but the surf was so heavy that no land- 
ing could be made. 
From Cape Nayarin a course was taken to the settlement on the northwest point 
of St. Lawrence Island, where the village and schoolhouse were inspected. From 
St. Lawrence Island we attempted again to make the coast of Asia in the neighbor- 
hood of Indian Point, but, being headed off by the great fields of ice, the captain 
changed his course and attempted to make King Island, in doing which he got fast 
in the ice, and was only able to reach the mission school at Cape Prince of Wales. 
But, after being kept three days a prisoner in the ice, the captain determined to 
break his way through. The shocks received made the ship tremble from bow to 
stern. In attempting to force his way through the ice, he broke one of the blades of 
the propeller, but by continuous work finally reached clear water to the eastward, 
and on the 15th of June moored the ship to a large field of ice off Kadiak Island.

REPORT ON EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 885 
This was the village that last September we found to be in a starving condition, 
but the food so generously issued by Capt. Healy had tided them over until the seal 
and the walrus came in their vicinity, so that we found them in good condition. 
Being anxious to ascertain the fate of the teacher at Cape Prince of Wales, an effort 
was made to reach that point through the ice. After great difficulty in ramming 
his way through the ice, we came on the morning of the 16th of June within 4 
miles of the place where, the ice being too solid for further progress, the captain 
very reluctantly turned and made for Golovin Bay, where it had been reported that 
some miners were out of provisions and in a starving condition. At Golovin Bay 
communication was opened with the miners. While waiting for the party to get 
ready to sail, a flying trip was made to St. Michael, where the teachers, missionaries, 
and traders along the great Yukon River were waiting for the annual vessel and 
supplies from San Francisco. On the 21st of June the miners at Golovin Bay were 
taken on board, and on the 22d taken to St. Michael. While at St. Michael I had an 
opportunity of conferring with the teachers and examining some of the pupils of the 
various schools. 
The annual arrival of the steamer bringing missionaries and traders from up the 
Yukon River 2,000 miles is the great event of the year at St. Michael. The river 
steamer Arctic is here met by the ocean steamer St. Paul, from San Francisco, and. 
for a week or two this little settlement, cut off from the world eleven months in the 
year, is a scene of bustling activity. The furs of all northern and central Alaska are 
athered here for shipment to market, and the provisions and trade goods of civil- 
ization for the coming year are brought up for distribution in the interior. Itis a 
unique gathering, the only one of the kind that now takes place in the United States. 
From oyer into the British possessions, Fort Selkirk, 2,000 miles or more up theriver, 
comes Mr. A. Harper, a pioneer trader, who has been 20 yearsin the country. Business 
is so brisk that he is proposing to establish a branch store 200 miles farther up the 
stream, which will bring him within a few hundred miles of the settlements of south- 
eastern Alaska. It is believed that a mail route should be established across the 
country from Juneau to the mines on the Yukon. A mail not exceeding 250 pounds 
weight could be carried for, making four trips a year, at a rate not to exceed $1,500 
the round trip. The best route is over the White Pass, which comes out on the 
Yukon at Windy Arm Lake. There is timber along the whole route, Winter on the 
Upper Yukon lasts from September to May. Rey. and Mrs. T. 11. Canham, of Fort 
Adams, will open a new station there this fall. 
In the United States Postal Guide is Mitchell Post-Office, Alaska. I do not believe 
that over 100 of the 60,000,000 American citizens, if asked, could designate its loca- 
tion on the map. It is 1,400 miles above the mouth of the Yukon, near the junction 
of Forty Mile Creek with the Yukon River, and is the only post-office for the coun- 
try for 1,000 miles around. The postmaster is Mr. L. N. (Jack) McQueston, the 
trader, another pioneer trader of twenty years’ standing. The office receivesa chance 
mail from the States once ortwiceayear. The salary amounts to from $2 to $3 per year. 
Last winter 108 men wintered at Forty-Mile Creek, which, by the way, isa river hun- 
dreds of miles long. Mr. McQueston raised 9 tons of turnips. Barley and oats grow 
and ripen well. A frost on the 7th of August, 1891, killed the potatces. The placer 
gold mines in the neighborhood of this trading post yield from $75,000 to $80,000 
worth of gold dust each season. It would be money well expended towards the devel- 
opment of the country if Congress would make an appropriation for opening up a 
trail from the coast at Chilcat to the headwaters of the Yukon, and give the hardy 
miners a more frequent mail. 
Near the trading station, on the cast side of Forty-Mile Creck and south side of the 
Yukon River, is Buxton, the location of St. John’s Mission of the English Church. 
This mission was established in 1888, the first missionary being Rey. J. W. Elling- 
ton. In 1890, through privations and hardships, he became insane, and in 1891 was 
returned to his friends'in England. His station will be occupied by Right Rev. 
Bompas, Bishop of McKenzie River, for two years at Fort Adams. ~ 
Rampart House: This is a Church of England Mission and a Hudson's Bay Com- 
pany’s trading station on the Porcupine River, one of the tributaries of the Yukon. 
It was established in 1874. During the international boundary survey, by Messrs. 
Turner and McGrath in 1890-91, it was found to be 20 miles within tho lines of the 
United States. Consequently, in 1891 the place was moved 20 miles farther up 
the river to get within the British jurisdiction. In the summer of 1891 Rey. C. C. 
Wallis went by the way of San Francisco to England, returning this season. 
Fort Yukon: The old buildings at Fort Yukon have been taken down by the Alaska 
Commercial Company, and the logs cut up for fuel for the steamer’s furnaces. 
On the Upper Yukon, last winter, fish gaye out in January, and tho natives sub- 
sisted on rabbits. On the Keokuk, above Nulato, 3 or 4 died of starvation. One 
native subsisted on soup made from an old bearskin. 
St. James’ Mission, at old Fort Adams, was established by Rev. T. Hf. Canham, of 
the Church of England, in 1888. Mrs. Canham was the first white woman to cross

the Rocky Mountains north of the Arctic Cirele in winter. This sho did with her 
husband on snow-shoes in 1888. The mission is 4 miles up the Yukon, on the north 
side of the mouth of Tonikokat River and 18 miles below the mouth of the Tanana, 
In 1891 Rey. J. L. Prevost was sent to this station by the Missionary Society of the 
Methodist Episcopal Church. Mr. and Mrs. Canham remained with him during the 
winter, and this summer removed to Buxton, leaving Mr. Prevost in sole charge of 
the station. At this school, the greatest attendance was 67, the least 15, and the 
average 32. During the winter of 1891~92 they had 67 pupils in school; average 
daily attendance, 23. There are about 800 natives in Tanana Valley; about 200 on 
the Yukon, between Tanana and the boundary ; about 100 permanently at Fort Adams, 
and about 75 at Tanana Station. 
Tanana Trading Station: This station is 8 miles down the Yukon River from St. 
James’ Mission, and is kept by Mr. G. C. Bettles. This station is the winter head- 
quarters of the miners on the Koy-u-Kuk River. 
St. Peter Claver’s Mission (Roman Catholic Church) is on the northwest bank of 
the Yukon River, at the old American station, about 2} miles above the mouth of 
the Nulato River. There is also a trading station here, kept by a creole, H. Koker- 
ine, who has’been a resident of Alaska for forty years. 
Anvik is the seat of Christ Church Mission of the Protestant Episcopal Church— 
on the south side of Anvik River and west side of the Yukon, at the junction. It 
was established in 1887 by Rey. Octavius Parker and Rey. John W. Chapman. Mr. 
Parker retired in 1889, and in 1890 Mr. Marcus O. Cherry was sent in his place. Mr. 
Cherry returns to the States this fall. The trading. station is in charge of Dennis 
Belkoff, a Sitka creole. 
Kozorifzky, Holy Cross Mission (Roman Catholic Church) is on the north bank of 
the Yukon, directly opposite the mouth of Shageluk Slough. This is their largest 
establishment in the Yukon River Valley, a school of 80 boarders, in charge of the 
following sisters of St. Ann (Mother House started in 1850, near Montreal), Mother 
Superior Mary Stephens, Sisters Mary Zephrena, Mary Prudence, Mary Joseph, Mary 
Englebert,and Mary Paulena. Father Tosiin1891 raised 40 bushels of potatoes at the 
station, besides turnips (one of his turnips weighed 17 pounds and another 154 
pounds) and cabbages. 
Ikogmut, Russo-Greek Mission, Rev. Zacharias N. Belkoff, priest. 
Eight miles up the Yukon River from Anfreieffski and on the Kon-e-Kova River, 2 
miles above its mouth, is a trading station (north side), kept by Charles Peterson. 
At Kublik (mouth of Yukon) is a station kept by a Kamkoff creole. 
Unalacleet is a Swedish mission, composed of Rev. Axel E. Karlson, August Ander- 
son, David Johnson, and Hannah Swenson. They had 72 children in school last win- 
ter, with an average attendance of 22. They also have a dozen or more boarders, 
and will enlarge their buildings this season. They are also. talking of a station at 
Golovin Bay. 
At Unalacleet is a living house, one and one-half stories high, 25 by 22 feet. The 
kitchen is 25 by 20 feet. The schoolhouse is two stories high, 20 by 22 feet. The 
workshop is 25 by 20 feet. There are a bath house and stables and several store 
houses. Four acres of ground are cleared up, upon which they will this year raise 
70 bushels of potatoes. They have 2 bulls, 2 cows, and 3 goats. 
Father Tosi, of the Roman Catholic Church, has selected a new site for a boarding- 
school, near Kusilvak Mountain, near the mouth of the Yukon River. He reports 
1,500 natives as living between Cape Vancouver and the mouth of the Yukon. 
Having transported the missionaries to St. Michael on the 23d of June, another 
start was made for Cape Prince of Wales, we anchoring in the port cf Clarence on 
June 25, where we met Mr. W. T. Lopp, the teacher at Cape Prince of Wales. 
While at anchor at Cape Prince of Wales, the steam whaler Newport arrived from 
San Francisco, haying on board Mr. and Mrs. Thornton and Miss Kittridge, for the 
mission school at Cape Prince of Wales; Mr. McClellan, a carpenter, for the erection 
of additional buildings at that point; Dr. Beaupre, for the Mission station at Point 
Barrow; also Messrs. Miner W. Bruce and Bruce Gibson, for the Reindeer Station. 
On the 28th of June, having been transferred to the steamer Newport, I visited the 
school and station at Cape Prince of Wales. 
On the 29th of June I went ashore on what is known as the watering station, as 
the northeast side of Port Clarence Bay, and selected a site for the central and first 
reindeer station. A piece of driftwood had been set in the ground, with an empty 
barrel at its base, as a signal for ships. Upon this trunk of a tree we nailed our flag. 
A tent was borrowed from the missionaries at Cape Prince of Wales and another was 
furnished by Capt. Healey, which were kept on the spot to shelter the goods and 
supplies which a few hours afterward were landed from the steamer Newport. Port 
Clarence, which was known as Kaviayak Bay, was explored by Capt. Beechy, in 
August, 1829, and was named after the British King, then Duke of Clarence. The 
inner harbor was named after Lord Grantley, and Points Spencer and Jackson after 
distinguished officers of the royal navy. Port Spencer, at the extremity of a low

sand spit which extends some 10 miles from the coast, forms the southern and west- 
ern side of the harbor. This sand spit is low and marshy, with numerous lakes, 
From Point Spencer to Point Jackson, a distance of 2 miles, is the entrance to the 
bay The northern and eastern shore of the bay rises from the sea to the mountains. 
Along the seashore are numerous lagoons and small lakes which, in their season, are 
covered with numerous wild fowl. The bay, in extent, is about 12 miles from east 
to west and 14 miles from north to south. At the extreme eastern end two narrow 
sand spits, extending from the northern and southern shores, inclose an inner har- 
bor, called Grantley Harbor. The entrance is about one-third of a mile across. It 
extends about 9 miles from east to west and 3 miles from north tosouth. At the 
eastern end of Grantley Harbor is a second strait, about 300 yards wide, which con- 
nects with a third body of water or inland lake, called by the natives Imourouk. 
Into this lake empty two rivers, the Aghee-ee-puk and Coy-vee-arak. Along this 
line of water courses is an inland road to Grantley Bay and Norton Sound. To the 
north of Grantley Harbor Mus-ik-a-charne Peak rises to a height of 1,600 feet. At 
the head of the sand spit between Port Clarence and Grantley Harbor is a large 
lagoon, and between the reindeer station, at the beach, and the pass through the 
highlands, on the north, are about a thousand fresh-water ponds, or small lakes, At 
the extreme northeast corner of Port Clarence, near Grantley Harbor, and upon a 
small mountain creek, I selected the location of the-headquarters of the reindeer 
station. A few miles distant from Grantley Harbor was the former location of the 
headquarters for this region of the Russo-American Telegraph Exploration of 1865 
and 1867. The shores of the sound on the site of the reindeer station are formed of 
shingle, or water-worn stones. These shingled beaches become a marked character- 
istic of large sections of the coast in northern Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean. Of late 
years it has become the favorite rendezvous of the whaling fleet that gathers here 
about July 1 to await the arrival of a vessel from San Francisco with fresh pro- 
visions, coal, lumber, etc. It also enables them to ship the spring catch of whale- 
bone to San Francisco before entering the dangerous Arctic. Upon my first visit, 
about July 2, 1890, twenty-five whalers were at anchor off Port Spencer, awaiting the 
arrival of the ship. On June 30 Ireturned on the Bear, and the next day the captain 
weighed anchor for South Head Sound, Lawrence Bay, Siberia. 
From 2 to 8 o’clock p.m. we steamed through broken ice, and at 11:45 p. m. 
dropped anchor off the village. An officer and some men were at once sent ashore, 
and by 6:30 a. m. the ship’s launch returned with the first load of reindeer. At this 
place we secured forty-one animals, also four native herders, who agreed to go with 
us and take charge of the herd on the American side. At4 o’clock on the afternoon 
the captain dropped down the coast some eight miles to another camp, where twelve 
additional deer were secured, and at midnight weighed anchor and stood north, 
steaming through heavy fields of ice. At 4:30 our Asiatic interpreter, Rainbow by 
name, was landed at North Head, and at 5:30 that evening the ship came to anchor 
off the reindeer station. The surf being too heavy, nothing was done that evening. 
Bright and early on the morning of the 4th of July (6 a. m.) the first boat-load of 
the first herd of domestic reindeer in Alaska and on the the continent of America 
was landed. The deer, with their fore feet tied together, were taken ashore in the 
ship’s launch and carried up from the beach on litters borne by the natives. The 
were then untied, hobbled, and turned loose. Three ran away and took to the hills, 
and the herders had a Jong chase; but they were finally recovered. One of the deer 
had his hind legs broken in Siberia and had to be killed. The ship was decorated 
with flags, in honor of the day. On the 5th of July Capt. Healy very kindly had 
his carpenters make a flag-staff for the station, which was landed that same evening 
and placed in position, after which the Bear started again for Siberia. 
At noon, on the 6th of July, we anchored off Whalen, having been for an hour 
steaming through heavy fields of ice. Finding no reindeer in the vicinity of the 
village, anchor was weighed and the ship got under way, following the coast to the 
northwestward, coming to anchor two hours later off Enchowan, but at 10 o’clock 
was compelled to shift anchorage on account of the heavy fields of ice. The follow- 
ing day the ice compelled the captain to shift his position two or three times. At 
this place sixteen deer were procured and taken on board. At 9:40 anchor was 
again weighed and the start made for the reindeerstation, steaming all nightthrough 
heavy fog, and from 5 to 7 through heavy fields of ice, reaching Cape Spencer at 
5:40. On the 9th of July the ship America was towed in the harbor, having on 
board, among other things, lumber, coal, and supplies for the reindeer station. 
On the 10th the captain run down to the reindeer station, unloaded the reindecr, 
and also 240 packs of coal, and 77 cases of pilot bread, all of which he hadreceived 
from the bark Percy Edwards. On the 12th of July, going aboard the steamer Nevw- 
port, which had taken on board the lumber for the building at the reindeer stat- 
tion from the bark America, I returned again to the station and superintended the 
landing of the building, returning to the Bear on the 13th. 
On the 14th the Bear got under way for Siberia, from 1 to 2 p. m., steaming 
through large masses of broken ice. On the 15th we came to anchor off Cape
-P-A-G-E-258
888 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  Serdze Kamen, Siberia, in latitude north, 67° 27’; longitude east, 180° 20’. This 
cape is the northernmost limit of the explorations of Bering, he having reached here 
August 15, 1728. ‘The meaning of the name is “‘the heart of rock,” because of a fan- 
cied resemblance of a heart in the face of the rocky cape. Along the coast to the 
westward are several native villages. The mountain peaks in the back country rise 
to an elevation of from 2,000 to 5,000 feet. Fresh-water lakes inland and lagoons 
along the shore everywhere abound. After Bering, this shore was visited by Capt. 
Cook’s expedition in August 1778, when he struck the coast, coursing from Alaska 
as high northas North Cape. It was again visited on April 22, 1823, by Admiral von 
Wrangell in his fourth Siberian expedition. 
At 9:30 a. m. Assistant Engineer Falkenstein and Surgeon 8. J. Call went ashore 
after reindeer, bringing on board during the afternoon some twenty-one animals. 
The vessel was surrounded much of the time by heavy masses of drifting ice. The 
following day the captain was compelled to shift anchorage several times, the stock 
of his port anchor being carried away by the ice. On the 17th the ice became so 
heavy that the ship moored to an ice-floe and drifted with it. Towards night, some 
openings being discovered in the ice, the ship dropped down the coast slowly, forcing 
its way, until, about 4a. m., when it came to anchor again in the ice. At9 a.m. a 
large ice-floe bearing down upon the ship, anchor was again weighed, when it was 
found that a second anchor had been broken by theice. The 19th was spent in 
shifting anchor and dodging ice-floes. The surgeon and two seamen being ashore 
and unable to return to the vessel, the captain hired two native boys to cross the 
ice, with a launch for the party. In the evening, the wind having changed and 
loosened the ice somewhat, the surgeon returned with sixreindeer. Another attempt 
was made to start the engine and force the ship through the ice, but at midnight 
the attempt was given up. The starting and stopping the engine and drifting in 
heavy and closely packed ice were continued the following day until afternoon, 
when the ice became too heavy for further progress and the ship was allowed to 
drift. By constant ramming, towards night, there seeming to be a chance to get 
out, the ship was started again and by constantramming the heaviest ico was broken 
through, and by midnight clear water was reached, we having been shut up in the 
ice for a week. Coming abreast of the village of Utan, Siberia, a boat was sent 
ashore after Passaic, a noted deer-man, who resided there. He having come on 
board it was learned that his herd was three or four days distant. As a large ice- 
floo was seen bearing down upon us, and as we did not relish the idea of being 
imprisoned another week and perhaps wrecked in this bay, at 3:50 a. m. we were 
again under full sway, running a race with the ice, which was drifting down upon 
us, a solid, unbroken mass of ice, as far as the eye could reach. The ice rapidly 
gained upon us. Large, detached pieces like scours forged ahead of us, placing 
themselves directly in our path, against which we rammed and jarred, but at noon 
tho projecting cape of the bay was reached and passed just as the ice-floe was 
swinging upon it, barring further progress. During the forenoon we steamed 
through fog so denso that wo passed through Bering Straits before we knew it, and 
when the fog lifted found ourselves twenty miles ahead of the place where we sup- 
posed ourselycs tobe and at 10:30 that night came to anchor off the reindeer station. 
The reindeer on board were landed the following morning at 5:30 o’clock. In the 
afternoon the captain sent his carpenter and a boat’s crew ashore to prepare the 
foundations for the station house, and also sent a detachment on shore the following 
day, when, a storm having set in, the captain was compelled to shift anchor into 
deeper water. 
On Monday, July 25, we again got under way for North Head, Siberia, reaching 
Cape Puangoune, Siberia, at midnight. No one coming off from the village to the 
ship, and the weather beginning to be stormy, at 8:10 a. m. the anchor was weighed 
and tho ship steamed into anchor in Lutke Harbor, Siberia, at 9 o’clock. St. Law- 
rence Bay was so named by Capt. Cook because he first anchored in it on St. Lawrence 
day, August 10, 1778. The bay was fully surveyed by Capt. Lutke of the Russian 
navy in 1828. It is 11} miles across its mouth and extends inland about 24 miles. 
Its northeastern extremity is marked by a rounded top mountain, 1,794 feet high, 
called Cape Nouniagmo. On thesouthern slope is a native village of the same name, 
also known as North Head. From 5 to 6 miles from Cape Nouniagmo is Cape Pan- 
ougoun, which marks the commencement of the inner bay. Extending from Cape 
Panougoun is a bank of gravel cr shingle which forms Lutke Island and makes a 
sheltered cove 1} miles in diameter. This is a good anchorage for ships. In this 
cove the U.S. S. Briggs, in search of the Jeanette, was anchored for the winter, when 
she took fire and burned to the water's edge. There is a native village on this cove. 
While we were at anchor, waiting for the fog to lift and the storm to pass by, the 
surgeon and somo of the officers went ashore on Lutke Island and shot, in a few hours, 
106 cider ducks. On July 27, the gale having subsided, the ship got under way at 
7:30 in the morning, and, steaming out of Lutke Harbor, passed Cape Chargilach 
with its native village on the south side of the bay. We anchored at 10 off Cape  
-P-A-G-E-259

  Keleougoun. This cape is a bold, rock promontory, crowned with four mountain 
peaks, 1,542, 1,296, 1,257, and 1,206 feet high, respectively. A native village clings 
to the northeastern base, and a smaller one, cailed Jandonga, on its southwestern 
slope. Here the surgeon, Dr. Call, went ashore in the afternoon with a boat’s crew, 
procuring ten reindeer, The following day 56 more were procured and brought on 
board. At midnight the ship got under way, reaching the reindeer station at 5:30 
o'clock. On July 29 by 8:30 the deer were all on shore. On the 31st the captain 
again sent his carpenters and a detachment of men on shore to work at the station 
house. Towards night, a gale setting in, the ship was compelled to anchor out in 
deeper water. On Monday, August 1, the men that could be spared were again sent 
ashore to work at the buildings. 
At 4:15 a.m. on August 2 we again got under way for Siberia, and at 5:45 a.m. 
on the 3d of August came to anchor off Indian Point. Learning that there were 
no deer in the vicinity, we again got under way for East Head, at 1:25 p.m., stopping 
off a village near Bald Head. There being too much surf to land, we continued 
around Bald Head into Clover Bay, passing the mouth of Reindeer River, rounded 
Cape Haidamaik, and anchored in Port Providence, under Mount Slavianka (1,427 
feet), at 2:40 p.m. Three umniak loads of natives soon came over from the village 
on the sand spit. Learning that there was a herd of deer in the vicinity of Emma 
Harbor, Surgeon Call was placed in charge of a boat crew, and with an interpreter 
went to interview the reindeer men. Later in the afternoon a boat load of natives 
were hired and sent after Utoxia, who had gone to the head of the bay (14 miles) 
after seal. Both parties were out most of the night. Surgeon Call, upon his return, 
reported that the deer men on Emma Harbor had but few deer and would not sell 
any. Utoxia, upon his arrival, reported a large herd to the westward of the head 
of the bay. Clover Bay is narrow and runs between two parallel ranges of moun- 
tains from 1,000 to 2,300 feet high, with precipitous sides from the water up, while 
steep and bare mountains, flecked with great patches of snow, present a panorama 
of grand scenery. A bright sun and blue sky add to the enjoyment of the day, <s 
the steamer slowly picked her way along this memorable fiord. At 10:45 a.m. we 
were abreast of Cape Lakhatchov, the northern entrance of Emma Harbor, where the 
British ship Clover, Capt. Moon commanding, in search of Sir John Franklin, entered 
in 1848 and 1849. At 11:30 we passed Mount Kennicott (2,343 feet), so named in 
honor of Maj. Robert Kennicott, director of the Chicago Academy of Sciences, who 
was in charge of the Alaska expedition of the Russo-American telegraph expedition 
of 1865 and 1867. At noon we passed Cache Bay, and at 12:30 Long Harbor, which 
was the winter quarters of one party connected with the telegraph expedition. 
At1p.m.we came to anchor off Cape Ignatief, Vladimir Bay, Siberia. At once a 
party was organized, consisting of Dr. Call, the surgeon, Lieut. White, Assistant 
Engineer Falkenstein, and two natives, to visit the deer men. At the same time 
another party, consisting of Mrs. Healy, the wife of the captain, Engineer Broadbent, 
and myself, went down the bay 2 miles to visit the site of the telegraph expedition. 
The solid stone walls of the two houses occupied by them remained to mark the site, 
One was a cireular room about 20 feet in diameter, and the other a rectangular one 
9by 14 feet. The stone walls were about 4 feet high, symmetrically laid on the inside, 
and on the outside covered with earth. They were placed upon.the highest point* 
of a small, narrow peninsula, with the sea close to on three sides. . A few pieces of 
glass and copper were picked up as mementoes of the place; also some braces and 
knees of the native sleigh, made out of reindeer horn. ‘The land around was strewn 
with rusty hoops from barrels and casks. ‘Two or three lone graves told their own 
sad story. The land was dotted with beautiful wild flowers, and icy streams came 
down to the sea from large patches of snow that still remained upon the mountain 
sides. " | 
On the 5th of August, Dr. Calland party returned to the ship about 10a,m. They 
had been inland some 20 miles, but failed to find any deermen. On their way up 
the valley which leads inland from our anchorage they found frequent piles of chips, 
made in trimming the poles forty-five years before. The poles themselves had long 
disappeared, probably having been carried off by the natives. At noon we got under 
way for Holy Cross Bay, landing Utoxia as we passed Port Providence. The other 
native, Wallace, continued with us as interpreter. At 3:40 p. m. we rounded Cape 
Stoltz and stood up the north coast of the gulf of the Anadyr. The mouth of this 
gulf, from Cape Tchoukotskoi down the north to Cape Thaddeus on the south, is 200 
miles across, and the circuit of the gulf, without measuring the coast line of the 
smaller bays and indentations, is 420 miles. The first navigator to sail this sea was 
Capt. Bering, who was followed in 1826 and 1829 by Capt. Lutke, of the Russian 
navy. The north coast line is remarkable for its bold, rocky shore, in many places 
rising perpendicularly from the water’s edge. At 5p. m. we were abreast of Jak- 
kun, which is a high, steep bluff with a pyramidal rock. On we go parallel with 
the shore 10 miles distant past Cape Tchingan with its red band of rock running 
from summit to base. At10 p.m. we were off Cape Aggen, to the north of which is  
-P-A-G-E-260
890 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  Transfiguration Bay. From this up 9 miles to Cape Eumelian the coast is bounded 
by a high, perpendicular rock like a wall. About midnight we passed Cape Bering, 
where the bold, rocky shore ceases and small Tchuktchi villages are seen. - At 9a. 
m. on August 6 traces of ice began again to appear, and soon we were skirting a 
large field of floating ice. Walrus being discovered, the ship was stopped and the 
captain and surgeon went off, securing a large bull, which was brought on board and 
given the interpreter as part pay for his services. 
Along the northwestern coast of the gulf is a remarkable island, or false shore, 
which forms the southern portion of the Gulf of St. Croix. It is 45 miles long and but 
afew rods wide. A narrow, shallow canal separates this island from the mainland. 
There is a village of Tchuktchi near Cape Neetchk on the westernmost end, off which 
we were anchored several days during July, 1891. As we passed into Holy Cross 
Bay at noon a signal flag was seen floating at the village and two umniaks put off 
to intercept the ship. One of them was taken aboard, but when it was found that 
they wanted us to go to their village to trade ivory, the captain resumed his course 
towards the reindeer village on the west side of the bay, where we anchored at 2:50 
p.m. Holy Cross Bay is 54 miles from north to south and 35 miles from east to west. 
Its northern end is within 10 miles of the Arctic Circle and its shore line has a cir- 
cuit of 180 miles. Themouthof the bay is 13} miles across. At the northern end is 
Mount Matatchingai, with recky sides rising 9,180 feet. It is a landmark for the 
wholo region around. On the west side of Holy Cross Bay are large quantities of 
driftwood from the Andyr River. Soon after anchoring at the village 5 umniaks 
full of people come aboard. Inquiries were at once made for reindeer. At various 
times they represented the herds as close to and then as far off. They said that the 
herds had been driven down to the coast earlier in the summer, but the ship not 
being seen, had been driven back again into the country; that the mosquitoes were 
too bad to keep them near the water. At one time they would offer to sell a ship- 
load, then only promised 9 and then again 3. When they thought we wanted 
bucks they had only does to sell, and when they found we wanted does their herd 
was all bucks. They also asked two prices for what they proposed to sell, and then 
wanted additional pay for the prospective increase. If they sold a doe she would 
bear another the next season, and so on, increasing from year to year; while the 
cartridges and powder for which they traded would be used up and they would have 
nothing left. The captain met their argument with another, that if their deer 
should die next year they would have nothing and starve, while if they had car- 
tridges and powder they could shoot walrus and seal and live; or for what we could 
pay them they could trade with natives farther inland and get two deer from one. 
Finally, after five hours’ talk, the boat was lowered at 8:45 p.m. and Dr. Call, 
Assistant Engineer Falkenstein, the interpreter, and a crew of men were sent after 
the reindeer. In the vicinity of our anchorage was a temporary village of reindeer 
men. Every fall and spring they move all their household effects to and from the 
interior with their herd of deer. The village was their summer encampment by the 
sea. Around their neat looking tents were great quantities of deer harness and sleds, 
which were used in transportation. These Tchuktchi men cut their hair on the 
crown of the head, leaving a fringe around the head. Sometimes they leave a tuft 
in the center and have two rings of long hair. Sometimes a long lock of hair is 
left behind the ears, which is braided like a woman’s. Some have a small mark or 
figure totemed on the cheek, forehead, or some part of the face. This is said to be 
done upon the loss of a near relative, also to mark the number of seals killed. The 
women have their cheeks covered with totem marks. Some of the women have 
strings of beads dangling from the ears. August 7 proved a rainy, stormy, and 
dismal day. The fact that the boat that went off the night before had not 
returned excited considerable anxiety, but by midnight it came in sight and was 
soon alongside, with 12 deer. The men had been sixteen hours pulling against 
the tide and striving to reach the ship. While absent they had discovered a large 
tiver more than a mile across at its mouth. While pulling along the side of this 
viver they saw a bear and cubs. Pursuit was immediately made over streams and 
through swamps, and dodging from one hillock to another they crept up on their 
game. Cautiously raising their heads from behind the last hillock, with guns 
cocked, they found their supposed bear was a woman and children. At 5:30 a.m. 
on the 8th the cutter was sent ashore to gather moss and food. The deer men were 
put off, and at 8 o’clock we got under way, encountering a little floating ice in 
passing out of the bay. At 6:15 a.m.on August 9 we left our interpreter at the 
native village on Clover Bay, and at 7:45 a. m. stopped off the village at East Head 
to communicate with Utoxia, making arrangements with him to purchase deer 
during the winter, which should be called for the following season. At 1:30 p. m. 
on the 10th of August the ship anchored off the reindeer station and the deer were 
duly landed. This closed the trips for the season after reindeer. 
Having arranged affairs at the reindeer station at 4 o’clock on the morning of 
August 11, the anchor was hove and the steamer Bear got under way for Kotzebue
-P-A-G-E-261
  
REPORT ON EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 891 
Sound. By 10 o’clock we were rounding Cape Prince of Wales through the straits. 
Off to the westward 3 large umniaks were seen under sail en route to Siberia. 
The next day at noon we came to anchor off Cape Blossom, Kotzebue Sound. Soon 
after 12 umniak loads of Eskimo came off to the ship. This is the location of 
one of the international and intertribal annual fairs of the Arctic, and the annual 
opportunity for the sick through all Arctic Alaska to secure the services of a physi- 
cian. The natives brought with them a number of the bones and tusks of the mam- 
moth, which were secured for the Sitka Museum. At 10:45 p. m., the surgeon of the 
ship having attended to the ailments of the population that came on board, the 
anchor was hove and the ship steamed for Point Hope, which was reached at 9 p.m., 
August 13, The weather, however, was so foggy that the ship was compelled to go 
far out to sea to avoid the shoals off the point, and therefore we were unable to come 
to anchor until midnight. The following morning, the fog having lifted, the captain 
very kindly sent me ashore to inspect the station and confer with the missionary 
teacher. Returning to the ship at noon, we got under way, sailing to the north. 
Learning from the natives that a whaling schooner, Silver Wave, was wrecked in the 
vicinity of Icey Cape, astop of a few hours was made at that point to secure definite 
information, after which, continuing northward, the refuge station at Point Barrow 
was reached at 11:45 a.m. on the 16th of August. Going ashore to confer with 
regard to school matters, I was detained until the fourth day there on account of a 
storm having come up, making the surf dangerous. Capt. Borden, the ex-keeper of 
the station, having been relieved from duty, Lieut. Jarvis was placed in charge by 
Capt. Healy, pending the turning over of the station to our former teacher, Mr. L, 
M. Stevenson, who had been appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury to take 
charge. On the 18th of August Mr. Stevenson and myself, after canvassing all sec- 
tions of the vicinity, selected a location for the Presbyterian mission on the first rise 
of ground to the north of the village, lying back and between the village and the 
refuge station, and separated from the village by a small ravine. That same even- 
ing 1 was able to return on board ship through the surf. On the 19th the mission 
bell, which had been en route two years, was landed on the beach, and for the first 
time rang out upon the Arctic air. On the 20th of August Capt. Healy took the Bear 
to Point Belcher to bring up some coal which had been left from the previous sea- 
son. On the 11th of June a whaleboat, containing 9 boys and 1 woman, was driven 
out to sea from Point Belcher, and they were unable to return until the 16th of July, 
being thirty-five days out to sea in an open boat. During the time they captured 
11 walrus, 1 white bear, and all the seal that they could eat. 
From the same place two boats’ crew were driven off to sea, but were out only 
nine days. While at Point Belcher the Bear was boarded by Capt. Owen, of the 
whaling bark Mermaid, who brought us news and newspapers from civilization as 
late as June 30. At 4:30 p. m., on the 21st, anchor was weighed and the ship got 
under way to return to the refuge station. The Arctic currents were so strong that 
in the fog the ship was carried some 20 miles beyond its destination, so that we 
did not come to anchor off tho station until 9:45 the next day. All duties having 
been discharged at the refuge station and school, at 4 o’clock on the morning of 
August 23 anchor was hove, and we started on our return to tho south, anchoring 
otf Icy Cape, on the next day, to enable the crew of the Bear to get off from the 
beach the Arctic schooner Silver Wave, which was accomplished on the afternoon of the 
26th. Taking the schooner in tow at 8:15 a. m. of the 27th, the Bear started on its 
return to the reindeer station at Port Clarence. A gale having come up at mid- 
night we anchored off Cape Sabin. The next morning another start was made, but, 
finding the sea too rough for comfortably towing the schooner, the captain ran under 
the lea of Cape Sabin and anchored. At 3 on the morning of the 30th we again got 
under way, reaching Point Hope at noon, where Lieutenant White and a boat’s 
crew were sent ashore with the mail. The boat swamped on the beach. The men, 
however, escaped with nothing more than a drenching. On the morning of the 31st, 
the wind having shifted a little, anchor was weighed and another start was made 
for Cape Prince of Wales. At midnight, meeting the steamer Jane Gray, San Fran- 
cisco papers as late as July 23d were received. On the evening of the Ist of Sep- 
tember the Diomede Islands were sighted. In Bering Straits a strong tide was 
met, so that from 3 a. m. until 9 the ship steamed but 16 miles. From 9:30 until 
5p. m., with a full head of steam, no progress was made against the gale, the ship 
rather drifting back toward the straits, and the course of the ship was changed 
to the south. While opposite Cape Prince of Wales Mr. and Mrs. Thornton ven- 
tured off in a native boat through a heavy surf and a rough sea. From them we 
learned that Mr. W. T. Lopp and Miss Kittredge had been married (the first Chris- 
tian marriage ever celebrated in Alaska north and west of St. Michael) and gone 
down to the reindeer station in a umiak on a wedding tour. 
The gale drove us far south of our course, and when the morning of the 3d dawned 
no one on shipboard knew just where we were. About 6:10 o’clock, the fog lifting 
for an instant, land was sighted toward the northeast, which was afterward found  
-P-A-G-E-262
  892 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. | 
to be Kings Island. Owing to a succession of gales and the difficulty of towing a 
schooner through heavy seas, the ship was detained over a week in reaching Port 
Clarence. However, at 2:40 p. m., September 3d, anchor was dropped opposite the 
reindeer station, the surf being too heavy to admit of landing. The following day 
a landing was effected, and the various supplies that were to be landed at the sta- 
tion were taken on shore. Mr. A. 8. McClellan, who during the summer had been 
erecting the mission residence at Cape Prince of Wales, was received on board for 
transportation to the Aleutian Islands, and at 10:50 p. m. the ship got under way 
for St. Michael, which was reached on the morning of September 6th. Here it was 
found that the steamer P. B. Ware was on the stocks, being built for the Yukon 
River trade, and that the workmen who had been brought up from Puget Sound 
had struck for higher wages and the work was at a standstill; that the company 
who were building the steamer had on the beach in a canvas house $75,000 worth of 
goods and supplies for the miners at the headquarters of the Yukon River, all of 
which was in great danger of being lost. On account of these things and the late- 
ness of the season, the men in charge very naturally sought assistance from the 'rev- 
enue cutter. Recognizing the emergency, Capt. Healy sent to their assistance 
Assistant Engineer Faulkenstein, the carpenter, and 8 men from the crew, and 
each day Lieut. Jarvis was sent from the ship with a boat’s crew to render such 
assistance as they could. Mr. McClellan and Mr. Brower, passengers on the Bear, 
also volunteered assistance. In nine days, through the assistance of the revenue 
cutter, the steamer was so far completed that she was launched. The birthday of 
the Emperor of Russia occurring on the 11th of September, special services were 
held in the Russo-Greek church at St. Michael. Flags were displayed and at noon 
a salute of 4 guns was fired. At 11:30 a. m. on the 15th of September anchor 
was hove and the ship got under way for Unalaska, reaching anchorage in Dutch 
Harbor at 10a. m. on the 19th of September. On the evening of the 30th I was 
kindly received on board the revenue steamer Rush, Capt. W. C. Coulson, command 
ing. At5in the morning of October 1, in the face of a north-northwest gale, with 
snow and hail, we put out tosea for San Francisco. Great difficulty was experienced 
in rounding Priest Rock, for sometime doubt being expressed whether the ship 
could make it. Getting safely around the point in Analga Pass, a heavy tide rip was 
encountered and great seas swept over the ship from stem to stern. On the 8th 
the gale was so increased that it was not considered safe to run and the ship was 
laid to fortwelve hours. Again resuming its course, we dropped anchor in San 
Francisco Bay at 10 o’clock a. m. on the 11th of October. The next day I left by 
the Santa Fe route for Washington, which place I reached at noon on October 18, 
having traveled 16,997 miles. 
Iremain, with great respect, yours, truly,

INTRODUCTION. 
The history of a movement is rarely that of a steady progress. At 
varying intervals of time new forces come into play, new factors are 
introduced, and new epochs are inaugurated. In all history we recog- 
nize these milestones marking off and separating successive periods. 
In the history of educational development in the United States is to 
be discovered the same characteristic. Here, too, are found the mile- 
stones of progress, and one of the most recent of these is that which 
marks the development of summer schools as an element in the educa- 
tional system of the country. 
The importance of the summer school, and the work to be performed 
by it in promoting the increase of knowledge among the people, are 
facts easy of determination. The rapid spread of the summer school 
idea, as indicated by the establishment of new schools, and the increased 
attendance at old schools, proves the existence of a genuine demand 
on the part of the people for just such instruction as these institutions 
are able to afford. The widespread, and, if we may so call it, indige- 
nous character of the demand, is farther to be noted. Summer schools 
in the United States have not been copies of Old World methods, nor 
primarily as following the example of some one successful effort of the 
kind in this country. All over the country, and in almost every State 
of the nation these schools have sprung up spontaneously, as it were, 
. and to supply local demands. 
The work, to the performance of which the vacational school is espe- 
cially adapted, is of three kinds: 
First. There is the task of providing instruction for those persons 
desirous of adding to their intellectual attainments, but otherwise 
unable to obtain professional assistance in their studies. The instruc- 
tion, when it has this object, is generally and of necessity popular in 
character and limited to those branches in which information of a fairly 
satisfactory nature can be obtained without the necessity of prolonged 
and continuous effort, and in which the advantages derived from an 
attendance at the summer session can be easily supplemented by read- 
ing, privately pursued. It is for these reasons-that we find in the 
schools, whose attendance is largely of students of this class, the 
instruction, limited, as a rule, to such subjects as literature, social 
problems, general history, physical training, elocution, kindergarten, 
and the like. The work of the various Chautauqua assemblies is 
almost wholly of this first character, and to a greater or less extent 
this feature is present and controls the work of the other schools. 
Second. The second advantage afforded by summer schools is the 
opportunity given university and college students of adding to their 
regular work either by way of making up deficiencies, or advancing 
further in favorite branches than the press of other work permits in the 
winter time. These sessions likewise afford students preparing for col- 
lege the opportunity of obtaining lacking requirements for matricula- 
tion, and experience has shown that the number of students who do 
thus avail themselves of this privilege is very considerable. 
Third. The third task that a summer institute of learning has dem- 
onstrated its ability to perform is that exemplified in the work of the 
schools of biology. This is work that can not be done at the university 
or college, and from its very character has to be performed at the sea- 
side and in the summer. As will be pointed out in the chapter treat- 
ing of these schools, here is presented to teachers the opportunity of
-P-A-G-E-265
      
HISTORY OF SUMMER SCHOOLS IN 'THE UNITED STATES. 895 
carrying forward private investigation in their own special fields, and 
to students the privilege of obtaining a direct knowledge of laboratory 
work and an insight into the methods of original work. 
Fourth. The fourth advantage derived from the existence of summer 
institutes is to be found in the field of pedagogies. Severai of the 
schools are devoted purely to instruction in the art of teaching, and in 
all of the larger institutions are departments of methods. Probably at 
the head of the schools devoted to work of this kind is the Martha’s 
Vineyard Summer Institute, at which, I am told, that of the 600 in 
attendance at the last session more than 550 were teachers. At these 
summer schools professors in various institutions are able to make the 
personal acquaintance of each other, to exchange views, and to obtain 
opinions upon new methods of instruction. In addition to this, teach- 
ers are enabled to better equip themselves for their work by means of 
their own study and their association with minds more fully and more 
scientifically trained in their especial branches. 
The foregoing description of the proper provinces of work for the 
summer schools has served also to define the advantages derived by 
the people from the establishment of these institutions. But, further 
than these, there are other and peculiar privileges afforded. First of 
all, there is presented the opportunity of personal relationship and 
contact between teachers and pupils. The recognition of and increase 
in the personal element in instruction is a distinct gain. The specifie 
information contained in a lecture or class recitation may be small, but 
if there be created in the minds of the students a greater enthusiasm 
in the search for truth, a stimulus is given to future work, the impor- 
tance of which it is not easy to overestimate. Again, the opportunity 
is given the student of concentrating attention upon a single favorite 
subject. Not only this, but in some of the better and larger schools 
the chance is presented of hearing the latest results of study in a 
particular field of knowledge as given not by a single lecturer, but by 
possibly a dozen of the leading professors, each dealing with his own 
special topic upon which he is an authority. Last, and not to be dis- 
regarded, is the opportunity afforded by summer schools of combining 
profit with pleasure, physical invigoration with mental development. 
With searcely an exception, summer schools in the United States are 
located at pleasure or health resorts, many of them upon the seashore, 
others by the lakeside, and some in the heart of the mountains. At 
these institutions the elective principle receives its complete applica- 
tion. Studies are taken up, and courses of lectures followed, solely 
because the student is interested in those particular subjects. This of 
itself guarantees an attentive audience to the lecturer, and an inter- 
ested class to the instructor. 
Summer schools in nowise compete with or antagonize the college 
or winter school. They occupy fields which the latter cannot possess. 
Indirectly they benefit them. By diffusing and intensifying the desire 
for knowledge, they render more fertile the field from which the ordi- 
nary school and higher institution of learning derive their support. 
The one serious indictment brought against summer schools is the 
superficiality or the “scrappy” nature of the instruction given. Ithink 
the charge is rather exaggerated. As has been already noted, so far 
as concerns schools that provide instruction for persons who are with- 
out scholastic training, and have not the time for prolonged and con- 
tinuous study, the instruction must necessarily be of a popular char- 
acter. Certainly it is neither complete nor profound. Yet, I think it 
scarcely a fair use of words to term this instruction superficial. The
-P-A-G-E-266
  896 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
word superficial has really two distinct meanings. In its purest con- 
notation it means solely the opposite of profound. In common parlance, 
however, there is attached to this meaning a sense of pretense of pro- 
fundity with an actual superficiality—that is to say,a hypocritical 
appearance of thoroughness. Unless limited to the first meaning the 
word is not properly used. Most of these schools recognize their own 
limitations. They appreciate that their instruction must be adapted 
to the shortness of their sessions, and that they must therefore deal 
with the general principles rather than the details of the arts and 
sciences. Yet if the schools properly and fully perform that which they 
assume to perform, the word superficial, with its common invidious 
meaning, is not justly applied. 
The vital question, however, is this: Is not the instruction that is 
given in many cases unnecessarily general and unsystematic and dis- 
connected? Can not this instruction be made more systematic, more 
substantial, and more useful, and yet be adapted to the abilities of the 
people, to the wants of whom these schools minister? There is 
undoubtedly room for improvement, and it would be strange if there 
were not. I think I see, however, the prospect of great betterment 
in the present rapidly spreading doctrines of proper university exten- 
sion methods. Summer schools undoubtedly represent in their work 
the effort at attainment of the same end as that to which the 
“university extension movement” is devoted—namely, the wider 
diffusion of sound useful information among the people at large. The 
comnon method of instruction at these schools has been that of lec- 
tures, sometime in courses, but more often single. Good teachers have 
not been lacking. In the great majority of cases their teaching forces 
are composed of professors drawn from the faculties of the leading 
colleges and universities. As yet, however, theselectures and lecture 
courses have lacked frequently the very essentials that ‘university 
extension” leaders now insist upon. These are, the giving of lecture 
courses of considerable length upon some one subject, rather than the 
use of a large number of single lectures upon detached subjects; the 
use of printed syllabi, giving outlines of the lectures, bibliographies, 
and suggestions for private study; the encouragement of discussions 
at the end of every lecture; and the holding of written examinations 
at the termination of each course, The information obtained thus loses 
much of its “scrappy” nature, and is more complete; the student is 
stimulated in the discussions to independent thought, and encouraged 
to properly directed private reading by the syllabi. 
With the spread of the “university extension” movement must come 
a fuller acceptance and application of its methods by the summer 
schools, which can not but greatly enhance the value of their work. 
For this reason, together with the fact that with the increasing intelli- 
gence of the people comes a growing demand for still greater enlighten- 
ment, one may safely predict for the summer school afuture of expanding 
usefulness, and a growing importance among the educational methods 
of the country. 
A description of the history, organization and work of these summer 
schools finds a legitimate and important place in a treatment of that 
movement, whose aim is the extension of higher education among the 
people. A treatment of this phase of university extension in the 
United States must, however, both from choice and necessity, be 
eclectic in character. The term “university extension” in its special 
connotation, as used in England, and of late in this country, designates a 
definite idea and purpose, and the development of the plans by which
-P-A-G-E-267
  
HISTORY OF SUMMER SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 897 
this idea or purpose is to be effected has been definite and easy of 
description. With regard to the history of summer schools it has been 
otherwise. 
In a general way the motives of the various summer assemblies, 
schools, colleges, and institutes of learning that have been established 
in this country have been the popularization of knowledge and the wider 
diffusion of higher education. But there has been no uniformity of 
organization, method, or scope of instruction. There has been no 
afiiliation among them. Some have been mere summer sessions of col- 
legiate institutions; others, semireligious gatherings; others have 
been private speculative undertakings; others, institutions established 
by learned societies or associations. Very many of these summer 
schools have had but an ephemeral existence, being born, flourishing, 
and dying in the course of a single summer. Others, of larger exis- 
tence, have been migratory in character, changing their location from 
year to year. Some have been but the continuance of an older school 
under a new name, and others the result of the coalescence of two or 
more institutions. None, except the few ‘“ teachers’ assemblies,” have 
had connection with State systems of education, or have made reports 
to superintendents of education. > 
In scope and method of instruction there has been also the greatest 
diversity, ranging from the kindergarten to thelaboratory for scientific 
investigation, and from instruction in a single branch to a curriculum 
containing. a score of subjects. 
For these reasons the task of preparing a corrected and complete 
history or summer schools in the United States is beset with difficul- 
ties. The task of obtaining the requisite information has been an 
especially arduous one. Though great diligence has been employed, 
the author has not been able to obtain in many instances that informa- 
tion which he desired. 
In the following pages summer schools are grouped under special 
heads according to fundamental characters and aims. The larger, 
more important, and typical institutions will receive special considera- 
tion. In regard, however, to the amount of space devoted to each insti- 
tution, it will not be possible to maintain in all cases a proper perspec- 
tive, owing to the fact that in some instances schools deserving of con- 
siderable mention have afforded the author inadequate information. 
The following are the groups into which I shall, for convenience, 
arrange the summer schools in the United States: 
First: Schools for original research and for the training of specialists. 
The schools failing under this head are gatherings of investigators and 
specialists, rather than of students. Of teaching there is little, the 
especial attention being given to scientific investigation. The sole 
representatives of this class are the schools of biology, which embrace 
among their number the first permanent summer school in the United 
States, and with a sketch of the history of which this monograph 
begins. 
Second. Summer schools giving instruction in single subjects. Under 
this head will fall the schools of philosophy, literature, ethics, lan- 
guages, music, etc. 
Third. Summer schools giving instruction in several branches. This 
class, according to my arrangement, includes a large number of instruc- 
tions of a widely varying size and character. Their sessions usually 
last from two to six weeks, and the instruction is, for the most part, 
by lectures. Two of the schools under this head, “The Chautauqua 
      
 
-P-A-G-E-268
  898 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Assembly ” and “The Martha’s Vineyard Institute,” will, on account of 
their size and importance, receive somewhat extended treatment in 
separate chapters. 
Norg.—Prominent among methods adopted by Americans for securing trained teachers and supple- menting the work of normal schools have been the teachers’ institutes. These institutes are gather- ings of public school teachers for the discussion of methods of instruction, and as such meetings are almost universally held in the summer, a treatment of their work would’ naturally seem to form a art of this monograph. ‘The whole subject, however, has been already thoroughly treated and pub- ished as a monograph by this Bureau (Circular of Information, No, 2, 1885), and the description of this subject will therefore not be duplicated here.

I.—SCHOOLS OF BIOLOGY.' 
The summer school can hardly be termed a new factor in our educa- 
tional system. As early as the summer of 1869 a dozen professors and 
students, chiefly from the scientific schools of Harvard University, 
made a trip to Colorado, where scientific results of considerable value 
were achieved. During the next four years parties of students, under 
the charge of Prof. Marsh and other Yale professors, made several 
expeditions to the region of the Rocky Mountains. The geological and 
mineralogical collections then secured were large and valuable, and are 
now deposited in the Museum of Natural History at New Haven. It 
was also the custom of Prof. Orton, of Vassar College, to spend a 
couple of weeks of the summer vacation with his pupils in different 
places of geological interest. 
These were instances of educational instruction, but they can scarcely 
be dignified by the name of schools. The first idea of the establish- 
ment of a permanent summer school can probably be ascribed to Prof. 
N.S. Shaler, who first suggested to his colleague, Louis Agassiz, the 
establishment and maintenance during the summer of a seaside labora- 
tory at. Nantucket for the benefit both of university students and of 
teachers of science in secondary schools. The outcome of this sugges- 
tion was the establishment of the Anderson School on Penikese Island 
ANDERSON SCHOOL ON PENIKESE ISLAND, 
Few events in modern times have had a greater significance, and 
exerted a more profound influence upon the course of educational devel- 
opment in this country than the establishment of the Zoological Labo- 
ratory at Penikese, by Prof. Louis Agassiz. Just as in Europe seaside 
schools and laboratories may be traced to the example set and influence 
exerted by the famous International Marine Laboratory at Naples, so 
in America, most of the marine stations for biological investigation owe 
their origin to influences emanating from Penikese. Outgrowths of this 
latter school, itself of short continuance, are the several biological 
schools existing to-day, and which constitute the sole representatives 
of summer schools whose energies are devoted to research of an original 
character. 
1m the preparation of the following history of schools of biology, I have derived great assistance from a paper kindly sent me by J. C. Campbell, professor of biology in the University of Georgia.

900 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  For a time it seemed as though financial difficulties would prevent 
the accomplishment of the project, but by the generous gifts of Mr. 
John Anderson, of New York, sufficient support was obtained to guar- 
antee the successful establishment of the school. 
This gentleman, attracted by the appeal made by Prof. Agassiz to 
the legislature for State aid, offered as a/ location for the station Peni- 
kese Island, in Buzzards Bay, 25 miles southeast of Newport, R. I. It 
is the most easterly of the three western islands of the Elizabeth group, 
and contains about 100 acres of great fertility. For the purpose for 
which it was now donated it was admirably adapted. A few days later, 
Mr. Anderson, continuing his generosity, met some of the further prac- 
tical difficulties of the organization by an endowment of $50,000 for the 
equipment and running expenses of the school. 
Another friend presented a yacht of 80 tons burden for collecting 
purposes, and further contributions of money were received from other 
sources. A building was erected which offered large accommodations, 
there being fifty-eight lodging rooms on the upper floors. In 1873 this 
laboratory was thrown open and 43 students were attracted from all 
sections of the country, but in December of this year the death of the 
- founder took place. During the following season the school was con- 
ducted by Prof. Alexander Agassiz, with an attendance of 46, but did 
not meet with the financial support that was anticipated, so the whole 
project was given up. 
The establishment of this laboratory was the first consummation of 
a plan long cherished by its founder to provide students of marine 
animal life with a place where they might easily obtain their material, 
and at the same time enjoy the conveniences for study afforded by a- 
well-arranged laboratory. It was the natural outcome of the conditions 
of biology in America at the time of its foundation. The early years 
of the present century were almost entirely taken up with the collec- 
tion, description, and cataloguing of the plants and animals of the 
country, and investigators aimed at little more than this. Naturally 
the most conspicuous forms first attracted attention. Determination of 
names was regarded as the all-important thing, and the adult forms 
alone were usually made the subject of such study. Embryology was 
unknown, and the profound alterations which it has made in biological 
work were then scarcely dreamed of. So long as this was the case the 
establishment of a marine laboratory would not have been possible. 
Collecting grounds and a museum in which to store the objects collected 
were alone needed; a fixed location would have been a disadvantage. 
With the advent of Prof. Agassiz, in 1846, the character of work 
done in America began to change, and in more recent times it has 
undergone a complete metamorphosis. Instead of being as it once was, 
the study of the external forms of animals, it has become a study of 
life itself. It has broadened out to embrace not only the study of ani- 
mals now existing, but their past history; and it also includes as a part 
of its subject-matter many questions once generally regarded as beyond 
the reach of scientific methods. 
In consequence of this, it has come about that new conditions for 
study are necessary New questions that arise demand new methods 
adapted to their solution. Biology has become more experimental than 
formerly. As the chemist constructs his own conditions to simplify the 
solution of the problems which fall within his province, so the biologist 
finds the conditions prevailing in the higher and better known animals 
too complex to be solved exceptin thesame way. ‘But nature has already 
furnished the simple conditions needed, for in the lower invertebrate

animals found in the sea, are represented in an elementary form all of 
the manifestations of life observed in those highest in the scale, while 
at the same time many of the structural peculiarities of higher animals 
are made plain only by comparison with these lower forms. 
It is to the study of marine animals that we must look for the solu- 
tion of many of the problems of biology, and it was perfectly evident to 
Agassiz that the entire life history of any animal must be known before 
there could be any real knowledge of its true relationships, and hence 
arose the necessity that the investigator should be so placed that he 
could collect his own material for study, and observe it under its 
natural conditions throughout its entire life. Visits to the seaside had 
of course been frequently made by investigators, and while these may 
have sufficed for the mere enumeration of supposed new species, they 
did not offer favorable conditions for embryological studies. When 
biology reached such a condition that this constituted the greater por- 
tion of the work to be done, the establishment of marine laboratories 
followed almost as a matter of course. Penikese would not have been 
possible many years earlier and indeed when established was almost 
premature. The magnetism of Prof. Agassiz held it together, and inves- ~ 
tigators came there largely that they might be thrown in contact with 
him. His enthusiasm aroused all those within its reach, but after his 
death appeals were made in vain for the continuance of the laboratory. 
The investigators of the country did not encourage the project, and the 
necessary funds could not be obtained. Prof. Alexander Agassiz even 
contemplated moving the laboratory to Wood’s Holl where it would be 
more accessible and the fauna richer, but even then the sentiment was 
not sufficiently established. Investigators and students generally were 
not sufficiently convinced of its utility and practicability, and it was 
therefore temporarily abandoned. 
Such were the circumstances under which were established the first 
marine laboratory and summer school in this country. Summer ses- 
sions were a necessity, both because many of those in attendance were 
teachers and unable to be present at other times and also because the 
advantages for collecting were greater at this season than at any other, 
and the needs of the investigator were mainly regarded. Since that 
time the movement has spread to include other departments of knowl- 
edge, and to furnish instruction of a more elementary character to those 
who could not be reached in any other way. Thesummer-school move- — 
ment was warmly seconded at Harvard by Dr. Asa Gray. To meet the 
same conditions and accommodate the same class of students, he estab- 
lished a summer school in botany, in 1874, which continues to serve a 
useful purpose up to the present time. 
SUCCESSORS TO THE PENIKESE SCHOOL, 
The most direct successor of the Penikese laboratory was the private 
laboratory established by Prof. Alexander Agassiz at Newport, in 1877. 
This is noted for the elegance of its equipment, and for its many conven- 
iences for work, but it can scarcely be classed among the summer 
schools of the country for the reason that it is private property, and 
open only to a limited number of workers upon special terms. 
In 1876 a summer school of biology was opened at Salem, Mass., by 
the Peabody Academy of Sciences. It was under the direction of 
Profs. Packard and Kingsley, and was intended for beginners, as well 
as for advanced students. In 1881 it was discontinued.

THE CHESAPEAKE ZOOLOGICAL LABORATORY OF THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.) 
The first real revival of the Penikese idea was in 1878, when the 
trustees of the Johns Hopkins University made an appropriation to 
establish the Chesapeake Zoological Laboratory. Their idea in so 
doing was to make provision only for students sufficiently advanced to 
undertake original research. No building was erected, and indeed no 
permanent location was chosen, but the laboratory was moved from 
place to place as seemed desirable, thé appropriation being sufficient 
to furnish all needed conveniences for work. 
This laboratory was established as a branch of the biological depart- 
ment of the university, as an experimental seaside station for the study 
of the marine zoology of the Chesapeake Bay. The enterprise was 
conceived, organized, and conducted by Dr. W. K. Brooks, who has 
been connected with the university since it first opened in 1876, as 
associate in the biological department, of which Dr. H. N. Martin has 
been head. 
The Seeretary of War, at the instance of fhe late Prof. Henry and of 
Prof. Baird, granted the use of the incompleted Fort Wool, at the 
mouth of Hampten Roads. The fort is on an artificial island 6 acres 
in extent, made by dropping granite blocks into the water; it is 3 
miles from one shore, half as far from the other, and 20 miles from the 
ocean. A strong current runs close to the walls of the fort, and thus 
earries 15 or 20 miles of water past its walls at each turn of the tide, so 
that free swimming animals and embryos were obtainable in endless 
variety without leaving the fort. Ten workers were at one time or 
another during the summer in attendance. A majority of them were 
connected with the university, the rest were school teachers. No lee- 
ture courses were given, but the work was so conducted as to accom- 
plish four objects, viz,to furnish advanced students with opportunities 
for original investigation; to provide material for winter work in the 
university; to enable less advanced students to become acquainted 
with forms of life, which can only be studied at the seaside, and to give 
them an opportunity to become practically acquainted with the methods 
of marine zoology; and to increase scientific knowledge regarding the 
zoology of Chesapeake Bay. Though the laboratory was occupied only 
eight weeks during the first session, very considerable scientific results 
were reached, as is shown in the following list of published papers: 
Land Plants found at Fort Wool, N.B. Webster; List of Animals 
found at Fort Wool, P. R. Uhler; Development of Lingula, W. K. Brooks; 
Early Stages of Amphioxus, H..J. Rice; Lucifer Typhus, W. Saxon; 
Development of Gasteropods, W. K. Brooks; Development of Squilla, 
W. K. Brooks. 
During the session of 1879, Dr. Brooks had with him at the Chesa- 
peake laboratory eleven workers, several, as before, being from the 
university. The chief work of the session was the investigation into 
the development and habits of the oyster. The United States and 
Maryland fish commissions cooperated with the university toward 
the laboratory and dredging outfit. Seven weeks were spent at Cris- 
field, the center of the oyster trade of the eastern shore of Maryland, 
and four weeks were passed at Fort Wool. The paper embodying the 
results of the investigation into the nature and development of the oys-

ter, with ten plates, may be found in the Report of the Commissioners 
of Fisheries for Maryland. 
The sessions of 1880, 1881, and 1882 were spent at Beaufort, N. C., 
the situation >f this town being especially favorable for zoological work, 
the surrounding waters presenting such a diversity of conditions that 
the fauna are unusually rich and varied. 
In addition to the work of the Chesapeake Zoological Laboratory at 
Beaufort, a class of beginners was conducted during the summer of 
1881 at Fort Wool, Va., by Dr. 8. F, Clarke, of the biological depart- 
ment of theJohns Hopkins University. Instruction was given by means 
of lectures and also by daily collecting and observing the various ani- 
mals in their native haunts. The lectures, twenty-seven in number, 
extended through the session. Hight students were in attendance. 
The sixth year was spent at Hampton, Va. The appointment of Dr. 
W. K. Brooks by the governor of Maryland as commissioner to exam- 
ine the condition of the oyster beds caused this removal, as he was 
compelled to spend much of the season in the Chesapeake Bay. 
The seventh and eighth sessions of the laboratory were held at Beau- 
fort. 
In the summer of 1886 the laboratory was stationed in the coral island 
Abaco, the Bahamas, W. IL. with a secondary station at Beaufort. 
The session of 1887 was held at Nassau,on the island New Providence, 
and during the following season on one of the Florida Keys. Financial 
reasons caused the laboratory to be discontinued during the next 
few years, but in the summer of 1891 asession was again held at Port 
Henderson in Jamaica, lasting fourteen weeks. 
During the entire ten years of the existence of this laboratory it 
has been under the direction of Dr. W. K. Brooks. The sessions here 
lasted usually about two months, and the amount of work done has 
been very considerable. The published results of the work done at 
the seaside during these years number over one hundred titles. Thirty- 
four of these are books or illustrated papers; sixteen of them were origi- 
nally published in England or Germany; and translations of forty-six of 
them have appeared in the zoological journals of England, Germany, and 
France. The fact that many of these results thus obtained have been 
incorporated into standard text-books attests the value of the work 
accomplished. The laboratory enjoys the distinction of having been 
the first marine laboratory successfully carried on in this country in 
which research of purely scientific value was made the ruling feature. 
This laboratory was established primarily for the benefit of students 
already in attendance at the Johns Hopkins University and conducted 
in connection with the courses there given. No effort has been made 
to bring it into prominence as a separate organization. 
ANNISQUAM AND WOOD’S HOLL LABORATORIES. 
In the Annual Report of the Boston Society of Natural History for 
1881 it is stated that “it has been considered desirable to found a 
summer laboratory sufficient to supply the needs of a class of persons 
who have begun to work practically under our direction, but have 
hitherto had no convenient means for pursuing their studies on the sea 
shore. * * * Weare sure that such a laboratory is needed for a 
limited number of persons * * * about a dozen in all, but we are 
not sure of any real demand outside of these.” 
In 1881 a circular was issued announcing the opening of a marine 
laboratory at Annisquam, Mass. This was supported by the Woman’s  
-P-A-G-E-274
904 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  Educational Association of Boston, together with the Boston Society 
of Natural History, and was designed “to afford opportunities for the 
study and observation of the development, anatomy, and habits of com- 
mon types of marine animals under suitable direction and advice.” In 
oue respect this laboratory differed from both the Penikese and Chesa- 
peake laboratories, viz, that students were received who were virtually 
beginners. Twenty-two of this class were present the first year, and 
although the number fluctuated in different years there were 26 present 
in 1886 when the laboratory ceased to exist. It had always been the 
policy of both the associations which shared the management of the 
Annisquain laboratory to give up any of their departments as soon as 
they were upon a firm basis, and any other institutions would accept and 
carry them on. 
Both the society and the association have therefore felt, after six years of successful 
working, that the Annisquam laboratory had reached a stage of advancement when 
it could claim and perhaps receive sufficient aid from the patrons of science and 
learning to be placed upon an independent and permanent foundation. * * 
The Woman’s Educational Association called a meeting, composed largely of rep- 
resentative teachers of biology, and the fate of thelaboratory was surrendered to 
their deliberations. They decided that an effort should be made to establish a marine 
biological laboratory, and at least $15,000 should be raised to carry it on for five 
years, ! 
This effort was so far successful that in March, 1888, the Marine Bio- 
logical Laboratory was chartered and the work of erecting a building 
at Wood’s Holl, Mass., at once begun. Dr. C. O. Whitman was 
appointed director of the laboratory, with B. H. Van Vleck as instructor. 
Provision was made for investigators and students, and on July 
17 the laboratory opened with 7 of the former and 8 of the latter class 
in attendance. During the first session the following subjects, among 
others, were studied in the department of investigation: The develop- 
ment of the lateral line system in the toadfish; the origin and history 
of Kupffer’s vesicle in teleostean embryo; the structure of the sense 
organs in the pectoral fins of Trigola; the anatomy and embryology 
of Ascidians; the fecundation of the eggs of the sea-urchin. 
The work in each case was of a preparatory nature, and designed to 
be carried forward at the next session. Attention was given almost 
exclusively to laboratory work, and only a few informal lectures on 
embryological subjects were given by the director. Prof. W.T. Sedg- 
wick, on the invitation of the director, gave two public lectures upon 
insectivorous plants (especially the Droseras). 
The work of instruction conducted by Prof. B. H. Van Vleck was 
confined chiefly to the study of the structure and life-history of inver- 
- tebrate forms, such as the sponges, hydroids, ctenophores, worms, 
starfishes, sea-urchins, lobsters, crabs, ete. Mounted preparations 
added much to the value of the instruction. Considerable attention 
was given to the histological technique, and a large amount of valua- 
ble material for use in teaching was collected by each member of the 
class.” 
As to the aim and purpose of this new instruction the director, in 
his opening address, said: 
While this institution traces its historic roots to Penikese, and acknowledges, 
with pride, its community of descent with numerous summer schools of natural 
history, it has one feature that distinguishes it from all its predecessors, and on the 
development of this hangs every pledge of the future. In every attempt hitherto 
made to combine the two chief interests here pepresen ey instruction has been the

object of first concern. Now, the only way.to keep the distributive function 
efficient and active is to unite it in proper relations with the productive function. 
The laboratory is the creative agent—the svurce of all supplies; the school is merely 
the receiver and distributor. Any attempt to combine the two which ignores or 
reverses these relations must end in disappointment and failure. The plan pursued 
must be one that will meet the approval, arouse the interest, and compel the coopera- 
tion and active support of the more progressive school of biologists. Our most 
distinguished zoologist declares, in a letter just received, I have no sympathy with 
anything merelu devoted to elementary instruction, and unless the greater part of the 
energy is given to original work, it is of no interest to me.' 
The report of the director for the second session (1889) showed a 
prosperous state of affairs. The number of investigators, teachers, and. 
students in attendance during the session, as compared with the first 
session, showed an increase to nearly the full capacity of all the labor- 
atories. 
The following prospectus issued for the session of 1891 will show the 
present status of this work. 
The corps of instructors for the fourth season (1891) consists of Dr. C. O. Whitman, 
director, professor of zoology at Clark University, and editor of the Journal of Mor- 
phology; E.C. Gardiner, Ph. D., instructor in zoology, Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology; J. Playfair MeMurrich, Ph. D., docent in zoology at Clark University; 
T. H. Morgan, Ph. D., Bruce fellow, Johns Hopkins University ; W. M. Wheeler, fellow 
in biology, Clark University; H.C. Bumpus, assistant professor of zoology, Brown 
University; W.M. Rankin, Ph. D., instructor in zoology, Princeton College; Ryoiche 
Takano, artist; G.M. Gray, laboratory assistant; J.J. Veeder, collector. 
In addition to the regular courses of instruction in zoology, botany, and micro- 
scopical technique, consisting of lectures and laboratory work under the direct and 
constant supervision of the instructors, there will be two or more courses of lectures 
on special subjects by members of the staff. One such course of six lectures will be 
given by Dr. McMurrich on the Clenophora and the Turbeliaria. Similar courses on 
the Mollusca, Crustacea, and Echinodermata will be.given by Prof. Bumpus and 
Dr. Rankin. 
There will also be ten or more evening lectures on biological subjects of general 
interest. Among those who may contribute these lectures and take part in the dis- 
cussions upon them may be mentioned, in addition to the instructors above-named, 
the following: Dr. H. Ayers, of the Lake Laboratory; Prof. B. H. Donaldson, Clark 
University ; Prof. W. G. Farlow, Harvard University; Prof. J. 8. Kingsley, University 
of Nebraska; Prof. W. Libbey, jr., Princeton College; Prof. C. 8. Minot, Harvard Medi- 
cal School; Prof. H. F. Osborn, Princeton College; Dr. 8, Watase, Clark University; 
Prof. E. B. Wilson, Bryn Mawr College. 
The laboratory is located on the coast at Wood’s Holl, Mass., near the laboratories 
of the United States Fish Commission. The building consists of two stories—the 
lower for the use of students receiving instruction, the upper exclusively for inves- 
tigators. The laboratory has aquaria supplied with running sea water, boats, a 
steam launch, collecting apparatus, and dredges; it is also supplied with reagents, 
glassware, and a limited number of microtomes and microscopes. The library is 
provided, not only with the ordinary text-books and works of reference, but also 
with the more important journals of zoology and botany, some of them in complete 
series. 
The laboratory for investigators will be open from June 1 to August 29. It will 
be fully equipped with aquaria, glassware, reagents, ete., but microscopes and 
microtomes will not be provided. In this denartment there are fourteen private 
laboratoriessupplied with aquaria, running water, etc., for the exclusive use of inves- 
tigators, who are invited to carry on their researches here free of charge. Those 
who are prepared to begin original work, but require supervision, special sugges- 
tions, criticism, or extended instruction in technique, may occupy tables in the gen- 
eral laboratory for investigators, paying for the privilege a fee of $50. Thenumber 
of such tables is limited to ten. Applicants for them must state precisely what 
they have done in preparation for original work, and whether they can bring a com- 
plete outfit, viz., microscope, microtome, camera-lucida, etc. 
For the completion of any considerable piece of investigation, beginners usually 
require from one to three full years. It is not expected, therefore, that the holders 
of these tables will finish their work in a single season. The aim is rather to make 
a safe beginning, which will lead to good results if followed up between sessions, 
and renewed, if need be, for several successive years. No applications for less than 
the whole session can-be received in this department.

  906 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
The laboratory for teachers and students will be opened on Wednesday, July 8, 
for regular courses of seven weeks in zoology, botany, and microscopical technique. 
The number admitted to this department will be limited to 30, and preference will 
be given to teachers and others already qualified. By permission of the director 
students may begin their individual work as early as June 15 without extra charge, 
but the regular courses of instruction will not begin before July 8. 
More advanced students who may wish to limit their work to special groups will 
have an opportunity to do so. The regular course in zoloogy, under charge of Prof. 
Bumpus, will embrace a study of the more typical marine forms and elementary 
methods of microscopical technique. The laboratory work will be accompanied by 
lectures. The following is an outline of the course proposed: July 8-13, study of the 
lobster; July 13-20, (a) study of annelids (Nereis, Serpula, Spirobis, ete.), (b) Balano- 
glossus and Phascolosoma, (¢) Polyzoa, (d) Turbellaria; July 20-27, study of the 
celenterates; July 27-August 3, study of the mollusks (Mya, Ostrea, Sycotypus, 
Loligo); August 3-10, echinoderms (starfish, sea-urchin, holothurian, etc.); August 
10-17, crustaceans (Branchipus, Cyclops, Lernwa, Lepas, Idotea, Orchestia, Cancer); 
August 17-26, vertebrates (Amphioxus, elasmobranch, teleost). 
Arrangements for instruction in botany have not yet been completed, but it is 
hoped that Mr. Setchell will again be able to take charge of the work in this depart- 
ment. 
Applicants must state whether they can supply themselves with microscopes and 
microtomes. Microscope slides, dissecting and drawing instruments, bottles, and 
otlier supplies, to be finally taken from the laboratory, are sold at cost. The tuition 
fee is $25, payable in advance. 
A department of laboratory supply has been established in order to facilitate the 
work of teachers and others who desire to obtain materials for study or for classes. 
It is proposed to furnish, e. g., certain sponges, hydroids, starfishes, sea-urchins, 
marine worms, crustaceans, mollusks, and vertebrates, in good condition at fair 
rices, 
Wood’s Holl, owing to the richness of the marine life in the neighboring waters, 
offers exceptional advantages. It is situated on the north shore of Vineyard Sound, 
atthe entrance to Buzzards Bay, and may be reached by the Old Colony Railroad 
(two hours and a half from Boston) or by rail and boat from Providence, Fall 
River, or New Bedford. 
No better proof of the usefulness of the laboratory can be given 
than the fact that in 1890 there were present 20 investigators and 27 
students. These came from all sections of the country and the labor- 
atory may truly be regarded as a national enterprise. It has been so 
conducted as to secure a general interest in its success on -the part of 
the colleges of the country. The fact that instruction goes hand in 
hand with investigation, and that the most perfect cooperation among 
investigators is secured by means of lecture courses in which all take 
part, gives reason for the hope that the great productiveness which has 
thus far characterized the laboratory will be far eclipsed in the future, 
and that to the laboratory there will be generally conceded a distin- 
guished place among the educational institutions of the country. 
THE BROOKLYN IN 
  E BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY. 
The most recent additiun to the number of seaside laboratories for 
the investigation of marine life is that opened in 1890, and conducted 
under the auspices of the Brooklyn Institute. The location of this sta- 
tion is at the head of Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, a favorable 
situation for biological study. 
The country around affords excellent hunting ground for every form 
of animal and vegetable life common to the climate. Just above the 
laboratory is a series of three fresh-water ponds, each fertile in its own 
peculiar forms of fresh-water life, and through which flows the water 
of Cold Spring Creek. Just below the laboratory is the harbor of Cold 
Spring, divided by a sandy neck into an inner and an outer basin. The 
inner basin is particularly rich in marine life, and the channel between 
the inner and outer basins has a varied and vigorous growth of algi, 
mollusks, and echinoderms. The outer basin has rocky projections, 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
  HISTORY OF SUMMER SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 907 
shallow flats, banks, and eel grass, sheltered pools, oyster beds, and 
other conditions favorable for collection and study. The outer basin 
opens into Long Island Sound, whose coast is varied in character for 
20 miles in either direction. 
The main laboratory oceupies the first floor of the New York State 
Fish Commission building, and is a room 36 feet wide and 65 feet long, 
provided with ample light from every side. It is furnished with labora- 
tory tables, aquaria, hatching-troughs, glassware, and all the apparatus 
and appliances required for general biological work. Into the labora- 
tory is conveyed a bountiful supply of the water of the Cold Springs 
for use in the aquaria and troughs. This water is as pure as a crystal, 
has the same low temperature throughout the year, and is the water 
used so successfully by the New York State Fish Commission in hatch- 
ing and growing salmon, trout, and other food fishes. The laboratory 
is also supplied with an abundance of salt water, which is pumped tp 
from the harbor into a brick reservoir, from which it runs to the labora- 
tory. 
The station is provided with three small row boats and a naphtha 
launch, together with nets, trawls, and dredges, for use in collecting 
and dredging. Near the main laboratory is a photographic room, with 
a dark room and work room adjoining. Each student is provided with 
dissecting instruments, chemicals, and glassware, to be used in the dis- 
section, preparation, and study of tissues. Microscopes are provided 
for those students who can not provide themselves with instruments. 
The following general course was open during the session of 1891 to 
each student, and was under the direction of Prof. Conn. It consisted 
primarily of laboratory study of specimens illustrating the types of 
animal life. The practical work was accompanied by lectures giving 
an outline of systematic zoology, for the purpose of showing the rela- 
tions of the forms studied to other animals. The lectures also touched 
upon various matters of general biological interest. The types studied 
in course were as follows: Protozoa, study of microscopie forms, inelud- 
ing directions in the use of the microscope; (1) Celenterata, hydroids, 
ineluding the study of jelly fishes and the development of hydroids; 
(2) Echinodermata, the star-fish; (3) Bryozoa, study of an adult Bryo- 
zoan; (4) Mollusea, the clam,.the snail, development of the oyster or 
some other type; (5) Crustacea, the crab, with a study of its develop- 
ment; (6) Insecta, the grasshopper; (7) Vertebrata, dissection of the 
fish, dissection of the frog. 
Accompanying this course of laboratory-work and lectures was given 
instruction in methods of mounting objects and in the preparation of 
microscopic sections. Opportunity was also given for collecting and 
surface skimming. 
A special feature of the laboratory this season was an extended course 
in the methods of bacteriological research. The course consisted of 
Jaboratory work on the culture and propagation of bacteria, identifica- 
tion of species, and of lectures and demonstrations by the director. 
Only those who were well prepared by previous study and experience 
in biological or medical work were admitted to the course. 
Students who pursue the general course of instruction during the 
summer, and who have time for extra work, are given the instruction 
and facilities necessary to enable them to carry on special investiga- 
tions, while those students who have already gained the knowledge and 
experience which is provided by the general course are permitted to 
give their entire time to special work. 
The laboratory was opened for the season on Tuesday, July 7. The  
-P-A-G-E-278

regular session for students was continued from that date until Friday, 
August 28. 
A good referénce library is placed at the service of students, and a 
collection of alge serves to guide students in marine botany. In addi- 
tion to the regular lectures given in connection with the laboratory 
work, evening lectures occur two or three times a week, illustrated by 
the aid of a magic lantern. The lantern is provided with a vertical 
attachment and with large and small cells, in which forms of life may 
be placed and their structure exhibited on the screen. A microscopic 
attachment to the lantern enables lecturers to demonstrate points in 
minute anatomy, and a large collection of lantern slides of biological 
subjects furnishes the means for comparison of many allied forms and 
structures. The evening lectures are open to the public. 
For the summer sessions of 1892 lectures are announced to be deliv- 
ered by Profs. H.W. Conn, A. 8. Packard, William C, Peckham, Henry 
T. Osborn, Bashford Dead, John B. Smith, B. D. Halstead, T. W. 
Hooper, Thomas Morong, A. M. Kirsch, Charles W. Hargett, H. L. 
Osborn, and Julius Nelson. It is expected, also, that other specialists 
will visit the laboratory during the summer and deliver lectures. 
IMPORTANCE OF THE SUMMER SCHOOLS OF BIOLOGY. 
The work that has been performed by these biological schools has 
been of a very valuable order, and the comparative prosperous condi- 
tion of the institutions of this class now existing indicate a fruitful 
future. The methods of instruction followed have been of the most 
advanced character, and illustrate in its purest form the inductive 
laboratory method in education. In many instances the researches 
carried on or commenced at these stations have led to discoveries of 
great importance to the whole scientific world and to commerce as 
well. An instance of this is to be seen in the work of Prof. W. K. 
Brooks upon the oyster and its cultivation.. At these several seaside 
stations teachers in various institutions have been afforded the oppor- 
tunity of making the personal acquaintance of each other, of exchang- 
ing views, acquiring new methods, and generally deriving encourage- 
ment and stimulation in their work. Younger students have likewise 
been able to obtain a personal help from the different professors, and 
to obtain an insight into proper methods of original research, not to be 
obtained at the university or college. 
Perhaps it would not be too much to say that to the influence exerted 
by these summer schools of biology is due, more than to any other 
one cause, the rapid progress that recent years has witnessed in the 
teaching of biology in the United States.

SumMMER ScHOoLS Giviné INSTRUCTION IN SINGLE SUBJECTS. 
I.—SCHOOLS OF PHILOSOPHY, LITERATURE, AND ETHICS. 
I have made my second group of summer schools include those giving 
instruction in single branches of knowledge. Principal among the 
schools embraced under this head are those where instruction has been 
limited to the so-called “culture sciences,” to philosophy, literature, 
and ethics. As in our treatment of the schools of biology, we were 
able to trace the establishment of them all, more or less directly, to the 
influence exerted by the. Penikese school, so in our description of the 
schools falling within the scope of this chapter we shall find, in a 
degree, the same general influence exerted by the first established 
school of their class—the Concord Summer School of Philosophy. 
THE CONCORD SUMMER SCHOOL OF PHILOSOPHY AND LITERATURE, 
The Concord Summer School of Philosophy and Literature occupies 
a unique and important place in the history of educational experi- 
ments of the United States. The aim of this school, which for ten 
successive summers met at Concord, its first session being in 1879, was 
“to bring together a few of those persons who, in America, have pur- 
sued or desire to pursue the paths of speculative philosophy, to encour- 
age these students and professors to communicate with each other 
what they have learned and meditated, and to illustrate, by a constant 
reference to poetry and the higher literature, those ideas which philos- 
ophy presents. The first purpose of the school was conversation on 
serious topics, the lectures serving merely as a text for discussion, 
while dispute and polemical debate were avoided. It sought in the 
discussions at Concord, not an absolute unity of opinion, but a general 
agreement in the manner of viewing philosophic truth, and applying it 
to the problems of life.” No lecturer was supposed to conform his 
ideas to what was said by others, and there was no ‘Concord school” 
of philosophy, except that the lecturers generally agreed in an utter 
repudiation of materialism, and in maintaining the existence of a per- 
sonal, self-conscious, spiritual cause above the material universe.’ 
The genesis of a school of this character can be traced back to an 
idea conceived by Amos Bronson Alcott in 1842, but the materialization 
of this hope did not come until many years later. In 1878, the visit of 
Dr. Jones, of Illinois, and the conversation with him, suggested to Mr. 
Alcott that the time had at last come for realizing his long-felt desire 
for a conversational school of philosophy and literature to be estab- 
lished in his own town. Accordingly, in the spring of 1879, under the 
advice and with the cooperation of Ralph Waldo Emersom, the late 
Prof. Pierce, of Harvard University, Mrs. Cheney, Dr. W. T. Harris, - 
and other friends of Mr. Alcott, the public were invited to the first 
session of the school, which was opened in Mr. Alcott’s study, at the 
“Orchard House,” now the residence of Dr. Harris. Later sessions were 
held in the “Hillside House,” a building erected for this purpose a few 
steps from the “Orchard House.” The officers of the school were: Mr.

A. B. Alcott, dean; Mr. S. H. Emery, jr., director; and Mr. F. B. San- 
born, secretary. These three, with Dr. Harris and Dr. H. K. Jones, 
constituted the faculty. 
The attendance much exceeded the expectation .of the faculty, 
although the season was much longex than was afterwards found expe- 
dient, the term being six weeks. The chief lecturers were five in num- 
ber, occupying the five week days before Saturday, which was given 
up to single lectures on general topics. During the next three years 
the sessions were five weeks; in 1882 and 1883, four weeks; and after 
that two weeks only. The whole number present at the first session 
was nearly 400, of whom about one-fourth were residents of Concord. 
The last session of the school was held in the summer of 1887. The 
best idea of the work done by this school, its character, the variety of 
subjects considered, and the eminent men who there elaborated their 
philosophies, can be gained from the following abridged programme of 
the courses and lectures for the several years.

BIGHTH YEAR'S PROGRAMME, 2886. 
I. Dante and His Divine Comedy; 12 lectures and conversations. 
II. Plato’s Philosophy; 12 lectures by various speakers. 
NINTH YEAR'S PROGRAMME, 1887, 
The subject of the lectures in 1887 was ‘Aristotle and His Philosophy in its Rela- 
tion to Modern Thought.” There were three courses—two general and one special. 
The first, given in the mornings of the session, dealt with Aristotle’s philosophic 
system as a whole, and endeavored to give a complete account of it, its origin and 
influence, and to determine as far as possible the points of identity and difference 
between it and the thought of recent times, since Bacon, Descartes, and Locke. 
The other general course treated of Aristotle’s art doctrines, and particularly of his 
dramatic theory, comparing it with modern theories. The special course, or ‘‘sym- 
posium” was devoted to ontology, how far such a science is possible, and its effect 
upon: science, ethics, art, and religion. At this session, in addition to the 12 
morning and 10 evening lectures on Aristotle and the papers on ontology, there 
were discussed by the advanced students 26 general topics on the influence of 
Aristotle’s writings, his «esthetics, and his theory of cognition and ontology. 
The sessions lasted during the month of July, 1887. 
TENTH YEAR’S PROGRAMME, 1888. 
This session, the last of the Concord School, lasted but one day, and was devoted 
to an Alcott memorial service. The exercises consisted of a biographical address by 
F. B. Sanborn; a lecture upon ‘The philosophy of Mr. Aleott,” by W. T. Harris, and 
remarks and reminiscences by various speakers. 
In some respects the Concord Summer School of Philosophy stands 
for the highest development of the extra-university method of instrue- 
tion. At Concord were gathered the leading thinkers in speculative 
philosophy, and through their lectures and the attendant discussions 
were opened up and traced the paths along which modern philosophic 
thought was tending. Old-World systems of thought, both new and 
old, were considered and interpreted in the light of the nineteenth

century’s learning. The following quoted paragraph shows the impor- 
tant task to the performance of which this school applied itself: 
Exactly what we are about, what is the value of our civilization, and toward 
what ideals we are working, are things not so clear as they might he, and there is 
great need of keener analysis and more careful thinkers to prevent our drifting 
blindly—to prevent, that is, not by obstructive conservatism, but by progressive 
comprehension. To educate for this purpose, then, is another object of the school. 
In order to know what to teach and what to receive we must seek through philosophy 
the one central principle on which the world—the universe—rests. ‘Then we have to 
trace this back again from that, through all its manifestations in religion, govern- 
ments, literature, art, science, and manners. This is manifestly a large job, and the 
Concord School does not expect to carry it out so that it will never have to be done 
again, but rather to set people in the right path, so that they can keep on doing it 
forever. At atime when Germany is overpowered by the influence of Mill, Spencer, 
and Darwin, and the genius of materialism is getting so strong a hold everywhere, 
it is interesting to find that the Concord School reasserts with breadth and penetra- 
tion thesupremacy ofthemind. * * * Butitmustnot be supposed that the school 
is hostile to science; on the contrary, it approves and heartily sympathizes with it 
in its great work, which, properly regarded, it considers tributary to the highest 
ends of existence.! 
Several of the lectures read at the Concord School have been pub- 
lished. In 1882 was issued a volume entitled Concord Lectures on 
Philosophy,” comprising outlines of all the lectures during the session 
of 1882. In 1884 was published by the school a volume containing all 
- essays and poems read in the special course of 1884 on “The Genius 
and Character of Emerson.”*® The lectures upon Goethe have also been 
published under the title of ‘‘The Life and Genius of Goethe.”*~ Mr. 
John Fiske’s lectures on “The Destiny of Man,” and on “The Idea of 
God,” have also been printed as separate volumes by Houghton, Mifflin 
& Co. <A large number of the single lectures have also appeared in 
reviews and other periodicals 
For several years now this school has been closed. Its sessions were 
discontinued, not because of lack of success, for its promoters con- 
sidered that their efforts had been rewarded to a greater extent than 
they had anticipated. It was believed that the task for which the 
school had been established had been performed. The foremost thinkers 
of the time and of the country had been gathered together, had 
mutually stimulated each other by lecture, discussion, and conversa- 
tion, and the present position of philosophic thought had been clearly 
enunciated. The day may come when we will recognize that by these 
discussions the thought of the time was appreciably influenced and 
that through these teachings a service was performed in stemming, or 
at least giving a higher and proper interpretation to, the materialistic 
tendencies of the age. 
The influence exerted by the Concord School resulted in the estab- 
lishment of several other educational experiments following somewhat 
the same methods, and occupying to an extent the same field. 
THE GLENMORE SCHOOL FOR THE CULTURE SCIENCES. 
After ‘the closing of the summer school at Concord, the idea was 
taken up by Mr. Thomas Davidson, the exponent and translator of the 
Italian philosopher, Antonio Rosmini, and for a few years there was 
conducted by him at Farmington, in Connecticut, a meeting similar to

  to the little town of Glenmore, situated in the very heart of the Adi- 
rondacks. The culture sciences, to which the school is devoted, have 
for their subject (the programme explains) ‘man’s spiritual nature, his 
intelligence, his affections, his will, and the modes in which these 
express themselves. Culture includes a history, a theory, and a prac- 
tice, a certain familiarity with which must be acquired by every person 
who seriously desires to know his relations to the world, and to per- 
form his part worthily therein. The aim of the school, therefore, is 
twofold—(1) scientific, (2) practical. The former it seeks to reach by 
means of lectures on the history and theory of the culture sciences, 
and by classes, conversations, and carefully directed private study. 
The latter it endeavors to realize by encouraging its members to con- 
duct their life in accordance with the highest ascertained ethical laws, 
to strive after ‘plain living and high thinking,’ to discipline themselves 
in simplicity, kindliness, thoughtfulness, helpfulness, regularity, and 
promptness.” 
The following programme of the work of the session of 1892 illus- 
trates the character and scope of the instruction given at this school:

  CHICAGO KINDERGARTEN COLLEGE LITERARY SCHOOL, 
Since 1889 there has been conducted, each year, under the auspices 
of the Chicago Kindergarten College, a session of a literary school. At 
each of these sessions, held either at Easter or Christmas holiday sea- 
son, there have been courses of lectures on some one great man of let- 
ters. The prime mover in this school has been Mr. Denton J. Snider, 
the author of A Commentary on the Shakespearean Drama, A Com- 
mentary on Goethe’s Faust, Commentary on Homer, and A Walk 
Through Hellas. The session of 1892, held at Easter time, was devoted 
to Dante. Ten lectures were given by Mr. Snider, Prof. Thomas Da- 
vidson, Dr. David Swing, Rey. Martin R. Vincent, and others. 
The method of the literary instruction given at these several sessions 
has been the same as that followed by Mr. Snider in his numerous 
works. The masterpieces of literature have been studied, each as an 
organic whole. Their structure and motives have been examined, the 
constituent parts separated and described, and the bearing of each 
part upon the’ other explained. Thus, there has been. delineated at 
once the organic unity of the author’s production and the manner in 
which each member and organ has been made to play its proper part 
in contributing to the symmetry and purpose of the whole. 
MILWAUKEE LITERARY SCHOOL. 
Imitative, also, of the methods followed at Concord, was a course of 
lectures on “ The poetry and philosophy of Goethe,” given before the 
Milwaukee Literary School in August, 1886, These lectures and the 
extempore discussions evoked by them were phonographically reported 
and have been published in bound form.' The lectures, among others, 
included the following: ‘‘Goethe’s Wilhelm Meister as the gospel of 
culture,” by Commissioner W. T. Harris; ‘Goethe as a scientist,” by 
James MacAlister; ‘“Goethe’s relation to English literature,” by 
Mr. F. B. Sanborn; “‘The Divine Comedy and Faust,” by Mrs. ©. K. 
Sherman; “The mythology of the second part of Faust, iby Profs): 
J. Snider: “The elective ‘atfinities,” by Mrs. M. A. Shorey: and “What 
is most valuable to us in German philosophy and literature,” by W. T. 
Harris. 
‘That which impressed the writer most, when reading the report 
of this course of lectures, even more than the value of the lectures 
themselves, was the value of the discussions that were evoked. This

value clearly indicates the wisdom of the leaders of ‘ University 
Extension” in appending this educational feature to all their courses. 
By this means, not only are the lectures broadened in their scope, and 
the application of the doctrines enunciated indicated, but also vague 
or misunderstood statements of the lectures explained or qualified. 
THE SCHOOL OF APPLIED ETHICS AT PLYMOUTH. 
This is one of the latest experiments in summer instruction, and from 
the uniqueness of its scope and the success it obtained atits first session 
is deserving of a somewhat extended notice. The following sketch of 
this school is extracted from the Review of Reviews for September, 
1891: “In many respects the most noteworthy of the new special 
summer schools insugurated in 1891 has been that of ‘ Applied Ethics,’ 
at Plymouth, Mass., in session from July 1 to August 12, The term 
‘applied ethics’ might not carry to all minds an accurate or complete 
idea of the scope of the school. Possibly the words ‘ practical sociology’ 
would be more truly expressive of the character of the work that was 
actually done at the first session. The history and progress of mankind 
and of communities in matters of religious belief, moral doctrine and 
practice, and in economic life and welfare were the general themes which 
were presented and discussed in many topics and phases.” 
Prof. Felix Adler must be regarded as the founder of the school. It 
was widely advertised; but its modest announcements resulted in the 
assemblage of a considerable body of modern pilgrims at Plymouth. 
Jlergymen, teachers, students, workers in various fields of philanthropy, 
and cultivated men and women of different professions, or of no pro- 
fession, made up audiences which the lecturers found it a pleasure to 
meet. 
Prof. Henry C. Adams, of the University of Michigan and of the 
Interstate Commerce Commission, was the director of the department 
of economics. The plan of the department called for three lectures a 
week by Prof. Adams, as the backbone of the course, dealing method- 
ically with the history of industrial society and economic doctrine, 
principally in England and America, and tracing the rise of the condi- 
tions in the world of labor that are the themes of so much present-day 
discussion and anxiety. Parallel with this broad and consecutive 
course of lectures, dealing with economic progress as a philosophic 
whole, were groups of special lectures upon practical topies. Asarule 
there were three lectures in each group. Thus Prof. John B. Clark, of 
Smith College, discussed modern agrarianism, including talks upon the 
single-tax movement and the Farmers’ Alliance. Mr. Albert Shaw’s 
course treated of social questions suggested by the crowding of cities, 
including housing and transit, slums and pauperism, Gen. Booth’s 
“Darkest England” project, and London movements for the practical 
instruction of the masses. Prof. Taussig, of Harvard University, lec- 
tured upgn cooperation, describing most instructively British distribu- 
tive cooperation, German cooperative credit banks, profit-sharing, and 
productive cooperation in Europe and America, and workingmen’s 
insurance projects. Factory legislation was discussed by Mr. Car- 
roll D. Wright, the United States Commissioner of Labor. President 
Andrews, of Brown University, gave a course upon socialism, stating 
the socialists’ complaint, explaining the socialistic remedy, and sug- 
gesting what he himself believed to be better ways of social reform. 
Prof. Edmund J. James, of Philadelphia, discussed educational ques- 
tions at home and abroad. In connection with the economic lecture
-P-A-G-E-286
  916 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
courses, Mr. Katzenstein conducted a daily class in the principles of 
political economy. 
A second department of the school was that of the history of reli- 
gions, conducted by Prof. Crawford H. Toy, of Harvard University, 
with whom were associated a group of accomplished scholars.. Prof. 
Toy’s course of 18 lectures, dealing with the history of religions as 
a science, explaining its aims and methods, was the basis of the work 
in this department, and was of the highest interest and value. Its 
classifications, historical reviews, examinations of religious systems— 
ancient and modern, and analyses of the relations of religion to gov- 
ernment, society, ethics, art, and philosophy, were a strong groundwork 
for the special courses. Prof. Maurice Bloomfield, of the Johns Hop- 
kins University, lectured upon the origin, doctrines, and ethics of 
Buddhism, Prof. George E. Moore, of Andover Theological Seminary, 
gave the course on “Islam,”.discussing the beginnings, the formative 
period, and the ruling ideas of Mohammedanism. Prof. Morris Jas- 
trow, jr., of the University of Pennsylvania, lectured upon the Baby- 
lonian-Assyrian religion—the gods, spirits, and beliefs of the Baby- 
lonians and Assyrians, their religious literature, and the relations of 
their culture to their religion. The course upon ‘“ The Greek religion” 
was given by Prof. B. I. Wheeler, of Cornell University, who explained 
its general characteristics and its ritual,and set forth the Homeric 
beliefs concerning the soul. Prof. G.-L. Kittridge, of Harvard Univer- 
sity, discoursed of the gods and the religious system of the Norsemen, 
under the general topic of “The Scandinavian religion.” Finally, 
Mr. W. W. Newell, of the Journal of American Folklore, lectured 
upon “The religion of the laity in the Middle Ages.” 
The third department of the school, that of ethics, was under the 
immediate direction of Prof, Adler, of New York, whose course of 18 
lectures, developing a system of applied ethics, with special reference 
to the moral instruction of children, extended through the six weeks. 
In Prof. Adler’s department, Dr. Charlton T. Lewis, of New York, 
gave a course upon criminals, and the State dealing with the theories 
of penal legislation, the history of prisons, and the progress and pros- 
pect of prison reform. Prof.J.B. Thayer, of the Harvard Law School, 
and Mr. Herbert Welsh, of Philadelphia, gave lectures upon the Indian 
question, Mr. Thayer discussing its legal aspects and Mr. Welsh sum- 
marizing its history and politics and the prospects of reform. Mr. 
John H. Finley, of the New York State Charities Aid Society, presented 
a course upon the organization and method of charity in cities. Prof. 
Robert E. Thompson, of the Pennsylvania University, under the theme 
ot “ Politics and ethics,” spoke of the moral aspects of patriotism, party, 
and international relations. Other courses in this department were by 
Mr. W. M. Salter, of Chicago, upon “ Ethical theory;” Mr. W. L. Shel- 
don, of St. Louis, upon “Reform movements among workingmen;” 
Prof. W. E. Sheldon, of Boston, upon “‘ Humane treatment of animals,” 
and Dr. E. G. Hirsh, of Chicago, upon “ The ethical ideal in education.” 
The lectures were given in the old high school of Plymouth, a build- 
ing now nearly a century old. The daily programme interwove the 
departments, no 2 lectures being given at the same hour, and none 
of the departments had a body of exclusive adherents. Receptiveness, 
breadth, and tolerance marked the entire work of the school. The 
series of Sunday afternoon addresses, by representatives of different 
religious creeds, was popular and instructive. At one time or another 
during the six weeks over 200 students, representing 20 States and the 
Dominion of Canada, were in attendance. Of this number about 30

were clergymen, 40 teachers, 20 lawyers, physicians, newspaper men, 
and women, etc., and a number of college professors and instructors. 
The success of this initial season certainly justifies the expectation 
that the school will become a permanent institution. Twenty years 
ago it could scarcely have been possible; and even ten years ago the 
encouragement for its maintenance would have been comparatively 
slight. But the times and their needs have changed. A host of practi- 
cal questions of ethical import confront our American society with a 
distinctiveness that compels recognition, and their study in annual 
summer conferences at Plymouth, in a scientific and impartial spirit, 
can but serve a useful purpose. 
The second annual session of the School of Applied Ethics opened 
at Plymouth, Mass., July 6, 1892,and continued six weeks. The fol- 
lowing is the general announcement of the courses of lectures that 
were given : 
(1) Economics.—In this department there will be the following courses: 
“Changes in theory of political economy since Mill,” Prot. H. C. Adams; 
“Theory of social progress,” Prof. F. H. Giddings; “ Function of philan- 
thropy in social progress,” Prof. F. W. Taussig; ‘Statistical presentation 
of industrial and social questions,” Hon. Carroll D. Wright; ‘Critical 
study of the labor problem and the monopoly problem,” Prof. H. C. 
Adams. 
(2) History of religions.—In this department the week-day lectures will 
be devoted to the study of the religious ideas of the Hebrews. There 
will be six courses of 5 lectures each, as follows: “The Prophets,” Prof. 
Moore; “Persian influence on Judaism,” Dr. Jackson; “The ritual 
law,” Prof. Jastrow; “The Psalms,” Dr. Peters; ‘The wisdom books,” 
Prof. Toy; ‘The Talmud,” Dr. Hirsch. The Sunday afternoon lectures 
will deal in general with the relation of religion to the social questions 
of to-day. 
(3) Ethies.—The principal course in this department will be given by 
William Wallace, M.A. It will consist of 15 lectures on “ Variations of 
the moral standard,” illustrated by the “ History of ethical theories.” 
The shorter courses will probably include an historical treatment of the 
“Relation of church and state,” by Prot. Burgess; The temperance 
question,” “The idea of justice,” and “The moral evolution of our 
political institutions.” 
IL.—SCHOOLS OF LANGUAGES, MUSIC, ORATORY, EXPRESSION, AND 
OF PHYSICAL TRAINING. 
THE SUMMER SCHOOL OF LANGUAGES AT AMHERST COLLEGE, 
The Amherst summer school was established in 1877 by Dr. L. Sauveur, 
with the cooperation of members of the faculty of the college. In 1883 
Dr. Sauveur retired and established a school at Burlington, Vt., since 
which time the Amherst school has been under the direction of Prof. 
William L. Montague. The fundamental idea of this school, as 
expressed in its last announcement, has been ‘to furnish the best 
instruction in different departments at the least possible expense to 
the pupils, and, especially in French and German, to establish a sort 
of foreign society pervaded by such a linguistic atmosphere that every- 
one who enters it, even as a spectator, shall be inspired with new vigor 
and enthusiasm in language studies.” It has been the aim of the 
school to supply the wants of the following classes of students: 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
918 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
First. Teachers, especially American teachers of foreign languages, 
who desire to gain hints and suggestions on the latest and best meth- 
ods of teaching those languages. 
‘Second. Professional and business men and women who would like 
to devote a brief vacation to the study of the humanities; “those who 
enjoy mental culture and literary society while seeking recreation amid 
rural scenes of great natural beauty.” 
Third. Students who desire to begin the study of a language or to 
make up deficiencies, or to gain greater familiarity with languages. 
The amount of study is optional. In French and German there are 
8 or 4 professors in each language, each teacher having usually 3 classes, 
thus giving a variety of instruction adapted to the wants of students of 
different grades of proficiency. The instruction is based on the oral or 
inductive method. 
The morning is devoted to recitations, the afternoons and evenings. 
to lectures and gymnastics or recreation; Saturday to picnics and excur- 
sions. Thus are spent the five weeks that constitute the duration of 
the summer term. 
This school has now held 15 consecutive sessions. Since beginning 
the scope of the instruction has been gradually enlarged, and some sub- 
jects other than the languages taught. During the last session there 
were 22 teachers and lecturers, arranged in 12 departments. The attend- 
ance was over 200. The 12 departments were as follows: French, Ger- 
man, Greek and Latin, Italian, Spanish, English literature, art, physi- 
cal education, chemistry, Anglo-Saxon and early English, library econ- 
omy, and mathematics. The extent to which this school has, by the 
above showing, gone outside of the languages in its instruction might 
seem to render improper classification under the head of schools giving 
instruction in one department of knowledge only, but the fact is that it 
is but recently that this departure has been made, and even now the 
main energy of the school has been along the same line as that to 
which its efforts in the past have been wholly directed, viz, linguistic 
studies. 
THE SAUVEUR SUMMER COLLEGE OF LANGUAGES, 
This is the oldest school of this classin the country. ‘The Sauveur 
Summer College of Languages,” writes Dr. Sauveur, “is the parent, 
the prototype of all the schools of the same order that have since been 
established. The first session was held at Plymouth, N. H., in 1876. 
At that time no summer school of this character was in existence. 
Two years later the institute at Martha’s Vineyard was opened, and 
the following year Chautauqua. From 1877 to 1883 the work of Dr. 
Sauveur was at Amherst College. In 1883 Dr. Sauveur retired, as has 
been said, from the management of the Amherst school, and in 1854 
reopened his school at Burlington, Vt. In 1886 the school was 
moved to Oswego, N. Y., where the sessions of that year and of 1887 
were held. Since then the sessions have been again at the University 
of Vermont, at Burlington. During its existence the school has had 
over 3,000 students in attendance. Half of these have been teachers. 
The attendance for the session of 1890 was 235. The last announce- 
ment showed a faculty of 14 professors, giving instruction in the fol- 
lowing subjects: French, German, Italian, Spanish and modern Greek, 
Latin and ancient Greek; comparative grammar of the English lan- 
guage, and the formation of modern English; English literature, and 
rhetoric. The session lasted from July 7to Augustl, Thisinstitution 
is thus seen to be strictly a school of languages. *The method of instrue-
-P-A-G-E-289
  
  HISTORY OF SUMMER SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 919 
tion is the natural method, the introduction of which in our schools Dr. 
Sauveur has done so much to forward. Dr. Sauveur is the author of a 
large number of educational works, among which are his “ Introdue- 
tion to the Teaching of Living Languages,” ‘Introduction to the 
Teaching of Ancient Languages,” ‘‘Entretiens. sur la Grammaire,” 
“Grammaire Franeaise pour les Anglais,” ‘““Causeries avec mes Eléves,” 
and “La Parole Frangaise.” Besides these, Dr. Sauveur has edited 
and annotated American publications of several of the French classics. 
OTHER SUMMER SCHOOLS OF LANGUAGES. 
For four years there has been a Berlitz summer school of languges- 
at Asbury Park, N. J. The average attendance has been about 75 
students. The present faculty numbers 13. Besides simple instruc- 
tions in French and German, a normal course has been given to teachers, 
in which are explained the various methods of teaching languages. 
A Berlitz summer school opened last year at Chicago, with what 
success I donot know. 
A summer school of languages of Cornell and Iowa colleges was held 
in 1887. Its subsequent history I have been unable to discover. 
SUMMER SCHOOLS OF MUSIC AND OF ORATORY. 
There have been several summer schools of this class, and among 
them the following: The Lexington (Mass.) Normal Music School; 
Batchellor’s Tonic Sol-fa Institute, Philadelphia; Seward’s Tonic Sol-fa 
Institute; Straub’s American Normal Musical Institute; Dr. 8. 8. 
Curry’s School of Expression; The Boston School of Oratory; National 
School of Elocution and Oratory. ss 
THE LEXINGTON, (MASS.) NORMAL MUSIC SCHOOL. 
This school for the training of teachers was established in 1883 and 
has had a successful existence, and now possesses a national reputa- 
tion. In answer to an inquiry regarding the school, the principal, Mr. 
H. E. Holt, writes (1891): 
Seven years ago I opened a summer school for the study of normal methods as 
applied to the teaching or music. We had 11 teachers the first year, and the num- 
ber has steadily increased each year, the term of 1890 numbering 130, with a gradu- 
ating class (three years’ course) of 24. We have teachers from all parts of the 
country, and the number and quality are constantly increasing. Next year we shall 
arrange for a post-graduate course. Weare not able to supply the demand for well- 
trained teachers. I also have classes for the training of teachers on Saturdays in 
Boston. These classes are well attended and the interest is constantly increasing. 
SCHOOL OF EXPRESSION. 
The first summer term of this school, at whose head is Dr. 8.8. 
Curry, was held at Martha’s Vineyard in 1886, It was attended by 
29 students, nearly all of whom were professors in colleges or teachers 
in normal schools or clergymen. 
The second term was held at Saratoga Springs, N. Y., the summer 
of 1887. There were23 students. The clergymen came from 7 different 
denominations. 
The summer session of 1888 was held in Boston. There were gradu- 
ates from 7 different colleges, and the students came from 20 different 
States and Canada. The number of students was 42. 
The summer term of 1889 was held at Lancaster, Mass. The number 
ot students was the same as the preceding year.
-P-A-G-E-290
920 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  The fourth summer term, that of 1890, was held at Newport, R. L, 
and so happy were the students in the place that they voted a request 
to have the session there another year. The next summer school will 
accordingly be held at Newport in 1891. 
The amount of work done by each student in the school has been on 
an average six hours a day for five weeks. The following subjects 
have been taken up: Vocal training, phonology and articulation, vocal 
expression, physical training, pantomimic expression, Shakespeare, 
Browning, Tennyson, extemporaneous speaking, publicreading, methods 
of training voice and vocal expression, the history of pedagogy in rela- 
tion to elocution and expression, principles of educational reformers and 
lessons deducted from them for expression, ete. 
The Boston School of Oratory for special instruction in the synthetic 
philosophy of expression and literature held a summer session of five 
weeks in1890. Summer sessions were also held by the National School 
of Elocution and Oratory, James E. Murdock, president, in Philadel- 
phia; and by the National School of Elocution and Oratory at Ann 
Arbor. The Monroe College of Oratory, Boston, Mass., which held a 
summer session in 1887, is now merged with the Martha’s Vineyard 
Summer Institute, and bears the name of Emerson College of Oratory. 
This school has been exceedingly successful, and had an attendance in 
1890 of over 100 students. 
INTERNATIONAL Y. M, C. A. TRAINING SCHOOL. 
The Young Men’s Christian Association Training School is located 
in Springfield, Mass., and is the first, and as yet, the only institution of 
its kind in existence. Its object is to prepare Christian young men 
to become efficient general secretaries and gymnasium instructors in 
the Young Men’s Christian Associations. The school has therefore two 
departments, the one known as the secretarial and the other as the 
physical or gymnasium department. For five successive summers, 
beginning in 1887, the school has held a summer session of its gymna- 
sium department. At the last session held (1891) there were nine 
instructors, giving instruction in Bible study, organization and methods 
of association work, athletics and aquatics, physiology, physical depart- 
ment management, fencing, wrestling, anthropometry. Swedish system 
of gymnastics, prescription, first aid, Delsarte system, library and lit- 
erature of physical education. There were also five special lectures. 
The number of men registered for the five sessions were respectively 
28, 50, 57, 48, and 38, “showing,” says the secretary, “the great increase 
at first and the gradual falling off now that the special stress of the first 
call for gymnasium directors has passed, as more thoroughly trained 
men are put forward by the regular schools to fill the positions.” 
It has been decided to hold no summer session in 1892 and to have 
instead a ten days’ conference, which shall be open to all men inter- 
ested in the physical department and afford opportunity for advance- 
ment by means of lectures, conferences, and practice, but be less 
formal and require less time and expense than a regular school session. 
Other schools teaching single subjects that have held summer sessions 
are: School for Swedish Gymnastics, at Boston; School of Elocution 
and Oratory, at Thousand Isles; School of Languages, (Alfred Hall, 
principal), Prudence Island, R. I.; Western Normal Musie School, 
Highland Park, Ill.; Eastern Normal Music School, New Brighton, 
Staten Island, N. Y.; Manual Training School, St. Louis, Mo. Con- 
cerning these schools the Bureau has been unable to obtain informa- 
tion. Many of them are undoubtedly not now in existence.

PART III. 
SUMMER SCHOOLS GIvING INSTRUCTION IN SEVERAL BRANCHES. 
  I.   
CHAUTAUQUA, 
Under the title of the Chautauqua movement are embraced a variety 
of methods for the popularization of knowledge inthe United States. The 
description of the growth of these agencies forms one of the most inter- 
esting and remarkable chapters in the history of educational develop- 
ment in this country. The almost marvelous growth of this movement 
within the period of a few years offers a striking testimony to what 
economists call “‘an effective demand” upon the part of the general 
public for aliberal education. “The ramifications of Chautauqua would 
stagger belief,” says a recent writer,! “did we not know how steam 
and electricity have developed the world into the round table of these 
latter days and with their weaver’s shuttle laced together the thoughts 
ofmen. Chautauqua is a marvelous illustration of the law that often 
great social and economic forces flow with a tidal sweep over commu- 
nities only half conscious of them. Its 100,000 registered students, 
half of whom are between 30 and 40 years of age, and its practi- 
eally endless courses of study make this home college the realization of 
a world university, the summer assembly being its visible center. 
About one in every thousand of the people of the United States 
owns the shibboleth Chautauqua, while more than one in every hun- 
dred visits its yearly gatherings. It exists in every State and Terri- 
tory. Its circles have rolled from Chautauqua Lake to Canada, Mexico, 
Central America, Chile, Great Britain, France, Russia, Bulgaria, Syria, 
Cape Colony, Persia, India, Australia, China, Japan, the isles of the 
sea, Hawaii, Alaska.” 
The present Chautauqua embraces several instrumentalities by which 
it performs its work. These agencies are of three general classes: (1) 
voluntary home reading during the year, with reports of progress to 
headquarters; (2) scholarly study and professional training by corre- 
spondence, and (3) great popular summer meetings at Chautauqua and 
other places. 
Historically speaking, the whole movement is the outgrowth of a 
kind of religious folkmote, the camp meeting, which was transformed 
at Fair Point on Lake Chautauqua into a Sunday-school assembly in 
August, 1874. 
The idea of utilizing the camp meeting for educational purposes, the thought of 
a ‘‘camp-meeting institute,” where methods of teaching should be cultivated, was 
suggested by Silas Farmer, the antiquary and historian of Detroit, Mich., in the 
Sunday School Journal, as early as April, 1870; but a similar, and perhaps larger, 
idea was early cherished by Lewis Miller, of Akron, Ohio, the inventor of the Buck- 
eye mower, which has revolutionized the farming machinery of America. This 
practical-minded, large-hearted, and wealthy man, who all his life had been act- 
ively engaged in Sunday-school work, and who was one of the earliest and staunch- 
est promoters of mechanical and agricultural education in Ohio, joined hands with 
Dr. (now Bishop) John H. Vincent for the improvement of Sunday-school teaching 
by a generous alliance with science and literature. Dr. Vincent, for many years a 
leader in American Sunday-school work, believed most strongly in the increase of 
‘‘week-day power” by the intimate association of secular and religious learning. 
He believed in the harmony of religion with every-day life. In the summer of 1873 
the two men, Mr. Miller and Dr. Vincent, visited the Fourth Erie Conference camp

  meeting of the Methodist Episcopal Church, held at Fair Point, on Lake Chautanqua, 
in southern New York. They chose that Fair Point for a local establishment of 
“The Chautauqua Sunday-School Assembly.” 
To understand the historical development of the modern Chautauqua, with its 
many-sided educational and social features, we must never lose sight of its original 
democratic and religious foundations. Whatever may be the tendencies and aspi- 
rations, the variations and specializations of this popular educational experiment, 
the folkmote remains the basis of all. The Chautauqua Sunday-School Assembly 
begen its sessions on the first Tuesday evening in August, 1874, and that evening has 
continued to be the time for the regular ‘‘ assembly opening,” although fully one 
month of educational work along secular lines now precedes this memorable date in 
the Chantanqua calendar. The first distinctive objects of Chautauqua are insep- 
arably connected with Biblical study in a Sunday-school normal institute. The 
early programmes of the assembly show a rich succession of lectures on practical Sun- 
chool work and on the Bible, with conferences and discussions on methods of 
aching. Into the religious current came, in successive years, more and more trib- 
utary streams representing modern science and literature in their relations to life 
and thought. One can distinctly trace in the records of Chautauqua the beginnings 
of all its modern educational tendencies, whether in pedagogics, art, social science, 
or the highereducation. Map-drawing, blackboard sketching, the study of Biblical 
geography in a great relief map of Palestine made of turf and. stones, open-air talks, 
concerts, and even popular entertainments were not absent from those early pro- 
grammes. Prominent among the early features of Chautauqua were its wonderful 
eatholicity, its broad spirit of toleration, its democratic and widely representative 
character. From the very outset members of all the leading Protestant churches 
joined in the work. Church congresses were held at Chautauqua, and prominent 
clergymen from various denominations addressed the assemblies. Among the 600 
students the very first year there were representatives from 25 States and from the 
provinces of Canada.! 
Beginning thus as a popular gathering for the discussion of methods 
of Sunday-school teaching Chautauqua has gradually extended its 
scope and differentiated its methods of instruction until at present the 
Chautauqua University embraces the following distinct departments: 
I. The Chantanqua assembly. 
1. The summer meetings at Chautanqua. 
2. The Sunday school normal department. 
3. The schools of language. 
4. The Chautanqua teachers’ retreat. 
II. The Chautauqua literary and scientific circles. 
Il. The Chautauqua College of Liberal Arts, formerly known as “The © Ravine 
University,” and with powers as prov ided in its charter. 
IV. The Chautauqua School of Theology. 
V. The Chautauqua press. 
VI. Chautauqua extension and summer assemblies. 
The summer assembly at Chautauqua is held in July and August of 
every year. The city of Chautauqua occupies a well-wooded, naturally 
terraced land at a point on the northern shore of Chautauqua Lake, 
and contains more than five hundred. artistic and attractive cottages, 
a large hotel, and many other buildings which are used for public exer- 
cises, lectures, and recitations. A large model of Palestine, 300 feet 
long, and a miniature representation of modern Jerusalem are amoig 
the peculiar attractions of this academic town. 
The exercises that fill the two months’ session of this ‘summer uni- 
versity,” as it has been called, are extremely varied in nature, but may 
be classed under the two general heads: (1) The public daily programme, 
which includes courses of lectures, Sunday sermous, single addresses, 
concerts, readings, etc. These are free to all citizens alike. (2): The 
educational classes, which comprise the college of neha arts, 
teachers’ retreat, school of sacred literature, school of music, school of 
physical education, anda large number of other departments, such as 
elocution and oratory, ee and painting, wood-carving, ‘cooking,

CHAUTAUQUA TEACHERS’ RETREAT, 
  Francis W. Parker, principal. 
1. The nature of the course: 
The faculty of the teachers’ retreat will present and illustrate the system of 
teaching and training now in operation in the professional training class of 
the Cook County Normal School, by talks on psychology, pedagogics, and 
methods, and lessons upon the principles and methods of teaching the natural 
sciences, geography, history, elocution, literature, and number. 
The distinctive feature of the professional training may be designated by the 
word concentration. AJ] the teaching and training is concentrated upon the 
central subject of life and the laws of life, physical, mental, and moral. 
All the talks and lessons of every teacher will be in the closest relation and 
under one common principle. The director will explain the principles of 
psychology and pedagogics, and each teacher in his or her department will 
illustrate and apply to practical schoolroom work the theory presented by the 
director.

    THE CHAUTAUQUA LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC CIRCLES. 
In the fourth year of the Chautauqua experiment the now famous 
Cc. L. S. G., or Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circles, began to 
widen from that beautiful highland lake, Chautauqua, over all the 
country. There are now about 2,000 circles in active life, and with a 
total enrolled membership that lacks but little of 100,000. Since the 
organization of the plan in 1878 there have been fully. 180,000 students 
enrolled. 
The essentials of the reading-circle plan are these: 
(1) A four years’ course of reading, including selections in English from the 
ancient class) history, literature, science, and art., Each year of the four is 
devoted especially to a great nation, and is known as ‘‘the Greek year,” ‘the 
Roman year,” ‘‘the English year”, or ‘the American year.” No attempt is made 
to study languages or mathematics. The course is general and follows in a measure 
the subjects taught in the average college; it gives what has been called the “col- 
lege outlook.” (2) Certain books, many of them specially prepared by well-known 
authors. are designated each year by a council of 6 prominentmen (3) A monthly 
magazine, The Chautauquan, contains supplementary articles on the subjects of the 
course by leading writers of the day, general miscellaneous matter on current affairs, 
and several departments designed to aid the reader, such as apportionment of the 
course by the week and month, notes on the books, outlines of reading, word studies, 
etc. (4) A membership book sent to each reader includes analyses of the required 
books and question papers (memoranda) to be filled out and returned to the office. 
The papers are intended to aid the reader in reviewing and systematically arranging 
the facts and principles he has read. They are not examinations, nor are they 
regarded as such. (5) Local circles may be formed in any community where three 
or more readers desire the benefits of comradeship. There are about 2,000 such cir- 
cles now in active life. (6) A certificate is granted at the completion of the course 
to all who report themselves as having read the required literature. This certifi- 
cate states only this fact, and has not the remotest connection with a degree. This 
step in the Chautauqua system fails unless it leads people to continue the 
habit of reading. Therefore a large number of advanced courses, prepared by spe- 
cialists, are offered. The four years’ course is general, and enables the reader to 
find a congenial subject for further and particular study. These advanced-courses 
meet this demand for specialization. There is a Young Folks’ Reading Union, 
designed to encourage among the youth the reading of the best books, and a Teach- 
ers’ Reading Union, with a three years’ course in professional lines. 
The present principal of the C. L. S. C. is Rev. J. L. Hurlbut, p. p., 
and the following description of the work of which he is at the head is 
from his pen and extracted from a circular issued by the management 
of this branch of the Chautauqua enterprise: 
During the assembly session of 1878 the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle 
was instituted. The plan involved a course of reading and study covering the prin- 
cipal subjects of the college curriculum, but omitting of necessity its drill in lan- 
uages and mathematics, giving to the English reader an outlook over the field of 
learning and some acquaintance with the masterpieces of literature, ancient and 
modern; employing handbooks and compendiums for the mastery of outlines, and 
appointing more extensive works to be read—a course which the individual could 
pursue alone, if necessary, yet adapted for associated study, sufficiently simple to 
invite the masses and to lead them on without discouragement from its difficulties 
or its extent, yet so thorough as not to be deemed superficial by the more learned, 
Above all, it was to bring the six secular days of the week into harmony of purpose 
with the Sabbath, not only by recognizing the Bible as a department of its study, 
but more especially by having the entire course penetrated with the spirit of rever- 
ence and of faith.

The scheme was broached to a few eminent literary men and some leading educa- 
tors, with a view to obtain the benefit of their criticisms and suggestions. It received 
a hearty indorsement from all who took the trouble to investigate it; among others, 
from President Chadbourne, of Williams College; President Warren, of Boston Uni- 
versity; and Dr. Howard Crosby, then chancellor of the University of the City of 
New York. The honored William Cullen Bryant gave it a strong recommendation 
in a personal letter to Dr. Vincent, almost the last written by his pen, less than a 
month before his death, In it he wrote: 
New York, May 18, 1878. 
My Dear Sir: I can not be present at the meeting called to organize the Chau- 
tauqua Literary and Scientific Circle, but I am glad that such a movement is on foot, 
and wish it the fullest success. There is an attempt to make science, ora knowledge 
of the laws of the material universe, an ally of the school which denies a separate 
spiritual existence and a future life—in short, to borrow of science weapons to be 
used against Christianity. The friends of religion, therefore, confident that one truth 
never contradicts another, are doing wisely when they seek to accustom the people 
at large to think and to weigh evidence as well as believe. By giving a portion of 
their time to a vigorous training of the intellect and a study of the best books, men 
gain the power to deal satisfactorily with questions with which the mind might 
otherwise become bewildered. It is true that there is no branch of human knowl- 
edge so important as that which teaches the duties we owe to God and to each other, 
and that there is no law of the universe, sublime and wonderful as it may be, so 
worthy of being fully known as the law of love, which makes him who obeys it a 
blessing to his species, and the universal observance of which would put an end to 
the large proportion of the evils which affect mankind. Yet is a knowledge of the 
results of science, and such of its processes as lie most open to the popular mind, 
important for the purpose of showing the different spheres occupied by science and 
religion, and preventing the inquirer from mistaking their divergence from cach 
other for opposition? 
I perceive this important advantage in the proposed organization, namely, that 
those who engage in it will mutually encourage’each other. It will give the members 
a common pursuit, which always begets a feeling of brotherhood “They will havea 
common topic of conversation and discussion, and the consequence will be that many 
who, if they stood alone, might grow weary of the studies which are recommended to 
them, will be incited to perseverance by the interest which they see others taking in 
them. It may happen in rare instances that a person of eminent mental endowments, 
which otherwise might have remained uncultivated and unknown, will be stimulated 
in this manner to diligence, and put forth unexpected powers, and, passing rapidly 
beyond the rest, become greatly distinguished, and take a place among the lumin- 
aries of the age. 
I shall be interested to watch, during the little space of life which may yet remain 
to me, the progress and results of the plan which has drawn from me this letter. 
Lam, sir, very truly, yours, 
" W. C. Bryant. 
Rey. Dr. Jonn H. VINCENT. 
The course of study is planned to cover four years, and may be accomplished by 
most readers in an hour a day during ten months of each year. Of course no unlet- 
tered person can secure a finished education by merely reading an hour per diem for 
four years, yet so much time spent with thoughtful and wisely-chosen books will 
impart to any mind a knowledge of literature, a measure of intelligence, and an 
intellectual training by no means to be despised. It embraces the general subjects 
of history, science, literature, and Bible study, with a few branches which might be 
included under home and character. As at present arranged the four years’ course 
is as follows: 
1891-92: American history, American literature, history and literature of the far 
East, physiology and hygiene, questions of public interest, German literature, reli- 
gious literature. 
1892-93: Greek history, Greek literature, Greek mythology, ancient Greek life, cir- 
cle of the sciences, zoology, chemistry, philanthropy, religious literature. 
1893-94: Roman history, Latin literature, human nature, political economy, art, 
philosophy, phys: physical geography, uses of mathematics, religious literature. 
1894-95: English history, English literature, English composition, astronomy, 
geology, pedagogy, readings from French literature, social questions, religious litera- 
ture. 
‘The larger part of these readings is contained in books most of which have been espe- 
cially prepared for the C. L. 8. C., since the circle requires works of a peculiar quality, 
not precisely that of the school text-book nor that for popular readings, but uniting 
in a measure both characteristics. For each year from six to eight books are read,

costing generally about $5, for the large sales—aggregating more than 300,000 vol- 
umes per year—enable the publishers to give the books at low prices. A part of the 
course is contained in The Chautauquan, a magazine published by Rey. Theodore L. 
Flood, D. D., Meadville, Pa., as the organ of the C.L.S$.C. Between the covers of 
this monthly are found serial papers on subjects of the course, reports from work- 
ing circles, plans and suggestions for reading, and many articles of gengre interest. 
It is a fact worth mentioning that such a magazine, containing only solid literary 
and scientific matter, and without stories, circulates to the extent of 60,000 copies. 
A helpful element of the plan is that of simultaneous study by all classes. The 
studies for each year are portioned out among the months as a suggestion, but not 
as a requirement; and the subjects are so arranged that all four ciasses shall study 
them during the same year. Thus the studies for 1891 and 1892 are the same for all 
members of the circle, but constitute the work of the first year for the class which 
begins in 1891 and will finish in 1895, of the second year for the class of 1894, of the 
third year for the class of 1893, and of the fourth year for the class of 1892. It isas 
if a college, seniors, juniors, sophomores, and freshmen were together in the same 
text-books, but one class beginning, another ending, the curriculum. In a college 
or school this would not be practicable, since the first year’s course is a necessary 
stepping-stone to the second year’s; but in the C.L.8.C. the work of each year is 
complete in itself, and does not relate closely either to what has been or what will 
be studied. The advantage of this plan is that in many places where four separate 
classes could not be carried on successfully a circle may be formed, since all are 
pursuing the same studies. 
The flexibility of the plan is such that it admits either individual or associated 
study. Some follow it alone, without companionship except in the consciousness 
that more than 60,000 fellow-students are in line with themselves. Others find it 
helpful to unite in “local circles,” or segments of the general circle. These local 
circles count up among the thousands, and are of all sizes, from three members te 
several hundred. There are little groups of ladies who meet, with their sewing, and 
listen to one reading from the course; travelers on the railroad conning their Chau- 
tauqua text-books; home circles where the kings of England are reviewed at the 
breakfast table; social gatherings with criticisms and cream mingled in pleasant 
proportion, and ambitious organizations with lecture courses and public discussions 
in the town hall. 
There is an arrangement whereby each member, however distant, is kept in con- 
stant connection with the office of the circle. This is at Buffalo, N. Y., where Miss 
K. F. Kimball, the secretary, aided by her corps of assistants, maintains a supervision 
over the details of the work. With every mail come letters of inquiry, and, in 
answer thereto, circulars explaining the plan and blanks for those desiring member- 
ship are dispatched. Applications for union with the circle are received, inclosin, 
the annual fee of 50 cents, which is the sole expense of the association, except, oi 
course, the cost of books. 
Each year there is sent to every member a membership book containing sugges- 
tions for study, special test papers, encouraging addresses from the chancellor and 
counselors, and ‘‘ outline memoranda” on the current topics of study. These latter 
are sent both as a guide and an examination, and consist of four pages of questions 
on the readings of the year, with blanks for ‘answers. The items of printing and 
postage in sending all this material to 60,000 people are considerable, Lest any may 
imagine a financial aim in the enterprise let it be remarked, in passing, that the fees 
received scarcely cover the expenses of the office, and that the chancellor receives 
absolutely nothing for his services. 
This circle, though not an ellipse, is remarkable in the possession of two centers, 
65 miles apart—one at Buffalo, N. Y., the other at Chautauqua. A beautiful wooded 
slope on the second plateau from the lake, and removed a little from the crowd, was 
chosen as the special gathering place of the C. L. 8. C. In honor of the greatest 
man in all the Christian centuries, the apostle who united broad culture with deep 
religious enthusiasm, it has been named ‘St. Paul’s Grove.” Here, embowered under 
lofty beeches and oaks, rises a white Grecian temple, whose open sides and pillars 
seen through the foliage remind one of the Parthenon. Within this building, ‘the 
Hall of Philosophy,” are held the ‘‘ Round Table” conferences during the annual 
assembly. 
Outside ‘‘the Golden Gate” of this grove the members of the graduating class 
assemble on the annual recognition day, and after aresponsive exercise they march 
with songs and the scattering of flowers through the gate and under the arches inte 
the hall, where they are formally recognized by the chancellor and his associates 
as members of ‘The Society of the Hall in the Grove,” which is the alumni associa- 
tion of the C.L.S.C. 
The founder of the C.L. S.C. has a touch of sentiment in his nature, which dis- 
closes itself in many of the minor details of the plan. For instance, there are cer- 
tain ‘‘memorial days” to be celebrated throughout the year, as ‘‘Shakspeare’s Day,” 
ED 92 59  
-P-A-G-E-300
  930 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
“ Xddison’s Day,” “ Bryant’s Day,” and other birthdays of great men in literature. 
There is ‘Inauguration Day,” commemorative of the cirele’s organization; ‘“ Open- 
ing Day,” October 1, when the members are supposed to open their text-books for 
the year; and certain special Sundays throughout the year. Selections are given 
for reading on each of these days, and at noon of each “memorial day” the big bell 
at Chautauqua rings. Tis said that all true Chautauquans, beside what shores 
soever they may dwell, can hear its distant echoes! } 
There are also ‘‘ camp fires,” when the members gather in the evening and sing 
Chautauqua songs and listen to Chautauqua speeches by the light of blazing bon- 
fires ; there are annual ‘“‘ vigils” on the Sunday nights before and after the recogni- 
tion day; and there is the Sunday afternoon “ vesper service,” with its simple ritual 
and hymns of praise. Some may look lightly on these exercises, but the wise know 
that it is by sentiments and enthusiasms that the world of mankind is moved and 
great results are wrought. 
In as much as the readers represent not only every age in life and every social grade, 
but also all diversities of taste, information, and intelligence, it is evident that no 
one course of reading can be equally satisfactory to all. Some wish a course more 
extensive, and some desire an examination more thorough than others. Hence, 
besides the regular course, there is each year an additional list of four books on the 
subjects of the reading, called “The Garnet Series,” with an outline memoranda 
examination, rewarded with a garnet seal on the diploma for every year that it is 
pursued. There is also a more complete examination upon the regular course which 
wins another seal for each year. By these methods both the higher and the popular 
demands are in a measure supplied. 
Another demand among the members of the cirele arose very early in its history. 
Many wrote for directions in following out special lines of study in whieh they had 
become interested. The majority of the members were in country homes, many of 
them distant from public libraries, and, while eager for knowledge, knew not in 
what direetion to seek it. Hence arose a necessity of special courses for members 
whe desired to supplement the general plan or who had completed the regular 
course. Many of these special courses have been mapped out, and others are in 
preparation. As the completion of the regular course at the expiration of four years 
will be rewarded with a diploma, so for each of the special courses pursued a seal 
will be affixed. Thus, there are special studies in Roman history and literature (sear- 
let seal), Engiish history and literature (blue seal), Greek history and literature 
(crimson seal), astronomy, secular normal study, and others. These courses have 
been arranged with great care. For instance, in the selection of one course a state- 
ment of the plan in writing was furnished to 50 leading clergymen and theological 
professors, whe were requested to recommend suitable works on its various subjects. 
Forty-five sent answers more or less extensive, which were tabulated, and the hun- 
dred or more works suggested were carefully examined until 10 standard books were 
finally chosen and placed upon the list. An inspection of the reeords and of the letters filed in the general office at Buffalo 
reveals many noteworthy facts. Names are found representing all creeds and all 
lands. There are several hundred members in the Dommion of Canada, cireles and 
individual students in England, Scotland, Continental Hurope, South Africa, Aus- 
tralia, India, Japan, the Sandwich Islands, and Alaska. All denominations of 
Christians and many non-Christian bedies are represented in the mexibership. 
Though no religious tests are required, yet the course is thoroughly evangelical, 
and an atmosphere of earnest. Christianity overshadows the cirel 
As to the beneficial results of the organization there ean scarcely be a question. 
Any system which will bring thousands of people into communication with the 
thought of the world can not fail of blessing therace. Already this movement has 
quickened many into higher intellectual lite. More than one young man has writ- 
ten to the office that by it he has been awakened to a hunger after knowledge, and 
has left the circle for the larger culture of the college. In one of the leading local 
circles a honse servant became a member, soon showed herself the brightest scholar 
in the company, resolved to obtain a higher education, and by dint of saving, with 
some assistance of friends who perceived her talents, entered the State normal 
school, where she has since graduated. It has led many young men to employ in 
study evenings that might have been wasted, or worse than wasted, in the saloon; 
and has substituted strong, thoughtful hooks for sensational novels in the hands of 
many young ladies. . 
It has breathed an atmosphere of culture around homes of poverty and relieved 
the dull round of woman’s never-ending work by worthy themes of thought and 
conversation. It has enabled middle-aged people to supplement the deficiencies, 
keenly felt, of their early education. One man wrote: 
“Tam so grateful to you that I can’t express what I feel. Iam a hard-workin, 
man. I have six children, and I work hard to keep them in school. Since I foun¢ 
out about your circle I am trying my best to keep up, so that my boys will see what 
father does, just for an example to them.”

Another wrote: “T am a nightwatchman, and I read as I come on my night rounds 
fo the lights.” A steamboat pilot wrote that he found the course of great value to 
him, ‘‘because,” he says, ‘‘ when I stand on deck onstormy nights I have something 
- to think about, and you know when one has not taken care of his thoughts they will 
run away with him, and he will think about what he ought not.” 
We knew of a merchant’s clerk and his wife who, except during the summer vaca- 
tion, devoted the morning hours from 5 to 7 o’clock to study, in order to leave their 
evenings free for the claims of home, society, and church. An Army officer's wife 
wrote from the plains that no other white woman was living within 60 miles, and 
the nearest bookstore was 300 miles distant, so that she was waiting impatiently 
three months for her text-books, and when they came she fairly wept with delight 
at the realization that she was at last brought into some communion with seekers 
after culture. Such testimonies as these might be multipled by the hundred, if it 
were necessary, to show that the Chautanqua Literary and Scientific Circle brings 
valuable results to the world. 
As has been already mentioned, the office secretary of this branch of 
the Chautauqua work is Miss Kate F. Kimball. The following extracts 
from her annual report for 1891 will serve to further illustrate the pres- 
ent status of the work: 
The class of 1894, the new class, which is always a sort of index of the popular mind, 
has enrolled nearly 15,000 members—a gain of more than 1,000 over last year's class, 
while the membership in some of the Southern and far Western States is double that 
of last year. The Pacific coast sends 1,000 new members, Canada 400, the Dakotas 
150, Texas more than 300, while the States of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and 
Illinois have together contributed more than 5,000. * * * The graduate enroll- 
ment of the class of 1890 carried the membership of the C. L. 8. C.:lumni up to 
25,000, and a full tenth of the number have been actually engaged in post graduate 
courses of study during the past year. * * * A growing disposition to hold 
weekly instead of semimonthly meetings is worthy of note. * * The conven- 
tion idea and the work of the Chautauqua unions are so closely allied that one natur- 
ally leads up to the other, There have been Chautauqua unions atall periods in the - 
history of the C. L. 8. C., but never have they done better work than in this year 
1890-91, 
THE CHAUTAUQUA COLLEGE OF LIBERAL ARTS. 
The Chautauqua College of Liberal Arts is an historical outgrowth 
of the Normal School of Languages, first opened in 1879, the same year 
as the Teachers’ Retreat. At first each school of language was inde- 
pendent of all the rest, but they have now been coordinated with other 
subjects into one institution. The present principal of the college is 
the Hebrew scholar William R. Harper, lately called to the presidency 
of the new Chicago University. 
Thé Chautauqua College is an institution designed to aid the following persons in 
the acquisition of a liberal and practical education: Those young persons who are 
unable to leave home or business to attend college; those more advanced in years, 
who have been compelled to give up a college course once begun; those mature men 
and women who desiré to make amends for the educational omissions of their early 
ears, 
ae lt is not claimed that the correspondence system of teaching is superior to oral 
teaching; nor that it is destined to supersede oral teaching; nor that it can compete 
with oral teaching on anything like equal terms; nor that a class, school, college, or 
university, dependent for its entire work upon pen, paper, and post, should be 
sought by the student in preference to established resident institutions. 
It is claimed that the majority of those who are likely to ayail themselves of the 
advantages of correspondence instruction are actuated by an earnest purpose to 
obtain an advanced education, by any means which are available to them; that wise 
direction through correspondence, by competent and experienced teachers, is calen- 
lated to produce better results than can be expeeted from unaided individual effort; 
that teaching by. correspondence can be successfully applied to a course of study so 
wide and comprehensive that one who masters it will secure a culture that would 
rightly be called liberal; that it tends to form critical habits of study; that itallows 
tests of the student’s acquirement as rigid as can be desired by the highest standard 
of educational excellence. 
This purpose is accomplished by a threefold method of instruction—(1) by cor- 
respondence; (2) by the work offered in the summer schools of the college at Chau- 
tanqua, N. Y.; (3) by a system of Chautauqua University extension lectures in 
 
-P-A-G-E-302
932 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
  any town or city making the necessary arrangements. The degrees usually given 
_ by colleges and universities may be granted by the Chautauqua trustees, through 
the college of liberal arts, upon the satisfactory completion of the prescribed curric- 
ula. Sixteen courses are required for any baccalaureate degree. Such precautions 
are taken as will prevent an unworthy candidate from taking a degree. In no case 
is any honorary degree conferred. r 
(1) By correspondence: The scheme of study in each of the schools of the college 
is arranged in ‘‘ courses,” each of which is equivalent to the amount of work expected 
of a resident student, in one subject, in all school years. It is equal to ten hours 
of study a week. The number of lessons sent out in each course is equal to thirty- 
two, upon which an equal number of recitations will be required. ‘These lessons 
may be sent out, one, two, or four at atime, as the instructor may find most effective. 
Examinations of the most rigid character, in the presence of judicious and responsi- 
ble witnesses, will be required of each regular student. 
(2) By summer schools under the regular professors of the summer session of the 
C. C. L. A., students may arrange for taking courses in the curricula and an exam- 
ination at the clese of the session. 
(3) By Chautauqua University extension lectures. 
In many cases three or more students form a class for study. The benefits of this 
plan are obvious and it is strongly recommended by the college officers. 
Upon the successful completion of any course in the curriculum of the college, a 
certificate, properly signed, is given to the student. The presentation, by a student, 
to the hoard of trustees, of sixteen certificates on a prescribed curriculum, will en- 
title the candidate to a diploma and a degree. 
While the college year begins October 1, students are received at any time. No 
Jessons are corrected in the correspondence schools from June 1 to October 1, except 
by special arrangement. No limit is fixed to the time which students may take to 
complete the required courses, though it is earnestly recommended that the student 
make every effort to do the work in the time suggested by the respective professors, 
Tt is recommended that the students of the College of Liberal Arts attend the sum- 
mer session at Chautauqua. They thus become acquainted with their professors, 
and much advance their work. 
Any subject taught in the college may be studied by students who desire to avail 
themselves of such study without expecting or desiring to complete a whole curric- 
ulum. 
Those desiring to complete a whole curriculum in the college must present satis- 
factory evidence of proficiency, either by examination or approved certificate. 
Curricula leading to the degrees of bachelor of arts and bachelor of science are 
offered. For each degree ten courses are prescribed, and six are elective. 
After admission the following is prescribed for the degree of bachelor of arts— 
one course in each of the following subjects: Greek, Latin, mathematics, English, 
German or French, history, psychology and ethics, political economy, physical 
sciences, and biological sciences. The additional six courses may be chosen from 
the courses announced under the various departments, subject only to the rules gov- 
erning elective courses. 
After admission the following is prescribed for the degree of bachelor of science— 
one course in each of the following subjects: Latin, English, German or French, 
mathematics, history, psychology and ethics, political economy, geology, physical 
sciences, biological sciences. The privileges and requirements of the six additional 
courses are the same as those for the degree of B. A. above. 
(1) Not more than two courses may be chosen from one department of study. 
(2) The student’s choice of electives may be indicated one course at a time as he 
may prefer, but when once made it may not be changed. 
(3) More than three courses may be pursued by students wishing special prepara- 
tion in certain subjects, though only two will be counted toward a degree. 
(4) In taking more than one course in a subject the student must proceed in order 
from one upward, so that the subject may be developed naturally. 
It should be distinctly understood that the Chautauqua College of Liberal Arts is 
quite distinct from the literary and scientific circles and from the Teachers’ Retreat. 
The province of the latter is to teach educational methods. TheC. L. S.C. attempts 
to give a general outlook upon the world of literature and science by means of 
systematic courses of reading in English. The college is a long step forward from 
_these beginnings. It has introduced classical and other linguistic courses, including 
French and German. The reading circles are under general direction through cor- 
respondence with a central secretary. The college has distinct departments, each 
under individual direction. In the local circles intellectual stimulus comes from 
the contact of members and from joint discussion, as well as from private reading. 
In the college there is direct contact between special students and individual 
instructors in lecture or laboratory courses during the summer session of six weeks. 
Afterward, if the student desires it, there is careful supervision of home studies

  along specific lines by means of correspondence, written reports or examinations, at 
least once a month, The Chautauqua circles give no degrees, only certificates or 
seals, indicating the completion of a four years’ course of private reading, with 
greater or less honor according to the character of the examinations passed or the 
reports made, The college proposes to give degrees, although it has never yet done 
so and never will do so except in cases of absolute merit as shown by a proper com- 
bination and satisfactory completion of a certain number of elective courses. 
The correspondence system of college teaching is based on (1) printed instructions, 
sent out by the department in which the student has chosen to work; (2) on skill- 
fully constructed examination papers, which test the student’s understanding 
of what he may have read; and (3) on written answers or reports, sent in to the 
department at least once a month, and then carefully corrected and returned to the 
student. The system develops independence of character, habits of investigation 
and self-help, and the power of accurate and exact statement on the part of the 
pupil. It necessarily involves thoroughness of preparation and complete command 
of the entire month’s work, which has covered the ground of what would ordinarily 
occupy many recitations in a class. Class work, although undoubtedly superior, 
has its evils, as every college student well knows. The oral recitation is hurried, 
and covers for each individual only a narrow vange of knowledge. In large classes, 
students are infrequently called up, and, when they have recited, they sometimes 
become inattentive and take a long mental rest before beginning to calculate the 
probabilities of another call. It is usually thought by students and instructors that 
written examinations are, on the whole, the best and fairest all-around test of a 
man’s ability and attainments. Such severe trials of the knowledge of the pupil 
and of the patience of the teacher are these written examinations that they are not 
generally resorted to more than once or twice a term; in fact, under the old college 
régime only once a year, in the dreaded ‘‘annuals.” It should be remembered that 
the correspondence system requires at least nonthly written examinations, from 
October to June. These are rarely if ever taken by persons who have shirked their 
duty, who have crammed and cribbed for a special test, or who are disposed to cheat 
in the absence ofa proctor. Correspondence students are generally persons of mature 
years, who are very much in earnest, and who have studied for self-improvement or 
a genuine love of the subject rather than for a diploma or for class rank. 
Of course the correspondence system is no adequate substitute for the constant 
drill, perfect regularity, personal supervision, suggestive power, active stimulus, 
and generous rivalry of class-room work, in the very sight and hearing of a vigor- 
ous and enthusiastic instructor, day after day, and throughout four years. Nosane 
man would ever think of advocating education by correspondence as superior to 
education by contact. It is for the very sake of establishing personal relations 
between master and pupil, between the individual and society, that the summer 
session of the Chautauqua College of Liberal Arts was dev: Although a six 
weeks’ course of lectures and of class work seems very trifling, as compared with 
the thirty-six or more weeks of the college year, it should be remembered that one 
college lecture or one sermon is sometimes enough to determine a life choice. If a 
college professor can sometimes strike sparks of intellectual light in fifty minutes, 
he ought to be able tokindle some sort of a fire in the course of six weeks. If aman’s 
scientific career, like that of Prof. Joseph Henry, once secretary of the Smithsonian, 
is sometimes determined by the reading of a single book, ‘‘ although by no means 
a profound work,” as he himself admitted, it is possible that the suggestion of a 
course of good reading for an earnest student at Chautauqua may bear rich fruit in 
coming years, Many a university student in Germany, England, and America will 
admit that the best results of a professor’s teaching are introductions to special 
literature and to new vistas of scientific interest. Many a doctor of philosophy, 
returning from years of foreign note-taking, has left his voluminous note books 
unused and has sought fresh knowledge and inspiration in books recommended by 
his professors or in more recent literature. 
Finally, it should be borne in mind that the Chantauqua correspondence system is 
designed for those, and for those only, who, by the force of circumstances, are pre- 
vented from attending a regular college. As Principal Harper truly says: ‘‘ There 
are thousands of men and women unable to avail themselves of oral assistance, who, 
nevertheless, are eager to study. It is surely an advantage of the correspondence 
system that it can aid this large class, who otherwise would have no help, and 
would make no progress.” Popular interest in higher education is evinced by the 
27,000 local reading circles, embracing, since the original organization in 1878, more 
than 180,000 members and a present membership of nearly 100,000. The Chautauqua 
literary and scientific circles are but voices of people crying in the wilderness 
“Make straight the way toward the people’s college and the people’s university.” 
The whole strength of this Chautauqua democracy is directed toward higher 
education for its hopeful sons and daughters. He is a superficial judge who esti- 
mates the highest educational aims of Chautauqua by those popular addresses of

Sam Jones, Sam Small, DeWitt Talmage, Joseph Cook, Edward Everett Hale, Frank 
Gunsaulus, and Phillips Brooks, to audiences of 5,000 men and women in that great 
amphitheater, although these phenomena are wonderful, moral, and quickening forces 
in themselves. Here, indeed, is a great educational folkmote; but this popular 
assembly, by its customary contributions of “ gate money,” supports that growing 
College of Liberal Arts upon the hilltop. London now boasts her People’s Palace, 
but it was not founded by, and is not supported by, the people. Chautauqua is a 
popular advance, under the leadership of two sons of the people, from a camp- 
meeting institute to a college of liberal arts, foreshadowing a people’s university. 
The American people have a sovereign instinct for good leadership, whether in educa- 
tion, religion, or politics. Robert Browning well says: 
‘Tis in the advance of individual minds 
‘That the slow crowd should ground their expectation 
Eventually to follow—as the sea 
Waits ages in its bed, till some one wave 
Out of the multitude aspires, extends 
The empire of the whole, some feet, perhaps, 
Over the strip of sand which could confine 
Its fellows so long iime; thenceforth the rest, 
Even to the meanest, hurry in at once.” 
The Chautauqua School of Theology isan outgrowth of the meetings 
of various ministers during the summer at Chautauqua Lake. It was 
duly organized and chartered in the winter of 1880-81. The objects 
of the school are thus set forth in the charter granted by the legisla- 
ture of the State of New York: 
(1) To instruct its patrons in the departments of biblical, theological, ecclesias- 
tical, historical, and philosophical learning, which are usually taught in seminaries 
devoted to the training of candidates for the clerical profession, and in such other 
subjects as in the judgment of its instructors shall conduce to the efficiency of the 
candidates. 
(2) To provide an archwological library aud museum for the illustration of bibli- 
cal and oriental research, and the collection of books, manuscripts, charts, plans, 
casts, relics, ete., designed to assist the biblical student in his investigation of the 
evidences and contents of the Holy Scriptures. 
At present there aresix departinents—New Testament Greek, Hebrew, 
doctrinal theology, practical theology, historical theology, and Chris- 
tian science. The instruction is done by correspondence, as in the 
College of Liberal Arts, and is designed to enable ministers in active 
church work to complete their professional studies. Each department 
is in charge of an instructor of reputation. In order to obtain the 
degree of B. D. the candidate must pass satisfactory personally super- 
vised examinations, and obtain a certificate from each professor. No 
honorary degrees are given. Eight degrees have been conferred, the 
average period of study being five and one-half years, nearly twice the 
seminary course. Since its beginning the school has enrolled more 
than 600 ministers of all denominations. There are at present (1892) 
150 pursuing the studies of this school. 
THE CHAUTAUQUA PRESS. 
A treatment of the various agencies by which the Chautauqua idea 
of popular education is carried out would be inadequate, were there 
no mention of the work performed by its press. From the very 
beginning Chautauqua has made use of this power, first through the 
Methodist Book Concern, the editor of whose Sunday school publica- 
tions was also Chautanqua’s superintendent of instruction, and soon 
through periodicals and books from its own presses. It was the desire 
of the management from the start to have an “organ” of its own, and 
in 1876 was commenced the publication of the Assembly Daily Herald 
as the organ of the summer meeting, and the Chautauquan, a monthly 
publication, as the organ of the literary scientific circles, and contain-
-P-A-G-E-305
    
  HISTORY OF SUMMER SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. . 935 
ing most of the required readings in serial form, and other articles of 
literary and scientifie value. 
The difficulties encountered in supplying the required books to mem- 
bers of the literary and scientific circles, soon made it necessary for 
the assembly to take the work into its own hands. The Chautauqua 
press was, therefore, established with these objects: To supervise all 
pubNeations containing required readings, or for which Chautauqua is 
is in anyway responsible in any of its departments; and to make sure 
that the books selected by the counsellors are published at low rates 
and in sufficient quantities to meet the demands of the circles. The 
list of publications from this press is already a long one, and includes 
many valuable and notable works written espevially for Chautauqua 
work. 
CHAUTAUQUA EXTENSION. 
The English idea of higher education for men and women and for life was clearly 
anticipated by Chautauqua. Some of the very features of English university 
extension characterized the educational work of Chautauqua as early as 1874. 
There were then, and in successive years, local lectures on great subjects, conversazione 
or class discussions, and written examinations upon topics of public instruction in 
Bible history and geography, normal Sunday-school work, ete. * * * Oxford and 
Cambridge borrowed the idea of summer meetings from Chautauqua in 1888, and in 
that year the first definite plan for university extension was drawn up at Chau- 
tauqua,! 
Writing further of this university extension phase of the Chautauqua 
movement, Dr. Adams says, in the Review of Reviews for July, 1891: 
Long before university extension was heard of in this country, Chautauqua began 
to feel its way towards helpful relation between college men and the people. A 
step in this direction was the establishment of the College of Liberal Arts at Chau- 
tauqua Lake, not for the purpose of giving degrees, but for the sake of bringing 
advanced students directly under the influence of college teachers engaged for the 
summer season from different institutions. In a circular of the Chautauqua College, 
published in 1883, this interesting suggestion was made: ‘One may find in almost 
every nook and corner of our land representatives of colleges, universities and pro- 
fessional schools, They constitute an unorganized brotherhood, whese friendly aid 
is gladly given to those who, less favored, seek counsel in their search for culture. 
By conversations, candid criticisms, direct assistance, they put into the student’s 
life the advantages of the teachers’ living voice and magnetic influence. A number 
of students in the same locality may organize university classes, hold frequent meet- 
ings, oceasionally employ special teachers, and thus may receive many of the benefits 
that belong to the college recitation room. Thus every student may have his 
“college council,” and most of them the “ college class.” 
Of course all such expedients are unsatisfactory without direct con- 
nection with college and university teachers, such as university exten- 
sion now supplies. Dr. Vincent, the sympathetic leader of Chautauqua, 
visited England in 1880, and again in October, 1886. He was so 
impressed with the manifest growth of the extension movement that he 
resolved to urge a similar work im eonnection with Chautauqua. He 
wrote home to the registrar of the Chautauqua College of Liberal Arts, 
and a conference was held with Dr. Harper, the principal, as early as 
November, 1886. No. practical steps were taken, however, until the 
summer of 1888, when the first definite American plan for Chautauqua 
university extension was drawn up at Chautauqua by Dr. H. B. 
Adams, with the approval of Bishop Vincent and his son and assistant, 
George E. Vincent, together with Dr. Harper, Dr. R. 'T. Ely, and Fred- 
erick Starr, who formed the principal central committee for the promo- 
tion of the new idea. 
An elaborate prospectus stating the aims, methods, cost, and history 
of university extension was issued September 15, 1888, to prominent 
     
-P-A-G-E-306
  936 ' EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
‘educators and friends of the movement. The objects proposed were: 
(1) A revival in the United States of the original idea of a university as 
a voluntary association of students and itinerant lecturers for higher 
education by means of systematic courses of local lectures upon special 
subjects; (2) the promotion of good citizenship by the popular study of 
social science, economics, history, literature, political ethics, and the 
science of government, in continuous and progressive courses, under 
the guidance of competent teachers; (3) courses of instructive lectures 
upon natural science; (4) cooperation with American colleges and other 
institutions of learning in order to supplement their work by university- 
extension courses; (5) affiliations with public libraries, mechauics’ 
institutes, lyceums, labor unions, guilds, young men’s christian asso- 
ciations, Chautauqua literary and scientific circles; (6) the higher 
education of the American people by the organization of the most intelli- 
gent and progressive local forces. 
The methods suggested were those of English university extension, 
comprising systematic lecture courses, a printed syllabus, class dis- 
cussion, written exercises, and final examination. The system was to 
be under the general management of a central committee, selected 
from representative college and university professors, who agreed, upon 
request from the Chautauqua registrar, to ‘nominate candidates for 
itinerant lectureships from among the younger specialists who are per- 
sonally known to be fitted for the task of popular teaching.” It was 
hoped that local branches of Chautauqua would prove instrumental 
in organizing local courses of extension lectures. Several editions of 
the Chautauqua circular have been published since 1888 and widely 
distributed at the summer assemblies, where thousands of people con- 
gregatein July and August to hear popular lectures and good music, 
and to attend instructive class courses at the Chautauqua College of 
Liberal Arts. Undoubtedly much of the widespread popular interest 
in university extension, particularly at the West and South, has 
resulted from this early and persistent propaganda by the managers 
of Chautauqua. The educational results are seen in the increasing 
tendency toward instructive and continuous lecture courses in the 
numerous Summer assemblies and at the central Chautauqua. These 
experiment stations might become good training schools for college 
graduates and young professors.” 
The function of Chautauqua in the educational system of the United 
States, as set forth by its promoters is compensatory and supplement- 
ary. It would not if it could supplant or compete with the institu- 
tions of the conventional type. It strives to do work which they either 
can not or have not attempted to do, and the result of the Chautauqua 
methods has been to increase the interest of the people in the college 
and university. Its underlying principle is that education is the privi- 
lege of all, young and old, rich and poor; that mental development is 
only begun in school and college, and should be continued through all 
of life. Its aim, therefore, is a double one. It would carry the benefits 
of intellectual enlightenment to those to whom circumstances have 
denied the privilege of attending the higher institutions of learning, 
and would provide for those who take the college course incentive for 
continual intellectual activity. 
Chautauqua says, therefore [writes Chancellor Vincent in his Chautauqua Move- 
ment '], show the learned their limitations and the illiterate their possibilitities. Chau- 
tauqua pleads for a universal education; for plans of reading and study; for all 
legitimate enticements and incitements to ambition; for all necessary adaptations

as to time and topics; for ideal associations which shall at once incite the imagina- 
tion and set the heart aglow. * * * Show people out of school what wonders 
people out of school may accomplish. Show people no longer young that the mind 
reaches its maturity long after the school days end, and that some of the best intel- 
lectual and literary labor is performed in and beyond middle life. 
  II—CHAUTAUQUA ASSEMBLIES. 
Chautauqua has been a prolific mother. Not the least important 
among the methods by which the extension of her influence has been 
effectuated has been the establishment.of a large number of smaller 
assemblies in various parts of the country, at which are imitated on a 
smaller scale the exercises of the parent assembly at Chautauqua Lake, 
Of such summer Chautauqua centers there now exist somewhat over 
sixty. With scarcely an exception these assemblies have been held at 
popular summer resorts, and the actual duration of the assembly ses- 
sions has.been from one to two weeks. In all cases the purpose has 
been double—primarily, instruction; secondarily, recreation. The coin- 
parative amount of emphasis laid upon these aims varies in the differ- 
ent assemblies. In some the amount of instruction given is very con- 
siderable, and covering a large number of subjects; in others the 
educational feature has been but. slightly developed. The following 
information regarding these several summer meetings has been elicited 
in response to a circular addressed to their presidents, and containing 
the following interrogatories: (1) What are the subjects taught? (2) 
What methods of instruction are followed? Do you have courses of 
lectures on large subjects, or single lectures on varying topics? (3) 
What is the size of the assembly, the number of teachers, lectures, and 
students? (4) What is the object of the assembly—instruction or 
entertainment, er both? From a few assemblies no answer has been 
obtained. 
The National Chautauqua at Glen Echo, Md.—The youngest child of 
its 17-year-old mother, Chautauqua, is the new assembly at Glen Echo, 
Md., which takes its name “ national” from its location, being situated 
but 4 miles from the national capital. 
The assembly is but one year old, its first session being held in the 
summer of 1891, but an immense amount of work has already been 
done in improving the grounds, and its first programme showed an 
excellence rivaled only by its parent at Chautauqua Lake. The indi- 
cations are, indeed, that this new educational association, incorporated 
under the laws of Maryland, will in the very near future assume a 
position in the foremost ranks of institutions for popular instruction. 
The site chosen is on the high banks of the historic Potomac, 4 miles 
above Washington, with which city it is connected by an electric car 
line. The grounds comprise about 80 acres, donated to the association - 
for the purpose, and commands an extended river front. Several 
buildings have been erected, among them the amphitheater, the Hall 
of Philosophy, the Arcade, and the Red Cross buildings. The amphi- 
theater is an immense building of granite, a perfect circle in form, and 
200 feet in diameter, and has a seating capacity of 6,000. The Hall of 
Philosophy is likewise of Potomac granite, and besides containing a 
series of rooms for special classes possesses an auditorium with seats 
for 400 people. Regarding the character of these buildings, one of the 
lecturers there last summer writes me as follows: 
The buildings which have been erected and are now in process of erection sur- 
pass by far in beauty, cost, and adaptability to their uses for which they are intended 
those of the old New York Chautauqua, and I was told by old Chautauquas, who 
have been everywhere, that they surpassed anything to be found at any Chautauqua 
in this country.
-P-A-G-E-308
  938 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
One of the most serious drawbacks to the success of the first ses- 
sion was the lack of adequate transportation facilities from Wash- 
ington. The management have, however, promised that before the 
opening of the next session a line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad 
will be running to the very gates of Glen Echo, and that a number of 
steam packets will be running on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, which 
runs through the grounds. The following account of the session of 1891 
has been kindly furnished by Dr. A. H. Gillet: 
The National Chautauqua of Glen Echo isthe corporate name of anew educational 
association formed for the purpose of conducting an annual assembly and smmmcr 
school onthe plan of the famous Chautauqua of western New York. The site selected 
is on the banks of the’ Potomac midway between Washington and _ Great Falls. 
Ample buildings have been erected at a cost of $160,000, and water supply, sewerage, 
and electric lighting provided at a cost of $100,000 more. The grounds were donated 
to the association by Messrs. Edwin and Edward Baltzley, who have also borne the 
largest share in the expense of preparing for the first session. The officers of the 
association are: President, Mr. Edwin Baltzley; chancellor, Dr. A. H. Gillet; secre- 
tary, Linson De F. Jennings; treasurer, Edward Baltzley. The location is such, the 
buildings so fine and so well adapted to the purpose, and the success of the first 
session so complete, as to raise great expectations as to the future of this admirable 
institution. 
The following is an outline of the work done during the first annual session, June 
16 to August 1, 1891. 
(1) Amphitheater entertainments.—These include lectures, stereopticon entertain- 
ments, readings, and platform meetings. Of these, 54 were given. 
(2) Concerts.—These included chorus concerts, band concerts, concerts by vocal 
and instrumental talent and piano and organ recitals; and numbered altogether 34, 
(3) Courses of lectures.—Two in literature, 1 by Mr. Leon H. Vincent, of 5 lec- 
tures, and 1 by Mr. Robert Niven, also of 5 lectures; 1 in American History by Miss 
Jane Meade Welch, of 6 lectures; 1 on political economy by Dr. W. A. Scott, of 
6 lectures; and 1 on English political leaders by Mr Robert Niven, of 3 lectures. 
(4) Studies in Shakespeare.—Miss Imogen S. Pierce conducted a class 5 hours per 
week, for 3 weeks, in the study of Shakespeare’s plays. Midsummer Night’s Dream, 
Macbeth, and the Merchant of Venice are the plays through which the class went 
with some degree of thoroughness. 
(5) Biblical literature.—In this department, during the first3 weeks of the assembly 
session, classes were taught in Hebrew and New Testament Greek. Two courses of 
lectures were delivered, 1 on Old Testament history by Prof. George S. Goodspeed, 
and 1 on the gospel of John by Dr. F. K. Sanders. Supplemental to this work Dr. 
George Elliott, of Washington, delivered 6 lectures on Biblical subjects and 7 on 
normal methods as applied to Sunday-school and church work. 
(6) The schools.—Practical class work has been successfully conducted in the 
industrial-art department by Prof. J. Liberty Tadd; in the various departments of 
business by Prof. and Mrs. 8. H. Spencer; in French and Italian by Prof. J. P. des 
Garrennes; in Latin and mathematics by Prof. F. A. Springer; in musie by Prof. 
Mark C. Baker; in Delsarte by Miss Gwyneth D. King; and in physical training by 
Prof. J. W. Sims. 
(7) ‘Other work.—In addition to what is enumerated above, special attention was 
given to young people’s work. Mr. W. H. H. Smith concluded a series of very help- 
ful meetings, spending a part of each hour in devotional service and the remainder 
in the study of the best methods of doing such work. 
(8) €. L. 8. C.—Round tables were held as often as circumstances would permit, 
and a recognition service was conducted at which 11 people were “recognized,” 6 
receiving their diplomas. An ‘‘office” waskept open. Circulars, blank forms of 
application, and copies of the Chautauquan were distributed. 
(9) Sunday services.—Among the most pleasant memories of the first session of 
the Glen Echo Chautauqua will be the restful Sabbath hours, able and thoughtful 
sermons, inspiring music and the devotional spirit, ministered to by all of the asso- 
ciations of the day and place. The Sunday school for the study of the Word and the 
Chantauqua Sunday vesper services both contributed much to the value of these 
days of rest. 
In the work of this first session the association has had in its employ for the 
entertainment and instruction of the public 304 musicians, besides the registered cho- 
tus of 900 singers, 60 lecturers and readers, and 17 teachers, making a total 
of 441 different people who in one way or another have contributed to the success 
of the first programme of the Glen Echo Chautauqua, 
Plans are already maturing for the work of the Glen Echo Chantauqua for 1892. 
An elaborate programme will be provided covering the various lines of summer-school

work. The ablest teachers to be had will be chosen and nothing omitted to make 
it the equal of any similar institution in the quality and character of its work, as 
it is now the best equipped with buildings and facilities. 
Acton Park, Indiana.—The annual session of Acton Park Assembly 
for 1891 opened July 22 and closed August 10. Properly speaking, 
the yearly gatherings at this place have been of a camp-meeting char 
acter for religious purposes, but from year to year days have been set 
apart for Chautauqua work. - Lectures upon various topics have been- 
delivered, classes organized for study, and diplomas delivered to grad- 
uates. 
Bay View, Mich—Bay View is in northern Michigan, on Little 
Traverse Bay, out of Lake Michigan, and a mile above the city of 
Petoskey. Itis entirely a summer city of 400 or more cottages and 
hotels, besides 7 halls of the Bay View Summer University. 
In 1876 Bay View was founded, and in 1886 the assembly and sum- 
mer university were organized. In the assembly instruction is the 
principal object, though entertainment is also used to interest. The 
_general programme is itself a popular school, and courses of lectures 
on large subjects are a prominent feature. Lectures for entertainment 
are used sparingly. Besides the general programme there are several 
departments, notably the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union School 
of Methods and the Bay View. Missionary Institute, each holding 
almost daily sessions, where by lecture and exposition leaders instruct 
workers and members in these organizations. These departments are 
believed to be of great practical value. In addition the Women’s Coun- 
cil, the Press Club, and a series.of meetings conducted by the Young 
People’s Society of Christian Endeavor and the Epworth League consti- 
tute popular schools where ideas are exchanged and leaders with ideals 
and ideas.are heard in programmes specially arranged to arouse and 
instruct. The university has nine departments: college of liberal arts, 
Bible school, school of art, schoolof music, schools of elocution, physical 
culture, photography, business, ete. The faculty numbers 32, includ- 
ing instructors, and the attendance is between 400 and 500. The 
methods of instruction are mainly by lecture and practical work. The 
subjects taught are those usually included in the schools named. The 
attendance at the assembly is about 12,000 during the season. The uni- 
versity term is usually’ from the middle of July to the middle of 
August, and the assembly session begins one week later than the for- 
mer, closing with it. The announcements for the session of 1892 con- 
tain the information of the acceptance of the principalship of the univer- 
sity by Dr. Richard T. Ely, late of the Johns Hopkins University, at 
present professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin. The 
department of social science is to be further strengthened by the 
coming of Prof. David Kinley. Among other new men secured by the 
Bay View Assembly are Prof. James A. Woodburn, of the University 
of Indiana, who will conduct courses in American history, and Prof. 
H. M. Magoun, whose work will be in the classes. 
In connection with the Bay View Assembly is published a quarterly 
magazine entitled, The Bay View Assembly Herald. 
Beatrice, Nebr., and Mountain Lake Park, Md.—These two assemblies 
are under the same management. Concerning them Mr. W. L. David- 
son, D. D., the superintendent of instruction, gives the following facts: 
The subjects taught are Sunday-school normal classes in senior and 
junior grades, elocution, kindergarten, physical culture, modern lan- 
guages, astronomy, art, microscopy, music, and’ ministers’ institute (ten 
days’ session with lectures along Biblical lines), The instruction is by  
-P-A-G-E-310
  940 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
daily classes, courses of lectures on large subjects, and often single 
lectures on varying topics. Over 25,000 people visited the Beatrice 
Assembly during the last session, and over twice that number the 
assembly at Mountain Lake Park. Classes have averaged from 25 to 
100 students. 
Black Hills, South Dakota.—Yhe Black Hills Chautauqua Assembly 
gives instruction in the Bible, music, natural sciences, history, and litera- 
ture. About one-halfof the time allotted to lecturesis devoted to courses 
of lectures on large subjects, the other half to single lectures on varying 
topics. At the last session there were 6 teachers, 12 lecturers, and 
about 150 students. The session lasted from August 11 to August 26. 
The town of Black Hills is built around the famous Hot Springs of 
South Dakota, the curative powers of whose waters attract a yearly 
gathering of 10,000 people. 
Bluff Park, lowa.—The assembly at this place has not been organized 
into a school, with its classes and corps of teachers, nor is there a 
record of attendance kept. General instruction, however, on biblical 
subjects, is given daily, and there are occasional lectures on varying 
topics. 
Ohester, Iil.—The Southern Illinois Chautauqua at Chester held its 
first session in 1891, and is the first one ever conducted by a woman. 
The opening session was successful, several schools were formally 
begun, and the attendance increased from 500 at the beginning to 
nearly 1,200 on the closing night. 
Immediately at the close of the assembly a charter was applied for 
and preliminaries of permanent organization effected. 
Clarion, Pa.—The subjects taught at this assembly, held at Reynolds- 
ville, Pa., are English branches, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and German. 
There is also an Itinerant’s Club department, a Chautauqua Literary 
and Scientific Circle, and a Chautauqua Normal Union department. 
The instruction is by classes and single lectures on varying topics. The 
attendance of students has been about 100 and the corps of teachers 
has averaged 10. The object of the assembly has been, primarily, 
instruction. 
Connecticut Valley, Northampton, Mass.—The fifth session of the Con- 
necticut Valley Sunday School and Chautauqua Assembly was held in 
1891 at Laurel Park. The subjects systematically taught were music, 
elocution, primary, intermediate, and normal work in Bible teaching. 
In the subjects named there were special instructors. The work of 
these teachers was supplemented by single lectures on many subjects. 
The instructors numbered 6, the lecturers 27, and there were 100 stu- 
dents enrollea. The attendance at the lectures reached as high as 
2,000 in some cases. 
Council Bluffs and Omaha Assembly.—The subjects taught are: Music, 
Bible, and pedagogics in classes, and « wide variety of other subjects in 
popular lectures. At the last session a special course on literature and 
comparative religions was given on the university extension plan. The 
attendance at the session of 1891 was 5,000 at the lectures, and from 20 
to 150 in each of the classes. There were 8 teachers and 20 lecturers. 
East Epping, N. H.—For six years a Chautauqua assembly has been 
held at East Epping. At the last session instruction was given in 
French, German, vocal music, water color and oil and china painting, 
shorthand, and typewriting. There were Sunday school normal and 
children’s Bible classes, and lectures, concerts, and religious meetings 
every evening. x 
Epworth Heights Assembly, Ohio.—Subjects taught: Music, elocution, 
fine arts, painting, china decoration, etc., stenography, typewriting.
-P-A-G-E-311

photography, cookery, physical culture, Sunday-school normal studies. 
ethods of instruction: By class work and lectures. Attendance: 
From 2,000 to 3,000; 20 teachers and 150 students. 
Florida Chantanqua. —The Florida Chautauqua is situated at De 
Funiak Springs, Walton County, and is one of the most successful of 
these institutions organized on the plan of the parent assembly in New 
York. The subjects taught in classes are: The Bible, arts, music, kin- 
dergarten, pedagogy, elocution, physical culture, and stenography. 
During each session there are given several courses of lectures on 
literary and social topics. The programme for 1891 shows, for example, 
that a course of 6 lectures on “Labor and property” was given 
by Dr. Washington Gladden, and another course of 4 lectures on 
“Astronomy” by Prof. H. N. Felkel. At these lectures the university 
extension plan was followed of distributing to the audience printed 
outlines, and closing with a written examination. Besides these 
courses there were a large number of single lectures on different sub- 
jects. At the session of 1891 there were 12 nes 40 lecturers, and 
an attendance of 4,000. 
Fremont, Nebr. —The Central Chautauqua Adcabily, at Fremont, 
Nebr., held its first session June 23 to July 6, 1891. 
Permanent improvements consisting of an. auditorium with a seating 
capacity of 3,000, 12 other buildings, and a hotel have been made. 
The general work of the assembly for its first year consisted of 47 lec- 
tures and addresses; 40 hours of normal work, 40 hours given to the 
Teacher’s Retreat; 17 hours to chorus work; 10 hours to Young Peo- 
ple’s conference,* besides the regular work of the Round Table held 
each day and a W. C. T. U. School of Methods. 
Georgetown, Tex.—The first session of this assembly was held in 
1891, and had sufficient success to place it beyond the experimental 
stage. The assembly session lasted from July 1 to July 15. 
Georgia Chatauqua.—This assembly held at Albany, Ga., confines 
its instruction to the departments of music, physical training and com- 
mercial law and bookkeeping, in which the enrollment of students has 
averaged 600 yearly. 
Hedding Chautauqua, New Hampshire-——The Hedding Assembly is 
auxiliary to the Chautauqua University at East Epping. The sub- 
jects taught are French, German, voice culture, oil painting, and crayon 
work, shorthand and typewriting, cooking, Sunday-school normal work, 
and juvenile science. These subjects are taught in classes, and there 
are occasional lectures. The number of teachers at the session of 1890 
was 10. There were 45 lectures given and an enrollment of over 200 
paying students. Those in attendance upon the lectures averaged 800 
in number. 
Colfax, Iowa.—The Iowa Chautauqua Assembly at Colfax held its 
third session in 1891. The subjects that have been taught are, Evi- 
dences of Christianity, music, political economy, physical culture, history, 
biography, science, literature, art, and ethics. Instruction has been 
by class work, and by lecture courses on large topics and separate 
addresses on varying subjects. At the last session there was an aver- 
age of 4 lectures or entertainments per day for ten days. 
Island Park, Indiana.—The Island Park Chautauqua held its thir- 
teenth session in 1891. There were 12 organized classes. Instruction 
was given in the following subjects: Fine arts, languages, English lit- 
erature, elocution, physical culture, kindergarten, and normal classes. 
Numerous lectures on various subjects were given by prominent men. 
The average daily attendance in the auditorium was 2,000.

Kansas Chautauqua.—The Kansas Chautauqua Assembly has met 
each summer at Oakland Park; near Topeka, for seven years, holding 
annually a 10-days’ session, with normal classes for study of the English 
Bible, training classes for instructing Sunday-school teachersin approved 
methods of teaching; classes—part of the time—in elementary Greek 
and Hebrew, in elocution and literature, with lectures on popular sub- 
jects, intended for entertainment as well as instruction; stereopticon 
tours, concerts, classes in music, etc. Missionary conventions and. 
councils of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union have also-been 
held sometimes in connection with the assembly. The instruction has 
been done chiefly by lecture-lessons, with blackboard outlines. The 
normal classes have brought together about 200 students; the popular 
lectures have been attended by audiences which sometimes reached the 
number of 3,500. The present corps of instructors numbers 12, 
Kentucky Assembly.—The Kentucky Chautauqua Assembly has been 
in existence for five years. Instruction is given in Bible studies, nor- 
mal training, W. C. T.U. work, and music. “We have as yet only 
begun our educational work,” writes the superintendent, “but our 
design is to begin to develop this work, especially in the line of uni- 
versity extension courses. We had an audience last year of 20,000 
people. The number of lecturers, teachers, and workers was 30. 
Ottawa Chautauqua Assembly.—Regarding the work of these three 
assemblies, their superintendent, Dr. J. L. Hurlbut, writes the follow- 
ing letter: 
Lhave charge of the above assemblies and allof them are conducted substantially 
upon the same plan. I 
At each assembly we hold daily classes, at least 2 hours a day, for the study of 
the Bible and the best methods of Sunday-school work. We have also children’s 
classes for Bible study, and an examination upon it at the close of the session. We 
have a chorus organized consisting of from 100 to 300 singers, which receive train- 
ing from 2 to 4 hours every day. We have also a class at most of the assemblies 
named above of from 100 to 200 members in English literature. 
The afternoon and evening platform exercises are of a popular character intended 
to draw the crowds, but literary lectures we find are the most popular. Three 
thousand or 4,000 listened to each of Gunsaullus’s historical lectures last summer. 
The Ottawa Assembly last summer had over 2,000 people attending its daily 
classes, with about 10 instructors, and the lecture platform embraced about 10 lee- 
turers. 
The Nebraska Assembly had, perhaps, 1,000 attending its several 
classes, with half as many instructors as at Ottawa. 
Lake Tahoe, California.—The Lake Tahoe Assembly is a new enter- 
prise, and but two sessions have been held. As thus far developed, 
there are schools of history, language, natural history, and theological 
department of methods. At the session of 1890 there were 10 lecturers, 
6 teachers, and 150 students. 
Lakeside Assembly, Ohio.—The following letter from the secretary 
explains the character of the work of this assembly: 
There is taught the ‘‘Bible normal course,” science, art, literature, temperance, 
political economy, history, biography, and every subject that comes in the line of 
popular lecture courses. We have kindergarten and normal schools, music, and 
elocution, 
We have both “ courses of lectures on large subjects and single lectures on vary- 
ing topics.” 
The average attendance at lectures is probably 1,500 at the three popular hours— 
10 a.m., 2.30 p.m., and 8 p,m.; at the odd hours, of course a much less number. In 
the special classes say, an average of 20. 
Our object is to instruct and entertain as well as furnish a healthful resort. Our 
camp meeting, held at consecutive date, is under the management of a board of trus- 
tees, appointed by five conferences of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and is as 
well attended as the other.

HISTORY OF SUMMER SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 943° 
Long Beach, Cal.—Long Beach Chautauqua Assembly, held at one 
of the summer resorts on the Pacific coast, has afforded instruction in 
Sunday school normal work, art, cookery, oratory, music, photography, 
and kindergarten. In addition, there have been numerous lectures. 
For four years, also, the Epworth League Assembly has held its annual 
camp meeting in connection with the assembly, and under its auspices 
has been conducted a school for the study of the English Bible. Ses- 
sions of the Southern California W. C. T. U. Assembly and School of 
Methods have also been held at Long Beach. 
Long Pine, Nebr.—The assembly at Long Pine teaches the Bible, 
political science, natural science, temperance, pedagogy, and music, 
with the C. L. S. C. a specialty. Lectures are given on various sub- 
jects, and there is daily class instruction. There are from 10 to 12 
teachers and 18 or 20 lecturers employed at each session. The stu- 
dents number from 200 to 300, and the attendance ranges from 500 to 
2,000, 
” Monona Lake, Wisconsin.—The instruction at this assembly embraces 
the following subjects: The Bible, pedagogics, vocal music, and eloeu- 
tion, This work is supplemented by lectures, both single and in courses. 
The daily attendance has been from 1,500 to 6,000. Five teachers have 
been employed, the number of lectures has averaged 40, and the attend- 
ance of students over 400. 
Mont Eagle, Tenn.—The following letter of the superintendent gives 
an outline of the work of this assembly: 
Our assembly embraces two features—the schools and assembly platform. In the 
schools taught the branches needed by teachers of the various schools in the 
South, embracing ancient and modern languages, English, mathematics, sciences, 
pedagogics, music, and art. 
Both methods are used. Single lectures, course lectures, and class instruction are 
used. 
* “The assembly and schools run through two months; more than 60 lecturers and 
teachers were employed last year, and the average daily attendance 800 to 1,000 per- 
18. 
On rhe object is to entertain and instruct, furnishing instruction on the leading reli- 
gions and popular topics of the day. 
Northern New England, Maine —The cisteacetn at this assembly, 
which holds its annual sessions at Fryeburg, is given almost exclu- 
sively by means of lectures of which there are a considerable number. 
  Systematic instruction, however, is given in oratory, Delsarte sciences, 
normal methods, and cookery. 
Ocean City, N. J—Concerning the work of this assembly its presi- 
dent writes as follows: 
We do not make it a business to form classes and go through professional instruc- 
tions. We have exercises of a religious character; C. L. S.C. round tables; recog- 
nition day, when we give the C. L. 8.C. diplomas sent tons from Dr, Vincent to those 
who have earned them; lectures, camp-fire services, and other services pertaining to 
Chautauqua work. Our lectures are on single subj Our audiences vary from 
100 to 300 on week days to 500 on Sundays. Our object is to entertain along educa- 
tional lines and to stir up interest in Chautauqua educational methods for those who 
can not go to regular schools. 
Piasa Bluffs, [Uinois.—The subjoined letter sufficiently describes the 
work of this assembly: 
Our programmes have been general, but we have so far given most attention to 
Sunday-school normal work, and to the Chautauqua literary and scientific circle. 
Our methods have been the normal drills, round-table conversation, and lectures. 
So far we have had only single lectures on varying topics. 
‘The attendance varies. from 150 to 1,000. There have been but 2 regular teachers, 
Rey. C. J. W. Coxe, D. D., in charge of the normal work, and myself [Rev. Frank 
Lenig, pu. D.] in charge of the C. L. S. C. work. Last year there were about 40 in 
the normal class, and about 25 Chautauquans.

  944. EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
We propose both instruction and entertainment. The assembly is only about 
three years old, but its prospects are good. New departments will be added this 
year, and a week will probably be given to an itinerant club. 
Piedmont Chautauqua, Georgia.—The Piedmont Chautauqua, which 
holds its session at New Atlanta, rests upon a substantial basis, hav- 
ing over $100,000 invested in buildings and park. The subjects taught 
are language (German, French, and English), English literature, gen- 
eral history, pedagogy, physics, biology, botany, mineralogy, vocal 
and instrumental music, art, physical culture, elocution, business, and 
kindergarten. The methods of instruction include class work, conver- 
sational lectures, and lecture courses on such large subjects as English 
literature, Egyptology, and the Bible. The number of teachers has 
averaged 20, the lecturers 40, and the audiences have ranged as high as 
3,000. Dee : : : Riverview, Ohio.—The Riverview Assembly has held three summer 
sessions at New Richmond, Ohio. The first season a full course of 
studies was conducted, but since then instruction has been limited to 
single lectureson detached subjects. Audiences have ranged from 1,000 
to 2,000. 
Rocky Mountain, Colorado.—The following letter gives the essential 
points regarding this assembly: 
The Rocky Mountain Chautauqua Assembly, held at Glen Park, near Palmer Lake, 
Colo., is a summer school, which continues about three weeks each summer, begin- 
ning the second Wednesday in July. 
The subjects taught are: (a) Lessons on the construction, origin, evidences, his- 
tory, geography, institutions, and interpretation of Scriptures, and upon the organ- 
ization, management, and teaching in Sunday schools; (b) Popular course of 
instruction in botany, geology, astronomy, and such history as may be in current 
line of C.L.S.C. reading; (c) Round table, taking up such subjects as are being 
or have recently been considered in the C. 1s 8: readings. 
We adopt, as methods of instruction, lectures and examinations, and in the normal 
department a course of study and recitation. We also have a course of platform 
lectures of popular character on all subjects that the lecturers may select from. 
The number of teachers and lecturers at each assembly will probably average 
about 30. Enrolled students average, say, 100, but of those in attendance, 1,500. 
Our assembly is principally for instruction, "put we combine with it entertain- 
ment. 
San Marcos, Tex.—Instruction at the San Mareos Assembly includes, 
(1) the course of study prescribed for the C.L. 8. C.; (2) in its teachers’ 
summer normal institute, the course of study prescribed for the pub- 
lic free schools of Texas. There are both courses of lectures on large 
subjects and course lectures and illustrations on select and varying 
subjects and class work. There are also Sunday school normal lectures 
and class work. Elocution, various branches of art, kindergarten are 
also taught. The membership of the institution is about 200, and the 
teachers at the session of 1891 numbered 13 and the lecturers 22. The 
object of the assembly is, first, moral and religious instruction; sec- 
ond, social entertainment. At session of 1891 the assembly more than 
cleared expenses, besides raising $1,250 for a hall of philosophy. 
Silver Lake, N. Y.—The subjects taught are theology, conference stud- 
ies for young men entering the ministry, normal Biblical studies, 
school of English Bible, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, French, German, Eng- 
lish literature, oratory, stenography, typewriting, and music. The- 
ology, conference studies, and English Bible are taught in lectures, 
the others in schools. The “natural method” is employed in the 
languages. The regular teachers number 12, the lecturers about 15, and 
in all departments there are enrolled 400 students. 
San Antonio, Tex.—The subjects embraced in the instruction given 
at the Texas Chautauqua at San Antonio are the Bible, music, elocu-

tion, Sunday school normal training, secular normal school, and the C, 
L.8.C course. The lectures are usually on various detached sub- 
jects, though occasionally longer courses on large subjects are given. 
The teaching force has averaged from 12 to 15, with as many lecturers 
in addition. 
Waseca Assembly, Minnesota—This assembly dates from 1884, and 
during the eight years of its existence has had remarkable success. A 
full equipment of buildings and facilities for every kind of assembly 
work have been provided. An auditorium tabernacle, hall of philoso- 
phy, and normal hall have been erected. The assembly now includes 
9 general departments and more than 20 special classes. The subjects 
taughtare: Music, French, German, shorthand, botany, biology, astron- 
omy, microscopy, history, crayon work, bookkeeping, and typewriting, 
Sunday-school normal work, pedagogies, and theology. 
Waseca Assembly is the northwestern headquarters for the C. L. 8. 
C., and special attention is paid to C. L. S.C. work. Besides these 
branches of work there are an Itinerants’ Club of the Minnesota 
Annual Conference, and an Epworth League Training Institute. 
Wiers, N. H.—Regarding the Winnipesaukee Lake Assembly, which 
has held five annual sessions at Wiers, N. H., the president writes as 
follows: 
The subjects taught are those treated in the C. L. 8. C. work, the Bible, and music. 
We have both courses of lectures and single lectures on varying topics. The aver- 
age attendance of members may be put at 300, but the visitors are many more. The 
average of lecturers and teachers may be put at 12. Our main purpose is instruc- 
tion, but we give entertainments also. 
Concerning the following assemblies no information has been obtained: 
Lake Bluff Assembly, Illinois; Lake Madison, South Dakota; Lang- 
don Assembly, North Dakota; Hiram Assembly, Ohio; Missouri 
Assembly, Warrensburg, Mo.; Mountain Grove, Berwick, Pa.; Niagara

UI.—THE MARTHA’S VINEYARD SUMMER INSTITUTE. 
The summer institute that has been held on Martha’s Vineyard since 
the summer of 1878 is to-day one of the leading and most flourishing 
institutes for summer instruction in the United States. Together with 
the great experiment at Chautauqua Lake, it occupies a position in 
modern educational movements that will render a detailed description 
of its work the best commentary that can be given upon that phase of 
popular instruction, which it is the purpose of this monograph to 
describe. 
The following account of this institution has been adopted from a 
sketch very kindly furnished by its present president, William A. 
Mowry, PH. D. 
The school was started in the summer of 1878, The originator and 
first president of the enterprise was Col. Homer B. Sprague, PH. D., 
at that time the head master of the girls’ high school in Boston. He 
first selected the place, interested others in the scheme, put the plan in

operation, and carried the institution forward until it was incorporated 
under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and became one 
of the permanent educational institutions of the Old Bay State, and 
secured a fine building adequate for the purpose, where sixteen recita- 
tions could be conducted in the same hour. Dr. Sprague himself thus 
describes the beginning and first few years of the school:' 
The Martha’s Vineyard Summer Institute originated in avery humble way. For 
a number of years, beginning with 1871, my friend Prof. Ellinwood and myself had 
, spent the greater part of the summer at the Vineyard, and we had often discussed 
the possibility of establishing a summer school on the island. There was no ques- 
tion in our minds as to the desirability of well-directed mental employment on the 
part of thousands of teachers and others, during a portion of the two or three 
months of the long vacation. What to do, and how to do it, in founding such an 
institution, was the problem. To us, after much meditating, it seemed best, at last, 
to invite a number of eminent teachers to join us in issuing an announcement of 
classes, to be formed at Cottage City (then Vineyard Grove), in July, 1878, and to 
be continued five weeks. If successful, the work could be repeated in future years, 
and possibly a large and permanent institution might grow out of it. If unsuccess- 
ful, no serious harm was anticipated, and it would be gratifying to have deserved 
to succeed. No large pecuniary return was looked for; but it was hoped that scores 
and hundreds of students would be materially aided, and that valuable service 
would be rendered to the cause of education. The healthfulness of the island, its 
quiet beauty, its accessibility yet seclusion, its facilities for bathing, its innocent 
recreations, and especially its traditionally religious character and its wholesome 
moral influences seemed to make it of all spots the fittest for such an enterprise. 
The plan adopted allowed of indefinite expansion. Any study in which satisfac- 
tory work can be done, or even a satisfactory beginning can be made, or asatisfactory 
course of lectures or lessons given, during five weeks, might be admitted, provided a 
competent professor could he found to take charge of the special branch. Each pro- 
fessor was to have complete liberty to manage his department in his own way so far 
asit could be done without injury to his associate professors or to the general inter- 
ests of the institute. A uniform rate of tuition, $15 in each department, was fixed 
upon, and each professor was to receive as compensation for his services the tuition 
fees paid by his own students. The professors were to share equally the expense of 
advertising by joint circulars and by joint cards in the newspapers, but each profes- 
sor was at liberty to advertise further his special classes. The common interests of 
the institute were to be managed by the professors assembled as a faculty of instruc- 
tion and government or by the president acting for all. 
As bonds of union among the students as well as among the professors, all mem- 
bers of classes and of professors’ families were to be admitted free of cost to public 
lectures and entertainments by distinguished men invited by the institute. These 
were to be paid by admission fees from all persons not connected with the school. 
The professors also were at liberty to deliver public lectures, receiving as their com- 
pensation the proceeds of tickets sold to persons not members. 
For such lectures, readings, or concerts the institute was to provide a hall and pay 
the expense of tickets and handbills, but the lecturer or other performer was to be 
at his own charges and his own risk as to receipts. The giver of the entertainment 
was at liberty, under proper limitations, in his discretion and at his own expense, to 
resort to other means of advertisement. 
Further to unite the members of the institute and promote social enjoyment, 
weekly receptions and excursions were arranged, the former taking place on Friday 
evenings and the latter on Saturdays. 
The general plan of operations, allowing to each department independence in all 
local matters not affecting immediately the common interests, yet combining for cen- 
tral direction in all things in which the general welfare of the institute is concerned, 
has prevailed until the present time. The forenoons are mostly given up to class ex- 
ercises, the afternoons and evenings to public lectures and entertainments, Friday 
evenings to receptions, and the whole of Saturdays to excursions and recreation. 
The election by a student of two or more studies has been permitted but not 
encouraged. When interferences have occurred between hours of recitation, the 
same student being due at two places at once, the matter has been amicably arranged 
by the professors in charge of those classes, or, in case of irreconcilable diversity 
of opinion, by the president of the institute. 
In the fall of 1877 and winter of 1877~78, after much consideration, and after con- 
sultation with many eminent gentlemen, the following instructors were induced to 
join in the work:

Cambridge, and Dr. Paulus Reinsch, of Munich; in. pedagogies, Prof. J. C, 
Greenough, of State Normal School, Providence, R. I.; in zoology, Profs. William B. 
Dwight,.of Vassar College, and A. C. Apgar, of the State Normal School at Trenton, 
N. J. 
After several unsuccessful attempts to secure a desirable professor to take charge 
of elocution, that department, as well as English literature, was placed under my 
own care. A public meeting was held in the Union Chapel the day before the 
beginning of the session, and the different professors successively stated to the audi- 
ence the course in their several studies. Mrs. Abba Gould Woolson was engaged to 
deliver a course of 10 public lectures on historical and literary subjects, and Prof. 
Robert R. Raymond gave 10 public Shakespearian readings. Mrs. Woolson was 
prevented by ill health from fulfilling her appointments. Mr. Tetlow delivered two 
public lectures on Latin pronunciation, afterwards printed in the N, E. Journal of 
Education; Mr. William Marshall, 1 on an “An evening in wonderland;” Mr. 
Apgar, 2 on ‘‘Lifein thesea;” Mr. Dudley, 1 on botany; Mr. Putnam, 4on “Keramics 
and the potter’s wheel;” Mr. Mann, 1 on insects, and Mr. Sprague, 4 on Shakespeare, 
Milton, and Goldsmith. 
Of the departments just mentioned, that of entomology was not begun, Mr. 
Mann, the professor in charge, having married just four days before the institute 
opened; that of microscopy (or micrology, as the professor preferred to style it), 
which was to have been located at West Falmouth, was discontinued by reason of 
the nonarrival of students till after the departure of Dr. Reinsch; and that of peda- 
ogics or didactics, which, owing to the modesty of Mr. Greenough, had been much 
ess advertised than the rest,was also suspended, The other departments continued 
in successful operation till the close of the session. About 80 students were reg- 
istered during the first summer, that of 1878. 
Atthe close of the first session a strong feeling of satisfaction at the degree of 
success attained under unfavorable circumstances was generally manifest, and found 
expression in earnest resolutions unanimously adopted at a large meeting of the 
students. At the annual meeting of the faculty in August, Messrs. Sprague, Ellin- 
wood, and Putnam were severally elected president, treasurer, and secretary, and it 
was resolved to hold another session in the following summer. 
The attendance at the second session was about double that of the first year. Bot- 
any, English literature, geology, and mineralogy, French, German, industrial draw- 
ing, Latin and Greek, phonography, and zoology were taught by the same instructors, 
respectively, as during the first session. A department of history was added under 
the care of Prof. H. 8. Mackintosh. 
The third session, that of 1880, saw many changes in the faculty. A department 
of music was established. Astronomy and didactics were also added: to the list of 
courses. The attendance was smaller in numbers, but, perhaps, of a higher average 
quality than the preceding year. > 
The fourth annual session, that of 1881, witnessed other changes in the faculty, 
and several new studies were added, namely, Anglo-Saxon, paleontology, and micro- 
scopy. Numerous public lectures also were given. The opinion was quite generally 
expressed that, on the whole, this fourth session of the institute had been the most 
interesting and profitable since the foundation. 
But the inconveniences to which we were subjected by the lack of an institute 
building, though reduced to a minimum by the generous hospitality of the people of 
Cottage City, seemed from the outset to threaten the prosperity, if not the existence, 
of the school. Efforts had been unceasingly put forward to secure permanent quar- 
ters for the classes, a permanent home for the organization. One after another 
promising plans failed. Some discouragement was natural after these repeated fail- 
ures, and one professor seriously proposed to his associates to remove the school to 
Plymouth, Mass.; to abandon it was not to be thought of. But among all our dis- 
appointments we had always one resource to fall back upon. We knew that from 
year to year there had been in the minds of the residents and visitors at the Vine- 
yard a growing sense of the importance of the institute, and that its permanent 
establishment by their voluntary contributions, if in no other way, was but a ques- 
tion of time. Happily, one of our number, Mr. Putnam, had the leisure, the dispo- 
sition, and the ability to give his energies to the important work of soliciting sub- 
scriptions. Other professors aided. The results were most gratifying. Within two 
weeks about $3,000 had been subscribed by about 120 donors. It remained to become 
a corporation under the laws of Massachusetts, with power to hold property. A 
meeting of directors for that purpose was held about the Ist of September, 1885, 
and the proper officers were elected. 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
  948 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
The above sketch by Col. Sprague (continues Dr. Mowry) leaves us 
in the spring of 1882, at the time of his resignation of the office of presi- 
dent. Prof. William J. Rolfe, Lit. D., the well-known Shakespearian 
eritic and writer upon English literature, was unanimously chosen presi- 
dent. He served the institute six years, from 1882 to 1887, inclusive. 
The building of a large, commodious, and substantial edifice for the 
exclusive use of the institute was a great work. The heavy burden of 
this enterprise fell upon Prof. Benjamin W. Putnam, who for many 
years was the clerk and general business manager. 
In the New England Magazine for July, 1887, the leading article is 
entitled “The Martha’s Vineyard Summer Institute.” This article is 
believed to be largely from Mr. Putnam’s pen, and that portion which 
relates to the years 1882 to 1887, inclusive, is here reproduced: 
On the 13th of February, 1882, Col. Sprague tendered his resignation as president, 
impelled thereto by ‘ill health and apress of other duties.” As he made this posi- 
tive, the directors were compelled to accept it. Prof. William J. Rolfe, the vice- 
president, was unanimously elected to fill the vacancy. Of him the retiring presi- 
dent said to the directors: ‘You are fortunate, indeed, to secure the services of one 
who has achieved success in both science and literature; one whose fame, through 
his works, is not only national, but international.” 
The erection of a spacious and convenient building on a cool and commandin, 
site gave a new impetus to the good work, which was apparent in the inievened 
attendance at the opening of the session of 1882. The building was dedicated with 
appropriate services, the former president, Col. Sprague, delivering the dedicatory 
address. 
The comfort of the new building, with the various appliances of a schoolhouse, 
was fully appreciated by those who, for four years, had struggled on without them. 
One large room is made extensively useful as a reception room, where students can 
meet for social intercourse, to read and write; where, also, are displayed on shelves 
the various new text-books of the year, sent by the publishers for examination; and 
where ail other necessary school supplies are kept for sale. 
In 1882 the directors decided to publish a paper, which was issued under the name 
of the ‘(Institute Herald.” This paper, under the energetic management of Dr. Wil- 
liam F. Morrison, of Providence, son of the treasurer, was a success, and aided in 
making the institute better known, not only in the immediate vicinity, but through- 
out the country. 
During this session, the department of history was most ably conducted by Dr. 
Charles K. Adams, now president of Cornell University. Dr. W. A. Brownell, of 
Syracuse, took charge of the department of mineralogy and has continued to fill that 
chair most acceptably to the present date. The German department was in charge 
of Prof. Hermann B. Boisen, author of some valuable text-books. The Shakespearian 
readings of Prof. R. R. Raymond had become very popular, and large audiences 
gathered to enjoy his renderings of the plays of the great poet. The course of 
geological lectures, by Dr. Alexander Winchell, was enjoyed by throngs of delighted 
listeners. 
The season of 1883 was one of continued prosperity for the institute. The erection 
of two buildings for the accommodation of the musical department, marked the out- 
ward growth, and relieved the already crowded rooms of the main building by fur- 
nishing accommodations for the large class in vocal music, under Prof. Daniell, and 
that in the pianoforte, under Prof. Howard. 
The department of didactics was, during the sessions of 1882 and 1883, in charge 
of Col. F. W. Parker, at that time one of the supervisors of the Boston schools. In 
the year 1883 a fair in aid of the institute was held in Agassiz Hall, under the charge 
of the wives of the professors, and a considerable sum of money was raised to meet 
obligations that had been incurred in the furnishing of the building. Another fair 
was held in the Union Chapel the following year, but a severe storm and other 
causes combined to make it much less successful than the first. 
This year the department of pedagogy was in charge of Prof. H. H. Straight, of the 
Cook County Normal School, Chicago, I]. 
The department of philosophy was in charge of F. Louis Soldan, principal of the 
St. Louis Normal School, with Dr. William T. Harris of Concord, as lecturer. The 
department of physical culture was conducted by Dr. Dio Lewis, of New York. ~ 
The most noticeable improvement in what may be termed the plant of the institute 
this year was the erection of a building for a café, where the students who are 
obliged to lodge at some distance can take their meals with convenience. This plan 
is found to be both economical, affording board at a lower rate, and advantageous

also in a social way, bringing the students more together and promoting good feel- 
ing and a fraternal spirit. 
The ninth year (1886) saw but few changes in the faculty, the most noticeable 
being that in the chair of elocution, which was filled by Dr. S. 8. Curry, dean of 
the Boston School of Expression, who endeared himself to those under his immedi- 
ate charge to a remarkable degree. 
We may add, in a general way, that each year, profiting by the experience of the 
past, the directors have been able so to systematize matters that work can be begun 
the first day of the session and continue uninterruptedly till the close, which, by a 
recent vote, may not be till the sixth week. It is proper also to state that, as this 
is a school established primarily for teachers, the members of the faculty take 
especial pains to teach methods, not only by precept, but by example, in imparting a 
knowledge of their own subject. Pedagogy, the science of teaching, has always 
been a prominent department. They hold that if they filla pupil full of his subject 
he will gain the ability in which he can best teach it. It is a pleasure to teach a 
subject we know and know we know. It is misery to try to teach a subject we do 
not know and know we do not know. z 
At the session of 1887 (continues Dr. Mowry) I had my first experience 
ina summer school. I had astrong prejudice against this class of 
institutions. I had felt that if one wished to become a teacher he 
had better attend a good normal school for two or three years, and that 
a few weeks’ study in the heat of summer was too superficial to be of 
any real service whatever. It is true I had seen and experienced the 
best results from well-conducted teachers’ institutes, but I had not 
thought these summer schools were better than the best of institutes, 
nor especially that they were of far greater value, inasmuch as those were 
generally held for two or three days, or at most for a week, while in 
these the attention of the earnest young teachers was held by the best 
instructors, the wisest specialists, for five weeks under the most fayor- 
able circumstances. 
I went, therefore, to the Vineyard in July, 1887, te give a course of 
lectures upon American ‘history, with the full expectation that that 
would be the beginning and the end of my connection with summer 
schools. I had no intention of going again. 
I was surprised, therefore, to find on the one hand a class of very 
earnest young teachers, thirsty for both knowledge and wisdom, and 
on the other a faculty composed of some of the best teaching material 
to be found in the country. 
With a bright and apt class of minds for pupils, these great teachers 
did good work—work which could not but commend itself to any 
observer. Iwas aconyert to summer schools, if this was a fair sample. 
Financially the institute was not at that time on a good basis. At 
the close of this session it was in debt for running expenses of this and 
previous years to the amount of about $2,500. A subscription paper 
was circulated among the faculty and some other persons, and about 
$1,200 was raised towards paying off this debt. (Let me say here, in 
passing, that the entire debt was paid from the extra earnings of the 
institute during the next three years, 1888-1890, inclusive.) 
The depressed feeling was so great that two of the former directors, 
who hitherto had stood squarely by the institute at all times, saw no 
chance for its recuperation, and resigned their positions as directors and 
corporators. There was, however, a general disposition on the part of 
the directors, the faculty, and all concerned to make a vigorous effort 
to put the institution on a strong and efficient basis. A revised sys- 
tem of management was effected in 1888, and new features of impor- 
tance were added to the school. The most prominent of these was a 
“school of methods” under the direction of Mr, A. W. Edson, agent 
of the Massachusetts board of education. This department held a 
session of three weeks, with a dozen or more teachers, in methods of   
-P-A-G-E-320
    950 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
instruction in the ordinary branches of our common schools. These 
subjects were as follows: Arithmetic, blackboard sketching, drawing, 
geography, history, kindergarten, language, physiology, natural sci- 
ence, pedagogy, psychology, penmanship, physical exercises, school 
management, and vocal music. 
Another important addition made to the courses of instruction was 
the placing of the special department of elocution and oratory under 
the direction of Dr. C. Wesley Emerson, of Boston. The courses and 
instructors this year numbered half a dozen or more in excess of the 
previous year. In 1887 there were less than 150 pupils, while the next 
year the number was nearly if not quite 250. 
In 1889 it became evident that the crucial period in the history of 
the school was passed. The school of methods was greatly enlarged. 
The full number this year was 350. The department of elocution and 
oratory, under the efficient management of Dr. Emerson, was large 
and successful. 
The year 1890 was in all respects the most prosperous and satisfac- 
tory the school had yet seen. A department of high-school methods 
was established, which proved beneficial to a large number of high- 
school teachers. A department of physical culture was added and 
Baron Nils Posse, M. G., of Boston, gave instruction in the Ling sys- 
tem of Swedish gymnastics. The full membership was 700, including 
teachers of all grades from the kindergarten to the college, and coming 
from thirty-seven States, Territories, provinces, and countries. 
This year the institute added a dormitory to their other accommo- 
dations. They had built a café building with well-equipped kitchen 
and dining room several years before. These two additions to the com- 
fort and convenience of the students have proved of great benefit to 
the school. 
The last session of the institute, that of 1891, was in all respects the 
most successful; the numbers showed no falling off from the number of 
the previous year and the quality of teachers in attendance has mate- 
rially improved. 
The directors this year made important improvements to the prop- 
erty of the institute. A large addition (25 by 25 feet) to the kitchen 
was built, a new refrigerator and a new baker were added, together 
with a generous enlargement of the cooking outfit, the café was clap- 
boarded, all the buildings—now five in number—were thoroughly 
painted and put in good order, and the unsightly gravel bank on the 
south of the institute was graded and sown with oats and grass seed. 
Altogether, during the last two years, about $3,000 has been expended 
upon the property of the institute, nearly all of which has been already 
paid from the extra earnings of the institute. It should be borne in 
mind that all the receiptsfrom tuition are used to pay current expenses 
and the instructors. Not a dollar of tuition money has been appropri- 
ated to these permanent improvements. 
The present condition of the institute is in all respects prosperous 
and encouraging. 
I. The breadth of the work is noticeable. There are at the present 
time more than 50 different courses of instruction in the school. These 
are properly divided into (1) a school of methods for elementary stu- 
dies; (2) a school of methods for high-school studies; (3) a school of 
elocution and oratory; (4) eighteen academic departments. 
These academic departments may be grouped under the following 
heads: (1) The natural sciences; (2) the modern languages; (3) the 
ancient languages; (4) the mathematics; (5) English literature, his-

tory, and civil government; (6) music, vocal and instrumental; (7) 
drawing; (8) microscopy; (9) painting; (10) sloyd. 
II. Its buildings, grounds, location, and general equipment are of the 
best. It has five buildings all devoted to its own work. Its grounds 
are ample, and its equipment is probably not surpassed anywhere. 
III. It is incoporated under the statutes of Massachusetts as one of 
the permanent educational institutions of the Old Bay State, and is 
managed by a board of directors in the interest of education and not 
for personal gain. 
IV. Its outlook for the future is highly promising. The directors 
are now perfecting their arrangements for broader operations and more 
extended usefulness. 
New courses are to be added, the academic departments are to be 
strengthened, and the school of methods, both elementary and higher, 
is to be enlarged and improved. One of the special features to be 
emphasized in the school of methods is the laboratory method of teach- 
ing the natural sciences in the elementary schools. At the last session 
of the school 3 expert instructors gave 30 lessons to the classes, and the 
laboratory was open all day for work by the class, under the super- 
vision of one or another of these 3 teachers. 
Appended is a tabular view showing the present corps of teachers 
and the subjects taught.

  IV.—SUMMER SCHOOLS OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY, OF THE UNIVER- 
SITY OF VIRGINIA, AND OF OTHER SCHOOLS. 
THE SUMMER SCHOOL SYSTEM OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY. 
The summer school system of Harvard University owes its origin 
primarily to the influence which Louis Agassiz brought to bear upon 
the spirit of scientific education in that institution and upon this 
country. From the beginning of his instruction his aim was, as far as 
possible, to provide for the training of teachers in the methods of 
instruction which he pursued in the sciences of zoology and geology. 
His desire to secure to them such instruction was, perhaps, the stronger 
for the reason that he received a hearty support from the authori- 
ties of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the foundation and 
maintenance of his museum in Cambridge. From the foundation of 
that museum his instruction was freely open to all the teachers of 
the State. Experience showed that owing to their school engagements 
teachers found much difficulty in attending the instruction which he 
gave during term time. Therefore. in consultation with the assistant 
who was engaged with him in teaching it was determined to make an 
essay in the line of field instruction given during the summer vacation. 
This work was first begun in the year 1869, in a geological school taught 
in part in Cambridge and in part in western Massachusetts. Summer 
field work in geology designed to acquaint teachers with methods of 
instruction to be followed in the. field has been continued with slight 
interruptions from that date to the present time. In 1872 a school of 
zoology was planned, the intention being to openit in the following 
summer on the island of Nantucket. The project having received a 
certain amount of public notice, Mr. John Anderson, a manufacturer 
of New York City, became interested in the plan and offered to Prof.
-P-A-G-E-323
  HISTORY OF SUMMER SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 953 
Agassiz as a gift the Island of Penikese, as well as the sum of $50,000 
for the necessary initial expenses of the establishment. The history of 
this school has been already described. After the death of Prof. Agas- 
siz the project of the Penikese school was abandoned, for the reason 
that it met with no public general support, and the fees paid by stu- 
dents would not support the costly establishment. In the second ses- 
sion the excess of expenditures over receipts was $3,000. 
The evident utility of these summer schools of natural science, how- 
ever, led in succession to the establishment of similar courses of instrue- 
tion at Harvard University in chemistry (1874), botany (1874), physics 
(1889), field engineering (1889), physical training (1887), and to slighter 
experiments in the way of courses in French and German (1888). Dur- 
ing the last summer (1891) the following courses (in order of their 
mention in the college catalogue) were offered: 
(1) A course in the fundamental principles of chemistry; attended 
by 24 students. 
(2) A course in qualitative analysis; attended by 14 students. 
(3) A course in quantitative analysis; attended by 5 students. 
(4) A course in organic chemistry; attended by 7 students. 
(6) One student pursued a course in special research, 
(7) A course in botany; 15 students. 
(8, 9, and 10) In geology three courses were given, known as A, B, 
andC, Course A,inits nature elementary, wasattended by 17 students. 
The instruction in this course was given in Cambridge and in the ter- 
ritory near the college. Course B was given in Massachusetts, Con- 
necticut, and New York, and was attended by 19 students. Course C 
provides for the instruction of students who have been trained to the 
point where they may undertake field work somewhat independently, 
and was attended by 9 students. 
(11 and 12) Two courses in physics were given; one elementary, 
answering approximately to the most elementary course in the college, 
was attended by 20 students, and a higher course in experimental 
physics, attended by 10 students. 
(13 and 14) There were two courses in field engineering, intended to 
train students and teachers in the methods of topographic and railway 
surveying. These were attended by 8 students. 
(15) A course in physical training, designed especially for those who 
intend to teach this subject or to act as supervisors of gymnasiums, 
was given in two sections, one known as the full course and the other 
as the course in practice. These courses were attended by the total of 
83 students, 
(16 and 17) Two courses in modern languages, viz, French and Ger- 
man, were given, the special object being to train instructors in the 
methods of instruction in those languages pursued in this university. 
These were attended by 12 students. 
In addition to the above-named courses of instruction a series of 
classes held at the medical school in Boston especially designed to 
meet the needs of graduates in medicine, which were attended by 48 
students. 
The total number of persons pursuing summer courses maintained 
by the university in the year 1890 was 279. Excepting the classes in 
medicine, courses B and C in geology, and the courses in field engineer- 
ing, all these classes were open to both men and women. Of the total 
about 90 were women. One hundred and fifty persons were engaged 
in teaching, their positions varying in grade from that of college presi- 
dent to assistants in the lower schools. Thirty-eight were students of 
 
-P-A-G-E-324
    954 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
Harvard College or of the affiliated Lawrence Scientific School, who, 
with the exception of about half a dozen, pursued their studies for the 
results alone. Except in the course in geology and that in field engi- 
neering, the work done in the summer school could not be counted for 
any degree. 
Originally the management of these schools was left altogether in 
the hands of the several instructors engaged in teaching. For the 
last four years the system has been under the charge of a committee 
of five appointed by the corporation of the university. This body 
maintains a general oversight of the schools, and provides from time to 
time for the institution of new experiments in this kind of teaching. 
The receipts of the schools were originally left in the hands of the 
instructors. Recently, however, an arrangement has been made where- 
by the corporation determines the salaries of the instructors and pro- 
vides for the incidental expenses of the schools. The fees are thus 
paid directly into the university chest, and the classes are no longer 
speculative ventures on the part of the teachers giving the instruction. 
The greater part of these schools are taught for the term of 6 weeks 
and on 6 days in each week, usually for at least 8 hours of the day. 
Care is taken as far as possible in the period of a long vacation to give 
the students in attendance on the summer schools all the advantages of 
the university. The museums, laboratories, libraries, and other means 
of instruction and exercise are all at the disposal of the summer stu- 
dents quite as freely as they are to those who attend in term time. 
It is the hope of the committee on these courses each year to extend 
their range and effectiveness in such a manner that, as far as may be, 
they shall provide a suitable opportunity for teachers to be abreast of 
their work in every one of the common departments of instruction. 
PROFESSIONAL AND SCIENTIFIC SCHOOLS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
For many years there have been held summer sessions of schools at 
the University of Virginia, at Charlottesville. 
The first started of these was that of law, which was instituted in 
1870 with only 4 members, nor did the numbers much increase until 
1875, when 34 were in attendance, after which the number rapidly 
increased, until, in 1878, there were 80 attending. From that time until 
now the size of the school has remained fairly constant. Ninety-seven 
were in attendance at the sessions of 1890~91. 
At the head of this school, now in the twenty-third year of its exist- 
ence, is John B. Minor, professor of common and statute law in the 
University of Virginia, and author of several legal treatises. The 
duration of the course has averaged two months. During this short 
time it has been the effort not to give much positive instruction, which 
would obviously be impossible, but to teach the student how to study 
and to acquire a philosophic acquaintance with the salient elementary 
principles and doctrines of the law, “so as to enable him,” says Prof. 
Minor, ‘to proceed with more satisfaction to himself and with more 
efficiency to employ the ‘amiablesecrets’ with which, according to Coke, 
the science of jurisprudence abounds.” The scheme of instruction 
includes an outline view of the rights relating to the person, to corpo- 
rations, to reai property, and to personal property, including contracts; 
the duties, powers, and rights of personal representations, including 
doctrines relating to legacies, and the settlement of fiduciary accounts, 
and the exposition of the modes of conducting actions in the courts of 
common law and of equity.
-P-A-G-E-325
  HISTORY OF SUMMER SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 955 
Asummer school in chemistry has been held at the University of 
Virginia for the last ten or twelve years, with a small attendance of 
students, ranging from 3 or 4 to 10 or 12, annually. There has been no 
regularly prearranged course of study, the work of each man being 
arranged in accordance with his previous training and the objects he 
has in view, the limited number of students permitting of thoroughly 
personal teaching. There have been informal talks or lectures, with 
exercises on the blackboard or on paper in chemical calculation, but 
most of the time has been taken up with practical laboratory work. 
Prof. J. W. Mallet has charge of this work. 
Besides these schools of law and chemistry, there have been held at 
Charlettesville summer classes in mathematics and engineering, medi- 
cine, and biology. Summer instruction in the first of these subjeets 
has been given since 1878 for six weeks each summer. The average 
attendance has been from 8 to 10. The subjects taught have been: 
In mathematics, trigonometry, analytical geometry, calculus, differen- 
tial equations, and theoretical mechanics; in engineering, land and 
engineering surveying, strength of materials, and bridge and roof con- 
struction. At the head of this school is Prof. Wm. M. Thornton. 
The summer school of medicine has been but recently started, the 
first session being held in 1891. In connection with this school is to be 
given in the biological laboratory of the university a course upon nor- 
mal histology and bacteriology. The teachers are the professors of the 
university, lecturing on the subjects they teach during the regular ses- 
sion, namely: Chemistry, Dr. J.. W. Malet; anatomy, W. B. Fowles; 
histology and bacteriology, A. H. Tuttle; physiology, Dr. W. G. 
Christian. 
SUMMER CLASSES FOR TEACHERS AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY. 
The trustees of Cornell University have issued the announcement 
that there is to be opened in the summer of 1892, a number of classes 
for teachers. The session,is to last from July 7 to August 18, and there 
is to be given instruction in mathemathics, botany, chemistry, phys- 
ies, philosophy, English, French, German, Greek, Latin, classical arch- 
sology, and physical training. 
THE NATIONAL SUMMER SCHOOL OF METHODs,! 
AT GLENS FALLS, N, Y. 
This school is the union of several other schools, and the history can 
best be given in parts up to the time of union. Nine years ago Mr. 
Charles F. King, now master of the Dearborn School, Boston, Mass., 
formed the idea of organizing a school of methods. He associated 
with himself in the work Supt. Balliet, now of Springfield, Mass.; Prof. 
Walter S. Perry, now of Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, N. Y.; Walter 8. 
Parker, now master of Everett, School, Boston, Mass.; Prof. Payne, 
now of Vanderbilt University, Tennessee, and many other eminent 
educators. This was not the first summer school, but it was the first 
school of methods. Its meetings were held at Saratoga, N. Y. Its 
sessions were largely attended from the first, the students coming from 
many States and thus justifying the name, The National School of 
Methods. The school continued to grow in numbers and strength. 
Its work broadened and included academic work in some subjects as 
well as work in methods. When this school had been in operation 
  
! Kindly furnished by Supt. Sherman Williams.
-P-A-G-E-326
    956 EDUCATION REPORT, 1891-92. 
about four years another school was started at Round Lake, N.Y. It 
was not as large as the National School, but each school hurt the other 
in the matter of attendance, being so near together, and the two were 
united under the management of Mr. King. The first year the session 
was divided into two parts, two weeks at Saratoga and two weeks at 
Round Lake. This plan did not prove satisfactory, and thereafter the 
whole session was at Round Lake. 
At the same time the National School was started at Saratoga a 
movement was made at Glens Falls that was not thought to be more 
than local and a temporary matter at that. At the suggestion of a few 
of the teachers of Warren County, N. Y., Supt. Ballard, of Jamaica, 
N. Y.,and Supt. Williams, of Glens Falls, N. Y., met for one week such 
teachers as cared to come to the meetings for instruction in physical train- 
ingandprimary methods. Nofee wascharged; nopublic announcement 
wasmade. There were about 35 teachers present. At the close of the 
session they expressed a desire that there should be a session again the 
following year. This was arranged, and with Messrs. Ballard and Wil- 
liams were associated Mrs. N. R. Baldwin, who had been a successful 
teacher at Quincy, Mass., under Col. Parker, and Miss Kate Raycroft, of 
Prince School, Boston. A small fee was charged, enough to pay these 
last two for their services; a few circulars were issued; the work was 
somewhat enlarged; Mr. Ballard kept the physical training as before; 
Mr. Williams had elementary science, Mrs. Baldwin primary work, Miss 
Raycroft grammar work. It was wholly work in methods. There were 
about 100 present at this session and a dozen or more counties of the 
State were represented. Those present asked to have the school con- 
tinued and drawing and elocution added to the course. Now, for the 
first time it was recognized that the school was likely to continue for 
some years at least. Miss Swayze, of New York, was engaged to give 
instruction in elocution, and H. P. Smith, head drawing teacher of 
Brooklyn, N. Y., for drawing. Mr. Smith has been with the school from 
that time till now. \ 
The following year the work of the school was greatly enlarged and 
many instructors of national reputation engaged. In the meantime a 
summer school had been organized at Niagara Falls, N. Y. After two 
sessions it was united with the school at Glens Falls. 
This brought three schools—the Glens Falls Training School, the 
National School, and the Round Lake School—élose together, practi- 
cally occupying the same field—three schools where only one was 
needed. As has been stated, the National and Round Lake schools 
were united. The Glens Falls Training School had been run by Messrs. 
Ballard and Williams at a steady financialloss. At the end of the fifth 
year they announced their intention of discontinuing the school on 
account of the loss at which it was carried on. The leading profes- 
sional and business men of the place formed an association to carry on 
the school and raised a fund to guarantee the school against all loss. 
They have contributed in this way about $1,500 up to this time. The 
school was continued another year, and at that time was consolidated 
with the school at Round Lake. This brought together in one school 
all the schools that had been organized in this section. The union is 
known as the National School of Methods. This is the history of the 
school. 
The work has grown year by year. The best instructors obtainable 
are engaged. The instructors’ salaries alone amount to more than 
$1,000 a week. The entire expense of a session amounts to about 
$6,000. More than 30 lecturers appear before the school each year. 
The work now includes both methods and academic work.

  The school wasattended at the last session by nearly 500 students, com- 
ing from 34 different States. _ Students came from all grades of schools— 
from the little country wayside school, from the graded schools, from 
academies, from primary, grammar, and high schools, from normal 
schools and colleges, from public and private schools, and from paro- 
ehial schools. All classes of teachers attended—those who were yet 
to get their experience, those who had taught all the way up to forty- 
nine years, those who were grade-room teachers, principals of depart- 
ments, principals of schools, village and city superintendents. There 
were a large number of supervisory teachers in attendance. This com- 
mingling of teachers of all grades and from all sections of the country 
has of itself proved to be of great value. 
Other schools which have held summer sessions are: The Wisconsin 
Summer School, at Madison, Wis.; Campbell University Summer School, 
Holton, Kans.; Flint Normal College Summer School, at Flint, Mich.;

Concerning very few of these schools has the Bureau been able to 
obtain information. Many of them are now undoubtedly not in exist- 
ence, 
The Wisconsin Summer School tor Teachers was opened for the first 
time in the summer of 1887. Its purpose was to improve the methods 
of instruction in the high schools of the State, especially in the branches 
of natural science. The Wisconsin Teachers’ Association had been 
interested in the movement, the privilege of using the lecture rooms 
and laboratories of the University of Wisconsin had been secured, and 
the cooperation of the State superintendent and of the board of 
regents of normal schools had been promised. Aside from these aids 
the movement was essentially a private enterprise. At the first ses- 
sion classes were formed in psychology, pedagogy, physics, geography, 
physiology, botany, chemistry, and Latin. AIl but one of those 
engaged in the work of instruction were professors in the university. 
The attendance at this session reached 40, all except 4 of whom came 
from Wisconsin. The year following Latin was dropped from the list 
of studies and zoology added, but it was not found practicable to give 
to the school the enlargement desired by its managers, for the lack of 
funds for its support. In 1889 a small appropriation for it was secured 
from the legislature, which rendered possible an expansion of the course 
of studies and more extensive advertising. From this time its growth 
has been steady year by year. In 1891 the enrollment rose to 151; 
instruction was given in 10 different departments, and 28 classes, and. 
there were 33 students in attendance from without the State. The 
school has been from the beginning designed especially for high-school 
teachers, and its enrollment has been almost wholly of that class of 
teachers. There have been also teachers from normal schools and col- 
leges, with a few from grammar grades. A few students have attended 
every year since the opening of the school, and these have usually 
devoted themselves to continuous work in one of the laboratories. 
The number who attend for more than one year is increasing, and indi- 
cates the possibility of the development of a continuous and somewhat 
extended course of study by means of this summer school. 
The Campbell University, Holton, Kans., has held summer sessions 
during the last four years for the instruction of teachers. The presi- 
dent is E. J. Hoenshel. 
The Flint Normal College, Flint, Mich., has held a summer review 
term of ten weeks since 1888. At the session of 1890 85 students and 
teachers were in attendance. 
The Asbury Park Seaside School of Pedagogy was opened in 1887 
with a corps of 24 teachers. The attendance the first year was large, 
but declined the following years, and the school is not now in existence. 
The Niantic School for Teachers was started in 1888, with the sup-

port of the State of Connecticut. There were no tuition fees for teach- 
ers, and, as a result, there was a large attendance, 250 or more. In 
1887 the attendance was less, and in 1890 no session was held. 
The Seaside Assembly, Avon-by-the-Sea, 'N. J., has held 8 ses- 
sions, and is at present in a flourishing condition. At the last session 
instruction was given in the following departments: Biology, lectures 
and laboratory practice, mathematics, political science, languages, Bible 
study and Sunday-school work, Christian philosophy, American litera- 
ture, Delsartean system of physical culture, elocution and oratory, 
kindergarten, art, writing, and music. 
The Seaside Summer Normal Institute at Corpus Christi, Tex., held 
its first session in 1891. At its head is Mr. J. E. Rodgers who has con- 
ducted various similar summer institutes in the State at Waco and 
Marshall. 
The Lake Minnetonka Summer School, Excelsior, Minn., has held 5 
sessions, and with a very considerable attendance, more than 300 in 
1890. The work of the school is planned with especial reference to 
the needs of teachers. Instruction at the last session embraced the 
following subjects: Psychology and pedagogics (20 lectures) methods of 
teaching, English literature, rhetoric and elocution, Latin, civics, 
physiology, history, arithmetic, mathematics, physics, botany, chem- 
istry, drawing, commercial law and bookkeeping, music, and synthetic 
reading.

It is the purpose of the Rockefeller Foundation and its departmental boards to 
have a part in the world-wide movement for preventing disease and bringing about 
improved conditions of health. In 1921 aid was extended to five medical schools in 
Canada, to one in England, one in Belgium, one in Brazil, and one in the United 
States. In China a modern medical school in Peking was supported in full and 
three other medical schools, five pre-medical schools, and 29 hospitals aided. Two 
million dollars were given to Harvard for a School of Public Health; and the School 
of Hygiene and Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, and courses in hygiene 
at Sao Paulo, Brazil, supported. A campaign against yellow fever was continued 
in Mexico and Central and South America. Aid was given to ten Southern States

and two foreign countries to continue the work of malaria control. In 77 counties 
in 16 Southern States, county health organization on a full-time basis was promoted 
in co-operation with state and local agencies. _Hookworm work, now merged in 
county health programs in the Southern States, was prosecuted abroad in 18 gov- 
ernmental areas. Anti-tuberculosis work in France was brought close to the point of 
complete transfer to French agencies. The 1920 gift of $1,000,000 for the relief of 
European children was completed. Emergency assistance in the form of scientific 
journals and apparatus for medical schools was continued in five countries and ex- 
tended to four other countries in Europe

areas, (19) participated in rural health demonstrations in 
77 American counties and in Brazil, (20) neared the goal 
of transferring to French agencies an anti-tuberculosis 
organization in France, (21) provided experts in medical 
education and public health for counsel and surveys in many 
parts of the world, and rendered sundry minor services to 
governments and voluntary societies. These things were 
done in part by the Foundation directly, but chiefly through 
its departmental agencies—the International Health Board, 
the China Medical Board, and the Division of Medical 
Education. 
TELESCOPE AND MICROSCOPE 
“Cure looks through the microscope, prevention through 
the telescope” is the clever phrasing of a successful Amer- 
ican health officer. If the figure is not too closely examined 
it serves its purpose. There has been and still is a marked 
difference between the average physician’s point of view 
and the sanitarian’s. The former deals with disease which 
has manifested itself; the latter seeks to foresee and to fore- 
stall its occurrence. The one thinks of the individual 
patient, the other of the community as a whole. 
It is sometimes cynically asserted not only that the 
attitudes of the two differ, but that their interests clash. 
In a town from which malaria had been banished, a local 
doctor who had almost specialized in chills and fever was 
asked how his profession had been affected. “If it hadn’t 
been for the influenza we’d have gone broke; that saved 
us,” was the half-jocular reply. If the two things are looked 
at narrowly, locally, and for a brief period, there is undoubt- 
edly a conflict of interests. 
But the leaders of the medical profession have not taken 
the myopic view. Asa matter of fact they have been the 
very prophets and promoters of preventive medicine. The 
men who have done most to introduce the telescope have 
with certain notable exceptions been trained primarily to 
concentrate upon the microscope. With them cure and

prevention have been not sharply contrasted but closely 
related ideas. They have increasingly regarded experience 
with disease in individuals as a means of protecting the 
community against it. 
The progress of public health depends upon the apprecia- 
tion, sympathy, and support of the medical profession. 
Doctors will gradually come to think of themselves and to

be regarded by the public as primarily responsible for 
keeping people well. Periodic physical examinations, the 
early discovery of incipient maladies, warnings against en- 
vironmental dangers, the wise control of diet, insistence on 
appropriate exercise, suggestions about personal and social 
life, will in increasing measure replace medicines, hospitals, 
and sanatoria; may even reduce the demand for surgical 
service. Who knows but that the doctor of the future, 
receiving an annual retaining fee from his clients, will feel 
no embarrassment in taking the initiative and in keeping a 
watchful eye upon them? ‘Then a case of illness would be

not the physician’s opportunity but a reflection upon his 
vigilance. 
PROGRESS IN PREVENTION 
Jenner’s discovery of vaccination for smallpox, Pasteur’s 
researches in the causation of various diseases by bacteria 
and microbes, the use of vaccines and sera, Lister's intro- 
duction of antiseptic surgery, are striking illustrations of the 
scientific knowledge of the origin, spread, and prevention of 
certain maladies which has been made available since the 
end of the 18th century, and especially during the last 50 
years. Today hundreds of trained investigators in many 
countries are verifying, revising, and adding to this body 
of truth upon which all progress in preventive medicine 
depends. 
The application of part of this knowledge by men of 
imagination and organizing ability has been a boon to man- 
kind. The presence of smallpox is now a disgrace to any 
civilized community or country; cholera and plague have 
disappeared from the leading nations; typhoid fever has 
been enormously reduced; malaria and hookworm disease 
are giving ground; yellow fever is being narrowly restricted; 
typhus is practically unknown among a cleanly people; the 
fear of diphtheria has been largely allayed. Such victories as 
these, together with advances in general sanitation, higher 
living standards, more attention to individual health habits, 
have resulted in steadily falling death rates in all the more 
progressive countries. 
But it is too early to feel complacent.’ Only a beginning 
has been made. Many diseases still baffle the health 
authorities. Whole regions have been almost untouched. 
Even the most advanced communities fall far short of what 
might be attained. The average individual remains rela- 
tively ignorant and negligent of sanitary science and of 
personal hygiene. Almost all physicians are still too ex- 
clusively concerned with the individual aspect of disease. 
Stages in the progress of preventive medicine are dis- 
tinguishable. First comes control of the physical environ-
-P-A-G-E-13
PREVENTIVE MEDICINE a8 
ment through pure water, milk, and food supplies, adequate 
sewerage and refuse disposal systems, improved housing, 
heating, and ventilation. Then follows control of diseases 
other than those whose causes are water and food borne. 
Various forms of occupational hazards and maladies are also 
attacked. Concern for the welfare of mother and child is 
a prominent feature at this stage. The third stage em- 
phasizes the vital part which personal hygiene plays. It 
is roughly estimated that 80 per cent of the maladies which 
produce the total death rate cannot be directly controlled by 
the sanitarian. He must persuade individuals to conform 
to the laws of health and to report promptly the first sign 
that anything is amiss. 
A fourth phase just beginning to emerge has to do with 
economic, social, and mental influences. Income, standard 
of living, opportunities for social intercourse and recreation, 
all have important relations to individual and community 
health. Mental hygiene, which is coming to be recognized 
as a part of public health, deals with problems of defects and 
delinquency in children and criminality in adults, with 
nervous and mental disorders, with the classification, treat- 
ment, and custodial care of the feeble-minded and insane, 
and related questions. To the support of the work of the 
National Committee for Mental Hygiene the Rockefeller 
Foundation contributed during 1921, $86,370.57. 
CHANGING IDEALS OF HEALTH 
Advances in the cure and prevention of disease reflect a 
shifting of emphasis and a gradual revision of the idea of 
health itself. Being “up and around” or “I can’t complain” 
represents a far from stimulating conception of bodily pros- 
perity, yet a “vertical rather than a horizontal position” is 
one criterion. Freedom from conscious pain would seem to 
be almost the obvious starting point for any useful standard 
of health, yet even this may be misleading. Conformity 
with objective norms such as average temperature, height, 
weight, blood pressure, condition of various organs, results

  12 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
  
  Institute or Anatomy, University Cotter, Untverstry or Lonpon 
Architect’s drawing of one of the new Institutes being erected with Foundation aid 
of blood and other analyses, represents a more trustworthy 
basis of valuation. But after all these are at best negative 
or neutral ideals. There is a growing demand for a positive 
conception which in the individual registers itself in a keen 
sense of physical and mental vigor, a joy of living. 
There is a tendency in certain quarters to extend the 
meaning of preventive medicine from merely negative 
measures to include more positive and constructive ideals 
of community or national health. Sanitation, control of 
contagion, protection against many other menaces, have be- 
come in advanced countries accepted procedures. Attention 
is now directed to more positive things, education of the 
public in personal hygiene, nutrition for young and old, 
physical exercise and mass athletics, provision for mental 
and emotional satisfactions through social and recreational 
activities. 
On the other hand, probably the great majority of public 
health officers who are engaged in practical field work are 
rather dubious about giving, at least for some time to come, 
so broad a meaning to the idea of preventive medicine. 
They feel that so much remains to be done on the negative
-P-A-G-E-15
  TRAINING HEALTH PERSONNEL 13 
side that anything which may withdraw public attention 
from sanitation, control of contagious diseases, infant wel- 
fare, medical inspection of school children, and a somewhat 
narrower conception of personal hygiene, may for the present 
do harm rather than good. But this reluctance represents a 
demand for practical efficiency, not a failure to realize that 
with the progress of knowledge the idea of health is being 
reinterpreted in fuller and more positive terms. 
THE DEMAND FOR TRAINED LEADERSHIP 
Even a hasty glance at the gains which have been made 
in safeguarding human lives makes one realize how much of 
scientific knowledge, specialized skill, and organized capacity 
has been called into service. The expanding idea of health 
is adding new types of technically expert individuals to the 
personnel of health work. The list now includes: officers and 
chiefs who are in general charge, sanitary engineers, labora- 
tory directors who deal with bacteria, microbes, animal par- 
asites, etc., and prepare vaccines and sera, specialists in 
statistics of births, sickness, and deaths, field experts in the 
control of epidemics, administrators of clinics, hygienists 
for infants, medical inspectors of school children, mental 
hygienists and psychologists, leaders in health education for 
schools and the general public, visiting nurses, laboratory 
technicians, food and sanitary inspectors. 
In the United States there are at present about 10,000 
persons engaged in public health work under Federal, state, 
and municipal or county auspices. In Great Britain prob- 
ably an equal number are giving all their time to the work of 
preventive medicine. The number in the service of non- 
governmental agencies of all kinds can scarcely be estimated 
but may represent nearly as many more. The self-governing 
Dominions employ a considerable number of professional 
sanitarians. In Continental Europe health organization 
has not as a rule reached so high a degree of development 
as in the British Isles. In many tropical countries, e.g., 
India, Java, the Philippines. both curative and preventive
-P-A-G-E-16
  4 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
medicine are administered by corps of trained government 
officials. In all parts of the world there is an increasing de- 
mand for men and women competent to do different kinds 
of public health work. A forecast of the probable number 
needed during the next 
ten years in the United 
States calls for 20,000 
persons. 
Only in the last few 
years have opportuni- 
ties for special public 
health training been 
available in the United 
States. With excep- 
tions almost negligible 
in number, American 
  health officers have had

have attained the level 
of “sanitary statesmen”’ is an evidence of exceptional ability 
and character, not a vindication of rule-of-thumb, trial-

depends upon drawing first-class men and women into the 
profession and giving them efficient, modern, specialized 
training and supervised practical experience. 
HANDICAPS TO RECRUITING

preventive medicine. More than four hundred replies to 
questions recently put to students now enrolled in leading 
American medical schools disclose an attitude of ignorance, 
indifference, even antipathy with respect to a career in pub- 
lic health work. The 
reasons these young 
men give either for not 
considering at all or for 
deciding against such a 
life work are: (1) it is 
not a socially recog-

medicine has already gained the status of a profession and 
is making rapid progress in public favor. At least two special 
schools of high rank are offering a thorough and appropriate 
training. An increasing number of important posts are free- 
ing themselves from the trammels of “spoils politics.” The 
salary received by a health officer of full rank probably ex- 
ceeds the income of the average private practitioner. Private 
practice has many disadvantages: excessive overtime and

night work, poor collections, the necessity of dunning pa- 
tients, little chance to study, constant economic pressure, 
a heavy burden of unpaid service, competition with quacks 
and charlatans, temptation to surrender scientific ideals. 
Public health service, on the other hand, is making a strong 
appeal to many men and women of imagination, courage, 
and social spirit just because it does not involve most of 
these things and offers many positive attractions. 
Yet it must be admitted that the sceptical undergradu- 
ates are not wholly wrong. Public ignorance and indiffer-

During 1921 anti-hookworm work went steadily forward in tive medicine 
19 governmental areas. The International Health Board seeks, = 
through practical demonstrations in the control of a specific ee to so 
disease, to create popular sentiment in support of permanent ciety. The 
agencies for the promotion of public health establish- 
ment of adequate schools has been a recent event. A few 
disheartening instances of political tampering with health 
departments have occurred of late. It is also true that the 
level of pay is far too low. Even the few highest salaries 
suffer painfully in comparison with the annual incomes of 
leading private consultants and surgeons. A greater share 
of popular admiration, larger freedom from control, close 
personal relations with appreciative individuals, a deeper 
sense of professional pride, probably are still the portion of 
the practitioner of curative medicine. Persistent efforts then 
will be needed to make public health careers more attractive
-P-A-G-E-19
  TRAINING HEALTH PERSONNEL Ww 
to the persons best fitted for successful work. Much can be 
done to enlighten and challenge medical students and young 
graduate doctors, but the problem calls for something far 
more fundamental than that. 
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PUBLIC 
The cry is frequently heard that this governmental serv- 
ice or that “must be taken out of politics.” In one sense 
this is absolutely essential to efficiency. A public function 
which calls for technical expertness is hopelessly handicapped 
if it be treated as the spoils of a political boss or of a victori- 
ous party machine. To no public service does this apply 
more strikingly than to a department of health. The mo- 
ment efforts are made to influence appointments, promo- 
tions, salaries, policies, law enforcement, by political pressure 
for individual or party ends the demoralization of the work 
begins. ‘The degree to which such things are possible is an 
index of the intelligence, spirit, and character of any com- 
munity. 
Yet in another, the original, meaning of politics public 
health ought to be always in politics. The safeguarding of 
the health of the people is a community task and responsi- 
bility. It is a proper and important subject for public at- 
tention and discussion. Officials are in duty bound to pre- 
sent their programs and budgets to boards, councils, and the 
public and to give convincing reasons for the measures and 
expenditures that are proposed. One of the essential 
qualifications of a successful health officer is the ability to 
explain his policies so as to win support for them. The 
hookworm campaigns of the International Health Board, for 
example, are always preceded by systematic education of the 
community in the cause, effects, cure, and prevention of the 
disease. Only when people understand the purpose and 
methods of public health measures can they be counted upon 
to co-operate willingly and effectively. 
But obviously the busy health officer and his assistants 
cannot assume sole or even the chief responsibility for cre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
18 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
ating and maintaining the popular understanding and back- 
ing essential to the success of modern and progressive health 
policies. Elected officials, public-spirited private citizens, 
the schools, public and private, the press, chambers of com- 
merce, women’s clubs, social agencies, voluntary health asso- 
ciations are the organs by which counties, towns, cities, and 
states should be kept constantly conscious of health meas- 
ures until these have become a part of the accepted and 
well-administered routine of daily life. Then vigilance be- 
comes the price of safeguarding what has been achieved and 
the means of supporting new plans for further advance. In 
the long run under representative government a community 
will get the kind of health administration that it deserves. 
Until recently there has been little or no co-operation 
among the scores of voluntary health societies in the United 
States which are seeking to educate the public and to pro- 
mote various health measures. The result has been a good 
deal of duplication, some working at cross purposes, a cer- 
tain confusion in the public mind. It is encouraging to note 
that ten of the largest and most influential of these societies 
have formed a National Health Council, taken offices in the 
same building, and are working out plans for better team- 
work. During 1921 the Rockefeller Foundation contributed 
nearly twenty thousand dollars to the budget of this central 
bureau. 
A WEST POINT OF HYGIENE AT JOHNS HOPKINS 
The International Health Board realized early in its his- 
tory that a chief problem in disease prevention would be to 
find men qualified both scientifically and practically to do the 
work. An ordinary medical school education is not enough. 
There must be special training in the scientific principles, 
the administrative methods, and the point of view of pre- 
ventive medicine and public health. So the Board decided 
to establish a school of health under the auspices of a uni- 
versity and in close relations with a modern medical school, 
but at the same time a separate institution with its own
-P-A-G-E-21
  TRAINING HEALTH PERSONNEL 19 
buildings and equipment, its own teaching staff, its own pro- 
fessional aims, its own esprit de corps. After a study of the 
various possibilities it was decided in 1916 to ask Johns 
Hopkins University to assume responsibility for establishing 
a School of Hygiene and Public Health for which the Rocke- 
feller Foundation undertook to supply such sums as might 
be agreed upon as necessary for buildings, equipment, and 
annual maintenance. 
In 1918 the new school, housed in temporary quarters, and 
equipped and manned, opened its doors. Courses of study 
leading to the degrees of Doctor of Public Health, Doctor of 
Science in Hygiene, Bachelor of Science in Hygiene, and to 
the Certificate in Public Health, were offered. Brief, inten- 
sive courses for active health officers were announced, and 
opportunities were promised to other types of special stu- 
dents. For the academic year 1920-1921 the faculty num- 
bered 40; 122 students were registered, of whom. 56 were 
candidates for degrees or a certificate. The special six 
weeks’ course for health officers enrolled 29 students. The 
health departments of six states and of Costa Rica and 
Porto Rico were represented. A brief course for a group 
from the field staff of the International Health Board was 
also provided. In addition to the regular courses 21 public 
lectures on selected topics in hygiene and preventive medi- 
cine were given by prominent specialists. 
The school has three leading aims: to provide a funda- 
mental scientific training, to afford practical field experience 
under competent supervision, and to add to the knowledge 
of hygiene. The laboratory and lecture courses deal with: 
(i) the micro-organisms which are the inciting causes of dis- 
ease, (2) the study of resistance and immunity, and the prep- 
aration of vaccines to protect against certain infections and 
of sera to mitigate their virulence, (3) the primitive animal 
parasites, for example, the blood parasite which causes ma- 
laria, the ameba of dysentery, (4) the parasitic worms of 
many kinds, of which the hookworm is the best known, (5) 
the insects by which diseases are communicated, such as the

mosquitoes that spread malaria and yellow fever, (6) the 
collection, arrangement, and interpretation of statistics about 
births, deaths, sickness, ete., (7) the methods of controlling 
infectious diseases, especially epidemics of various commu- 
nicable diseases, (8) the problems of water supply, sewerage, 
disposal of refuse, housing, ventilation, (9) the functions of 
the human body in relation to health, (10) the chemical 
aspects of hygiene, (11) the significance, for preventive medi- 
cine, of mental and nervous diseases, delinquency, crime, 
feeble-mindedness, and insanity, (12) the principles of nu- 
trition and diet, (13) the legal aspects of sanitation and 
hygiene, (14) the rules of health for the individual, (15) 
maternity and child hygiene, and (16) the organization and 
administration of public health work. 
Actual experience in the field is gained by visits to various 
centers of sanitary and health activity and by volunteer 
service in the Baltimore Department of Health, or under the 
Maryland State Board, or in connection with the United 
States Public Health Service. Summer vacation employ- 
ment with state or municipal health boards or other agencies 
provides valuable first-hand contact with problems of hy- 
giene and administration. With increasing numbers of

students, the difficulties of finding enough apprentice posts 
and of making sure of educative supervision will be serious. 
Plans are already under way to establish a special training 
area, a field laboratory. Washington county, Maryland, 
with a population of 60,000 almost equally divided between 
city and country, has been selected for this purpose. The 
county health unit will include: a director, a sanitary in- 
spector, a laboratory technician, a clerk, an attendant, and 
three nurses. A permanent headquarters, a laboratory, and 
motor cars will be provided. A sanitary and contagious 
disease survey will be made and an organization for dealing 
with the conditions will be created. This plan will furnish 
opportunities for training students and for testing methods. 
The project is jointly supported by the Maryland State 
Board of Health, local community and county organiza- 
tions, the United States Public Health Service, the Inter- 
national Health Board, and the School of Hygiene and 
Public Health. 
The investigative work of the School has covered a wide 
range of problems. A volume of scientific contributions 
made by members of the staff and published during the year 
contained 55 papers. The American Journal of Hygiene, of 
which several numbers have appeared, is published under the 
auspices of the School. It will confine its articles largely to 
results of research in the laboratory and the field. An active 
society of hygiene has been established. The chief field 
research activities of this period include: an investigation of 
the diphtheria situation in Baltimore, a special study in Trin- 
idad of hookworm eggs and larvae in the soil, demonstra- 
tions in the feeding of undernourished children, a co-opera- 
tive survey of health conditions among the school children of 
Baltimore. In the last investigations 6,000 children were 
weighed and measured; 1,500 were given medical examina- 
tions. The results showed that between 20 and 30 per cent of 
the children were 10 per cent or more under the normal weight 
for their ages. Much the same situation had been found in 
New York and other eastern cities of the United States.

For the current support of the School in 1921 the Founda- 
tion contributed $250,000. It has also promised to give 
money for a new building and for additional equipment. 
This building, which will be close to the Medical School and 
  Crass tv Prorozootoey, Jonns Hopkins Scoot or HyGiene AND Pusuic Hearra

a museum, an auditorium, and will be provided with all the 
essential apparatus and other equipment for instruction and 
investigation. 
HARVARD EXPANDS ITS HEALTH COURSE 
INTO A SCHOOL 
Harvard was the second American university to establish 
a course in public health training. The University of Penn- 
sylvania was the pioneer. By joining forces with the Massa- 
chusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard was able to offer a 
fairly well-rounded curriculum of fundamental studies in 
preventive medicine and sanitary engineering. Tropical 
medicine was also given an important position which has 
been well maintained. From the outset stress was laid upon 
work in the field. Every candidate for a degree was required 
to make a sanitary or health survey in a community near 
Boston. Fortunately a good many towns and smaller cities 
with creditable health departments were easily accessible. 
Graduates of the Harvard-Technology course gained useful
-P-A-G-E-25
  TRAINING HEALTH PERSONNEL 23 
practical experience. They were successful in securing 
posts in health departments and in other services. 
More recently Harvard, through its medical school, took 
the lead in establishing courses of training in the field of 
industrial hygiene, which deals with the problems of fatigue, 
occupational disease, sanitation of mines and industrial 
plants, physical and medical examination and care for 
transportation, factory, and commercial workers, education 
in personal hygiene, mass athletics, recreation, etc. The 
co-operation and financial support of manufacturing and 
retail establishments in and near Boston were secured. A 
number of investigations were made to determine the causes 
and to discover ways of preventing or minimizing certain 
maladies which are traceable to industrial processes. Stu- 
dents enjoyed opportunities for concrete experience in con- 
nection with the sanitation and hygienic administration of 
factories and large department stores. An important pub- 
lication, The Journal of Industrial Hygiene, has been estab- 
lished under the auspices of this division of the Harvard 
Medical School. 
Admirable as the work in public health training with its 
later emphasis on industrial hygiene was, the Harvard au- 
thorities were not satisfied. They felt the need of adding 
departments which were lacking—for example, public health 
administration and epidemiology, and vital statistics—and 
of strengthening other courses which were undermanned, 
inadequately equipped, and too meagerly supported. There 
was a desire to reorganize and unify the whole undertaking 
into a separate school of health which should have its own 
headquarters and teaching staff. It was estimated that to 
accomplish this and to provide for future growth additional 
funds to the amount of $3,000,000 would be required. To- 
ward this the Rockefeller Foundation appropriated $1,660,- 
000, and agreed if certain contingencies should arise during the 
next five years to supply $500,000 more. The remainder of 
the total sum required was set aside or pledged by Harvard, 
and the organization of the new institution is well under way.

  24 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
The Harvard School will be fortunate in having within 
easy access numerous urban and rural health departments, 
city and state laboratories, a large hospital for contagious 
diseases, industrial and other clinics, factory and store 
health systems, the port quarantine stations, the Carnegie 
Nutrition Laboratories, and many voluntary health asso- 
ciations with their clinics and nurses. All these institutions 
and agencies will afford most valuable experience for students 
and opportunities for fruitful investigations. While the Har- 
vard School will include all the fundamental subjects it will 
not in every respect duplicate the work at Johns Hopkins. 
There will be differences in specialization and emphasis, so 
that the two institutions together will enrich and widen the 
field of investigation and extend the facilities for training. 
Advanced students may well study both in Boston and in 
Baltimore. 
HEALTH TRAINING AT HOME AND ABROAD 
New York University has recently completed a building a 
large part of which is to be rented as a branch laboratory of 
the New York State Department of Health. The Univer- 
sity authorities were anxious to add to the building another 
floor which should house a clinic for the teaching of personal, 
infant, school, and industrial hygiene. The plan also in- 
cluded the remodeling and equipping of a neighboring build- 
ing as a museum to display models and other exhibits in 
sanitation, ventilation, industrial hygiene, and housing. For 
the carrying out of this project the Rockefeller Foundation 
contributed $35,000. 
One essential kind of training takes the form already 
mentioned of special intensive courses for persons who are 
actually engaged in health work. State departments of 
health and the United States Public Health Service are 
conducting institutes to meet this need. In several cases 
the Foundation through the International Health Board 
gave funds to supplement the appropriations of state boards 
of health for institute teaching. A small contribution was
-P-A-G-E-27
TRAINING HEALTH PERSONNEL 5 
also made to a state department which is testing the possibil- 
ities of correspondence instruction for local health officers 
and their staffs. 
The Pasteur Institute in Paris as a result of the war was 
seriously threatened not only with curtailment of its 
activities, but with a lack of new workers who should receive 
training, engage in research, and thus be prepared gradually 
  
  Group at Typnorp Fever Exursrr, Prague 
One of the earliest activities of the newly organized Ministry of Health, Czech- 
oslovakia, with which the Foundation is co-operating, was an educational campaign 
against typhoid fever 
to assume responsibility for the future of this world-famous 
center and its several branches. To supply fellowships for 
a transition period and to help defray the costs of training 
young assistants the Foundation gave in 1921 the sum of 
$30,000 and pledged other sums on a diminishing scale for 
the two subsequent years. 
The new Ministry of Health in Czechoslovakia early 
sought the co-operation of the International Health Board, 
which for two years has had a resident representative in 
Prague. Fellowships for health training in the United 
 
-P-A-G-E-28

States were provided. An expert in public health laboratory 
organization was lent to the Government. Next a plan was 
elaborated for creating in Prague an institute of public 
health which should include central laboratories for diag- 
nostic purposes, for producing vaccines and sera, and for 
aiding food inspection, together with a division for training 
health officers. A complete group of new buildings has 
been planned, to be erected on an easily accessible and ample 
site at a total cost for land and laboratories of about $706,000, 
of which the Foundation has promised to supply $378,000, 
or more than half. 
During 1921 the International Health Board continued 
to contribute toward the maintenance of a department of 
hygiene in the medical school of Sao Paulo, Brazil. While 
a professor from the United States was in charge, young 
Brazilian hygienists who were trained in America on Founda- 
tion fellowships assumed increasing responsibility and proved 
themselves capable teachers and promising investigators. 
From time to time during several years proposals have 
been made to establish in London a central school of public 
health. In June, 1921, a Royal Commission recommended 
that such an institution be created, preferably in affiliation 
with the University of London. The possibilities of carry- 
ing out this recommendation were discussed by British 
officials with representatives of the Foundation and the 
International Health Board in London in the early summer. 
Later a request was made by the British Ministry of Health 
for the co-operation of the Foundation. This was considered 
by the Board and negotiations were authorized. 
THE ROLE OF THE NURSE IN CURE AND 
PREVENTION 
The modern hospital and doctors and surgeons are largely 
dependent upon the trained woman nurse, who has made 
an invaluable contribution to curative medicine. Public 
health administrators are recognizing the visiting or health 
nurse as equally indispensable to the success of public and
-P-A-G-E-29
  TRAINING HEALTH PERSONNEL 27 
personal hygiene. Already maternity and child welfare 
nurses, school nurses, tuberculosis nurses, and several other 
specialized types have taken their places in private health 
systems and in government departments. One state has 
announced as its goal the appointment of a health nurse for 
every 2,000 of the population; another has fixed the ratio 
at 1 to 3,000. 
Questions as to the exact function of the bedside nurse, 
the kind and length of training she should receive, have been 
under discussion for some time. The advent of the health 
nurse raises similar problems. How far should her education 
coincide with that of the hospital nurse? In what should 
consist her special training? How much time should the 
entire course occupy? Should there be different grades of 
both bedside and health nurses? Are there place and 
function for a lay worker or a health-visitor? In 1919 
the Foundation invited a group of persons who are most 
familiar with nursing problems to a conference which 
nominated a survey committee under whose auspices a 
competent expert has been making a study of the subject 
in all its phases. A report is promised in the summer of 
1922. The expenses of the survey have been met by the 
Foundation. 
During 1921 the International Health Board contributed 
toward short courses for New York State nurse training. 
Four nurse training centers in France were aided not only to 
train visiteuses d’hygiéne but to improve in certain hospitals 
standards of ward nursing and administration. The Cavell- 
Depage Memorial School of Nursing in Brussels will be an 
integral part of the reorganized hospital and medical school 
to which the Foundation is contributing a large sum. The 
International Health Board is co-operating with the gov- 
ernment of Brazil in developing a public health nursing 
service. The Foundation supports a nurse training school 
in connection with the Peking Union Medical College. A 
survey of nurse training in Great Britain and on the 
Continent, to be begun early in 1922, has been authorized.

Scholarships were granted to four Polish nurses for study 
and training in the United States. 
MEDICAL SERVICE AT MODERATE COST 
A modern clinic may serve the interests of both preventive 
and curative medicine. Persons may resort to it to make 
sure that they are well or to have their diseases recognized 
and treated. Diagnostic and treatment facilities are now 
available in cities and large towns for the rich and well-to-do 
and for the very poor, but self-respecting people of small 
means are too often at a loss for good medical aid. It is true 
that the leading consultants and specialists make concessions 
in individual cases, but this generous attitude of the profession 
solves only a minute part of the problem. The tendency to 
establish medical group clinics makes it easier to provide 
modern facilities at lower cost, but at best the fees are con- 
siderable, and many people hesitate to ask for a concession 
in charges. Hence the demand for a pay clinic for persons 
with small incomes. 
‘An experiment in meeting this demand was begun by the 
Cornell University Medical School in New York City in No- 
vember, 1921, with the co-operation of a special committee of 
the United Hospital Fund. The work of this committee, 
which is helping to improve standards of dispensary manage- 
ment and service, is supported by the Rockefeller Foundation. 
The initial deficit of the Cornell clinic demonstration, which 
is expected to become self-supporting, was underwritten by 
this committee. 
The essentials of the plan are: (1) medical, surgical, and 
specialist service by well-trained young doctors, who are paid 
for their work, (2) supervision by the college faculty, (3) 
instruction of medical students in the clinic, (4) appointments 
with patients made by telephone or post to avoid waste in 
waiting, (5) clinics, in addition to day sessions, open two 
evenings a week for the convenience of patients employed 
during the day, (6) a charge of $1.00 for each call, laboratory 
examinations and X-ray plates at cost, a complete diagnostic

The picture shows the main entrance hall of the clinic, where new patients are 
admitted and directed to the various departments after the necessary general in- 
formation has been secured, appointments made, and fees paid. Close co-operation 
of a group of specialists in all the leading branches of medicine makes possible care- 
ful diagnosis and thorough treatment at an expense which patients of moderate 
means can afford 
examination for an inclusive fee of $10 for patients referred 
by physicians. On the day the clinic opened 700 persons 
presented themselves. There has been a steadily growing 
patronage ever since. An increasing number of doctors 
have referred patients for diagnosis and consultation. It is 
too early to assert that clinics of this kind will satisfactorily 
solve the problem, but experience so far has been distinctly 
significant and encouraging. 
A MEDICAL CENTER OPENED IN PEKING 
On September 19, 1921, in the capital of China a unique 
academic procession made its way through oriental corridors 
and courts to an assembly hall which in its exterior form and 
decorations reproduced the classic features of Chinese archi- 
tecture. The cortége was a blending of East and West. 
Chinese officials and other leading citizens, some of them in 
national dress, members of the diplomatic corps, distin-
-P-A-G-E-32

guished guests in the variegated, brilliant gowns and hoods 
of European and American universities, the officers, trustees, 
and faculty of the Peking Union Medical College, all in 
academic garb, made a striking and symbolic picture. Brief 
words of greeting and appreciation from representatives of 
the President of China, the Cabinet, the medical profession, 
and educational institutions, a statement by the Director of 
the China Medical Board, an address on the aims and spirit 
of the College by the Chairman of the Board of the Rocke- 
feller Foundation, and the institution in its new setting and 
with enlarged resources was rededicated to the service of the 
Chinese people. 
These simple ceremonies were one session of a program 
which extended over an entire week and included daily 
clinics, scientific papers on medical and public health themes, 
popular evening addresses, sight-seeing excursions, a garden 
party at the Summer Palace, a reception by the President 
of China, dinners and receptions at the American and Brit- 
ish legations. In addition to a score of special guests of 
the Foundation from England, France, Ireland, Canada, 
Japan, China, the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Java, more 
than 300 medical and educational delegates, Chinese and 
foreign, were in attendance on what was actually an inter- 
national congress of curative and preventive medicine. The 
clinics and papers were rated by competent judges as highly 
scientific and significant. The contributions of the mem- 
bers of the Peking faculty made a most favorable impression 
upon the visiting scientists. 
The buildings of the College were admired both for their 
architectural beauty and for their practical serviceability 
and complete equipment. All the essential laboratories 
and lecture rooms, a hospital of 225 teaching beds, and an 
outpatient department, are provided. The entire plant 
comprises for purposes of instruction, for faculty and stu- 
dent quarters, for mechanical services and storage, an area 
of about 25 acres and a total of 59 buildings. It was neces- 
sary not only to build a medical school and hospital but to
-P-A-G-E-33

add to them the housing, water supply, sewerage, electric 
light and fuel gas services of a modern community. The 
cost of construction was enormously increased by the war. 
Prices soared, freight rates rose, silver so increased in value 
that at one time a gold dollar would purchase slightly less 
than one silver dollar instead of the normal two. 
On June 30, 1921, the teaching staff of this Peking center 
numbered 67, of whom 17 were instructors in the pre-medical 
school. About 25 per cent of the total teaching corps were 
Chinese, almost all of whom were trained in the United 
States or Europe. Besides the educational personnel there 
were 15 hospital interns and residents, 28 nurses, 29 mem- 
bers of the business and administrative departments, 22 
secretaries, 11 technicians, librarians, and others. The 
service group of assistants, attendants, messengers, cooks,

waiters, stokers, janitors, totaled 601, practically all Chinese. 
The student registration for 1921-1922 showed 52 in the pre- 
medical school, 20 in the medical school, and 11 in the nurses 
training school. For the previous year 49 advanced stu- 
dents were registered for graduate and special courses. 
This number is likely to be exceeded during the current 
session. The total number of students for the year will 
approximate 140. The fact that only a small number of 
preparatory schools and colleges can meet the entrance 
standard, the length and cost of the medical course, the 
popular ignorance of modern medicine, are obstacles to be 
slowly overcome. In all the circumstances the present 
numbers are distinctly encouraging. 
- The College seeks quality rather than quantity. It aims 
not to turn out numerous doctors—Chinese institutions must 
assume this task—but to train leaders who may serve as 
teachers and investigators in Chinese medical schools, 
hospitals, and health organizations. In its own work it 
proposes to develop Chinese teachers, who already constitute 
25 per cent of the teaching staff, and to give them increasing 
rank and responsibility as rapidly as they are prepared to 
assume them. The officially announced purposes of the 
Peking Union Medical College are: to conduct a high-grade 
medical curriculum for undergraduates, to provide graduate 
training for laboratory workers, teachers, and clinical spe- 
cialists, to offer short courses for physicians, to furnish 
opportunities for research, especially in diseases peculiar to 
the Far East, and incidentally to extend popular knowl- 
edge of modern medicine and public health among the 
Chinese. 
The trustees devoted a week in Peking to detailed con- 
sideration of the problems of the College and adopted a 
policy which calls for: (1) gradual growth rather than rapid 
expansion, within (2) budget limits fixed for three years at 
not more than $1,200,000 silver (about $700,000 gold), per 
annum, (3) the gradual transfer of the responsibility for 
pre-medical education to other schools and colleges, (4) the

they show the necessary capacity, increasing responsibility

clinical facilities by establishing under Chinese auspices 
special dispensaries and hospitals, (6) a steady effort to 
enlist the interest and secure the aid of public-spirited 
Chinese in interpreting the purposes of the college to the 
Chinese people. 
In addition to their regular duties members of the faculty 
of the College during the year participated in famine relief, 
worked out a food ration as a basis for distribution of food 
to famine sufferers, provided medical consultation service 
for a Chinese orphanage, visited many educational institu-

tions to give expert counsel about apparatus and X-ray 
equipment, organized typhus-prevention squads to protect 
the refugee camps and the city of Peking, rendered a large 
amount of private medical and surgical service the fees for 
which went into the treasury of the College, assisted in 
archaeological research, and in many other ways entered into 
the life of the capital and the country. 
The China Medical Board, under whose auspices work in 
China is administered, in addition to completing and main- 
taining the College in Peking, authorized a survey of pre- 
medical education, contributed to the expenses of a com- 
mission sent by a group of missionary societies to study and 
report upon education under missionary auspices in China, 
made appropriations to a language school and a school for 
foreign children in Peking, contributed to a dental clinic in 
return for service to the college hospital, gave maintenance 
funds to two mission medical schools, made a small gift to a 
Chinese medical school, continued appropriations which 
had been pledged to five pre-medical schools, 17 hospitals, 
and to a committee for translating medical books into 
Chinese, and awarded fellowships for study in the United 
States. 
MEDICAL EDUCATION IN MANY LANDS 
Columbia University in behalf of its medical school has 
made an arrangement with the Presbyterian Hospital by 
which on a new uptown site in New York a combined medical 
school and hospital group will be built. This will be one of 
the most complete and best equipped medical centers in the 
world. Toward the sum needed for building operations and 
increased maintenance the Foundation agreed to contribute 
$1,000,000. 
During 1921 contracts were signed with the University of 
Brussels, the Hospiti Board of Brussels, and the municipality 
itself, by which the Rockefeller Foundation agreed to give 
$3,500,000 toward the cost of concentrating upon one site 
and completely rebuilding the medical laboratories and the
-P-A-G-E-37
  MEDICAL EDUCATION 35 
antiquated hospital of St. Pierre. The Cavell-Depage Me- 
morial Nurses Home and Training School will be an integral 
part of the project. The new buildings designed by a leading 
Belgian architect will constitute the most modern and con- 
venient medical training plant in Europe. 
In further distribution of the $5,000,000 set aside in 1920 
to aid medical education in Canada the following sums were 
voted during 1921: to Dalhousie University to meet an 
emergency which arose in connection with a maternity hos- 
pital, $50,000; to the University of Montreal medical school 
for strengthening pre-medical science teaching, $25,000; to 
the University of Alberta for clinical instruction, $25,000. 
The pledge of $1,000,000 to McGill University was paid. 
During the year the Foundation supplied the funds by 
which 38 medical centers in Central, Western, and Southern 
Europe received current numbers and back files of the prin- 
cipal journals of the medical sciences published in English. 
Without this aid it would have been impossible in view of 
present rates of exchange for these institutions to secure any 
considerable number of these important publications. In 
addition to the $100,000 voted in 1920 for apparatus and 
supplies sorely needed by five universities in Central Europe, 
an additional sum of $50,000 was last year appropriated for 
the same purpose. 
With the aim of gathering accurate data about medical 
education in many countries, representatives of the Founda- 
tion made surveys of medical schools in Japan, China, Hong 
Kong, the Philippines, Siam, Indo-China, Straits Settlements, 
Java, Egypt, Syria, and Constantinople. Less thorough 
studies were made of several schools in India. 
ENVOYS OF SCIENCE AND EDUCATION 
Bacon in the New Atlantis describes an ideal common- 
wealth based upon scientific research and the application of 
its results to the life of the people. One of the officials in 
explaining to foreign visitors the organization of the staff 
says: “For the several employments and offices of our fel-
-P-A-G-E-38

lows, we have twelve that sail intoforeigncountries . . . 
who bring us the books and abstracts, and patterns of experi- 
ments of all other parts. These we call merchants of light.”

in a league for scientific progress. 
During 1921 the Foundation made a contribution to 
world commerce in ideas. Its own representatives visited 
Europe, the Near East, the Far East, India, and South and 
Central America. Resident directors of health demonstra- 
tions were maintained in 23 foreign countries. From all 
these men and women came reports, memoranda, and printed 
matter which enriched the files of the central office and sup- 
plied ideas and suggestions, many of which will be at the 
disposal of individuals and institutions in this and other 
countries. 
At the invitation of the Foundation individuals and groups 
visited the United States and Great Britain as envoys of 
science, ‘‘merchants of light.” Two heads of departments
-P-A-G-E-39

in University College Hospital Medical School, London, 
made a tour of the leading medical schools of the United 
States and Canada. The executive secretary of the Medical 
Research Council and the chairman of the Medical Division 
of the University Grants Committee of Great Britain fol- 
lowed much the same itinerary. The president of the hos- 
pital board of Brussels and the architect of the new medical 
buildings visited England and the United States to study the 
architecture and administration of hospitals and laboratories. 
Clinical professors of the Brussels University Medical School 
spent some time in London to observe the operation of full- 
time units in medicine and surgery and the use of out- 
patient departments in teaching. A Serbian Commission 
visited the United States and England to familiarize its mem- 
bers with methods of medical education and of public health 
administration. A noted Brazilian physician, the Director of 
the National Department of Health and of the Oswaldo Cruz 
Institute, came with one of his colleagues to visit medical 
schools and to study public health laboratories and practi- 
cal field methods. 
STUDENT FELLOWS FROM EIGHTEEN 
COUNTRIES 
One hundred and fifty-seven individuals during 1921 held 
fellowships, funds for which were directly or indirectly sup- 
plied by the Rockefeller Foundation. These fellowships fell 
into five groups: (1) 54 fellowships in public health under 
the International Health Board, (2) 52 fellowships admin- 
istered by the China Medical Board, (3) 16 fellowships in 
medical education, (4) 34 research fellowships in physics 
and chemistry supervised by a special committee of the 
National Research Council, and (5) one member of the 
International Health Board staff who, on what is known as 
“study leave,” was engaged in special study. The distribu- 
tion of these fellows by countries was: 71 Americans, 1 Bel- 
gian, 7 Brazilians, 11 Canadians, 1 Singhalese, 17 Chinese, 
1 Colombian, 2 Costa Ricans, 19 Czechs, 7 British, 4 French,

Fellowships for which funds were directly or indirectly supplied by the Rocke- 
feller Foundation were held by 157 individuals in 1921. Fellowships granted 
directly by the Foundation are designed to fit men and women for leadership and 
technical efficiency in preventive medicine and medical education 
1 Guatemalan, 1 Mexican, 2 Nicaraguans, 7 Poles, 2 Salva- 
doreans, 2 Syrians, 1 Norwegian. 
The increase in the number of Foundation fellowships 
during the last few years is significant. In 1917 there were 
61; by 1919 the list included 84; in 1920 there were 120; 
the maximum for 1921, as has been already indicated, was 
157. This rapid multiplication of fellowships reflects the 
conviction that the training of men and women for leadership 
and for technical efficiency is fundamental to progress in 
preventive medicine and in medical education. Fellow- 
ships are granted only to persons of exceptional promise who 
declare their intention of entering institutional or govern- 
mental service. Explicit official assurances that posts will 
be available when the training has been completed are also 
required. The plan is beginning to show encouraging results. 
Already a number of former fellows are occupying positions 
of responsibility in their own countries. 
The fellowships, which are administered directly by the 
Foundation and its agencies, are supervised by a special 
officer who gives most of his time to corresponding with can-

didates, conferring with newly arrived fellows, advising them 
about institutions and professors, helping them to arrange 
their plans of study, visiting them from time to time in the 
cities where they are at work, conferring with the men under 
whom they are studying, securing periodic reports of prog- 
ress, dealing with emergencies, arranging for special excur- 
sions, and in other ways seeking to insure the most fruitful 
use of the opportunities which the fellowships are designed 
to provide. 
YELLOW FEVER IN RETREAT 
The salient facts about yellow fever may be summarized 
as follows: probably prevalent in Aztec times in Mexico and 
Central America; for last two centuries a dreaded scourge 
in Mexico, the West Indies, Central and South America, 
frequently invading North American ports and causing 
thousands of deaths in the lower Mississippi valley; fact of 
transmission by bite of female Stegomyia mosquito estab- 
lished by American Army Medical Commission under Reed 
in Cuba, 1900-1901; Havana and Cuba freed from fever by 
Gorgas, who organized anti-mosquito measures, 1901-1902; 
example followed in Rio de Janeiro and Vera Cruz, 1903-1909; 
Panama Canal Zone successfully protected by same methods, 
1904-1906; fear that canal traffic might carry disease to 
Far East and the confidence of Gorgas that fever could be 
eliminated led to appointment in 1916 by International 
Health Board of special commission to survey seed-beds of 
infection; Gorgas, head of commission, recommended a cam- 
paign of extermination; during delay caused by war, Noguchi 
of Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research visited Ecuador, 
Peru, and Yucatan, isolated germ believed to be inciting cause 
of yellow fever, and prepared vaccine and serum, 1918-1920; 
yellow fever commissions organized in Central American 
countries, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Peru; inten- 
sive campaign, 1918-1919, under Connor eliminated disease 
from Guayaquil, the chief endemic center; 1920, commission 
sent to West Coast of Africa to investigate suspected areas;

(at street corner) 
with occasional outbreaks, most of them traceable to places 
in Southern Mexico, the fever gradually gave ground; late 
in 1920 Mexican government organized commission and 
invited co-operation of International Health Board. 
Up to the beginning of 1921 experience with Noguchi’s 
vaccine and serum indicated that the former when properly 
administered affords a marked protection against attacks of 
yellow fever, and that the latter if it is used on or before the 
third day of the onset of the disease reduces the mortality in 
astriking way. Data reported during last year confirm these 
conclusions. In Peru, of a group of 50 non-immune soldiers 
who were being sent into an infected district, 25 were vac- 
cinated and 25 were left unvaccinated. Twenty of the latter 
group contracted yellow fever, while no case of the disease 
occurred among members of the former. Of 12 yellow

fever patients in Belize, Honduras, who were treated with 
serum on or before the third day of the attack, 11 recovered. 
Until yellow fever is eradicated at its sources, the vaccine 
and serum promise to be most valuable means of prevention 
and cure. 
With the entrance of the Mexican government early in 
1921 into the yellow fever campaign the prospects of success- 
ful advance brightened. The chief remaining sources of in- 
fection were attacked. During 1921 Ecuador, Honduras, 
Nicaragua, and Costa Rica were not invaded by the disease. 
Guatemala reported no case after February 2; Salvador’s 
last case was recorded February 15; by July 16 Peru was 
free, as was British Hondurasin November. From Northern 
Brazil cases were reported but the situation was being dealt 
with by the government. It was gratifying to the Founda- 
tion to be able to advance money for continuing the cam- 
paign in Peru at a time when government funds were not 
quickly available. The advantages of having resources 
which could be immediately mobilized in an emergency were 
strikingly demonstrated. It was another example of the 
efficiency of a unified plan of co-operation. The outlook is 
encouraging; it is too early to proclaim a complete victory, 
but the purpose to push the fight against yellow fever re- 
mains steadfast. 
HOWARD B. CROSS ON THE HONOR ROLL OF 
SCIENCE 
Dr. Jesse Lazear, one-of the Army commission in Cuba, 
gave his life for science and his fellow men as the direct 
result of his studies of yellow fever. Such courage knows no 
stimulus of dramatic excitement, of martial music, of stirring 
battle charge. The list headed by Lazear, of brave men 
and women who have died in investigating yellow fever or 
in caring for its victims, is a long and noble roll of honor. 
To this roll has been added during recent months the 
name of Howard B. Cross, of the staff of the Rockefeller 
Institute for Medical Research, who, after special work with
-P-A-G-E-44
  42 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION, 
Noguchi, went to Mexico under the auspices of the Inter- 
national Health Board to assist in the diagnosis of doubtful 
and complicated cases of genuine or suspected yellow fever. 
He sailed from New York November 23, landed at Vera 
Cruz, fell ill in the 
village of Tuxtepec 
December 18, and 
returned to Vera 
Cruz, where he died 
of yellow fever De- 
cember 26, 1921. 
The Mexican 
authorities and the 
Mexican medical 
profession did all in 
their power to show 
their sympathy and 
admiration. The 
utmost courtesy and 
consideration were 
manifested. By 
formal resolutions,

of the staff of the International Health Board in wy]] and gratitude 
combating this disease 
  were warmly ex- 
pressed. The public health laboratory of Vera Cruz has 
been named the Howard B. Cross Laboratory. 
Dr. Cross, born in 1888, was graduated from the Univer- 
sity of Oklahoma, served as instructor in zoology for two 
years, was a graduate student at the University of Chicago 
and at Johns Hopkins University. In 1917 he married 
Miss Ollie DeBoard. In June, 1921, he received the degree 
of Doctor of Philosophy from Johns Hopkins, where he 
had specialized in bacteriology. In 1918 Dr. Cross had  
-P-A-G-E-45

enlisted in the United States Army Medical Corps and was 
assigned to the Johns Hopkins Medical School for special 
investigative work. 
This young American, well-trained, devoted to the search 
for truth, loyal to a great cause, died gallantly in combating 
a dread plague. By his death science has lost an able and 
conscientious worker, and the world a brave and generous 
spirit. 
CONTINUED DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE 
CONTROL OF MALARIA 
The primary object of the International Health Board 
and the allied Federal and state health organizations in 
undertaking malaria work in 1916 was to prove to small 
towns, villages, and rural communities that malaria can be 
practically eradicated at per capita costs which make 
elimination cheaper than harboring the disease. The cam- 
paigns were based upon two scientific facts: (a) malaria can 
be communicated only by the bite of the Anopheles mos- 
quito, and (b) almost all sufferers from malaria can be cured 
by the administration of quinine in proper doses over a 
sufficient period of time. The prevention of mosquito 
breeding by drainage, by surface oiling of standing water, 
by the use of fish which eat the mosquito larvae; the pro- 
tection of people by screening beds and houses, by removal 
of houses from the vicinity of breeding places, by the killing 
of adult mosquitoes; the use of quinine when mosquito 
control is too difficult, have been tried in various combina- 
tions, most of them with a success that has been strikingly 
convincing. 
For the past two years demonstrations have been carried 
on in conjunction with local authorities, state boards of 
health, and the United States Public Health Service. During 
1921 in nine Southern States new demonstrations were under- 
taken in 26 localities, while supervision of work previously 
inaugurated was continued in 35 places in ten states. Reports 
indicate that substantial reductions in the prevalence of
-P-A-G-E-46

the disease were effected at an average per capita cost of 
$1.01. Reductions secured by demonstrations made in 1920 
were maintained at an average cost of 25 cents per capita.

Each dot represents a death from malaria. The public health importance of 
malaria, however, is more accurately measured by the sickness rate and the loss of 
efficiency than by the loss of life. It has been estimated that for each death 2,000 
to 4,000 days of sickness must be included in the total burden of loss and suffering 
caused by the malaria mosquito 
Investigations as to the adaptation of anti-malaria meas- 
ures to tropical conditions were started in Porto Rico and 
Nicaragua. Preliminary studies were also made in Argen- 
tina and elsewhere to discover variations in conditions to 
be dealt with. Experiments in treatment by quinine were 
concluded in Sunflower county, Mississippi, where by experi- 
mental methods a standard dose of this drug calculated to 
protect individuals had previously been worked out and has 
now been made available to the public through commercial 
channels at a cost of $1.95.
-P-A-G-E-47
PUBLIC HEALTH 45 
In addition to continued investigations in various methods 
of mosquito control, including the use of fish, surveys were 
undertaken in two regions in the South to determine the 
prevalence of malaria and the part which it plays in impair- 
ing the health and efficiency of a given population. One 
report for an area in Southeast Missouri was completed and 
confirms the belief held by many that this disease, although 
less severe than in former years, is still a crippling malady 
which not only impairs vitality, increases suffering, depresses 
the community spirit, but adds directly and substantially 
to the death rate. 
THE HOOKWORM STORY OF ONE COUNTY 
In the spring of 1910 a hookworm survey was made of the 
school children of a Virginia county. This study showed 
that 82.6 per cent of the pupils were infected, and there was 
reason to believe that a high percentage prevailed in the 
population as a whole. There were plenty of external evi- 
dences of the malady. Individuals were pale, listless, and 
weak. Many were bed-ridden. The rich soil ill-cultivated 
produced a bare living. School attendance was small and 
the children who were enrolled made little progress. Local 
institutions languished; social life was primitive, community 
spirit lacking, moral standardslow. The people were carrying 
a crippling load. Greedy parasites were robbing their blood. 
A polluted soil was maintaining the vicious circle of infection. 
The Rockefeller Sanitary Commission, later merged in the 
International Health Board, began at once in co-operation 
with the Virginia State Board of Health an anti-hookworm 
campaign under the leadership of a devoted and able local 
physician whom the people knew and trusted. Clinics were 
organized, the cause, cure, and prevention of hookworm dis- 
ease were explained to the public, curative drugs were admin- 
istered, sanitary conveniences were introduced. Fifteen 
months later a second school survey showed that the infec- 
tion had been reduced to 35.2 per cent. The changes in the 
life of the community were unmistakable. The glow of health

had come to once pallid faces, chronic invalids had returned 
to active work, farms gave larger returns, the school enrol- 
ment had increased, pupils were alert, new energy and spirit

  When the first demonstra-

the United States was begun 
inacounty of Virginia, in 1910, 
82 per cent of the school chil- 
dren were infected. As a re- 
sult of intensive treatment the 
infection was reduced in 15 
months to 35 per cent. Local 
agencies set in motion in 1910 
have kept up the work until 
now hookworm infection in that 
county is negligible manifested themselves in neigh- 
borly contacts and co-operation. 
But the work was not abandoned. 
Vigilance was continued and to good 
purpose, for a third survey made in 
1921 showed the almost negligible 
infection of 2.2 percent. Ina little 
more than a decade a radical trans- 
formation had occurred. 
Re-surveys of many other coun- 
ties scattered through the Southern 
States were made during 1921. The 
results were gratifying and encour- 
aging. They showed what can be 
accomplished by persistent attacks 
upon one widely prevalent disease. 
They will spur the health authori- 
ties to renewed effort on a broader 
scale. Aid in the control of hook- 
worm disease was given by the In- 
ternational Health Board to gov- 
ernments in 18 different countries 
in South and Central America, the 
West Indies, India, Ceylon, Borneo, 
Siam, and Australia. In almost 
every case the authorities assumed 
during the year a larger share of the cost. Investigations were 
also continued into the nature and spread of the disease. 
HOOKWORM BROADENS INTO HEALTH SERVICE 
The process of widening hookworm work into general 
county health services made rapid progress during 1921. The 
International Health Board in ending its specific campaign 
participated in the broader programs which were carried out
-P-A-G-E-49
  PUBLIC HEALTH 47 
in 11 southern states. Before the end of the year arrange- 
ments had been made to aid similar undertakings in seven 
other states. Last year 192 counties in the United States

which the International Health Board had been participating. 
County health measures obviously vary with the local 
conditions. Attacks must be made upon diseases in the 
order of their importance. Costs must be kept within the 
limits of the funds available. In the circumstances the plans 
are necessarily fairly simple and inexpensive. The average 
campaign includes: vaccination against typhoid and small- 
pox; diphtheria prevention; the building of sanitary fly-proof 
latrines; medical inspection of school children, with dental 
and tonsil clinics; infant and maternal welfare work; control 
of communicable diseases in general, including special atten- 
tion to tuberculosis, and popular education in public and 
personal hygiene.   ome eis ok =— = 7 g NUMBER OF CALLS

The following is an estimate of the annual cost of a full- 
time health administration in an average county: salaries— 
county health officer $3,000, sanitary inspector $1,500, nurse 
$1,500, clerical assistant $900; traveling expenses for these 
persons $2,400; contingent fund $700; total $10,000. While 
contributions from outside sources seem to be necessary at 
the outset it is believed that fairly prosperous counties should 
be able to meet by taxation the entire cost of this simpler 
type of health service. An extension of the program might 
call for continued state and Federal aid to supplement local 
funds. 
TUBERCULOSIS CAMPAIGN IN FRENCH HANDS 
The special Commission which in 1917 was sent to France 
under the auspices of the International Health Board to aid 
in the creation of a nation-wide anti-tuberculosis organiza- 
tion was formally disbanded June 30, 1921. Certain special 
representatives of the Board remained in France to complete 
arrangements for the final transfer to French agencies, gov- 
ernmental and private, of the functions which the Commis- 
sion had been performing. These activities were of four 
kinds: (1) medical, including demonstration dispensaries and 
graduate courses for physicians, (2) training of public health 
visitors, (3) education of the public, (4) organization of de- 
partmental and local committees. 
Systems of tuberculosis clinics established by the Commis- 
sion in the nineteenth arrondissement of Paris and in the de- 
partment of Eure-et-Loir have been transferred, together 
with certain sums of money, to the municipal and depart- 
mental authorities. The number of dispensaries established 
throughout France since July, 1917, and modeled upon these 
demonstration centers, has reached a total of 372, a substan- 
tial proportion of the total number estimated as necessary 
to give the nation an adequate system upon which to base 
an inclusive program of early diagnosis, health visitors, 
preventoria, sanatoria, special relief, and individual and 
public education.

Traveling educational units have met with marked success in the anti-tubercu- 
losis work in France. Motor cars and a special railway car have been used for 
transporting personnel and equipment. During 1921, 15 departments were visited, 
1,294 lectures were delivered to audiences aggregating 470,078, and a total of 
8,594,500 pieces of literature were distributed 
From training schools aided by Foundation funds, 249 
health visitors have been graduated. Some of these women 
are serving as departmental supervisors; others are working 
in 168 different dispensaries. The length of the training 
course has been extended from six to ten months. Some 
schools are now requiring two years. Scholarships both for 
physicians and nurses in training have been provided by the 
Board in large numbers. Salaries for supervising and other 
visitors have also been paid from the same source. Responsi- 
bility for these forms of aid is being transferred steadily to 
the French. 
Active educational propaganda by means of traveling 
exhibits, school exercises, public meetings, groups of lectur- 
ers, films and stereopticon slides, posters, pamphlets, news- 
paper articles, etc., has been carried on in 66 of the 94 de- 
partments of France. Motor cars, and more recently a 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  50 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
special railway carriage, have been utilized. This function 
is being gradually handed over to the Comite National, a 
French society for combating tuberculosis. It is proposed 
to create under the auspices of the Comité a bureau by which 
literature will be issued for distribution through depart- 
mental and local committees. For a time the Board will 
continue to support two traveling educational units. 
As a result of initiative of the Foundation’s Commission 85 
departmental committees and over 300 local committees 
have been formed. It is these groups which help to organize 
and support dispensaries and to promote other features of 
the plan. While the Board will not extend this organization 
work to other departments, it will in certain places give 
counsel and aid, seeking to improve organizations and to 
secure appropriations from departmental and city treasuries. 
This task of organization is being assumed more and more 
by the Comité National, to which, next to the Ministry of 
Hygiene, the Board looks for the continuation and extension 
of the anti-tuberculosis movement in France. 
This project represents the only effort of the International 
Health Board in the field of tuberculosis. It was undertaken

County health organizations in charge of full-time health officers were in opera- 
tion at the close of 1921 in nearly 200 counties in 18 states. Health service of the 
kind which in the past has usually been found only in the larger cities is thus being 
rapidly provided for small towns and rural communities

as a form of war-time emergency aid. There is no intention 
of doing similar work in other countries. The Board had 
no thought of providing a complete system for combating 
the white plague. It did not assume responsibility for hos- 
pitals, sanatoria, or direct relief. The American Red Cross 
during the war made generous appropriations for these pur- 
poses. The aim of the International Health Board was to 
demonstrate a system of organization, of special training, of 
popular education, of extension methods. It hoped to stimu- 
late government and voluntary agencies to adopt this system 
on a national scale and to support it as adequately as cir- 
cumstances would permit. Everything considered, the 
response of the French people has been remarkably gratify- 
ing. Up to the end of 1921 the Board had spent upon this 
French campaign about two million dollars. 
CONSULTATION SERVICE AND FIELD STUDIES 
During the year 1921 officers and special representatives 
of the Rockefeller Foundation and its agencies gave counsel 
to 12 state and national governments about health labora- 
tory administration, made recommendations to medical 
school authorities in the Far East, conferred with officials 
of the British government concerning the problem or training 
health officers, lent a public health administrator, a sanitary 
engineer, and an industrial hygienist to the Australian Min- 
istry of Health, contributed toward the salary and supplies 
of a pathologist in the Sao Paulo medical school, Brazil, 
and in other ways made information and suggestions avail- 
able for public authorities, educational institutions, and 
voluntary health agencies. 
In addition to the scientific investigations of hookworm 
disease, malaria, and yellow fever which have already been 
mentioned, the Foundation supported studies of pre-medical 
education in China, of nurse training, of dispensary develop- 
ment, of hospital administration, and the training of hospital 
executives. Surveys were also made of leading medical 
schools and hospitals in Japan, Manchuria, China from  
-P-A-G-E-54
  52 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
Peking to Hong Kong and from Shanghai to Changsha, the 
Philippines, Straits Settlements, Siam, and Indo-China. 
In connection with public health inquiries a representative 
of the International Health Board visited medical schools 
in Constantinople, Beirut, Cairo, Bombay, and Calcutta. 
In the routine investigation of projects which ask for 
Foundation aid a large amount of valuable data is accumu- 
lated in the office files and library. This material forms a 
growing body of significant information about various 
movements and institutions most of which are more or less 
closely related to public health and medical education. For 
example, during 1921 a special visit was made to the Marine 
Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, upon 
the organization and work of which a report was prepared. 
SUNDRY ITEMS OF AID AND SERVICE 
For twenty years, under the name of the Concilium Bibli- 
ographicum, the late Dr. Herbert Haviland Field maintained 
in Zirich, Switzerland, a bureau of bibliography which 
provided printed library cards and bound volumes of refer- 
ences in certain of the biological and medical sciences. 
During the war this institution was so seriously crippled 
that its continuance seemed impossible. Pending a study 
of the problem of international bibliographical service, the 
Foundation gave temporary aid. During the year 1921 
the National Research Council of the United States made an 
investigation and decided in conjunction with a Swiss society 
to assume responsibility for the Concilium. Toward capital 
costs and for a three year period of maintenance a further 
contribution was made by the Foundation. 
A council of associations which are interested in hospital 
development has established in Chicago a hospital library 
and service bureau. This collects all kinds of significant 
information about hospital planning, equipment, personnel, 
and administration. This clearing house furnishes to boards 
of trustees, executives, and others, authoritative reports on 
various phases of the hospital problem. While attention
-P-A-G-E-55
  PUBLIC HEALTH 53 
has at first been centered 
on the situation in the 
United States, the scope of 
the work is being gradually 
extended to include other 
countries. The Foundation 
has contributed to the main- 
tenance of this bureau. 
The American Medical 
Association prints a Spanish 
edition of the Journal of the 
American Medical Associa- 
tion which circulates in 
Mexico, Central and South 
America, Spain, and the 
Philippine Islands. This 
edition so obviously con- 
tributes to a wider knowl- 
edge of modern medicine 
and to a better understand- 
ing between the United 
States and Spanish-speak- 
ing nations that the Foun- 
dation has been ready to 
share with the Association 
the burden of the deficit 
which is involved in its pub- 
lication. 
In answering the large 
number of letters from cor- 
respondents the officers of 
the Foundation and its 
Boards try so far as feasible 
to supply useful information 
and to offer practical sug- 
gestions. It is often possible 
in this way to render serv-   
  Native Hooxworm Assisrs

paigns are aided by the International 
Health Board, natives are employed on

the white doctor who made the micro- 
scopic examinations and gave the treat-

ice even when, as is so generally the case, no financial aid 
can be given. 
APPLICATIONS FOR AID 
The following table of requests for aid made during the 
year 1921 shows that 721 formal applications were dealt 
with by the Foundation. There were, besides, a large num- 
ber of tentative inquiries which never reached the stage of 
official requests. The statistics reflect the policy of con- 
centration, for the present at least, upon fundamental 
projects of medical education and public health.

PUBLIC HEALTH 55 
Likewise a balance of seven and a third millions was carried 
forward into 1922, of which six and a quarter millions had 
been pledged. Tables on pages 58 and 59 present a sum- 
mary of expenditures in 1921 for all purposes. 
The total outstanding obligations of the Foundation, 
December 31, 1921, including appropriations already due, 
and appropriations and pledges payable in 1922 and future 
years, were $23,219,394. The aggregate expenditures of the 
Rockefeller Foundation from the time it was chartered in 
1913 up to December 31, 1921, were $61,081,775. Thus, 
during its existence the institution has disbursed, appro- 
priated, or pledged a total sum of $84,301,169. 
TEAM-WORK FOR WORLD HEALTH 
The outlines of a world-wide campaign for health are be- 
ginning to emerge. Scientific research workers in many 
national centers are in constant communication. Knowl- 
edge is being applied more effectively to the problems in the 
field. Governments are sending attachés of hygiene into 
each other’s territories. Vital statistics on an international 
scale are being reported more accurately. Prompt notifi- 
cation of epidemics is being facilitated. Outposts against 
plague and other diseases are being stationed and supported. 
Leaders and technical experts are in training in larger num- 
bers and under more favorable conditions. Fundamental 
medical education is becoming more thorough and more cos- 
mopolitan. Popular knowledge about preventive medicine 
and personal hygiene is increasing. Intercommunications 
of many kinds are being improved and multiplied. All these 
things are fostered by many methods and agencies such as 
working agreements between governments, the Health 
Committee of the League of Nations, and the League of 
Red Cross Societies. It is the purpose of the Rockefeller 
Foundation and its Boards to have a part in this world-wide 
team-work for preventing disease and bringing about im- 
proved conditions of health, and thus “to promote the well- 
being of mankind throughout the world.”

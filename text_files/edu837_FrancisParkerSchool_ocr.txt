PREFACE 
  
As tentatively announced in our first YEAR Book, the subject of 
the second YeAR Boox is “The Morning Exercise as a Socializing Tn- 
fluence in the School.” 
There has been a morning exercise every day during the twelve 
years of the existence of the Francis W. Parker School, and although ~ 
stenographic notes have been made of many of these exercises, it has 
proved difficult to select from this mass of material the best examples 
for publication. We have confined the choice to those which have 
seemed typical in subject matter and plan of presentation and have 
included only those in which the idea expressed has seemed adaptable 
for use in any school trying such an experiment. A large portion of 
the book consists of verbatim reports of exercises, with only explana- 
tory notes by the teachers. 
The faculty as a whole has shared in making the book, although 
each of its members could not be represented -by an exercise. Com- 
mittees and individuals have submitted results to the entire faculty 
for approval, so that, while there have been at times disagreements 
upon certain points, the outcome given to our readers represents the _ 
choice or agreement of a majority of the teaching force of the School. 
We are indebted to Miss Martha Fleming of the School of Edu- 
cation, University of Chicago, for the article on the “Purposes and 
Walues of the Morning Exercise.” Miss Fleming was associated with 
Colonel Parker in the Cook County and Chicago Normal School, and 
no one is better qualified than she to speak with authority upon the 
subject of the morning exercise.

THE HISTORY OF THE MORNING EXERCISE 
  
Origin in Cook County Normal School 
The “Morning Exercise” was the name given thirty years ago 
by Colonel Parker to the daily assembly in the Cook County Normal 
School. This meeting was different from the usual chapel exercise, 
in that it was fundamentally social in purpose. It. was the active, 
unifying influence in the community. Every morning, at the ringing 
of the bell, all the eight hundred members of the school, the kinder- 
garten and grades, the normal students and the faculty, filed to their 
assigned seats in the dingy old gymnasium. Everyone had his place, 
every member of the faculty a position on the platform with Colonel_ 
Parker—no lagging or absences were permitted. ‘The arrangement 
was necessarily stiff and inflexible, and the exercise formal and care- 
fully prepared, and, because the room was very large, the children 
had to be drilled beforehand to make their voices fill the hall. Yet 
all these deadening influences could not kill the quickening spirit 
which pervaded this gathering. The opening hymn was for all; 
everyone was expected to know it and sing it. The reading was for 
everyone, something full of inspiration, often a chapter from the 
Bible, or a beautiful inspiring bit of poetry. The exercise which fol- 
lowed was short—never more than twenty minutes—and usually it 
was the outcome of class-room work in literature, history, or nature 
study, or in celebration of some festival day or historical event. Every 
class in the school was responsible for a certain number of morning 
exercises a year, and these were assigned at least a month in advance. 
Each person, big or little, taking part in the exercise knew that he was 
expected to make the most distant listener hear and understand 
what, he was saying, and usually, controlled thinking and clear enun- 
ciation was the result. The outcome justified Colonel Parker’s belief 
that a genuine social demand, when understood and appreciated, will 
overcome great obstacles and produce genuine self-expression. And 
those of us who for years were privileged to be a part of this daily 
gathering think of it with a warm thrill of enthusiasm. We do not 
remember definitely much that we learned there, but the singing 
together, the habit of contributing our small best to the common

good was a soul-expanding and heart-warming process, which is the 
very essence of social education. Such was the morning exercise in 
the Cook County Normal School,—a thing characteristic and in- 
spiring. 
The Morning Exercise in the Francis W. Parker School 
The following quotation is taken from a report of a Faculty com- 
mittee, and covers the history of the morning exercise in the Francis 
W. Parker School from its origin in 1901 to the year 1906. 
“When the Francis W. Parker School was founded, its teachers brought 
from the old Normal School not only a veneration for the morning exercise, 
but so strong a habit of having it that it was as essential to the idea of a 
school as was a curriculum. And we found our new pupils willing co-oper- 
ators. In this little school of perhaps a hundred and fifty pupils, the morning 
exercise was at first a crude thing, but a pleasant one, a family meeting. But 
after three years, we awoke to find that with the increasing numbers, slowly 
and unaccountably the attitude had changed. Were not many children un- 
willing to appear before the School? Was not a part of the audience often 
inattentive? Did there not occasionally seem to be a critical attitude among 
the listeners? “Did it not sometimes appear that an exercise did not ring 
true with genuine social action on the side of the participants? And yet, 
our morning exercise still seemed the most precious part of our program. 
But, feeling that we were on a dangerous road, we began earnestly to con- 
sider the question. We needed, both teachers and children, to get back 
to an understanding of first principles. These principles were canvassed 
in faculty meetings, and then the committee submitted them to the pupils 
for discussion at a town meeting. (See report of Town Meeting, Oct., 1905.) 
From that meeting the teachers learned that the morning exercise, despite 
mistakes, was almost unanimously considered the pleasantest and most val- 
uable part of the program, a precious thing, worth almost any sacrifice. The 
discussion was kept to constructive suggestion rather than criticism. And 
under all these suggestions there was manifested a desire for less formality, 
for a return from the difficult thing that we had altogether helped to 
produce to the simple thing natural to the conditions. At the end of 
this meeting, the children elected from among themselves a committee to act 
with a like committee from the faculty in following out suggestions already 
made in this meeeting, and to plan further changes. As the result of the 
work of these committees, the following changes have been made: 
“Mornings are no longer assigned to teachers. Any person in the School, 
teacher or pupil, who wishes to give an exercise, applies for time to the 
committee. Thus there is avoided the strain resulting from a division being 
forced to give a morning exercise whether the work has rounded itself to 
completion or not. Moreover, the feeling that it is rather a privilege than 
a duty to help in an exercise is emphasized. Plans for disposing of the 
unclaimed mornings have been suggested, but nothing has been adopted,
-P-A-G-E-10
Year Boox 9 
because there is no present need, since all the exercises for two months 
ahead are taken. 
“The committee strongly advise that the prepared part of every morn- 
ing exercise close five minutes before the end of the period, in order that 
the audience may ask questions or add contributions. When possible, the 
exercise should be planned with the purpose of encouraging such action on 
the part of the audience. It is usually of no effect to say: ‘Has anyone 
anything to add?’ ‘Are there any questions?’ The exercise itself must start 
new mental action, and then must give reason for expression. The pupils 
giving the exercise have sometimes asked help from the audience on ques- 
tions which they found difficult. One phase of the subject upon which the 
class is not fully prepared may be thrown open to the audience for discus- 
sion. As often as possible, a theme of broad general interest is chosen for 
presentation, rather than one of limited appeal.. To encourage general par- 
ticipation in the exercise, the committee posts every morning the topic of the 
succeeding morning. 
“The newly interested audience, the eager participants, the free discus- 
sion, the general co-operation in making the morning exercise period a 
valuable and pleasant one makes us all feel that at last our exercises have 
taken the right trend—toward informal expression—and that our great task 
is to guard them from becoming formalized.” 
There is little to add to this report. New dangers have arisen, 
new faults have developed, yet there has been through these last 
years steady improvement, and our faith in the morning exercise hag 
never wavered. Each year there have been several faculty meetings, 
in which the teachers of the School have striven with open minds to 
examine the children’s attitude and response in the gatherings. In- 
deed, the morning exercise may be called the pulse of the School, 
registering unfailingly our social condition and welfare. Are we 
over-critical, elaborate, and pedantic? We meet the fact face to face in 
the exercise, in the children’s unwillingness to express themselves. 
Are we willing to be simple, genuine, growing in beauty, and strength, 
patiently and sympathetically appreciating the efforts of the least as 
well as the most gifted ones? We are rewarded in the spirit which is 
reflected immediately in the renewed enthusiasm and eager attention 
of children and teachers. 
During the last year the exercises have been particularly delight- 
ful and satisfactory in form and spirit. Perhaps much of the im- 
provement is due to the persistent dragging in of reluctant ones, to 
our insistence that every pupil shall feel responsible for the success 
of these daily meetings. There has been a greater number of high- 
school exercises than ever before; there have been many more exer-
-P-A-G-E-11

cises of great simplicity; there has been continually a surplus of 
exercises ready for use. But whatever the cause, surely there has been 
a more obvious joy in giving and listening, and a much greater free- 
dom from constraint in both speakers and audience during this year 
than ever before. Therefore from our own experience as a faculty, 
despite struggles and mistakes and discouragements, we believe that 
in describing our morning exercises we are offering to our readers 
our best and richest experience; that we are pointing to the best 
training and practice which our pupils have received in applying those 
principles of Social Education which were given in detail in the In- 
troduction to Volume I of the Year Boox.

PURPOSES AND VALUES OF THE MORNING 
EXERCISE 
  
If, as most of us concede, the school of today is a social organ- 
ization in itself, reaching out and touching other life to which it is 
closely related at every possible point, and so making its own life 
fuller and richer, then it would seem that all things tending to unify 
that organization and to make each individual member of it feel his 
relation to the whole and his responsibility to the whole, are vital 
to the life of that organization. Whatever will put the child into pos- 
session of himself and his material and establish the habit of using 
both of these freely with understanding and taste for the profit and 
pleasure of the community must make for the adaptability and power 
necessary to meet the changed conditions which the larger life of the 
world and the future are likely to lay upon him. 
The school is a place where we live together. A large portion of 
every day is spent there, and the interests of both teacher and chil- 
dren center about it quite as strongly as about the home. We are one 
family, and it is essential to our unity, harmony, and success, that we 
have a time and place for coming together. The table and the morn- 
ing and evening prayer serve this purpose in the family. In the 
school each grade is isolated by the necessities of the case; each is 
. about itsown work. The morning exercise is a common meeting- 
ground; it is the family altar of the school to which each brings his 
offerings—the fruits of his observations and studies, or the music, 
literature, and art that delight him; a place where all co-operate for 
the pleasure and well-being of the whole; where all contribute to and 
share the intellectual and spiritual life of the whole; where all bring 
their best and choicest experiences in the most attractive form at their 
command. : : 
The morning exercise is one means of impressing upon the chil- 
dren the unity of the whole school and of counteracting some of the 
undesirable effects of the separation into grades. This community 
interest is usually a restraint upon individual selfishness. Each child 
Jearns that the interest and the happiness of the whole is his special 
concern, his individual responsibility, that he is a citizen of the com- 
“wW

munity, endowed not only with the rights but also the duties of 
citizenship. 
This meeting is a kind of substitute for the old-fashioned dis- 
trict school in which intercourse was not limited to the playground 
or the recess period, but in which everybody knew everybody else, 
what he was doing and trying to do; in which the little children 
learned more from contact with the older children and from listening 
to their recitations than from their own formal lessons; and in which 
the older ones got that real insight into the interests of the little 
children, that under favorable influence is apt to develop a sympathy 
which unconsciously expresses itself in helpful protecting action. 
At these meetings all the children meet all the teachers, and child 
and teacher come in contact with the personality, life, and interests 
of other children, and with the ideals and work of other teachers and 
other departments. Here the special teacher learns something of the 
various interests of the children and so is trained into a respect and 
sympathy for the work of other teachers and a recognition of the legit- 
imate office of his own work in education, for each teacher must have 
a sense of the unity of experience and the definite relation of each 
branch to that unity if he would have a criterion by which to judge or 
decide about any one study. 
The conditions surrounding these exercises are ideal for culti- 
vating powers of expression—an audience and a child with something 
to tell. They are of untold educative value, because they demand and 
give opportunity for a great amount and a great variety of expression, 
and represent an intense effort to adapt means to a definite end. The 
value of any intellectual product, the status of the mental life of each 
child, is clearly set forth by his efforts at self-expression. It is the one 
means by which he studies, defines, tests, and measures his own im- 
pressions and conceptions; the effort to make himself understood by 
others clarifies his thought and gives added skill in the various forms 
of expression. He plans, he speaks, he acts for the pleasure and en- 
lightenment of other people; he says and does something that he has 
reason to believe they will like to hear or see; he is expressing himself 
with reference to others whom he wishes to make understand him; 
he feels the influence of others; he feels their power, and they feel 
his, and unconsciously he rises to a higher consciousness of himself 
and his responsibilities. Children accustomed from childhood to an 
audience learn to think and speak upon their feet so people can hear
-P-A-G-E-14
Yuar Boox | : 13 
and understand. It is the habit of, meeting an audience every day 
from the beginning that tells, that gives power, skill and self-posses- 
sion, The majority of children trained in this way never experience 
the agony of self-consciousness that an audience means to those edu- 
cated to self-repression instead of self-expression. 
There is an innate desire in the heart of the human being to do 
things in company with his fellows. The lowest savages have their 
feasts, dances, and processions. Religion still has its feast days and 
its ceremonies. We still have our festivals, our parades, and cele- 
brations. The morning and special-day exercises give opportunity 
for satisfying the children’s love of pageantry, and shaping the prod- 
uct into beauty of form, color, and movement. The orderly meeting 
every morning is also a dignified and appropriate place for the presen- 
tation of the little children’s dramatic plays, as well as for the more 
developed drama of the upper grades. The older children make a 
strong demand for dramatic expression of some kind—plays, debates, 
dramatic poetry. They are shy of expressing themselves directly, but 
they will pour out all their emotional life through dramatic poetry 
and drama. It seems almost a moral necessity that they have this 
outlet. It satisfies the social instinct, the love of competition; it stirs 
the imagination, leads to vivid mental action and is a training in 
effective speech and in control of the whole body for the purpose of 
expression. 
Music has always been recognized as a great unifying social 
influence. People who sing together are for the time being moved by 
one impulse and one thought. It is the one art, if we except the dance, 
through which the spirit of the whole can be expressed in a single 
result. These daily exercises give opportunity for the entire school to 
live together for a few moments every day in this most intense spir- 
itual way. Indeed, coming together is a necessity for musical train- 
ing, and the exercises become a compelling motive for the study and 
preparation of the music required by them. At this time the children 
may also hear interpreted beautiful music which is yet beyond their 
own skill, and thus learn to listen and to hear with that intelligence 
which is an essential part of musical training. 
These exercises also provide the easiest, simplest, most natural 
and effective way of bringing the children each day into contact with 
a choice bit of literature, embodying the central idea of the exercise 
—a fairy tale, or some world-story, well written and artistically
-P-A-G-E-15
14 Francis W. Parker ScHoon 
arranged, a bit of romance or humor, a stirring lyric or an inspiring 
scene from one of the great dramas. Children are sensitive to rhythm, 
tone-quality, and to large emotional content, and if the great litera- 
ture is read to them, simply interpreted, it can be left to work its 
own way unconsciously into character. One good thing every day 
means an accumulation of the world’s beautiful thoughts. We cannot 
measure the influence of this immediately and accurately as we can 
that of more material things, the ability to read, to add or subtract; 
but we see the pleasure it gives in the present, and many of us can 
testify to the joy that early contact with great literature has brought 
into our own lives. The children understand but dimly; they feel 
rather than understand; but even you and I understand only in 
part, each according to his own measure. 
Some of the best things appropriate to the children may be 
learned and recited by them when the subject and the occasion de- 
mand it. I need not speak of the enrichment of the vocabulary, of 
the training into effectiveness and beauty of speech, of the freedom 
of body, or of the joys of expression, that result from such study 
and recitation. Let me rather emphasize the opening of the eyes, the 
awakening of the soul to the beauties that often lie unnoticed all 
about, until some bit of literature, some touch of art reveals them. 
Some of us get at nature in this way. She hides the beauty of her 
face from us, until some other hand, moved by a soul with deeper 
insight, wider sympathies, and the gift of poetry, lifts the veil. 
The exercises are necessarily short. This makes it imperative 
that the children under the direction and co-operation of the teacher, 
plan and organize something that is in itself a unit, that has rea- 
sonable proportion and harmony, that is appropriate to the time and 
place and within their possibilities of expression. This gives purpose 
and steadiness to the result; resources are brought under control of 
the will, the expression tends to become orderly, careful, and accurate. 
Each child becomes a cause of things, a moving force, a power that 
makes things happen. 
The children make their preparation to do their part, whatever 
it may be, in an earnest, sincere way, and show sympathy and com- 
prehension in their choice of subject-matter and in the manner of its 
presentation. A grade or group of children’ will work together for 
this common end without thought of self, absorbed in the subject 
and its expression. They will bring all the resources of the School
-P-A-G-E-16
Yar Boox 15 
and even the home to help them—parents, teachers, librarians, mu- 
seum, art, literature and music—and will select unerringly whatever 
mode of expression best represents or conveys the thought. For ex- 
ample, if they are studying a people—its history, life, customs and 
dress—and can convey to others the results of this study more clearly 
by painting or modeling or by acting out some scene than by speech, 
they do it, not because they happen to do these things well, but be- 
cause form, color, and movement more fully express what they wish 
to tell and are with the little children easier to command than speech. 
It is evident that the exercises grow out of the daily work of the 
School or out of the interests of the children in some large absorbing 
outside question. They are usually the culmination of some line of 
study. The subject is sometimes science, the telling or illustrating of 
nature observations; the story of some visit to the farm, the art gal- 
lery, or workshop; history, current events; the massing of the liter- 
ature and music of some special subject or special day; the telling of 
stories that delight the children’s hearts; or the discussion of some 
problem of vital significance in the community-life of the School. 
Therefore the exercises, instead of interfering with the school work, 
emphasize, reinforce, and vitalize it; give it purpose and form and 
furnish the best test of the children’s growth and power to think and 
of their skill in expression. 
The special-day exercises are but a broadening out of these 
daily exercises, and the children take part in them simply and nat- 
urally with as little self-consciousness as on ordinary occasions. The 
great racial festivals are but the culmination of some phase of life 
through which the race has lived: Thanksgiving is the harvest festival, 
nature’s great climax; Christmas, the triumph of light over darkness, 
of good over evil; the birth of Christ, the Light of the World; Easter, 
the new life of spring, the regeneration of the spirit, the resurrection 
of the Lord. A study of the history of these festivals and of the dif- 
ferent ways of celebrating them, leads not only to the life, customs, 
manners, and dress of the peoples of the earth, but gives us glimpses 
of their spiritual life, their aspirations, and their hopes. It teaches 
the continuity of history, the oneness of the race, and the brother- 
hood of man. 
Our national holidays are also the culmination of the working out 
of some great movement in the national life: Washington’s birthday, 
the travail of the nation’s birth and strenuous early life; Lincoln’s
-P-A-G-E-17
16 Francois W. Parker ScHooL 
birthday and Memorial Day, the climax of the tremendous national 
‘struggle over human slavery. The children cannot celebrate these 
days without some insight into causes and effects and into the trend 
of government. They cannot celebrate these days without some 
appreciation of the quality of the men, the high ideals of character, 
citizenship, statesmanship, self-sacrifice, and the spirit of pure democ- 
racy that moved those who shaped the destiny of our country. These 
are surely wise and profitable teachings for all American boys and 
girls. 
The value and scope of such exercises must be determined in the 
end not by theories but by the effects upon the life and character of 
the children and upon the spirit and work of the School. 
: A common objection to such exercises is that they hinder and 
interfere with the work of the School, disorganizing it, and dissipat- 
ing the children’s time and energy, and furthermore are the cause of 
undue excitement and consequent nervous strain, and of that love of 
“showing off” which leads to self-consciousness and egotistic selfish 
action. But the few schools in which the exercises have been made an 
integral part of the work of the children and of the daily program 
can bear witness to the theory set forth here: namely, that the exer- 
cises act as an intellectual stimulus, intensifying thought, concen- 
trating energy, and, by co-ordinating and controlling the impulses to 
express, become a reconstructing force, a process of further control 
and organization ; also that they make for order and courtesy and are 
a large factor in unifying the school and teaching the child the in- 
dividual’s place and duty as a citizen of the school community, and 
thus are a wholesome training in altruistic thinking and living.

PREPARATION OF AN EXERCISE ON WILLIAM BLAKE 
  
During a month’s study, a fourth grade learned to love a few of 
Blake’s poems. In order to illuminate them, the teacher told inci- 
dents in the poet’s life. The children drank in these anecdotes with 
avidity, especially the ones about the visions. Blake’s experiences evi- 
dently seemed like fairy tales come true, and the poems took on new 
significance and interest. One boy brought pictures of Westminster 
Abbey, where Blake drew; another one hunted out some lines of Blake 
in a book of verse; a third brought a volume of Blake’s poetry and a 
book of his drawings; a girl begged her mother to buy “Songs of In- 
nocence”; another looked up Blake’s life in an encyclopedia and con- 
tributed information to the class. Practically all the children eagerly 
made sketches to illustrate the anecdotes or the poems. These drawings 
had a crude imaginativeness and freedom of expression that bespoke 
fitness in the subject. By all these activities, the matter was held 
before the children’s minds and was repeated and emphasized into 
vividness. 
Below are given a morning exercise and a stenographic report of 
two recitations in which we planned the exercise as a culmination of 
our study. 
Teacher. How many think reading these poems of Blake would be 
a good morning exercise? (Many hands.) . 
Teacher. Let us think about such an exercise. What would you do? 
A child*, Read the poems and ask them to guess. 
Miriain. We might play some of them, or some parts of them. 
Karl, I think poems are for reading. A man will make a book, or turn 
a book into a play, but a poem is for reading. 
Teacher. How many think a poem is for reading? (Many hands.) 
Robert. Because a poem is more beautiful. 
Teacher. What is beautiful about it? 
William. The old-time words that people use. They scund so pretty. 
Alexander, If you act it you cannot get the color, the trees, the angels, 
and many things, and it would not be half so beautiful as reading it, 
Teacher. What poem is Alexander thinking about? 
All, “The Night Song.” 
Child. You could not have sheep and lions. 
*The stenographer who was taking notes did not always know the name of the child.

Louise. You could not have the rhyming words. 
Teacher. (Reading.) 
The moon like a flower 
In Heaven's high bower, 
With silent delight, 
Sits and smiles on the night. 
What words rhyme there? 
Children. Flower and bower; delight and night. 
Teacher. Is that all you meant that we should miss from the poem if 
we acted it? 
Miriam. The loveliness of it, and the words rhyming like a song. 
Teacher. I think you don’t mean rhyme. (She scans a verse.) What 
is the difference between that and ordinary talking? 
William, It kind of beats like music. It has time. 
Teacher. We call that rhythm. 
A child. We would lose that too, if we made a play. 
Teacher. Then let’s give up playing them. What next? 
Frederick. Read the poems. 
Teacher. Is that all we want to do? 
Robert G. If it is just going to be Blake’s poems, I think we should tell 
something about him. 
Teacher. How many like that idea? (Many hands.) 
Teacher. What things shall we tell about him? 
(Teacher writes topics on board as they are e suggested. ) 
Child. Where he was born. 
Child. What he was interested in. 
Child. His visions. 
Teacher. What visions? 
Child. When he saw the child in the cloud. 
Child. The tree full of angels, 
Child, Fairy’s funeral. 
Child. The men he saw go to the altar—the apostles. 
Miriam. One time he was sitting on the seashore, and saw the kings 
and all the pages, and the people going along the shore. 
Karl. And once when his brother died he thought he saw his soul go 
up to heaven. © . 
Mary. How he came to write his poems and how he learned to engrave. 
Charles. You would not call it sculpture if he engraved things? 
Teacher. Who will set Charles right? 
Charles. A sculptor makes statues from marble and an engraver carves 
great stones. 
Teacher. No. 
’ Alexander, They have copper plates and with a sharp tool do what they 
want to on this and then fill the lines with ink and press it down on paper 
or whatever they are going to put it on. 
Teacher. What other points do we want about Blake? 
Child, How he used to go to Westminster Abbey and draw statues.
-P-A-G-E-22
Yar Book 21 
Teacher. Should you like to have someone who knows about his draw- 
ings tell about them at the exercise? You don’t know his drawings. They 
are strange and weird. I have seen some of them and maybe someone has 
seen a whole book of them. 
All. Yes. 
Teacher. I will try fo find someone who knows about them. 
Child. Should we not tell about the wife who did not know anything, 
and he taught her and then she helped him with all his things—and the 
name of his first book—“Songs of Innocence”—and why he named it that? 
Teacher. And about the long walks that he and his wife took together? 
(No more points suggested.) 
Teacher. What poems do you know of Blake? 
Children. “Laughing Song.” Introduction to “Songs of Innocence.” 
“Night.” “The Lamb.” “The Tiger.” “The Shepherd.” 
Child. Can’t we sing “The Shepherd” at the beginning of the exercise? 
Teacher. What grade can sing it? 
All. We can, 
Teacher. There is a very interesting fact connected with the song that 
{ think you don’t know. 
Chorus. Tell us. 
Teacher. When the present eighth grade were in the second grade, they 
had that poem. They were the first children in the School who had it, and 
they loved it and used to say it very often. Mr. Cornish, a young man who 
used to help teach music, heard the children saying their poem. In the spring 
vacation he thought about it a great deal, and one day when he was out of 
doors he made up a tune. When he got back to school, the first time we 
went into the music room, he played it for the children, and they liked it 
and learned it and sang it for the School. So it is really a Francis W. 
Parker song. Does that make the song more interesting to you? 
Chorus. Yes. 
Teacher. Do you think it would be a good plan to have some one in the 
eighth grade tell that in the morning exercise? 
Chorus. Yes. 
Teacher. Is there another of the poems that you have heard before this 
year? 
Child. Yes, “The Lamb.” The second grade read it at morning exer- 
cise last year. : 
Child. “The Tiger,” by the present sixth grade when they were in the 
fourth grade. 
Teacher. Miss Cleaves said that the present twelfth grade, when in the 
eighth, studied a part of a poem called “Jerusalem.” 
Child. Ask the twelfth grade to read it for us. 
Teacher. What do you think about the other two? 
Ned. Have some one say them. 
Frances. Leave them out; for everybody has heard them, and maybe 
there would not. be time, and they would rather have those that they have 
not heard.
-P-A-G-E-23
22 Francis W. Parker ScHooL 
Teacher. Do you think the fact that someone has heard a poem is a good 
reason for leaving it out of the exercise? 
Robert G. No, because every year new children come to the School and 
they would not know it. 
Miriam. If you like a book very much it does not make any difference. 
You like to read it again and again, and if they are lovely most everyone 
would be glad to hear them over and over. Then you get the real meaning 
of it. Maybe the first time you don’t listen well enough, but after a few 
times you get the full meaning. 
Child, Have the third grade and sixth grade and twelfth grade and 
eighth grade after we are through with all of ours, if there is time. Have 
our part first and then have the other grades. 
Teacher, What do you think is the advantage of having people in other 
grades help in this exercise? 
Child. We learn something we don’t know. . 
Mary, They might know more than we do about it and when they read, 
would explain. 
Ned. People might think we are selfish and want the exercise to our- 
- selves, and it is nice for us to hear them instead of our doing it, and it 
might be good for them to read it. 
Child. If one of the sixth grade knew they were going to read a poem, 
they would be more interested in the exercise until it came their time to 
do something. . 
Teacher. We shali have to decide between now and next Monday who 
is going to read these poems and who will tell about the different points we 
have put on the board. Tomorrow let us hear the people who choose to 
tell about Blake. We will try to get time to hear the poems too. 
SECOND DAY 
(On the board was the list of points planned the day before, with names 
of children volunteering to talk on each topic.) 
Teacher. Yesterday we began to plan our morning exercise about Blake, 
Without my saying anything, let the children come in the order in which their 
names appear on the board. And remember that you must connect with 
one-another, so the story will be complete. 
René, This is going to be a morning exercise about William Blake. I 
am going to tell you when he was born and when he died. William Blake 
was born in London in 1757, and died in 1827. 
Mary. When Blake was a little boy, he loved to draw and used to iflus- 
trate his own poems. He went to Westminster Abbey and drew different 
things around there. He drew all his life and did most of his drawing 
before he was married, but after he was married he kept it up and iflustrated 
the rest of his poems. 
Frederick. Bilake’s wife did not know how to read and write, so he 
taught her, and it was hard for him because he did not know very well 
either. He loved to live out of doors, and they took long walks and some- 
times went thirty miles. They would stop at an inn, and ‘then go back to 
their hore at night.
-P-A-G-E-24

Frances. When Blake was a little boy, -he never went to school but 
learned by himself. When he was twenty-five years old he married Catherine 
Boucher. Though she was very talented, she could neither read nor write, 
but he taught her. : 
Henry. Wiltiam Blake was a very good man, and some things were very 
queer about him. I think these are true. He had quite a number of visions. 
Once he was at the seashore and thought he saw a lot of kings and queens 
marching along the sand. Another time, when his brother was very ill and 
died, he thought he saw his soul, clapping his hands and going up to heaven. 
When he was a little boy and was going through a field he thought he saw 
a tree full of angels, and he thought the reason he could make poetry was 
because his brother’s soul used to come down and tell him what to write. 
Karl. William Blake had a great many visions. These are some of them. 
-One time when he was down by the seashore, he thought he saw a procession 
of old-time people of history marching. One time he was nursing his brother, 
and, when the brother died, he thought he saw his brother’s soul go to 
heaven clapping his hands. When he was a little boy walking through a field, 
he thought he saw a tree full of angels, and one time sitting in his garden, 
suddenly he saw some little creatures coming along carrying a little body. 
They dug a hole and deposited it there. Once when he was in Westminster 
Abbey, drawing pictures, he thought he saw the twelve apostles of Christ 
going to the altar, 
Teacher. What do you think? Does that-do what you want done for 
the story? I am not asking you to choose the people who seem to you to do 
it best, but whether you think it is right for the story of Blake’s life. Or 
are there things left out, or is it not pleasant the way it is planned? 
Child. I don’t like the way some of them said he saw his brother’s soul 
clapping his hands. 
Teacher. But that is what Blake said. 
Robert G. I think someone ought to tell about his engraving. 
Mary. I thought you only wanted the drawing. I can change it. 
Teacher. It is not true, Mary, that he did most of his drawing before 
he was married. He went on all his life. All the famous book-drawings he 
made later in life. And, Fred, you gave me the impression that Blake did 
not know very much. . 
Frederick. Well he did not go to school, did he? 
Teacher. No, but he studied and was an educated man. 
Frances. He said he got his education from reading. He read all the 
time. . 
Teacher. What do you think about what René had to say, John? (René 
was the first to speak.) 
John. I don’t think it was quite enough. 
Child. I think he ought to tell more dates, when he started engraving and 
those things. . 
Teacher. How many were interested in what René said? (A few hands.) 
How many were not? (Many hands.) 
Teacher. Why was it that what he said was not interesting?
-P-A-G-E-25
24 Francois W. Parker ScHoot . 
Carl L. He just said a little about when he was born and the date when 
he died. 
Teacher. And that is not interesting to you? 
Chorus. No. . 
Teacher. I am going to tell you when William Blake was born and when 
he died. William Blake was born in 1757 and died in 1827. 
Chorus. No. 
Teacher. What don’t you like about it? 
Alexander. He just said it as if it was written down on the board and 
he was reading it. He should have left out, “I am going to tell you when 
he was born,” 
Teacher. Now count these words. “I am going to tell you when Will- 
jam Blake was born and when he died.” (15 words.) Now count thése, 
“William Blake was born in seventeen fifty-seven and died in eighteen twenty- 
seven. (12 words.) It took fewer words to tell the fact than it did to say 
I was going to tell it. Well, I think just as you do. It doesn’t start off in 
an interesting way. Then I felt it was all kind of chopped up. What would 
you do, William? 
William, 1 don’t just know. Each, I think, took a point out of a differ- 
ent patt of the book and told about it. 
Robert G. When he started about William Blake he might have told 
first about his birth and gone on until he had finished that point, and then 
taken up other points, and after it was all finished, told when he died. 
Miriam. First tell that William Blake was born in 1757, and that when 
he was a boy he never had any schooling, but when he got to be a man, he 
taught himself how to read and write, and when he married, he taught his 
wife to do the same. And then tell that he died in 1827. 
Ned. I would have someone say, “The fourth grade is going to tell you 
about William Blake and read some of his poems”; then say when he was 
born, a little about his life, about his wife, about the walks, his visions, and 
what he did just before he died. 
Teacher. You mean, have one person tell the whole story? 
Child. Yes. 
Mary. Change the order of that and have it all blended in, Finish one 
point up before taking another, instead of skipping around and going back 
and chopping it up. 
Teacher. Do you like that? 
Chorus. Yes. . 
Teacher. I like the idea, too. Let us try having one person tell it all 
and see whether he can blend it. Henry, try it. 
Henry. William Blake was born in 1757 and died in 1827. He did not 
go to school, but taught himself to read and write. When he was married his 
wife. did not know how to read and write, and he taught her. It was very 
hard for her and him both, They liked to live out of doors very much and 
sometimes they would take a thirty-mile walk, would stop at an inn, and 
walk back in the night. After William Blake was fourteen years old, he 
started to engrave and he drew all his life. He illustrated his own poems,
-P-A-G-E-26
Yuar Book 25 
and his wife helped him in all his drawings. William Blake had many visions. 
One time he was at the seashore and thought he saw a long procession of 
great people walking along. One time at Westminster Abbey, he thought he 
saw the Apostles of Christ at the altar. One time in his garden, reading, 
he saw a line of little people moving, and it was a fairy’s funeral. One time 
when he was a boy walking through a field, he saw a tree full of angels. 
There were a great many visions, and I could go on naming them all through 
the morning exercise. 
Teacher. Which plan do you like better—having one Person tell the 
whole story or different ones tell it? 
(One person telling the whole story carried.) 
Teacher. Why? 
René. There is not so much shuffling of shoes and stumbling up and 
down stairs. 
Child. It does not take so much time for many to go up and down the 
stairs. 
Mary. One person keeps his idea in mind all the time, while many 
people would not do it so much. 
Teacher. There are only two people who like the plan of having separate 
people tell the stories, so let’s decide who shall tell this whole thing. Tomor- 
row let everybody be ready to tell an interesting story about Blake. We 
might divide up into several groups of four or five people each. Everybody 
will have a chance to tell his story to the group. Each group will choose the 
best one. Then we will hear those chosen and decide upon one to do the 
work at the morning exercise. How will that do? 
Chorus. Yes. 
Teacher. Now what are the things going into that story tomorrow? 
Think it over. : 
Children. That he was the son of a hosier. 
Birth, Why he did not go to school. 
First Book. Studied by himself, 
Poems, Boyhood. 
Visions, How he became an artist. 
When he died. Engraving. 
Walks. Work at Westminster. 
Marriage. Age when he started to draw. 
Teaching wife. Age when employed as an engraver. 
Miriam. What would you do afterward? 
Ned. Sit down and have the poems. 
Miriam. One person might tell the whole life, but not read the poems, 
would he? 
Teacher. No. Here is our program as we decided yesterday: 
One person tells his life. 
Nine fourth-grade persons read poems. 
One third-grade person reads “The Lamb.” 
One sixth-grade person reads “The Tiger.”
-P-A-G-E-27
26 Francis W. Parker Scxoon 
One twelfth-grade person reads “Now Bring to Me.” 
One eighth-grade person tells about the music to the song, which all 
the fourth grade will sing. ‘ 
THIRD DAY 
Telling of the story in groups and choosing of one person was 
done as planned. In-another period, every child in the class read one 
or more of his favorite stanzas, and the class chose the people who 
should read at the exercise, Later, the story-teller and the readers 
rehearsed once in the assembly-hall. 
Morning Exercise 
Frederick. We are going to read some of William Blake’s poetry. Wil- 
liam. Blake lived about one hundred years ago. He was not a very strong 
boy—was different from other boys—and the other boys used to tease him, 
and he would get into a fuss with them, and so his father thought he had 
better not go to school. So he never went to school and stayed at home and 
learned to read, himself. His father saw that he had a good talent for 
drawing, so he wanted to send him to an art school. But William Blake 
said he would not go, because it would cost too much money and would not 
be fair to the other children, and wanted his father to make him an appren- 
tice, to learn engraving. So while William Blake was an apprentice, he had 
five years’ study at Westminster Abbey, and he would go there and draw 
the statues. When William Blake was twenty-three years of age he married. 
The woman he married was very talented, but she could not read or write, 
but he taught her to read and write, and she helped him with his poems. 
William Blake loved to be out of doors... He and his wife would take walks 
about thirty miles, and then they would come back at night. William Blake 
had visions. One time he was at the seashore, and he thought he saw a 
procession of great people—kings and dukes and lords, and all the past people 
of history. Another time he was out in a field and he saw a tree full of 
angels, Another time he was at Westminster Abbey and he thought he saw 
the twelve apostles of Christ around the altar. One time he had been nurs- 
ing his brother, and his brother died, and he thought he saw his brother’s 
soul going up to heaven clapping his hands for joy, and he thought his 
brother’s soul came down and helped him with his drawings. I am going 
to read you another of his visions. He told this story to a lady. (He reads 
from book.) . 
“I was writing alone in my garden; there was a great stillness among the 
branches and flowers, and more than common sweetness in the air. I heard 
a low and pleasant sound, and I knew not whence it came. At last I saw 
the broad leaf of a flower move, and underneath I saw a procession of crea- 
tures of the size and color of green and gray grasshoppers, bearing a body 
laid out on a rose-leaf, which they buried with songs, and disappeared.” 
A Teacher (by previous request). Blake seemed to see farther into 
things than a great many people. When he was looking at an ord‘aary land- 
scape, or a human being in the street, he would see what he called the
-P-A-G-E-28
Yzar Boox- a” 
“spirit” or the “soul” of the thing or person, and he was always trying to 
draw the things that he saw that other people did not see—he seemed to 
visualize the things that he could not see with his eyes. He knew a great 
many people who were writing in London, and he drew caricatures of them, 
the humorous side of their characters, He thought that every flower, or ani- 
mal, or tree, had a spirit and soul, and he drew what he thought was the 
spirit of the rose. He read the Bible a great deal, and was very fond of the 
Books of Job and Revelation. Here are two pictures of his, on the stage. 
This first one is where the Lord appears in a vision to Job, and the other is 
where the morning stars are singing. I am going to read you a few verses 
from Job: (Job 38:1-7.) 
Teacher. For several years now we have been using Blake’s poems in 
the school. One of these the children of the fourth grade are going to sing 
to you. 
Song. “The Shepherd.” 
Ada (eighth grade). The eighth grade feels that this song belongs to 
them, because when we were in the second grade we studied about the shep- 
herds, and when Mr. Cornish found that we were so fond of this poem about 
the shepherd, he set it to music for us. And it was a much delighted second 
grade when this song was brought in.* 
Teacher. The third grade (last year when they were in the second 
grade) learned one of Blake’s poems. Juniata will recite it now. 
Juniata recites “The Lamb,” 
Teacher. When the present eighth grade were in the fourth, some of 
them were very fond of “The Tiger.” Hermon will recite it. 
Hermon reads “The Tiger.” 
Teacher. When the present twelfth grade were in the eighth, they 
studied a few lines of Blake. Doris gave them in a morning exercise then. 
She is going to give them again. 
Doris reads “Bring me my bow of burning gold.” 
Teacher. We have learned three new ones this year. 
Charles (fourth grade) reads Introduction to “Songs of Innocence.” 
Mary (fourth grade) reads “The Laughing Song.” 
Louise, Margaret, William, Henry, René (all fourth grade) read the six 
stanzas of “Night.” 
*Nore—A curious and amusing mistake occurred concerning this point. The teacher 
who did the work mentioned in the second grade, remembered the wrong class as having 
been the recipients of Mr. Cornish’s gift of the song. In some strange way (by uncon- 
scious suggestion, doubtless}, the class which she thought the right one apparently remem- 
bered the incident in all its details, and recited them to their eighth-grade teacher, when 
she asked about the song. One of them velunteered to tell the school. After the exer- 
cises, however, same members of the ninth grade went to the fourth-grade teacher in 
mingled amusement and displeasure, averring that it was their class for whom the song 
had been written, Records were ransacked, and their contention was found to be right. 
In accordance with their own plan, two or three mornings later they helped the fourth 
grade to sing the song again and one of them explained as follows: 
Geneva (ninth grade). The ninth grade was quite shocked the other day when the 
eighth grade people announced that this song had been written for them. When we were 
in the second grade, we were very happy indeed when Mr. Cornish wrote the music for 
these words for us, and we don’t want you to think that there are only two of the second 
grade people left, because there are about six of us.

THE MAKING OF A PLAY IN A PRIMARY GRADE 
  
For several years the historical study in the fourth grade has been 
Greek life and story, and it has constituted the children’s chief inter- 
est. The subject was chosen because it gave scope to the free expres- 
siveness of children of this age. It gives fresh material, too, for fancy, 
which. at this time is still active but is beginning to veer off from 
childish fairies and their like. It feeds the love of beauty which is 
here coming to birth, but easily dies from lack of careful tending. 
As the year has been planned, the children hear and read stories of 
gods and heroes, of nymphs and fanciful beings. They learn how 
the Greeks worshiped arid how they felt toward gods and mountains 
and sea. They study the life of the people in their homes, their 
schools, their market-place, their theater. They seek Greek vases and 
casts of Greek statues, and learn the story of their making. They 
hear how men have uncovered Mycenae and Olympia and many a 
beautiful statue. As they acquire this knowledge, it must always 
break bounds and escape into expression. They make vases after the 
Greek shapes and make such paintings as they think a Greek potter 
might have liked. They play sculptor and make clay statuettes of 
their favorite gods and mould figures to illustrate a story. They 
model Mycenae in sand-pans, ruin it, cover it, and become the exca- 
vators who bring its treasures to light again. They write prayers 
to Dionysus and stories such as they think Orpheus might have sung. 
They play Greek games and wear Greek costumes, and, what is 
more to the present point, they are continually acting out stories or 
incidents that please them. Today, as the heroes of Troy, they have a 
battle at recess time with wooden swords and barrel covers. In class 
time, with prayers and dances and an extempore song, they hold a 
Dionysiac festival. Again, half of them are Athenians, and half of 
them Spartans in a war of words as to which city is more to be desired. 
Or they are freemen of Athens, replying spiritedly to the haughty 
Persian’s message. Always what goes in as knowledge must in some 
way come out as action—painting, drawing, modeling, singing, writ- 
ing, dramatizing. 
Three or four years ago, a class had read a tale of Achilles at 
Troy and had been strongly interested, some of them violently siding 
28
-P-A-G-E-30
Yar Boox 29 
with the hero against the “dog-faced” Agamemnon, others rising to a 
moral height and nobly blaming him for his selfishness. JI thought I 
saw a chance to drive the moral lesson a little deeper. It would be 
good, moreover, to purge our souls in Aristotelean fashion by acting 
out these seething emotions. With a theme that so enlisted feeling, 
we should surely get vigorous, creative acting. So I suggested mak- 
inga play. As always, the idea was hailed with joy. 
Many times before this I had had experience with plays so sliced 
up into acts that drawing the curtain had occupied more time than the 
dialogue. . My excuse to myself had been that that was the way the 
children had planned it. But I had now begun to think that it was 
as much my business to supervise children’s play-making as their 
number work, and not to let their untrained habits run riot there any 
more than among the multiplication tables. So I took a short cut and 
said: “Now, let’s not try to tell the whole story of Achilles in our 
play, but just his getting angry and getting over it.” The suggestion 
was adopted. 
Now attention was focused upon a small area of the story, and 
some fulness of delineation was possible. There is always, I suppose, 
a good deal of vagueness and delay in the attack. When your boat 
lies beached, it takes much shouting and running about to get it 
launched. “What is going to happen first?” was our starting ques- 
tion. “The quarrel,” was the class answer. Now, to be sure, not all 
the children at once cried one answer in one voice. But the same 
thing happened that we all have seen occur in a large social group— 
be it a class of children or a political convention. Some original gen- 
ius ventured a suggestion. This released the gears in other brains, 
and more suggestions came. Analytical minds saw difficulties and 
advantages; opinions were modified, and new suggestions made, until 
one came that brought a glow and a nod of satisfaction from the ma- 
jority of the class. That one we adopted, and we then moved for- 
ward at my command, for creation must go on-with a dash, while the 
fife and drums are playing. So any piece of composite work, as op- 
posed to individual writing, hints at dead and wounded ideas and 
lost causes along the line of march. Generally it is worth while to 
stop and argue out a moot point, but if there is a sign that the in- 
terest of the majority is flagging, up standards and forward! and 
leave the malcontents to clamor. “What shall happen next? and 
next?” So we worked out our plot-quarrel, meeting to discuss how
-P-A-G-E-31

to get Achilles back, Achilles’ refusal to return, death of Patroclus, 
reconciliation of Achilles and Agamemnon. The children pondered 
the plot with delight. The climax perfectly. satisfied them. Achilles 
and Agamemnon should shake hands and say, “Let bygones be by- 
gones,” and we could forgive Achilles and be happy. 
This planning was all done in one day. The next morning, I 
saw that the children weré hungry for acting, and that they must not 
be put off with further planning of details. I chose the most enthu- 
siastie volunteers for Achilles and Agamemnon and Calchas. They 
came up to act and flatly failed—could not think of a word to say. 
Then I asked, “Well, what could they say?” We heard any speech 
that anybody had to offer, picked another troupe and tried again. 
Next day there was less eagerness about volunteering to act, and some- 
one explained: “You get. up there and you don’t know what to say.” 
So we thereupon set about planning the speeches of the scene. A 
child gave a speech, another improved it, a third offered a substitute, 
the class expressed its preference, and I wrote it down. Then on to 
the next! On the following day, the scene as composed was on the 
board, and the class read it aloud to hear how it sounded. There 
was sharp criticism, and we made many changes. Often children 
referred to the story in the books and found speeches there and read 
them aloud. Once or twice, discouragement or weariness threatened 
when we lingered too long over a point, and I had to say: “Let’s 
change that later and go on to the next speech.” Or perhaps I could 
give a satisfactory sentence myself and end the trouble—anything to 
make the period close with an agreeable feeling of having done some- 
thing good and of having got on a long way. When the play was 
finished, we acted it to our own great joy and to the more tempered © 
pleasure of the school audience: 
Three years later I was casting about for some means of review- 
ing and clinching the story of Achilles for another class, and I put 
into their hands copies of the old play. “Oh, can’t we act. it?” was 
the cry. We did so then and there, and the children wanted to play 
it before the whole School at morning exercise time. But I remarked 
that every class ought to do a little better than its predecessors. Could 
they improve this play? There were-a few children in the group with 
unusual literary appreciation. Moreover, we had read and studied 
some of Lang’s beautiful translations of the Homeric Hymns, and 
they had quickened the “love of lovely words.” Now one of these
-P-A-G-E-32
Year Boox 31 
appreciative people said concerning the old play: “The words aren’t 
very pretty. They sound too common.” Several people agreed. Then 
we studied the play, speech by speech, and these gifted ones here and 
there embellished the original. Once I read the words that Homer 
puts into the mouths of the heroes. It was hard reading for children, 
but many of them greeted it with wondering joy. “Let’s have it 
just like that,” some said. But the Philistines objected ; “It’s too long. 
Nobody could learn that.” Others, whose ears were open, said: “It 
doesn’t sound like the rest. If we have that speech, we’ll have to 
change the whole play.” On some days the literary coterie won 
the point, on other days the utilitarians; often we compromised, and 
sometimes I put in a tiding-over sentence, so that in the finished play 
there is a good deal of fluctuation in the style. There was often a call 
for the Iliad, when invention failed. Its use reacted upon the chil- 
dren’s own vocabulary. “I will not slay you,” someone suggested for 
a certain speech and explained that he used “slay” because “kill 
sounded ugly.” Another much-discussed sentence was: “These golden 
cups are beautiful; they shine like the stars.’ Somebody had said, 
“They glitter like the sun,” but one boy was eloquent in opposition. 
“Glitter sounds cheap,” he said. “It sounds like a Christmas-tree 
ornament ; and the sun is awful bright and it hurts your eyes. I think 
it would be better to say, ‘Shine like the stars.’ ” 
After they had worked with the play for a little, the class thought 
that it did not feel ended with the reconciliation of Achilles and 
Agamemnon. “THe” (that is, Achilles) “hasn’t done anything,” one 
little girl said. “We want people to like him. I think he was awfully 
generous when he was nice to Priam. I think we ought to have that 
part.” But by this time the class was a bit exhausted by its creative 
labors. So I appointed a committee of five from among the unwearied 
literary ones (and these were, of course, the most fluent readers). 
I put the Tliad into their hands, with some places marked where I - 
thought they might get help, and let them work together for three-or 
four periods in a snug, retired corner of the hall. They wrote: the 
last act much as it appears below, though, in the hurry of preparing 
it for the printer, T tinkered it a little in the interest of continuity. 
My purpose in so doing was not to embellish the play for publication 
but to forestall disappointment among the children when they should 
subject their composition to the severe test of dramatic study and 
presentation, But in one instance I overstepped the bounds. The
-P-A-G-E-33
32 Francois. W. Parker ScHoorn 
Tliad has Priam speak of the “grievous pathway of old age,” and the 
committee had so transcribed it. I, however, thought this too bitter 
a touch for younglings and eliminated the adjective. Our Priam was 
one of the committee that had written the act, and after she had re- 
ceived her printed copy she came to me privately and said: “Oh, why 
did you leave out ‘grievous?’ I like it so much! It sounds so pretty! 
Can’t we have itin?” Of course it was restored. Let this one example 
serve as witness of the fact that to the children almost every word 
of the play was vitally significant. 
The dialogue changed somewhat during rehearsals. In two or 
three places an actor felt awkward and said: “I ought to have some- 
‘thing to say.” An instance is where the visitors entered Achilles’ 
hut and shook hands in silence. Discomfort and awkwardness were 
patent. But when each actor had improvised a sentence of greeting, 
commonplace though it was, the whole feeling of the scene was 
changed. In other places a speech proved to fall short of the occasion. 
Perhaps the developing emotion outgrew it and perforce improved it. 
Our Priam, for example, at. first had the light manner befitting an 
afternoon tea. Yet, one day, after the class had tried by various means 
to make her feel the sadness of the old king’s situation, she leaped 
suddenly to appreciation of the tragedy. Then, under the stress of 
her new emotional understanding, she said: “I’d rather say something 
that isn’t printed. I want to say, ‘Now, who would have thought that 
Achilles would do a favor for an old man with gray hair?” This 
plasticity is one of the greatest advantages of a home-made play— 
it is always in the making. The conditions of change and flexibility 
is the atmosphere which best engenders creative and really interpre- 
tative work. 
When we acted our play the children were in Greek costume, but 
they had already worn it every day for three or four months. In- 
~ deed, they thought they were Greeks. The cast is largely composed 
of warriors, yet we had only one piece of armor—a great shield to 
make Agememnon feel kingly. Every boy, however, by hook or crook, 
possessed himself of a sword or a spear and felt as fierce as Ares. 
As for setting, we had bare walls and empty stage, except when it 
was necessary for someone to sit down. Then we had backless benches 
that we had made. At first the children wanted to build the prow 
of a ship out of cardboard to lend realism to the scene where Achilles 
is watching the fight. But that could wait, of course, so we went on
-P-A-G-E-34
Year Boox 33 
with our rehearsing on a bare stage. Meantime, true interpretation 
seemed to gain importance in the children’s minds, and accessories 
lost it; for toward the end no one again suggested the ship’s prow, 
and the bare stage quite satisfied everybody. A judicious lack of 
attention to minor matters often will put them into their place in 
this way. And what we want is utter simplicity of staging as of .act- 
ing. We are striving, not to please the audience by a finished produc- 
tion, but to help our actors to grow in expressiveness, in completeness 
of dramatic imagery, in power of emotional conception. 
The Wrath of Achilles 
(Made and acted by the Fourth Grade, Francis W, Parker School.) 
ACT I 
(Soldiers are gathered about a pile of spoils. Two slaves sit crouched 
among the treasure.) 
Agamemnon. We have fought a brave fight today. I am proud of you, 
my men. We have captured a city, and have brought home much spoil. 
What shall be done with it? 
First Soldier. Let us divide it among us. 
All, Aye! Aye! 
Second Soldier. But the bravest deserve the best. 
Third Soldier. To our leader, Agamemnon, let us give these golden 
dishes and the beautiful maiden Chryseis, for a servant. 
All. Aye! Good! 
Fourth Soldier. Achilles has done many brave deeds today. 
All. True! Aye! Achilles! 
Third Soldier: He saved our lives! 
Fifth Soldier. It was he who broke in the gates! + 
Sixth Soldier. Many treasures he captured! Let us give him the best! 
All, Aye! The best! Achilles! 
Seventh Soldier. Let us give him beautiful Briseis to serve him. 
All. Aye-aye! Aye! 
Seventh Soldier. And now for our share! 
(Soldiers divide the spoils, talking as they do so.) 
First Soldier. I got this sword from the king’s palace. 
Second Soldier. Ah! But these golden cups are beautiful! They shine 
like the stars. 
Third Soldier. This goblet looks as thought it had come from the house 
of Apollo. 
Fourth Soldier. And this plate has the carving of Athene on it. 
Fifth Soldier, Here is the tripod that held the holy fire. 
. Sixth Soldier, We have many spoils, but we have not yet rescued Helen. 
Seventh Soldier. Ab! If we could only get Helen back and end this 
long war! 
First Soldier. But tomorrow we must fight again! 
.  (Chryses enters.) 
Chryses. Noble Agamemnon and brave Greeks, may the gods be kind
-P-A-G-E-35
34 Franots W. Parker ScHooL 
to you! May you get back Helen! May you go home happy! But give me 
back my daughter, Chryseis. Take this gold and give me back Chryseis. 
Second Soldier. Give him back his daughter. 
Fourth Soldier. He is a good old man. 
Fifth Soldier. Besides, he is Apollo’s priest. 
Sixth Soldier. Let him have the girl. 
All. Give back Chryseis. 
Agantemnon. Be off with you, old man! Come no more among my hol- 
low ships. I will carry your daughter far away from her native land, to 
Argos, where she shall serve me as my slave. Many a weary hour shall she 
sit at the loom and weave the tiresome time away. And she shall spread 
my bed and grind at the mill. So be off with you before I grow more angry. 
Achilles. Tit will come of this, Agamemnon. 
(Chryses turns to go. He lifts his hands and prays.) 
Chryses. O Apollo, lord of the silver bow, giver of light, god that rulest 
over Chryse, hear me! If ever by word or deed I have gladdened thy heart, 
or if ever J have built a temple in honor of thy name, fulfill my wish! Let 
thy death-bringing arrows fly fast against these scornful Greeks. Let them 
suffer as I suffer for my daughter. 
ACT II 
(The same place as in Act. I, The warriors come walking sadly in.) 
Agamemnon, For nine days Apollo’s arrows have been flying thick 
upon us. Many men have died. We shall all perish under the plague. Is 
there no one here who can tell us why it is that Apollo is angry at us? 
Calchas. O Agamemnon, I am a prophet of the gods, and I can tell. 
It is because we have taken Chryseis away against her father’s will, and the 
priest of Apollo has prayed to the god for revenge upon us, and Apollo has 
granted his prayer. Therefore, the plague has come upon us. If you will 
give up your slave, Agamemnon, Apollo will shut his quiver and return to 
Olympus, and we shall escape from his wrath. 
Agamemnon. Speaker of evil! Never yet have you told me a thing 
that was pleasant. And now you lay commands upon me! I must give up 
my prize for the sake of an old man! But I will keep her! 
Calchas. Then beware the wrath of the god! You and your army will 
die beneath his death-dealing arrows. 
Agamemnon. She was my prize. (Soldiers mutter.) Yet I will give 
her back, if that is better. I cannot see my people perish, But shall I go 
without any prize? Make me ready some other gift. 
Achilles. How shall we give you a prize now? They have all been given 
out to the men. Shall we go begging them back? Wait until we capture 
another town, and we will give you three times your share. 
Agamemnon. I will not wait so long for my prize. Yours I will have. 
Beware, Achilles, I will come to your hut and take Briseis and keep her! 
Achilles. Dog-face and heart of a deer! (Draws sword. Soldiers pre- 
vent his striking Agamemnon. He grows more calm and thrusts back his 
sword.) I will not slay you, but I will speak my word unto you. Fight 
your own battles if you can. I have fought them for you long enough.
-P-A-G-E-36
YER Boox 35 
Capture your own cities and win your own prizes. I will not belong to an 
army led by a coward. I will go back to my ships and watch your brave 
deeds. And hereafter deep longing for Achilles will come upon the Greeks. 
And you will not be able to save them when multitudes fall dying before 
man-slaying Hector. Then you will tear your heart because you did dishonor 
to Achilles. (He walks out, followed by Patroclus and a few others.) 
ACT III 
(in Achilles’ hut. Achilles is playing his lyre. Patroclus is listening. 
They are both unhappy.) 
Patroclus, What weary, dragging days! To hear the good din of bat- 
tle and be held back from the fray like a dog in leash! O Achilles, let us 
go and help our comrades! 
Achilles (singing). 
*Oh! I’m thinking of Hellas, of far-away Hellas, 
Where the green hills are lying, 
Where the sunlight is dying, 
On the far-stretching fields of my Hellas, 
Oh! I’m thinking of Hellas, of far-away Hellas, 
Where the waters are flowing, 
Where the cattle are lowing 
On the wide, sunlit fields of my Hellas, 
My far-away Hellas. 
(He looks out through the door.) There are some of my old friends, 
the Greeks. I see my old teacher, Phcenix. Odysseus and Ajax ‘are with 
him, and there afe two heralds. They must have some message for me. 
What can it be? (Ajax, Odysseus and Phoenix enter.) Welcome to my 
hut, my friends. It is long since I have seen you. 
Ajax, It is pleasant to see your brave face again. 
Phoenix. Ah, how good it is to be under your roof once more, Achil- 
les. : 
Achilles. Patroclus, mix a sweet drink and spread rugs on the chairs. 
Make ready a feast. The dearest of men are these that are under my roof. 
Oh, I am glad to see you again, my friends. What is the news of the 
camp? . 
Ajax, It is in a sad plight. Many of our best warriors have been 
. killed. 
Odysseus. Hector is raging like a lion. He says he will break into our 
camp and burn our huts and our ships. 
Ajax. The Trojan army is camped under our walls. 
Achilles. That is sad news. : 
Phoeniz. The Trojans have driven us inside our walls and have 
camped before our gates. 
(Slaves bring in tables of food. Men feast and talk.) 
Achilles. I see you are wearing a new sword belt, Ajax. 
*See page 91 in Year Book for 1912.
-P-A-G-E-37
36 Franois W. Parker ScHoon 
Ajax. Yes. The armies were resting the other day. Hector came out 
and called for a Greek to fight a duel with him. Se we drew lots, and I 
was chosen. After a long fight the heralds came between and stopped us 
because it was growing dark. Then Hector said: “Ajax you are the best 
of the Greeks, now that Achilles is gone. Will you wear my sword belt in 
memory of our duel?” So he gave me his belt, and I gave him mine. I am 
proud to carry such a brave warrior’s sword. 
Achilles. Tell me more of that duel. 
Ajax, We fought hard and long. I gave Hector a wound, and his 
spear went to the last layer of my shield, but there it stopped and broke. 
When our spears were gone, we fought with great stones. I threw a heavy 
rock at Hector and struck him to the ground. Then the heralds stopped us. 
Achilles. That was a brave fight! I wish I might have lent a hand! 
Phoenix. We have only a little food in the Greek camp now. The 
Trojans have kept us so busy fighting that we have had no time to go for- 
aging. 
Odysseus. We have feasted here to our heart’s desire. But our thoughts 
are not now upon. delicious food. Fear has come upon us in the Greek 
camp. The Trojan fires are burning below our wall, and Hector has 
passed his word to smite off the beaks of our ships and to burn the hulls. 
I am sore afraid in my heart that the gods will grant his boast. I fear it 
is fated for us to perish here in Troy-land, far from Hellas. Up, then, 
Achilles, if you are minded at last to save the failing sons of the -Greeks. 
. If you do not, you will grieve hereafter, and when the ill is done there is 
‘no way to find a cure. Remember what your father said on that day when 
he sent you to Troy: “My son, the gods have given you strength, but do 
not on that account keep a proud heart in your breast. . Gentleness is bet- 
ter.” Swallow your anger now at last, and come and help us. Hear what 
Agamemnon promises you. Seven tripods you shall have and ten talents of 
gold and twenty steaming caldrons, and twelve stalwart horses that have 
won prizes in the race, and seven women slaves, and Briseis, also, he will 
give back. And if we win Troy and return home, you shall have his daugh- 
ter for wife, and he will make you king of seven cities, But if Agamemnon 
is hateful to your heart, take pity on your friends. They will honor you 
like.a god. 
Achilles. Hateful to me are these gifts, and Agamemnon himself is not 
worth a straw. Many a day have we warriors captured towns, while he 
lay safely in his huts, and we have brought home the spoils to him. And 
why must we make this war? The Trojans have done me no harm. More- 
over, slaves are to be had for the capturing, and horses and tripods for the 
buying, but man’s life, when once it is gone, you cannot buy back. My god- 
dess-mother has told me that if I stay here and fight I shall never see again 
my native city or my old father, but shall die here. Tomorrow I will launch 
my ships on the salt sea, and if Poseidon grant me good journey, in three 
days I shall see home and clasp my father’s knees. Phoenix, friend of my 
youth, come with me. Come and see the beautiful hills of Hellas again and 
the clear-flowing streams. My old father is waiting anxiously for your re- 
turn and mine.

Phoenix. O Achilles, you make me sad, reminding me of your old 
father, my king, and of the beautiful hills of Hellas. And I should hate to 
be buried in this terrible Trojan land. I will go. 
Ajax. Odysseus, let us go. We must tell the news to the Greeks, who 
now sit waiting. Achilles is a stubborn man, and his proud heart cares noth- 
ing for his comrade’s love, though they worship him above all the othér men 
among the ships. (Ajax and Odysseus go.) 
ACT IV 
(Achilles and a companion are watching the fight from the Myrmidon 
camp.) 
Achilles. The Trojans are pushing the Greeks into the ‘water! Fight, 
fight, all you Greeks! 
Soldier. They are burning Agamemnon’s ship! 
Achilles. Where is Diomedes and his raging spear? I do not hear 
Agamemnon’s hated voice. Only the war-cry of man-slaying Hector bursts 
around me. 
Soldier. Ajax! Throw your spear, Ajax! (Patroclus enters, running.) 
Patroclus. O Achilles, be no longer wroth with the Greeks. Be mer- 
ciful unto-them. All the bravest warriors lie in the hollow ship, smitten by 
spear or sword—Odysseus and strong Diomedes and kingly Agamemnon. 
And here sits Achilles, nursing his wrath! 
Achilles. I will not go! 
Patroclus. Pitiless that you are! Surely, Peleus is not your father, nor 
gentle Thetis your mother. Your father is but a sheer cliff, and the gray 
sea is your mother, so hard is your heart. May such wrath never take hold 
of me! But at least, send me forth in your place, and let the hosts of the 
Myrmidons follow in the hope of bringing some help to the Greeks, sore 
pressed as they are. Let me have your armor to buckle upon my shoulders, 
so, perhaps, the Trojans will think that Achilles comes, and will fly, and 
the wearied sons of the Greeks may take breath. 
Achilles. So it shall be! Fall on mightily and ward off destruction 
from the Greeks. Yet go not too far, lest the Trojans surround you. (He 
prays.) O far-seeing Zeus, lord of the thunder-bolt, hear me. Guard Pa- 
troclus in battle and grant that he may drive the Trojans far from the 
hollow ships. O mighty Zeus, strengthen his heart and send him safely 
back to me, crowned with victory. * * * Now haste, Patroclus, and may 
the gods help you! (Patroclus goes.) He looks like a great warrier. He 
will surely carry victory to the Greeks, How the Myrmidons crowd about 
him! They are hungry for battle. . 
Soldier. He is at the wall. How the Greeks wave their spears in wel- 
come! The Trojans run from your armor, Achilles, 
Achilles. And there is the arm of a man within the armor. How he 
lays on! Not so far, Patroclus! The Trojans will surround you. Hector 
comes! Beware! Your shield, Patroclus! Where are you? I can no longer 
see you, Patroclus. Patroclus, Patroclus! (Messenger enters, running.) 
Messenger. O Achilles, I bring sad news concerning the man you love. 
Hector has killed Patroclus and is stripping him of his armor.

clus! Coward that I am! There he is lying on the cold ground, and I 
stand here. Patroclus, Patroclus! (He runs out.) 
Soldier. Now, woe unto Hector, the slayer of the well-beloved Patro- 
clus! . 
ACT V 
(Achilles enters from battle. Two soldiers follow him.) 
Achilles. Ah{ I have had my revenge on Hector for killing Patroclus 
and many other brave Greeks. He shall no longer rage in battle. He shall 
burn no more. hollow ships. He shall never have a great mound built over 
him, but dogs shall gnaw his bones. 
First Soldier (to Second Soldier.) How fiercely burns Achilles’ anger! 
Second Soldier. I fear he will do shame to Hector’s body. 
First Soldier. He will never rest until he brings Priam low. 
Second Soldier. But now we may win the battle, since Hector is dead. 
(Priam enters and falls at Achilles’ feet.) 
Achilles. Who is this? Is it Priam, King of Troy? 
Priam. So they called me once. 
Achilles. How did you dare, old man, to come alone to the ships of 
the Greeks, and to meet the eyes of the man who has slain so many of your 
sons? 
Priam. For Hector’s sake I came. 
Achilles. Speak not of Hector! °* 
Priam. Think of your father, O Achilles. He | is of the same years 
with me, on the pathway of old age. Yet while he hears of you as yet 
alive he rejoices in his heart, and he hopes day after day to see his dear son 
returning from Troy-land. But my Hector I shall never see again striding 
through the gates of Troy. Be pitiful on me, for I am longing for my dear 
son, Give him back to me! 
Achilles. Nay, your Hector is dead, killed by my arm for the slaying 
of Patroclus. 
Priam, Surely revenge will not follow into the land of the dead! I 
would only have his body, that we who loved him may weep over it. He 
was my well-beloved son. Think of your father’s tears. 
Achilles. Nay, sit here, and we will let our sorrows lie quiet in our 
hearts, for I am minded to give Hector back to you. 
Priam. Now may the gods bless the mighty Achilles, who hardened not 
his heart against an old man’s sorrow! 
» Achilles, And you would, perhaps, honor him with funeral games, and 
would cuit down trees of the forest for his pyre, and would pile a great 
mound above him. For nine days I will hold back the army of the Greeks, 
that you may have your fill of mourning. 
Priam. Now who would have thought that Achilles would do a favor 
to an old man with white hair? What lying man has called Achilles. proud, 
and hard of heart, and unforgiving? Lo, he has poured out pity upon a 
sore heart.

PREPARATION OF AN EXERCISE ON HISTORICAL METHODS 
IN ARITHMETIC 
  
This material was collected without any purpose of using it as a 
morning exercise. The Russian-peasant method of multiplying with- 
out the use of the multiplication table was first tried with the children 
of the fifth grade and on several adults. With Miss Hall’s hearty in- 
terest to welcome it, the fifth grade visited the fourth grade and spent 
a period in demonstrating it to them. The interest the children 
showed was sufficient to encourage me to present the lattice method to 
the fifth grade. Each of these methods was used comparatively, the 
same multiplication being performed, first by the usual method, then 
by the Russian-peasant method, and thirdly by the lattice method. 
Each method tested the other methods. No pupil ventured to hand in 
work that did not prove. We improved in accuracy rapidly. 
The children liked the work and asked for other methods of 
division. I showed them the scratch method or galley method. This 
forms an intermediate method between the short division and the 
long division. I believe it helped very materially in making plain the 
essential thought-work of division, which is the same in short divi- 
sion, scratch division and long division. 
By this time the children began to expect that I could give them 
still other methods that would be as interesting and they asked for 
more. I showed them the method of multiplying by complements. I 
showed them a few magic squares, how to tell whether a number is 
divisible by 2; 3, 5, 9, or 10, without actually dividing it, and lastly I 
showed them the method of proof of all four operations by casting out 
the 9’s. 
Out of this interest and much willing practice, the children 
secured a large amount of familiarity with the number combina- 
tions and considerable skill in calculation. 
It was at this stage that I proposed to them to make a morning 
exercise of it. They had already been telling their parents about the 
Russian-peasant method at home. I found some of them paying bet- 
ter attention in class when they realized for the first time that they 
could not go home and get father or mother to show them “how.” It 
was necessary in preparation for the morning exercise to impress on 
them the need of speaking clearly, slowly, and of pointing to figures 
as they referred to them. The whole class was prepared, and any of 
“them could have done any of the exercises. The day chosen for the 
39
-P-A-G-E-41
40 Franois W. Parker ScHooi 
exercise was Friday, Jan. 8rd. The week before the holiday vacation, 
I gave a test to the whole class. All but about six had everything 
correct. I did not choose the best pupils to take part in the exercise. 
I chose those who, as I thought, needed it. They were definitely told 
the second school day before the exercise was given. 
The day before the exercise and the morning of the exercise, I 
took the children to the assembly hall to get used to speaking in the 
large room. While the janitors were placing the chairs I had the 
weak whisperers try to speak above the noise and confusion, as Demos- 
‘thenes did at the seashore. While they could not be heard half way 
across the room, it did them much good to test their voices under such 
conditions. They were in excellent good humor and mettle for the 
exercise. 
' ‘The following is a report of the morning exercise as it was given. 
Comparative Methods in the Fundamental Operations 
Dr. Lukens. We are going to show you other ways of multiplying and 
dividing than the usual ways that are taught. It is not at all to be under- 
stood that these are offered as better ways, but they are interesting; they 
help us by comparison to understand better the usual ways, and they serve

The first column is obtained by taking successively half of the number 
above. The second column is obtained by doubling each number successively 
to correspond with the quantities in the first column. You then cross out 
every line that corresponds to an even number in the first column. You 
‘add the rest of the second column and thus obtain the product of the 
two numbers. 
The first column is the control-column and has nothing else to do with 
the product. You do not add it. You take half of each number successively, 
rejecting any fraction, and writing only the whole numbers. Whenever the

remaining numbers in the second column. Their sum is the product of the 
original numbers. .

Halloween, Tam going to use the scratch method of division in dividing 
8,794 by 35. 
The main point is to keep the columns correct. The divisor is written 
below the dividend, and the remainders above the dividend. Both are 
scratched as fast as they are used. Thus, 2 times 3 are 6, and 6 from 8 
leaves 2, written above the 8; 2 times 5 are 10, and 10 from 27 leaves 17, 
written above the 27. The divisor is then moved over one place toward 
the right. Then, 35 is contained in 179 five times, and we say 5 times 3 are 
15, and 15 from 17 leaves 2, written above the 7; 5 times 5 are 25, and 25 
from 29 leaves 4, written above the 9. The divisor is rewritten one place
-P-A-G-E-43

to the right. Then 85 is con- 
tained in 44 once. We say 3 from 
4 leaves 1, written above the 4, 
5 from 14 leaves a remainder of 
9. The numbers are canceled or 
scratched as soon as used, so as 
to keep clear what number one is 
working with at any moment and 
to prevent confusion, 
‘William, Emily and Cony now 
did an example, one by short 
division, one by scratch division, 
and one by long division, to show 
that the operation in the mind is 
exactly the same in all division, 
but that in the short division only 
the quotient is written; in scratch 
division the remainders and the 
quotient; and in long division all 
is written, products, remainders 
and quotients.

PREPARATION OF AN EXERCISE ON THE GREAT ICE SHEET 
  
A. geography exercise was given by the fifth grade, comparing 
the present winter’s snow sheet with the Great Ice Sheet of the Glacial 
Epoch. 
The preparation of this morning exercise was radically different 
from that of the exercise on historical methods in arithmetic. Here 
I had already spoken to the children about the exercise a month in 
advance; told them what I proposed to have them do; and described 
  CUT-OUT MAP OF SNOW SHEET 
to them the material I proposed to use. They had been chalking out 
on the floor map* the boundary of the winter ice and snow sheet: as 
shown from week to week by the Ice and Snow Bulletin. I proposed 
*The floor of the class room is covered with linoleum in which is worked out a 
map of the northern half of the western htmisphere from the equator northward on a

cities, etc., are marked by tack heads of different shapes and sizes. The water is 
painted in blue and drainage features in different colors. One use for this outline 
map is to chalk in temporarily any historical, scientific, commercial, or geographical data.

to them to use a large wall map for the morning exercise, with a cut- 
out flap to hang down from the top of the map to cover as much of 
the map as the snow did of the country. I proposed to them to make 
a comparison between the annual snow sheet and the Great Ice Sheet 
of geologic times and to point out clearly wherein they are similar, 
and just as clearly wherein they are totally unlike. 
We proceeded with the preparation of the material and added. a 
cut-out map of the snow sheet for each week through the winter. 
We had no date assigned for the exercise until we were sure of 
the material. A sudden emergency, a few days later, that prevented 
the giving of a high-school morning exercise, offered us a date two 
weeks earlier than before had been chosen. We had but two days’ 
notice of the change, but the weather furnished the setting that we 
needed. The snow sheet was still on the ground, the floods were 
attracting everyone’s attention to the Ohio valley, and the snow was 
still nearly four feet deep in northern Michigan. The exercise given 
was as reported below. 
The Great Ice Sheet 
Mary. This weekly Snow and Ice Bulletin* shows the present winter’s 
snow sheet. There are three places where the snow coliects the deepest: 
Maine and New York, the northern peninsula of Michigan, and the Rocky 
Mountains. On March 18, in Maine the snow was 19 inches deep, in New 
York 8 inches, in Michigan 41 inches, and in the Rocky Mountains 14 inches. - 
This printed part down below tells where the storms are, and this table’ 
telis how deep the ice is in the rivers. 
Lee. The Great Ice Sheet came many thousands of years ago. The 
edge of the Ice Sheet was along the Ohio and the Missouri rivers. These 
(bointing to diagram) are the three great centers where the ice was thick- 
est. This one is called the Labrador, this the Keewatin, and this the Cordil- 
leran Ice Sheet. : 
There are many traces of the Ice Sheet around Chicago. One is the 
great granite boulders that the Ice Sheet brought down from Canada. On _ 
the rocks at Stony Island there are scratches and grooves that the ice made 
as it passed over that region. The terminal moraine is another trace. This 
moraine was formed of earth deposited at the edge of the ice. The edge 
of the Ice. Sheet stayed for many years at the same place, and all the earth 
that was brought down. in the ice collected there, and so that formed the 
moraine. 
Halloween. This morning some of the fifth-grade children are going 
to take this winter’s snow sheet in cémparison with the Ice Sheet of Jong 
ago. The Great Ice Sheet was thousands of feet thick. This winter’s snow 
sheet varies from inches to a few feet. These two charts show the extent

and depth of this winter’s snow sheet, and the extent and movement of the 
Great Ice Sheet at the period of its greatest extent. The farthest that the 
Ice Sheet ever came is right along here (pointing to the diagram). 
When the snow sheet extends 
further than the Ice Sheet ex- 
tended, it is not very deep. 
Theresa, The material of both 
the winter snow sheet and the 
Great Ice Sheet that came long 
ago is snow. Thousands of years 
ago, at the time of the Ice Sheet, 
it snowed very heavily, and as it 
was always cold, there was no 
chance for the snow to melt, and 
that is how an ice sheet was 
formed. Here is a chart of the 
Ice Sheet. Here is where the snow 
sheet was melting back. On March 
18th the snow had melted back quite 
a little. Down here in Texas is the 
farthest it came at any time this 
winter. In here there was an 
island of bare land with no snow 
on it. The first chart is for De- : 
cember 10th, and the snow came MAP OF GREAT ICE SHEET 
down only a little way over the Great Lakes region. You can see over 
here that Cape Cod was never covered with snow. Down in Texas 
it was not very deep, but the Great Lakes region was always covered. 
The places where it was deepest were in -Maine, Northern Michigan _ 
and the Rocky Mountains. At places in the Rocky Mountains there is 
snow almost all the year around. - 
Carolyn. As the winter snow sheet retreats, the birds that have gone 
south come back, and the animals come back. The Ice Sheet retreated in the 
same way that the winter snow sheet does. When the Ice Sheet came, the 
birds went south too. As the Ice Sheet retreated, some plants came back and 
are still on their way north. Some of the trees and other plants that used 
to grow about here grown now in the Hudson Bay country. When the Ice 
Sheet retreated, the Ohio, the Mississippi, and the Missouri rivers were de- 
veloped by the great amount of water from the melting ice. 
Theresa. 1 forgot to say that the Ice Sheet and the snow sheet extend 
from the south pole in a similar way as from the north pole. 
Lucile. This is a map of the United States, and shows the snow sheet 
for this winter only. (This was a cut-out chart showing, by a series of cut 
maps lying one over the othr, the weekly changes in the snow sheet for the 
present winter. See the first cut in this article.) 
Allan (pointing to the Ice Sheet Map). The Tce Sheet, on the other

hand, lasted many thousands of years. Since it lasted year after year, it 
grew much thicker than the snow sheet that lasts only for one winter. 
Lucile (showing diagrams). These curves show the depth of snow 
in the Michigan Peninsula, in Colorado, and in Maine, from week to week 
throughout the winter.

_. Allan. The immense thickness of the Ice Sheet made it flow because the 
pressure of the ice pushed it out from the middle, and it flowed in all direc- 
tions, and while it flowed it grew thicker. It would go over mountains 
and take the top off and carry the earth and boulders and dirt and things 
and would pile them, up in the valleys, and make rivers and lakes. On our 
class excursions we have seen boulders that have come down from Canada 
in the ice. 
Lucile, Instead of making lakes, as the Ice Sheet did, ihe snow melts

and leaves ponds and pools that last only a few days. The mud that has 
been mixed up with the snow covers everything outdoors, and the streets 
have to be cleaned, but the snow cannot carry the mud any great distance. 
Allan. No plants could grow in the country covered by the Ice Sheet, 
and the animals could not get food, and they had to go south, and when it 
retreated, they came north again. This northward retreat is still going on 
now. There are lots of plants and animals that are away up in Canada now, 
whose ancestors used to be around here. 
Lucile. Some birds and animals go south each winter when the snow 
sheet comes. There are plants, annuals, that are killed during the winter, 
but they come up again from the seeds. Others do not die out, perennials, 
and, when the snow goes, then the birds and other animals come north 
again. 
Dr, Lukens, This completes our exercise, but there are some parts of 
it that did not come out, although most of the points we had in mind have 
been presented. It has been our intention. for some weeks to have an exercise 
on the Ice Sheet before the snow went away from this region. The re- 
treat of the snow sheet has presented itself this spring in a very striking 
way in Indiana, Iowa, and Ohio. The terrific catastrophe of this year is a 
vivid example of those that occurred as the Ice Sheet retreated. The com- 
parison between the Ice Sheet and snow sheet is very suggestive. We do not 
find this enlarged upon in the books. The comparison that is enlarged 
upon by the geologists is between glaciers and the Ice Sheets. The latter is 
frequently called a glacier. Now, it differs just as radically from a glacier 
as it does from the snow sheet, and the difference needs to be understood. 
I have chosen this morning’s exercise to show the neglected comparison be- 
tween the snow sheet and the Ice Sheet. The essential difference is that the 
snow sheet does not flow as the Ice Sheet did. If you bear that one differ- 
ence in mind you may think of the Ice Sheet as a great perennial snow sheet. 
The materials are the same and came in the same way, but the Ice Sheet 
Jasted longer. This is the real cause of the difference. The Ice Sheet car- 
ried earth material with it, and with this it mantled the land and filled the 
valleys and scraped off the tops of mountains and blocked up valleys already 
there. This action of the ice in motion can be studied best by observing the 
glaciers of the present. 
Halloween. 1 forgot to say that the seasonal climate changes here about 
every day or so, but in the days of the Ice Sheets the changes were by the 
thousand years—about a thousand years. of bad weather and a thousand 
years of good weather. 
Macaulay (sixth grade). Do you know when we will have another Ice 
Sheet? 
Dr. Lukens. We must first know what caused this Ice Sheet. If we 
find out what caused that, we can probably say when it will return. The 
theories are so uncertain that it is better not to deal with them at all. The 
theory that has the most confidence at the present time, is that the variation 
of climate is due to the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The amount of 
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere determines its power to take and retain
-P-A-G-E-49
48 Franors W. Parker ScHoon 
the heat from the sun’s rays as they pass through it. As the sun’s rays pass 
through space no heat is taken, but as they reach the atmosphere of the 
earth, it acts as a net to catch and absorb the heat. Carbon dioxide in- 
creases very much the power of the atmosphere to absorb the sun’s rays. A 
slight depletion in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would 
suffice to produce a profound change of climate. 
Miss Leubrie. What about the theory of the change of the axis of the 
earth? 
Dr. Lukens. The axis of the carth is wobbling in a cycle of several 
thousand years, and this might account for the difference in climate. If 
the axis of the earth were more nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic, it would 
be much colder at the poles. We would perhaps have said that the greatest 
ice sheet at present is around the south pole—the ice sheet that has been 
explored by Shackleton, Ross, and Scott. That ice sheet covers the entire 
Antarctic continent. In the north, the greatest ice sheet is in Greenland. 
There we can study the ice sheet growing to great thickness in the interior. 
Greenland is without vegetation, except along the coast, the snow and ice 
covering the entire land. 
Miss Leubrie, Wallace’s “Island Life” is a classical work on this sub- 
ject. 
Miss Cooke. The melting of the snow sheet has brought about a great 
deal of suffering this year, especially to some of our neighbors in Indiana, 
Ohio, and Nebraska, and there has been a call from the United Charities for 
help. Men, women, and children are almost without clothing. Money also 
is needed. Bring tomorrow any help that you want to give, whether in 
clothing or money. I know, of course, that at Thanksgiving and Christmas 
you gave all the clothing you could spare, but perhaps some has accumu- 
lated since. The United Charities have facilities by which they can get 
things to places where needed.

PREPARATION OF AN EXERCISE ON THE AGE OF 
ELIZABETH 
  
Seven cities claim the bones of Homer. In this book more. than 
seven kinds of claims are made for the morning exercise as an aid to 
teaching. I wish to urge that there is no better means of teaching 
formal English composition. And when I have shown the oppor- 
tunity it affords for study of introduction, conclusion, paragraph- 
ing, dignity and adequacy of vocabulary, unity, and so on, I must 
present an example, reported verbatim, which you can fairly say 
illustrates none of these points. However, I may ask fellow teachers 
to remember that the participants in a morning exercise can by no 
means be those who least need the training—who would, in other 
words, do creditably all they are expected to do; and that, however 
clearly a boy may know what the girl who is to precede him is going 
to say, and how he must join his paragraph to hers, he may fail to 
make the easy connection when his turn comes; and further, that 
such a failure is immeasurably preferable to his committing to mem- 
ory what he plans to say, instead of speaking easily out of abundant 
information, even though we find that his performance falls far short 
of his promise. 
This eighth-grade history class had spent two or three weeks on 
the Tudor period, especially the reign of Elizabeth. The same children 
had caught a faint glimpse of its literary glories by a careful study 
through many weeks of “As You Like It.” They had presented two 
scenes from the play, in costume. They had all read parts of “West- 
ward-Ho,” and knew the daring of the English seaman, his scorn of 
Spain, his hot Protestantism. Some of the class had read “Kenil- 
worth,” and given the rest a picture of the splendor of the time. They 
had studied “The Revenge,” and read selections from historical plays 
of Shakespeare which breathed the spirit of those days. 
Elizabeth’s reign interested different pupils in different ways, but 
they could all see that an exercise of this type, to be effective, should 
have one unifying idea. Everyone had a suggestion as to what this 
jdea should be, and they settled upon “The pride which the English- 
man of that day had in his country.” Then everybody made an 
outline. I need scarcely mention that children making such a plan 
49
-P-A-G-E-51
50 Franois W. PARKER SCHOOL 
feel that it is their enterprise, and that their best energies are engaged 
to make it of value. In this frame of mind they readily evolved the 
idea that an exercise with a dominant thought must at the outset 
arrest the attention of the audience with a vivid presentation of that 
thought; also that one way to conclude such an exercise is to remind 
the audience of that first impression, and send them away with the 
unifying idea uppermost in ‘their minds. When they had adopted 
these two principles, I could trust to them for suggestions for a good 
introduction and an effectively resumptive ending. In the exercise in 
question, the selections from historical plays came to their aid, but of 
course that is a rare occurrence. 
Then as to paragraphs. A change of speaker in the exercise cor- 
responds to a new paragraph ina theme. Highth-grade pupils have 
few occasions to write any composition of sufficient length to enable 
them to practice paragraphing adequately, just as the brevity of 
their ordinary compositions precludes their using careful introduc- 
tions and conclusions. From such an exercise as this, planned so 
that each speaker treats a new aspect of the subject, they acquire a 
working knowledge of the principle of paragraphing. 
A third principle of composition also is made necessary in an 
exercise of this type. Every speaker, while introducing a new branch 
of the subject, must avoid making his transitions too abrupt. Read- 
ing of a good prose model shows that careful writers avoid such 
abruptness by the repetition of a word or phrase from the preceding 
paragraph, or by a connecting word, like such, but, however, or some 
other device. Each participant was expected by the class to plan his 
transition. He was expected also to keep the vocabulary of his para- 
graph up to the standard set by Shakespeare in the introductory read- 
ing, and this modest demand he did his utmost to meet. The exer- 
cise follows:

Elisabeth. Shakespeare, who wrote the lines Estabrook has just read, 
was the greatest writer of his time. He lived in the days of Queen Eliza- 
beth, and tried to express for the men of his time their boundless love for 
England and their pride in it. The Englishmen had reason to be proud, 
for Spain had been the leading power of the world, and they had defeated the 
Spanish Armada and made England mistress of the seas. This great struggle 
was brought about by a number of causes. England was almost without 
exception Protestant, and Spain was entirely Catholic. The English had 
been helping the Protestants in France and the Netherlands, which made 
Spain very angry. Then the English had been doing a great wrong by 
cruising in the Spanish Main, and capturing richly laden Spanish galleons 
from the Indies. Also Mary Queen of Scots left her claim to the English 
throne to Philip of Spain, which made him resolve to conquer England and 
make himself King. So he got ready his ships, and after three years of care- 
ful preparation the greatest fleet the world had ever seen sailed out of the 
Spanish harbor toward England. 
England had had a long period of peace, and was poorly supplied with 
ships and men, but as soon as she heard of Spain’s plan she gathered all the 
old vessels she had and fitted them up as best she could. Lord Howard was 
made commander, and he and his men had hope and confidence and were 
willing to sacrifice themselves for their queen. 
The Armada was first sighted off the coast of Plymouth, sailing in a 
crescent of a hundred and forty ships. The small English fleet of seventy 
ships immediately started out in pursuit. They gained rapidly on the Span- 
ish fleet, and soon were close enough to fire upon them. The Spanish at once 
fired back, and a fierce battle ensued, in which both sides showed great cour- 
age. The English had the advantage, for their ships were so light and swift 
that they could dodge the shots of the Spaniards, while the Spanish ships 
were so big and top-heavy that they rocked violently, so that the shots went 
far up into the air. That day the English shot off 500 cannon, while the 
Spaniards thought they were doing wonders in shooting eighty. This indi- 
cates that the English were more practiced in the navy. The Spaniards had 
foolishly crowded their ships with inexperienced noblemen who had little 
idea of how to fight, while the English had put as few men as possible on 
board, and these men skilled in battle. When the Spaniards saw that the 
English were defeating them, they lost their courage and hope, and sailed 
toward France, to take refuge in the harbor of Calais. There they had 
‘planned to meet a Spanish duke with a trained army.
-P-A-G-E-53
52 Francis W. Parker Scuoou 
If the English had not kept their eyes upon them, the Spaniards would 
Probably have landed on the shores of England and a battle on land would 
have followed, but at midnight the English sent four fire ships into the har- 
bor to destroy the Armada. The men were all on shore, and when they heard 
of what was going on they were horrified and flew to their ships. The next 
morning, almost half of the Spanish Armada was destroyed and another ter- 
rible battle followed. As soon as the Spaniards could. escape they tried to 
get back to Spain around, the northern coast of England, but a terrible 
storm arose, and nearly all of the ships were destroyed. The English, also, 
were almost starved to death before they could get back to England to tell 
of their joyful victory. 
Macaulay, The English at the time of Elizabeth were great sailors and 
fighters. This is proved in such a case as Sir Francis Drake, who was the 
first Englishman to go around the world; so also in the case of Sir Walter 
Raleigh, who was a great fighter and sailor. A good example of the char- 
acter of the English sea captain of that day is shown in Sir Richard Gren- 
ville, captain of the “Revenge.” The Revenge is the little English ship that 
all but defeated fifty of the great Spanish men-of-war. The “Revenge” is 
well known to most of us. Lord Tennyson wrote it. I am going to read 
some passages in which Sir Richard speaks to his men: 
“Shall we fight, or shall we fly? 
Good Sir Richard, tell us now, 
For to fight is but to die. 
There'll be little of us left by the time this sun is set.” 
And Sir Richard said again: “We be all good Englishmen. 
Let us hang these dogs of Seville, the children of the devil, 
For I never turned my back upon Don or devil yet.” 
This shows the great hatred that the English had for the Spaniards. It 
also shows the good fellowship that existed between the English officers and 
their men. On the Spanish ships the men were divided into three classes— 
sailors, gunners, and officers, The sailors were treated very cruelly. The 
_ gunners were most of them foreigners, and the officers knew no fighting but 
to draw the sword. The next passage is where they fought a day and a 
night: 
But Sir Richard cried in his English pride, 
“We have fought such a fight for a day and a night 
As may never be fought again. 
We have won great glory, my men; 
And a day less or more, 
At sea or ashore, 
We die—does it matter when? 
Sink me the ship, Master Gunner,—sink her, split her in twain; 
Fall into the hands of God, not into the hands of Spain.” 
This shows the great pride that the English had; they would rather sink 
their own ship than surrender to the Spaniards and have them boast that 
they had done it. Sir Richard Grenville wanted to sink the ship, but the
-P-A-G-E-54
Year Book 53 
sailors said no, because they did not want to leave their wives and children, 
so they surrendered to the Spanish sailors on the condition that they would 
let them go again when they got to land. 
Lawrence. Such loyalty to queen and country could only come from wise 
rule, and Elizabeth was a great queen. During her reign, England was at 
peace. A farmer ate what he planted. Before that time his land was 
robbed and laid waste. While England was at peace and other countries 
were at war, England began to prosper. Hofland was the greatest commer- 
cial country in Europe at that time. When King Philip of Spain persecuted 
some of the merchants, the merchants came to England, thus helping England 
to become a great commercial nation. Inventions were growing in number, 
such as beds, pillows, chimneys, forks, and carriages. Before that, instead 
of having beds, men slept on pallets of straw, with their heads on rough logs 
for pillows. People had a hole through the roof for a chimney, and some 
of the smoke stayed in the house. They changed from wooden forks to 
metal forks. The first carriage was introduced into England at that time. 
Before that people had to travel on horseback. People stopped building cas- 
tles, but built instead beautiful mansions, surrounded by parks, because they 
did not need protection, This chart (pointing to the following chart)

  shows the periods of English history, and shows that when the Tudors came 
they tried to build up a despotism. Despotism is a tyranny which all the 
Tudors tried to build up. Despotism is arbitrary taxation, arbitrary legisla- 
tion, arbitrary imprisonment. All these things Henry VIII and Elizabeth were 
guilty of, but she did it for the good of the people. Elizabeth had great 
power in choosing her ministers. The greatest men of England were her 
ministers, like Lord Burleigh. The people did not mind having Queen 
Elizabeth trying to build up a despotism, because she was doing it for the 
good of them. She once said to Parliament, “Nothing, no worldly thing, is 
so good as the love and good will of my subjects.”

at the end she grew to be very unpopular, partly because her old freinds 
had died, and partly because the younger citizens did not understand and like 
her methods of government, which were not then necessary because she had 
used them so successfully. This is a prophecy which Cranmer made at the 
christening of Elizabeth in Shakespeare’s play of “Henry VIII”: 
“This royal infant—heaven still move about her !— 
Though in her cradle, yet now promises 
Upon this land a thousand, thousand blessings, 
Which time shall bring to ripeness. She shall be 
A pattern to all princes living with her, 
And all that shall succeed; Saba was never 
More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue 
Than this pure soul shall be. All princely graces 
That mould up such a mighty piece as this is, 
With all the virtues that attend the good, 
Shall still be doubled on her; truth shall nurse her, 
Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her ; 
She shall be loved and feared; her own shall bless her; 
Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn, 
And hang their heads with sorrow; good grows with her. 
In her days every man shall eat in safety 
Under his own vine what he plants, and sing 
The merry songs of peace to all his neighbors. 
God shall be truly known; and those about her 
From her shall read the perfect ways of honour.”

PREPARATION OF AN EXERCISE ON CICERO 
  
In working on the orations of Cicero, with the Junior class, one 
of the unspoken hopes of the teacher was that the subject-matter of 
the orations, or the allied topics of the political life, oratory, and 
character of the great men of Cicero’s time, would inspire the class 
to evolve a morning exercise that could be given to the pleasure and 
profit of the School. 
It was the general opinion of the class, on finishing the four 
orations against Catiline, that there was material for an exercise 
which could be so simplified as to be interesting to even the fourth- 
grade children. 
The students were asked to work out plans for the exercise, and 
two periods were spent in discussing these outlines and in the organ- 
izing and illustrating of the material. 
Many felt, however, that three exercises, one, depicting the life 
of the Romans at that time, another, giving a glimpse of Cicero, the 
statesman, and a third, presenting the big civic questions involved, 
would be necessary in order to give an adequate setting for the 
orations. : 
The pupils themselves selected the passages from the orations 
that would best present their respective topics in the six minutes 
allowed to each speaker; they made their own translations and planned 
the staging of the senate.scene, keeping in mind the need of adapting 
the presentation to the younger children as well as to the older stu- 
dents and faculty. The class was assisted by the art department in 
designing the costumes and in arranging the setting, and by the 
teacher of oral expression, in the rehearsals of the orations. 
Below are given specimens of three tentative plans prepared by 
the students, and the material in full of the accepted plan as it was 
presented in the morning exercise.

Morning Exercise as Given

of Rome in 63 B, C., and a setting for the orations, is, as stated before, a composite 
that grew from the class discussions. 
Josephine. At the close of the Punic wars, over two thousand years ago, 
Rome was practically the mistress of the known world, but was no longer the 
ruler of her own destinies, for great extremes of wealth and poverty had 
arisen. The prosperous commercial cities had disappeared; and the simple 
middle-class farmer had been forced to give up his home and take refuge 
- in Rome, becoming one of the uneducated mob which had nothing: te do 
but to lie about the streets and fall a prey to unscrupulous politicians. 
Instead of small farms, great estates spread over all Italy, which were owned

by the wealthy Roman nobles and worked by slaves. The only roads to power 
were wealth, birth, and the command of an army. Yet in this time of 
license there lived a man, Marcus Tullius Cicero, a man of no great wealth, 
and not a noble, who, by his brilliant oratory and unusual administrative 
ability, was able to gain the consulship, the highest office in Rome, and to 
crush the great conspiracy of Catiline, which aimed, not only to overthrow the 
government, but even to destroy the city. In Rome, for several centuries, ora- 
tory had played a very important part in the life of the people—much more, 
in fact, than it does today. In Rome, most of the voters lived in the cities, 
and there was no farming class, as in our country, liable to maintain the 
equilibrium between two parties in the political strife. The voters, a small 
minority of the populace, would gather around the orator, who addressed 
them in the central part of the city, in the forum, Questions were submitted 
to the people to vote upon, and matters were not decided by the representa- 
tives of the people, as they are today, but by the voters themselves. It was 
here, as a lawyer, before his consulship, that Cicero won a great many impor- 
tant cases. Some of his most notable speeches were those in defense of Ros- 
cius, and the Phillipics against Verres. Aside from Cicero’s argumentative 
power, he possessed a great influence over the minds and feelings of his audi- 
ence, because of his attractive personality. He had a tall, impressive figure, 
and a strong, sweet voice. In fact, when other lawyers were arguing on the 
same side of a question with Cicero, it was usually Cicero who was the last 
one to address the judges, because of the good impression he always made. 
We know of over. one hundred orations that he actually delivered. Fifty-seven 
of these we have intact, and parts of twenty-four more. But perhaps the 
most famous and most widely read of all Cicero’s orations are those against 
Catiline. 
This Catiline was a nobleman of unusual ability, and he was endowed 
with the rare quality of being able to attract people to him. Yet all of his 
talents and intellect were wasted because in his youth he had always gone 
to every excess, and this had blunted his moral sense. So, when he had 
quickly spent his fortune in trying to retrieve his losses, he was led into a 
series of crimes that were almost beyond belief. 
Catiline was one of Cicero’s opponents in the candidacy for consulship, 
but was beaten three times, and Cicero was elected. Catiline was so furiously 
indignant that he immediately resolved upon revenge. So ne gathered about 
him a band of spendthrifts, criminals and notorious leaders of the city 
mob, who were always ready for bloodshed and excitement. With these men 
he planned the murder of all the leading men in Rome, the overthrow of the 
government, the destruction of the city, if that were necessary, and then to 
make himself ruler. So he straightway gathered an army and supplies in the 
northern part of Italy, and left them under the command of Manlius, one 
of his friends, while he himself remained in Rome to watch operations there. 
On the evening of the 6th of November, Catiline called a meeting of his 
followers at Lacca’s to complete arrangements for the murder of the citi- 
zens. But Cicero had kept careful watch of all of Catiline’s plans, and that 
very evening his friends came to tell him of the great danger. So two days
-P-A-G-E-60
Yuar Book 59 
later, the 8th of November, Cicero calied a meeting of the Senate in the 
Temple of Jupiter Stator, and planned to present to the senators the danger 
that surrounded them, and to make arrangements for active defense, But 
when Cicero perceived that Catiline had had the audacity to come to his 
usual place in the senate, when he knew that he had planned the destruction 
of every man assembled there, Cicero was so furious that, instead of proceed- 
ing with the business as planned, he burst out into a fiery oration, and 
showed Catiline, step by step, that all his plans were known. This oration 
John will now give. 
(Curtain rises.) - 
    
CICERO’S ORATION AGAINST CATILINE 
John. How long, pray, Catiline, will you take advantage of our patience? 
How much longer will you continue to mock us? To what lengths will you 
go in your unbridled audacity? Have not the nightly guard on the Palatine, 
the garrison of the city, the rallying of all loyal men, the meeting of the 
senate in this strongly fortified temple, the expressions on the countenances 
of these men moved you at all? Do you not see that your conspiracy is laid 
“bare? Do you not realize that it is held fast bound by the knowledge that we 
all possess? Who of us, do you suppose does not know what you did fast 
night, the night before, where you were, what men you assembled together, 
what plans you had made? Alas, the times, the customs! The senate 
knows this, the consul sees it; nevertheless, he lives. Lives, do I say? Yea, 
more, he comes even into the senate; he takes part in public affairs; he 
silently marks every man of us for slaughter. 
You ought to have been put to death long ago’ by the consul’s order, 
Catiline; long ago you ought to have received the destruction which you are
-P-A-G-E-61
60 Francis W. Parker SoHoon 
now plotting against us. Did not Publius Scipio, a most distinguished man, 
Pontifex Maximus, put to death Tiberius Gracchus, who was only desirous 
of a change of government? Shall we, the consuls, allow you to live, who 
wish to destroy the whole world with fire and sword? There was once— 
there was once a time, when loyal men thought that a dangerous citizen 
should be more severely punished than the most hostile foe. We have a 
severe and weighty decree of the senate against you, Catiline. We do not 
lack evidence nor the authorization of the senate, but we, I say it openly,— 
we, the consuls, are at fault. You live; and you live not to give up, but to 
persist in your bold acts. Senators, I wish to be lenient; I do not wish to 
be lax at this time of danger to the state—but now I condemn myself for my 
inactivity and negligence. A camp in opposition to the Roman people has 
been pitched in‘the mountain passes ‘of Etruria. The number of the enemy 
increases daily. We see the general, the leader of that camp, within the city 
walls, even within our senate, daily plotting the destruction of the state. But, 
Catiline, you will be put to death when no one so wicked, so_ desperate, so 
like yourself, can be found who does not admit that the deed was justly done. 
As long as there is any one who dares defend you, you will live; and you 
will live just as you are living now, surrounded by my numerous strong 
guards, so that you will not be able to make a single move against the re- 
public. Review with me what you did night before last. You will see that 
I have been much more watchful for the safety of the state than you have 
been for its destruction. I say that you went into the scythe-maker’s quar- 
ters—to be plain—to the house of Marcus Lacca. There you assembled many 
of your mad followers. Do you dare to deny this? Why are you silent? 
I will prove it, if you deny it. Ye immortal gods! Where in the world 
are we? In what city do we live? What kind of a republic is this? Here, 
amongst the senators, in this most august and sacred body, are men who are 
plotting the destruction of us all, of the city, and even of the whole world. 
While you were at Lacca’s that night, Catiline, you portioned out the whole 
of Italy. You chose the men whom you would leave at Rome,’ and those 
men you would lead out with you. You marked out the parts of the city 
that were to be fired, and said that you would set out from the city, but 
that you were delayed a little because I was still living. Two of your friends 
were found who promised to relieve you of that care and to kill me early in 
the morning. I heard of the plan, and saved myself by placing guards 
around my house. Can the light of day, or the air we breathe, be pleasing to 
you, Catiline, when you know that there is no one here who is not fully 
aware that December 31st you got together a band of men to kill the con- 
suls and the chief magistrates of the state, and that not a change of mind 
or fear deterred you, but the fortune of the Roman people? A little while 
ago you came into the senate. Was there any one of this great num- 
ber of men, of all your friends and relatives, who greeted you? Since 
this is the first time in history that this has happened to anyone, are you 
waiting to be insulted openly, when their silence shows the contempt in 
which they hold you? What of this,—that at your arrival these seats be- 
came vacant; that all men of consular rank, as soon as you sat down, left
-P-A-G-E-62
Yzuar Book 61 
that part of the benches empty? And in what spirit, pray, do you think you 
ought to bear this? By heavens, if my slaves feared me as all your fellow 
citizens fear you, Catiline, I should leave my home. Go out from the city, 
Catiline; relieve the state of its fear; set out into exile, if you are waiting 
this word. What is it, Catiline? What are you waiting for? Do you not 
perceive the wishes of these men by their silence? They desire it—they are 
silent. . 
Now, senators, that I may avert a certain just complaint of the father- 
land against me, listen carefully to what I have to say, and let my words 
sink deeply into your hearts and minds. If the fatherland, which is much 
dearer to me than life, if the whole state should speak to me and say: 
“Marcus Tullius Cicero, what are you doing? Will you allow that man, 
who you know is an enemy, who is to be the leader of. the war against us, 
who has aroused the slaves and desperate men against the state, to go out 
of the city unpunished? Will you not rather order him to be thrown into 
prison, and to be put to death? What hinders you from doing this? Is it 
the customs of your ancestors? Is it the law? Do you fear unpopularity in 
. the future?” to the sacred words of the republic and to the men who think 
this, I would answer briefly. If I thought that this were the best thing to 
do, senators, I would not allow that ruffian to live one hour longer, but would 
put him to death, But many men, not only wicked, but even ignorant men, 
would say that I had acted cruelly and tyrannically if I should punish him. 
Now I know that if he goes to the camp of Manlius, as he intends to do, 
there will be no one so stupid as not to see that a conspiracy has been 
formed; no one so wicked as to not admit this. I know that, if he alone is 
killed, the danger will be averted for awhile, but will not be stamped out for 
all time. But if he should lead his wicked followers out with him, not only 
would this fully developed conspiracy be wiped out and destroyed, but even 
the root and seed of all evil. 
I promise you, senators, that the consuls will be so diligent that you 
will have so much power, that there will be such a united and harmonious 
spirit among all Romans, that on Catiline’s departure you will see all things 
laid bare, brought to light, punished. 
Wilt thou, Jupiter, whom we have truly called the guardian of this city 
and empire, keep this man from thy temples, the homes of the city, the pos- 
sessions of the citizens? And wilt thou punish this man, leader of the 
enemy, the foe of the fatherland, a plunderer of Italy, while in life—and 
even after death—with eternal punishment? 
(Curtain falls.) 
Josephine. When Cicero ceased speaking and sat down, Catiline at 
first attempted to reply to the proofs of his guilt, but he was hissed down 
by the senators. Seeing, then, that he was really in danger, he left the tem- 
ple, and, fleeing from the city, that night went.to the cathp of Manlius in the 
northern part of Italy, on the pretense that he had gone to Massalia for his 
health. During the month that ensued Cicero kept careful track of all the 
plans and movements of the conspirators who were left behind in the city;
-P-A-G-E-63
62 Franots W. Parker ScHOoL 
and finally, by getting possession of a letter written to Catiline by Lentulus, 
Cicero felt that he had sufficient evidence to warrant the arrest of the four 
chief conspirators who were then in the city. The following day he called 
a meeting in the temple of Concord to justify himself in the eyes of the 
senators for having arrested the conspirators. As he left the senate house 
people crowded about and clamored to know what was going on. So Cicero 
addressed them, and, going over much the same ground that he had that 
morning, in the senate-house, he showed them, step by step, Catiline’s acts 
and the guilt of the conspirators. 
We should like the School to imagine that they are the Roman people, 
assembled to listen to Cicero’s proofs as he gave them from the rostrum in 
the Forum. 
(Curtain rises.) 
Frances. Fellow citizens! Today you see this far-famed republic, this 
most glorious city, yourselves, your wives, your children, snatched from the 
very jaws of death, preserved and restored to you by my diligence, counter- 
plots, and wisdom, and through the great love * 
of the immortal gods for you. For I have 
quenched the fire that was threatening this 
city, these temples, and your homes, and have 
turned aside the sword of disaster from your 
throats, and have lifted the yoke of servitude 
from off your shoulders. I shall tell you 
briefly how I discovered, prevented, and finally 
disclosed in the senate today this great con- 
spiracy, 
In the first place, when I drove Catiline 
into exile, I thought that his followers would 
be too weak without him to do any serious 
harm, Nevertheless, I have kept a constant 
watch over them, and know everything that 
they have done or even contemplated. I dis- 
covered that legates were being sent into Gaul 
CICERO ADDRESSING PEOPLE to incite the provincials to war, and that Vol- 
turcius, one of the conspirators, had joined himself to this party with letters 
and verbal directions to Catiline. Accordingly, I knew that the time had 
come when I must prove to you and to the senate the perfidy of Catiline 
and of his followers. I confided the plot to two praetors, Flaccus and Pom- 
tinus, and told them what I thought should be done. Being most loyal and 
devoted adherents to the state, they asked no further questions, but each 
procured a force of strong and loyal men; and, without arousing anyone’s 
suspicions, they hid themselves in the farm-houses on opposite sides of the 
river Tiber, near the Mulvian bridge. Early in the morning, when the troup 
of legates, with Volturcius, crossed the bridge, they were attacked and easily 
captured. The despatches to Catiline, with seals intact, were seized and 
handed over to me. I immediately called a meeting of the principal men of 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
Yuar Boor * 63 
the city, and also summoned the four conspirators, Gabinus, Statilius, Cethe- 
gus, and Lentulus,-who came, suspecting nothing. I was advised to open 
the despatches privately, so that in case nothing of importance was found, I 
should not needlessly alarm the senate. But I decided to call the senate to- 
gether and lay the whole matter before them. In the meantime, I sent a 
praetor to search the house of Cethegus. He discovered a great number of 
swords, daggers, and other weapons hidden there. When the senate had 
assembled, Volturcius turried state’s evidence, and I bade him tell all he 
knew without fear of the consequences. When he had partially recovered 
from his fright, he said that he had been given letters and verbal instruc- 
tions from Lentulus to Catiline to the effect that Catiline should make use of 
the slaves and should hasten to Rome with an army as soon as possible. His 
plan was to attack the city from all sides, to set fire to the buildings, and to 
slaughter all the citizens. When he had finished, I brought in the Gallic 
legates, who reported that they had been given letters to their tribes by Len- 
tulus, Cethegus, and Statilius, which said that they were to send great num- 
bers of infantry and cavalry into Italy as soon as possible. 
At last I brought in the despatches. I showed them to Cethegus, and he 
acknowledged his own seal. I opened them and read. I found that the con- 
tents were indeed what the Gauls had said. Then Cethegus, accused of 
concealing weapons in his house, replied that he had always been an admirer 
of good steel. However, when the dispatches were read aloud his con- 
science smote him, and he remained silent. Statilius was then brought for- 
ward. He acknowledged his seal and handwriting, and, after the letters had 
been read, confessed his guilt, Then I showed the tablets to Lentulus, and 
asked him if the seals were his. He bowed his head in silence. After all 
his letters had been read, I gave him permission to speak, if he so desired, 
At first he vehemently denied all the accusations against him, but when all 
the evidence had been brought forth he suddenly leapt to his feet in anger 
and indignantly demanded of Volturcius and the Gauls what dealings they 
had with him. When they had answered briefly and consistently, and told 
how often and why they had come to him, then he, though maddened by 
crime, suddenly showed how great is the force of conscience. For, contrary 
to the opinion of every one, he confessed his guilt. Lastly, Gabinius was led 
in, and, though he answered arrogantly at first, he soon succumbed to the 
crushing weight of evidence, and he, too, confessed. 
And in my opinion, not only all the evidence, the letters, the seals, the 
handwriting, and the confessions of each man, seemed proof enough of their 
guilt, but their stealthy glances at each other, their shifty eyes, their guilty 
color, their sullen silence, seemed to me to prove their guilt and convict 
them absolutely. After all the evidence had been arranged and put in legal 
form, I asked the senate what they thought advisable to do. The leading sen- 
ators proposed very severe sentences against the criminals, and these meas- 
ures were unanimously adopted by the rest of the senators. They decreed a 
vote of thanks to me for my untiring efforts in the matter, and also to the 
two praetors who had conducted themselves in such a worthy manner. As 
for the conspirators, they were cast into prison to await sentence.

O, fellow citizens, as to the future safety of the state you need have no 
fears now. Since Catiline has been expelled from the city, the rest of the 
conspirators are helpless, for Catiline was the chief—aye, the very backbone 
of the conspiracy. He attended to everything himself, trusted no man to 
carry out his plans, and has proved himself an enemy to be feared. 
And now, fellow citizens, give thanks to Jupiter, the guardian of the 
city, and depart for your homes. i promise that in the future my efforts will 
be as great and untiring as they have been in the past. My reward for my 
services will be that you will always remember them, for I care ‘for no out- 
ward signs of fame. Rejoice, then, in the safety of the state, and thank the 
immortal gods that they have given me such wisdom and that they have 
kept the city from harm.

PLAYHOUSES AND PRIMITIVE HOMES 
  
The morning exercise was the result of experience gained through 
the study of providing shelter under varied conditions. After the 
children had described their own homes and others which they had 
seen in travels or in books, the environment of the tree man was made 
vivid by blackboard drawings and stories of forests and animals, The 
eave man’s surroundings of cliffs and rocks were presented in the same 
way. The background of the Indian and his wigwam was made clear 
  
    
FIRST GRADE HOUSES 
by means of stereopticon views of plains and mountains. The set- 
ting for the Eskimo and his home was made more realistic through 
descriptions of Arctic country and climate. 
After the children had studied some of the ways and means of 
making homes, they went one day to the woods, and while there they 
made a brush-house. When they returned, some of the children 
wished to make another brush house in the playground, others sug- 
gested digging caves, and still others wanted to build a brick house. 
Since a portion of the garden was given to them for their own use, 
they were able during their play period to carry out the plans that 
they had suggested. 
In making the brick house, the children used old bricks at. first, 
and then others were bought. They dug the sand from a neighboring 
67
-P-A-G-E-69

lot. In laying the bricks there was constant practice in making sur- - 
faces level and straight. Judgments had to be made as to the size 
of bricks and as to the quantity of cement used; also the amount of 
water necessary to make the cement. The problem of making the 
cement stick was worked out by experimenting, by observing brick- 
laying, and by questioning people who understood the work. The 
children found out that when all conditions were met, the bricklaying 
was well done, but if any condition was neglected, the results were 
poor. 
  
    
BRUSH HOUSE 
The problem of the cave men, as the young diggers called them- 
selves, was to get their cave deep enough to prevent the top from fall- 
ing in. An ingenious man, however, would frequently put boards over 
his excavation and cover them with dirt, or if he succeeded in making 
a tunnel only six inches in length from one cave to another he was 
wild with delight, and felt that he had been successful. One child 
who was very self-centered wished to work alone in his cave. His 
cave grew deeper, and the earth harder, and the work more difficult 
until one day he saw a pickax in the tool shed, and using it, found 
what a help it was to him. Then he went around and helped the other 
cave men and saw how much more two could do than one. Soon after 
this he came in from work and said, “I have taken a partner.” There 
were tithes when these cave men threw stones and dirt like their fore-

fathers, but gradually there grew a spirit of co-operation, and the 
right feeling came about without outside influence.

house were clearly presented by the children in the following exercise: 
Morning Exercise—Houses 
First Grade Teacher. For four years the children of the first grade 
have been making houses out in the woods and in the garden, and this morn- 
ing they are going to tell you something ‘about their work. The older chil- 
dren, who have been in the first grade and have done this work, will also tell 
you of their experiences. 
Note, The children chose the particular work they wished to talk about, and through 
their choice they naturally divided themselves into groups. When the exercise was given, 
the stereopticon pictures of the different types of shelter were thrown upon a screen, 
and as these pictures appeared, every group in turn went up and sat upon the floor of the platform. Each child then stood and told of his part in the work, and when all the group had finished, they again took their seats in the audience. 
Ruth (third grade), When the third grade were in the first grade, they 
went out into the woods on an excursion and came to a place where some 
vines were hanging from some trees in the shape of a nice little house, but on 
one side there were no vines, so we thought we would bring some leaves 
and make a nice house of it. We began doing it, and we pretended it was 
going to rain, and we must work faster. We did work a little faster, and 
after a while, when it was almost done, it did begin to rain, and we crowded 
into the house. 
Caroline (third grade). When we came home we thought we would 
make a brush house in the garden. We brought the brush from where the 
flat building is now standing. When that was all taken away, we brought 
more brush from an old tree that had fallen down in front of the School. 
When it was all done a hard rain came and knocked the roof off. 
Elizabeth G. (second grade). When we were in the first grade, we went 
to Glencoe and found a Brush house that the third grade had made when 
they were in the first grade, and we thought we would fill up the cracks. So 
we went out into the woods and found leaves and sticks and brought them 
back and put them into the cracks. We found vines and wove them between 
the cracks, and when it was finished we thought it rtice and cosy. 
Robert B. (second grade—pointing to a drawing in crayon on the 
board). 1 drew this picture. Here is Mr. Mortensen and a few children. 
The rest of the children have.gone to get their lunch, and Miss Walker and 
I are behind this tree. Mr. Mortensen built the fire, and the children are 
sitting around it eating and making believe they are Indians. The reason 
that we could not have a fire in the brush house was because we would 
burn it. : 
Robert H. (second grade), When we came back from Glencoe, we 
thought we would make a brush house in the garden. After Christmas we 
gathered up all the evergreen trees used for the Christmas decorations and 
stuck them in the ground. Then we took vines and wove them in and made 
a green house.
-P-A-G-E-71
70 Franots W. PaRKER SCHOOL 
Mary (first grade). This year the first grade made a brush house, and 
we wove into it cornstalks and sunflower stalks and morning glory vines, 
and sometimes used cord and string. But the goats would run through it 
and break it down. 
  
    
CAVES 
Charles (first grade). The first of this year we were talking about a 
man and the kind of a place he could live in without using tools to build it. 
We thought he might live in a tree or in a cave. We thought it would be 
too hard for us to make a tree-house, so we made a cave. After we had 
worked a long time, I put my shovel down, and it went right through into 
the girls’ cave, and we dug as hard as we could, and now we can go through. 
Ward (first grade—holding up a ruler and measuring off the inches). 
The boys’ cave is three feet and eighteen inches long, and the width of it is 
twenty-six inches. The widest place is one foot twenty-three inches, and the 
depth is sixteen inches. 
Philip (first grade). I wanted to start a little cave, so I started, and 
I struck something hard, and I thought it was a big rock, and then I thought 
it was ice, and I.called all the boys to help me get it out, and Jack threw 
in a shovel like a pickax, and we found that it was only frozen earth. 
. Margaret (first grade), When I was digging in the cave I saw a little 
toad in its hole, and just as I was trying to get him he hopped into the gar- 
den, and when he ran in I thought perhaps he would make a home there and 
stay until winter was over. . 
Roberta (first grade}. Does anybody know whether there are any real 
cave men now or not? 
Hermon (eighth grade). Yes, there are, in Africa. 
Margaret (fourth grade). When the fourth grade were in the first 
grade they made a wigwam. They made it out of brown cotton flannel, and 
sewed it together with brown thread. They pretended that the pieces of 
brown cotton flannel were skins and that the thread was sinew. Then 
we took three poles and fastened them together and set them up in the 
garden. We took the brown cotton flannel and put it around the poles and 
left an opening for a door and a little hole at the top, so that we could 
have a fire in the wigwam, and the smoke could go out at the top. 
Lisette (third grade). First, we made a clear space in the room to put
-P-A-G-E-72
YzEar Book 71 
the material on the floor, and when we cut it out we found that there were 
some little pieces missing down at the bottom, and so, we fitted in scraps. 
We went to the Field Museum, and we saw Indian wigwams there that ‘had 
pictures on them. The pictures told the dreams of the Indians. A bow and 
arrow meant that they had dreamed of hunting. When we went home we 
thought it would be nice if we could make some pictures on our wigwams, so 
we painted pictures with bright colors. It was near Christmas, and our 
teacher thought it would be nice to make little Indian wigwams for Christ- 
mas presents. They were penwipers and they had pictures on them. Mine 
had stars, and a moon and some arrows on it. The stars and the moon 
meant that I had.had a dream, and the arrows meant that I had been hunting. 
  WIGWAM 
René (fourth grade), One day when the fourth grade were in-the first 
grade, we had on our Indian suits and were out in the garden sitting around 
a fire, eating parched corn. We got the corn out of our garden and parched 
it in the domestic-science room. While we were eating the corn we told © 
stories. (Iw the exercise, a typical story was told.) 
Peggy (third grade). When the wigwam was finished, we wanted some 
mats to sit on. We found some long grass, but as we could not weave it 
very well, it took quite a while to make mats big enough to sit on. 
Allen (fifth grade). When I was in the first grade, we were studying 
houses, and some of us suggested making different kinds of houses. We 
talked about the kind of things our houses were made of, and one of us 
suggested making a brick house. First, we measured off the ground where | 
we wanted the house, and then we dug a little ditch around the sides. In this 
we laid the bricks which served as a foundation. When we got it done, we
-P-A-G-E-73

  FIRST BRICK HOUSE 
found that it was not on our land, so we had to tear it down. We used bricks 
that had been left from building the School. 
Caroline (third grade), When we were in the first grade we started to 
build the second brick house. We had the bricks from the old one to play 
with, and we pretended the bricks were blocks, but somebody knocked down 
the walls we made, and we told our teacher, and she said, “It is your own 
fault, because you did not build it strong enough.” And then we thought we 
  SECOND BRICK HOUSE 
would have to use mortar. We used three cups of cement and four of sand, 
and enough water to make it thick. 
Ruth (third grade), I measured the second brick house, and it is 7 feet
-P-A-G-E-74
Year Book 3 
8% inches long and 7 feet 5 inches wide. The window is 1 foot 8 inches 
wide. . 
Elizabeth G. (second grade), Last year I helped to lay the brick floor. 
We leveled the ground, and then we put on sand and laid the bricks. After 
the floor was laid, we put down a board and placed the level upon it, and 
if the bubble was in the middle of the level, the floor was even. There were 
many cracks between the bricks, and we filled these with sand, and then 
cemented the floor. 
Philip (first grade). Sometimes we laid one brick a day, sometimes two, 
sometimes three, and sometimes four. We worked hard on it. It takes a 
day and a half for a brick to dry. Sometimes when we have just laid a 
brick the children come around and knock it off, and sometimes the goats 
come through the window and walk on the wall and knock a brick off, too, 
and that makes more work. 
Ochm (first grade). One morning we went out and found that a part 
of the brick house was broken down, and Leone and Jack and I stayed after 
school and all of us worked at recesses on the house, but it took a long time 
to mend the broken place. Then it was broken down a second time, and ‘if 
it hadn’t been broken down so many places we would have been building the 
roof now. 
Elizabeth S. (second grade). I used to go out for about an hour after 
school and work on the brick house, and there were others in the group who 
worked, too. We had to soak the bricks in water over night; otherwise, in 
the morning, the cement would not stick. It took us a long time to find out 
what was the matter, and finally we thought we should try soaking: the 
bricks, because if we did not do this the water in the cement would go into 
the bricks and leave the cement dry and crumbly. 
Roberta (first grade), When we came to school in the fall we found 
that the brick house was too high to reach to the top of the wall, and we 
had to find high boxes to stand on, and it was not easy to climb up on 
them, and when we climbed upon them it was hard to carry the bricks and 
the sand and the cement and the water, and then we had to mix the cement 
up there. We found one box with sides about as thick as a cigar box, and we 
cut it into strips about four inches wide and about a foot long, and we 
used them for trowels. 
Warren (second grade). When we were in the first grade we thought 
we would build a snow house, and so we rolled big snow balls that high on 
me (holding his hand at his waist line), about two feet, and we put them one 
on top of the other until they were above my head—about 4 feet. But we 
could not make a roof, and so we got a big sheet and spread it over for a 
roof, and we went in and had a lot of fun. 
Robert S. (second grade). Last year, when we were in the first grade, 
we made a snow house, and we had trouble. First, it melted down; then 
we tried it again, and it melted again; then when it was colder, we tried 
again. We rolled snow balls until they were almost up to my shoulder, and 
began the walls of our house. Then we rolled others, but we found we 
could not have them so large, because we could not lift the big ones on top

SNOW HOUSES 
of the others. This year we thought it would be fun to have a party for the 
first grade, so we built 4 snow house over in the park, and all of us played 
Eskimo games. . 
Ward (first grade). This year we thought it would be lots of fun to 
build a snow house. We rolled big snow balls in our own yard and used up 
all the snow. Then we had to go into the garden, and we rolled one big 
snow ball about three feet high, and we could not lift it. So Miss Reed and 
I rolled it over to the house, and we called a lot of boys, and they helped to 
lift it up, and we had to pack it in so it would not roll off the wall. I wore 
the Eskimo suit and pretended I was Boaz, the Eskimo boy.

A NATURE EXCURSION 
  
We believe in studying nature out of doors. An eighth grade may 
go to dunes and lake ridges and ravines with the special purpose of 
studying physiography; a fourth or fifth grade may go to the same 
places to collect flowers, or to gather fruits for preserving; a first or 
second grade may seek there the geographical setting for stories of 
tree men or desert tribes. Often, all three of these purposes may com- 
bine, in varying degrees, in one excursion. Besides, there is always 
in the child’s mind the added desire to have a good time, and in the 
teacher’s mind the wish to found and foster in children a loving and 
intelligent interest in out-of-doors. Nature excursions have come to 
be one of the chief pleasures of our pupils. Yet these visits are far 
from being junketing trips. We go to answer, by original observa- 
tions, questions that have arisen in class-room study, and to collect 
material for further work at school. The following exercise was given 
by a fourth grade after two visits to the sand dunes. These trips 
were made as the accompaniment to many weeks’ study and simple 
experimentation in connection with soil formation. The children 
ground stones to make sand; pulverized rock and dissolved limestone 
to make clay; washed, sifted, and burned loam to find its constituents. 
The exercise may exemplify to a sympathetic reader the purposes of 
such trips, their relation to class-room work, amount of observa- 
tion made in the field, the pupils’ earnest attitude toward an excur- 
sion, the wholesome experiences and interests that it engenders, and 
the pleasure of the children in such a day in the open. 
A boy. Iam going to tell you how sand.is made. Some sand that we. 
found is made out of ground quartz. We looked at it through a micro- 
scope, and it looks like little pieces of quartz. Sand is of different colors, 
on account of the different colored stones that have been ground up by the 
waves. These are some stones that we found quite a way out in the lake, 
that had been broken up. As soon as they are ground up smaller, the waves 
will wash them up closer to the shore. Here are some we found closer to 
the shore. They were ground up by the waves and washed up further. This 
is some sand that we found still nearer to the edge of the water, 
Ralph (eighth grade).* The present outlet of Lake Michigan is through 
  
*This class was studying the topography of the Chicago region and was asked to 
contribute to our exercise an explanation of the presence of the sand in the dune district.

the Straits of Mackinac into Lake Huron, then through Lake Erie into 
Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River. When the glacier covered the 
lake, it had to have another outlet, and that was through the Sag into the 
Illinois River, and then into the Mississippi. The southern part of the lake 
was then much larger than it is now. The shore was twenty miles from the 
present shore, and as the glacier receded, the lake grew smaller at the 
southern end, As the water receded, it left different beaches. There are 
five or six of these different beaches between the old shore and the present 
shore, and it covered that whole country with sand. 
Drummond. In Lake Michigan there is a current from the north. The 
sand that is made by the grinding up of the stones comes down with the 
current, The current is not strong enough to be noticed, but when there 
is a storm the waves raise the sand, and the current carries it along until 
it comes down to the southern part of Lake Michigan, and it is washed 
against the shore. The undertow carries some of it back, but there is an- 
other wave coming along, and that will meet the undertow. The sand will 
drop and make a sort of small hill or sand-bar, and after a while that bar 
keeps getting bigger and bigger until it comes to the surface, and then if 
there is a wind towards the shore, the sand will blow towards the shore, 
and if there is a breeze from shore blowing towards the lake, the sand from 
the shore will blow to the sand-bar and make a dune there. 
After a while there will be water left on the land side of the 
dune, and the water will be stagnant there. After a while the 
water will evaporate, but the water from the lake will keep 
seeping through the sand under the dune into this marsh, 
because the bottom of the marsh is a little below the lake 
level. This apparatus shows how the water will go under the 
dune, because it always seeks its own level. Out in the yard, 
in the sand table, we made some sand dunes, and we made 
a lake around them and left a hollow in the sand, You can 
look at it in the play period. The water has soaked through the sand 
and come to a level with the water outside. : 
Hugh, When we were at the sand dunes, we saw a log, and it was about 
half covered up with sand, and if the wind keeps blowing, it will be covered 
by a little dune. And Delia, one of the girls that went with us, put her 
hat down, and when we went to get up, it was almost covered with sand. 
Leah (fifth grade). Out in the sand dunes, we saw a tree with its roots 
above the ground. (Showing sketch)., We think the sand must have covered 
it up this far on the trunk, and the roots came out of the trunk, and now 
that the sand has blown away, it has left the roots sticking out. Here are 
pictures showing that the sand has covered trees half-way up, and we think 
it must have been the same way with the tree we saw.. Here are dead trees 
standing up. (Showing sketch.) We think that once the sand covered all 
these trees, and while they were covered they died. Then the sand blew 
off, and you can see them dead. 
Ruth. This (showing specimen) was a branch growing on the trunk
-P-A-G-E-78
  ROOTS UNCOVERED BY MOVING SAND 
of a cottonwood tree, and the wind bent it down. The sand blew over it 
and covered the leaves and twigs. When they were covered, they changed 
to roots; instead of leaves and branches, it has started in to root. 
Hermon. A marsh won't stay in one’ 
place long; always dries up. The water 
evaporates through the plants. We have 
proved this by putting some water into this glass. 
We put some paper over it, and it cannot evapo- 
rate through the glass, and so if it evaporates, it 
must evaporate through the plant. There is now 
mist inside of the top glass. When the plants in 
the marsh die down, they make soil. We know 
this because if you look at the soil closely, you 
can see leaves. And if there is a dune or any- 
thing near by, the wind may blow sand into the EVAPORATION 
marsh, and so fill it up. 
Elizabeth. Margaret and Virginia in the fourth grade went out to Dune 
Park again, and they were climbing on a sand dune, and they saw some flint, 
and they thought that was a strange place to find flint, and they thought 
they would dig down to see if they could find anything else, and they found 
some pieces of Indian pottery and a perfect arrow-head, and we thought 
we would make pictures in our mind of how beautiful it was when the 
Indians were there, and we pictured a big bonfire and some Indians around 
chipping flint, and a tepee in the background with the women around getting 
supper or something like that. 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
78 Francis W. Parker Scnoor 
Teacher, We are going to try to 
tell you now what would make the sand 
dunes. a good place for the Indians to 
live. 
George. Margaret, and Virginia 
found a tree like this in the sand dunes, 
ngand they knew that the Indians had 
tried to get sap out of the tree. It was 
a pine tree. They used the sap in their 
canoes to fill up the cracks where the 
water gets in. It is called pitch. 
Dorothy. In the sand dunes, the fifth 
grade found bones of a deer. The deer 
lived there until the white: man came, 
PITCH PINE and, then they all went away. The 
Indians ate the deer meat, and then they made clothes out of the skins, and 
the ribs of the deer they put into their bows. For the strings of the bow 
they used the sinews of the hind legs. The Indians could find many other 
-useful things in the dunes—they could find’ fish, ducks, squirrels, frogs, 
quails, corn, snipe, cactus, grapes, sandpipers, sweet grass for their baskets, 
strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, wood for fires and geese. 
Katherine (showing specimens of plants). Here are some of the plants 
we found. This is the sand cherry, about as big around as your finger nail. 
People make preserves out of that and jelly and wine. And then there is 
the pitcher plant. It holds water in the swamp, and it is full of water when 
you find it. I will open one for you. It is full of insects. There are little 
hairs on the lip, pointing down, and when a bug comes in it can get down 
easy enough, but when it tries to get out it cannot get out, and it drowns, 
and the plant uses it for food. Then there is pokeberry that the Indians 
used to dye their skins with, and their bows and arrows, and people used 
to make ink from it. Here is some juniper, and some witch-hazel, and some 
wintergreen that people use for flavoring cakes and candies. 
Clara (showing lists of plants writtew on the board). Whenever we go 
on excursions, we have a list of the things we find, and here are some of 
them. If they grow in the dunes, we put them into the list of dune plants, 
_and if they live in the marshes we put them into the list of the marsh. 
Here are some plants. Here is the sea-rocket. It belongs to the cabbage 
family, because it tastes something like cabbage. This is the bug seed, 
because the seed looks something like a small bug. This is the chokecherry, 
and this is the bittersweet, ground pine, and this is the gold thread. The roots 
look like gold threads. And this is black alder. 
Arnold (fifth grade)*. In the sand dunes we found many different 
kinds of plants that have different ways of coming up in the spring. Bulbs 
is one way. In the spring, they don’t have to send out roots in the frozen 
ground, they send-up a new plant. Roots is another way. We found plants     
  
*This class had made some rather more mature observations of plants than the 
fourth grade had done, and we asked them to contribute to our exercise,

with very strong roots, and these roots have food in them, and the plant 
dies right down to the ground, and the roots send up a new plant. Under- 
ground stems is another way. With the underground stem, the plant sends 
up a sharp bud at the end of the stem. It goes along under ground and sends 
up little shoots. The shoots are very sharp, so they can get through the 
ground easily. Then there are some plants that grow by bud. Shrubs and 
trees have buds on them, and in the fall the leaves fall off and the buds 
are on, and in the spring, they don’t have to start all over. The leaves come

A STUDY OF BRIDGES 
  
The exercise on bridges is an outgrowth of the shopwork. The 
importance of bridges in our community-life, the various types of 
bridges in different localities (connecting vitally with geography 
work), the romance of their building, the deeds of bravery, daring, 
and skill of the bridge worker, and a study of the strains and stresses 
of the various “members” of a bridge, are topics of live interest to the 
fifth- and sixth-grade boy. This study in the shop results in an in- 
telligent appreciation of a bridge as a wonderful human achievement. 
In place of a meaningless mass of iron and steel, a bridge becomes 
almost a living thing. By means of experiments on test bridges, the 
effect of “teamwork” is emphasized—how different members of the 
bridge are working together to help support the load it is designed to 
carry, some “pushing” and some “pulling.” “Tension,” “compres- 
sion” and similar terms used by.the bridge engineer become a part of 
the boy’s vocabulary. This interest bears fruit in a desire to share 
his knowledge with the rest of the School in a morning exercise. Lan- 
tern slides of some of the noted bridges are thrown on the screen, and 
fhe mechanical principles explained. Experiments are performed, 
and the different strains and stresses in a bridge are pointed out. The 
following verbatim report is the result of the work of one class. 
Emily. The fifth grade have been studying about bridges and the dif- 
ferent things an engineer has to think about when drawing plans for’ a large 
bridge and the materials to build with. When a heavy weight is going over 
the bridge some pieces of the bridge are pushing, and some are pulling to 
help carry the load. 
The engineer has to.be a careful man, and he has to be a mathematician. 
Before he builds a bridge, he has to work it all out on paper. Then some- 
times, he makes small models like these (showing models) to experiment — 
with. When he is building the bridge, every single thing has to be right; 
he can not guess at a single thing; there are too many human lives in dan- 
ger. And when a beam is put in place, an inspector has to climb over it, 
and with a hammer he taps the heads of the rivets, and if they do not sound 
just right, he draws a ring around it, and a workman comes and cuts it 
out and puts in a new one, and makes it tight. There is a bridge in Quebec 
over the St. Lawrence river, and when they were building it, and had quite 
a good part of it done, and the workmen were on it, it collapsed. They 
found that one beam on the under side had been too weak, and it went down, 
80
-P-A-G-E-82
YEAR Boox 81 
and several of the workmen were killed. This is going to happen every 
time that an engineer is not accurate in his plans, 
Arnold. We performed several experi- 
ments to find out what the different parts of 
a bridge will do, and we found that some 
parts of the bridge push and some parts 
pull. This is a model of a very simple 
bridge. I suppose most of you have crossed 
a stream where there was a board across, 
and when you got to the middle, it would 
bend like this. We had a testing-box made, 
so that we could put the weight on top of 
this bridge. And then we put the weight 
down here, and it acts just the same as if 
we put it on top of the bridge. . 
Now I am putting trusses on this 
simple bridge. The bridge without the 
trusses held 18 Ib. 18 oz. We tested 
TEST BOX USED IN it until it broke. This bridge with 
EXPERIMENTS the trusses does not bend so much, 
because the weight pulling down on 
this beam, pulls on these wires. There are different strains on different parts 
of the bridge. There is the pulling or tension strain, the pushing or com- 
pression strain, and the transverse or bending strain. In this wire there is   
    
  BRIDGE WITHOUT TRUSS 
a tension strain, and in these trusses, there is a compression strain. This 
bridge broke at 125 pounds, while the other broke at 18 Ib. 13 oz.; so you
-P-A-G-E-83
82 Francis W. Parker Scuoon 
can sce how much the trusses do for a bridge. When we put about 50 Ib. 
on the bridge, we first noticed a change. The weight pushing on here and 
here bent this in like this, but it could not go down because the wires were 
holding it. This truss broke first because it had not been cut accurately, it 
was a little shorter than the other. Then this part had to break, because 
when the trusses were gone, it was nothing but a simple bridge and would 
only hold 18 1b. 13 02. 
Russell, We are going to show you a simple bridge, only bigger. You 
see how easily it bends without trusses. We will put the trusses on now. 
(Four boys put trusses ow a simple bridge, about seven feet long, and 
eight children got on it.). 
  
  BRIDGE SHOWING EFFECT OF TRUSS 
This summer when I was out in the country, they had simple bridges 
without trusses, and the men who had threshing machines, carried trusses 
with them, only they used chains instead of wires. The bridges were not 
strong enough to carry the threshing machines without the trusses. 
Lawrence. This bridge seems almost like that one. We studied a good 
deal about it, and we found it would have altogether different strains, When 
in this position, this has the tension strains, and this the compression strain. 
David, This kind of a beam is called an “I” beam, because it is just 
like the letter “I” in section. Thére are fibers in iron, just as there are 
fibers in wood, and the fibers at the top of the beam try to pull apart, and 
at the bottom, they push together, when it is loaded. This is a diagram of a 
bridge, and they put these “I” beams where there is the greatest strain. You

Question from audience. How long would it take to build a big bridge? 
Mr. Wahlstrom. On one of the larger bridges in New York they spent 
four years drawing the plans, and the engineer had a force of 25 to 50 men. 
After they begin work on such a bridge, it takes anywhere from two to ten 
years, according -to the size. Of course small bridges were built much more 
quickly.

CHEMISTRY OF WATER 
  
The morning exercises given by the chemistry and physics classes 
of the High School have dealt, as far as possible, with topics of general 
school interest.” Subjects have been chosen in which other grades are 
interested by reason of science work now going on or previously carried 
out, and upon which the high-school class feels that it has something 
definite and worth while to contribute. 
Much subject-matter of physics and chemistry should interest the 
high-school pupil directly, because in it he should find the broader 
principles underlying many topics which he previously studied in a 
more isolated fashion. Once the pupil has grasped such a principle, 
‘and has begun to apply it, he has gained a unifying idea which will 
give him a real and lasting interest in the science. He no longer needs 
prodding and pulling at the hands of his teacher, but the more pleas- 
ant and educative process of guiding and directing. Participation in 
the preparation and giving of a morning exercise has helped many 
pupils to a more thorough grasp of such a unifying idea. In their 
efforts to make plain to others, they have obtained a clearer conception 
for themselves. : / 
Water, as a subject of science-work, is studied from some point 
of view in each of the eight grades of the elementary school. Simple 
facts concerning the uses and properties of water are gained in the 
first and second grades, through the work in cooking and gardening. 
The subject is more fully taken up in the third grade, in connection 
with the study of the city’s history. The problem of Chicago’s water 
supply leads to a simple study of the physics of water levels and pres- 
sures. The purification of water by processes of settling, filtration, 
and distillation, is worked out, using colored salty water. Several 
grades are concerned with water as a medium for the preparation of 
erystals of various kinds. The sixth grade makes an extensive study 
of atmospheric moisture, rain, dew, clouds and related topics. The 
eighth grade in the study of minerals is interested in water as an agent 
for forming veins by methods of crystallization and precipitation. Also 
water is studied as a standard and means for the determination of the 
density of minerals by. the principle of Archimedes. Many other

points of contact might easily be enumerated. The group from the 
chemistry class working on the preparation of this exercise made a 
list of the points in which various grades might be interested. It was 
obvious that only a few of these could be utilized. After discussion, 
it was decided to make as the main point of the exercise the solvent 
power of water—that water as it comes from the ground contains dis- 
solved materials and is “hard.” 
With this idea in view a week previous to the giving of-the ex- 
ercise its title was announced, and all members of the school were 
invited to bring in specimens of water from favorite springs and 
wells, from as many different localities as possible. They were told 
that the chemistry class would test them and make a report on the in- 
teresting samples at the coming exercise. The response to this invita- 
tion was immediate, and a large number of samples were brought in 
from as many different sources. A report of the simple analysis, such 
as the class could make after six weeks’ study of chemistry, was given 
individually to each, person bringing in a sample, and furnished much 
interesting work for the entire class. The tests made in the exercise, 
for. the purposes of clearness and simplicity, were confined to two in 
number, one for chlorides and one for sulphates. These tests were 
made in front of a background of blackened cardboard. In other 
experiments. water levels were made visible to the audience by color- 
ing the water with a suitable dye, and using a white background. 
The plan of the exercise, which is given below, was displayed 
prominently during the exercise.

The verbatim report follows: 
Josephine. The chemistry class this morning is going to tell you some- 
thing about water. We will first show you of what water is composed, both 
by decomposing it into its two elements, and by making water from those 
two elements; and second, that water is a standard substance, and is the 
basis of calculations. Then we are going to make some tests on waters 
that were brought in by different members of the School, and show you 
that there are solids dissolved in almost all kinds of water as it comes 
- from the ground. 
The old Greeks thought there were four elements—earth, water, fire, and 
* air—but we now believe that there are over one hundred elements, and that Water

water is formed from two of the most important of these, oxygen and hy- 
drogen. These glass tubes* are filled with ordinary water, but colored so that 
the levels can be easily seen. In them the water is decomposed into oxygen 
and hydrogen. This is done by passing a current of electricity through the 
water. As soon as the circuit is complete, you can see little bubbles rising 
into the tubes, the water being forced down. You can see the levels chang- 
ing, since the water is colored. Now, the hydrogen comes up the tube on the 
left, while the other tube contains the oxygen. It is plain that there is twice 
as much hydrogen as oxygen in water. 
    
THE STAGE AS SET FOR THE EXERCISE    
ee 
This other apparatus} is to make water out of the two gases, oxygen 
and hydrogen, ‘Tt was first filled with mercury, then we put in enough hy- 
drogen to force the mercury down to this pasted mark, and then enough 
oxygen to force the-mercury down to the level at which it now stands. There 
are 10 cc. of oxygen and 20 cc. of hydrogen, so that all the space above the 
mercury is now filled with a mixture of these two gases. All that is neces- 
sary to make them unite to form water is to heat sufficiently. This is ac- 
complished by passing an electric spark through the mixture. There are two 
little wires on either side of the glass, and, when the circuit is completed, a 
spark will pass between the two wires and that will cause the hydrogen and 
oxygen to combine into water. (Mild explosion.) You see that the mercury 
now fills the tube and takes the place of the two gases which were mixed 
together. This shows that the volume of water is much less than that oc- 
_*The simple Hoffman apparatus for the electrolysis of water was used. The water, acidified with sulphuric acid, was colored with red ink. A background of white card. board was placed behind the apparatus. 
tA simple eudiometer tube with platinum points sealed in the glass, was used. Spark was furnished by an induction coil and battery. The amounts of hydrogen and oxygen gas introduced into the tube were indicated by white strips of paper pasted in position.

cupied by the mixed gases which are now united in a small amount of water 
at the top. 
Carl, An important use for water js as a standard for different pur- 
poses. Water is used as a standard for measuring temperature, heat, weight, 
and density. We will first consider it as a standard for temperature. If we 
place an ordinary thermometer in melting ice, the mercury will rise to 32°, 
and if we put it in boiling water it will rise to 212°; therefore, we find that’ 
water freezes at 32° and boils at 212°. These facts are used in making ther- 
mometers. The unmarked thermometer is placed in melting ice, and the 
point marked to which the mercury falls. Then it is placed in boiling water, 
and an additional mark made at this point. The space between the two 
marks is then divided into 180 equal patts in the case of the Fahrenheit 
thermometer or 100 divisions in case of the Centigrade thermometer. 
Now we will consider water as a standard of density. To find the den- 
sity of a substance, we have only to find the weight of equal volumes of 
the substance and water, and obtain the ratio of these two weights. For 
example, take 10 cc. of water and 10 cc, of mercury, weigh them and we find 
that the mercury is 13.6 times as heavy as the water. Therefore we say 
that.the density of mercury is 13.6. Water is also a standard of weight. 
The metric system of weights and measures is based on the fact that the 
weight of 1 cc. of water is called 1 gram. To prove this experimentally I 
have here 1,000 cc. of water measured out in this beaker. This other beaker 
on the balance pan is empty and counterpoised with shot, so that its weight 
is eliminated. I put a 1,000-gram weight on the other pan and pour the 
water into the empty beaker. You sce* that the water exactly balances the 
1,000-gram weight. This proves the fact that 1 cc. of water weighs 1 gram. 
Katherine. It takes more heat to raise the temperature of water a cer- 
tain number of degrees than any other substance. Hence water is used to 
measure of power of other substances to hold heat. I am going to prove 
that water, weight for weight, holds more heat than ordinary sand. In this 
steam jacket* are 115 grams of water, and in this 115 grams of sand. These 
two beakers each contain 200 grams of water at the same temperature. I 
pour the hot water into one beaker and the hot sand into the other and 
stir. I shall expect this beaker, into which the hot water has been poured, 
to show a higher temperature than the one into which I poured the hot 
sand. This is true, for this beaker now has a temperature of 43° C., while 
the other registers only 33° C. This shows that water has greater heating 
capacity than sand. This fact has an important bearing on climate, for, 
since water holds heat longer than ordinary sand or soil, there is a marked 
retarding influence of large bodies of water on the climate of any country 
near them. This is true of Chicago and the country around Lake Michigan. 
The fall is later and the spring later than is the case farther inland. 
Ruth. The most important quality of water is its power to dissolve sub- 
stances. Some dissolve more easily in hot water, and some more easily in 
*The boilers were of the type generally used in physics. The sand and water were weighed out in cups fitting into the tops of the boilers. The temperatures of both vessels 
of water were asstimed to be the same—that of the room.

cold. Most substances are more soluble in the hot water. Here in this 
beaker (holding up the beaker) is some lime water. It is a solution of lime 
and water. -I will heat it to boiling, which will show you that lime is less 
soluble in the hot water. While it is heating, I will show you a second sub- 
stance which is more easily soluble in hot than cold water. This beaker 
contains potassium dichromate dissolved in hot water. I will place it in 
this vessel of cold water in order to cool it quickly. (While waiting for 
tt to cool.) Some other substances dissolve equally well in hot or cold 
water. This is true of salt.or sugar. In some parts of the country the 
water contains a great deal of lime. This water is purified by boiling it, 
which throws the lime out of solution, as is the case in this hot lime water, 
as you can now see (holding up beaker of heated lime water showing pre- 
cipitated lime). In the other beaker a mass of solid potassium dichromate 
“has been thrown out of solution as it cooled, which shows that it is not so 
soluble in cold water. So you see these substances behave in opposite ways 
from one another. 
Milo. Ordinary water coming from the ground is “hard,” that is, sub- 
stances are dissolved in it. These substances may dissolve in large quanti- 
ties.. Very hard water is not very good for washing, as the dissolved ma- 
terials do not allow the soap to act. Compounds of lime are those more 
commonly found in ground water. These substances are in the soil and 
enter solution when the water passes through the strata containing them. 
The two most common classes of compounds in solution in water are chlorides 
and sulphates. I will show you how to test for them. 
I have here some water in which has been dissolved a small amount 
of potassium sulphate. If I add barium chloride to this, it turns milky, 
showing the presetice of the sulphate. This second vessel contains a dilute 
‘solution of potassium chloride; I will add silver nitrate to it. You see it 
also turns white and cloudy, showing the presence of the chloride. Or- 
dinary “Hydox” (distilled) water contains neither of these substances. To 
one portion of this pure water I will now add barium chloride. You see 
it remains perfectly clear. I will add silver nitrate to another portion, 
Again there is no precipitation, I will now use these two tests on samples 
of water brought in by various members of the School to see if they con- 
tain sulphates or chlorides. 
This water is from Hot Springs, Arkansas. I will test it for chlorides, 
using silver nitrate. You see it contains an abundance of chlorides. I will 
also test another portion of it for sulphates. There are also some sulphates 
in it. . 
This water is from Harbert, Michigan, brought in by Miss Leubrie. 
I will test it for chlorides. You see it turns milky. I will test it for sul- 
phates. There are evidently almost no sulphates in that water. 
This is artesian water from the Lessing Apartments. I will test it for 
chlorides. You see it turns somewhat milky, though it does not contain a 
large amount of chlorides. But the other test shows that it contains con- 
siderable sulphate, as you see. .
-P-A-G-E-90
Yar Book 89 
This is also artesian water, but from Lake Geneva. I will test it for 
chlorides. You see it turns milky. There are some sulphates also, but not 
as much as in the other case. 
This is ordinary Lake Michigan water. I will test it for chlorides. It gives 
a faint test. I will test it for sulphates. There is no evidence of sulphates. 
This water is from a south-side spring. I will test it for sulphates. 
There are no sulphates in it. I will apply the chloride test. You see it con- 
tains a large amount of chlorides. 
Although water may contain both sulphates and chlorides, it is not neces- 
sarily impure in the sense that it is unfit-to use. 
Miss Cooke. Is it harmful in either case? 
Milo. No, not unless the amount is excessive. 
Mr. Osborne. This is the conclusion of the exercise. Some points per- 
haps may not have been made as clear as you would like, but if you will 
ask questions, we will try to make them plain. 
Miss Hall. Can you explain the effect of Lake Michigan on climate in 
a simpler way? 
Katherine. Lake Michigan takes a longer time to get hot, and a longer 
time to cool off than the country about it. In the spring it takes it such a 
long time to warm up that our springs are very late and cold. In the fall, 
it is so slow in cooling off that Chicago falls are consequently warmer 
and later than is the case farther inland. 
Question from audience. Why is it that the color of the last jar has 
turned from white to brown? 
Mr. Osborne. That is the water from the south-side spring. It contains 
some sulphur which is responsible for the change in color.

A SERIES OF EXERCISES ON ILLUMINATION 
  
The following reports show how a topic of broad interest, de- 
yeloped in its various aspects throughout the School, furnishes ma- 
terial for morning exercises, and how the value of these exercises is 
greatly enhanced by the fact that practically the whole School has had 
experience with some phase of the subject. The knowledge of the 
experiences of the other grades stimulates each group, giving an ex- 
-ercise to thoroughness in the presentation of their contribution to the 
School. 
The subject of fires and illumination is begun in the first grade. 
The children in their study of Indian life try to make fire in many 
ways, and they rediscover some of the methods used by primitive peo- 
ple. The accompanying group of pictures shows processes which the 
children explained with models at a morning exercise given after a 
series of such class-room experiments.

The children also described the candles and candlesticks which 
they had made for Christmas gifts. The candles were molded of

The third grade have given exercises about illumination which 
grew out of their study of early Chicago. The children study the 
lives of the settlers as intimately as possible, and prominent in this 
study are problems of cooking, heating and lighting. co

CANDLES AND CANDLESTICKS MADE BY CHILDREN 
With a background furnished by a review of their first grade 
work,* and the children’s imagination, the class traces the develop- 
ment of methods of illumination to the modern kerosene lamp, gas, 
and electricity, and the use of the two latter for city lighting. Dif- 
ferent phases of the work are emphasized in successive years, and the 
morning exercises which are outgrowths of the work show this very 
clearly. One year, considerable time had been spent on the earliest 
methods of lighting by bonfires and the later stages of candle-making. 
At the morning exercise, the pupils explained the various kinds of 
wood they had tried for bonfires, and their conclusions as to which 
were the most desirable as light- 
givers. They also showed candles 
made of five different materials, 
and told the results of tests which 
they had made to find out which 
gave the most light, which burned 
steadiest, which lasted longest, 
and which smoked least. 
Another year, while working 
with candles, the third grade 
showed the numerous kinds of 
molds with which they had ex- 
perimented, such as bottles, eyl- 
inders of tin or cardboard, and 
TESTING CANDLES MADE OF DIF. plaster-of-Paris molds. 
The study of the problem of 
lighting the streets and buildings of the city led to the making of 
coal gas in clay pipes and burning it, and afterwards to the filling of 
  *In this review the Parker School Leaflets about the history of lighting were used.

a large reservoir with gas, by the apparatus shown in this picture. 
  DRAWING MADE BY A PUPIL OF THE GRADE 
To illustrate the process of gas storage after its manufacture, and 
the piping of gas to the buildings of the city, the filled reservoir was 
brought to the morning exercise, and its contents were burned at the - 
end of a long tube, to which a gas-burner had been attached. 
During those years, when members of the third grade brought 
numerous old-fashioned lamps to the School for study, much attention 
was given to them. The morning exercise which follows was given 
in such a year. Most of the pictures in the following pages show 
lamps loaned for examination. The others are copies of illustrations 
found in old magazines and elsewhere. 
For this exercise the room was darkened, and on the stage were 
all the lamps the grade had. All that could be so used were lighted. 
Slides were thrown on the screen, and the children described them as 
shown in the following stenographic report of the exercise: 
Lamps 
Teacher. The third grade is going to tell you this morning something 
of the history of lighting—something of the history of lamps. We are not 
going to tell you the complete history, starting at the earliest stages, and 
going on up, but by using such examples as we have, we will try to iflus- 
trate some of the facts that we know about lamps. The lamps that we have 
attempted to light show some of the defects of early methods, namely, that 
they were hard to start, and that after they were started, they needed a 
good deal of attention. 
Joseph. Many years ago they did not have enough lamp-posts to light

the streets sufficiently, so people 
wishing to go out at night, hired 
these torch-bearers to escort them 
to the place they wanted to go and 
then call for them again. These 
torches they did not like very 
much, because they gave so much 
smoke. The lamp-posts they had 
were like these. It was the night- 
watchman’s duty to look after the 
lamp-posts. He had a pail filled 
with pitch-pine knots. If the lamp 
was empty, he put some in. Some 
of the torches were made so that 
the pot for the knots would stand 
upright, when the torch was low- 
ered, 
Marcia. These lamps are Es- 
kimo lamps. This one is made of 
soapstone hollowed out, and is 
called a sledge-lamp. The other 
two lamps are made of hard-baked clay. The large one had a nick in one 
side in which the wick may lie. I can’t tell whether or not the other one 
has a nick for the wick, but this looks as if it were one. These two lamps

  ESKIMO LAMPS 
are made of clay. They are very old-fashioned lamps. The edges of this 
one are turned up to make a place in which the wick may lie, and this one 
is turned up a very little on the edge for the wick. 
These are Egyptian lamps. They are all about the same. They poured 
the oil in here, and the wick lies there. These two have handles. 
Edmund.* This woman is making tallow candles, and this pot is full 
of melted tallow. She takes a stick and ties strings onto it about ten inches 
long, six of them, and about four inches apart, and then she dips them down 
several times until there is enough tallow on the strings to make good can- 
dles. 
These are some molds that are used in making candles. A string tied 
to the middle of a nail is dropped into the mold and through a hole in the

Carter. These lamps are old fashioned. This one has two arms stick- 
ing up there, and the wicks go through them into the oil place here. They 
take the cover off and put the oil in the top. The oil that drips from the

wick drops down into this trough and then goes back into here, This lamp 
has two arms or posts that are fastened ona ring. There is a little round 
button here, and one like it on the other side, that fastens onto the oil tank 
so that it can swing either way, but it won't tip over. This is a little cup

with two tubes sticking up through it, and the wicks go down into the oil- 
tank. You can unscrew it. It soaks up twice as much oil and gives three 
times as much light as one wick would. On this you don’t unscrew the cap, 
ut put the oil in through a little place there. 
    RUSSIAN SABBATH-LAMP You can lower and raise the 
wicks of this one by this lit- 
tle tube. 
In this lamp they had a 
single wick, and when they 
wanted to put the light out, 
they put this cap over it and 
put it out. 
Baxter. This lamp is a 
Russian Sabbath-lamp. They 
put the oil in the tube here, 
and it goes out into these six 
troughs. If the oil drops, it 
goes along a little groove 
into this little pan. 
This lamp (exhibiting 
lamp) was used in New Eng- 
land about three hundred 
years ago. You can open this
-P-A-G-E-98
Year Book 97 
and put the oil in, and then it will snap back. . There is a little place in it to 
hold the wick. This lamp can be stuck into’a crack of a log cabin, or hung 
up that way. In this lamp you open this place here and put the oil in, and 
the wick goes up through this small hole. This little wick is in the oil all 
the time, so that if you want to light something else, you can take that out 
and light it and put it back. 
Question (from the audience). When was that lamp used? 
Teacher. That appears to be a copy rather than an original. We think 
it is a copy of an old Roman lamp, but we are not sure. 
Olga. This is a bull’s-eye lamp. It has two tubes where the wicks go 
up. The magnifying glasses are to make the light brighter, and it gives

more light. on account of the magnifying glasses. These tops on the mag- 
nifying glasses are to make the light shine on your paper or whatever you 
are doing. This top unscrews, and you put the oil in here. These are 
cigar lighters but they are made in the shape of old-fashioned lamps. 
Question (from the audience). Who used the bull’s-eye lamp? 
Teacher. It was used in the United States Senate by Carter’s great 
uncle. . 
George. This is a sailor’s lamp, and has its tank swung from arms 
on two posts, so that it cannot tip over. There is one nice thing about 
it, you can turn up the wick by this screw. A good many of the old- 
fashioned lamps did not have screws to turn up the wick. This tall lamp 
is a reading-lamp. It also has a screw to turn up the wick. The sailor’s 
lamp has a flat wick which gives more light than the round one. | 
Thornton. This is a reading-lamp, and it has little caps, and when they 
stop reading, they put these little caps over the lights and put them out. 
It is made of pewter. Pewter is made of tin and lead melted together. This 
thing is called a snuffer and is used to put the light out. These were called

camphine-lamps because 
they burned camphine. 
This lamp is to use in a 
barn. When a man 
wanted to go out and 
harness his horse at 
night, he would take this 
with him and jab it into 
the wall, or when they 
had guests in the house, 
they put it on the wall 
so as to have light on 
the porch. 
Question (from the 
audience). What is cam- 
phine? 
Teacher. Camphine 
is a product of turpen- 
tine. It is a highly ex- 
READING LAMP plosive material; and I 
. presume the arrangement 
of the tubes, far apart instead of close together as in other lamps, has some- 
thing to do’ with the character of the oil being burned in it, 
Question (from the audience). How long ago was it that the bull’s 
eye lamps were used in the United States Senate? 
Teacher, In 1925, 
Mr. Zalinko* In Russia they had an old style of lighting country-houses. 
It consisted of a little piece of wood. This was put in some oil, and they 
lighted this little piece of wood, and when it was burned out, they changed 
it and took a new one. There was always a little girl or boy sitting close 
_ to this old style of lamp and changing these little bits of wood. During 
the long winter evenings the little boys and girls of the family used to 
help with these lamps, changing them all the time. 
Teacher. It is interesting to know how the man who wrote Webster’s 
dictionary worked. He had two lamps something like this, except that there 
was no arrangement for raising the wicks. At the beginning of the evening, 
he had these lamps filled, and when they had both burned out, he considered 
that he had finished an evening’s work. 
Volunteer contribution (from audience). It is said that in South America 
there are very large fireflies, which the natives catch and place in cages 
made of bamboo. These cages are used as lanterns. 
Question (from the audience), Why is a flat wick considered better than 
a round wick? — 
Teacher. There is more chance for the air to reach the surface of the 
wick, and therefore it gives a better light. 
    
  
*Mr. Zalinko, of Moscow, was a guest of the School on the day this exercise was 
given, and made this contribution.

Co-operation between the grades in this study has been possi- 
ble through the medium of the 
the third grade, while studying 
modern methods of illumination, 
asked the high-school class in 
physics to give an exercise on 
electricity, a subject too difficult 
for experimentation in the third 
grade. 
The process of manufactur- 
ing illuminating gas is a part of 
the chemistry course, and the 
high-school class studying this 
subject presented exercises to 
show laboratory and factory meth- 
ods of manufacture, and to ex- 
plain the chemical processes in- 
volved. That an exercise of this 
sort made its point, in: one in- 
stance at least, is attested by the 
accompanying cartoon drawn for 
the school magazine by one of the 
seventh-grade boys. 
This brief outline will serve 
to show how the work on one topic 
furnishes much material for ex- 
ercises. It also shows that the 
grade presenting any one aspect 
of a subject has a background of 
experience gained through other 
morning exercises on the general 
subject, and that nearly every one 
in the audience likewise has a 
fund of first-hand knowledge morning exercise. For example,

THREE EXERCISES ON THE HISTORY OF POTTERY 
  
The recognition of manual training and applied art as subjects 
rich in cultural material, because they mirror the whole history of 
human progress, opens a field which we feel is full of undeveloped 
possibilities for our school. Of course, it is customary to correlate the 
handwork as fully as possible with history, science, graphic art, or 
literature. Sometimes the connection is close and obvious; sometimes 
it is so slight that there is practically none. ‘The latter situation is 
the opportunity for the handwork teachers to do some background 
building on their own account—for it is in the background of each 
piece of handwork that its cultural value lies. By background I mean 
the relation of the object to the world, present and past, along the 
lines of natural science, history, geography or art. 
But it takes time to do these things, and time is precious. So 
sometimes we try, by dramatic representation, to bring a distant place 
or period to the children at morning-exercise time. Typical phases 
of work, phases touching closely the other school work, are best for 
these representations. If carefully planned to be accurate in detail, 
yet simple enough to be easily done and casily understood, they can 
impart a great deal of information, and, by beauty of stage picture, 
can serve as an inspiration to the School to do better handwork than 
ever before. 
As an example of such representation, there follows an account 
of three morning exercises, given on successive days, illustrating three 
stages in the history of the potter’s art. Contrary to our usual custom, 
according to which the morning exercise is an outgrowth of class- 
work, these scenes were arranged chiefly by the teachers, who were 
able to produce a stage picture more correct in detail and more artis- 
tic in engemble than the children could have managed. In the Indian 
scene, however, the sixth-grade children, who were studying the Pueblo 
Indians in their history class, were able to help a good deal in plan- 
ning the stage business and setting. The tenth-grade ancient history 
class made the proscenium decoration and the dado for the Egyptian 
scene, and the boy who took the part of the potter helped to build and 
learned to use the primitive wheel. (He had worked on the kick-wheel 
before.) - Japan being a country of which we have, as yet, made very 
little study in our school, the preparation of that scene was wholly 
a faculty matter. 
There was one rehearsal for each scene, so that the effect of the 
100
-P-A-G-E-102
Yuar Boox mi 
stage picture could be studied, and so that each child could know 
just what was expected of him, but as there were no spoken lines, slight 
variations of procedure were of no importance, and each could go 
quite independently about his business. As there was no change of 
scene during the exercise, no curtain was necessary. 
The chief materials for scenery were gray building-paper ($1.00 
per roll of about 60 yards) and colored chalks. The latter were used 
directly upon the brown-painted wall for the Egyptian dado, and after- 
wards washed off with sponge and water. In the Indian scene, beyond 
producing adobe-colored walls, our chief problem was to disguise the 
doorway. The children took the door measures, compared them ‘with 
the pictures of Pueblo doorways* and concluded that a high sill and 
a transom would make our opening what it should be. 
The Japanese scene (of which the reproduction is wholly inade- 
quate) was the most complicated, as we had to suggest a garden, and 
could spare only three feet of stage depth for it. At that- distance 
from the back wall, we set shoji (wall-screens) improvised out of old 
scenery frames, with cardboard panels at top and bottom, and real 
shoji paper between. Behind these was a backdrop (building paper 
and chalk again) made for us by an artistic alumnus, and at the base 
of it were potted ferns, a pink azalia, and a purple iris of Japanese 
paper. The charm of the scene lay in the fact that we had electric 
lights behind the shoji, while the gymnasium was slightly darkened, 
so that one seemed to be looking out into the sunlight. A pine branch 
behind one shoji panel threw its shadow upon the paper with a truly 
Japanese effect, but the flashlight was so much stronger than our 
stage sunlight, that the charming shadow is wholly absent from the 
photograph, and the perspective of the backdrop is lost. 
In making our costumes, we chose the materials, as well as the 
colors, that were the nearest we could buy to the real things. Of course, 
some of the Japanese garments were genuine, and for our apprentices 
we took pains to select colors and patterns suitable for men, for it is 
easy to borrow Japanese kimonos for women, but hard to find Japanese 
garments for men in this part of the world. The properties, as far as 
possible, were authentic. The extreme simplicity of setting, which 
was intended to be suggestive, rather than photographic, made the 
impression clear, even in the minds of the youngest children, while at 
the same time it was a good background for the working figures. 
  
*The most_useful reference we found was Mindeleff’s article on “Pueblo Archi-

History of Pottery—Indian Scene 
  
    
INDIANS MAKING POTTERY 
Leader. Pottery is one of the oldest arts known to mankind. Almost 
all peoples have made some sort of pottery, and from the examples we 
find of the work done in this line, we have learned a great deal of what we 
know about the early races which have lived in the world. The art began 
in a very simple way, and gradually became better and better. It some- 
times happened that people in one part of the world were just at the be- 
ginning period of pottery making, while other people in another part of the 
world had advanced much further in the art. We are going to show 
you three scenes representing three stages in the history of pottery making. 
We shall begin this morning with our own southwestern Indians, tomorrow 
we shall represent the early potter’s wheel, and Wednesday we shall give a 
scene representing the decoration of pottery. 
Matilda (sixth grade), The Hopi Indians live on the table lands of 
Arizona and New Mexico. The stage today represents a room in one of 
the Indian houses. The houses of these Indians are built like steps, and 
each step is called a terrace. The gymnasium floor is supposted to represent 
the ground, and the stage represents the first terrace. This really does not 
represent it quite right, because it is a good deal higher from the ground to 
the first terrace, but because the stage is so low we could not represent it 
exactly right. This ladder leads from the ground to the first terrace, and this 
door leads to a room opening on the terrace. 
(Enter Indian woman and child from doorway at back of gymnasium. 
Passing down aisle, they ascend stage by ladder. Woman has load of clay 
wrapped in cloth hanging from head. Child carries water bottle hung on 
thong which passes about head.) 
This woman and child have been down on the plain getting clay. They 
get the clay from the banks of the river. The children wear brown blankets, 
but the women wear blankets dyed dark blue.
-P-A-G-E-104
Year Boox 103 
(Woman opens cloth, gets stone pounder, and goes to work Child squats 
by her, watching. While first woman pounds, enter girl from door L, takes 
prepared clay and begins to build bowl.) 
This shows the woman pounding the clay. She must pound it up, be- 
cause it is very hard sometimes, and she pounds it up so that she can work 
with it. Then she puts the clay that she has pounded into a jar, and she puts 
water over it, so that the clay will settle and separate from stones or other 
impuritiés. She goes into another room now. 
This is a young Indian woman. You will notice her hair. The young 
women when they are of age to be married, wear their hair in whorls over 
their ears, but the married women and the older women wear their hair 
hanging and tied in two bunches, as the first one wore hers. 
(Enter third woman. Gets partly-finished bowl from back of stage and 
goes to work.) 
The young woman is making a bowl out of clay. This other woman 
who has just come in takes a bowl that was not quite finished, and scrapes 
it. She uses a piece of gourd to scrape with. The young woman, having 
built up her bowl as far as she can while the clay is very soft, puts it aside 
to harden a little, and gets another bowl, that she has started another day, 
and works on it. She molds the clay in a basket, because that helps her 
to shape it well. . 
(Enter fourth woman.) 
This woman takes a slab and mixes the colors that she is going to paint 
the bowls with. She gets these colors from the earth. She digs up red 
and yellow and black earth, and mixes each with water on a grinding slab. 
Then she uses them on the bowl. When it is finished and dried, it is ready 
to be fired. When they have a number of pots all finished and waiting to 
be fired, they pile the pieces together and put the fuel over them. They used 
to use lignite for fuel, but now they don’t because they can’t get it. They 
made much better pottery when they used lignite for fuel. As soon as this 
(the third) woman has scraped the bowl a little, she takes a polishing stone 
and polishes it. 
Fourth-grade child. Where do they get the red ground from? 
Leader, That is to be found in their country. You have heard of the 
“painted desert” of Arizona and New Mexico. A good deal of the earth 
there is colored with iron, and that is where they get the red and yellow. 
Third-grade child. Do the children make pottery? 
“ Leader, The girls learn to make pottery, but they do not make many 
pieces until they are nearly grown. 
Question (from audience), What kind of brushes do they have? 
Leader, They sometimes take hairs from their own heads, or from 
,animals’ tails, but more often use vegetable fibre, which they bind to a little 
stick, 
Second-grade boy. What do the boys do? 
Leader. One of the things that the men do is to make clothes, not only 
for themselves, but for the women. They do all the weaving. They also 
work on small farms, which they cultivate down below the mesa. They 
raise sheep, too, and the men and boys take care of them. «
-P-A-G-E-105
104 _ Fraycis W. Parker ScHoon 
High-school boy. What kind of fuel do they have now? 
Leader. They have no coal in their part of the country, and very little 
wood, so now that the lignite (which is coal in the process of making) 
is exhausted; they have to use the fuel they have at hand. So they go into 
the sheep corrals, where the earth is packed down hard, and dig up pieces 
of the down-trodden dung to burn. They do not use wood for firing pottery 
because it does not last long enough. The fire has to smoulder thirty-six 
hours. They pile the fuel right upon the pottery, making a mound of it. 
Sometimes the pots that are touched by the fuel are scorched on one side, 
but that does no harm—only adds variety to their color. 
Fourth-grade child. What kind of houses do they live in? 
Leader. They live in very large houses, called pueblos, which are prac- 
tically villages. All the people live together in one house. Sometimes each 
family has a room, and sometimes, if they are well to do, several rooms. 
You can see some pictures of pueblos in the hall. 
High-school girl. Do they plan their designs carefully? 
Leader. As far as the design goes, yes, they do plan carefully and 
‘beautifully, but they do not always plan the spacing very carefully. You can 
tell that because the patterns do not always come out even. 
Seventh-grade child. Do they ever live anywhere except on the mesa? 
Leader. Some of them now build houses down near their farms, in order 
to save the long walk up to the mesa. Matilda will tell you why they 
build their homes on. the mesa. 
Matilda. The reason they live on the mesa is because the mesa is very 
high and steep, and in early days there were savage Indians around them. 
They lived on the mesa to keep away from their enemies. 
Fifth-grade child. What are their houses built of? 
Leader. They build their houses of the Stone of the mesa. This is 
another curious thing about the Hopi Indians—the men go out and gather 
the stones, but the women build the houses; the women are the architects. 
First-grade child. I should think that the women did the hardest work. 
Egyptian Scene 
Leader. Yesterday morning we showed you something of the potter’s 
work before he had learned to use a wheel. The Indians are still making 
pottery as you saw the Indian women making it yesterday, but in Egypt, 
nearly four thousand years before the birth of Christ, people had learned to 
use the wheel in making pottery, and this morning we are going to show 
you how the Egyptians worked. ’ 
(Enter Egyptian man, water jar on shoulder. Goes to mass of clay on 
plank at back of stage, sprinkles some water upon it, and begins to work it 
with his feet.) 
The first thing that the Egyptian potter has to do is to prepare the 
clay. He does that by tramping on it with his feet. He can do it quicker
-P-A-G-E-106
YEAR Boox . 105 
  
  
  EGYPTIAN POTTERY-MAKER 
in that way than by working it in his hands, First he washes it, then kneads 
it, and when it is worked enough, he takes it to the wheel. The early 
Egyptian potter worked his wheel by hand; you will see how he used it. 
(Potter crouches at wheel, throws lump of clay upon middle of it, sets 
wheel whirling with his hand, and begins to shape bowl.) 
Out on the screen in the hall there is a drawing, from an Egyptian wall 
painting, of a hand-wheel, and another of a late Egyptian wheel worked by 
foot power, very much as ours down stairs is worked. Unfortunately we 
did not get our Egyptian wheel to work very well by hand. It is not heavy 
enough to revolve well, so we are going to show you what modern invention 
has done. The improvement made next after inventing the kick-wheel was 
to put a crank on the wheel and have it turned by a boy, and since that was 
invented, we have learned to apply mechanical power. (A belt run by elec- 
tricity is attached to the wheel.) It is absurd to try to show you an Egyptian 
potter’s wheel run by electricity, but it has its advantages; we wanted to 
have a power-wheel for the modeling room, and we have found out that we 
can have one. While we are waiting for the wheel to be rightly adjusted, 
T will read you part of-a poem by Longfellow (I have read you portions of 
it before) about a potter at work at his wheel. From the earliest times, 
poets have been interested in watching the potter working at his wheel. In 
the Bible, you will remember, there are a great many references to the 
subject. In Jeremiah, the prophet is told to go to the house of the potter, 
and there the word of the Lord will come to him. He goes, and-as he. 
watches the potter at work, he realizes that as clay is in the hands of the
-P-A-G-E-107
106 Franots W. Parker ScHooL 
potter, so is mankind in the hands of. the Lord, Longfellow was inspired 
by watching the potter work to write his poem “Keramoa,” which I will 
quote: 
“Turn, turn, my wheel! Turn ’round and ’round 
Without a pause, without a sound. 
So spins the flying world away! 
This clay, well mixed with marl and sand, 
Follows the motion of my hand; 
For some must follow and some command, 
Though all are made of clay.” 
Thus sang the potter at his task, 
Beneath the blossoming hawthorne tree; 
And while he plied his magic art— 
For it was magical to me— 
I stood in silence and apart, 
And wondered more and more to see 
That shapeless, lifeless mass of clay, 
Rise up to meet the master’s hand, 
And now contract, and now expand, 
And even his slightest touch obey. 
In the following verses, the poet tells the things that he saw in his mind - 
as the potter worked at his wheel. Then comes another verse of the 
potter’s song: 
“Turn, turn, my wheel! This earthen jar 
A touch can make, a touch can mar; 
And shall it to the potter say, | 
‘What makest thou, thou hast no hand,’ 
As men who think to understand 
A world by their creator planned, 
Who wiser is than they.” 
Now we can watch the work. 
First, the potter has to get his clay well centered—that is, to get the 
lump of clay running true on his wheel. 
A teacher. How fast would a potter have to move the wheel with his 
hand—the old Egyptian wheel? 
Leader. He would have to use his hand every few minutes, as we do 
the foot on the kick-wheel. A modern variable-speed power-wheel has a 
maximum of about 150 revolutions a minute, but the potter keeps it slowed 
down a little most of the time. 
Eighth-grade boy. Do they purify the clay after they get it? 
Leader. Yes, it has to be “washed,” as we say. It has to be put to 
soak and then made into slip, which is strained to take out the impurities. 
Sometimes the clay is not the best for this kind of work, and other ma- 
terials have to be mixed with it. 
Sixth-grade girl. Did the Egyptian women make pottery?
-P-A-G-E-108
Year Book 107 
Leader, No, the Egyptian men made the pottery; the Egyptian women 
did some of the weaving, though not all of it. 
Fifth-grade child. How long would it take to make a jar? 
Leader. A good potter can make a jar in a few minutes, but it will 
take him longer to make a perfect and beautiful shape. . 
Second-grade child. What makes the clay go up? 
Leader. He presses on it with his hands, and the clay has to go some- 
where, so it pushes up. 
Second-grade child, Ut can’t go down, because the wheel is there. 
Third-grade child. Was the clay hollow when he put it on the wheel? 
Leader. No, it was a solid lump. 
This room that we have on the stage is not a room in the home of an 
ordinary potter. No Egyption potter of ordinary’ rank would live in a 
beautiful room like this; but many times the Egyptian potter was employed by 
rulers, or by wealthy persons of the country, to make pottery for them, This 
scene represents a room of the person who has employed the potter. The 
dado has a lotus design. The lotus is the sacred flower of Egypt, and is 
one of the symbols of the sun-god Ra, their chief deity. You can see the 
bud and two forms of the lotus flower. The design of the columns at the 
sides of the stage is taken from the lotus bud and its stem. The figure over 
the top of the stage opening is the winged globe, another sun symbol. It 
represents the sun-god Ra, in his power to go everywhere over the earth, 
as the sun sends its light to all parts of the world. This symbol is often 
used over doorways, to insure the protection of Ra for all the people of the 
house. | : 
Eighth-grade child. Wow did they fire their pottery? 
Leader. They had a kiln about as high as a man, fed with wood at the 
bottom. It had a series of shelves, but not a double cylinder, like our kiln. 
It was a single cylinder, and the flames came right up among the pots, so 
that sometimes the pottery was scorched brown, as in the case of the Indian 
pottery. 
Japanese Scene 
Leader, We have tried to show you, in the last two days, various ways 
that potters work—on Monday the early way, just using their hands, without 
the wheel, and yesterday we showed you a little of how the wheel helps in 
the making of pottery. Today, we are going to show you something about 
the decorating of it. But before we begin this scene, I want to say a few 
things about pottery work. 
It is a fascinating kind of work, but there is a good deal that is very 
laborious about it, and very trying. Some of you who have had experience, 
know how firing tries your patience. The only way it is possible for people 
to work at pottery and not find it mere drudgery, is to work with love for 
the art—with enjoyment in it. This is true not only of pottery work, but of 
all kinds of handwork. People ought to be able to do their work, not only 
because it is useful, but because they have interest in it and love for it, and 
are thinking of the beautiful thing that they are going to produce. But peo-
-P-A-G-E-109

  JAPANESE. DECORATING POTTERY 
ple cannot make beautiful things unless they see beautiful things about them. 
There is no country where the common things that the people use, the or- 
dinary home utensils, are more.beautiful than in Japan. For that reason, 
we have chosen a Japanese potter’s shop for our scene this morning. We 
have tried to represent pottery production under ideal conditions. 
(Enter master potter, r., goes to table, I. c., kneels behind it and begins 
to work, Presently enter two apprentices, 1. As they come in from the 
street, they slip off their clogs at the entrance; the master potter greets 
them, and they, too, go to work at table, r.c. Presently enter, r, master’s 
little daughter. Goes to watch him. Assistant brings her a ball to play with, 
she runs out, c. back, and is seen playing in the garden.) 
The potters in Japan formerly did, and even today in most Japanese 
villages, still do most of the pottery work in their homes. Or, the pot- 
ter’s shop where the jars are made is sometimes one house for a village, 
and the workers go to that one shop for their. shapes; that is, they get the 
potter to make the jars, and then they do the decorating in their own homes. 
They do not work in factories, except in a few of the large cities. Some- 
times the master potter has his own house, and other potters come and work 
with him. They put great care and labor into their work to make it as 
beautiful as possible. They will sometimes work months on a single piece 
to make it perfect. They plan their decorations very carefully, and then 
execute them very carefully. You know how very beautiful the Japanese jars 
are when they are finished. It is so because the artists are willing to spend 
their time and love on that kind of work. 
(Enter maid with tea service. Bows and withdraws.) 
It is a custom of the Japanese to interrupt themselves in the middle of 
the forenoon and in the middle of the afternoon to take tea, because if they 
are tired they cannot do their best work, and the tea refreshes them.
-P-A-G-E-110
YEAR Book 109 
  JAPANESE DRINKING TEA 
(Workers stop painting and gather about tea service, where the child 
Joins them, All drink. Maid comes for tea things and all return to work.) 
The art of the Japanese potter descends from father to son. The ar- 
tist’s children come and play in the shop, watch the beautiful wares being 
made, and absorb the artistic feelings of their fathers. Gradually they 
learn to help in various parts of the work, and at last become artists 
themselves. : 
While the potters are at work, if there are any questions, I will answer 
them if I can. 
(From time to time a worker gets up to study a flower, a butterfly, 
or some object that he wishes to introduce into his design.) 
Second-grade child. What are those things they had on their feet? 
Leader. They are the kind of shoes people wear in Japan. They call 
them geta, They take them off at the door of the house, because they con- 
sider it an untidy thing to come into the house wearing the shoes in which 
they walk in the street. They do not understand why we do it. They keep 
their houses very clean. All the floors are covered with straw mats. 
Fourth-grade child. Do they talk when they work? 
Leader. Yes, sometimes. They do not talk a great deal, however, for 
they know that they cannot do their best work if they chatter much. 
Seventh-grade child. Who makes the most beautiful pottery? 
Leader. That is very hard to say, because different kinds of pottery 
are beautiful in different ways. 
Fourth-grade child. What do the Japanese women do? 
Leader. Just about what our women do. They keep house, and sew, 
and make calls. The very poor Japanese women sometimes work in the 
rice fields, or on the docks. 
High-school girl. How do the Japanese fire their pottery?
-P-A-G-E-111
110 Francis W. Parker Scuoon 
Leader. They have kilns. They have saggers—fire-clay trays in. which 
they set the pottery—and they put these trays into the kiln. 
High-school girl. Do they draw from natural things? 
Leader. They do not keep the natural things directly before them, but 
they study the natural things and get inspiration from them. They draw 
from the images of these objects that they have in their minds. But they 
do not try to represent nature exactly as they see it. They arrange the 
object to fill, in the most beautiful way, the space they have to decorate. 
High-school boy. Do they make pottery on the wheel? 
Leader. Yes. In the hall there is a picture of a modern Japanese pot- 
ter at work at a wheel. They do have some electric wheels in Japan now-a- 
days, but they use the old style of wheel too. The pottery that they make 
for export is almost all cast. 
Sixth-grade girl. What kind of colors do they use? 
Leader. They use different kinds of mineral powders that they mix 
together. They use metallic oxides, just as we do. Iron rust is one of 
their colors; they make orange and brown and yellow with it; they use 
cobalt to make their blues, and manganese to make their purples. Many of 
their colors are what we call enamels. Of our three potters at work there, 
one is working on raw clay, and the other two are working on jars that 
have been fired. 
Seventh-grade girl. Do they draw their designs before they work on the 
jars? 
Leader. Only sometimes. Sometimes they draw them carefully, with 
much detail; at other times they indicate the principal lines, but put in all 
details with the mineral paint. On the cheaper wares, the drawing is done 
directly with the paint.

EXERCISES EMPHASIZING SCHOOL UNITY AND 
SCHOOL POLICIES 
The exercises under the heads of Opening Day of School, Com- 
mencement-Week Festivities, Memorial Day, and Town Meetings, are 
selected as typical exercises, to indicate means by which the school 
community is unified by discussion of common purposes and relation- 
ships; to show briefly how boys and girls are brought into contact 
with the chief principles and policies of the School; how they partici- 
pate in questions of school administration ; and how they sometimes, 
ag a school, enter into the wider activities in which older good citizens 
are interested. 
The first and last days of the year in any school are full of sig- 
nificance. On the first day in our school, every child is welcomed into 
the school family circle and made to feel himself a part of it. On the 
last day, every high-school graduate goes out knowing that he will be 
truly missed; that his progress will be followed with interest and 
affection by his teachers and schoolmates as well as by his parents. 
It is for this reason that the teachers think it worth while to give, 
verbatim, a part of a first-day exercise and a program of the com- 
mencement festivities. The examples selected are similar in form to 
all our first- and last-day exercises. They offer little, perhaps, in orig- 
inality in plan, or suggestion—they picture simply the social life of 
a school in which it seems important to the teachers that the atmos- 
phere shall be like that of a good home—intimate, warm, human— 
a place where each individual is valued for his own sake. It is just 
because these are exceedingly simple and personal gatherings, and 
because they have been effective in influence, that an account of them 
appears in this book.

go on from the place where we left off last June. You remember, the

Program for the play were some words from Colonel Parker, These ex- 
pressed the central idea of the play. I want every boy and girl to have and 
to know this quotation, for if we can put the spirit of it into our lives and 
actions, we can grow in the understanding of good citizenship right here in 
this little school; we can make of ourselves good Americans, and that is 
what we want to be—Americans in the spirit of that quotation, I am going 
to read it to you, and also two paragraphs from the same chapter of Colonel 
Parker’s book. I shall read them. because they give the keynote of the 
spirit we want here—that of freedom and responsibility. Colonel Parker 
says: 
“Let us now turn for a moment to the problem of America. We who 
are in the thick of the fight, in the midst of a struggle which is over- 
whelming, do not appreciate the tremendous trend of human affairs; the 
danger signals which fly before us are unwatched and unheeded. What are 
we proposing to do? That which has never yet been done in the world’s 
history. Foreign colonies have settled in other nations, to be ostracized, 
persecuted, oppressed, and downtrodden, but here in America we are bring- 
ing together all peoples from all parts of the known world, with all their 
prejudices born of centuries, each naturally having its own customs, rooted 
in earliest-times and growing with a national growth—the Germans and the 
French, the Italians and the Russians, the Poles and the Irish, each with their 
prejudices, with their views of life, producing different customs, political, 
social, and religious, opposed as earth and heaven, Here they come into 
our broad continent, and we propose to have them live together, and legis- 
late together for-the best good of the whole. No dream of the past, no 
vision of the progress of humanity, could ever propose such a tremendous 
problem as this—this blending and fusing of the peoples of the whole earth 
in one crucible of common interests and brotherly love.” ... 
. “The universal movement that had its beginning when the morning stars 
first sang together, was the tendency of the soul toward freedom. The 
form of government it took was democracy, founded upon the principle 
that society can rule itself; that each member of society contributes to the 
good of ail, lives for all, and receives from all that which all can give. A 
fundamental principle of democracy is the responsibility of each for all and 
all for each. If one is weak in the government, if one is weak who has the 
ballot, who has a choosing power, it means the weakness of all; and it be- 
comes the imperative duty of all to present the needed conditions to awaken 
the feeling of responsibility.” . 
“The goal of humanity is freedom. Liberty is the right of all men, 
but freedom is an individual acquirement through search of God’s laws 
and obedience to them. The possession of freedom includes every possible 
good to the possessor—happiness, citizenship, personal development, and 
ethical action. The highest personal right a community can accord to an in-
-P-A-G-E-116
YEAR Boox 115 
dividual is the liberty and the means to become free. The means of acquiring 
freedom may be summed up in one word—education. True education is the 
presentation of the condition necessary for the evolution of personality into 
freedom. Democracy is the only form of government under which the 
methods of freedom can be fostered.” 
There is no such thing in existence today as pure democracy, but we 
in this school are trying to learn what democracy is. We want to be free, 
and to learn how to use that freedom; we want to be responsible—all for 
each, each for all. Ralph, what is the great word of the School? 
Ninth-grade boy. Responsibility. 
Chairman. One of our first résponsibilities today is to make the new 
people feel that they are members of the school family. I should like to 
have all the pupils who are new in the School this morning (who have never 
been here before) stand. (All new children stand a moment.): Now you 
belong to the family. I wonder how many know the school motto? (Hands 
up.) Josephine, tell the new people our motto. 
Tenth-grade girl. “Everything to help and nothing to hinder.” 
Chairman. Now altogether. (School repeats motto.) There are four 
new members of the faculty this year—a new head of the English depart- 
ment, a teacher of oral reading, a second-grade teacher, and a secretary 
in the office. (Then followed the introduction of these new members. Each 
in turn stood and said a few words.) 
I am rather glad that we have but one minute of our time left—not 
long enough to hear from any one else. We want to know where everybody - 
has been and what everybody has done during vacation, and I am afraid 
all would want to talk at once. On Friday we shall have those who were 
at Seattle this summer tell us about the Fair and the good times they had 
there. Tomorrow morning, we shall have a divided singing rehearsal, and 
we shall expect every one to help in getting new morning-exercise songs 
ready to sing. 
(After the closing song and announcements, pupils left the hall in time 
with the music of Schubert's “Military March.”)

COMMENCEMENT FESTIVITIES 
The class poem, history, prophecy, and songs, which by tradition 
have become a part of most commencement programs, are used in a 
different way in our school. They are printed in the June number 
of the school magazine, and read either at a supper, or perhaps, as in 
June, 1910, around a campfire at a beach party. They are part of a 
frolic always given by the faculty to the graduating class. The real 
contribution of the class to the School does not come upon graduation 
day, but for a number of years it has been made the week previous 
to graduation, in the form of a carefully prepared play. 
The morning exercise on graduation day is extremely simple. It 
consists, as the following program shows, in some truly beautiful 
music, an inspiring bit of literature, an impressive word from one of 
the trustees or some one particularly qualified to express the idea 
embodied in the program, and a personal word from the principal of 
the School to each one of the graduates, with the presentation of the 
certificate.

The Senior Class Play Given in June, 1911 
THE TURN OF THE ROAD 
By RurHERFoRD WaYNE 
Note-In 1911 the play by the Senior class was given four times—the first per- 
formance at Hull House, the second, third’ and fourth performances in the School 
Assembly Hall. 
There were changes in the cast of characters for each performance as there were but ten character ats in the play and fourteen members in the Senior class.. It is 
the policy of the School that everyone in the class shall receive the training and take part in at least, one of the school performances of any play, 
The scene throughout is laid in the kitchen of William John Granahan’s 
house in the County of Down. 
A month elapses between Scenes I and II. 
Time. The present day 
Epilogue. The evening of Scene II. 
SYNOPSIS 
ACT I 
Robbie John, the younger son of an Irish farmer, has a wonderful talent 
for the fiddle, which seems to have become his very life. Only his sister, 
Ellen, a simple country girl, seems to have any sympathy for his ambitions. 
His grandfather, a kindly old gentleman, though he is very fond of Robbie, 
does not understand his taste for music, while his parents, hard-working 
farmers, who see little in life beyond the making of money, think that playing

SCENES IN THE TURN OF THE ROAD 
the fiddle is simply a waste of time, and want Robbie to give it up. Samuel 
James, the elder brother, malicious and selfish, knowing that if Robbie took 
to the fiddle he would be disinherited by his father, constantly urges Robbie . 
to continue his music and to strive to make a name for himself. In this 
atmosphere of materialism and lack of understanding, Robbie is forced to 
keep his ambition in check, and finally, realizing that by giving up the fiddle 
his love for Jane Graeme, a neighbor’s daughter, will be realized, he is 
persuaded to burn the fiddle. 
ACT IL 
A month later Robbie and Jane Graeme are engaged to be married. 
But, in spite of this, Robbie is not happy. By a strange coincidence, a tramp 
fiddler whom Robbie had befriended in the course of Act I, left a valuable 
fiddle to him, which Samuel James manages to keep before Robbie’s eyes, 
so that he may the more easily be tempted to take again to playing. But 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
Yzar Boox 119 
Jane Graeme, realizing that Robbie is unhappy, that “God had made him a 
musician and not a farmer,” sacrifices her love for Robbie and urges him to 
“take his fiddle and do what his heart tells him.” On hearing of Robbie’s 
intention, Mr. Graeme immediately breaks off the engagement, and the elder 
Granahan, in a fit of passion, disregarding the entreaties of the mother, 
drives his son from home. 
EPILOGUE 
In this scene we see the “turn of the road,” not only for Robbie, who 
now has an opportunity to realize his life work, but for the entire house- 
hold excepting Samuel James, for they all begin to see a new light— 
idealism—shining before their eyes. The father, utterly broken hearted and 
despondent, feels keenly the remorse for his sending Robbie off. The 
grandfather, in a speech full of pathos, brings his son to realize that “it is 
not money alone that makes life worth living,” and the scene closes when 
the latter leaves the door ajar, as an indication of his welcome to Robbie, 
should he choose to return home.

MEMORIAL DAY EXERCISES 
The verbatim report of the Memorial-Day exercise, May, 1910, 
is included in this group of exercises because it shows another yearly 
custom of the School. We believe that through the words and deeds 
of Colonel Parker, and of other Civil-War heroes, the pupils ‘are more 
strongly impressed than they could be through more abstract observ- 
ances of the day. The verbatim report of the exercise for 1912-is not 
given, but the picture suggests how the same purpose was carried out 
with the help of a number of Civil-War soldiers. 
Morning Exercise—Memorial Day 
Friday, May 27, 1910 
Song. “Star Spangled Banner.” 
Principal. I hope that every one, even the youngest here, knows some- 
thing of the purpose of Memorial Day—that day set apart to honor the 
heroes of the Civil War who gave their lives for their country. Because 
they were willing to settle a great question at the cost of life itself, the 
great unified nation of America is possible. 
We should remember, not only on this day, but every day, that our 
nation owes its birth and its unity to a high democratic ideal; to a spirit of 
self-sacrifice. Only the preservation of that spirit can keep safe what has been 
so dearly won. 
The responsibility for unselfish devotion and patriotism rests upon each 
one of us. We must be trained to understand what was gained by the Revo- 
lution and the Civil War. © 
True patriotism does not mean getting power, so that we may have the 
best for ourselves and our friends; it does not mean the securing of special 
privileges for the North, the South, the East or the West; it does not mean, 
even, the seeking to make America great at the expense of other nations. 
I believe it means that we should try to make America the symbol for justice 
and right dealing, for world-wide sympathies, for tolerance, for the principle 
underlying the universal brotherhood of man. 
You may wonder why we select this day for our Memorial Day for 
Colonel Parker. It has become a custom not only because he was one of 
the Civil War heroes (seriously wounded and knowing the terrible cost and 
suffering of war), but more because he passionately desired that the School 
should teach the spirit of fellowship and understanding which would make war 
unnecessary. He believed there was a better way than war to settle 
differences. : 
Each Memorial Day at the old Normal School, he brought together all 
the old soldiers that he could muster, to impress upon us the full significance 
120
-P-A-G-E-122
YeEar Boox 121 
of the awful struggle which ended in 1865, and which he believed might have 
been averted if people had understood each other better—had been more con- 
siderate of the needs and rights of all. 
Of these old soldiers few are now living, and we believe that we cannot 
honor them, living or dead, in any better way than by trying to teach the 
lesson that Colonel Parker wanted us to learn, that of “each for all and all 
for each.” We believe that his own life illustrates and impresses this lesson. 
Today we shall hear two of the many poems that he loved to read to 
us. They carry their own message. We shall then sing the “Battle Hymn 
of the Republic,” which’ we have all learned to associate with Colonel Parker. 
After that, members of the High School will interpret, each in his own way, 
part of Colonel Parker’s life and teachings. 
Reading (fourth-grade teacher). “Each and All’—Emerson. 
Recitation, Hildegarde (seventh-grade). “The Children”—Longfellow. 
Reading of Essay on Colonel Parker. Harold (eleventh-grade). 
Note--This essay was the best and most important contribution to the exercise but 
on account of its length, it had to be omitted from this book, 
Charlotte (tenth-grade). Colonel Parker thought the be-all and end-all 
of education was social efficiency, and that there was no use in educating 
people, if they could not be of use. His ideal was an unselfish human being, 
and he thought that the school should teach every one to be as unselfish as 
possible. When a little child first comes to school, it is very apt to be 
’ thoroughly selfish. It talks when it wants to, and walks around, and does 
much as it pleases. But it must learn not to talk except when it is called 
upon, and so it comes to regard the task as the unit that-it must work for. 
Then in time the child grows more mature and learns that it really is not the 
task that counts, but the grade, and after that it is the school that he works 
for, and finally for the whole world. One must learn to work for the good 
of all and not for selfish purposes. Colonel Parker says that those people 
who have worked for their own ends, special ends, we do not remember; 
that it is the people who have worked for mankind at large who are 
always remembered and loved; that “the memory of Alexander, Cesar, 
Napoleon,--although they were indirectly of. great use in progress—and all 
honor is given them,—is cold and dead in human hearts; while the exalted 
lives of Socrates, Froebel, Pestalozzi, Horace Mann, John Bright, Florence 
Nightingale, Washington, and the greatest of all, Lincoln, will ever be bright 
and pure, the beacon-lights of mankind.” Colonel Parker himself was that 
sort of a man; he was unselfish, and his work was for the good of all. This 
is what he said in one section of his book, “Talks on Pedagogics” : 
“T have said these words ‘with malice toward none and charity for all’ 
Fighting for four years, as best I could, for the preservation of the demo- 
cratic ideal, a teacher of little children for nearly forty years, I believe four 
things as I believe in God—that democracy is the one hope of the world; 
that democracy without efficient common schools is impossible; that every 
school in the land should be made a home and a heaven for children; that 
when the ideal of the public school is realized ‘the blood shed by the blessed 
martyrs for freedom and will not have been shed in vain’ ”
-P-A-G-E-123
122 Francis W. Parker ScHoou 
Loraine (tenth-grade). Colonel Parker, as Charlotte has told us, be- 
lieved that education should have social service as its highest aim, and the 
question is—how are we to attain social efficiency? 
Social service, as we understand it, consists in making our own lives 
and characters of the greatest possible benefit to others. We can become 
efficient for social service by having for our aim the good of all, putting 
self aside, and considering always the whole. We should be attentive, should 
not interrupt, should be quiet and punctual, in order to conduce to the good 
of the School. Colonel Parker says over and over again, “Each for all, 
and all for each.” . 
In our recitations there should be an effort not only to bring knowledge 
to the one reciting, but an effort to benefit the whole. It should be an 
effort in common, each contributing his share to the lesson, Our constant 
thought should be for the comforts and rights of others. How much better 
is this way of carrying on our school work than the strife for prizes or 
marks,—each one trying to outdo the other in gaining approbation from the 
teacher. This causes jealousy and general bad feeling among the pupils. If 
this method of work were followed, the love among us would be destroyed. 
Colonel Parker says: “Great force of character or genius, combined 
with selfishness, inordinate ambition, and all-controlling avarice, leads often 
to great political power, to wealth, to bloody victories, but beyond it can- 
not lead.” : 
In connection with the Civil War, he says: “If the people of the North 
and South had known each other in 1861 as they do now; if they had been 
bound together by railroads and telegraphs as in 1894, no power on earth 
could have led them to drencli the land in fratricidal blood. The foundation 
of most evil is misunderstanding, distrust, repulsion, or hate—the baneful 
products of isolation. People, in order to love each other and work for 
each other, must live together in communities, must be bound together by 
common interests.” 
“Our coming together in the morning exercise period, and our being 
bound together by common interests, is a direct training in citizenship—in 
the habit of working for the best good of the whole.” And again he says: 
“There never was a bit of true art, music, song, painting, or poetry, destined 
to immortality, that did not spring from inspiration born of love.” 
To become efficient in social service, it is very necessary that each one 
work out alone his or her own problems. “Every step in personal develop- 
ment is through original inference and its practical application. No human 
being can find a truth for another; the highest aim should be to discover 
conditions that will enable others to reason in the right direction. The com- 
mand is, ‘Work out your own salvation’ ” 
Colonel Parker left for us our great word, “Responsibility.” If we try 
to live up to the things which that word stands for, we shall not only be 
helpful members of our school, but in later life, we shall be helpful to the 
society in which we may be ‘placed. In order to help society in the best way, 
our love must be broad, and our responsibility unselfish in spirit. It seems
-P-A-G-E-124
Year Boor 123 
to me that we get a great inspiration from Colonel Parker’s words which were 
brought out by last year’s class in the “Melting Pot.” 
Principal. Our exercises have been long enough, but they would not 
be complete without a word of encouragement which comes from the reports 
of the social work which our graduates are doing. In the “Commencement 
Recorder” you wilt find the details of some of their work, but I think you 
would like to know that ten members of the Alumni have found time, while 
maintaining their scholorship standards, to enter actively into some form of 
social service outside of their regular college duties. 
We do not doubt that there are others of the school family whose work 
deserves mention because of its practical usefulness in the community to which 
each belongs. The work need not necessarily be of a kind one can observe 
and measure. 
All who are working unselfishly for good purposes have entered the path 
of social service. It is a path full of hard work and sacrifice, yet we rejoice, 
for it is this path, preeminently, which leads to the greatest happiness and 
satisfaction which the human spirit knows—that of being of genuine service 
in the world.

TOWN MEETINGS 
The “Town Meeting,” so-called, is held occasionally in the morn- 
ing-exercise period, and is devoted to free discussion of rules and 
regulations or of wider civic projects affecting the school community. 
Among the questions considered at the town meetings have been the 
following: , 
Conduct in Morning Exercises. 
Need for Rules for Securing Necessary Quiet in the Halls. 
Adoption of School Courtesy Code. 
Regulations for School Parties. 
The Creation of a School Membership in the Big Brother and 
Sister League. 
The Taking Part as a School in the Saving of Niagara Falls. 
The Formation of School Humane Societies. 
Pupils from the fifth through the twelfth grades take part in the 
town meeting discussions. Sometimes the chairman of a committee 
of pupils presents the question for discussion and -gives the report of 
the committee. 
The meetings have always stimulated a sense of social responsi- 
bility and have resulted in a better attitude, and always in a sincere 
even if short-lived attempt to live up to the higher standards pre- 
sented. The full possibility of this form of exercise has not been 
realized—the children have responded actively and cheerfully to all 
demands, but they have not, as yet, taken the initiative to any great 
extent in asking for such meetings and discussions. Parts of two 
town meetings on morning exercises are given verbatim, because they 
are typical of the character of the discussions carried on in such meet- 
ings, and because they are directly related to the subject-matter of 
this Year Boor. : 
: Morning Exercise—Town Meeting 
October 13, 1905 
Associate Principal, For four years now-we have had these morning ex- 
ercises, and all of you, when you are asked, are more than willing to take 
part, but the teachers have been responsible. It seems to me the time has 
come for you to take up the work, and initiate things for yourselves. I 
think the plans for morning exercises ought to come from you and that 
the people who are to take part ought to he selected by you. I suggest that 
124
-P-A-G-E-126
Yuar Boox 125 
a comtnittee of pupils be appointed to select the subjects and carry out the 
plans. 
Douglas (tenth grade). I think that is a splendid idea, and I suggest that 
a committee of pupils be appointed for a while to select the subjects and 
carry out the plans themselves. I think the pupils would then take an 
active interest in the work. I think that not only the High School should 
have a part in the morning exercises, but that every grade ought to con- 
tribute—every pupil in the grades should have a part. I don’t mean every 
day,, but I-don’t think the exercises should be confined to the High School. 
I think every grade should have a part in it sometime. 
Charlotte (eighth grade). I think that such a committee ought not to be 
from the High School, but that the high-school pupils ought to work with 
the children from the grades. 
Emmons (tenth grade). Would it not be better for each grade to have 
a committee and the teacher from that grade help out on the exercise? 
1 think it would be better than to have a committee for the whole school. 
Beatrice (twelfth grade). Why not have one member of the committee 
from each grade, and have each in that grade suggest to him what he wants 
to do? 
Fanny (twelfth grade). I think the pupils who have taken an interest 
in the exercise today would be a good committee, but we need time to think 
about it. 
(New topic introduced as to what pupils enjoy in morning exercise.) 
Elmer (tenth grade). 1 enjoy the morning exercises when different peo- 
ple from around the country come and talk to us. 
Katherine (twelfth grade). I think one of the most interesting morning 
exercises is when the little children take part. It is nice to know what they 
are doing and what they are thinking about. 
Joe (tenth grade). 1 don’t care much about that; it doesn’t seem to 
interest me, TI like the exercises that Elmer does, where people from around 
the country come and talk to us. . 
Elmer (tenth grade). But I think it is our duty to come even when we 
don’t enjoy it. It gives the little people a chance to talk before an audience, 
and that is always a good thing. 
Clarence (eleventh grade). The little children say a lot of things that 
they feel more than the older ones do. 
Emmons (tenth grade). I like the morning exercises. It shows us what 
the other grades do, and I think we ought to know because we hardly—at least 
T hardly ever look in to see what they are doing in other rooms. 
Katherine (twelfth grade). I think that some of the most interesting 
exercises are the plays that we have had—just acting out a little story. 
Gene (twelfth grade). I think that one of the differences between the 
exercises here and at the Normal School is that there they were always pre- 
“pared, and the exercises here are sometimes just what we think about at the 
time. I didn’t care much for the morning exercises at the Normal,

Morning Exercise—Town Meeting 
October 26, 1905 
(Fifth Grade through High School) 
Charlotte (eighth grade). At the last meeting it was suggested that a 
committee be appointed to arrange for morning exercises. Claudine thinks 
that instead of having the committee arrange for the morning exercises, 
the people who want the exercises should arrange for them and then come 
to the committee and see when they can have them. 
Elizabeth (eleventh grade). I should think that each of the grades ought 
to have a committee and let the committee for each grade decide on the 
date for the various exercises. 
Elliot (tenth grade). That is just about what we have been doing. There 
has been a bulletin that said that on each day some teacher would give 
a morning exercise. That is just what has been done, and it has not been 
a success. 
Winifred (eleventh grade). 1 think each grade should be represented, 
and then we could ask the teachers for their advice. 
Katherine (twelfth grade). I think it would be well to have one of the 
teachers on the committee until we get started. They have had more ex- 
perience and have better judgment. 
Eighth grade teacher. We have a committee of teachers who have been 
working very long hours on these very things. I think that many of you 
would like to hear the report of this committee on what they consider the 
great principles involved in the morning exercises. The first is: “The suc- 
cess of the morning exercises is fundamentally dependent upon a good com- 
munity-spirit in all the classes.” What do you think that means? 
Chester (twelfth grade). What I think you mean is that instead of the 
morning exercises being formal, some certain people saying a lot of things 
that they have prepared, that each one is to say what he has to say and not 
be afraid, and that everything, no matter what it is, should be of interest to 
everybody else. 
Elizabeth (eleventh grade). It seems to me to mean that everybody puts 
in his efforts for the whole body of children, and not each individual for 
himself, so that everyone will get the benefit of it, 
A teacher read the rest of the report but there were no further remarks 
by the pupils. 
Elliot. I do not think a committee such as has been suggested could 
have exercises every morning in the week—I believe it would be a little too 
much to get ready. I know in our debating society it is hard to find sub- 
jects, and it only comes every two weeks. If we had a committee of teachers 
it would help us very greatly. 
Elizabeth. As I understand it, the committee was not to decide, but to 
let each grade select its subject. I think a good way to do would be to 
have the whole school feel the responsibility of the morning exercises and 
consider themselves a committee, and when they have somiething to: give, 
put it down for a specified time.

Elmer (eleventh grade). Is that the object of the committee—just to 
keep the calendar? Suppose, when the calendar was submitted to the com- 
mittee, there were five or six open mornings in the month, would be it sen- 
sible for the committee to try to fill them? Could the committee ask anybody 
to be responsible at any time? 
Charlotte. I think the whole school ought to be together every morning. 
It seems to me it would be a good thing for the committee to have some 
general subjects which would be interesting to every one, and if there was 
an open morning, just go around and announce it to the different grades 
and have them think about it. 
Paul (eleventh grade). 1 think we ought to have a representative from 
each grade in the School and some of the teachers. Hold the whole school 
responsible for the exercises and then the committee could make arrange- 
ments for the open mornings. - 
Beatrice (twelfth grade). I think that two committees would be rather 
confusing. I should think we could have a smaller committee, say six, three 
teachers, and three of the pupils from the upper grades—one from the fifth, 
one from the sixth, and one from the seventh, and then two others, one from 
the eighth grade, and one from the High School. Have the grades them- 
selves elect the committee, and have the committee changed from time to 
time, so that everyone would have a chance to work. 
Lucy (fifth grade). I think it would be better to just have one commit- 
tee; have the whole school suggest and the committee carry it out. 
Gene (twelfth grade). I would have the children from the fifth grade 
up elect these members of the committee, no matter from what grade they 
were elected. What we are working for, is to make everyone responsible for 
the morning exercises, I make a motion that three representatives be elected 
by the grades, from the fifth grade up, and that three members of the fac- 
ulty be elected by the faculty, and that this committee of six arrange all the 
dates for the morning exercises and all the school be responsible for the 
subjects. 
(This motion was seconded and carried.)

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SPECIAL DAYS 
  
The various aspects of the spirit which is the moving power of 
the school life are represented during the.course of the year in the 
special exercises. Daily morning exercises are the outcome of some 
particular interest of a group or an individual; but special exercises 
stand for certain conceptions which give inspiration to the life of the 
community and determine its characteristic direction and qualities. 
All special exercises have the backing of tradition of some sort. It 
may be one of our deep-seated racial traditions which supplies the 
suggestion of validity for the celebration, or it may be a mere school 
tradition which gives sanction to the content and form of the exer- 
cise. Both sorts are opportunities for the clarification of ideals and 
the expression of beliefs held by the community as a whole. Year by 
year they restate and verify the spiritual aspect of growth, giving it 
expression in the most beautiful and appropriate forms we can com- 
mand. 
Christmas, Thanksgiving, patriotic days, stand for love, for the 
impulse of gratitude, for national spirit; it is the renewed discovery by 
the individual, year by year, of stability and unity in our spiritual 
life, symbolized by these exercises, which gives them their greatest 
value. Field Day is a general exercise of prime importance, when the 
gymnastic work of the year culminates in a whole day given to cele- 
brate our belief in the scientific and regular training of the body. 
On May Day we express, in more or less traditional forms, some of 
the sentiments to which our Anglo-Saxon inheritance, entitles us. It 
is a day greatly beloved by the children, both old and young. The 
St. Valentine’s-Day observance resolves itself into a party, in which 
every one receives some token of affection. Hallowe’en is the day for 
fairies and elves; songs, stories, games and plays, in which the imag- 
ination is appealed to in all of the fun-making, tend to redeem this 
degenerated holiday for the children. 
The Commencement-Day exercises are described in another place 
in the book, under the heading, “School Unity and School Policies.”

CHRISTMAS EXERCISES 
The Spirit of Giving 
- In preparation for Christmas, 1912, the following letter was sent 
to patrons and friends of the Parker School: 
The School is this year making a greater effort than ever before to 
impress upon the children the beauty of the Christmas spirit. The children 
have heard Tolstoy’s story, “Where Love Is, There God Is Also,” and 
throughout the month we hope to keep before them the essential meaning of 
the Christmas season—that it is a time of kindly feeling towards one’s fel- 
lows. We should be glad if not one child saw any of its unlovely features 
—hurry, worry, ostentation, perfunctory giving. We wish. every child to 
feel that a gift is nothing unless genuine affection prompts it—nothing, un- 
less into it the giver has put a part of himself. The giver’s own work is 
of course the best, but at least careful, thoughtful selection is indispensable. 
This means that a child should be allowed to give very few gifts. 
We believe that you will agree with us that Christmas “lists” by means 
of which the parents meet large responsibilities in a business-like way, have 
no rightful place in the child’s growing years, if we are to preserve the 
true spirit of Christmas giving. We are very anxious to have no Christmas 
gifts given in the School which are in any way forced or suggested, and 
school collections for presents often have this result. We ask you to co- 
operate with us in having the children understand that if they have not the 
time or inclination to give in the right way, Christmas gifts in the School, 
that what they really can give of themselves in helpful influence, in service, 
is even more appreciated and often represents more genuine giving. 
We hope that it will be understood that we want to encourage and help 
in every possible way the true spirit of giving, but we want to remove those 
artificial incentives to universal exchange of Christmas gifts which mar this 
season of good-fellowship and place upon children, prematurely, the burden 
of adult responsibility. Let us keep our children natural, simple and genuine, 
and protect them as long as possible from the sophistication which certainly 
has no place in the Christmas festival. 
Believing that every parent will understand the spirit of this appeal for 
co-operation, we are 
Yours most sincerely, 
Committse on CHRISTMAS GIVING. 
The foregoing letter indicates that in common with all thoughtful 
adults, our teachers believe that the matter of Christmas giving merits 
our serious attention. We desire to keep all the beauty of the Christ- 
mas spirit, and combat all the unwholesome tendencies of extravagance 
and ostentation which present-day conditions enhance. The morning

exercise is an ever-ready avenue for exercising positive influence upon 
the School as a whole in any such matter as this. Mrs. Thomsen read 
to the children Tolstoy’s “Where Love Is.” The reading was very 
moving to the susceptible minds of the eighth-grade boys and girls. 
Later in the year they gave a play which they had made from the 
story—the play which concludes this article. This study was under- 
taken at the instance of the children—that is, their suggestion that 
they make a play from the story was adopted tentatively, in the hope 
that a prolonged study of such a piece of literature would insensibly 
imprint upon their characters some of the sweet and gentle Christ- 
like spirit. But this plan was, in the teacher’s mind, as I say, tenta- 
tive. The great religious experience of this lonely cobbler in his little 
basement-shop had inspired in the children a deep reverence. Could 
they maintain that reverence through daily hard work on the style and 
composition? The story covers several weeks before the great day 
when Christ himself visited Martuin. All this they must bring into 
the compass of one day and one scene. Much that is told as narrative 
they had to turn into dialogue. They must read other of the Gospel 
stories to find Tolstoy’s own eloquently simple phrases. They must 
try to imitate his folk-expression where wholly new sentences were 
needed. Martuin’s first three speeches and others through the play 
were made in this way. 
For this class such work meant many hours of concentration of 
an unusual sort. Symptoms of flippancy or boredom would mean a 
reaction, and were watched for by the teacher. Such symptoms would 
be a signal for abandoning the work. No such signal came. 
When the play was finished, parts must be assigned and rehear- 
sals begun. These children were unusually inexpressive. Their speech 
was appallingly unlovely. We were planning several performances, 
so that every child had a part, and must share in the drudgery of 
constant rehearsal, with hard drill for clear beautiful speech and easy, 
natural action. Was their love for the play they had chosen to make 
sufficient to lift this drudgery to a piece of service? The event proved 
that it was. : 
I recall a discussion in rehearsal which seems to me significant. 
In the story, Christ himself spoke to Martuin, saying: “Look to- 
morrow on the street. I am coming.” The question was whether the 
audience should hear Christ speaking, or whether only the poor cob- 
bler’s action and facial expression should convey the impression. Their
-P-A-G-E-135
1384 Franois W. Parker ScHoon 
choice of the latter alternative was a triumph of good taste, but I 
speak of it because the tone of the discussion was so naive and so 
sincere. 
Work on making the play began before Christmas. There were 
four performances, including one at the Child Welfare Exhibit in 
June. All this work was done on a solemnly religious type of story. 
It must have been abandoned had so high a plane of feeling proved 
impossible for so extended a time. The gentleness and reverence with 
which the whole, class regarded it showed conclusively that it was a — 
type of literature wonderfully adapted to the adolescent age. 
“Where Love Is” 
(Cobbler’s shop. Two men seated, talking.) 
Ivan. God keep you, Martuin, I must start back to Troitsa in a few 
hours. ° 
Martuin. Ivan Dmiettrievitch, do not go. I am a lonely man. I sit 
here in my little basement-shop. I look out through my window to the street. 
All day I see only boots passing by. The rest of the people is hidden. But 
by the boots, which I have made and mended, I recognize the owners. Yon- 
der, now, goes a water-carrier. But only to see boots passing. What kind 
of a life is that? Do not leave me. 
Ivan. Martuin, you are changed. Seven years ago you were a happy 
man. 
Martuin. Seven years ago I had a wife and child. 
Ivan. These things are in God’s hands, Martuin. 
Martuin. My little Kapitoshka! He was the last. When my wife died, 
my sister would have taken him. But I felt sorry for him. I said: “It will 
be hard for my little Kapitoshka to live in a strange family. I shall keep 
him with me.” Why could not God have taken me, an old man, instead of 
my beloved only son! 
Ivan. But Martuin— 
Martuin. I have no desire to live. I only wish I was dead. That is all 
I pray God for. I am a man without anything to hope for now. 
Ivan, You don’t talk right, Martuin. We must not judge God’s doings. 
The world moves not by your skill, but by God’s will, God decreed for your 
son to die—for you to live. Consequently, it is for the best. And you are 
in despair because you wish to live for your own happiness. 
Martuin. But what shall one live for? 
Ivan. We must live for God, Martuin. He gives you life, and for His 
sake you must live. When you begin to live for Him, you will not grieve 
over anything, and ail will seem easy to you. 
Mariuin. But how can one live for the sake of God? 
Ivan, Christ has taught us how to live for God. You know how to read. 
Take your Testament and read it; there you will learn how to live for God. 
Everything is explained there. (Goes to shelf and takes down Bible. Sits 
and slowly turns pages.)  Listen—

YzEaR Book . 135 
“And one of the Pharisees desired Him that He should eat with him 
and He went into the Pharisee’s house and sat down to meat. And, behold, 
a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at 
meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment. 
“And she stood at His feet behind Him, weeping, and began to wash His 
feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed 
His feet and anointed them with the ointment. 
“Now when the Pharisee which had bidden Him saw it, he spake within 
himself, saying, ‘This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who 
and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him; for she is a sinner,’ 
And Jesus, answering, said unto him, ‘Simon, I have somewhat to say unto 
thee.’ And he saith, ‘Master, say on.’ 
“There was a certain creditor which had two debtors; the one owed 
five hundred pence and the other. fifty. And when they had nothing to pay, 
he frankly forgave them both. Tell me, therefore, which of them will love 
him most?’ 
“Simon answered and said, ‘I suppose that he, to whom he forgave 
most.’ 
“And He said unto him, ‘Thou hast rightly judged.’ 
“And He turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, “Seest thou this 
woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet; 
but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of 
her head. Thou gavest me no kiss, but this woman, since the time I came 
in, hath not ceased to kiss-my feet. My head with oil thou dids’t not anoint, 
but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. Wherefore, I say 
unto thee, her sins, which were many, are forgiven, for she loved much; 
but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.’” 
God keep you Martuin! (Mariuin is lost in thought and does not notice 
Ivan as he stops reading. Ivan watches his friend for a moment and then 
rises and lays the Bible, open, on the bench beside him. He goes. After 
a pause, Martuin takes up the Bible and reads to himself. Presently he reads 
aloud to himself.) 
Martuin. “Thou gavest me no water for my feet, thou gavest me no 
kiss; my head with oil thou didst not anoint.” 
(Long pause, while he reads to himself. He looks up, as if he heard 
voice.) 
Who is here? (Pauses and listens.) Christ Himself will visit me today? 
(Pauses—ihinking.) Well, such things have been. (Works and watches 
window.) Pshaw! I must be getting crazy in my old age. Stephanuitch is 
clearing away the snow, and I imagine that Christ is coming to see me. I 
was entirely out of my head, old dotard that Iam. I will give him some tea. 
By the way, the samovar must be boiling by this time. 
(Lays down his awl; rises from his seat; puts samovar on table; makes 
the tea; taps on the window. Beckons to Stephanuitch.) 
Come in and warm yourself a little. You must be cold. 
Steph. May Christ reward you for this. My bones ache. - - 
Martuin. Don’t trouble to wipe your feet. I will clean it up myself. We 
are used to such things. Come in and sit down. Drink a cup of tea. (Filling 
both his own cup and his guest's.) 
Steph. You have plenty to do, Martuin Avdyeitch? 
Martuin. Yes. People’s shoes must be mended.
-P-A-G-E-137
136 Franois W. Parker ScHoo. 
Steph. And they like to come to you. You always keep your word. 
Mariuin, One must try to be honest, Stephanuitch. 
Steph. You keep looking through the window. Are you expecting any- 
one? 
Mariuin. Am I expecting anyone? I am ashamed even to tell whom I 
expect. I am, and I am not, expecting some one. But one word has im- 
pressed itself upon my heart. Whether it is a dream or something else, I 
do not know. Don’t you see, brother, I was reading yesterday the Gospel 
about Christ, the Batiushka; how He suffered; how He walked on earth. I 
suppose you have heard about it? 
Steph. Indeed I have, but we are people in darkness; we can’t read. 
Mariuin. Well, now, I was reading about that very thing—how he 
walked upon the earth. I read, you know, how he came to the Pharisee’s, 
and the Pharisee did tiot treat him hospitably. Well, and so, my brother, 
I was reading yesterday about this very thing, and was thinking to myself 
how he did not receive Christ, the Batiushka, with honor. If, for example, 
he should come to me, or any one else, I think to myself, I should not even 
know how to receive him. And he gave him no reception at all, Well, 
while I was thus thinking, I fell asleep, brother, and I heard someone call 
me by name. I got up, the voice, just as though some one whispered, said: 
“Be on the watch, I shall come tomorrow.” And this happened twice. 
Well, would you believe it, it got into my head. I scold myself, and yet I 
am expecting him, the Batiushka. You see, I have an idea that when the 
Batiushka went about on this earth, he disdained no one, and had more to 
do with the simple people. He always went to see our simple people. He 
picked ‘out his disciples more from among our brethren—sinners like our- 
selves, from the working class. He says: “He who exalts himself shall be 
humbled, and he who is humble, shall become exalted.” “You,” says he, 
“call me Lord, and I,” says he, “wash your feet.” “Whoever wishes,” 
says he, “to be first, the same shall be servant to all. Because,” says he, 
“blessed are the poor and humble, the kind, the generous.” 
Come, now, have some more tea. 
(Stephanuitch makes sign of cross, turns up his glass, and rises.) 
Steph. Thanks to you, Martuin Avdyeitch, for treating me so kindly, and 
satisfying me, soul and body. 
Mariuin. You are welcome. Come in again. Always glad to see a 
friend. . 
(Stephanuitch goes out, Martuin, working, lqoks out of the window again. 
Sees woman and child. Gets up and goes to door.) 
Hey, my good woman! Why are you standing in the cold with the 
child? Come into. my room, where it is warm. You can manage it better. 
Right in this way. (Woman enters, carrying baby.) There, sit down, my 
good woman, nearer to the stove. You can get warm and nurse the child. 
(She sits.) 
Woman. I have no milk for him. I myself have not eaten anything 
since morning. 
(Martuin stariled, sets a bowl of soup on the table.)
-P-A-G-E-138
Year Boox 137 
Martuin. Sit down and eat. (She sits and eats.) Haven't you any 
warm clothes? 
Woman. Now is the time, friend, to wear warm clothes, but yesterday 
I pawned my last shawl for a twenty-kopec piece. When I started out this 
morning, it was warm, but now it is terribly cold. (Mariuin goes to the 
cupboard and takes out a coat.) 
Martuin. Na! It is a poor thing, yet you may turn it to some use. 
Woman. May Christ bless you! He must have sent me to your win- 
dow. I am a soldier’s wife. It is now seven months since they sent my hus- 
band off, and no tidings. I lived out as a cook. The baby was born. No 
one cared to keep me with the child. This is the third month that I have 
been struggling along without a place. I ate up ali I had. 
Martuin. We have all tasted hunger, we poor. It is a terrible thing. 
Woman. 1 have just been to the merchant’s wife, and they promised to 
take us in. I thought this was the end of it, but she told me to come next 
week. I got tired out. She lives a long way off. My little one would have 
frozen to death. And He, the Lord Himself, ted me to look through your 
window and you to take pity on me. 
Mariuiw. Indeed he did that. I have been looking through the window, 
my good woman, not without cause. I am expecting Christ. You see, this 
morning, only a little while ago, I heard a voice. You know, I had been 
reading about Christ when he was on earth, and how the rich Pharisee 
desired the Lord to eat with him. And then he thought about himself, and 
there was not the least care taken of his guest. And who was his guest? The 
Lord, Himself. And I was wondering. If He had come to me, should I 
have done the same way? And then, my friend,—I myself do not know 
whether I was dreaming or awake—I heard a voice call me, and it whis- 
pered in my ear, “I am coming.” And so I have been stitching all day, and 
at the same time looking through the window. I keep thinking of Christ 
and his deeds. And you will think I am foolish, but I am expecting him, 
the Batiushka. 
Woman. All things are possible. (Rises to go.) 
Martuin, Take this, for Christ’s sake. (Gives her money.) Redeem 
your shawl. 
Woman. May the Lord bless you! (Leaves.) Martuin sits down to 
work. 
(Enter old woman. Sets apple basket near the door, while she shows a 
pair of shoes to Martuin.) : 
Old Woman. Good day, neighbor Martuin, 
Martuin. Good day to you. What is it? 
Old Woman. My daughter’s old shoes. Can you mend them once more? 
She needs new ones, but bread is dear. God help the poor. . 
Martuin, Well, it can be done. 
(Boy reaches in and snatches apple. Old woman catches him, and drags 
him down the steps.)

Boy. 1 didn’t take it. What are you licking me for?

Marituin, Let him go, babushka. Forgive him for Christ’s sake. 
Old Woman. 1 will forgive him, so that he won’t forget it till the new 
broom grows. I am going to take the little villain to the police. 
Martuin. Let him go, babushka, he will never do it again. Let him 
go, for Christ’s sake. (Old woman lets go of boy.) 
Martuin (to boy). Ask the babushka’s forgiveness, and don’t you ever 
do it again. I saw you take the apple. 
Boy (crying). Forgive me, babushka. 
Martuin. That’s right, and now, here’s an apple for you. (Gets an 
apple from basket and gives it to the boy.) I will pay you for it, babushka. 
Old Woman. You ruin them that way, the good for nothing. He ought 
to be treated so that he will remember it for a whole week. 
Martuin. Eh, babushka, babushka, that is right, according to our judg- 
ment, but never according to God’s. If he is to be whipped for an apple, 
then what do we deserve for our sins? Remember the parable of the man 
who forgave a debtor all that he owed him, and how the debtor went out 
and began to choke one who owed him. God commanded us to forgive, 
else we, too, may not be forgiven. All should be forgiven, the thoughtless 
especially. , 
Old Woman. That's so, but the trouble is that they are very much spoiled. 
Mariwin. Then we who are older must teach them. 
Old Woman. That’s just what I say. I myself had seven of. them. 
Only one daughter is left. Here my strength is only so so, and yet I have 
to work. I pity the youngsters, my grandchildren. How nice they are! No 
one gives me such a welcome as they do. Little Aksintka won’t go to 
anyone but me. Of course it is a childish trick. God be with him. 
(Woman just about to lift bag to her shoulder.) 
Boy. Let me carry it, babushka.- It is on my way. 
Martuin, That’s right. 
Old Woman, That gives my old bones a rest. (They leave.) 
(Martuin goes back into the house. Takes lamp, lights it, works. Turns 
boot around, Looks at it. Puts it away. Takes Testament.) 
Mariuin. But the Lord, he did not visit me. (Reads half aloud, very 
slowly), “For 1 was anhungered and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty and 
ye gave me drink. I was a stranger and ye took me in; naked and ye 
clothed me; I was sick and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came 
unto me. . . . Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye have done it unto 
the least of these, my brethren, ye have done it unto me.” (Looks up from 
the Bible and repeats.) “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of 
these, my brethren, ye have done it unto me.” (Joyfully, to himself.) Then 
my dream did not deceive me. It was the Lord who visited me. 
Santa Claus Party 
The Year Book of June, 1912, contained an account of the 
Christmas Toy-Shop and its service in promoting unselfishness in the 
children by their sharing with others. That work was continued and — 
additional interest was given to it the following Christmas.
-P-A-G-E-140
Yxar Book 139 
December 4, 1912, a messenger came to Miss Cooke at morning 
exercises, with a Marconigram (on regulation blank) from Santa 
Claus at Kondiak, North Pole. (The message was really sent by 
one of the boys from his amateur station at home and received at the 
School.) In this message, Santa Claus asked the privilege of renting 
the shop of the School for two weeks, and the terms, if the request 
could be granted. The children listened with delight and enthusias- 
tically endorsed Miss Cooke’s reply that the School would gladly lease 
the shop on Santa’s own terms and would sign the contract. The 
wireless next morning brought Santa’s answer that the contract was 
on the way, and that he was so rushed with business that he wished 
to order additional dolls, dolls’ beds, sheets, mattresses, and sleds. 
This extra work was promised and included in the contract signed by 
Miss Cooke. The next two weeks were busy ones. All the primary 
grades worked on the promised extras. The first and second grades 
made simple candies, which were to serve as gifts, and the jellies and 
grape juice made in the fall were inspected. These were found in 
good condition, fit for the mother’s gift. The children of the gram- 
mar grades could not be invited to the Santa Claus party, to their 
bitter disappointment, because of the lack of space in the gymnasium, 
but they wished to have a share in the preparation, and during the last 
week of the term, as there was opportunity, they came to the domes- 
tie-science kitchen and popped corn in sufficient quantity to supply 
the children of the primary grades. Other children made packages 
of the corn by wrapping it in paper napkins and tying the packages 
with gaily-colored string. These were counted out by grades, and 
generous allowance made for probable visiting children; and the sup- 
ply for each grade was put into a large green or red stocking, plainly 
marked. These in turn were placed in Santa Claus’ huge pack, this 
being done that each child might receive a gift from Santa Claus. 
The kindergarten children bad much pleasure in trimming a 
small tree with bright ornaments. They put on it some of the smaller 
gifts chosen from those which they had planned to send with the tree 
to the children’s hospital. : 
The high-school graduating class and the eighth grade were in- 
vited to the Christmas party with the four lower grades and the kin- 
dergarten. They assembled in the gymnasium, where the gay little 
kindergarten tree was placed in the middle of the floor. As always 
there were guests, younger brothers, sisters, cousins, friends, who
-P-A-G-E-141
140 Francis W. Parker ScHooL 
sat down with the children of the school on the rugs around the room. 
The feeling of good-fellowship was most contagious, and the small 
guests were as much at home as our own children. 
The children danced in groups around the tree, there were skip- 
ping games, and then jolly Christmas songs. During the singing of 
St. Nicholas, the faint tinkle of sleigh bells was heard. The effect 
upon the children was electric, and their interest was so intense as 
it sounded louder and nearer that their voices were stilled, and in the 
* quiet, Santa’s voice was heard admonishing his team to “Whoa, Dasher 
and Dancer,” and all the rest of the historic names. There was more 
jingling and stamping, and finally Santa Claus, the traditional Santa 
Claus with his white beard, his twinkling eyes, his red fur-trimmed 
suit and the bulging pack on his back, came in puffing. This most 
agreeable part is usually played by one of the teachers, or sometimes 
by one of the alumni who is with us to take part in the family fun. 
Last year one of the former teachers, much beloved of the school, was 
chosen. His first inquiry, after a greeting to the children and a rap- 
turous reply from them, was as to the identity of the School, “Is this 
the Francis W. Parker School?” When the children assured him that 
it was, he produced a huge order-book and found the place where 
there were entries of toys. “I have here an order for twenty sleds 
Are they ready?” A small spokesman came forward, “They are all 
ready and are like this one, and we want them to go to the Orphans’ 
Home.” The other items were checked in the same manner, and then 
Santa Claus, who had to hurry off to another school, suddenly remem- 
bered that he had some stockings in his pack for these children, and 
gave them out by grades as labeled. One child from each grade re- 
ceived the stocking assigned for it, holding a little conversation with 
Santa Claus. at the same time, thanking him for the gifts and asking 
again anxiously whether the articles made to order were really satis- 
factory. Being reassured, the children were satisfied, and after Santa 
Claus had said, “Good-bye, a Merry Christmas to all,” the children 
with their guests went back to their own rooms—or their homes—with 
the happy confidence that they had made some one else’s Christmas 
happier, and had done the thing which they had contracted to do. 
This feeling of something well done, undoubtedly adds to their joy in 
the real Christmas service of the next day.

Note—This program is printed very carefully on soft, translucent Japan fibre paper, 
with red lines and initial letters, The effect is beautiful. The soft quality of the paper 
prevents rustling. 
Preparation for the Christmas service includes much that is 
difficult to describe. It is perhaps sufficient to say that the music and 
readings are planned and studied, in so far as it is possible, as an 
expression of the spirit of good will.

For the service, the assembly room is decorated in green and 
silver. There are two large, beautiful fir trees, whose dark foliage 
shows plainly through a network of delicate silver lines. Small elec- 
tric lights shine like silver stars on the branches, and furnish most of 
the illumination for the room. Evergreen and holly soften the lights 
on the side walls and ceiling, and make the background for the chorus. 
The children come in quietly, the girls in white dresses, during a 
quiet improvization on an old carol. A little child begins the service 
by telling the gospel narrative. At the close the guests rise with the 
children to sing the final hymn. 
The Nativity—By Douglas Hyde 
Explanations and details of the presentation of the Christmas 
play must be deferred until they can be supplied by the teacher of 
dramatic work, but the present Year Boox would be incomplete in 
an essential element without some brief comment at least upon the 
moral qualities of the play, its effect upon the children who act in — 
it, and the audience. 
The spirit of the play is both poetic and genuinely childlike, and 
its form is simple to the point of conventionalization. The spiritual 
aspiration and humility of all the characters are expressed without 
affectation or overemphasis, and all the action is extremely simple and 
quiet. The play is presented with entire reverence and directness by 
the various casts, each child making his best effort to be clear and 
truthful in thought and action. 
There have been various types of audiences. The little children © 
of the School, the upper grades, parents and friends, public-school 
children, the children of the half-orphan asylum, a group of Italians 
from the neighborhood of the Commons, have all come to see it, and 
the effect upon them seems to be very nearly the same. There have 
been a few slight attempts to applaud at the end of the play, but they 
were quickly subdued by the audience as a whole. The play evidently 
leaves an impression, to say the least, of solemnity, spiritual sincerity 
and lovelines. . 
The Christmas Music 
A description of Christmas would be inadequate without some 
word of appreciation of the Christmas music. This, perhaps, can be 
given best by quoting from a letter written by a visitor to the School, 
Christmas, 1912.
-P-A-G-E-144
Yerar Boox 143 
“T came home from: the Christmas service at your school with a heart 
so full of gladness that I must say a word to you. 
“First I was happy because the true idea of the meaning of Christmas 
comes to these children, not so much by what they say as by what they do 
about it. This, it seems to me, runs like a living stream—beginning with the 
preparatory work of the ‘Santa Claus Shop’—growing ever clearer, through 
the beautiful ‘Nativity Play,’ and culminating in the Christmas music. I 
cannot believe that it is possible for children to sing these songs as I heard 
them today without feeling that there is left with them a deep, holy, happy 
impression which will be recalled whenever this music is heard. 
“I realize that in the daily life of this school, music stands for a reality 
in a child’s life; it is not simply an art to be cultivated, it is a thing of the 
heart and life that cannot be so well expressed in any other form. The 
Reinecke Christmas Canon was especially beautiful in its simple rendering 
and beautiful harmony. 
“It was good, too, to have the privilege of joining with you all in the 
grand old ‘Adeste Fideles” I am glad the great works of the past have a 
place here, and that parents and children, teachers and friends, may share 
the good things for which the School stands, not only at Christmas, but at 
all times. Auice H, Puram.”

    PREPARATION FOR CHRISTMAS IN THE FIRST GRADE 
The favorite of the second grade was the Rossetti carol, the third 
preferred the poem by Phillips Brooks. They were kept as a surprise 
for Miss Cooke, and as a contribution to the service in case they were 
needed. The songs also were prepared in an atmosphere which was 
free from self-consciousness and the anticipation of display. They 
were learned to sing to other children and to their parents when op- 
portunity should come, and when it came were given in a spirit of 
self-forgetfulness and serious effort. 
The Story of the Nativity 
Preparation for Christmas in the First Grade 
Immediately after Thanksgiving, the first-grade children began 
to prepare for Christmas. In their own room they made and filled 
with cotton, a mattress and pillows for a large doll’s bed, which had 
been mended in the shop. For this bed they hemmed the sheets and 
pillow slips and embroidered a blanket. They trimmed a Christmas 
tree with cornucopias which they had made and decorated; they 
dipped candles, fastened them upon a tree and lighted them to see
-P-A-G-E-146

if their work was good. After all was finished the Christmas tree was 
given to the Children’s Memorial Hospital and the doll’s bed was sent 
to a kindergarten. 
The Christmas spirit is diffused through all the children’s work. 
Christmas boxes and baskets are decorated ; Christmas songs are sung ; 
Christmas legends are told and the story of the Christ-child is learned. 
Story of the Christ-Child—St. Luke, Ch, IT, 7-21 
The story of the Nativity is taught because it is a beautiful piece 
of literature, which describes a series of incidents in language so clear 
and simple that a little child can comprehend them, and the events 
are portrayed so graphically that he sees them as he would a painted 
picture. Although there are many legends and stories connected with 
Christmas, the version given by St. Luke interprets the Christmas 
story more beautifully than any other. It is our belief that it is the 
highest expression of the spirit of the season, and tends to develop in 
the child an ethical and spiritual sense. 
A description of the country around Bethlehem is given, in order 
that the children may have a better understanding of the story, and as 
Eastern cities are so different from our own, a picture of Jerusalem 
is shown, with its flat-roofed houses and its thick walls surrounding 
the city. In the picture caravans are seen going to and from the city. 
It is explained to the children that the camels are the only animals 
that can make the long journeys across the desert and go days without 
water, and pass through sand storms; and that asses are only used in 
traveling short distances, from one city to another, or from the hills 
to a city or town. It is suggested that the people perhaps have come 
to pay their taxes, or to bring food, or that they may have come from 
distant countries with silks and spices. 
Now that the children have a picture of the country and some idea 
of the customs of the people, they are ready for the story of the Na- 
tivity. The version used is that found in the second chapter, the 
seventh through the twentieth verse of St. Luke. The word Mary is 
used instead of “she” in the seventh verse. The story is presented 
to the children as a whole, and each group of events is discussed 
separately. Then the story is written on the blackboard, and as they 
go over it picturing the details again and again, the written copy 
assists them in committing it to memory. This is the method used 
in developing the story. 
All the children are able to repeat the story, but not with the
-P-A-G-E-147
146 Francis: W. Parker ScHoon 
same degree of feeling; some are more imaginative and more expres- 
sive than others, but all seem to catch much of its real spirit. The 
children are led to realize that this is the most beautiful story that 
has ever been written; that it is true. And gradually there comes 
a feeling of love and reverence for it, and the thought that it should be 
told in the most beautiful and sacred manner. 
In order to have the children enter more readily into the spirit 
of the story, perfect quiet is brought about, so that all may be led to 
a higher mental plane; and then through the influence of pictures, 
stories and conversation, an atmosphere of sympathetic understand- 
ing, even perhaps of awe, is created. In imagination they travel across 
the sea to the little town of Bethlehem; they go to the inn where the 
Christ-child was born. 
They read: 
And Mary brought forth her first born son, and wrapped him in 
swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for 
them in the inn.” 
The children are told that Mary and Joseph had come here to 
pay their taxes. They had found crowds of people. They had gone 
from one inn to another, but at last they had come to a place where 
cows, asses and sheep were kept; and here they rested and the little 
child was born. It is explained that Mary wrapped her little son in 
many folds of cloth, and that even now in some countries, people wind 
folds of cloth around their tiny babies. The children look at a pic- 
ture and they see Joseph standing, looking down at Mary, and the 
little child lying in a manger near her. 
The thought is now directed to: the hillside where the shepherds 
are keeping watch over their flocks. The children learn that the shep- 
herds stay with their flocks night and day, for the sheep might run 
away and get lost, or wolves might come and kill them. It is pleas- 
ant out there on the hillside, for the shepherds sing songs, tell stories, 
and watch the moon and the wonderful stars. Sometimes a star 
flashes across the dark blue sky, and then again one seems to drop 
down to the ground. The night in the story was different from other 
nights; it was a wonderful night, for the story says: 
“And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, 
keeping watch over their flocks by night. 
“And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the 
Lord shone round about them; and they were sore afraid.”
-P-A-G-E-148
Yuar Boox 147 
The angel spoke gently and the shepherds forgot to be afraid 
and listened, for it says: 
“And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good 
tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this 
day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.” 
By this the angel meant: “Do not be afraid, for I am bringing 
good news to every one in the world, a child has been born who will 
teach all people how to be kind, gentle, helpful, and truthful.” In 
explaining the following verse where the angel says: 
“And this shall be a sign unto you; ye shall find the babe wrapped in 
swaddling clothes, lying in a manger,” 
the children were told that the thought of the angel was, that 
if the shepherds found the babe lying in a manger, they might be 
certain that this was truly the Christ-child. 
The next verse tells of the shepherds seeing not only one but 
many angels, singing and praising God. 
“And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host 
praising God, and saying, ‘Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, 
good will toward men.’ ” 
In the last verse the angels meant that there should be no more 
war upon the earth, and that all men should become friends. Then 
the picture changes, and in imagination the children see the shepherds 
alone with their flocks. The wondrous light has faded from the sky 
and the angels have gone. 
“And it came to pass, as the angels were. gone away from them into 
heaven, the shepherds said one to another, ‘Let us now go even unto 
Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath 
made known unto us.’ 
“And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe 
lying in a manger. 
“And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which 
was told them concerning this child. 
. “And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told 
them by the shepherds,” 
A picture is shown to the children of the shepherds kneeling be- 
fore the child, and another picture showing the babe in the manger 
near the mother. They see Joseph looking at Mary and the child, 
while the shepherds stand with bowed heads. It is made plain that 
after the shepherds had seen the Christ-child they felt certain that 
everything the angels had said was true, and that they went away 
and told everyone what they had heard and seen. They told of their 
visit to Mary and Joseph, and of finding the little Christ-child lying
-P-A-G-E-149
148 Franois W. Parker ScHOoL 
in the manger. The shepherds’ story was so wonderful that the peo- 
ple did not know what to think or say: 
“But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.” 
This means that Mary thought over and over again of the visit 
of the shepherds; of the story they told her, and of the wonderful 
child which God had given her. : 
The last verse of this story gives a picture of the shepherds going 
back to their flocks: 
“And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the 
things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.” 
And we see them going up the hillside, singing songs of praise 
and thanking God, because they had heard the angels and had seen 
the Christ-child. 
The children now leave the shepherds with their flocks and see 
in imagination three kings riding upon camels. They too, have come 
to see the Christ-child. They had traveled many miles to see him; 
they had crossed deserts and plains; they had passed through cities 
and towns and had found the little child lying in a manger—in a 
‘stable. These kings had come because it had been said many, many 
years before that a king would be born, and they had been watching 
for a sign. At last they had seen a wonderful star in the east and 
had followed it. It led them to Bethlehem and stood over the place 
where the little child lay. The kings brought precious gifts to this 
wonderful child. They worshiped him and went away rejoicing.

THANKSGIVING EXERCISES 
Instinctively we are not unlike all those peoples who have ex- 
pressed themselves with devotion in songs of thanksgiving at the 
harvest time, or who have praised the Giver in some impressive relig- 
ious ceremonial. But in experience we who dwell in cities differ 
widely from the true children of the soil. We who do not plant the 
seed and care for the growing corn and watch the clouds and wind 
and rain, we who do not gather in the harvest, cannot appreciate 
with the same emotion what the harvest means. However, we cannot 
see the summer, with its rich gifts, draw to a close without some feel- 
ing of gratitude. But we are impelled to higher forms of expression 
of this feeling only as we multiply our experiences with nature. This 
we can do in some measure, even in a city. 
The varied garden activities and the annual exhibition of garden 
products at the “County Fair’* are vital experiences in the lives of 
the children. These activities, together with the morning exercises on 
the world crops of the year and the scientific and economic problems 
involved, foster a genuine appreciation of the Thanksgiving service. 
Sometimes this service takes the form of a ceremonial, with 
processional and music, and occasionally it is a representation of some 
historical form. The programs which follow illustrate more fully 
the variation :

needlework, where dresses, laces, embroidery, and sewing of all kinds show what the 
summer’s leisure time and industry have produced. 
Everybody goes to the flower garden to play a game at testing himself on the names 
of all the flowers; then he plays with all the pets—birds, cats, rabbits, dogs, ponies, 
raccoons, goats, etc., that have come from the homes to spend a day at school to show 
themselves to everybody. Then the young gardeners sell herbs, vegetables, flowers, 
jellies, candies, and needlework, if they wish to, and use the income according to their 
own discretion. A committee of judges is appointed from the faculty and children, to 
generously distribute blue ribbons where they are deserved.

Especially useful as a beautiful literary expression of the con- 
ception which even the younger children have of Thanksgiving is St. 
Francis’s Canticle of the Sun. The simple expression of a seventh- 
grade pupil given below on the significance of Thanksgiving embodies, 
with obvious similarity, the same ideas expressed by St. Francis. The 
children readily adopt, with genuine understanding, this more beau- 
tiful literary form. . 
Phoebe (seventh grade). If I were not educated, I think that the two 
seasons that would influence me most are spring and autumn. I think that 
in some way of my own I would celebrate those two seasons, even if they 
had never been mentioned to me. 
The reason I think the spring would influence me is that at that time 
everything is changing; the weather is changing, it is getting warm; the 
animals are getting new coats; even the birds are changing; the spring 
birds are coming, and the winter ones are going back; the land is changing, 
too; it is becoming green, and no matter where it is, most everyone is 
happy; the crops are coming up. I think that would make me set a day 
apart from other days, to pray that these crops might turn out well. I 
think that the first two that I would pray to would be the sun and the rain. 
I would pray for the sun to shine on the crops and make them ripe, and I 
would pray for the rain to water them, because food is necessary to life. 
Then in the autumn I would feel very thankful, and would set apart another 
day in which to give my thanks for everything. I don’t think I would think 
of Thanksgiving day, but I would be thankful for a great many things. Some 
of them are fire, sun, the moon, the stars, the rain, grass, beautiful birds, 
flowers, and mother and father. In fact, I would feel thankful for every- 
thing good and beautiful.

Three Thanksgiving Days—Greek, Hebrew and American 
FIRST DAY 
Monday, November 27, 19141 
Prologue (givew by a teacher). 
Is not autumn the climax of the year, and is it not the fulfillment which 
the other seasons promise? Of all people, those who till the ground most 
keenly feel this truth. It is the harvest toward which all their efforts have 
been bent; it is the harvest that determines their future. At the garnering 
worry is at end, happiness is assured, and gladness fills the farmer’s heart. 
He looks at the rich yield, and, remembering the small seed that he sowed, 
and the many dangers that threatened the crop, he marvels at the power of 
life, and his soul reaches out in thankfulness to his God, who has nurtured 
and warmed the earth and quickened the seed. So it has been ever since 
man first put his hand to the plow and found the friendly earth reward 
him in fruits. Age after age, at every return of the garnering, men in 
various fashions, according to their race and their time, have put on rich 
raiment and have filled their arms with earth’s bounty and have gone to 
the altars of their gods to give thanks and to share the harvest. In awe 
and in deep solemnity the Hebrews, after the threshing of the wheat, drew 
near to Jehovah in praise. To close the gathering in of the grapes, the 
Greeks, in lightness of heart, frolicked gaily before Dionysos, the “bringer 
of joy,” the “ripener of mellow fruits.” And who shall judge how man can 
best express his love? 
Today, and tomorrow, and the next day, we plan to body forth, in 
three’ different ways, the joy and the love and the thankfulness that man 
feels at the harvest of blessings that the year has borne. We admonish you 
not to look upon what is done on this platform as a play for your amuse- 
ment, but as you behold the Thanksgiving of the Grecks today, of the 
Hebrews tomorrow, and of the Americans the day after, join with them 
in their rejoicing and send up your hearts to the heights.

DIONYSIAC FESTIVAL 
(Given by Fifth Grade) 
(Enter three people bearing gifis.) 
First. My vines hung so full that the very trees drooped. 
Second. Our cellars will not hold the wine. 
Third. Nay, they are overflowing, and the very ground is soaked with 
Dionysos’ bounty. . 
First. Praise to Dionysos, cry I! 
Second. This will be a joyful festival. 
Third. Wither come other worshipers. Behold Milo’s great jar! 
(Enter three other people, bearing gifts.) 
First. Ah, Milo! Generous man! 
Milo. Shall I be niggardly with him who gave us all these blessings? 
Fourth. When was there ever a time that Dionysos was not lavish with 
his kindness? 
Fifth. Aye. But for him we should not have tables, couches, jars, the 
banquet, the dance, and all the pleasant fruits. We have Dionysos to thank 
for all these. 
Second. Pile up your gifts; he deserves them all! 
Third. Ueap high his altar! 
(Enter four other people, bearing gifts. One wears a satyr mask.) 
Sixth. Greetings, neighbors! 
Milo. A satyr! A satyr! 
(All cry out.) 
Fifth. Art a messenger from our ivy-treasured Dionysos, O goat- 
hoofed? 
Fourth. It is Demipho! ° 
Seventh (taking off his mask). I snatched it from the vines as I passed. 
(Placing mask ow altar), To thee, uproarious Dionysos, do I dedicate it. 
Eighth. Oh, the rocks and the caves of Nysa! 
Ninth, And the dancing nymphs! 
Sixth, And the romping satyrs! 
Fourth, Oh, the laughter in the high woods! If 1 could have lived in 
that joyous time, when Dionysos led the dance on the windy mountain tops! 
Eighth. But. the adventure of the pirates! That was the great marvel. 
Tenth. Give ear to the story: 
Concerning Dionysos, the son of the renowned Semele, shall I sing; 
how once he appeared upon the shore of the sea unharvested, on a jutting 
headland, in form like a man in the bloom of youth, with his beautiful dark 
hair waving about him, and on his strong shoulders a purple robe. Anon 
came in sight certain men that were pirates, in a well-wrought ship (sailing 
swiftly on the dark-seas. Ill Fate was their leader, for they, beholding him, 
nodded to each other, and swiftly leaped forth and hastily seized him, and 
set him aboard their ship, and they minded to bind him with grievous bonds. 
But him fetters held not, and the withes fell from his hands and feet. There
-P-A-G-E-156
Year Book / 155 
sat he smiling with his dark eyes, but the steersman saw it and spake aloud 
to his companions: 
“Fools, what god have ye taken and bound? Surely this is Zeus, or 
Apollo of the Silver Bow, or Poseidon; for he is nowise like mortal man, 
but like the gods who have mansions in Olympos. Nay, come fet us instantly 
release him upon the dark mainland, nor lay ye your hands upon him, lest, 
being wroth, he rouse against us masterful winds and rushing storms.” 
So spake he, but their captain rebuked him with a hateful word: “Fool, 
look thou to the wind, and haul up the sail, and grip to all the gear, but this 
fellow will be for men to meddle with, Methinks at last he will tell us who 
his friends are, and concerning his wealth, and his brethren, for the god has 
delivered him into our hands.” 
So he spake, and let raise the mast and hoist the mainsail, and the wind 
filled the sail, and they made taut the ropes all round. But anon strange 
matters appeared unto them: first there flowed through all the swift black 
ship a sweet and fragrant wine, and the ambrosial fragrance arose, and fear 
fell upon all the mariners that beheld it. And straightaway a vine stretched 
hither and thither along the sail, hanging with many a cluster, and dark ivy 
twined around the mast, blossoming with flowers, and gracious fruits and 
garlands grew on all the thole-pins. Meanwhile, within the ship, the god 
changed to the shape of a lion at the bow; and loudly he roared, and in 
midship he made a shaggy bear; there stood it raging, and on the deck glared 
the lion terribly. Then the men fled in terror to the stern, and there stood 
in fear around the honest pilot. But suddenly sprang forth the lion and 
seized the captain, and the men all at once leaped overboard into the strong 
sea, shunning dread doom, and there were changed into dolphins. But the 
god took pity upon the steersman, and kept him and gave him all good 
fortune, and spake, saying: “Be of good courage, sir, Dear art thou to me, 
and I am Dionysos of the noisy rites.” . 
Hail thou child of beautiful Semele! 
All (at the end of the hymn). Evoe! Evoe! 
(Priest enters, followed by an assistant.) 
Priest. Encircle the altar, ye who have shared Dionysos’ bounty. 
All (as they run to the altar). Dionysos! Dionysos! 
Ninth. The prince of joy! 
Seventh. Lover of the dance! 
Sixth, Ripener of mellow fruits! 
Priest. Lift the hymn. 
Baccuic Sone. 
Where art thou, god of the clustered vine? 
In high Olympos, quaffing the wine 
From golden bowl, while Apolio sings, 
And the muses dance, and the rich hall flings 
A glist’ning light? 
Refrain, 
And now your heavy cymbals ring, 
And still your “Evoe! Evoe!” sing!
-P-A-G-E-157
156 Franots W. Parker ScHoor 
Or dost thou wander the mountain-sides, 
Calling the fawn that in forest hides 
And leaping panther and timid ass 
To follow thee down and dancing pass 
To thy temple white? 
Refrain. 
Or dost thou walk the vineyard ways 
To plump the grapes and spread the haze 
Of mellow ripeness on the earth, 
That loving men may feel no dearth 
Of thy rich fruits? 
Refrain. 
Now, hear us, O Bacchus fair! 
Behold our hands and hear our prayer ! 
Rich wine doth soak thy altar-sod 
To be a perfume to the god 
Who gave the grape. 
Refrain. 
Sweet juices drip from the heavy pile 
Of luscious autumn fruits, the while 
The fire leaps up, the smoke ascends, 
And with it all in madness blends 
Our Bacchic Song. 
A Woman. 
Put on thy ivy crown, 
O Thebes, thou sacred town! 
O hallowed house of dark-haired Semele! 
Bloom, blossom, everywhere, 
With flowers and fruitage fair, 
And let your dancing steps supported be 
With branches from the oak 
Or the green ash tree broke; 
Shaking his joyful wand, let each advance, 
And all the land shall gladden with the dance. 
(All dance of.) 
SECOND DAY 
THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES 
This scene was prepared with the assistance of a Chicago Rabbi, 
and of a gentleman—an accomplished Hebrew scholar—who has chil- 
dren in the School. Great care was taken to arrange the exercise so 
that it should conform to ancient Jewish custom, yet should.avoid 
elements which were too sacred to be used in a school festival. The 
children were selected not only because they could sing the unaccom- 
panied chant, and could suitably represent Jewish people, but also
-P-A-G-E-158
YEAR Book 157 
because they would enter sincerely and reverently into the spirit of 
the festival. 
The group consisted of a boy from the second grade, a girl from 
the fifth, a girl and three boys from the High School, and two post- 
graduate boys. - 
In reading the report, it must be kept in mind that the use of 
the bread and wine—a weekly observance in the orthodox Jewish 
household—while it is the origin of the Christian Holy Supper, has 
not, to the Jewish Church, any other symbolism than that of repre- 
senting the fruits of the earth, and is in no sense a sacrament. 
(Stage arranged to represent booth used by Jewish family during week 
of feast. Sides and ceiling of lattice covered with palms. Long table with 
white cloth over red one, set with jug of wine and cup, loaf of bread, and 
small dish of salt. Seats around table for each member of household. Dur- 
ing prologue no one on stage.) 
Prologue. Joy be to you who are gathered here today to celebrate, with 
thankful hearts, the harvest festival! 
And where, think you, was kept the first Thanksgiving day which history 
records for us? . 
Not on the bleak shore of New England, when our Pilgrim forefathers 
gave thanks for prosperity, peace, and safety; not in Old England, or 
France, or Italy, when the youths and maidens made merry over the bringing 
in of the grain and the gathering of the grapes; not even in sunny Hellas, 
when men and women danced and sang praise in Dionysos, who had made 
glad their hearts with wine. 
Hundreds of years before all these—before Rome was founded, or the 
Greeks had conquered Troy—a thousand years before the birth of Christ, 
on the hills of Palestine, the Jewish nation kept its harvest festival, the 
Feast of Tabernacles. 
This feast had to them a double meaning, for in it they not only gave 
thanks for bounty received, but also called to mind the time when, having 
been delivered from a life of slavery in Egypt, they wandered for forty years 
in the wilderness, until they came into the promised land—dwelling during 
these forty years in no settled homes, but in tents, or in rough shelters built 
of boughs. 
Therefore, during the week of the feast, every family in Israel dwelt in 
a booth of branches, which they built in their gardens or on the flat roofs 
of their homes, or in the streets before their doors, for so they were com- 
manded by the Lord in the holy Book of the Law. . 
In building these booths, they were commanded to leave open one side, 
in token of the hospitality which every Israelite extended to all who came 
to his door, even to the stranger within his gates. In weaving the branches 
over the roof, there were always left small openings through which could be 
seen the sun by day and the moon and stars by night, that the people might
-P-A-G-E-159
158 | Francis W. Parker ScHoor 
remember that howsoever dark and overshadowed the situation in which they 
then were, yet if they would look up, they could always find light. 
For every day of the week of the feast there was prescribed a certain 
observance of prayers, chants, and readings from the Book of the Law, which 
took place in the home, the father of the family and the male members of 
the household reciting the various portions of the service. But the first day 
and the last day of the feast were Sabbath days, and in them people did no 
servile work, but betook themselves, with their offerings, to the temple, where 
the priests led them in songs of praise, read to them from the scroll of the 
Law, and offered long and heartful prayers of thankfulness to Jehovah. 
During the many years when the judges and the kings ruled the Jewish 
people, it was the custom for the male members of the family, and sometimes 
also the women and girls, to go up to Jerusalem to keep the three great 
feasts of the year—the Feast of the Passover, which is our Easter time; the 
Feast of Shabuoth, our Pentecost, commemorating the giving of the Ten 
Commandments; and the Feast of Tabernacles, which was the most joyful 
time of the year, so that it was often spoken of as “The Feast.” People 
from distant places visited their relatives or friends in the city of the king, 
and all Jerusalem was filled with rejoicing. For days before the feast, the 
roads leading cityward was traveled by bands of people bearing palm 
branches and offerings of fruit, or leading animals for the sacrifice. As they 
walked they sang chants of praise and thanksgiving, and so beautiful were 
these psalms that to this day no more perfect and fitting expression of 
thanksgiving has ever been written, and their words, translated into every 
tongue, form part of the thanksgiving festivals of people all over the world. 
Since the time when Rome conquered Jerusalem, the Hebrew nation has 
become scattered over the face of the earth.. Its members have been perse- 
cuted by those calling themselves by the name of One who was Himself a 
Jew. They have suffered loss of country, of liberty, of life, yet to this day 
do the Israelitish people follow in the way that was commanded them of 
old; to this day do they observe their national feasts, and on the fifteenth 
day of the seventh month, according to the Hebrew calendar—about six 
weeks earlier than our Thanksgiving day—they celebrate the Feast of Taber- 
nacles. Even those who cannot themselves build a booth of their own go at 
least once a day, for the week of the feast, to the booth of a neighbor, or to 
the one in their synagogue; to join in the celebration. Where the unfavorable 
climate prevents using a booth out-of doors, one is built within the house. 
Not everyone may be able to bring his own thanksgiving emblems, the citron 
and palm branch, but he may use those of another, or the priest may wave 
the lilav and eserick, as the palm and fruit are called, for his people. Even 
the lowliest exercises such hospitality as he can, though he may have but a 
bit of bread to offer his guests; but is not bread the chosen symbol of the 
gifts for which, at this season, rich and poor alike return thanks? 
And now, as we follow the observance, according to the ancient Jewish 
custom, of the season of Thanksgiving, let us keep in mind that we are a 
part of that procession of humanity which, through all the ages, has gone 
up at its appointed season, to its appointed place, to make formal acknowl- 
edgment of the gifts it has received from that Power which is, itself, life 
and joy.

Father. Now let our prayer ascend unto Thee, O Lord, for Thou art 
the sanctifier and savior of Israel. 
On this day of the feast we will take the golden fruit of the goodly 
citron tree, to praise Thee, whose law is more precious than gold. With 
one branch of the lofty palm we praise Thee, who art most righteous and 
most exalted; with two branches of the beautiful waving willow, we praise 
Thee, who causest the uttermost sphere to move; and with three branches of 
myrtle we praise Thee, who didst guide the three patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac 
and Jacob. 
With hands washed in purity, take we the perfect fruit and the 
perfect branches; for how, with impurity upon us, shall we come before 
Thee, who art purity; or how, with offerings imperfect and unlawfully ob- 
tained shall we stand in Thy presence, who wilt consume as with fire that 
which is imperfect and unlawful? 
And as the goodly fruit hath scent and taste, so are there among these 
people those who study the law and observe Thy precepts; and 
as.the palm beareth fruit that hath a sweet taste and no scent, so are 
there among them those that observe Thy precepts but know not the Book of 
the Law; and as the myrtle hath a sweet scent but a bitter taste, so are there 
among them those that meditate upon the law, yet is their palate bitter; and 
as the willow hath neither taste nor scent, so are there those that are per- 
verse and stupid. Yet as the palm that bears fruit covers those that bear 
none, so do those that are perfect shield those that are not, that all may 
stand before Thee, who makest even the wrath of man to praise Thee. 
Blessed art Thou, O Lord.

down, east, west, north and south.)

And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When ye be come 
into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then 
shalt ye bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest unto the priest. 
And he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted for you; on 
the morrow after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it. 
* a * 
And ye shall eat neither bread nor parched corn, nor green ears, until 
the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God; it shall 
be a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 
* * * 
And when ye reap the harvest of your land thou shalt not make clean 
riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, nor shalt thou gather 
any gleaning of thy harvest; thou shalt leave them unto the poor and the 
stranger: I am the Lord your God. 
* * * 
And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying: 
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: The fifteenth day of this 
seventh month shall be the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days unto the 
Lord. On the first day shall be an holy convocation: Ye shall do no servile 
work therein. Seven days shall ye offer an offering, made by fire unto the 
Lord. On the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall 
offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord; it is a solemn assembly; and ye 
shall do no servile work therein.

And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees,

branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the 
brook ;.and ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days. 
And ye shall keep it a feast unto the Lord for seven days in the year. 
It shall be a statute forever in your generations; ye shall celebrate it in the 
seventh month. 
Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shail 
dwell in booths. 
That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to 
dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I am the 
Lord your God. (From Leviticus 23.)

hast granted us life, sustained us, and permitted us to celebrate this joyous 
festival. ,

blessings which this Feast of Succoth brings to us. May God’s providence,

THIRD DAY 
Wednesday, November 29, 1911 
The children came into the assembly room and stood dur- 
ing the processional. The girls of the upper grades led, singing “Come, 
Ye Thankful People, Come,” followed by the seventh- and eighth-grade 
boys bearing sheaves of grain, baskets of fruit, or sprays of autumn 
leaves and flowers. They were followed by the tenors and basses. The 
seventh- and eighth-grade boys went up the steps to the stage, which 
had as a background dull green curtains, and was furnished with a 
large plain chair at one side and a bench in the center. As the boys 
took their places on each side of the stage, Marguerite, one of the 
graduates, came in and stood by the chair. The basses and tenors, 
who were in groups on each side of the steps, sang an opening sen- 
tence, “The eyes of all wait upon Thee, that Thou mayst give them 
their meat in due season. Thou openest Thy hand and fillest all 
things living with plenteousness.” The boy who carried grain then 
delivered the following speech as he placed his grain against the bench: 
Alfred (seventh grade). Behold the wealth of the field! How the 
valleys have put forth their strength and fruited. The sons of men ask for 
bread, and the ground is clothed with richness. The slender stalks are bent, 
and the heads hang down with fatness. Our bins are running over. These 
kernels shall make the strength of man’s body and the fortitude of his heart. 
Shall not our souls be lifted up with joy? Shall not our mouths sing? And 
let not one lack nourishment when the earth is full, Then bring the sheaves 
in token of our joy, and bestow comforting grain in proof of brotherhood. 
Then came a child with fruit, followed by children carrying 
leaves and flowers, making a carefully arranged mass of color and 
form. Each child in turn gave his offering. 
Russell (seventh grade). Bring the fruit of the trees and the wealth of 
the vine! The earth has brought forth beauty, and the garden of the world 
has grown food. We that dwell in plenty, we that sit in full storehouse, 
how blessings are heaped upon us! Set them forth, that we may see how 
abundant is our good fortune! Heap up the fruits and let him that is 
anhungered and has not, come hither and feast with us. And let the whole 
earth sing “hallelujah”! 
Ogden (seventh grade.) There grow up from the earth fruit and grain 
for the support of man’s body, but what shall feed his soul? Look forth 
upon the hills and the meadows, how the earth is caparisoned in beauty! 
The great forests flame, and every clod has blossomed. The eyes behold, 
and the shades of sorrow and the burden of dullness are lifted! Bring 
hither, then, leaves and flowers. Deck the barren places. Let the dark city 
and the bleak houses bloom! And sing for joy that our minds are opén to 
beauty, and sing that there is so fair a world to feast upon.
-P-A-G-E-164
YuaR Boox 163 
The speech of Marguerite then summed up the whole: 
“What shall I bring in gladness? Not grains that nourish man, nor fruits 
that solace him, nor flowers that cheer him. But does the earth labor and 
bring forth harvest, and do her works perish utterly? Does man consume 
them and go down to the grave barren? Rather do earth’s seeds take root 
in men’s hearts and there come to fruition in joy and gentleness and love. 
And are not these to be prized above all other things? Of these, then, I 
bring the memory to crown our heaped-up blessings. And my heart sings in 
joy for my brother man, with feet that run upon errands of mercy, with 
hands that serve in loving charity, with souls that suffer long and are kind, 
with minds that soar up into the high places of the universe.” 
This was followed by the “Benedicte,” “Oh, all ye works of the 
Lord, bless ye the Lord; praise Him and magnify Him forever,” sung 
antiphonally by the older boys. The children then read the following 
litany* responsively, after which the boys led the recessional, “ 
Plow the Fields.” 
LITANY OF THANKFULNESS 
For days of health, 
For nights of quiet sleep, 
For seasons of bounty and beauty, 
For all earth’s contributions to our need, 
Good Lord, we thank Thee. 
For our country’s shelter, 
For our homes, 
For the joy of faces and the joy of hearts that love, 
Good Lord, we thank Thee. 
For our power of growth, . 
For longings to be better and do more, 
For ideals that ever rise above our real, 
Good Lord, we thank Thee. 
For opportunities well used, 
Good Lord, we thank Thee. 
For our temptations and for any victory over sins that close beset us, 
For the gladness that abides with loyalty and the peace of the return, 
Good Lord, we humbly thank Thee. 
For the blessedness of service, 
For the power to fit ourselves to others’ needs. 
Good Lord, we thank Thee. 
For our necessities of work, . 
For burdens, pains, and disappointments, means of growth, 
Father, we thank Thee. 
For all that brings us nearer to each other, nearer to ourselves, nearer to 
Thee, 
For life, . 
We thank Thee, O our Father.

PATRIOTIC EXERCISES 
  
The patriotic exercises are too important and too valuable to be 
left out of a year book, the purpose of which is to suggest the best 
uses of the morning-exercise period. One typical exercise of this kind 
-~that of Memorial Day—is given under “School Unity and School 
Policies,” but on account of lack of space the yearly observances by 
the School of the birthdays of Washington and Lincoln are not illus- 
trated by verbatim reports. 
When planning our Washington and Lincoln celebrations, we 
have tried to keep in thought at least these two distinct aims: first, to 
give the children a more intimate acquaintance with the lives of 
these great leaders and a greater appreciation of the price they paid 
in their heroic struggles to forward the ideas in which they so firmly 
believed; second, to emphasize the inherited duty to the community- 
welfare which their illustrious example and sacrifice demand of us. 
A brief mention of some of the Washington and Lincoln exercises 
may prove helpful and suggestive. 
Washington’s and Lincoln’s own writings furnish us, fortunately, 
with real literary material for our exercises, and for supplementary 
prose and poetry we use only those selections which belong to the first 
rank, for we believe that there is time in school to deal only with 
literature of recognized superiority. 
For our Washington and Lincoln celebrations we have occa- 
sionally had excellent speakers come and address the School. For our 
Lincoln exercises we have on several occasions had some one who actu- 
ally knew the great Emancipator talk to us, and always on Lincoln’s 
birthday we endeavor to have the Gettysburg speech.

EXERCISES BY OUTSIDE SPEAKERS 
  
There have been some morning exercises in which the children 
have taken no active part. Some have been given by patrons of the 
school, members of the faculty, and alumni; and others have been 
presented by persons not connected with the School. Among the latter 
there have been experts and specialists in the arts, sciences, govern- 
ment, and reform. 
Many of these exercises have been’ connected with grade activities. 
The twelfth grade at one time gave a series of exercises on the gen- 
eral subject of courtesy, in support of a courtesy code drawn up by 
a joint committee of pupils and teachers; and as a part of this series, 
the managing director of the Playgrounds’ Association of Chicago, 
was invited to talk to the School on how the play activities of these 
centers develop character and citizenship. 
The study of Chicago’s problem of sanitation, by the eighth 
grade, led to a talk by the president of the Sanitary District. The 
interest aroused by morning exercises on astronomy given by the sixth 
grade brought about a series of talks by Professor Forest Ray Moul- 
ton, of the University of Chicago: 
Of similar character, though not direct outcomes of the grade 
activities, are such exercises as those on Greece, Eskimos, and pre- 
historic animals by scientists and travelers; a talk on the Corn Prod- 
ucts Industry, by a patron of the School; a series of experiments with 
electricity by an alumnus; and an exercise on the History of Mathe- 
matics by a member of the faculty. 
Through many of these exercises, the School has been put in 
touch with national and civic crises and events. Some years ago, the 
apparently imminent danger of legislation permitting the destruction 
of Niagara Falls prompted a member of the faculty to explain the 
_situation at a morning exercise. An immediate reaction was obtained 
which resulted in the School’s joining the American Civic Association, 
and in the writing of letters to congressmen by the children, and, at 
their insistence, by their parents. A problem of our city was brought 
to the attention of the school at a critical time by an exércise on the 
question of Garbage Disposal, when the city was planning to change 
169

its methods of doing this work. The subject was discussed by Miss 
Mary E. McDowell, of the University of Chicago Settlement, who 
presented the results of her studies in cities of this and other countries. 
The sympathy of our pupils for less fortunate people has been 
aroused and has borne fruit through exercises at which persons en- 
gaged in philanthropic work have spoken to the school. Memorable 
among these were the exercises devoted to the Big Brother and Sister 
League of Chicago. Mr. Henry W. Thurston told of the methods and 
plans of this association, and about, a year later another speaker em- 
phasized its work for girls. Immediately after the first address, groups 
of the fourth grade, by making and selling candy to the children of the 
School, earned enough money to purchase a membership in the 
league. Volunteer groups were formed in the upper grades for a like 
purpose. 
On several occasions the School and its pupils have served the 
cause of education elsewhere, when aroused by such exercises as those 
describing the Hindman School in Kentucky, and the work of the 
American Indian League. At these times there was a sale of articles 
made by these people. 
_ As typical of another group of exercises we might mention the 
following: reports of a vacation’s experience in Yellowstone Park; 
an automobile tour through historic places in the eastern part of our 
country; a talk by Mr. Enos Mills on the Wild Life of the Rockies, 
and a similar account by Mr. Cy de Vry, Superintendent of the 
Zodlogical Gardens in Lincoln Park.
-P-A-G-E-172
GROUP EXERCISES 
  
Definite efforts have been made to bring the morning exercises 
into touch with the children’s natural interests outside the school. 
The different grades have been canvassed, and the pupils asked if 
there were subjects about which they would like to have ‘exercises 
given. Airships, submarine boats, vacation experiences, Indians, and 
electricity were among the topics which were requested. On one 
occasion, a group of high-school boys on their own initiative, took up 
the subject of airships, planned an exercise, executed drawings, and 
made an interesting presentation. 
The children’s interests in collections have been recognized, and 
profitable exercises have resulted. On a chosen morning, every child 
who wished to exhibit a collection of stamps, coins, stones, pictures, or 
curios, brought it to the School and set it up in some class room. 
There were different rooms for different kinds of collections. People 
who wished to see the exhibits of coins went to the coin room; those 
who wished to see stamps went to the stamp room. The plan had the 
added advantage of breaking up grade lines and bringing children of 
different ages into small social groups. 
At other times we have had the children divided, according to 
their strongest interests, into groups for games, music, charades, and 
story-telling; at other times they have chosen between hearing a talk 
upon some science subject and listening to reading of some good story. 
The chairmen of these groups have sometimes been children, some- 
times teachers, 
As the study of French and German begins in the first grade, 
another form of divided exercise has been to have all the pupils of 
the School who understand French meet in one place for French 
games, songs, and dramatizations, while the German groups met in 
another place for a similar exercise in German. 
On one day a week the school divides at morning exercise period 
into two groups, so that the primary and upper grades may have 
separate music rehearsals for the morning-exercise singing. 
At one time a question box was placed in the hall, and children 
placed in it requests for exercises, or questions which they would 
like to have answered in morning exercises. The plan failed because 
no one undertook the complicated direction which was necessary.

STORY TELLING EXERCISES 
  
They seemed a little hazy in the Ivanhoe class about Shadrach 
and his famous brethren of the fiery furnace. “What Bible stories 
do you know?” brought hesitating replies. Charles had seen some 
moving pictures of Samson the week before. “There’s something,” 
mused Mary, “about David in the lions’ den.” “I can’t remember 
it very well,” drawled Edna contemplatively, “but I have a Child’s 
Bible, and I know there’s a story about seven good queens and seven 
wicked queens, and the seven wicked queens blew out all the lights, 
and the seven good queens couldn’t see their way home.” Evidently 
we had not kept our lamps trimmed and burning. These children 
had missed part of their birthright.* 
The French have a useful saying, to the effect that if every man 
were doing what he is fitted to do, the cows would be well tended. 
Not all children are fitted, in this day of universal book education, to 
revel in what Stevenson calls “purple passages,” or to esteem “Lyci- 
das” the most beautiful poem in literature; but no child is unfitted 
to love a good stirring story. Let him be artistic to his finger tips; 
or let him be stolid as inheritance and environment can make him, 
still a few deathless tales are his heritage. Who shall dare substitute 
a mess of pottage and condemn him to be forever an Edomite, a 
reader of best sellers and magazine fiction ? 
Good parents see to it that their children know these tales. Good 
teachers see to it that other people’s children know some of them. 
Sometimes, in the Francis W. Parker School, a class tells one in the 
morning exercise; a group of orientals, robed in gay, rich garments, 
listens breathless to one of Sinbad’s stirring adventures; and their 
eager interest at the crisis only mirrors the interest of the rest of the 
audience—in our seats in the hall; or the much-enduring Odysseus 
tells his sad tale to King Alcinous and his court; or a Virgil class 
represents a Punic feast, at which Aeneas pours forth. his eloquent 
story to Queen Dido. 
  
*It is a sad fact that the children quoted in the first paragraph of this article are 
not more ignorant of Bible literature than our average eighth-grade boy or girl. We 
wonder if our experience is uncommon—if other schools find that Bible ‘stories are told 
in the homes, As most of our children have good homes and many attend Sunday school, it is difficult to account for the ignorance which prevails in this form of the 
world’s great literature.

Sometimes a grade makes illustrations for a story. We have tried 
three ways of showing these pictures to the School—by blackboard 
drawings, by pen-and-ink sketches shown in the reflectoscope, and 
by drawings on ground glass for the stereopticon. In every case, 
each pupil selected some part of the story which he wished to illus- 
trate. After making the first rough sketches, they found that they 
needed to have more practice in drawing people, so they spent some 
time sketching one another in different positions, studying carefully 
the position they expected to use for the morning exercises. Black- 
board drawings are in some respects the most satisfactory for this 
purpose. These drawings may be used by natural light. The children 
use simple lines and draw very freely. Sometimes, after much prac- 
tice, they draw while the school looks on. Every pupil in the eighth 
grade made a blackboard drawing for “Pilgrim’s Progress.” Then 
they told, in Bunyan’s dramatic words, the wondrous adventures of 
Christian on his way to the Celestial City. For “Robinson Crusoe” 
they tried sketching on ground glass, with pen and India ink. This 
process proved difficult and was not very satisfactory. Other members 
of the school have had experience since then, and we have found that 
sketching on ground glass with a soft pencil is more effective. These 
sketches are used in the stereopticon. The story of Gulliver in Lilli- 
put has been told with the aid of the reflectoscope. The drawings 
were made large at first, as it seemed much easier, and finally they 
were reduced to the required size, finished with pen and ink, and 
neatly mounted. At the close of the story one of the boys pointed 
out the political significance of the satire. The accompanying illus- 
trations show the character of the children’s drawing.

POETRY EXERCISES 
  
_ Poetry is an ally of the music in the lightening and brightening 
of the morning exercise. It plays its part in several ways. One role 
is the introductory reading. The teacher in charge of the exercise - 
will choose an appropriate piece of verse to follow the opening song. 
Happy is he, indeed, if he can find one that will add a touch of fancy 
to the topic of the morning —Miss Mulock’s “Green Things Growing,” 
for an exercise about the school garden; “The Sandpiper,” when 
“Birds” is the subject. Most often, however, he must take something 
on an unrelated theme, chosen for its general appeal, its enduring 
beauty, its inspiring message—Stevenson’s “Celestial Surgeon,” 
Wordsworth’s sonnet beginning “The world is too much with us.” 
Repetition here is a virtue, for by rehearing well-selected pieces. of 
verse, the school gradually comes into possession of part of its poetical 
heritage. A seventh grade once printed a little book of morning- 
exercise readings which had proved to be favorites with children or 
teachers. 
The present class has printed a revised edition. The table of

During the year every grade is studying poetry in the class room 
—the first, Mother Goose, perhaps; and the twelfth, Milton. This 
study, like history and geography and all others, finds its forum in 
the morning exercises. After a class has become acquainted with sev- 
eral poems that they like, they generally want to present them to. the 
school, for verse is song and must be vocalized to be completed, and 
people who are trained into social feeling must share what they find 
good. Perhaps the program is quite heterogeneous, with each child 
giving his favorite—“Charge of the Light Brigade,” “The Daffodils,” 
“A Sea Song,” “Ariel’s Song,’ “The Destruction of Sennecherib.” 
Or a class in the seventh grade has been reading Scotch ballads. On 
one morning, the children show pictures of Scotch costumes, Scotch 
peels, and Scotch scenery, and describe the border life and border 
feuds of three centuries ago. Before this background, on the follow- 
ing morning, they read “Kinmont Willie,” “Chevy Chase,” “The 
Douglas Tragedy,” and sing “Lord Randal” to a tune of their own 
making. Or the fifth grade, hearing Burns’ “To a Mouse,” becomes 
interested in the Scotch dialect and asks for more. After a month, 
the study eventuates in their reading before the school, “To.a Mouse,” 
“To a Mountain Daisy,” “Up in the Morning Early,” “I Love My 
Jean,” “A Rosebud by My Early Walk,’ “The Highland Lassie,” 
“Bannocks of Barley,” “Bannockburn,” “Here’s a Health to Them 
That’s Awa,” “Auld Lang Syne.” Or a teacher of the sixth grade 
has called upon the poets to aid her in lifting into a clearer air the 
childish hunger for wandering, for adventurous travel, that she finds 
among her boys. The children, finding their own dumb emotions 
expressed, throw themselves with ardor into the rendering of another’s 
verse. There results a morning exercise in which pupils of the grade 
read Gerald Gould’s “Wander Thirst,” “The Buccaneer,” Kipling’s 
“Explorer,” Bjérnsen’s “Over the Mountain High.” As a part of the 
same program the boys of the High School sing Schubert’s “Wander-
-P-A-G-E-180
Yzuar Boox 179 
ing” and a buccaneering song to an air composed by one of them- 
selves, and a mother of one of the pupils sings Eleanor Smith’s “Fly- 
ing Kite.” Or in another class there accumulates about “Paul Re- 
vere’s Ride,” as a nucleus, a small collection of famous rides—“Sheri- 
dan’s Ride,” “The Diverting History of John Gilpin,” “The Ride 
from Ghent to Aix.” The class, having enjoyed these stories, give 
{hem again at morning exercise. Perhaps on the other hand, a grade 
becomes interested in an author, his personality as well as his poetry— 
a second grade in Stevenson, a seventh in Scott, a fourth in Blake. 
Such an exercise is reported among “Exercises Showing Types of 
Preparation.” As May-Day approached, a fifth grade once read a 
sheaf of spring poems that they themselves had made. The following 
one was a favorite of the class: 
Spring 
With May-Day comes the lovely spring, 
The ground is ready for the seed, 
The father-bird begins to sing; 
The mother-bird her young does feed. 
The robin redbreast, fat and round, 
Is tapping softly on the ground, 
The foolish worm the signal hears, 
And from the ground he soon appears. 
Leonard M. 
All the exercises thus far described were planned by grades and 
were carefully prepared. At other times we have mornings open to the 
school. There is no preparation by the pupils, except such as in- 
dividuals may make voluntarily after an announcement the day before 
that, “Tomorrow will be a ‘Favorite-Poems Morning.’” The leader, 
however, must prepare very carefully. He ransacks his memory and 
written grade-reports to find what pieces of verse certain classes 
Jearned in certain years. At the morning exercise he gives the first 
line of a poem and says, “Who in the tenth grade can finish that?” 
If he has chosen wisely, and if the Muse of Memory is propitious, a 
pupil rises and finishes the poem, or perhaps goes on for a few. lines, 
and then. must give over and let some one else continue. Next, the 
teacher will perhaps start a nursery-rhyme for the first grade to finish ; 
for it is more diverting if the exercise is a potpourri of young and old, 
of beauty and nonsense. Sometimes the leader will call for any poem 
by a certain author—Scott, Longfellow, Stevenson, Shakespeare. Or
-P-A-G-E-181
180 . Franois W. Parker ScHoon 
he will ask that some one in the audience start a poem. Perhaps 
there will be given a sonnet of Milton, learned the week before in the 
high-school class ; or the “Jabberwocky,” brought from home reading, 
or some old favorite remembered from a primary grade. The idea is 
by any means to make the recalling and reciting of verse a pleasure. 
An exercise in which poetry is given lovingly and joyfully is 
possible only, be it observed, when the teaching of it has been right, 
when children have been free to like or to dislike, when they have not 
been permitted to read aloud unless they have had something to 
express, when they have had an interested audience wanting to get 
something new from their reading, when a rich background of imagery 
and emotion has been built up, when imagination has béen stimulated 
and then has been given liberty to grow after its own manner.

RECITALS 
  
Artist Recitals 
The program of each concert is supplied in advance to the chil- 
dren. In some of the more musical groups, class discussions give to 
the children a few fundamental ideas of form, of themes and how 
they are developed, of different ways of thinking and listening. In 
other groups, preparation may consist chiefly in playing over and over 
melodies which they hear, in telling stories of composers, and in 
presenting the “program” or explanatory notes of music, whenever ~ 
such notes are supplied by the composer. 
Discussions after the recital are principally for the purpose of 
discovering as much as possible about the effect of the music upon the 
children. The only dissatisfied group I ever encountered (there are, of 
course, wearied individuals in many groups), was a sixth grade which 
too conscientiously discharged the onerous duty of sitting in the front 
row, where their least movement would disturb the artists. Hereafter 
musical older children will be seated inthe front. : 
Among the older children, there are those in whom a habit of 
imitating grown people’s discussions on the subject begins to obscure 
and confuse their genuine reactions to music. Distinctions have to 
be drawn for them between opinions about a few details of technique 
which they are competent to discuss and those judgments which re- 
quire experience and independent musical understanding. 
At these recitals, the primary grades are seated near the doors, 
and are obliged to keep perfectly quiet during the music, but are per- 
mitted to escape at will during the applause. Usually about half of 
them remain until the end of the program. 
Artists are chosen largely for their sympathy with the children’s 
needs and experiences. The question of personality is of the utmost 
importance. A yearly appropriation of money for these recitals testi- 
fies to our belief that hearing beautiful music is an important ele- 
ment in education, For two years past subscriptions by the parents 
have materially increased the fund.

This is an ideal program. Variety is one of its obvious character-

to the unmusical they gave, at least, the suggestion of an ideal kind of 
pleasure which others have and afforded some training in listening.

Children’s Recitals 
These occasions provide the kind of audience that is so stimu- 
lating to effort. They satisfy childish curiosity about the attain- 
ments of others, and a craving for a gauge by which to measure their 
own and others’ progress. Giving pleasure is the motive emphasized 
in preparing the programs. 
The instrumental recitals given by the high-school students are 
often managed by the students themselves. The plan suggested to 
them includes the co-operation of the private teachers, and the provi- 
sion of thoroughly good selections. These recitals are recognized by 
the children as fine opportunities of testing one’s courage and ability 
to concentrate. Following are three typical programs:

A CLASSIFIED LIST OF TYPICAL MORNING ‘EXERCISES 
The reports of exercises, fully or partially given in the main 
body of this book, indicate the underlying purposes of those exercises, 
and their connection with the actual class-room. work and other activi- 
ties of the School. . . Co : 
It is the belief of the School that each type of exercise has a 
certain purpose or value, aside from the subject-matter presented. 
It is hoped that the following list of exercises will fulfil a two- 
fold aim; first to show the broad general purposes that govern the 
presentation of various types of exercises by the. pupils of the School ; 
second, to indicate by means of the classification, the.scope of the 
subject-matter presented. , oo : : 
The list here given contains only a comparatively small number 
of the. many exercises that have been given during the twelve years of 
the School’s life, and only the exercises that are typical. In each case 
the grade of elementary-school pupils giving the exercise is indicated 
by a number in parentheses. Thus (4) printed after an exercise 
means that it was given by fourth-grade pupils. Exercises given by 
the high-school pupils are indicated by (H.S.).

MARCHES 
  
Piano marches are used for the assembly and dismissal at most 
morning exercises. In the selection of the music for these marches, 
an attempt is made to use melodies which have an easy and flowing 
rhythm and real musical values. The tempo is such that both the 
large and small people are able to walk in quickly and comfortably. 
The marches written by the best composers are often unsuited to 
practical uses because they demand intelligent listening and are in- 
tended for program performance. When the morning exercise is given 
over to visiting musicians, or in the event of serious religious festi- 
vals, such as Christmas, the march is omitted. The children are 
given some simple training, at class, in walking; they are taught an 
easy carriage of the body to avoid stiff or swaying marching. 
The character of the exercise determines the selection of an 
entrance march, and at the close something in keeping is played when 
possible. The publication of other than the most mediocre marches 
is so limited, that lacking the gift for improvisation, we are driven 
to sources varying from organ composition to grand opera. Good 
patriotic songs and folk music are arranged easily and furnished 
excellent march material. 
The following suggestive list is drawn from our records of the 
past five years: 
Lenore—Raff 
Tannhauser—Wagner 
Flag March—Hollender 
Processional—Ashton 
Five Marches—arr. for the Kindergarten—Eleanor Smith

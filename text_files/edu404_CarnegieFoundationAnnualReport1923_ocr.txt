REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT 
To the Chairman and the Trustees of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement 
of Teaching: 
In accordance with the by-laws, I present herewith the Eighteenth Annual Report 
of the President of the Foundation, for the year ending June 30, 1923. 
In addition to the usual business of the Foundation, the year’s work included the 
further development of the Foundation’s plan of insurance and annuities, through 
the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, which is dealt with fully in later 
pages. The general study of pension systems has continued without abatement. 
For the Division of Educational Enquiry the report includes a statement of pro- 
gress upon a pioneer study of Dental Education, together with material relating to 
the study of Legal Education. 
For the two years ending September 30, 1923, I have served as Acting President 
of the Carnegie Corporation at the request of the trustees of that organization. This 
duty has necessarily occupied a great part of my time as well as the whole time of 
Dr. William S. Learned, who has served most effectively as Assistant to the President. 
In recognition of the amount of time devoted to their service, the trustees of the 
Carnegie Corporation have paid during these two years half of my salary as President 
and the whole of Dr. Learned’s salary. Fortunately, the post of President of the Car- 
negie Corporation has been filled by the election of Dr. Frederick Paul Keppel, who 
will assume the place on October 1, 1923. Under this arrangement, I shall again be 
able to devote my full time to the administrative work of the Carnegie Foundation 
and to the educational studies which it has in progress. 
I venture to call the attention of the trustees to the fact that I am also acting, 
by their direction, as President of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association. 
This agency, devised after long study for the purpose of enabling the teachers of the 
United States and of Canada to obtain, by reasonable payments, protection against 
both the hazard of premature death and of old age, has now been tried by experience 
and has been found to fulfil most successfully the purpose for which it was designed. 
The trustees of the Foundation need to recognize, however, that they will have in 
the future an increasing responsibility with respect to the Association. While it is an 
entirely separate organization, conducted by its own board of trustees and operated 
under the Insurance Laws of the State of New York, it is nevertheless the child 
of the Carnegie Foundation and the outcome of the long experience and study of 
the pension problem carried out by the Foundation. Furthermore, the Foundation 
assumed a certain financial responsibility for the Association with respect to the 
overhead costs whenever they shall exceed the income accumulated from the fund 
provided by the Carnegie Corporation as capital and surplus. This financial respon- 
sibility will be a small one. The increase in overhead costs is comparable to the addi- 
   
-P-A-G-E-10
    4 TRUSTEES AND EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 
tion of a very small number of retiring allowances to the regular list of the Foun- 
dation. There is, however, a larger responsibility involved. The success of the Teach- 
ers Insurance and Annuity Association means that it is rapidly becoming a large 
financial enterprise. The assets of the Association amounted on June 30, 1923, 
to $2,858,467, and they will be increased during the present year by approximately 
$1,000,000. The supervision of this growing agency is itself an increasing responsi- 
bility. Whether the President of the Carnegie Foundation shall continue to act as 
President of the Insurance and Annuity Association will be a matter that some time 
in the future the trustees of the Foundation must consider. 
ENDOWMENT, RESERVES, INCOME, AND EXPENDITURE 
Tue trustees held in trust on June 30 the following securities, given at their face value: 
(a) General Endowment 
United States Steel Corporation 50 year 5 per cent Gold 
Bonds $12,000,000 
Other securities 3,192,000 
Total $15,192,000 
(8) Division of Educational Enquiry 1,292,000 
(c) Reserve Fund Number One! 9,658,000 
(d) Reserve Fund Number Two? '758,000 
(e) Emergency Reserve® ‘ 429,000 
Grand Total $27,329,000 
During the year the trustees received a total income of $1,455,651.44 for general 
purposes —in addition to $53,836.46 from the endowment of the Division of Edu- 
cational Enquiry — $755,651.41 from the general endowment, and $700,000.03 from 
the Carnegie Corporation of New York on account of its appropriations of $200,000 
a year for five years and $600,000 a year for ten years. All of the former appropria- 
tion, of $1,000,000 for Reserve Fund Number Two,” has now been paid in. The de- 
tails of the employment and investment of all of these receipts and of the sale of sundry 
securities and the investment of their proceeds in equally sound but more remuner- 
ative securities with more convenient maturities will be found in the report of the 
treasurer. In general these operations resulted in a cash profit of $65,785.04, an ad- 
vance in yield from 4.76 per cent to 5.76 per cent, and an increase in future aggregate 
income of approximately $1,000,000. 
1“For the liquidation of pension obligations accruing subsequent to January 1, 1928.”

of retiring allowances to old and distinguished teachers or in assisting such colleges.to inaugurate the contrib-

MEETING OF THE TRUSTEES 
Tue seventeenth annual meeting of the trustees was held on November 15, 1922, 
twenty-two members being present. 
In the annual election the following officers were chosen: Chancellor Kirkland, 
chairman; President Murray, vice-chairman; and President Plantz, secretary. Mr. 
Franks and Mr. Vanderlip were elected to succeed themselves as members of the 
executive committee. 
The vacancy on the board created by the resignation of President Thwing was 
filled by the election of President Rush Rhees of the University of Rochester. 
Concerning the status of teachers of engineering, the trustees concurred in the 
recommendation of the executive committee, that Rule 6, restricting retiring allow- 
ances in the professional departments of universities to those whose principal work 
is teaching, should remain unmodified, but that it should be applied by the executive 
committee to teachers of engineering only after consultation in each case with the 
authorities of the institution affected.

    6 TRUSTEES AND EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 
Various changes in the rules for the granting of retiring allowances and pensions, 
as recommended by the executive committee, the president, and the actuaries, were 
adopted unanimously and ordered to be printed for distribution among the associated 
institutions. 
The trustees approved the action of the executive committee in aiding the South- 
ern Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools in a Study of Intercollegiate 
Athletics. 
PROCEEDINGS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 
Tue executive committee met three times during the year, in November, December, 
and May. Full records of these meetings, the ninety-fourth to the ninety-sixth, in- 
clusive, with detailed reports of the financial operations approved by the committee, 
were mailed to the trustees after each meeting. The retiring allowances and pensions 
voted by the committee during the year are given in full on the later pages of this 
report. 
The list of institutions associated with the Foundation was not increased during 
the year. 
In considering the administration of the present rules the committee determined 
again that the rules in force at any time must be administered strictly. Should they 
in any way appear ill-adapted to the interests of the whole body of teachers the com- 
mittee will consider and recommend possible improvements. It would be, however, a 
source of general dissatisfaction to administer existing rules with other than the most 
minute fidelity to their letter and spirit. 
The committee learned of the gratifying reception of Bulletin Number Sixteen — 
Higher Education in the Maritime Provinces of Canada—and was informed, from 
time to time, of the progress of a study of Dental Education, and of further studies in 
Legal Education. Following a survey by the secretary of the Foundation of the opera- 
tions of the College Entrance Examination Board, the executive committee author- 
ized the preparation of a bibliography and synopsis of the literature relating to 
written examinations. 
The committee regretted that, because of studies already under way, it could not 
recommend early action upon requests for studies of medical sects, intercollegiate 
athletics, the teaching of journalism, and pharmacy.

THE ACTIVITIES OF THE FOUNDATION 
Tur present reportis the eighteenth annual report issued by the Carnegie Foundation. 
A glance at these eighteen years of institutional activity makes clear that the 
work of the Foundation has tended to develop along certain lines fixed by experience 
much in the fashion that all such institutions tend to develop. 
At its inception, the Carnegie Foundation concerned itself only with the distri- 
bution of the income of an endowment in accordance with the instructions and de- 
sires of the founder. From the beginning, however, it was clear that it was impossible 
to separate this obligation from certain educational considerations and relations. 
The means employed to deal with this wider conception of its opportunity tended 
in themselves to modify the processes and purposes of the Foundation. 
The process of development which has taken place in these eighteen years has led 
the trustees of the Foundation to various activities, of which the following are the 
principal lines: 
The question of retiring allowances for college teachers has remained the first and 
primary problem with which the Foundation has concerned itself. There has been 
worked out, under expert advice, an agency for dealing with this problem upon sound 
and enduring principles. That agency —the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Asso- 
ciation of America—has already passed its fourth year, has established itself as a 
practical working organization, and is perhaps the greatest contribution that has 
been made toward the protection of the teacher upon conditions that secure life, 
safety, and independence. In the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, the 
Foundation has presented a scientific and successful solution of the problem which the 
founder set before the trustees. 
Along with the development of this new agency, the trustees have likewise con- 
tinued the payments of pensions to those who had expectations under the old sys- 
tem of retiring allowances. For this purpose the trustees will expend, during the 
next generation, many millions of dollars whose total will furnish a generous pension 
to all such teachers who have expectations. In order that this stream shall not be 
exhausted by unexpected drains, it is necessary that the trustees examine the actual 
possibilities of the fund from year to year and make such modifications as experience 
may show to be necessary in the distribution of their reserves in the interest of the 
whole body of teachers. The trustees will find in the report of the auditor a very 
satisfactory statement touching the handling of the securities in Reserve Fund Num- 
ber One by the finance committee. This reserve is made up mainly of securities that 
mature within the next twenty-five years, since the reserve is to be expended, prin- 
cipal and interest, in the payment of pensions. The reserve was increased during the 
year by approximately $800,000, of which $60,000 arose out of profits in the sale of 
securities. 
Another contribution which the Foundation has made to the whole problem of
-P-A-G-E-30
    20 BUSINESS OF THE YEAR 
pensions has been the description year by year in its reports of all pension systems 
in all parts of the world having any relation to the question of teachers pensions. 
These have included in many cases the pensions of industrial groups. The reports of 
the Foundation during these eighteen years contain the most complete literature 
touching pensions and pension systems to be found in any publications in the world. 
The relation of the Foundation to educational development and the studies which 
it has carried on with respect to various current problems in education have occu- 
pied a large part of the activities of the officers and of the staff of the Foundation. 
These studies, which have been published in sixteen bulletins, have concerned them- 
selves not only with special problems such as those of medical education, of legal 
education, and of engineering education, but also with the underlying fundamental 
questions of education which relate to good teaching, to the content of the curric- 
ulum, and to the cost of public education. The establishment of the American Law 
Institute during the present year, by one of the most distinguished groups of judges, 
lawyers, and law teachers ever brought together, is directly related to the studies 
on legal education which the Foundation has carried out through its Division of Edu- 
cational Enquiry. Experience seems to indicate that an agency such as the Founda- 
tion, standing apart from the immediate institutional life and having no constituency 
of its own, can do its greatest service by enlisting in such studies the most able stu- 
dents in different institutions, and that out of the contact brought about in such 
groups between teachers, administrators of school systems, members of the staff of the 
Foundation, and others there is reached a degree of knowledge and of judgment 
with regard to these problems which commands a larger respect and attention than 
can be had from the isolated statement of any one individual. 
Outside of the direct activities involved in the study and establishment of pen- 
sion systems and in the educational enquiries and reports that have been made, the 
officers of the Foundation have necessarily been involved in a number of educational 
relations of a temporary character having to do with the inauguration and opera- 
tion of the educational organizations of the country, such as the College Entrance 
Examination Board, the Association of American Colleges, the Association of Amer- 
ican Universities, the American Council on Education, the American Association of 
University Professors, and the various other organizations of those involved in the 
work of teaching or organization of education. 
It has thus come about that, during the eighteen years of its history, the Foun- 
dation, while pursuing in the main two specific lines of activity—the one having 
to do with pensions and pension systems, the other having to do with educational 
studies— has nevertheless, by the very fact of these activities, been involvedin greater 
or less degree with all those complex relations in educaticn which arise by reason of 
the relationships between the schools of a nation and the various bodies that have 
to do with education. The Foundation has sought, during these years, to be hospit- 
ably minded toward any agency in education that cared for its codperation.

PROGRESS OF INSURANCE AND ANNUITY ASSOCIATION 21 
PROGRESS OF THE TEACHERS INSURANCE AND ANNUITY 
ASSOCIATION 
Wuen the plan of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, operating di- 
rectly with teachers, was first broached, doubt was expressed as to the success of the 
project if no agents were to be employed. How little this doubt was justified is in- 
dicated by the fact that the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association enjoyed 
during its fourth year a continuing and increasing confidence on the part of the uni- 
versity and college teachers in the United States and Canada. 'The comparative table 
below shows a sustained development that is in every way gratifying. 
The Fourth Annual Report of the Board of Trustees for the year 1922 indicated 
a growth unusual among life insurance companies. The assets of the Association in- 
creased during the year by forty per cent, its contracts in force by fifty-two per cent, 
and its premium income by eighty per cent. The Association is rapidly becoming one 
of the largest companies in the country with respect to annuities. As this report goes 
to press, October 1, 1923, the Association has a total of 2901 different policy-holders, 
1750 holding annuity contracts, 1450 holding life insurance policies, and 299 hold- 
ing a combination of the two. 
The number of insurance and annuity contracts in force as of October 1, 1919, 
1920, 1921, 1922, and 1923, is shown in the following table: 
Date No. Ins. Policies Total Ins. No. Annuity Contracts Total Annual Annuity 
October 1, 1919 174 $784,336 113 $109,438 
October 1, 1920 553, 2,795,298 450 494,915 
October 1, 1921 982 4,973,175 776 917,064 
October 1, 1922 1,519 7,928,416 1,175 1,496,174 
October 1, 1923 2,057 10,889,795 1,755 2,267,280 
This record shows that members of the teaching profession are fully capable of 
arranging for their life insurance and old age protection without the medium of the 
agent, when the facts are put before them by means of printed matter and by cor- 
respondence with competent and financially disinterested advisers. While agents may 
be necessary in the commercial life insurance world, they are not needed when deal- 
ing with a highly intelligent and discriminating body such as the faculties of our 
institutions of higher learning. 
The large number of institutions represented by the policy-holders has been a cause 
of especial satisfaction throughout the history of the Association. The increase in this 
number to 413 on October 1, 1923, implies a continued extension. 
The number of universities and colleges that share in the provision of retiring al- 
lowances for their officers and teachers increased during the year (ending June 30, 
1923) to 84, The participation of 21 other institutions of education and research 
makes the total number of contributing institutions 105. 
The additions during the year represent all parts of the country, from Birming- 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
    22 BUSINESS OF THE YEAR 
ham-Southern College and the College of Charleston, to Oberlin College, Brigham 
Young University, and the University of Denver. The University of Arkansas, the 
University of Utah, and The Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina, ‘en- 
larged the number of state-supported institutions that have adopted the contracts of 
the Association. With the addition to the list of the Carnegie Institute of Technol- 
ogy, all of Mr. Carnegie’s large endowments, six in number, have adopted the con- 
tracts of the Association. Four of Mr. Rockefeller’s largest endowments have an- 
nounced their intention of adopting these contracts, beginning with January 1, 1924. 
The complete list of participating universities and colleges given on page 26 now 
includes most of the representative institutions of the United States and Canada. 
Policy-holders are free from all costs of management. In addition the trustees have, 
as in each year heretofore, been able to set aside for all annuity contracts interest at 
the rate of 4 of one per cent in addition to the contractual rate of 4 per cent, the 
highest allowed by law, and also to pay on all insurance policies dividends of 1 per 
cent on the reserve, over the contractual rate of 34 per cent, the highest allowed by 
law, together with a conservative part of the saving from favorable mortality. Pages 
24 to 26 show how far this reduces the cost of insurance provided by the Association 
below that of other legal reserve companies. 
During the year ending June 30, 1923, one insurance contract was terminated by 
death, that of Henry William Brown, professor of English at Colby College. Four 
annuity contracts were so terminated. The proportion of contracts with the Associ- 
ation that are allowed to lapse is negligible when compared with this proportion in 
commercial companies. 
In accordance with the plan of having one-fourth of the trustees of the Association 
elected upon direct nomination by the policy-holders, Thomas Sewall Adams, professor 
of political economy at Yale University, was elected at the fifth annual meeting of the 
stockholders, on November 14, 1922, a trustee for the term of 1922-26. Professor 
Adams received 504 of the 608 votes sent to the policy-holders’ committee. His famil- 
iarity with middle western as well as eastern universities, through his professorships 
at the University of Wisconsin and Washington University, as well as at Cornell 
and Yale, and with state and federal financial administration as assistant to the 
treasurer of Porto Rico, and expert for the Wisconsin Tax Commission, the Depart- 
ment of Commerce and Labor, and the Treasury, will be of particular value to the 
Association. 
It will be recalled that at the inauguration of the plan in 1921, Samuel McCune 
Lindsay, professor of social legislation, Columbia University, was elected a trustee 
for the term 1921-25. The policy-holders’ committee will meet on October 6, 1923, 
for the nomination of a third trustee, for the term 1923-27. 
The number and distribution of the contracts in force made it possible for the 
trustees at their annual meeting, on November 14, 1922, to increase, beginning with 
January, 1923, the maximum amount of insurance that will be written upon the life
-P-A-G-E-33
  PROGRESS OF INSURANCE AND ANNUITY ASSOCIATION 23 
of one person to $25,000, provided that not more than $10,000 of this amount be 
on a plan involving term insurance. In this matter the trustees have practised a 
sound conservatism. The original maximum of $5000, adopted in 1918, was increased 
to $10,000 in 1919, to $15,000 in 1920, to $20,000 in 1921, and beginning with 1923, 
to $25,000. 
In 1921 the officers of the Association asked the opinion of policy-holders concern- 
ing the desirability of attaching to the life insurance policies of the Association, 
not to the annuity contracts, a provision, like that offered by nearly all commercial 
companies, calling for the payment of a certain income in the event of total perma- 
nent disability occurring before the age of sixty. Only fifteen per cent of the policy- 
holders expressed an interest in such a contract. 
Since that time the officers have made extensive enquiry as to the possibility of 
contracts providing an income in case of disability unfitting the holder for the work 
of a teacher. Studies are being made of the incidence among teachers of disability such 
as would incapacitate them for further teaching and would unfit them for engaging 
in any work offering a substantial financial return. Meanwhile, the life insurance con- 
tracts of the Association provide for their continuance in full force without further 
payment of premiums in case the insured becomes totally and permanently disabled 
before reaching the age of sixty-five, and teachers who care to do so may procure dis- 
ability income protection in separate contracts from various commercial companies. 
One of the growing services of the Association is the provision of full and disin- 
terested information concerning annuity and insurance protection for university and 
college teachers. It is gratifying to note that an increasing number of agents, realizing 
that their companies cannot hope to compete with the very low net cost of the Asso- 
ciation, are advising teachers to insure for the maximum amount in the Association. 
The Life Insurance Courant, one of the leading periodicals in the field of insur- 
ance, printed the following appreciation of the work of the Association in its issue for 
July, 1923: 
“The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America is a regularly 
incorporated life insurance company of New York, and is subject to the super- 
vision of the State Superintendent of Insurance. 
“This Association was organized in 1916 at the instance of the Carnegie Foun- 
dation for the Advancement of Teaching. Its paid-in capital of $500,000 and sur- 
plus of an equal amount were contributed by the Carnegie Corporation of New 
York, and they are, respectively, five and ten times the legal requirement. Besides 
giving security additional to that furnished by the full legal policy reserves, the 
paid-in capital and surplus furnish an income for the expenses of management, 
resulting in substantial annual savings to the pelea taney. The Association 
: oor by aboard of sixteen trustees, four of whom are chosen by the policy- 
olders. 
“Its charter specifically stipulates that the business of the Association is to be 
conducted without profit to the Corporation or to its stockholders, and this en- 
ables the Association to offer insurance and annuities to college teachers at cost, 
 
-P-A-G-E-34

  BUSINESS OF THE YEAR 
without the customary loading for expenses. There are no overhead charges which 
in the ordinary company absorb a considerable proportion of the premium paid 
by the policy-holders, and this results in a considerable saving to the policy- 
holders, ranging anywhere from about 15 to 45 per cent depending upon the plan 
and age at issue. 
“Not only are the policy-holders relieved of all costs of management but in 
addition the trustees have been able to set aside for all annuity contracts interest 
at the rate of one-half of one per cent in addition to the contractual rate of 4 
per cent, the highest allowed by law, and also to pay on all insurance policies 
dividends of one per cent on the reserve, over the contractual rate of 3} per cent, 
together with a conservative part of the saving from favorable mortality. While 
the policies are written as non-participating contracts they are thus in effect 
participating annual dividend policies. 
“The Association has great financial backing and its strength and security are 
unquestionable, At the end of 1922 it had surplus of $645,376 in addition to its 
capital of $500,000, and its total assets were then $2,220,294. 
“The Association has a splendid life insurance proposition for college profes- 
sors and teachers, and we believe that the life insurance men of the country gen- 
erally might well serve the interests of such men and women by recommending 
the Association to them.” 
The following tables present most emphatically the large savings made by policy- 
holders in the Association. Many making comparisons have failed to realize that these 
continue year after year. 
The net costs given for the first year are the premiums which appear in the poli- 
cies. Those for subsequent years are after allowance for dividends actually paid. The 
dividends at the end of the first policy year can be obtained by subtracting net costs 
given for the second year from the initial costs. Similarly, second year dividends are 
the difference between the initial and net costs shown for the third year. 
All policies of the Association are on standard forms, and comparisons are here 
made with similar policies. The premiums of the Association include the Disability 
Waiver of Premium charge.

FORMAL ACTION OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF OLD AGE ANNUITIES 
Tur last four reports of the president of the Foundation included various resolutions 
used in adopting the contributory system of annuities by universities and colleges. 
The total number of such institutions increased to eighty-four through the adop- 
tion of the plan, during the year July 1, 1922, to June 30, 1923, by the University 
of Arkansas, Birmingham-Southern College, Brigham Young University, Carnegie 
Institute of Technology, the College of Charleston, The Citadel, the University of 
Denver, Oberlin College, Peking Union Medical College, and the University of Utah 
(10). The more suggestive of the resolutions used by them are printed below, together 
with a new set of resolutions adopted by Princeton University, removing certain limi- 
tations in earlier regulations that were pointed out in the Seventeenth Annual Report 
of the Foundation.

THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS 
Action of the Board of Trustees April 22, 1923. 
The Board of Trustees of the University of Arkansas adopts, for the retirement of 
its administrative officers and teachers, the contributory plan of the Teachers In- 
surance and Annuity Association of America. 
1. For each full-time teacher or research worker resident at Fayetteville, above 
the grade of instructor, and for each of the following full-time administrative officers, 
namely, the President of the University, the Deans of the Colleges, the Dean of Wo- 
men, the Director of University Extension, the Registrar, the Chief Financial Officer, 
the Executive Secretary to the President, and the Librarian, who elects to enter the 
contributory plan, and who continues to contribute a percentage of his annual salary, 
the Board of Trustees will pay annually, in monthly installments throughout the 
period during which it employs him, and during which he so contributes, a like sum 
not exceeding five per cent. of his annual salary; provided that no teacher or officer 
shall be eligible to this privilege until he has had two years of service in the university. 
2. Each participating administrative officer or teacher holds a separate personal 
contract with the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association. This contract is the 
property of the individual teacher or officer, and all payments on the contract,whether 
made by himself or by the University, accumulate for his benefit. Since the University 
is a co-contributor for a definite end, namely, support for the participant’s old age, it 
is understood that in all cases the annuity policy or policies shall be deposited with 
the President of the University under the agreement that they shall not be assigned, 
pledged or surrendered without consent of the President, so long as the University 
continues its contribution. 
3. The obligation of the University to pay these annual amounts towards the ac- 
cumulation of an annuity for the participant is of the same nature and extent as its 
obligation to pay the participant’s salary, and will cease when the participant be- 
comes sixty-five years of age. The amount of such contribution, as of the salary, may 
be hereafter increased, decreased, or withdrawn, should circumstances make such 
change advisable. 
   
-P-A-G-E-38
    28 BUSINESS OF THE YEAR 
4. Retirement shall be optional at the age of sixty-five, to be put into effect at 
the choice of the Board of Trustees or of the one who is to be retired; but after the 
age of seventy the retirement shall be compulsory, unless the Board annually re-elects. 
5. In view of its payments the governing body of the University desires to make 
clear that all teachers, officers, or permanent employees, eligible to this plan, who 
do not elect to participate in it, will have no basis of claim upon the University for 
retiring allowances in old age. 
OBERLIN COLLEGE 
Action of the Trustees, January 18, 1923. 
RESOLUTIONS 
ConcERNING THE GRANTING oF ContTRIBUTORY PENSIONS 
1. That the practice of granting non-contributory pensions to teachers and admin- 
istrative officers of the College be discontinued as to those who retire after August 
31, 1924, except as hereinafter provided. 
2. That the College adopt for the retirement of all teachers and administrative 
officers of the grade of instructor and above, who are not eligible for the non-con- 
tributory pensions of the Carnegie Foundation, and who retire after August 31, 1924, 
the contributory pension plan, as now established by the Carnegie Foundation and 
operated through the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America. 
3. That participation in the new plan be optional in the case of teachers and offi- 
cers entering the service of the College prior to September 1, 1923, but obligatory 
upon all teachers and officers entering after that date; that eligibility for partici- 
pation begin upon the attainment of permanent appointment, or, in the absence of 
such appointment, at the end of three years of service. 
4. That the College contribute to the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Associa- 
tion, from September 1, 1922, a sum equal to five percent of the annual salary of 
teachers and officers eligible under the terms of Paragraph 3 and who accept parti- 
cipation in the new plan, provided an equal payment be made by the teachers and 
officers themselves; that the payments of the College begin upon receipt of the written 
request of the teacher or officer that the College retain five percent of his monthly 
salary and make the entire payment to the Association; that in case of the with- 
drawal of the teacher, voluntarily, or involuntarily, from the service of the College, 
all obligation of the College to contribute cease. 
5. That the amount upon which the College pays its five percent be the regular 
salary of the teacher or officer concerned, up to a maximum annual salary of $4,500, 
but not including any additional sum paid for special services. 
6. That when the joint contributions of the College and the teacher or officer, 
each at the rate of five percent, reach a sum sufficient, under the terms of the policy 
of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, to produce a retiring allowance
-P-A-G-E-39
  ACTION OF INSTITUTIONS ON OLD AGE ANNUITIES 29 
of $1,800 annually for the teacher or officer himself at the age of 68 plus $900 for 
his wife as provided in Option III of Section XIII of the Non-Participating De- 
ferred Annuity Policy, the obligation of the College to contribute shall cease. 
1. That if a teacher or officer elects, in order to increase the amount of his retiring 
allowance, to make his contributions at a higher rate or upon a larger amount than 
the College does, the College be not relieved thereby in any degree from its obli- 
gation to continue its payments until they alone reach a sum sufficient, under the 
terms of the policy of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, to produce 
half of a retiring allowance of $1,800 annually for the teacher or officer himself at 
the age of 68, plus $900 for his wife, as provided in Option III of Section XIII of 
the Non-Participating Deferred Annuity Policy, unless the teacher or officer reaches 
the age of retirement before such a sum is reached. 
8. That when the joint contributions of the College and a teacher or officer who 
entered the service of the College before November 20, 1918, but is eligible for a 
non-contributory pension from the Carnegie Foundation, are insufficient, under the 
terms of the policy of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, to produce 
a retiring allowance of $1,800 annually for the teacher or officer himself at the age 
of 68 plus $900 for his wife, as provided in Option III of Section XIII of the Non- 
Participating Deferred Annuity Policy, the College supplement these allowances with 
amounts sufficient to bring the whole annuity up to $1,800 for the teacher or officer 
himself at the age of 68 plus $900 for his wife, as provided in Option III of Section 
XIII of the Non-Participating Deferred Annuity Policy; Provided, however, that 
an unmarried teacher shall not be eligible for more than the allowance of $1,800 for 
himself or herself, that a widow who has not been the wife of a teacher for ten years 
before his retirement shall not be eligible for any supplementary allowance, and that 
the supplementary allowance to a widow shall cease in the event of her remarriage. 
9. That when a husband and wife are both teachers or officers in the institution, 
the College do not make contributions toward annuities for both, nor toward an 
annuity for the wife whose husband is eligible for a non-contributory pension from 
the Carnegie Foundation; but in either case, in the event of the death of the hus- 
band before retirement, the widow immediately becomes eligible to participate in 
the contributory pension plan, and, if the joint contributions of the College and 
herself prove insufficient to produce an annuity of $1,800 at her retirement, to re- 
ceive a supplementary allowance from the College sufficient to make, in the judgment 
of the Board of Trustees, her entire allowance from return of premiums in event of 
husband’s death plus her own annuity from the Teachers Insurance and Annuity 
Association and the College equivalent to an annuity of $1,800. 
10. That if a teacher eligible to retire under these rules with an annuity from the 
Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association and a supplementary allowance from 
the College desires to retire before reaching the age of 68, he be allowed to do so 
at the end of any year after reaching his sixty-fifth birthday, with the benefits of
-P-A-G-E-40
    30 BUSINESS OF THE YEAR 
his annuity contract, in which case however any supplementary allowance from the 
College would be for such amount as would reduce the maximum (total) retiring 
allowance by one-fifteenth for each year by which his age is less than sixty-eight. 
11. That the teacher’s policy be deposited with the Treasurer of the College, with 
an agreement that it shall not be surrendered or pledged for loans without the con- 
sent of the Board of Trustees. 
12. All the provisions of the foregoing are based on the policy of the Teachers 
Insurance and Annuity Association as now written and are to be construed in accord- 
ance therewith. 
13. That the College reserve the right to make exceptions to these rules in special 
cases, and to revise this plan in such ways as experience may prove to the Board of 
Trustees to be necessary or desirable; but such changes shall not affect teachers and 
officers who have entered into the plan prior to the adoption of the changes, except 
by mutual agreement. 
PRINCETON UNIVERSITY 
Action of the Board of Trustees, April 12, 1923. 
Rule for Retirement 
Any member of the University teaching staff may retire at age sixty-five, and 
every member must retire at age sixty-eight; provided, however, that in special cases, 
by a vote of the Board of Trustees of the University, an individual may be continued 
in active service beyond the retiring age for periods not exceeding three years from 
the time of any special vote taken. If the retiring age occurs during an academic year, 
retirement shall become effective and date from the end of the current academic year. 
University Plan for Retiring Allowances and Insurance 
1, Every member so retiring shall be entitled to receive during the remainder of 
his life an annual retiring allowance equal to one-half of his annual salary as teacher 
at retirement; provided that the obligation of the University shall be reduced by the 
amount of any Carnegie or similar allowance to which any such member may be en- 
titled. Any member so retiring, not immediately entitled to a Carnegie allowance, 
shall receive from the University his half salary as above defined (with such addi- 
tions thereto as may be necessary to qualify him for the maximum Carnegie allow- 
ance) until he is entitled to maximum allowance under the Carnegie rules. Any mem- 
ber of the teaching staff who is entitled to a Carnegie retiring allowance and who 
forfeits such retiring allowance because of any voluntary act by which the same is 
forfeited under the Carnegie rules, may be deprived of his retiring allowance from 
the University. The annual retiring allowance above provided shall in no case exceed 
the sum of $3,250. 
2. The foregoing plan will be subject to modification or the adoption of any other 
plan equally advantageous to retiring Faculty members.
-P-A-G-E-41

8. The University will issue to each professor, associate professor and assistant pro- 
fessor a death benefit certificate assuring him that in case of his death before retire- 
ment and while he continues an active member of the teaching staff of the Univer- 
sity, it will pay the sum of $5,000 to his wife, if he leave one, otherwise to his chil- 
dren, or, if he leave none, then to such person or persons as he may, with the approval 
of the President, designate. 
4, The trustees will give special consideration to the circumstances of each of the 
following cases as they arise: 
(a) A member of the teaching staff suffering temporary disability; 
(6) The widow of a retired member of the teaching staff; 
(c) Amember of the teaching staff retired before the age of sixty-eight for incapa- 
city, inefficiency or other good cause, under the procedure adopted by the Board on 
June 15, 1918. 
  Alternative Plan 
If any member of the teaching staff of the University holds or obtains a deferred 
annuity policy providing for the payment to him of an annuity after retirement at 
the age of sixty-five or over, issued by the Teachers’ Insurance and Annuity Associ- 
ation of America, or by such other company as is approved by the Finance Committee 
of the University, the University will, on his request and the relinquishment by him 
of all benefits under the University Plan for Retiring Allowances and Insurance above 
defined, and on being satisfied that his plan of insurance meets the purposes thereof, 
contribute each year toward the payment of his premiums on such annuity policy an 
amount equal to the sum contributed by such member, not, however, exceeding five 
per cent. of his salary for said year, nor a maximum of $300 per year; provided that 
(a) No contribution shall be made for an instructor until he has completed two 
years of service in Princeton University; 
(b) No contribution shall be made after the end of the academic year during which 
the member attains the age of sixty-five, nor after such member leaves the employ- 
ment of the University. 
(c) The teacher’s policy shall be deposited with the Treasurer of the University, 
with an agreement that it shall not be surrendered or pledged for loans without the 
consent of the Trustees. 
(d) No contribution shall be made by the University for a teacher entitled to a 
Carnegie Foundation annuity; 
(e) When as the result of the contributions already made by the University and 
the annuitant, the annuity pledge to the member at the age of sixty-five years shall 
reach $3,000 annually, all further obligation on the part of the University shall 
cease; 
(f) The University reserves the right from time to time to modify, amend or 
abrogate this alternative plan. 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  82 BUSINESS OF THE YEAR 
THE LIFE EXPECTATION OF COLLEGE TEACHERS 
Tue nature of the risk which the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association assumes 
in writing insurance policies and annuity contracts for college teachers is of course 
dependent on the expectation of life of teachers. In a similar way the load ultimately 
to fall upon the resources of the Carnegie Foundation depends upon the nature of 
this expectation. 
Hitherto there have been no exact data concerning the nature of this expectation. 
It has been assumed that the college teacher was a good risk, and as a basis of com- 
puting the cost of the risk, both the actuaries of the Insurance and Annuity Asso- 
ciation and of the Foundation have assumed the risk derived from McClintock’s Male 
Annuitants’ Tables, the standard tables upon which insurance companies base their 
annuity rates, and which are prescribed by the New York State Insurance Depart- 
ment for the valuation of annuity contracts. 
The actuary of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association has kept track 
constantly of the experience of the Foundation, in order to derive from that experi- 
ence whatever information might throw light upon the life expectation of the teach- 
ers who have expectations from the Foundation or who hold insurance or annuity 
contracts from the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association. 
During the past year, a study has been made of the experience of the Carnegie 
Foundation with respect to the expectation of life of those receiving retiring allow- 
ances during the past eighteen years. The number of lives involved was six hundred 
and sixty-six. The total number of deaths expected from the tables during this period 
was three hundred and sixty. The actual number of deaths was three hundred and 
twenty, or eighty-nine per cent of the deaths expected. Eliminating cases of disability, 
the actual deaths were but eighty-three per cent of those expected from the tables. 
It may well be that the number of lives involved is too small and the period cov- 
ered too short to warrant any trustworthy conclusions. However, a comparison with 
the mortality expected in accordance with a new table—that of the American Annu- 
itants —gives results so close to these that it seems reasonable to conclude that the 
mortality will follow closely the experience indicated during these eighteen years. 
The American Annuitants Table reflects the experience of twenty American com- 
panies, issuing fully ninety-five per cent of the immediate annuities on single lives 
granted in the United States up to 1918. 
The significance of the result just referred to, should the experience of the future 
correspond with that of the past eighteen years, is evident. The deferred annuity con- 
tracts of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association are based on the McClin- 
tock Tables and four per cent compound interest. If the mortality among those re- 
ceiving contractual annuities should conform with that of the men pensioners of the 
Foundation during the past eighteen years, the interest earnings on the invested pre- 
miums in excess of those allowed on the contracts must be large enough to offset the
-P-A-G-E-43
  THE ABUSE OF INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS 33 
larger amounts to be paid out in consequence of the increased longevity over that 
contemplated under the McClintock Tables. Excess interest earnings of approximately 
one-half of one per cent would be sufficient to overcome such an increased longevity, 
should it take place. The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association has earned a 
margin greater than this from the beginning, and is now putting into a special reserve 
fund excess interest earnings equal to one-half of one per cent to supplement the 
regular legal reserve on the McClintock four per cent basis. 
The mortality among disability pensioners of the Foundation was also examined. 
While the number of cases was small—being only forty-seven in all —it is interest- 
ing to note that the rate of mortality among the disabled lives was twenty per cent 
higher than that expected by Hunter’s Disability Tables. This indicates that teach- 
ers have applied for disability allowances only in cases of severe need, and that the 
Foundation has granted such disability allowances only in such cases. 
The fact that the mortality among the entire body of men pensioners of the Foun- 
dation is but eighty per cent of that expected under the American Experience Table, 
which is the standard life insurance table, leads to the conclusion that the Association 
may safely issue life insurance policies at the higher ages so long as the applicant 
passes a satisfactory medical examination. 
THE ABUSE OF INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS 
Tur Carnegie Foundation, through its Division of Educational Enquiry, has con- 
ducted, year after year, a series of studies the results of which are published in the 
form of bulletins. There have each year been laid before the executive committee 
applications for many such enquiries on the part of the Foundation which it was un- 
able to undertake. It has been the policy of the trustees, in carrying out these studies, 
to seek in each case to do a serious and thorough piece of work. In making the studies 
the Foundation has relied, not wholly on the members of its own staff, but in all cases 
has called together representatives of those directly in touch with the particular prob- 
lem which it was seeking to study. 
Experience has likewise indicated that the Division of Educational Enquiry could 
do its largest service, not only by making a thorough study of a question at a given 
epoch, but by following up through a series of years the development in that field in 
which the study lay. For example, thirteen years ago the Foundation published the 
admirable study of Medical Education by Mr. Abraham Flexner. It has continued, 
up to the present time, to follow up that study by constant reviews of the situation 
with respect to medical education. It is believed that such a procedure has a cumula- 
tive result. 
Among the subjects of study to which the attention of the trustees has been most 
frequently called is that of the state of intercollegiate athletics. There have been con- 
stant complaints that the intercollegiate contests were leading both institutions and 
 
-P-A-G-E-44

students into expenditures out of proportion to any reasonable standard, and that 
the sharpness of the rivalry had injured, in many instances, the standards under which 
students were admitted. It was also claimed that there were other coincident sources 
of demoralization, such as the interference with work, the large amount of betting 
incident to the sharp rivalry, and other objectionable features. 
Hitherto the Foundation has not found itself able to undertake a study of the 
question of intercollegiate athletics. It had on hand other studies which, for the mo- 
ment, could not be laid aside, and the trustees have not felt convinced that this field 
was one in which the Foundation was called upon, in the past, to enter. 
The request was again brought to the attention of the trustees during the past 
year. Almost coincident with the presentation of the matter to the Foundation the 
Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools of the Southern States had appointed 
a committee of five to enquire into the condition and administration of athletics in 
the colleges that are members of that association, with full authority and instruc- 
tions to investigate entrance credits of athletes, their records in college, past academic 
record, absences from college, the salaries of coaches and by whom paid, and such other 
matters as pertain to the wholesomeness of intercollegiate athletic games. This com- 
mittee was without funds for the prosecution of its enquiry. Inasmuch, however, as 
its members served without pay and only a modest sum was required for the expenses 
of the committee, the trustees of the Foundation decided to allocate to the commit- 
tee a sum not exceeding $1000, in order to enable them to make an enquiry into the 
situation of intercollegiate athletics in the colleges composing their own association. 
The report of that committee has recently been completed and brings to light cer- 
tain suggestive and interesting facts touching the conduct of competitive athletics 
in these colleges and universities. The enquiry of the committee was carried on, in 
large measure, through a questionnaire sent out to forty-three institutions, members 
of the association, and to twenty-seven not members of the association. Replies were 
received from twenty-seven of the associated institutions and from six of the non- 
associated institutions. This method of investigation was probably the only one that 
the committee could undertake, but it is clear that the method is open to certain 
objections by reason of the fact that the institutions in which abuses are greatest are 
those least likely to furnish the information desired. Of the institutions from which 
replies were received, six were in Virginia, five in Kentucky, four in Texas, three each 
in North Carolina and Tennessee, two each in Alabama, Georgia, and West Virginia, 
and one each in the District of Columbia, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, 
and South Carolina. 
The committee arranged the replies to its questionnaire in a tabular form, sepa- 
rating the replies from members of the association from the replies of colleges not 
members of the association. It is the judgment of the committee, as based upon a 
study of these records, that there is a healthier condition in athletics in these southern 
states than would be indicated by the general comment and rumor heard on all sides.
-P-A-G-E-45
THE ABUSE OF INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS 35 
It is, of course, a question how far these reports reflect the situation in institutions 
which preferred to make no report. 
The committee’s statistics give definite and interesting information concerning a 
number of matters. 
The report shows that faculty control is practically universal in matters of eligi- 
bility of players, entrance requirements, and scholastic standing, but that in many 
cases this control does not extend to the finances, to the selection of coaches, or to 
the arrangement of schedules, in which alumni have a voice out of proportion to that 
of the faculty. The committee believes that good may be accomplished by the estab- 
lishment, on the part of institutions, of regular departments of physical education 
with a man of professorial rank at the head. 
The committee found that the maximum annual expenditure (season of 1921) in 
any one college for athletics was $109,797.41. The second largest annual expenditure 
was $57,000. The minimum was $1320.27. The average expenditure for the twenty- 
six associated colleges that made returns was $24,334.09. Nine exceeded this aver- 
age and seventeen fell below it. The committee expresses the belief that the great 
and constantly growing cost of intercollegiate athletics constitutes one of the grav- 
est abuses. The harm lies, in their judgment, not only in the extravagance engendered 
in undergraduates, but in the over-exaggeration in the mind of the student of the 
relative importance of athletics in the general scheme of college work. The committee 
finds that, in order to meet this constantly growing burden, admission to games is 
putas high as the traffic will bear, and that some institutions make substantial profits 
out of the operations of the football season. The committee recommends, as worthy 
of consideration, the elimination of gate receipts and the making admission to games 
strictly a matter of invitation. 
The committee finds that, among the colleges whose replies were received, the sal- 
aries of the head coaches in football range from $400 a year to $7000, the average 
being a little over $3000. The man receiving the salary of $7000 was employed for 
part-time only and did not rank as a member of the faculty. The salary of the head 
coach in many institutions exceeded that of the representative professor. 
The committee draws the conclusion that the athletic coach, and in particular the 
football coach, sets the standard of the whole system of intercollegiate sports and is 
responsible for many of its most demoralizing features. It recommends that the coach 
should be a member of the faculty employed for the full session and elected by the 
faculty or other college authorities, that his salary should be paid by the institution, 
and not by alumni or other organizations, and should in nowise be contingent on the 
winning of certain critical games. The committee urges that a coach of high charac- 
ter and with a right sense of the relation of his work to that of other departments 
of the institution has an opportunity to exert an influence for good greater than 
that of almost any other man associated with the college. 
The committee went with care into the record of the entrance credits of the men 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
36 BUSINESS OF THE YEAR 
admitted to various college teams. They report that in some cases students with very 
low standards were admitted to these teams, and such students were in most cases 
“special” students. Some of the subjects which were credited for admission to college 
were of an extraordinary kind. For example, one ’Varsity player was credited with 
preparation in eight courses — two in English, one in mathematics, one in science, 
and four in “others.” The committee was not able to determine what was covered 
by the specification — “others.” In order to admit certain promising athletes, frac- 
tions of courses were counted—a principle which the committee strongly condemns. 
The committee also recommends that students admitted on account of having reached. 
an age beyond that of the ordinary undergraduate, and who are unable to satisfy 
the full entrance requirements, should not be allowed to participate in intercollegiate 
games. They designate the playing of “special” students as one of the easiest and 
surest channels for the introduction of “ringers” and other undesirable men into the 
college contests. Eleven of the institutions examined permit special students with- 
out full entrance requirements to play on their ’Varsity teams. 
One institution described by the committee reports that it has thirty-one schol- 
arships which are reserved for students of special athletic ability, and that the alumni 
of the college raise a fund annually to pay board, room rent, and other minor college 
expenses of its athletes. The same institution states its belief that one of the great 
evils of intercollegiate athletics lies in the commercializing of the standards of athletic 
ability. This antinomy would scarcely seem to need comment. 
Twenty of the colleges were opposed to the practice of “scouting” for athletic 
material, six had no definite opinion on the subject, and two were in favor of it. The 
committee condemns this practice in the strongest way, and states that any head 
coach who really desires to do so can usually control this situation. The committee 
suggests that the principals of preparatory schools should take a hand in stopping 
this practice, and it expresses the opinion that the harm done to the boy in the 
high school by the present athletic system is greater than that done in the college. 
The committee believes that the boy coming under such influence at a younger and 
more impressionable age is more profoundly influenced by its conditions, and it be- 
lieves also that the newspaper publicity, betting on games, trips away from home, 
transfer of high school athletes from one school district to another, all tend to make 
the abuses in the preparatory schools as great, if not greater, than in the colleges. 
The reports received by the committee show that the maximum number of days’ 
absence allowed for the purpose of taking part in intercollegiate athletics ranges from 
zero to twenty days per session, with an average of about fourteen. The committee con- 
siders that the playing of intercollegiate games in distant cities, where only a small 
percentage of the student body of either institution can witness the games, is wholly 
bad and is a purely commercial enterprise. This practice, in the opinion of the com- 
mittee, is one of the great contributing causes to the growing spirit of commercialism 
in intercollegiate athletics. The committee recommends that the playing of games on  
-P-A-G-E-47
  THE ABUSE OF INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS 37 
neutral territory, under the auspices of commercial organizations, fairs, and other 
bodies, should be strongly discouraged. 
The committee reports that betting is a growing feature of the more important 
football contests. It finds that many alumni regard a bet on their college team as 
an expression of loyalty to Alma Mater, and it concludes that students are greatly 
influenced in this practice by the sight of their elder brothers and their relatives thus 
supporting the team by risking money upon its success, A greater danger will come, 
in the opinion of the committee, when the professional gambler, always alert fora place 
to ply his trade, may decide to turn his attention to intercollegiate football. 
The committee, in its summary of the abuses incident to present-day intercollegi- 
ate contests, names them as follows: 
Commercialism. 
Excessive expenditure of money. 
Too great an insistence on turning out a winning team. 
“Scouting” for athletes in the preparatory schools. 
Too great temptation for the smaller institutions to try to rival the larger ones 
in athletics. 
Too great emphasis upon the “training” of athletes. 
Tendency toward over-emphasis on the part of the alumni and general public of 
the feleitve importance of athletics. 
Too much newspaper publicity. 
Temptation to administrators and executives to use the athletic reputation of 
the institution as a means of securing appropriations and endowment. 
Gambling. 
Intercollegiate sports of benefit to too few students. 
As a means of eliminating these abuses, the committee received various suggestions. 
One institution proposes frankly that intercollegiate athletics be abolished. Others 
suggest reorganization of athletics for the benefit of the entire student body, another 
the limitation of athletic budgets, others elimination of the paid coach. 
The committee is of the opinion that with control of athletic policies and prac- 
tices entirely in the hands of the president and the faculty, and with each institution 
making conscientious efforts to eliminate the abuses within its own walls, many of the 
evils noted would rapidly disappear. The committee regrets that many colleges and 
universities are afraid to undertake these problems. They stand in fear of their neigh- 
bors, of their alumni, of the general public, of the newspapers, and of the legislatures 
which deal out appropriations. The committee is of the opinion that a real solution 
of the problem comes back to common honesty on the part of the college in the regu- 
lation of its own affairs, and that any college that so desires and that has the courage 
of its convictions can have clean athletics. 
The question of the honesty and value of intercollegiate athletics comes back, in 
their judgment, to a question of the honesty, the integrity, and the courage of those 
who direct the college.

THE INFLUENCE OF ALUMNI UPON THEIR COLLEGES 
Tue report of this committee with respect to the status of college athletics in the 
Southern States cannot but raise some apprehension in the minds of reflecting men. 
The abuses of intercollegiate athletics in southern colleges are certainly no greater 
than in other parts of the country, butit is quite clear, from this report and from sim- 
ilar enquiries, that the conduct of intercollegiate athletics has brought upon educa- 
tional institutions in general very definite weaknesses, whatever positive value may 
have come with them. Apart from the evils of commercialism, extravagance, the temp- 
tation to gambling, and other similar by-products, the exploitation of intercollegiate 
athletics has distorted the perspective of the college life. In the eyes of the student 
body success in such contests far outweighs that of scholarly work and the old-time 
academic virtues of simplicity, sincerity, and faithfulness to study. This situation has 
come about as the result of many contributing factors—the universal tendency of 
American people to excessive expenditures, the exploitation of athletics by the daily 
papers, the lack of keen interest in the rewards of scholarship, and the propaganda car- 
ried on by the athletic organizations. The most disturbing feature of this whole situ- 
ation lies in the fact that the college governing boards, and sometimes the faculties, 
seem to have abandoned, without any sufficient effort, the attempt to keep organized 
athletics within a field where such contests would be secondary to the intellectual life 
of the college. For the bad features of the existing situation, those who have to do with 
the government and conduct of the colleges are primarily responsible. Many college 
trustees, and a large proportion of college professors, are keenly alive to this responsi- 
bility. The unwise competition that has gone on between American colleges has hith- 
erto exercised so powerful an influence in favor of the exploitation of intercollegiate 
athletics that neither the trustees nor the faculties have had the courage to resist it. 
The report of the committee, summarized in the preceding section, draws atten- 
tion in a specific way to the influence of alumni upon their institutions. For the last 
two decades a movement has been in progress under which alumni, through their or- 
ganizations, are furnishing an increasing proportion of college trustees. This move- 
ment has had its origin in considerable measure in the desire of trustees to obtain the 
support and codperation of alumni in securing funds. This expectation has been meas- 
urably successful. Alumni of most colleges and universities, and in particular of our 
older institutions, have, through their organizations, drawn into the treasuries of 
their respective institutions large sums of money that otherwise would not have been 
obtained. Some of these alumni campaigns for money have far exceeded the bounds of 
good taste in university matters. In this respect the Canadian institutions have set an 
example to their cousins in the United States which might well be noted. They have 
conducted their campaigns for funds needed by their institutions within the bounds 
of academic good taste. Some of our efforts in this direction, even in our oldest insti- 
tutions, have resembled nothing so much as the Booster Clubs of our Western cities.
-P-A-G-E-49
THE INFLUENCE OF ALUMNI UPON THEIR COLLEGES 39 
  The story of the influence of alumni associations in the athletic interests of their 
colleges raises some question as to how far alumni representation on the boards of trus- 
tees has been helpful toward sound educational progress. So far as the evidences go, 
alumni trustees the country over have thrown the weight of their influence toward 
a policy of exploitation of athletics rather than toward an increase in the scholarly 
fruitfulness of their institutions. In any event, it would seem apparent from the his- 
tory of the last twenty years that those alumni who have gained position and in- 
fluence with their colleges have been chiefly from the number of those whose inter- 
ests lay in athletic competition rather than in scholarly development. There are, of 
course, exceptions to this state of affairs, and notable exceptions in certain institu- 
tions. Nevertheless, so far as the general influence of alumni upon their institutions 
has been made manifest, it may fairly be said that alumni influence has been exerted 
rather in the exploitation side of their universities than in the development of their 
steady and serious work. 
The question of the selection of a fitting governing body for an educational insti- 
tution is one of the most important with which an institution can concern itself. 
There has been a growing tendency in the United States, on the part of alumni asso- 
ciations, to claim an increasing share in the administration of their colleges. Some- 
times this claim has been put upon the wrong ground. Some alumni associations have 
taken the attitude that their institution belonged primarily to them and that in some 
fashion or other it owed them something. In one sense an institution does belong to its 
alumni—in the sense of devotion and affection. In another, the alumnus is indebted 
to his institution, not the institution to him. Even in the universities having the 
largest income, the expense of the education of the student is in a large measure paid 
by the public. Every alumnus leaves his college in debt to the institution for part of 
the cost of his education. In many cases he owes it a still greater debt for the intel- 
lectual and cultural inspiration that he kas found within its walls. In any case the 
alumnus is in no position to claim a place on the board of trustees except upon the 
ground of his fitness to render service to it. That fitness will depend, in large mea- 
sure, on whether he expects his service to be mainly in the promotion of athletics or 
in the development of the intellectual and cultural interests of his institution. The 
tendency to place institutions of learning more and more in the hands of their gradu- 
ates is one that ought to be examined with great care. It is a distinct obligation upon 
the graduates themselves to make clear to the public that they hold their trustee- 
ships, not because they are alumni, but because they are preéminently fit to serve on 
a governing board.

LEGAL EDUCATION 
In addition to brief discussions contained in successive Annual Reports, beginning 
with the Eighth (1913), three special extended bulletins dealing with legal education 
and cognate matters have been issued: 
Number Eight: The Common Law and the Case Method in American University 
Law Schools, 1915. 
Number Thirteen: Justice and the Poor, 1919. 
Number Fifteen: Training for the Public Profession of the Law, 1921. 
A fourth bulletin, discussing more in detail the present condition of law schools, 
is now in an advanced stage of preparation. It is hoped that proofs will be ready for 
distribution among the law schools during the coming academic year. 
COMPARATIVE PROFESSIONAL STATISTICS 
A previous Annual Report contained a table showing the comparative number of 
physicians and surgeons, of clergymen, and of lawyers, as computed by the United 
States Census Bureau between 1880 and 1910.! The following table, in the same form, 
includes the census returns of 1920:

This table shows that the number of physicians and surgeons, and of lawyers, in 
proportion to the population, reached its peak in 1900. Since then, there has been 
a progressive decline until now there are relatively fewer members of each of these 
professions than in 1880. The decline has been most marked in the case of the physi- 
cians during the last decade, when this profession increased less than one-third as 
fast as the population— this in spite of the fact that “healers” and “osteopaths” 
are included. The decrease in the relative number of lawyers has been greater during 
the last twenty years, but was more marked between 1900 and 1910 than between 
1910 and 1920. During the first of these decades this profession increased less than 
one-third as fast as the population, and during the second somewhat over one-half as 
fast. Clergymen, on the other hand, if religious and charity workers are included, have 
recently shown a substantial increase. Physicians have always outnumbered lawyers 
in this country. Now, for the first time, “clergymen,” as above defined, outnumber 
even physicians. 
Owing to the manner in which the Bureau of the Census collected and tabulated its 
figures during the earlier years, the above comparison of professional figures is the best 
that can be made for a period covering more than a single decade. Only for the last 
decade is it possible to construct a table which on the one hand brings into compari- 
son three broadly distinguished professional groups, concerned respectively with the 
healing arts, with religion and welfare, and with the law; and on the other hand distin- 
guishes between the subordinate elements of which each of these groups is composed. 
Only for the last decade also is it possible to add to these three sets of figures a corre- 
sponding one for the engineering profession. A table constructed on this basis follows:

It appears from this table that if the four groups be brought into comparison 
with one another as a whole, the engineers have shown the greatest increase (53.3 per 
cent), and now outnumber the lawyers, who, as already shown, have increased less 
rapidly than the population. The groups concerned with religion and welfare and 
with the healing arts have not increased so rapidly as the engineers. They have in- 
creased much more rapidly than the population, however, and still substantially out- 
number the engineers. Notably the group concerned with the various branches of the 
healing arts is numerically much the most important of the four. It is more than 
double its nearest rival. 
In view of the manifold activities in which practising lawyers engage, it is be- 
lieved that this comparison between the four occupational groups as a whole is more 
significant than a comparison between lawyers proper (excluding abstractors, nota-

ries, and justices of the peace), physicians and surgeons proper, clergymen proper, and 
the separate engineering branches. Those who prefer to define the professions, how- 
ever, in terms, not of their general spheres of activity, but of their traditional division 
into more or less adequately organized self-conscious groups, will find in the above 
tables figures suitable for their purposes. 
BAR ADMISSION RULES 
The following are the principal changes that have occurred since the last Annual 
Report, and as late as October 1, 1923.1 
1. General Education 
In the spring of 1921— previous, in other words, to the adoption of the recent 
American Bar Association and Washington Conference resolutions — Kansas re- 
quired applicants for examination in June, 1925, and later, to show, in addition to 
the equivalent of a four-year high school course, the equivalent of two years’ study 
in a general college course. The intention of the State Board of Law Examiners was 
that this general education should be secured prior to the beginning of the three-year 
period of law study. So far as concerns office students, this was ensured by a provi- 
sion under which such students were required to register at the beginning of their 
period of study, and to present at this time proof of the requisite general education. 
Since January, 1922, only students who possess two years of college work, or an edu- 
cation regarded by the Board as equivalent, have been thus registered. Law school 
students, on the other hand, are not required to register. The Board therefore has 
no check upon such students until they come up for their final examination. Since 
the rules do not require, in terms, that such students shall have completed their gen- 
eral education before beginning their period of law study, Washburn College, which 
maintains one of the two local law schools, last year admitted the bulk of its new law 
students to a so-called five-year law course, constituted as follows : For admission, four 
years of high school work was required ; the first three years of the course embraced 
the content of two years of college work and of one year of law work; the last two 
years consisted of law work exclusively. Since these students started their studies in 
good faith, it is probable that when they graduate, in 1927, they will be permitted 
to take the bar examination. In any case, so long as the Board permitted a local law 
school to be conducted on this plan, it seemed impossible last year to list this state 
among those that insist that applicants must secure the required amount of general 
education before beginning their period of law study. 
Beginning with this year, however, Washburn announces only a three-year law 
‘ For discussion of the situation in the spring of 1922, see Seventeenth Annual Report (1922), pp. 71-77, 86-90. Changes 
announced by Illinois and Colorado, in October and November, 1923, will be discussed in next year’s Annual Report.

course, for admission to which two years of college work are required. It is still not 
entirely clear whether students from law schools situated outside the state may not 
claim the privilege of taking the bar examination if they can show that they have 
secured the equivalent of two years of college work at any time before they come up 
for examination. The number of such applicants will be small, however, compared 
with the number that enter from local schools or offices. Kansas may now fairly claim 
the distinction of having the highest requirements of general education in the country, 
and of having in this respect led, rather than followed, the action of the American 
Bar Association, as modified by the Washington Conference on Legal Education. 
No other state at present conforms to the standard of general education set by the 
Conference, and the great majority do not call for even a preliminary high school 
education. Only four states have increased their minimum requirements during the 
year. Montana demands the equivalent of two years of college, but not necessarily 
before the beginning of the period of law study. Ohio has greatly stiffened its require- 
ment of a high school education, notably by making it preliminary to the period of 
law study, and by coupling it with a registration provision applicable to all residents 
of the state, wherever they may be prosecuting their legal studies. Pennsylvania has 
long required applicants, before beginning their law studies, either to show, by exami- 
nation, that they have a general education roughly equivalent to that furnished by 
a high school, or to present evidence of having secured an acceptable academic degree. 
Applicants registering on the basis of the preliminary examination, but not degree- 
holders, have been required to show a certain knowledge of Latin. The Latin require- 
ment has now been increased, and must be satisfied by everybody. This is the only 
state that positively requires any knowledge of Latin. Finally, Louisiana has begun 
to require a high school education. 
2. Duration and Location of Law Study 
The American Bar Association and Washington Conference resolutions recom- 
mended, in effect, that the law office, as a substitute for the law school avenue of 
preparation, should be abolished; that in the case of law school students who de- 
vote substantially all of their working time to their studies, the period of law study 
should be three years; and that in the case of law school students who devote only 
part of their working time to their studies, there should be a longer period, “equiva- 
lent in the number of working hours.” 
The recommendation that the law office method of preparation should be abol- 
ished has found no favor. Every state continues to admit to its bar examinations 
applicants who have never been inside a law school; five states continue to insist that 
a minimum portion of the prescribed period must be spent in a law office; and of these 
states one, New Jersey, has now increased this minimum from nine months to twelve. 
A three-year period of study is required in over half the states. Many states 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
48 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
are still satisfied with a shorter period, however, or with no period at all. During the 
past year there has been no improvement in this respect, so far as concerns full-time 
students. 
The last recommendation of the Conference, affecting part-time students, had been 
followed, a year ago, only to the extent that three states demanded four years in 
an evening law school, as against three years in a day law school. Ohio, during the 
year, instituted a requirement of four years of study in the case of students “from a 
law school where the entire time of the student is not devoted to the study of legal 
subjects.” This is a much better definition of the type of institution that should be 
distinguished from the standard three-year, full-time law school, but it can hardly be 
maintained that self-supporting students, in general, have in four years as much time 
available for study as other students have in three. It is indeed most difficult, if not 
impossible, to compute the precise amount by which the course of any evening or 
afternoon law school would have to be extended, in order to be made “equivalent in 
the number of working hours” to [three years of full-time work. Rhode Island has 
adopted a cautiously worded rule to the effect that it will rate certain schools on its 
list as of “fractional standing and efficiency,” and will give credit for periods of study 
therein accordingly. 
Finally, the State of Washington has initiated a somewhat different line of de- 
velopment from that followed elsewhere. A high school education is all that is posi- 
tively required prior to beginning the study of the law. If the applicant has no more 
than this, however, it appears that the period of study required in an approved law 
school (three years in a day school and four years in an evening school) must be 
supplemented by a year in a law office. 
8. Diploma Privilege 
Both the American Bar Association and the Washington Conference condemned 
the privilege enjoyed by graduates of certain law schools, in fifteen states, of secur- 
ing admission to the bar without passing an independently conducted bar examina- 
tion. No state in which this privilege existed abolished it during the year. Texas 
extended it to include both of the two local schools, as well as a short list of schools 
situated in other states. 
The following table summarizes the salient educational features in the bar admis- 
sion rules of the several states, in so far as they affect applicants not already admitted 
to practice in another jurisdiction.

In the field of law schools there has been greater progress than in that of bar ad- 
missions. Under the recently amended Articles of the Association of American Law 
Schools, candidates for the degree, after September 1, 1923, must present for admis- 
sion one year of college work. Fourteen schools that heretofore have admitted high

school graduates to their degree course have accordingly announced a one-year col- 
lege requirement for the coming year;! though in some of these cases it is not clear 
that equivalents will not be accepted, of a character that is not sanctioned by the 
Association rule. Moreover, seven schools that already required one year of college, 
or that required two years of college for graduation but not for admission to regu- 
lar standing, have raised their requirements to a full preliminary two years.* The 
total number of full-time schools that comply with American Bar Association stand- 
ards in this respect (including again several doubtful cases) has in consequence been 
increased to 44 out of a total of 149, or 30 per cent.? Other changes that may be noted 
are the following: The University of Pittsburgh has abolished its combined course 
and now ranks with Harvard, Pennsylvania, and Northwestern as having the highest 
entrance requirements. Stetson University (Florida) has lengthened its full-time course 
from two years to three. Several Ohio schools, following the recent change in bar ad- 
mission rules, have extended their part-time course from three years to four. George 
Washington has lengthened its course for part-time students. Chattanooga no longer 
announces that capable students may cover its three-year course in two years, and has 
accordingly been removed from the diminishing group of two-year schools. Two part- 
time schools have been removed from the list of degree-conferring schools. Of these, 
Webster (Chicago) is a casualty; the school formerly maintained by Birmingham- 
Southern College has been cast adrift by the College, and although it continues to be 
conducted, under the auspices of the Y.M.C. A., seems to grant no degree. Four new 
part-time schools have been added: Jefferson School of Law, Dallas, Texas (opened 
1920); Virginia Union University, Richmond (opened 1922); College of St. Thomas, 
St. Paul, Minnesota; Houston Y.M.C.A., Texas. 
The tables immediately following show, over a period of years, the number of 
schools, actual and relative, within each of the six broad groups into which they may 
be conveniently divided, from the point of view of the time required to secure the 
degree; and likewise the attendance in each of these groups. After this will be found 
a list of schools in operation during the coming academic year, with symbols attached 
showing the variations in this respect in greater detail. Finally a concluding Sum- 
mary shows the manner in which these symbols are combined to produce the groups 
as constituted for this year.

* The University of Denver School of Law, which has now raised its entrance requirements to two college years, 
resembles the University of Pittsburgh School of Law in that the class-room sessions are not held during the regu- 
Jar working hours of the day. In both cases, however, the majority of the students who do not give their entire 
time to the work of the school seem to be engaged in law offices. Both institutions are described in the appended 
list by the symbol A, but are included in the concluding Summary among the group of full-time schools.

The following list of law schools is given in form similar to that employed in suc- 
cessive Annual Reports, beginning with that published in 1920. The conventional 
symbols attached to each school measure roughly the extent of its prima facie com- 
pliance with the three standards, affecting the amount of time devoted by students 
to their work, that have been formulated by the American Bar Association. That is 
to say, the roman numerals show the number of college years that are required for 
admission to regular standing as candidate for a degree, without regard to the im- 
portant complications produced by the admission of special students, etc., or of reg- 
ular students with entrance conditions. An asterisk means that a college degree is 
required for admission. The letter M (morning) denotes that class-room sessions are 
held during the regular working hours of the day, and that therefore students are, or 
may be, required to devote to their studies all of their time not needed for necessary 
recreation; while the letters A and E denote that class-room sessions are held at other 
hours, more generally convenient for self-supporting students. The arabic numerals 
show the duration of the law school course, in academic years or their equivalent. 
When separate divisions are conducted at different hours of the day, the require- 
ments for each are stated in full, separated by commas. If no degree can be secured 
in the part-time division, its requirements are included within parentheses. 
The list is restricted to schools that confer first degrees in law, because of the prac- 
tical impossibility of drawing any other objective line between a “law school” and a 
fleeting “law class” conducted by one or more attorneys.

  62 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
RESTATEMENT OF AMERICAN LAW 
An event of great prospective importance was the organization on February 23, 
1923, in Washington, D. C., of the American Law Institute, by a very large and 
representative assembly of judges, practising lawyers, and law teachers. The object of 
the movement may be briefly stated as follows. At present, in order that judges and 
lawyers may ascertain the existing law in regard to any point, they are obliged to 
take into consideration not merely the constitution, the legislative statutes, and the 
prior judicial decisions of their own state and of the federal government, but also the 
judicial decisions rendered in other states. These decisions are now so abundant, and. 
so confused, that the task of finding all that are applicable to any given case, and of 
reconciling their mutual inconsistencies when found, is all but impossible, when at- 
tempted under the pressure of current legal practice. The American Law Institute 
has assumed the responsibility of gradually clearing up this confusion. It proposes to 
state, in systematic form, for successive branches of the law, the underlying principles 
exemplified in the better decisions. Its aim is not to question the authority of the 
highest court of each state to determine and declare, subject to constitutional and 
legislative provisions, the law that is to be regarded as in force within its own juris- 
diction. By putting into the hands of the courts, however, a reasoned exposition of 
the best prevailing line of decisions in other states, it hopes greatly to. reduce the 
amount of ad hoc research that now devolves upon the judges, and upon the lawyers 
who practise under them. To the extent that the work commends itself to the legal 
profession as well done, it should become possible for the judiciary and bar of each 
state to confine their search for governing principles or precedents to constitutions, 
statutes, their own prior decisions, and the publications of the Institute, and to be 
freed from the obligation of themselves analyzing and criticizing the enormous body 
of judicial decisions that have been handed down in other states. How greatly this 
would lighten their labors can be best appreciated by those who try to extract the 
authoritative law of any jurisdiction from its present manifold sources. 
It is obvious that a reform of this nature, if successfully carried through, will not 
only be of great service to judges and lawyers who are already engaged in practice, 
and through them to the community at large, but will also profoundly affect the work 
of the law schools in which our future judges and practitioners are trained. In this 
connection the following extracts from Training for the Public Profession of the Law 
may be quoted: 
“It may be respectfully suggested to . . . opponents of technical law-reform that 
if they are satisfied with the present condition of American law, the community 
at large is not. Steps taken toward remedying its confusion are not likely to be 
attended with such immediate success as to place a strait-jacket upon the body 
olitic. The danger is rather that unless some action is taken to clarify and sim- 
plify the hodgepodge of moss-grown precedent and popular petulance which 
courts and legislatures have fastened upon us, the people will destroy this ex-
-P-A-G-E-73

isting law entirely,! with all its evil and with all its good, not distinguishing be- 
tween its repellently mysterious shell and the core of justice and of truth that 
lies deeply concealed within it. This necessity for a technical reshaping of the 
law is entirely distinct from the question of what substantial changes are or are 
not also needed in order to bring it into harmony with the conditions under 
which we live to-day. This latter is a question of policy, as to which men will 
always disagree. But it is rather futile to argue for or against substantial changes 
in the law, when few of those affected by the proposed reforms have a clear idea, 
or can secure a clear idea, of what the present situation is. Discussion of new 
law cannot intelligently proceed, so long as existing law is virtually unintelli- 
gible.”? 
“The lengthening of the law school or bar admission period since 1870 has in 
no way kept pace with the growth of the law that has to be mastered. While 
a still further extension of the preparatory period, coupled with specialization 
on the part of the schools, will reduce the tension to some extent, and ulti- 
mately, it is to be hoped, the law itself can be reduced to more general and hence 
more easily mastered terms, it will be many years before any law school faculty 
or any board of bar examiners or court can defend its curriculum as an ideal one. 
All that can be maintained is that it is the best that can be devised under most 
unfavorable conditions.”* 
“The greatest service that case-method schools can render is consciously to en- 
deavor, by a process that under the most favorable conditions must be painfully 
slow, to express American law in such a form that inordinate effort on the part 
of both students and teachers will no longer be required in order to produce the 
unsatisfactory results yielded to-day even by our best law schools.”*

THE STUDY OF DENTAL EDUCATION 
Tue study of dental education in Canada and the United States was inaugurated in 
1921. It was continued throughout the past year and will soon be concluded. We 
have had, from the beginning, the cordial codperation of each of the dental schools, and 
of each of the national organizations concerned with the promotion of dental educa- 
tion, in this country and in Canada. 
All of the dental schools in Canada and the United States — then fifty-one in 
number — were visited during the academic year 1921-22. At each school detailed 
enquiry was made regarding its condition, aims, needs, and opportunities. Replies to 
enquiries were fully codperative and responsive, almost invariably. The affairs of each 
school, and the scope and relationships of dental education, were discussed sympa- 
As, for instance, by inconsiderately substituting for it a comprehensive and super-simplified code,

  64 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
thetically and constructively with its officers, privately and in nearly every instance 
also at a meeting of its faculty. Suggestions of improvements were always received 
in the spirit of their presentation. This procedure, which was welcomed andencouraged 
by the officers of each dental school, inaugurated and developed general reconsider- 
ation of the problems of dental education, by the whole body of dental teachers. Dis- 
cussion of these problems has been proceeding, with cumulative interest, through- 
out the past year — at the dental schools, and at the meetings of dental societies, 
in all parts of Canada and the United States. As a consequence, a relatively large 
number of dental schools have instituted significant improvements, many of which 
were made during the academic year 1922-23. Important changes are about to go 
into effect. 
Completion of the general report on the study has been delayed somewhat by the 
desirability of continuing the “field work” a little longer than had been planned 
originally, so that the important improvements recently in progress might be studied 
in detail, their general significance noted, and their import stated. Twenty-one dental 
schools were re-visited during the past academic year. Several schools will be visited 
again in October, prior to publication of the general report early in the autumn, 
which will then be closely up-to-date in all its phases. 
When the study was actively begun, in the fall of 1921, fourteen independent den- 
tal schools in the United States were frankly proprietary in character or were con- 
ducted on a plane that was obviously commercial. Of that group of dental schools, 
two have been absorbed by dental schools in universities; one has become a nev in- 
tegral part of a university; three have effected affiliations with universities that are 
expected to be initial steps to organic union; the owners of one are endeavoring ac- 
tively to make the school an integral part of a university; five have been, or are about 
to be, transferred to boards of trustees of independent organizations that were formed 
to conduct the schools as non-proprietary educational institutions (altho the owners 
preferred, and the new organizations desire, to make these schools parts of univer- 
sities); one has been closed ; and only one—a grade-C concern — appears to expect 
to continue as a proprietary school. Accordingly, proprietary dental schools, which 
were important in 1921 as factors of demoralization in dental education, have be- 
come practically extinct. In addition, mercenary or indifferent management of dental 
schools by some universities has been very definitely discouraged and in notable 
instances discontinued. 
The number of independent dental schools in the United States has dwindled, since 
1921, from fourteen to seven, of which, as has just been indicated, only one continues 
to be proprietary. Of the total number of dental schools now existing in the United 
States (43), thirty-four are parts of universities and two are parts of associations of 
professional schools. Of the total number in the latter two groups (36), thirty-three 
are parts of institutions that contain undergraduate schools of medicine, with which 
the dental schools are, or could be, effectively coérdinated. The five Canadian dental  
-P-A-G-E-75
THE STUDY OF DENTAL EDUCATION 65 
schools are parts of, or are closely affiliated with, universities, each of which has a 
school of medicine. 
The discussions that were initiated and maintained by the manner in which the 
study has been conducted, have also encouraged notable further general improve- 
ment in the quality of dental education. In the fall of 1921 only twenty of the fifty- 
one dental schools then existing in Canada and the United States required at least 
one year of college work for admission to the first-year class. Of that number, eighteen 
required it for the first time in 1921. Now, more than half the whole number of dental 
schools in Canada and the United States base the study of dentistry on an entrance 
requirement of at least one year of college work. By 1926, judging from numerous 
preliminary announcements, practically all the schools of dentistry will require at 
least one year of college work for admission, and ten or more will require at least 
two years of preliminary education of college grade. Montreal and Rochester Uni- 
versities have announced a requirement of three years of college work for admission 
to the study of dentistry, beginning in 1925. Montreal will require four years, be- 
ginning in 1927. 
Prior to the inauguration of the study, the dental schools in the United States had 
been organized in two general groups—the National Association of Dental Facul- 
ties and the Dental Faculties Association of American Universities. These two As- 
sociations, which were conducted in the main by the administrative officers of the 
dental schools, met annually and independently. In addition, teachers from all the 
dental schools in Canada and the United States, including the administrative officers 
that conducted the two independent organizations of “dental faculties” in this coun- 
try, and the one in Canada, met annually as delegates to the American Institute of 
Dental Teachers—an international association for the advancement of teaching in 
dentistry. This anomalous situation was complicated, further, by the organization, 
early in 1921, of an “Administrative Council” within the latter body. It was hoped 
by some that this Administrative Council would replace (by absorption) the two 
“associations of dental faculties” in this country; by others it was believed that the 
Administrative Council would also eliminate (by disbandment) the Dental Educa- 
tional Council of America. Disunion, disharmony, and disgust, in consequence of 
these discodrdinations, stood in the way of deliberation, decision, and development. 
It seemed, early in the progress of the study, that consolidation of all these or- 
ganizations, including the Canadian Dental Faculties Association, would be a matter 
of prime importance for the promotion of dental education in North America. The 
idea of such a union was presented and explained frequently, and it was thoroughly 
and informally discussed widely, as we proceeded with the study. The proposal re- 
ceived unanimous approval. Last January the four national organizations named 
above, by unanimous vote of their representatives, in session at Omaha, discontinued 
their individual existences, by complete amalgamation into a new international body 
—the American Association of Dental Schools—which will hold its first meeting in 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  66 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
Cleveland in September. The objects of this Association are stated in its constitution 
as follows: “The American Association of Dental Schools has been established to 
facilitate intercourse and conference among teachers of the dental sciences and arts 
in North America; to promote advancement of teaching and research in American 
schools of dentistry; to encourage thorough study and discussion of the needs and 
problems of dental education; to improve public understanding and appreciation of 
the quality and value of dentistry; and to maintain dental education in full accord 
with the highest requirements of professional education in the public service.” 
The Dental Educational Council of America has been an important supervisory 
body in dental education. It has twenty-four members, eight of whom represent the 
associated dental practitioners; eight, the associated dental examiners (for license to 
practise dentistry), and eight, the associated dental teachers (dental schools). The 
Council has been classifying the dental schools in this country since 1916, and has 
published several revisions of its classification. The last revision since 1921 was an- 
nounced on July 1, 1923. By courtesy of the Council we have been privileged to attend 
all its meetings since 1921, to note all the details of its procedure, and to study its 
official records. During the past year the Council held continuous sessions in October, 
December, and May, lasting, respectively, six, five, and four days, in very earnest at- 
tention to the duties entrusted to it by the leading organizations of dentists and 
dental teachers. 
The most important general actions of the Dental Educational Council during the 
past year, in addition to its re-classification of the dental schools in the United States, 
were (a) publication of a revision of the “minimum requirements” for its Class-A 
rating, including one year of college work as a prerequisite for admission to the first- 
year class in 1926 and thereafter; (b) denial of its Class-A rating to all proprietary 
dental schools as such; and (c) adoption of a “ point system ” of rating dental schools, 
by which the Council’s ratings can be determined with a high degree of accuracy in 
terms of criteria clearly and definitely agreed upon from time to time— and known 
in detail (hereafter) to all the schools to be classified by the Council. 
Unexpected difficulty was encountered in the effort to obtain accurate copies of the 
current dental laws of each of the provinces and states of Canada and the United 
States. Meanwhile, many of these dental laws have been amended. Copies of the laws 
as lately amended are now available for early publication collectively, as had been 
planned. 
The study has indicated that the primary need in dental education as a system, 
at the present stage of its evolution, is its early placement on a basis of scholastic 
equality with medicine, both in the character of the preliminary study required and 
in the depth and breadth of the scientific foundation afforded. Dentists and physi- 
cians should be able to codperate intimately and effectively — they should stand on 
a plane of intellectual equality and should be able to “ talk the same language.” The 
dentist should obviously be educated to study his problems with a medical mind and

be trained to perform his special service with medical understanding. Heshould beequal 
to the physician in the quality of his service as a guardian of the health of individuals 
and of communities. His localized oral service should be rendered with full compre- 
hension of the general relation of that service to the welfare of the body as a whole 
as well as to the bodily parts directly involved or immediately adjacent. He should 
comprehend the meaning of the oral signs of systemic disease and should give ad- 
visory health service accordingly. 
The practice of medicine and the practice of dentistry are codrdinate divisions of 
health service. They are like trees that have sprouted spontaneously from an old stump, 
the stump having long since disappeared —trees alike in kind and closely similar in 
appearance, growing somewhat divergently from the same roots in a common soil, 
through the same air of freedom and individual opportunity, in the same light, 
toward the sky. 
Dentistry can no longer be accepted as mere tooth technology. Its function has 
risen to the dignity and importance of scientific health service. The developments of 
medical knowledge in general, and of dental science in particular, have made it 
obvious that the dentist should have the capacity of a physician in all the require- 
ments of successful prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and cure of disease, as well as 
the skill and efficiency of the surgeon in the mechanical arts of adjustment, removal, 
restoration, and substitution. Trained technicians and assistants will always be needed 
for useful empirical servicein codperation with dentists, physicians, and sanitarians, and 
for the performance of the simpler mechanical tasks of dental art. If and when the 
supply of such assistants falls below the demand for them, the need can be appro- 
priately met. What humanity now requires most of all, of “dental education,” is an 
increasingly larger number of men and women who will practise and develop dentistry 
with the advantages of a broad preliminary education; with knowledge acquired 
on a solid foundation of study of the medical sciences; and with the capacity and 
skill derived from a thorough practical training in the arts of diagnosis, prevention, 
cure, and treatment of dental and oral disorders, with due regard for their systemic 
sequellae. There is a growing need, in short, for dentists who will be not only “ dental 
surgeons,” but also dental physicians and dental sanitarians. 
There have been numerous indications of desire for extensions of the study to the 
dental schools in South America, Europe, and the Orient.

THE TEACHER’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR EDUCATIONAL 
INTEGRITY 
Tue Ristne Cost or Epucation 
Tuere was included in last year’s report of the Carnegie Foundation a section under 
the caption given above. The paper has aroused much discussion among those con- 
cerned with education, not only among teachers and superintendents, but also among 
those who support education through taxation and among parents who are primarily 
interested in the quality, rather than the cost, of education. 
Some of the criticisms of the paper have involved certain misapprehensions. They 
have been based upon the assumption that the paper was intended as an argument 
against the burden of a progressive cost of public education. A careful reading of the 
paper itself will make clear that this criticism is not justified. The paper called atten- 
tion to the rapid rise in educational costs in the last decades, but it plainly set forth 
the fact that a progressive increase in the cost of education was both necessary and 
right. The matter upon which it laid stress was educational, rather than financial. 
It raised the question whether the rise in the cost of education was justifying itself 
by the results of that education as shown in the training of the pupils of the various 
branches of our educational system. The increasing cost of education and the ability of 
the public to pay for it were discussed only to make clear the importanceof making sure 
that the vast sums expended for this purpose produce benefits of corresponding value 
for the children and youth of the nation. That the value to the community of a proper 
system of public education can hardly be measured in dollars and cents, all will agree. 
Whether our present system, however, as now developing, is one that the public ought 
to be called upon blindly to support, is a question that well merits examination. 
The discussion has emphasized the need for thorough studies in educational finan- 
cing. We need to know how a given educational unit—let us say a state—raises the 
money to support its schools. We need to know what relation this has to the whole 
burden of taxation which the state is called upon to carry, and how far this load is 
distributed over the state and its communities. This whole matter of educational 
finance, which has hitherto been very much in the air, is now being taken up from the 
standpoint of careful research, and we may confidently hope that within a reasonable 
time information will be forthcoming upon which a sound educational budget in any 
given community can be based. 
It is clear from such studies as have already been made touching the cost of educa- 
tion that some difference of opinion is likely to be expressed as to what proportion of 
the income of a state, of a county, or of a city may reasonably be devoted to public 
education. 
It is clear also that any discussion of an educational budget must take into account 
the other obligations of the community. It will be found in any state or community 
budget that the margin of income upon which school expenditures must be based is 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  72 THE TEACHER’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
not a direct function of the gross income, but rather a function of the income that 
remains after certain fixed charges have been paid. President Harding, in presenting 
his report for a national budget, pointed out very clearly how difficult had been the 
process of reducing expenses for the reason that the great bulk of the income of the 
government was pledged to certain fixed charges. Thus the interest on the public debt 
must be paid before any economies or new applications of the income could be made. 
As matters stand in the civilized world to-day, assuming that those who work with 
their hands and with their brains receive a living wage for an honest day’s work; and 
assuming also that there is a reasonable return in the way of interest to capital and 
in the way of salary to management, the primary needs of mankind— food, clothing, 
shelter, heat, and transportation—absorb the great bulk of the world’s income. The 
measure of what a people can do in support of education is dependent, not upon the 
gross income of the nation, but upon the residue available after the primary needs 
of humanity have been met. The portion of income taken by taxation has been enor- 
mously increased in the last decade. To-day not only are the needs of education, of 
philanthropy, and of public charity hampered by this increase, but the industrial 
needs for investment are also feeling the serious burden of growing taxation. What, 
therefore, those who have to do with public education must consider, so far as the 
financial situation is concerned, is not the gross income of the country, but the in- 
come that remains after the primary wants of mankind have been met, and the heavy 
taxes to meet governmental fixed costs have been taken out. It is essential that those 
having to do with the support of education shall keep these considerations in mind. 
The popular argument, that the cost of education need cause little apprehension 
so long as the American people expend enormous sums upon luxuries and pleasures, is 
one that has a certain attractiveness, but that leaves out of account fundamental facts 
of human nature. If our social order should advance to such a point that men volun- 
tarily deprive themselves of luxuries and of unwise pleasures, humanity will have been 
so remade that the school system will have been remade with it. It would be magnifi- 
cent if all Americans could be persuaded to give up unwise luxuries and pleasures 
and devote the sums thus expended to education. The difficulty in the process is that 
each of us is ready to give up the indulgences to which he is not devoted, but finds it 
difficult, if not impossible, to surrender his own pet luxuries. It will be recalled, per- 
haps, that some years ago a distinguished scholar published a paper setting forth in 
statistics the sums expended annually by the American people upon drink, tobacco, 
chewing-gum, and jewelry. A plea was made for the reduction of these unnecessary 
expenses for the benefit of the whole cause of public advancement. Unfortunately, it 
was found that even in academic gatherings each man held fast to his own luxury. 
Many a man found it easy to surrender chewing-gum and jewelry who could not bring 
himself to abstain permanently from rum and tobacco. The argument, that educa- 
tional cost can be justified by the extravagances of mankind in the way of luxuries 
and of pleasure, has no sound basis.  
-P-A-G-E-83
  OUR EDUCATIONAL INTEGRITY 73 
In some measure the growing cost of public education is analogous to the rapidly 
mounting expenditure of the American people upon luxuries and pleasures. The cost 
of education in the last three decades represents not only the increases due to the 
growing number of students and the increase in the maintenance costs, but a very 
considerable proportion represents the increase in the number of subjects and activi- 
ties. These do not represent, in all cases, the mature judgment of the teachers of the 
country as to what is wise and necessary. Many men and many groups of men have 
had their particular educational notions carried out in the addition of this or that 
subject or activity to the school program. The present-day expenditures in public 
education represent, in some cases at least, the luxuries of education as well as the 
sober judgment of what constitutes a fair opportunity of training for the American 
child. There may not be any tobacco or rum in these educational luxuries, but there 
is certainly some chewing-gum and jewelry. The essential thing is, in the case of any 
educational unit,—a state, a county, or a city, —to make a careful research into the 
nature of its fixed obligations, and to determine, in view of its great importance, the 
proportion that such state or community can give and ought to give for the edu- 
cation of its children, always keeping in mind the fact that no other expenditure is 
more important for the community than that of a sincere, intelligent, fruitful school 
system. 
Wuar 1s Epucation? 
Assuming that the impending financial scrutiny provides an occasion for a reéx- 
amination of our educational system to the end that the public system of education, 
including both tax-supported and endowed schools, may serve the true interests of 
the youth of the country and therefore of the country itself, I venture to call atten- 
tion again to the specific propositions advanced in the last report of the Carnegie 
Foundation. 
1. The total cost of public education has grown rapidly in the last two decades, 
and many communities, in view of the rapid rise in taxation, will find increasing dif- 
ficulty in meeting this cost if it is to rise at a corresponding rate in the future. 
2. The increase in the cost of education has come about not only through the 
growth of population and the corresponding increase in the number of students, but 
it has arisen in large measure by the addition to the curriculum of a great: number 
of subjects and activities. The high school course of twenty years ago, for example, 
was of a simple cultural type. It now includes somewhere everything from typewrit- 
ing to journalism. 
8. The outcome of this process of expansion has been, not merely to add many new 
facilities, but to transform our conception of what the school can accomplish in be- 
half of civilization. In the process the disciplinary side of education has been almost 
lost, and the education offered in the school has become soft.
-P-A-G-E-84
  74 THE TEACHER’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
4, The great rush of numbers into our schools has been due to many causes, but 
in no small measure to an unsatisfied vocational impulse. The kind of vocational 
training, however, that the bulk of these young people need is not that given in the 
high school, but a sharp technical training such as would be given in a trade school. 
5. The process of expansion has resulted in a regrettable dilution in the scale of 
pay of the teacher. The pay of the teacher in the tax-supported school can be on a fair 
scale only when the school accepts a definite field of activity within which it will do its 
work. 
These were the real questions with which the section of the report of the Foun- 
dation entitled The Rising Cost of Education undertook to deal. 'They are all directly 
related to the question of cost; but they are essentially questions of educational sin- 
cerity and thoroughness. In my judgment, the interests of the country and of the 
teacher alike will be met by facing these questions fairly, frankly, and in good temper. 
The essential qualities of a liberal education for a democracy have been nowhere 
better stated than by Dr. Arthur T. Hadley, in his Economic Problems of Democracy, 
in the following words: 
“We must make provision for giving the voters as a body the elements of a lib- 
eral education in the true sense of the word—an education which fits them for 
the exercise of liberty, civil and political. 
“This true meaning of a liberal education is so often misunderstood that it 
will perhaps come as a surprise to some of us to be reminded of it. In contrasting 
the liberally educated man with the technically educated man, we think of the 
former as having acquired knowledge and interest in many lines, while the latter 
confines his knowledge and interest to the few which bear on his profession or 
trade. But those who take this view miss the essential points and purposes in- 
volved. To begin with, education is not, except to a limited extent, an acquiring 
of knowledge. It is essentially a training of habits and powers. A good deal of 
knowledge is incidentally acquired in the course of this training; but such know- 
ledge is an incident of the education, not its essential instrument or essential 
object. The difference between bad and good ideals of education may be summed 
up by saying that bad education teaches us to know, while good education teaches 
us to know how—how to find things, to judge things, and above all to do things. 
Technical education trains a man to find and judge and do what is necessary in 
his calling; liberal education trains him tofind and judge and dowhat is necessary 
in the exercise of his liberty as a citizen. 
“The founders of the American commonwealth understood the importance of 
this sort of liberal education, and the necessity that every one of its members 
should have some of it in order to be trusted with rights of self-government and 
a share in the government of the community. One of their very first cares was to 
provide a system of public education under which every child should learn read- 
ing, writing, and arithmetic. This education did not go very far, but it went 
straight toward the mark. It put in the hands of American children powers that 
would enable them to take intelligent part in public business when they grew up. 
It did not undertake to give much knowledge of politics or economics; it left 
that to be acquired afterwards, in the jury box or the political campaign, from
-P-A-G-E-85

the newspaper or the counting room. For this, it taught them to rely on them- 
selves. 
“The elementary schools developed under the influence of these ideas and pur- 
poses have continued down to the present day to be the most satisfactory part 
of the American public school system. Speaking broadly, they have given every 
boy his chance, and have made patriotic Americans out of nineteen-twentieths 
of the material that came into their hands, even though some of it was very 
unpromising. Our public high schools are for the most part of later origin and 
have had a wider aim; but they have not been equally successful in attaining it. 
They have tried to give the boys and girls who attended them many kinds of 
knowledge and training which would be interesting to them in school and useful 
in after life; but they have suffered in their efforts from two disadvantages, which 
in the state of public feeling at the middle of the last century were almost un- 
avoidable. The first was the over-valuation of mere knowledge as compared with 
training; almost every parent wanted his boys taught facts on the subjects in 
which he himself was most interested, and was impatient of any educational sys- 
tem which left him ignorant of these facts. The second was the belief encouraged 
by Herbert Spencer that studies ought to be naturally interesting to the pupil, 
and the idea, for which it is not fair to hold Spencer responsible, that it was the 
duty of the teacher to make them so if they were not. Pupils trained under these 
influences in school or college—for our colleges were not exempt from these 
adverse influences—gained knowledge rather than power, breadth rather than 
accuracy or efficiency, habits of dependence rather than habits of self-reliance. 
“It is this last point which shows the gravest defect of the system from a politi- 
cal standpoint. If breadth is purchased at the expense of self-reliance, the edu- 
cation is an illiberal one—an actual detriment to the exercise of civil liberty. 
The boy who has become accustomed to depend on the teacher for his knowledge 
in school tends to take his knowledge at second hand in after life. The boy who 
can study only what he likes in school is governed in after life by his likes and 
dislikes rather than by his reason.” 
I believe profoundly that in time we, as a people, will be able so to adjust our edu- 
cational system as to correct whatever inequalities may have arisen by reason of the 
rapid growth of the last twenty years. The attention of our teachers has been directed 
during that period toward a policy of expansion. The time has now come when their 
thought and study must be given to the critical examination of the field already 
covered, to the elimination of those things that ought not to be retained, and to the 
codrdination of all our efforts toward the development of a school system whose func- 
tion and whose aim is clearly related to the needs of a democracy. Only by this 
process can the interests of all the people be preserved. 
The relation of the present widespread curriculum to the true function of the school 
as an intellectual agency is tersely put, by one whose life has been spent in public 
education, in the following words: 
“The elementary curriculum has expanded in recent years into a huge collec- 
tion of knowledge and of activities. Nearly all the subjects suitable for children, 
and some others, have been gathered from all sources until both teachers and
-P-A-G-E-86
  76 THE TEACHER’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
children are overloaded with these bountiful gifts. At present they are stagger- 
ing under the load. 
“The last thirty years has been a period of almost reckless expansion of 
common-school studies into all the new and old realms of experience. It 
may require the next thirty years to sift out and organize these accumulated 
treasures.” 
Professor McMurry, in this brief paragraph, touches a point which is very com- 
monly raised by those who have been responsible in large measure for the enormous 
expansion of school subjects. Discussing the question of fiscal responsibility, “If it is 
proposed,” say these gentlemen, “that we expend less upon public education, what 
part of our modern program is to be omitted? Shall we, for example,” say they, “omit 
music and art and drawing and household and industrial arts, and other new subjects 
of the modern elementary school curriculum?” The question might include many 
other studies which have been added to the curriculum in some schools— dancing, 
typewriting, journalism, advertising, and other subjects, all good in themselves. 
This objection must be met and met fairly and the answer is perfectly straight- 
forward. 
Almost every study of human relations, of human industry, and of human learn- 
ing can be made fruitful if well taught. Furthermore, it is desirable that a child or 
a youth should have as generous a knowledge as is possible of the great forces and 
activities of the world, But it is humanly impossible to include in a school curricu- 
lum all the interesting subjects that touch human life. When the attempt is made 
to do so, a new conception of education is accepted. It is conceived of no longer as 
grounded on a thorough training in a few subjects until the child has gained the 
power to turn his mind to one problem or another as they may be presented, but rests 
upon the assumption that a little knowledge of many things is the beginning of wis- 
dom. Between a curriculum that is rigid and narrow and a curriculum that consists 
of a miscellaneous hodge-podge of subjects, there is a middle path along which edu- 
cation may develop, one that gives to the individual child a reasonable opportunity 
for cultural development, but that does not give him intellectual dyspepsia by placing 
before him so great a variety of subjects that he is bewildered by the richness of the 
feast. There is a great list of subjects, any one of which furnishes a wide opportunity 
for culture combined with thoroughness and intellectual discipline. The great re- 
sponsibility of the teaching profession is to select from among these a suitable pro- 
gram, and not to seek to include in the studies and the activities of the school every 
subject of human interest. 
The multiplicity of subjects in our school program has arisen, not so much out of 
the common judgment of the teaching profession, as out of the effort to meet the 
personal views of a great number of men, among whom there is no real agreement. 
Certain fundamental studies have been found to be more fruitful than are others in 
1 Preface to Professor Charles A. McMurry’s recent book, How to Organize the Curriculum.
-P-A-G-E-87
OUR EDUCATIONAL INTEGRITY 17 
the development of the intellectual powers of the child or youth. A knowledge of 
the mother-tongue, elementary mathematics, drawing, a study of the government of 
one’s own country, would probably be included in any course of study proposed by 
any teachers. But it is impossible to graft on this simple basis all the things which 
interest some twentieth century teachers or might interest many twentieth century 
children. This is not the function of the school. When it is attempted, the result 
is very like the physical upset that one gets from a dinner with too many highly 
spiced dishes. One may be very sure that the upset which comes to such a diner does 
not arise from the simple roast beef and potatoes that he may have eaten, but from 
the interesting additions. In much the same way the widespread intellectual flab- 
biness with which the minds of school children are affected is not due to the study of 
English, or mathematics, or drawing. It arises from the number and variety of dishes 
that have been added to the school table. 
One of the most difficult tendencies for men to overcome, whether in education, in re- 
ligion, or in politics, is a faith in specifics. We have no educational specifics. The culture 
of the human mind and soul may be advanced by the study of a reasonable group of 
subjects under almost any form of selection. There are some few that are not only of 
great cultural value, but are absolutely essential in civilized life. To these fundamental 
subjects others may properly be added. The notion, however, that the child or the youth 
will be miraculously bettered by any given one of these possible additions to the cur- 
riculum is one of the illusions with which we deceive ourselves. One has only to recall 
the glowing words of Mr. Herbert Spencer as to what would happen to the world when 
psychology was studied in every school. The weak point in his prognostications lay 
in the fact which he left out of consideration,— the psychology of the psychologists 
themselves! 
Tue Scuoor as an AGENCY oF CIVvILIzaTION 
Next to government, the school is perhaps the oldest agency of civilization that 
survives to-day in approximately its earliest form. The earliest schools of which we 
have any complete description were those of Greece, and they served in greater or 
less measure as the pattern of all later schools. In the time of Socrates there were in 
Athens professional teachers of three kinds—the grammarians, who taught reading, 
writing, and perhaps arithmetic and geometry; the teachers of music, from whom the 
boys learned playing and singing; and the teachers of gymnastics, who taught wrest- 
ling, boxing, the throwing of the javelin, and other athletic exercises. To these teach- 
ers, boys were conducted daily by the pedagogues (boy-leaders), who were slaves. The 
boys were taught singly and not in groups, and all boys did not go through all schools. 
Socrates, for example, when he was grown, attended a school to learn music because 
he thought his education demanded it. The whole quality and value of the school 
centred in the teacher. The teacher made the school. The contact with him was that 
which gave value to attendance upon the school.
-P-A-G-E-88
    78 THE TEACHER’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
Throughout the civilized world of the Mediterranean there grew up schools which 
consisted of groups of pupils gathered about a master. The topics that the master 
taught varied with the religious and cultural notions of the inhabitants of the various 
Mediterranean countries. Even in remote regions the schoolmaster became a factor 
in the community life. In Palestine, for example, in the time of Christ, the schools 
maintained by the rabbis were mainly devoted to the study of the Hebrew scrip- 
tures, but they also touched, in greater or less degree, the philosophy of Greece. The 
school was held sometimes in the house of the rabbi, sometimes in a corner of the 
Synagogue or in a nook of the wall of the Temple. Such a school undoubtedly Christ 
Himself attended. And there He acquired that familiarity with the sacred writings 
of the Jews which He exhibited throughout the years of His teaching. He spoke, of 
course, Aramaic, but He learned, no doubt, to read Hebrew, and probably had some 
knowledge of Greek. 
With the developing complexity of civilization, the school tended more and more 
toward a fixed curriculum and toward the task of teaching boys in groups rather than 
singly. The Roman schools, for example, were very like the modern schools. They were 
organized ; the curriculum included, besides grammar, rhetoric, and elementary math- 
ematics, certain foreign languages, and an extensive reading of the poets and of 
literature. Studies were compulsory, and all the methods of discipline used in modern 
schools were applied in the effort to induce boys to learn that which they had no 
particular interest in putting into their heads. In the Roman days, as now, there were 
well-founded complaints that the teachers were ill paid. 
During the Middle Ages the schools remained very much what they were in the 
later days of Rome. A school gathered about a teacher or a group of teachers. The 
great masses of students who gathered in the medieval universities came to hear one or 
another great teacher. The inspiration and the genius of the teacher made the foun- 
dation upon which the value of the school was predicated, and altho the habit grew 
of lecturing to students in mass, nevertheless it still remained true that that which 
brought students together and that which made a school famous was the quality of 
the teacher. 
Through all this period the social ideals of most civilized countries looked upon 
the school as a method of preparation for the exceptional boy—the boy of noble 
birth, or of a cultivated and wealthy family, or of unusual mental attainments. The 
school was democratic in the sense that it accepted rich and poor, noble and peasant, 
sometimes even the slave, provided he were a lad of great promise. There was no ex- 
pectation on the part of society that the school would ever become the universal 
agency for the training of human beings. It was the door of opportunity for the ex- 
ceptionally placed or the exceptionally endowed boy, those who would become scholars 
and teachers, priests and rulers and leaders. Inconsistent with our modern conception 
of democracy as this was, it operated to bring into the school the highest type of 
youth that a country produces. But always the notion that lay back of the school
-P-A-G-E-89
  OUR EDUCATIONAL INTEGRITY 719 
and which was its reason for existence was the appreciation of the teaching, of the 
culture, and of the influence of the teacher. 
An immense expansion of the function of the school came with the spread of the 
democracy of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and attained its full expres- 
sion by the middle of the nineteenth. Civilized society had come to look upon the 
school as an agency for the training, not of the few, but of the whole body of chil- 
dren. Universal education was the watchword of the modern world and remains to-day 
the most powerful spring of action among civilized peoples. The conception that the 
school shall be open to all children, rich and poor, clever or dull, was a noble one. 
It arose out of the genuine aspirations of the European peoples for liberty and for 
justice. Its development has had the most profound effect upon the modern world. 
The growth of this idea has entirely transformed the centuries-long conception of 
the school in two respects. 
In the first place, the school is no longer thought of as a group of pupils gathered 
about a master who teaches each pupil according to his personal aptitude and powers. 
In every modern nation it has become a vast mechanism with fixed courses of study. 
The organization, rather than the individual teacher, is the source from which the 
training and improvement of the pupil is sought. 
In the second place, the school organization now undertakes to deal, through a more 
or less formal curriculum, with all sorts and conditions of children and of youth. The 
question of attendance is no longer one of desire on the part of the pupil, ofa capacity 
for education, or of the excellence of the teacher in a particular subject. Instead, there 
has been substituted a process possible only with a far-flung organization, under which 
all the children and all the youth of a nation are educated to a certain point, and as 
many of them as care to continue beyond this point are offered the facilities and 
advantages of what is called higher education. The school has been transformed from 
a personal, direct agency for the few, into a great machine for the many. Much the 
same process has gone on as that by which the individual home industries have been 
transferred to great factories. If all the children of a nation are to be educated, — 
as they certainly should be,—no other plan can be adopted than that of extensive 
organization. The system involves, however, certain inherent dangers which we should 
frankly recognize. To submerge the teacher — his culture, his spirit, and his inspira- 
tion — in the working of the machinery means that only mediocrity is served. Under 
such a situation, some other agency must in time arise for the purpose of cultivating 
the mind and the spirit of children of promise. 
Tue Unseen TRaNsFoRMATION oF Human Instrrvrions 
In the history of civilization it has seldom happened that those who were directly 
concerned in the development of a great cause, whether of religion, of education, or 
of politics, realized how profoundly the fundamental purpose of their cause was modi-

fied by the means adopted for its development and by the organization set up to carry 
it out. The most altruistic and the most spiritual endeavors are transformed by the 
machinery which they use for their advancement. 
Perhaps the most remarkable example of such a transformation is that of the Chris- 
tian Church. For a century and a half it remained a purely evangelical movement, 
whose mission was to preach salvation through Jesus Christ. During the first decades 
of its wonderful history its leaders lived in constant expectation of the second coming 
of their Lord. The movement was filled with the idealism of an intense faith, and it 
spread over the civilized world with amazing rapidity. Its message was simple, direct, 
individual. 
Then two things happened that profoundly modified the whole character and influ- 
ence of what was called Christianity. 
As decade followed decade and the coming of the Redeemer seemed no nearer, the 
Fathers of the Church found themselves more and more under the criticism of the 
Greek and Roman philosophers. They felt the need of combating this with a philoso- 
phy of faith, and through the labors of Origen and Clement and Saint Jerome, and 
more or less through the influence of Philo of Alexandria, in touch both with Hebrew 
theology and with Greek philosophy, there was developed a theology—a, science of 
religion. In time this system of dogma came to bulk larger, in the eyes of those who 
directed the Christian movement, than the fundamental fact of their religion. Chris- 
tianity became theological. Eventually, under Justinian, it was strong enough to close 
the rival School of Philosophers in Athens. 
In the second place, the Church made a convert of a Roman emperor, and through 
this imperial support it grasped the reins of civil government. In a few years it passed 
from contumely to power. More than a thousand years were required to rescue civil 
authority from the grasp of the organization developed to deal with the theological 
and governmental functions that Christianity had assumed. In the long process the 
fundamental purpose for which the Church existed, and its relation to human society, 
had been enormously modified. The simple religion of its Founder had been over- 
laid by influences and forces developed to deal with theological and governmental 
functions. 
The school — if one uses that term in the broad sense, to include our whole edu- 
cational system —has passed through a somewhat similar transformation. It began 
as an agency for the development of the individual. The master and his pupil or the 
master and a group of pupils was the unit. As society became more complex, and as 
the notion of formal education for every human being was accepted, this unitary con- 
ception of education, based upon the intimate touch of master and pupil, could not 
meet the needs of society. Education must be given wholesale. Organization had 
to be resorted to, to deal with a problem so diverse and so enormous. The problem 
with which the school—again using that term in the wide sense—deals to-day is not 
unlike that of the Church. How can one develop the organization necessary for the

quantitative work that must be done and yet preserve the original fundamental pur- 
pose of the school, which is to discipline and train the mind and character of the indi- 
vidual boy or girl? How can we prevent this fundamental conception of education 
from becoming so distorted by the machinery of organization that its essential pur- 
pose is forgot? This, in the present phase of our American educational development, 
is the most important question to answer. 
The history of our educational agencies during the past three decades is the per- 
fectly natural result of efforts to develop in a democracy the means of education for 
the whole body of citizens. As the schools became free from the hard and fixed clas- 
sical curriculum and added new courses of study intended to broaden the oppor- 
tunities of the student and to give him also a wider knowledge of the forces and 
processes of modern civilization, it would have been surprising if the process of ex- 
pansion had not gone too far. It could scarcely have been expected that we should 
altogether hold to the old sincerity of discipline, to the development of the individ- 
ual, and to the primary conception of the school as an intellectual agency, when 
there were such numbers to be taught and an unlimited field of subjects in which 
instruction might be given. The process has been in operation for nearly a genera- 
tion. The result is that organization and quantity have displaced, to a considerable 
extent, the individual contact of a student with a cultivated mind and the apprecia- 
tion of that fundamental truth that in the development of a human soul it is not 
the amount of information absorbed that constitutes education, but the ability to 
think clearly and to bring out the right answer to the problems that present them- 
selves in each human life. We are still disposed to add more organization to our 
machinery and to add fresh subjects to our already extended curriculum as an answer 
to the intellectual call of our day. This is in the same direction of mechanical expan- 
sion to which we have given ourselves during the last three decades. The pressing 
problem before us now is the betterment of our whole school life, and that better- 
ment must come, not from greater quantity, but from a fresh appreciation of the 
culture of the individual mind. 
It isa perfectly fair question for those who have favored this great development 
of school machinery and of a wide-flung curriculum to ask— What is proposed in 
order to bring about a betterment of our educational situation? If there are too many 
studies and too much machinery, what do you propose to substitute in their place? 
It would seem to me that the acceptance of the following propositions would be 
fundamental to any movement looking toward a betterment of the quality of our 
education as compared with its quantity. 
In the first place, we must assume, in a democracy, that every child must have an 
opportunity for a fair start in life, and that the means to that end lie in a whole- 
some elementary school. Along with this, however, we must also recognize the fact 
that a school cannot do everything, and that it will fufil its greatest function if it 
does well that which is its primary duty. The elementary course, therefore, offered 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
    82 THE TEACHER’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
to all students ought to be simple and should recognize both the obligation of in- 
tellectual discipline and of human culture. Few of our schools have compassed these 
two ends as successfully as some European schools. In them the child has a few studies 
that he must learn with thoroughness if he is intellectually able to learn any subject 
thoroughly. There is not a great difference of opinion among men as to what these 
fundamentals are. The child attains his cultural opportunities, not so much through 
the disciplinary work of a formal class, as through the association and contact with 
an inspiring teacher. He will get what knowledge of music he has, or of botany, or 
of art, not through formal recitations, but through contact with a teacher who is 
himself cultivated in the subject he teaches, who brings him in touch with a certain 
amount of good music, or who takes him to the museum, or who leads him into the 
fields to study the flowers. One of the fundamental defects of elementary instruction 
is trying to teach all subjects by the same class-room process. I think no one can 
doubt that the boy who is held up to sharp, exact work in a few fundamental subjects 
and who is allowed to obtain his cultural knowledge by less formal means, not stand- 
ing always in the fear of a mark from his teacher, will gain both in intellectual dis- 
cipline and in cultural appreciation. How much can be done in cultural development 
of elementary students is a matter on which the judgment of men will necessarily 
differ, and in which there is an enormous difference of capacity among pupils. No 
process of formal education can bring all pupils either to a high state of intellectual 
discipline or to the broad enjoyment of cultural subjects. So far as human experience 
goes, the school does its best work when it demands a sharp performance in a few 
subjects, coupled with a cultural opportunity for appreciation in others. 
In any case, the elementary school must limit its field. It cannot do everything, It 
cannot assume that the school is the only educative force in the community. 
In this matter of the function of the elementary school, one who knows the situ- 
ation feels a deep sympathy for the teacher. All discipline of Americans has greatly 
weakened in the last generation. The family discipline of a generation ago is almost 
unknown, and the tendency has been to throw upon the school an increasing respon- 
sibility for the moral, intellectual, and social cultivation of the boy or girl. The 
parents have come to think of the school as primarily responsible for the intelligence 
and character of their children. The school, in spite of itself, has had to accept in large 
measure this situation, and the teachers have struggled patiently and bravely in the 
effort to carry an impossible load. We cannot put on the school the entire responsibil- 
ity for the moral, intellectual, and cultural training of the child. Much of it must be 
done elsewhere—in the family, in the church, in the social contact of human beings 
with one another. The German or the Italian child gets his love of music not from 
formal classes in school. He breathes it in as a part of the cultural atmosphere in 
which he lives. That we can do something to help this appreciation of cultural life 
by the teaching of certain subjects in the school is clear, but that we can turn matter- 
of-fact Americans into lovers of beauty by formal class recitations is a futile hope.
-P-A-G-E-93
  OUR EDUCATIONAL INTEGRITY 83 
It would, therefore, seem to be fundamental that the elementary school should ac- 
cept clearly its own limitations. It should make sure that the teaching which is com- 
mon to all children is done with a sharp discipline of exact requirement, but that 
a very large part of what is meant to be of cultural value shall be through exercises 
not followed by examinations, but having as their spring of influence the contact 
with cultivated and inspiring personalities. 
Under this regime the elementary school curriculum would be greatly simplified. 
In the second place, while we must in a democracy proceed upon the assumption 
that every child is entitled to the fundamentals of an education in the elementary 
school, we must frankly recognize that a large proportion of the children of the na- 
tion have neither the desire nor the intellectual ability to complete the work of a 
secondary school with profit to themselves. In no nation in the world is there a task 
comparable to that of the American teacher in the secondary schools, patiently and 
devotedly toiling to bring through to graduation multitudes of pupils who have 
neither the desire nor the ability for intellectual work. The high school should no 
longer be the refuge for mediocrity that we have made it. 
This involves no discrimination against any class or group in the body politic. The 
stupid or indifferent child is just as likely to be the son of the well-to-do as the son 
of the day laborer. Teachers are coerced by parents, by school directors, by all the 
influences that can be brought to bear, to keep in their classes numbers of students 
whose happiness and usefulness are to be found elsewhere. 
This artificial lure of the high school would be removed in large measure if the high 
school ceased to play the réle of a vocational school. A community, and particularly 
a community of moderate size, is easily made to believe that when its high school 
offers typewriting and commercial courses, and various other vocational subjects, it is 
a practical institution; and we Americans have a weakness for that which calls itself 
practical. 
Many of these courses are illusory. The high school cannot turn itself into a voca- 
tional school without losing in large measure the place that it ought to occupy in 
the general cultural education of the people. A majority of the boys and girls of a 
community cannot go to college. The high school was originally founded to be the 
people’s college. Its purpose was to give to those who took advantage of its courses 
that breadth and thoroughness of education which should enable them to grow 
into positions of usefulness and fruitfulness in a vocation or profession. The attempt 
to make of the secondary school at once a school of general cultural training and a 
vocational school has confused the two purposes. The high school should remain that 
which it was intended to be, and vocational instruction, such as is called for by those 
who desire to enter gainful occupations, should be of the sharp, precise, disciplinary 
sort that can be given only in a trade school. I talked with a high school graduate 
recently who had learned stenography in the high school, but later had found it 
necessary to take a course in typewriting in a commercial school carried on for that 
   
-P-A-G-E-94
  84 THE TEACHER’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
purpose. In answer to the question as to what he was set to work to do first, he said, 
“I was set to work to learn how to spell, and,” said he, “I learned it in three months.” 
The high school would better serve its pupils by teaching them to spell, to read, to 
know good books, to reason in clear fashion, to know the fundamental principles of 
the government under which they live, rather than by trying to teach them typewrit- 
ing and leaving them to learn how to spell later. Whatever one may think of the great 
expansion of the high school curriculum that has taken place in the last two decades, 
one must at least agree that it is now necessary that the high school should define 
what its function is and address itself steadily to the discharge of that function. 
The softness and superficiality that have crept into the elementary school and the 
secondary school affect the colleges and the universities in an equal degree. The col- 
leges, whether they exist as separate institutions or whether they are parts of a com- 
plex university, have also abandoned to a large extent the disciplinary function in 
education. They, too, seek to teach cultural subjects by the method of formal class 
recitation, and they have so allowed those activities of the college that lie outside of 
the curriculum to overshadow the intellectual activities of their institutions that 
scholarship and scholarly appreciation occupy a secondary place. They, like the high 
schools, admit to their classes great numbers of students ill-prepared for college work 
and having little or no interest in study, and keep them there by various processes of 
adventitious aid. 
No group of men in the country are better cognizant of this state of affairs than 
college teachers themselves. In some colleges the faculties have made a gallant stand 
against the progress of intellectual softness and the desire for numbers. There are 
honorable exceptions to the general statement that the conditions of the college do 
not make for vigorous intellectual life. But taking the country over, it is fair to say 
that such effort as has been made by the faculties to maintain high ideals of schol- 
arship and of scholarly life has been more than offset by the intense competition for 
numbers and by the widespread desire of alumni, and oftentimes of trustees, for pre- 
eminence in other activities of the student body, and in particular in athletics. That 
which a college calls its constitueney—which means mainly the body of alumni—is 
more interested in a winning football team than in the presence of an earnest and 
scholarly spirit or of a generous cultural life among the student body. 
The college, like the high school, has spread its offerings over too wide a field. 
Every college seeks to do everything. There is a lack of individuality among the 
colleges of the country with respect to what they teach. With them, as with the high 
school, the question must be fairly faced, whether they shall continue to offer great 
numbers of courses, some of which can be given only under unfavorable circumstances, 
or whether each college shall offer instruction in a field no broader than it can cover 
with sincerity and thoroughness. 
In a general way, therefore, the fundamental concepts that must lie back of any 
movement of our educational system toward sounder conditions would seem to me to
-P-A-G-E-95
OUR EDUCATIONAL INTEGRITY 85 
depend upon a clear comprehension in the first place of what the elementary school, 
the secondary school, and the college can do, not what they would like to do, And 
this does not mean a narrow or a meagre offering of studies. 
The leadership of the college will always be a powerful influence on the secondary 
school. To-day that influence makes rather for an emphasis on artificial standards of 
admission and on the exaltation of competitive athletics rather than for the appreci- 
ation of learning, of skill, or of intellectual sincerity. It has all come about naturally 
enough. It cannot go on indefinitely without profoundly affecting the intellectual and 
cultural quality of our national life. 
Tue RELATION OF THE Pustic ScHoot To THE TRADES AND CRAFTS 
There exists in our country a singular and a decidedly unwholesome situation 
with regard to the skilled crafts, which is directly related to the attempt to give 
vocational training in the public school. The old system of apprenticing, under which 
a boy became a journeyman through service under a master of the trade, has almost 
disappeared. Benjamin Franklin, when he died in 1790, left two sums of money, the 
one in Boston and the other in Philadelphia, to be loaned to apprentices. By the mid- 
dle of the nineteenth century, it was impossible to find enough apprentices to take 
up the loans that the two funds had to offer. 
For many years past, our supply of skilled labor has been in large measure drawn 
from England and the continent of Europe. Under the present immigration laws, 
however, this supply is so greatly diminished as to afford no longer any large number 
of skilled craftsmen. Our immigration laws do not allow, as do those of Canada, a 
selection of immigration on the basis of trade qualifications. 
This situation has come about through a number of causes, among which must be 
set down the general neglect of employers, on the one side, to look out for the train- 
ing of apprentices, and the unwise restrictions, on the other side, imposed by the 
labor unions. A boy may not enter most of the trades to-day until he is long past 
the time when his apprenticeship ought to begin, and even then his difficulties in 
getting into certain trades, by reason of the union restrictions, are far greater than 
most people realize. We have not yet approached the situation that obtained in 
France before the outbreak of the Revolution, when the trade guilds, corresponding 
to our trade unions, had become so autocratic as not only to control the amount of 
production but to limit so sharply the acceptance of an apprentice that the regime 
set up by the guilds had become an intolerable tyranny. When the General Assembly 
framed the first constitution, it was directed mainly at three privileged classes—the 
trade guilds, the nobility, and the clergy. 
To-day in the United States both the employers of labor and the wiser labor 
leaders realize that restriction of apprenticeship has gone too far, even when consid- 
ered from the standpoint of the unions themselves. The prohibition against the ac- 
   
-P-A-G-E-96
86 THE TEACHER’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
ceptance of an apprentice until the age of eighteen is most unjust to the youth of a 
country. The great mass of boys leave school at fourteen. There is no more pathetic 
situation in education than the aimless, haphazard experience which a large number 
of boys between the ages of fourteen and eighteen undergo in the United States. It 
is a hardship both on the boys and on the public. Looked at in its true light, it is 
no less fatal to the unions themselves, as all selfish measures turn out, in the end, to 
be. Never, in the history of the world, has the artificial attempt to limit production 
and to make out of the trades a privileged class succeeded. In the long run, it has 
brought down upon those who have attempted it the severest condemnation of soci- 
ety. There are many signs to-day that both employers of labor and the labor unions 
themselves will adopt a more humane and reasonable attitude toward the training 
of apprentices for the skilled trades. 
The preparation of a youth for the skilled trades can be helped by a preliminary 
training in a well-conducted trade school. He will not become a journeyman in the 
trade school, any more than the student of engineering becomes an engineer in the 
engineering school, but he will learn the underlying theory of his trade, the science 
that directly relates to it, and if the school is rightly conducted, he will get the sharp 
sense of accuracy and responsibility which alone can make a good journeyman and the 
possession of which gives the skilled workman that joy in his craft which is one of the 
most enduring satisfactions that a human being can attain. The numberof such schools 
is likely to increase, and we may well hope that the labor unions will have the wisdom 
and the sense of responsibility for their own youth which may prompt them to develop 
again that craftsmanship which meant so much to our country a generation ago. 
In this situation, vocational training in the public schools has played a poor réle. 
These vocational efforts have been directed chiefly toward vocations other than 
the skilled crafts. The sort of vocational training that the boy gets in the public 
school turns him to typewriting, or to a minor place in a bank, or to a clerkship, or 
to salesmanship, or to some other calling which does not involve hard manual work 
and severe and exact skill. It is a singular part of the psychology of the situation 
that, while the graduate of the engineering school is perfectly ready to put on overalls 
and work in the grease and the dirt, the graduate of the high school expects to sit at 
a desk, or to run a typewriter, or to sell bonds, or to become a clerk in a bank. If he 
be the son of a journeyman in the trades, he is quite ready to accept a scale of pay 
in these places that scarcely yields him more in a month than his father receives in 
a week at present-day wages. The education of the public school has drawn pupils 
away from the productive work of the highly skilled and exact trades. Not only is the 
atmosphere of the school unfavorable to the development of such an ambition, but 
the kind of work that is given as vocational work is unrelated, both in spirit and in 
detail, to the sharp, careful training which fits a man for a craft or a trade. The re- 
sult is that the high school vocational courses minister largely to vocations that may 
be useful enough in themselves, but which have little significance in the productive
-P-A-G-E-97
  OUR EDUCATIONAL INTEGRITY 87 
work of the world. One regrettable fact about the whole process is that the propa- 
ganda for high school and college leads to desks and typewriters an army of youth 
who would be far happier in a productive craft if only they had found the path to it. 
How many farmers, machinists, carpenters, electricians, plumbers, or cooks have come 
out of all these courses? 
A clear distinction is to be made between the vocational courses;attempted in the 
regular school curriculum and the instruction given in continuation courses for the 
benefit of those already at work and earning a living, such, for example,as those offered 
to enlisted men in the army and navy. Continuation courses have great value for men 
in the skilled trades and in other vocations, and the more so because appeal is here 
made to the man or woman who has the energy and the ambition for self-improvement. 
Here, however, as in the high school, the temptation is always present to try to impart 
that technical skill and facility that can be acquired only in contact with practice. 
The continuation school does its best service for the man who seeks to better his know- 
ledge and skill in his vocation by giving him the opportunity to ground himself in 
those fundamental studies that the school can give well, not by attempting to offer 
technical training which it can give but poorly. The ambitious man in the trades— 
the carpenter, the machinist, the plumber— does not need the continuation school to 
teach him the technique of his trade. What he asks of that school is English, mathe- 
matics, elementary chemistry and physics, a knowledge of which enables him to under- 
stand the theory of his trade and to advance in it. A training in the fundamental 
sciences underlying his vocation is what such a man needs, and this the school can do 
well and without increasing its plant and equipment. The technique of the trade it 
cannot teach, 
The public school makes its greatest contribution to training in the crafts when 
it teaches boys and girls in the elementary school to do such work there as will give 
them the discipline of mind and the accuracy of knowledge necessary to enter a skilled 
craft. The greatest service the elementary school can do for the boy who wants to be 
a carpenter, or a mason, or a machinist, or an electrician, or a printer, or a glazier 
will not be accomplished by trying to teach him something about any of these skilled 
trades. It will do the greatest possible service for him if it sees to it that he knows 
the English language well, that he can reason in terms of his elementary mathe- 
matics with sharpness and accuracy, that he understands the fundamental principles 
upon which his government rests, and that he has acquired in the process of his ele- 
mentary education that thoroughness of knowledge in these simple subjects and that 
ability to turn his mind to one problem or another which will qualify him to go into 
a trade school and to do its work so well that the trade school will not have to teach 
him English and elementary mathematics. With the best intentions on the part of 
those who originated these courses, the introduction of vocational training into the 
high school has in a considerable measure served only to lead men away from those 
high and honorable vocations which find expression in a sincere and accurate crafts-

It is always easier to expand than to reduce. It will be difficult to carry out the 
process which Professor McMurry describes as “sifting out and organizing the trea- 
sures of the common school studies, accumulated in the last thirty years” of what 
he calls “reckless expansion.” The main thing is that we turn our thought to-day in 
that direction, that we steadily have in view the necessary limitations as to what a 
school can do, and that we keep clear at each step the fact that the school serves its 
purpose best when it does certain things thoroughly and sincerely, not when it does 
many things superficially and insincerely. Such an attitude will sift out the long list 
of studies, but it will do something more important. It will bring a perspective as to 
the results of school training and a test of what the school does, not as drawn from 
hopeful and ambitious programs of study, but as demonstrated in the actual training 
of the minds of students. 
“What will you drop from the present curriculum?” is the common enquiry. 
“Would you drop music or household economics?” 
Perhaps these two topics, the one cultural and the other believed to have both 
cultural and practical value, may well serve as illustrations of the kind of process 
through which we must go. 
The first step in the effort to answer this enquiry would be to ask— How much 
does the teaching of music mean to-day in the school, and how much does the teach- 
ing of household economics mean in the life and fitness and usefulness of those who 
are taught? 
One would be slow to discourage any effort of a cultural value among the school 
population of the United States. We, as a nation, are so little cognizant of the influ- 
ences of the arts and so little prepared for their enjoyment, that we should be chary 
about placing any obstacles in the way of an effort to develop cultural interests among 
our diverse American population. 
Does the study of music, as it is taught in the schools, count fruitfully toward the 
development of such a cultural interest? Perhaps it does, but certainly in a minor 
sense. To have music taught as an ordinary school subject of recitation in class-rooms 
will not, in generations, greatly affect the cultural education of the people of the 
United States in music. This is a subject which can flourish only as it takes root in 
the cultural life of the people themselves. Such work as the school can do to foster 
that life will be done, not by the hard-and-fast process of class recitation, not by 
exercises upon which the student is to be marked and upon which his standing in the 
school is to be determined, but by bringing the pupil in contact, by one means or 
another, with those who understand and love music, by enabling pupils to hear sim-
-P-A-G-E-99
OUR EDUCATIONAL INTEGRITY 89 
  ple music of a high order well performed, and by cultivating in their life the faculty 
of enjoyment of what is simple and beautiful. In a word, there is a whole series of cul- 
tural subjects with which the school may well deal in a helpful way, but which can- 
not be made a part of the fixed curriculum. That which comes to the pupil through 
such cultural studies comes in large measure through the deeper culture of the teacher 
and his ability to make evident to the pupil the appeal to his emotional nature. That 
formal class exercises do not accomplish this seems fairly evident. That in some cases 
these exercises defeat their own ends and actually give pupils a rooted distaste for 
these fields of activity, is indeed probable. Even in so universal a subject as the 
English language, the class routine in English does not create among children and 
youth any widespread interest in good books. It seems clear that in many cultural 
subjects the school must adopt a different method of presentation from that used in 
those fundamental disciplinary subjects without which the pupil cannot make his way 
into usefulness or understand the problems that lie all about him. 
When one comes to the teaching of household economics, he touches a difficult 
field. So much has been said of the teaching of home economics, and it has indeed so 
sound a ground for a place in the school curriculum, that no thoughtful teacher can 
desire to discourage the study of those subjects which have been embraced under this 
general term. And yet nothing could be more wholesome than an examination of 
what the teaching in home economics is to-day accomplishing in our high schools and 
in our colleges. 
Like nearly all other subjects that touch the industrial and economic vocations 
of life, the teaching of home economics has tended to become professional. Just as 
the schools founded for the teaching of the mechanical trades have almost invaria- 
bly turned themselves into schools of engineering, so the schools of home economics 
tend more and more to become schools for professional training. To-day the school 
of home economics is devoted mainly to the training of specialists, generally teachers 
and dietitians. A group of teachers in a given institution train a certain number of 
young women, who in turn become teachers of other young women. There is great 
need for such teachers and great need for dietitians, but the teaching of home eco- 
nomics was intended to serve a much wider purpose in the public school than that of 
professional training. It was assumed that the subject would be taught in a simple 
fashion so as to place within the reach of all students, at least of the high school, a 
knowledge of simple hygiene and of the economics involved in the administration of 
the home, such as would disseminate amongall groups of the community a better know- 
ledge of wholesome cooking, of food values, and of the simpler and more necessary 
precautions for the preservation of health. To what extent does the teaching of home 
economics to-day serve this latter purpose? It is one thing to institute a course of what 
we call home economics, based upon the modern scientific knowledge, and to make 
that an interesting and productive course for professional students. It is quite another 
thing to make the essential facts involved in housekeeping, in wholesome cook-

ing, and in simple sanitation, available to the mass of students who enter the schools 
and colleges. How far the schools of home economics accomplish these two somewhat 
diverse ends it would be difficult to say, but nothing could be more appropriate than 
an enquiry as to the extent to which they are being met. 
In other words, when the question is asked, as it frequently is, —“ Would you drop 
music and home economics from the new curriculum?” I should say that a sound 
answer is, “I would look into the teaching both of music and of home economics and 
try to determine whether the present methods of teaching were accomplishing that 
which is sought, and whether the cultural end in the one case, and the practical end in 
the other, might not be attained by a process less burdensome on the student and the 
teacher, less expensive for the state, and more likely to reach the great body of the 
school population.” No one will deny that it is easier to say this than to do it; it is 
always easier to add new things than to examine critically those already in opera- 
tion. But we have come toa period in our cumbersome system of education when the 
pressing duty of those who have to do with education is the critical examination of 
what we are now doing and such gradual transformation of the studies and of the 
methods as patient and careful examination may indicate to be wise. 
Tue Tracuen’s Responstsiuity To CIvILizaTIoN 
The school — always using that term in the inclusive sense — is to-day the most 
influential agency in civilization. The primary purpose in its institution and its 
reason for existence to-day lie in the service that it can render to mankind in devel- 
oping and training the powers of the mind during the period of childhood and youth. 
Primarily an intellectual agency, inevitably if it be sincere, its training carries with 
it the by-product of character-building. Its great influence has come out of the indi- 
vidual relation between teacher and pupil, and that relation still remains the most 
important means by which the intellect and the character of children and of youth 
are developed. The reaction of one student mind on another, the influences which so- 
cial contact of pupils may yield in the development of character, are great factors in 
the total contribution of the school to society. But the essential reason for its exist- 
ence still remains the fruitage of the individual relationship between the cultivated 
mind of the teacher and the growing mind of the child. 
Beginning as an individualistic agency, the school has necessarily enormously ex- 
panded its machinery to meet the universal demand for education made in a democ- 
racy. Along with this multiplication of the machinery of education has come a great 
change in the character of the school itself. The individualistic relation between the 
teacher and the pupil tends constantly to be swallowed up in the process of dealing 
with the mass. This transformation involves momentous consequences for society. 
The changes that come in wide-reaching human institutions are themselves among 
the greatest forces that operate upon mankind. They are not spectacular, they do

not come in a moment, they are unseen because they are below the surface, but they 
produce deep, invisible, powerful currents that bear communities and nations they 
know not whither. When the Council of Nicea met, it dealt ostensibly with certain 
questions of Christian dogma and belief. The organization set up through its action 
profoundly changed the civil government of the world. Human organizations, and 
particularly those that have to do with the mind and with the spirit, have made 
their greatest mistakes in the past in the endeavor to compass too many objects, 
most of them good in themselves, but unrelated to the primary purpose for which 
the organizations existed. It is comparatively unimportant whether the school to-day 
offer a vast number of subjects or a smaller number, but it is vital that whatever 
development the school receives in order to meet the needs of new times and of new 
conditions, it shall stand primarily for that intellectual sincerity and that moral sim- 
plicity and thoroughness which constitute its reason for existence. Our problem to- 
day is to preserve this fundamental spirit while at the same time there is developed 
an organization sufficient to deal with the essential needs of the great democratic 
communities. The school will be able to fulfil that purpose only if it hold fast to the 
ideal with which it began. 
Whether that ideal shall remain, whether it shall be the animating spirit of our 
school system, will in the end be decided by the teachers. A coherent and intelligent 
minority, having clear notions of what is needed, will in the long run impress its 
judgment so fully upon the whole people that it will be accepted. The question as to 
what the school is for and what it shall ultimately mean in American civilization 
will be decided by those who labor in the profession of the teacher. That decision 
should be reached thoughtfully, carefully, and in full view of the fact that the process 
of organization itself has in the past profoundly affected the most spiritual of human 
causes; that the school itself, as an agency for the upbuilding of the mind and of the 
character, may be transformed by those very processes of organization that offer 
themselves so readily to our human efforts for improvement. The teachers in whose 
hands rests the future of the twentieth century school should remember the evil that 
in the past has been wrought in other fields by over-organization.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN TEACHERS PENSIONS 
Tue fifteen years devoted to the study of pensions by the Carnegie Foundation and 
other organizations have not been sufficient either to exhaust the many problems in- 
volved or to change much of the sentiment and prejudices associated with the sub- 
ject. In spite of a satisfactory record of progress which has resulted in the adoption 
of sound pension systems in all the states of the North Atlantic Division except New 
Hampshire and Rhode Island, and in Ohio and Wisconsin, bills of the type intro- 
duced in the Kansas and Washington legislatures, amendments looking to the repeal 
of the Indiana, Ohio, and Wisconsin systems, and addresses of the type delivered by 
the Secretary of the Illinois Teachers Pension and Retirement Fund indicate the sur- 
vival of much darkness that still remains to be dissipated. On the other hand, to the 
record of the states of the North Atlantic Division there are to be added the action 
of President Harding in vetoing raids on the federal funds for pensions, the refusal 
of Governor Richardson of California to sign a pension bill passed by both houses of 
the legislature in spite of its obvious unsoundness and in the face of actuarial opinion, 
careful consideration of pension legislation in the State of Minnesota and two of her 
first class cities, St. Paul and Minneapolis, and the resolutions on pensions adopted 
by the National Education Association. 
The attempt to secure the repeal of the pension systems in Ohio and Wisconsin, 
as well as a suit to prove the unconstitutionality of the system in the latter state, 
failed. The motives underlying the movements for repeal are either a feeling that the 
burden on the state is too heavy or the resentment of younger teachers against de- 
ductions from salary. The former is part of the general movement for retrenchment 
which in its sweep takes in both desirable and undesirable activities; the latter is 
largely the result of ignorance and lack of foresight. In Wisconsin, for example, three 
of the younger instructors in the University appeared in favor of the bill with the 
plea that they could invest the sum contributed toward a pension to better advan- 
tage. Pension systems, however, have developed largely because such opportunities 
for good investments have not been seized hitherto, with disastrous results in old 
age. Furthermore, the instructors did not and could not claim that the five per cent 
contributed by the state would be added to their salaries, an important considera- 
tion at any rate for the majority of teachers who enjoy the benefits of sound pension 
systems. 
The Kansas and Washington bills are considered in other sections of this Report. 
The Journal of the Proceedings of the Sixty-eighth Annual Meeting of the Illinois 
State Teachers’ Association contains an excellent statement of the principles under- 
lying a sound pension system by Mr. W. M. Roberts, the principal of a Chicago 
high school, and an extraordinary defence of the Illinois plan by the secretary of 
the fund. This plan, which was adopted in 1915, requires a total contribution of $400 
from the teachers, and is supported by the revenue of two-fifteenths of one mill upon
-P-A-G-E-106
    96 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
each dollar of assessed valuation of all the taxable property of the state, donations, 
gifts, etc. Teachers may retire on a maximum pension of $400 at the age of fifty, 
after twenty-five years of service. Disability allowances are granted after fifteen years 
of service and bear the same ratio to the full pension as the years of service bear to 
the total required. Refunds of one-half of the contributions without interest are 
granted in cases of separation before completing fifteen years of service. This sys- 
tem, according to its secretary, is simple, easily understood, and democratic, since 
all teachers contribute the same amount according to classification, enjoy the same 
benefits, and are in some cases, where the contributions are small, relieved of pay- 
ment by the districts in which they serve. The system is easily administered and is 
solvent according to the state law, having promptly met its obligations and possess- 
ing assets of about $1,000,000. The refund practice is justifiable because the con- 
tributions paid by teachers in the early years of service are small and sometimes 
paid by the districts, while disability allowances are paid after fifteen years of ser- 
vice. The plan is desirable because the majority of contributors are women and are 
satisfied; in other words, since women have no dependents they are “anxious to re- 
ceive whatever pension the state and their own contributions as provided by law may 
give after retirement.” Finally, the plan is a pension and not an insurance law, which, 
as interpreted by the secretary, means that: 
“Our state law is based upon gratitude and not upon greed. Upon magnanim- 
ity rather than upon mathematics. 
“'The law was enacted not for an investment but to give to teachers upon re- 
tirement the assurance of not living in want, rather than in luxury. 
“We hold, according to another statement, that in a Teachers’ Pension Fund 
Law justice should precede mathematics any way.” 
The system is not insolvent because it has met all of its obligations (“insolvent 
means unable to meet one’s obligations”), and has accumulated practically one mil- 
lion dollars assets. The plan is equitable since all pay the same contributions and 
receive the same contributions from the state. It is hard to understand why a state 
or municipality should contribute more to one individual than to another; the high 
salaried teacher should by economy and thrift accumulate enough not to need a pen- 
sion as much as the low salaried teacher. It does not seem to occur to the secretary 
that the argument for a flat pension should also serve, if it were sound, as an agree- 
ment for flat salaries. Finally, in spite of the recent actuarial survey of Illinois pen- 
sions, which showed a deficiency of $20,140,628 in the teachers’ fund, the secretary 
agrees with the Commissioner of Public Instruction in California that our pension 
experience in this country has been incomplete and inadequate, that the regular 
actuarial tables are not applicable to teachers, and that “we would rather err on 
the side of generosity, confident that the state will see us through if we get into deep 
water, than to err on the side of niggardliness.” 
The Standard or Reserve Plan, such as has been adopted in New York City, New 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
TEACHERS PENSIONS 97 
York State, New Jersey, Maine, Vermont, and Ohio, the secretary admits, possesses 
merit and offers a variety of benefits, but may be expensive for the older teachers 
and “is very complicated, intricate, and difficult to understand by the average con- 
tributor.” It is much easier, no doubt, to convince a contributor how a just and mag- 
nanimous system can give a return of about $6500 for total contributions of $400, 
but the question still to be answered by those who continue to appeal to the much 
abused terms of justice, generosity, magnanimity, and democracy, and would draw 
distinctions between pension and insurance principles, is how long the generous State 
of (the state which has an unsound pension system is always generous) will 
be prepared to pay about $6100 to every retired teacher. The secretary of the Illi- 
nois Pension Retirement Fund, relying on the fundamental generosity of the Gen- 
eral Assembly, omitted to discuss the reasons for permitting teachers to retire at the 
age of fifty, or to mention that the contribution of every teacher in active service 
was swallowed up in a fund out of which the pensions were paid, or to justify deduc- 
tions from salaries without refunds of an adequate character and without protection 
for the first fifteen years of service. The teachers are entitled to know whether justice 
will protect them against the future that overtook the New Jersey, New York City, 
and countless other teachers pension systems until they were reorganized and placed 
on a sound foundation warranted both by actuarial and mathematical principles. 
Fortunately, the National Education Association, through its Committee on Sal- 
aries, Tenure, and Pensions, is giving a better lead to the teachers of the country. 
The Committee presented the following resolution for endorsement by representative 
Assembly of the Association at its summer meeting in 1922:   
“We believe that no subject coming before the Association at this time is more 
vital to the progress and advancement of American education and the legiti- 
mate professional interest of the teachers than the establishment of satisfactory 
permanent teachers’ retirement funds where such funds do not now exist. We 
urge the membership of the National Education Association in each state to 
take such steps as will secure the enactment of legislation providing such funds 
where they do not now exist. Every year of delay increases the burden of super- 
annuation and the resultant inefficiency in our public schools, and causes priva- 
tion to hundreds and anxiety to thousands of teachers. 
“We believe that satisfactory results can be secured with the greatest expe- 
dition and certainty if the Association continues the work which it has begun 
and authorizes and directs the appropriate committee to hear all persons inter- 
ested in the problem and directs the committee to prepare and complete its re- 
port with conclusions and recommendations sufficiently in advance of the next 
annual meeting to permit it to be printed in the Journal.” 
The Chairman of the Committee himself presented the following recommendations 
as the fundamental principles of any sound pension system: 
“In the first place we want a retirement system in every State and Territory 
of America that will guarantee not 80 per cent, as we are doing this year, but 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
98 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
100 per cent of the annuity promised by the legislation enacted. That is what 
we want not only in New York, Vermont, and New Jersey, but in every State in 
the Union. We want every teacher guaranteed that. 
“In the second place, we want a disability allowance, so that if a teacher 
becomes disabled either mentally or physically she may be given a retirement 
allowance regardless of the age attained. 
‘*We want a pension system where the contributions after they have once been 
made are non-forfeitable. After the State has once contributed towards the teach- 
er’s retirement that fund belongs to her or her estate and should never be for- 
feited, regardless of whether the teacher remains in that State or goes to an- 
other State or retires entirely. 
“We want an adequate pension system, a system that will guarantee to the 
retiring teacher a retirement allowance that will be comparable with her salary. 
We want an equitable retirement system, and by that I mean that the class- 
room teacher who has been teaching at a low salary in comparison with the high- 
est paid teacher should get a pension comparable with her salary at the time of 
retirement.” 
PENSION AMENDMENTS 
Tuar pension systems will require amendments from time to time as experience 
develops is obvious, and most sound plans include provision for such amendments 
as will not interfere with their contractual character. It is equally obvious that no 
amendments should be considered without a thorough investigation of their finan- 
cial effect. Since most sound plans are introduced with a clear conception of the cost 
involved, it follows that their stability must be affected by amendments that fail to 
take such considerations into account. 
An examination of a large number of amendments proposed for the New York 
City and New York State pension systems indicates that this principle has not been 
taken into account. The New York City teachers are anxious to base pensions on the 
average salary for the last five instead of the last ten years of service. While there is 
nothing objectionable in principle to this proposal, the cost of the system must inev- 
itably be increased by such a change; the amendment contained no reference to this 
important aspect of the problem. Another amendment proposing the optional retire- 
ment of teachers after thirty instead of thirty-five years is both wrong in principle, 
since retirement on the basis of service without an age qualification is inequitable, 
and defective in ignoring the increased cost. Similarly, a proposal to permit certain 
groups of teachers to contribute only three per cent of their salaries without at the 
same time adjusting the rates of allowances must affect the financial basis of the 
fund. The same objection holds against proposals to include teachers who have with- 
drawn from and later returned to service, to increase the minimum pension by one 
hundred per cent, to retire teachers on the basis of any ten years of salary that they 
may select, and to merge local pension systems in the state system and require the 
state to assume their assets and liabilities.
-P-A-G-E-109
PENSION AMENDMENTS 99 
The pressure of political influence compels legislatures to go through the form of 
passing many bills of the type discussed and throwing the burden of further con- 
sideration on the governor or mayors. A loose system of this kind means that every 
interested and aggrieved group will press its demands. 'The establishment in 1918 in 
New York State of a Commission on Pensions “to inquire into the subject of retire- 
ment pensions, allowances and annuities for state and municipal officers and employ- 
ees, especially with reference to the method of establishing and maintaining the fund 
from which such pensions, allowances and annuities shall be paid,” suggests a practical 
method for saving the time of the legislature. Such a commission through its expert 
officers could pronounce on the validity of amendments to existing pension laws be- 
fore they are presented. It is too muck to hope that ill-considered amendments will 
disappear so long as teachers and others do not realize that sound pension systems 
aim to be equitable and just, to conserve the interests of all, and that there is no an- 
tagonism between justice and mathematics, as applied by the actuary to the pension 
problem. In an excellent summary on Pension Legislation,' Miss Ida E. Housman 
directs attention to the same problem and points out that the New Jersey Teachers’ 
Pension and Annuity Law has been jeopardized several times by the introduction of 
unsound amendments. “The important thing to remember in any actuarial pension 
system is—the system may provide any type of benefit, provided those concerned are 
willing to pay the cost.” 
CaLIFoRNIA 
The recent increases in teachers salaries have drawn attention to the inadequacy 
of pension provisions which were established originally without any relation to salary 
scales. The existing pension system for the teachers of California provides a fixed 
pension of $500 a year irrespective of salary obtained after thirty years of service. 
The unsoundness of the system was discussed in the Sixteenth Annual Report. The 
pension is based on contributions from teachers of $12 a year supplemented by five 
per cent of the income from the state inheritance tax. The State Teachers Association 
has for some time realized that the system is insolvent; the inadequacy of the pen- 
sion has emphasized the need of its revision. 
Unfortunately, the two aspects of insolvency and inadequacy have not been con- 
sidered together, with the result that the bill was introduced into the legislature to 
correct the latter but virtually ignoring the former. The amendment proposed an 
increase of the teachers contributions from $12 to $24 a year and an increase on the 
part of the state from five per cent of the income from the state inheritance tax to 
a sum equal to that paid by the teachers. The amount of the pension was to be in- 
creased to $720 a year. Whether the new rate of contributions would yield the amount 
required for pensions was not considered. Governor Richardson refused to sign the 
bill on the ground that the scheme is unsound in principle and that the great ma-

-P-A-G-E-110
100 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
jority of teachers would never receive a dollar in return. In other words, the younger 
teachers are paying for the pensions of those already retired or about to retire within 
the next few years. 
An actuarial enquiry, allowing for the inadequacy of the data, shows that the 
total assets, including the actual and probable future income of the fund, amount to 
$7,147,162.45. The total liabilities of the system, including the present value of pen- 
sions to present teaching force, are $32,760,870.12. The valuation shows a deficiency 
of $25,613,707.67. It is to be noticed that the system does not provide for the refund 
of contributions to teachers who become separated from the fund before becoming 
eligible for retirement. There is no relation between the contributions and the pen- 
sions promised, nor can the receipts from the inheritance tax be anticipated. The 
proposed amendment would not have eliminated either of these defects. The actuary 
accordingly points out that 
“Two courses may be followed in this matter of reorganization of the pension 
system, one to continue as at present until the current pension payments exceed 
the current income, beyond which time the issue cannot be dodged; and the other 
to immediately prepare a reorganization for submission to the next legislature in 
order to forestall the inevitable insolvency. The first course is improper because 
it is unfair to both the teachers and the state. The longer reorganization is post- 
poned the greater become the liabilities to existing pensioners and consequently 
the more difficult the problem of financing the reorganization. The continuation 
of inadequate contributions means either extremely heavy burdens upon present 
teachers after reorganization or the shifting of what they should have been pay- 
ing in the past upon the state. If pensions are to be granted and paid, the ne- 
cessary funds must be raised and postponement of solution of the problem only 
adds to the difficulty.” 
Acting upon this report, Governor Richardson proposed to have the matter looked 
into very carefully during the next two years in the hope that some plan may be de- 
vised to present to the 1925 legislature which will rescue the fund from insolvency. The 
State Commissioner of Education, however, denies that the system is insolvent, resting 
his argument on the fact that the reserves amount to over $1,500,000, and are increas- 
ing at the rate of $200,000 a year. He fails to recognize the difference between im- 
mediate solvency and actuarial bankruptcy, a failure that only means a shifting of the 
burden to future generations. He repeats the arguments employed by him in 1920: 
“While the actuary who investigated the fund is of the opinion that ultimately 
the fund will be exhausted by claims presented by retired teachers, there is no like- 
lihood of this happening during the next fifteen or twenty years. As a matter of 
fact, teachers retirement salary funds are so new that actuarial advice concerning 
them can only be a guess. After we have had longer experience with our fund we 
shall beable to determine more exactly what should be doneto properly finance it.” 
Whether the teachers of the state will be ready to adopt this pioneering spirit 
in the realm of mathematics is very doubtful; it is equally clear that politics, which 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  PENSION AMENDMENTS 101 
appear to be playing a part in the situation, have no more to do with actuarial prin- 
ciples than with the law of gravitation. As the actuary pointed out in his report, 
other states have already passed through the experiences that the commissioner de- 
sires for his state and have reorganized their systems. 
Kansas 
A state teachers pension bill, introduced before the Kansas legislature, managed 
to crowd within its brief compass most of the mistakes that have been made in the 
history of pensions. It is true that the system proposed was to be compulsory and 
on a contributory basis, but beyond that it was thoroughly and hopelessly unsound. 
Teachers were to contribute $12 a year during their first ten years of service, $18 a 
year during the next five, $24 a year during the five following years, and $30 a year 
for the next ten, or a total of $630. The state was to contribute an amount equal to 
the aggregate sum contributed each year by the teacher. Retirement was permitted 
by the bill after thirty years of service without an age qualification on an annuity 
equal to half of the annual salary received at the time of retirement, with a minimum 
of $400 and a maximum of $600. Disability allowances were to be paid in cases of 
disability occurring after fifteen years of service, consisting of an annuity of as many 
thirtieths of the full annuity for thirty years as a teacher had taught years. Teachers 
withdrawing from service during the first fifteen years were to be given a refund of 
their contributions to which interest was to be added after the fifteenth year of ser- 
vice. Appropriations of $50,000 a year for each of the first two years following the 
inauguration of the fund were to be made by the state. 
The absurdity of the system is indicated by the following figures. The present value 
of a pension of $500 a year beginning at the age of fifty is estimated to be $7300. 
Under the proposed bill teachers would have contributed a total of $630 during thirty 
years; the bill in fact only required teachers to have contributed one-half of the 
expected annuity. At the best there would remain a deficiency of $6670 to be paid 
presumably out of the state appropriations. After this example of pension financing 
it is unnecessary to refer to the danger of basing pensions on final salary, to the in- 
justice to teachers in withholding interest on their contributions in cases of with- 
drawal, and to the cost of a system that retires teachers after thirty years of service 
without an age qualification. Under the circumstances, it must have been a cynic who 
was responsible for the inclusion of a section in the bill requiring a thorough exami- 
nation of the system by a competent actuary or actuaries once every three years, “or 
oftener if deemed necessary.” 
Marve 
By the adoption of a newpension plan for the public school teachers of Maine, sound 
pension systems have now been established in all the states of the North Atlantic
-P-A-G-E-112
  102 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
Division except New Hampshire and Rhode Island. The Maine system, which is to 
become effective on June 1, 1924, is to be administered by a retiring board consisting 
of seven members — the state superintendent of public instruction, the state treasurer, 
attorney-general, commissioner of banking, and commissioner of insurance, and two 
teachers. Since the system is on a contributory basis, it would seem that the teachers 
are entitled to more representation than is here provided. The teachers will contribute 
five per cent of their salaries with a minimum of $20 and a maximum of $100 a year, 
but contributions are to be made only for thirty years. The state will contribute a sum 
equal to the aggregate contributions of the teachers up to a maximum of $35,000 a 
year. All contributions are to be held to the individual accounts of the teachers, who 
may retire from service on reaching the age of sixty and after thirty years of service, 
twenty of which must be in the State of Maine. The retiring allowance may be taken 
either in the form of an annuity purchasable by the accumulated contributions, or in 
some form of optional settlement. Disability allowances will be paid to teachers who 
become incapacitated for further work after six years of service, and will consist of such 
annuity as may be purchased by the teachers’ contributions, plus such amount as may 
be granted by the retirement board after taking into account the earning capacity of 
the teacher; the total allowance is limited to one-half of the teacher’s average salary 
and will be continued so long as justified by annual medical examinations. In the 
event of separation from service either on account of death, resignation, or dismissal 
before the completion of six years of service, the teachers’ contributions will be re- 
turned with interest; to this the state’s contributions will be added if the separation 
takes place after six years of service. An actuarial valuation every three years is re- 
quired. The system has the merit of being simple and, altho an actuarial estimate of 
the future liabilities has not been made, the cost to the state at any rate is limited by 
the introduction of a maximum annual contribution on its part, which for the pres- 
ent appears sufficiently adequate. The absence of a provision to meet the accrued lia- 
bilities is noticeable, but is explained by the fact that the new system is not a substi- 
tute for but a supplement to the old non-contributory plan. This was amended in the 
same legislature by raising the amount of the pension from $250 to $300 a year. 
Teachers now in service may exercise a choice between the two systems; new teachers 
must join the contributory plan. While not a satisfactory solution of the problem of 
accrued liabilities, the retention of the old plan will leave the development of the new 
system clear and free to some extent from entanglements. 
Miynesora 
Seven years of experience with a pension system enacted in 1915 have convinced 
the teachers of Minnesota of its unsoundness. The system undertook on the basis of 
total contributions of $425 from the teachers, and half of this sum from the state, 
to retire teachers at the age of fifty on pensions of $500 a year. On July 31, 1922, it
-P-A-G-E-113
  
PENSION AMENDMENTS 103 
was found that the assets of the fund amounted to $717,800 and the liabilities to 
$9,650,000 —a deficit of $8,932,200. The liabilities were computed roughly on a 
group basis, assuming average ages. The fund is accordingly becoming impaired at 
the rate of one and one-third million dollars a year, without allowing for any increase 
in the number of teachers in the service. 
The Board of the State Teachers Insurance and Retirement Fund accordingly pro- 
posed an amendment of the system. The same benefit on retirement, $500, and the 
same retiring age, fifty, were retained as in the existing system, but the period of ser- 
vice was extended from twenty-five to thirty years. Teachers who continued in service 
for thirty-five years might retire on a pension of $744. Teachers may elect an op- 
tional form of settlement under which they will receive the interest from their accu- 
mulations during their lifetime, the principal to be paid at death to a designated 
beneficiary. In cases of disability occurring after fifteen years of service and continu- 
ous for not less than six months, an allowance of $250 a year, increased by $25 a year 
for each year above fifteen and up to a maximum of $509, is to be paid. In order to 
encourage disabled teachers to return to service on recovery, the state will restore to 
the teacher’saccount the sums disbursed during the period of disability. Refunds of the 
teachers’ contributions are to be paid with four per cent interest in the event of death, 
resignation, or dismissal, with additions from the state of 25 per cent of the accumu- 
lations after ten years of service increased by five per cent for each year up to twenty- 
five, when the contributions from the state will equal those of the teacher. The accrued 
liabilities are to be met in a novel way: since the contributions under the existing sys- 
tem are inadequate to pay the promised pension, teachers will be required to give four 
per cent notes for the amount of the deficiency, to be paid off in a fifteen to twenty year 
period. The state will assist teachers above the age of thirty-five in the payment of 
these notes at such rates that a teacher above the age of forty-five will receive three 
dollars from the state for every dollar contributed by him. All teachers will be required 
to contribute $64.79 a year which, with the state’s contributions, to begin after the 
completion by a teacher of ten years of service, and interest at four per cent will accu- 
mulate $7268, the amount required to purchase an annuity of $500 at the age of fifty. 
‘The amendment, which was not enacted, has the merit of emphasizing the principle 
that pensions must be adequately financed, and that the best method is an equal shar- 
ing of the burden by the teachers and the state. The progressive increase of the dis- 
ability allowance is suggestive, but retains the old notion that a pension is a reward 
for service, rather than an instrument for promoting efficiency; incapacity after fifteen 
years of service leaves a teacher no less helpless than after a longer period. Provision 
for meeting the accrued liabilities has been carefully considered, but raises a ques- 
tion of policy, whether it is equitable to place any part of the burden on the teacher. An 
unanticipated tax, even tho actually in the form of savings, imposed on low salaries 
may work untold hardship. For the rest the amendment is questionable in value. The 
flat rate of pension of $500 is at the present time less than half of the average salary
-P-A-G-E-114
    104 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
paid to teachers in Minnesota; and it is too small a sum on which to retire the better 
paid teachers. Undoubtedly it offers some protection, but it is not related to the prog- 
ress of salaries and standards of living. The rates of contributions are the same for 
men as for women, with the probable result that the former are paying too much for 
their benefits. Finally, there is no justification either in fact or in theory, for permit- 
ting retirement at as early an age as fifty; those who are too incapacitated to work 
beyond this age are eligible to disability benefits. An increase in the age of retirement 
and an adequate adjustment between salaries and pensions would have the advantage 
of distributing the burden to the teacher and ultimately of reducing the cost to the 
state. 
Minneapoiis AND Sr. Pavui 
The pension systems of Minneapolis and St. Paul, which were established in 1909, 
are both passing through the same critical stage as the state system. A valuation of 
the Minneapolis system shows that the present value of the liabilities is $5,596,182 
and the assets $2,817,799, leaving a deficit of $2,778,383. The system is supported by 
contributions from the teachers, and a city tax levy of two-tenths mills; an increase 
to three-tenths mills would still leave a large deficit. The actuaries accordingly made 
the following recommendations as a basis for revision: 
Membership in the retirement plan should become compulsory upon the attainment 
of an age which makes it reasonably probable that teaching has been adopted as a pro- 
fession. The teachers and the city should make annual contributions toward retirement 
benefits, and such deposits should not be subject to forfeiture on separation from ser- 
vice before retirement. The benefits at retirement should bear such relation to age, 
length of service, and compensation as to encourage long service and make possible the 
retirement without hardship of teachers no longer able to give satisfactory service on 
account of age or disability. The cost of accrued liabilities for past services should be 
borne by the city, which should meet the just expectations of present and retired teach- 
ers. The reserve basis should be adopted both for the payment of future benefits and 
for the establishment of a fund to pay pensions already granted, benefits on account 
of past services, and additional benefits to adjust present rights and expectations. 
Following these recommendations, a new system has been adopted, and will become 
effective on January 1, 1924. It provides for compulsory membership of all teachers 
from the age of twenty-five, and for annual contributions of five per cent of salary; 
the city’s contributions will begin with one and one-half per cent of a teacher’s salary, 
and be increased by one-fourth of one per cent for each year of service until nine per 
cent is reached, but only up to a maximum salary of $3000. The new plan guarantees 
full annuities for present pensioners, and provides for the amortization of the present 
liabilities of about $3,000,000 by annual sums of about $140,000 spread over fifty 
years. Refunds of contributions with interest are granted in cases of separation from 
service before becoming eligible to retirement; the city’s contributions will also be
-P-A-G-E-115
  PENSION AMENDMENTS 105 
paid in instalments only to teachers who withdraw from service after the age of fifty. 
Teachers may retire after reaching the age of fifty and completing thirty years of 
service on such annuities as may be purchased with their accumulations. An increase 
of the tax levy limit to one and five-tenths mills, recently approved by the legisla- 
ture, has made the increased participation of the city possible. 
The new plan is in many ways similar to that recently adopted in Wisconsin and 
has many of the same elements of flexibility. The distinguishing feature is the grad- 
uated increase of the city’s contributions, which, taking advantage of the short tenure 
of the majority of teachers, reduces the cost of the system in the early stages. 
The city of St. Paul has not yet reached the same stage as Minneapolis, but is 
suffering from the malaise that usually precedes valuations, discussions, and reform. 
Under the present system teachers contribute one per cent of their salaries up to 
$25 a year and the city may contribute up to one and five-tenths of the tax levy; 
retirement on a pension of $600 is possible after twenty-five years of service, and 
disability allowances may be granted after five years of service. A report on all the 
pension systems maintained in the city for teachers, police and firemen, and the em- 
ployees of the health service shows that 
“The statutes covering the various pension funds now in operation appear to be 
built upon no scientific basis. Increases in pensions are granted; appropriation 
limitations are increased, — all without a study to determine the effect. The atti- 
tude seems to be to permit the institution of pension systems and specify the 
benefits. If sufficient money is not secured into a pension fund, the employes 
attempt to secure an increase in the amount that the city can appropriate. Upon 
the city then falls the expense.” 
The report recommends the passage of an enabling act to give the common council 
power to supervise the establishment of pension associations, the appointment of a 
board of administration, and the employment of an actuary. An immediate outcome 
of the general investigation is the appointment by the trustees of the teachers re- 
tirement fund association of an actuary to make a valuation of the fund. 
A study of the pension situation in Minnesota inevitably discloses a great deal of 
waste motion and inefficiency due to lack of codperation. At about the same time 
the inadequacy of all the pension systems—the state and the city systems—(the 
Duluth situation was discussed in the last Report) is discovered. Each system insti- 
tutes investigations, which may, but for the fact that the Twin Cities employed the 
same actuary, lead to four different systems in the state and militate against migra- 
tion. A sounder policy would have pointed to a revision of the pension systems on a 
state basis. 
PutuirrinE Istanps 
The Fifth Philippine Legislature has enacted a pension system for the teachers in 
the Islands which, while on a contributory basis, is actuarially unsound. The system  
-P-A-G-E-116
    106 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
is to be administered by a Pension and Investment Board consisting of the Secretary 
of Public Instruction, the Director of Education, the Insular Treasurer, the Insular 
Auditor, and three members, of whom two must be teachers, appointed by the Gov- 
ernor-General. Teachers are required to contribute three per cent of their monthly 
salaries, which will be duplicated, but not assigned to individual accounts, by the 
Government. The funds are to be supplemented by moneys “resulting from fines, 
leaves of absence without pay, unfilled positions, and other salary savings for posi- 
tions the holders of which are or will be entitled to the provisions of this Act, and 
with donations, gifts, legacies, or bequests of individuals, corporations, or organiza- 
tions.” Teachers may retire at any time after twenty years of service without an age 
qualification on pensions rising by one-tenth every three years from four-tenths of 
average salary during the last three years of service up to eight-tenths of this aver- 
age after thirty-two or more years of service. A maximum pension of 4000 pesos 
is established. Disability allowances will be granted after fifteen years of service on 
the ground of unfitness certified by the Director of Education and a government 
health officer; the allowance is to consist of an annuity of two-tenths of computed 
average salary. Medical reéxaminations are to be made twice each year, and by a 
curious provision such allowances are limited to ten years. In the event of death 
during service a benefit of fifty per cent of the amount to which a teacher would 
have been entitled at the pensionable age is to be paid to surviving acknowledged 
children until the age of eighteen, or to the surviving lawful husband or wife until 
remarriage. Contributions will be refunded with four per cent compound interest to 
teachers leaving the service before becoming entitled to a pension. All conditions 
appear to have been provided for in this Act except financial soundness and security. 
No provision is made for meeting the accrued liabilities, or to relate the contribu- 
tions to the prospective benefits, or to prevent retirement after twenty years of service 
as early as the age of forty. 
‘WasHINGTON 
The pension system proposed for the teachers in the State of Washington was not 
unlike the Kansas proposal in its defects, the only variant being the introduction 
of a flat pension of $480 a year instead of a pension equal to half of the final annual 
salary. The total contributions of the teachers were to be $720, and retirement was 
to be permitted after thirty years without an age qualification. The contributions. 
from the state were less clearly defined; if in any year the contributions from the 
teacher were inadequate to pay the pensions, the deficiency was to be made up from 
the inheritance taxes, and, if this sum did not suffice, then from the general fund, 
but only up to the sum contributed by the teachers in the preceding year; if a defi- 
ciency was still to exist, then all allowances were to be prorated. Refunds were to 
be made only in cases of death or dismissal, but without interest. Legislation of this 
kind can only be paralleled in the earliest years of the pension movement. To-day it
-P-A-G-E-117
  FEDERAL PENSIONS 107 
seems inconceivable that any public authority or any body of teachers would be 
willing to enter into pension systems of a type that has so frequently met with disaster. 
FEDERAL PENSIONS 
Tur United States Civil Service Commission has collected evidence on the operation 
of the Civil Service Retirement Act, which was passed in 1920. Altho the period that 
has elapsed since the passing of the Act is too short to yield any definite conclu- 
sions and has coincided with considerable retrenchments in the service consequent 
on the winding-up of numerous war activities, some results are already recognized. 
As might have been expected, during this period the effect of the retirement sys- 
tem on turn-over could not well be gauged; on the other hand, there is adequate evi- 
dence from many departments and bureaus of a new hopefulness among the younger 
employees and of a decline in the lethargy often noticeable among those of middle age. 
The existence of an annuity system has rendered it possible to retire those whose effi- 
ciency had declined on account of age and at the same time has in many cases im- 
proved the general efficiency of the service by opening up the avenues of promotion. 
The chief criticism of the plan centres round the adequacy of the annuity, which is 
limited to a maximum of $720, a sum which may be adequate in most cases, but is 
often inequitable for the high-salaried officers. Many critics of the systems advocate 
a reduction of the age of retirement from seventy to sixty-eight or even sixty-five, 
with opportunities for continuance in the service as circumstances may warrant. The 
survey is important if only because it emphasizes the central fact that the existence 
of a retirement system is warranted mainly in promoting efficiency of service. This 
fact established, amendments along sound principles, on which the Act was not 
wholly based, may well follow. 
The cost of the federal pension undertakings during the fiscal year 1921-22 
amounted to $255,201,662, of which $1,394,079 was for maintenance. This total 
represented a decrease of $4,908,259 over the previous year, due to the number of 
deaths among veterans of the Civil War. The total number of pensioners was 
547,016 and included forty-nine widows of soldiers of the War of 1812. The annual 
reduction in the cost of federal pensions is not as rapid as would be expected from 
the increasing death rate among veterans, since each year some politician, actuated 
by motives of generosity and compassion combined with political hopes, advocates an 
increase in the amount of the pension. During the past year, Senator Bursum intro- 
duced a bill providing pensions of $50 a month for all widows of Civil War veter- 
ans, increasing the pensions of veterans from $50 to $72 a month, and raising the 
amounts payable to Mexican War veterans and the widows of veterans of the War 
of 1812. This bill was passed by the Senate and would have meant a total increase 
of $108,000,000 in the annual pension bill. Fortunately, President Harding vetoed
-P-A-G-E-118
  108 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
the bill and returned it with the following message, which placed him by the side of 
President Cleveland as refusing to adopt an easy but costly read to popularity: 
“Tf the act were limited to its provisions in behalf of the surviving participants 
in the Mexican and Civil Wars, and widows of the War of 1812, it would still 
be without ample justification. The Commissioner of Pensions estimates its ad- 
ditional cost to the Treasury to be $108,000,000 annually, and I venture the 
prediction that with such a precedent established, the ultimate pension outlay 
in the half century before us will exceed fifty billions of dollars. The act makes 
no pretense of new considerations for the needy or dependent; no new generosity 
for veteran wards of the nation; it is an outright bestowal upon the Govern- 
ment’s pension rolls, with a heedlessness for the Government’s financial problems 
which is a discouragement to every effort to reduce expenditures and thereby 
relieve the Federal burdens of taxations. 
“The more particular objection to this act, however, lies in its loose provi- 
sions for pensioning widows. The existing law makes the widow of a Civil War 
veteran eligible to a pension if she married him prior to June 27, 1905. In other 
words, marriage within forty years of the Civil War gives a veteran’s widow a 
good title to a pension. The act returned herewith extends the marriage period 
specifically to June 27, 1915, and provides that after that date any marriage or 
cohabitation for two years prior to a veteran’s death shali make the widow the 
beneficiary of a pension at $50 per month for the remainder of her life. 
“ In view of the fact that this same bill makes provision for pensions for widows 
of the veterans of the War of 1812, the possible burden of this sweeping pro- 
vision seems worthy of serious consideration. Frankly, I do not recognize any 
public obligation to pension women who now, nearly sixty years after the Civil 
‘War, become the wives of veterans of that war. 
“ The Government has so many defenders to whom generous treatment is due, 
that Congress will find it necessary to consider all phases of our obligations 
when making provisions for any one group. 
“The compensation paid to the World War veterans, those who shared the 
shock and sorrows of the conflict, amounts to $24 per month. It would be in- 
defensible to insist on that limitation upon actual war widows, if we are to pay 
$600 per year to widows who marry veterans sixty years after the Civil War.” 
AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 
Tue pension plan for the employees of the American Museum of Natural History 
has completed ten years of its existence. In the Tenth Annual Report of the Pension 
Board the occasion is used for congratulation on the success of the fund. The system 
is financed by contributions of the employees who choose to become subscribing mem- 
bers and pay three per cent of their salaries, which sum is duplicated by the trustees. 
The conditions for retirement are extremely flexible. Male employees may retire at 
the age of sixty after twenty years of service or at the age of sixty-five after fifteen 
years of service; female employees with similar periods of service may retire five years 
earlier in each case. The allowance varies with the age and length of service and ranges  
-P-A-G-E-119
AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 109 
  from a minimum of $180 a year after fifteen years of service to a maximum of half 
average annual salary for the last three years after thirty years of service. A curious 
provision limits the duration of the pension to the number of years of service com- 
pleted before retirement, except that the pension is granted for life on the completion 
of thirty years of service. Gratuities are paid to dependents of employees who die 
during service or after retirement. 
Since the system of retirement is complicated and the financial basis bears no rela- 
tion to the pensions to be paid, the ultimate cost cannot be anticipated. In its report 
the Pension Board takes credit to itself from the fact that the “subscribers do not 
claim all the benefits to which they are entitled, it being well known that many who 
are eligible to be retired and draw pensions prefer to continue in their usual lines of 
employment. Therefore, instead of being a source of expense, they remain a source of 
income.” A better explanation of this continuance in employment, however, is found 
in the figures given in the report of the amount and duration of the pensions granted 
to the employees already retired: 
Yearly Allowance Period of Pension 
$416.00 16 years 
253.03 15 years 
988.00 Life 
455.56 23 years 
527.29 23 years 
406.16 18 years 
The amount of the pension with the cost of living as at present and the uncertainty 
whether the pension will continue until death may be important factors that weigh 
with employees eligible for retirement. The status of the fund, had all those eligible 
for retirement exercised their right, would probably not have been as favorable as it 
appears to be to the trustees. There is a fallacy in the assumption of the Board that 
the tendency of the employees to continue their work showed that any danger of a 
deficiency in the fund might be theoretical rather than practical. A pension fund has 
no more justification than an insurance company to count on theoretical rather than 
practical deficiencies. The important question is whether the fund is so organized that 
it can at any time meet all the contingencies to which it is liable. In view of the con- 
gratulatory tone of the report, the following statement appears interesting: 
“Therefore we do not feel inclined to recommend at this time any special form 
of safeguard or the setting aside of an emergency fund on the part of the 
trustees, feeling that they as well as their successors, will at all times, should 
the need arise, give full consideration to the obligations of the fund, and to the 
employees. While we hope that this may never occur, it may, at some later date, 
be necessary to alter the Rules somewhat so as to meet any liabilities which may 
arise,”

    110 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
INDUSTRIAL PENSIONS 
Tur development of industrial pension systems has been checked to some extent by 
the retrenchments following the war, and to some degree by uncertainty as to the 
value of the more common type of pensions already introduced. A few systems follow- 
ing these lines have been established and possess all the features that have come to be 
regarded as unsound: they are non-contributory, discretionary, and non-contractual. 
The pension plan for the subsidiary companies of the Bethlehem Company, “estab- 
lished in recognition of the long and faithful service of many employees who have 
given the better part of their lives in its service, aiding toward its advance to progress 
and who have reached or will reach an age necessitating their retirement,” provides 
a pension of one per cent of the average yearly wage during the last ten years of ser- 
vice for each year of service, with a minimum of $180 and a maximum of $1200 a 
year, to employees who have reached the age of sixty-five and have completed twenty- 
five years of service. A disability pension calculated in the same way but without a 
specified minimum is promised to employees who become wholly incapacitated after 
fifteen years of service. The companies retain the right to change, alter, or modify the 
pension plan, or to terminate it after giving at least thirty days notice. 
The general lines of the pension plan adopted by the Commonwealth Edison Com- 
pany of Chicago are somewhat similar in character. Here employees may retire at the 
age of fifty-five after thirty years of service, or at sixty after fifteen years of service, 
or at sixty-five after five years of service. The pension consists of an allowance for 
each year of service of one and one-half per cent of average annual pay during the 
particular consecutive five years of service when such average pay was highest. A 
minimum pension of $300 and a maximum of $6000 are established. If the cost of 
the plan in any age exceeds one per cent of the gross income of the Company, the 
pensions will be prorated. The plan is not contractual. 
A non-contractual pension system, with rights of amendment, suspension, and an- 
nulment reserved to the Board of Directors of the Company, has been established 
by The Marine Trust Company of Buffalo. Employees may be retired after twenty 
years of service at the age of sixty-five, if men, and sixty, if women, with compulsory 
retirement ages at seventy and sixty-five respectively. The retiring and disability 
allowances consist of two per cent of average annual salary during the last three 
years of service for each year of service up to twenty-five, with a minimum of $720 
and a maximum of $3000. The disability pension is payable after ten years of ser- 
vice after examination by a physician selected by the Pension Committee. 
The history of industrial pensions is repeating the history of teachers pensions, 
and appears to have reached the stage attained by the latter about 1915. Whatever 
the practice in industry may be—and the practice is overwhelmingly of the type rep- 
resented by the systems here described — all serious discussions of the problems are
-P-A-G-E-121
  
INDUSTRIAL PENSIONS 11 
wholly in favor of the principles now generally accepted as sound for the teaching 
profession. The recent reports of the Merchants Association of New York and of 
the National Personnel Association advocate the adoption of the contributory prin- 
ciple in industrial pensions, and the recognition that the chief purpose of a pension 
is to promote efficient service and that “a pension promise that is not certain in- 
volves an uncertain morality.” An excellent summary of the present condition of 
industrial pensions and a thoroughly objective analysis of the theory involved is con- 
tained in 4 Critical Analysis of Industrial Pension Systems, by Luther Conant, Jr., 
the result of an investigation of the problem made for the Bemis Brothers Bag Com- 
pany of Boston. The work discusses the purposes of pension systems, non-contribu- 
tory pension systems of the “discretionary” and of the “limited-contractual” type, 
contributory pension systems, cumulative “single-premium” annuities as a substitute 
for pensions, the cost of pensions and annuities, and the benefits to be included. On 
the whole, the author appears to be in favor of the single premium annuity policies 
as the most effective type in industries, and a tabular analysis of the advantages and 
disadvantages of the various types proves the author’s contentions adequately. The 
most vital question in the organization of a pension system, however, is whether the 
system recognizes definite rights on the part of the employee; whether the employee 
contributes directly or not is a subsidiary matter; yet 
“While, however, the question of direct contributions is of less importance than 
the question of contractual right, the contributory system is to be recom- 
mended wherever it is practicable. Not only will workers ordinarily take a keener 
interest in the plan, but they can feel that they are largely providing for their 
superannuation through their own effort.” 
The employer who reads this book, which deals exhaustively with all phases of the 
pension problem and presents every shade of opinion and practice in the field, is ad- 
equately warned about the cost and the importance of actuarial assistance. Useful 
information is presented in an analysis of existing plans and in the selected bibliog- 
raphy. The concluding paragraphs contain the best criticisms of existing systems 
and suggestions for an adequate solution: 
“If Industry is to undertake to deal with the superannuation problem at all, it 
may fairly be required to devise some more equitable and more effective method 
than that reflected in existing pension practice. In this respect the annuity sys- 
tem... has a particular appeal, and especially its introduction could be made 
general among industrial establishments. With such a system in practically 
universal operation, the great body of wage-earners would be making some pro- 
vision for support in old age and (except for the “trial service” period) pro rata 
with every year of service rendered. Because of this fact the annuity system 
seems entitled to most serious consideration, not only by industrial executives, 
but by the public at large.”

This is, of course, the position already accepted in the best pension systems re- 
cently established for teachers, and is essentially the plan which, following the con- 
sideration of the problem in the Ninth Bulletin of the Foundation, 4 Comprehensive 
Plan of Insurance and Annuities for College Teachers, is represented in the establish- 
ment of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America.

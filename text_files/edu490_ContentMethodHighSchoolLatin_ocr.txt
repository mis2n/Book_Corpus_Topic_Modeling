  CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
Purpose of the Study.—This study seeks primarily to dis- 
cover just how the high-school pupil regards and attacks the 
various phases of his Latin work, and to what extent there 
is agreement between what the pupil says he is doing and 
the things his teacher thinks he is doing or says he should 
be doing. These questions are considered in the light of 
data obtained from answers given by pupils and from cor- 
responding statements made by their teachers. This inves- 
tigation does not purpose a pedagogical study of high-school 
Latin to the extent of outlining a specific course as to con- 
tent and method. It does purpose to reveal significant 
points of view on the part of pupils and their teachers which 
will quite definitely indicate needs of the Latin course both 
as to content and method. Stated specifically, the study at- 
tempts to answer the following questions: 
1. What are the chief motives which have influenced high- 
school pupils to continue their Latin for four years? 
2. What are the causes that have induced many of their 
classmates to drop the subject? 
8. What is the relative interest which pupils feel in the 
different parts of the reading course in Latin? 
4. What are the principal methods which pupils use in 
_ preparing their lessons in Latin? 
5. As judged by the pupil, what methods are usually em- 
ployed by their teachers in conducting the class recitation, 
and which of these methods make the strongest appeal to the 
pupil? 
6. What relation do the theories and principles of Latin 
teaching as advocated by the high-school instructors bear 
to the results of their teaching as shown by answers to the 
above questions in general, and to the problems involved in 
8, 4, and 5 in particular? 
7. What are the educational implications of the answers 
to the above-mentioned questions as regards the objectives, 
Sone and methods of high-school Latin study and teach- 
ing? 
Answers to these questions are attempted in the several 
chapters by the analyses, comparisons, and conclusions 
which they seem to warrant. 
Sources of the Data.—This dissertation grew out of a study 
which the writer made in connection with the Classical In-
-P-A-G-E-10
ee ee nee 
10 Content and Method in High-School Latin 
vestigation conducted throughout the United States during 
the years 1921-23 by the Advisory Committee of the Ameri- 
can Classical League, which had support from the General 
Education Board of New York. 
The data were secured from two sources: first, from an- 
swers by pupils; and, second, from similar answers by their 
teachers. 
1. Replies were secured from pupils by means of a ques- 
tion blank on “Content and Method in High-School Latin” 
sent out in 1923 by the Special Investigating Committee of 
the League. The blank, before being presented to the pu- 
pils from whose replies the data have been collected, went 
through several revisions after being tried with various 
groups of pupils and being criticized by a number of teach- 
ers in the field. Approximately 7,500 of these blanks for 
pupils were sent to their teachers, who had previously agreed 
to have their high-school seniors, just completing the fourth 
year of Latin study, fill them out and return. Out of the 
7,500 blanks sent, 4,250 replies were received from these 
pupils. Of these replies, 3,600 have been used in the tabu- 
lations, 600 were discarded because filled out by pupils with 
fewer than four years of Latin, and 50 were returned too 
late to be included. The replies represent 280 schools, lo- 
cated in 267 towns and cities in 41 states. 
2. In order to have a basis for the comparison of the view- 
points of pupils and of their teachers and to provide a com- 
plete answer to question 6 as given above, definite and pre- 
cise statements were needed from the teachers who had 
taught the 3,600 pupils already mentioned. Accordingly, 
another questionnaire, asking for data similar to those re- 
quested in the blank sent to high-school seniors, was sent by 
the writer in 1924 to teachers of Latin in the high schools 
referred to above. The names of all Latin teachers who had 
been in their positions for two years or more were secured 
for 196 of these schools. In each of the other 84 schools the 
questionnaire was sent to one or more teachers when their 
names were available; and when these were not to be had, 
the blanks were addressed to the head of the Latin depart- 
ment. In all, 617 blanks were sent to as many teachers or 
heads of departments, of which 353 (57.2%) were filled out 
and returned.t. Of this number, 23 could not be used, be- 
cause they had been filled out by teachers who either failed 
to state how long they had been in their present position or   
1See Appendix for copies of the questionnaire sent to pupils and to teachers, and a 
list of schools from which the 3,600 replies from pupils came. The names and ad- 
dresses of all teachers whose replies were used in the study are on file in the library of 
George Peabody College for Teachers.

else had been connected with the school only one year. The 
teachers’ replies came from 211 schools in 198 cities and 
towns located in 89 states. The median number of years 
which these teachers had spent in the places where they 
were employed at the time when they returned the blanks 
was 7. 
Reliability of the Data.—Data secured through the ques- 
tionnaire method are always open to certain objections, and, 
like all other data, must be interpreted with caution. For 
this reason it is not claimed that the data here presented are 
highly objective and scientific in the strictest sense. It is 
believed, however, that they are fully as reliable as those 
of similar studies, and sufficiently so to be of real worth. 
It is to be expected that a high-school senior would be able 
to point out rather definitely some of the things he had fre- 
quently observed and done during the study of a subject 
extending over four full years. There are evidences to show 
that the replies from the pupils do give a representative, 
accurate, and honest description of the reaction of high- 
school boys and girls to their Latin experiences. The char- 
acter of the replies indicates that the pupils felt perfectly 
free to answer as they pleased ; yet very few papers showed 
any sign of intentional carelessness or frivolity, and these 
few papers were not used. Certain tendencies are clearly 
indicated by the data secured from the pupils, and many of 
the results are confirmed by other independent but correla- 
tive studies? which touch a number of points in this investi- 
gation. On the basis of all these evidences, the writer be- 
lieves that the pupils took the questionnaire seriously, and 
that the data thus secured are reliable in all fundamental 
respects. 
Essentially the same things could be said relative to the 
replies from the teachers. The failure of the replies¢from 
pupils and teachers to agree at a number of points does not 
invalidate the data from either source. The discrepancies, 
which will be discussed at the proper place in the study, can 
be accounted for in a way to suggest very vital and signifi- 
cant considerations. 
That this investigation deals with important problems 
connected with the study and teaching of Latin, and that 
the results will be of practical value in the classroom work 
of the Latin teacher, will become apparent as the evidence   
*In footnotes the other studies referred to will be mentioned or quoted in connec- tion with the presentation and analysis of the data of this report whenever such stud- ies seem to verify the results or throw light on the problem at hand. Among the more important studies quoted or referred to are those made by Thorndike, Ruger, Uhl, Judd, Hare, Swan, Brown, Ullman, and the General Report of the Classical Investi- gation (1924) conducted by the Advisory Committee of the American Classical League.

12 Content and Method in High-School Latin 
is presented. The study carries the problem to the “ulti- 
mate consumer’”—the high-school pupil—and through a de- 
scription of his reaction enables the teacher to judge his own 
work on the basis of results produced. No program of stud- 
ies or methods in classroom procedure could rest finally 
upon the experience and judgment of high-school pupils 
alone. But a description of their experiences in school and 
a statement of the opinions they have of their studies and 
teachers are valuable, and, when frankly and honestly given, 
ought to provide educators with some very helpful if not 
indispensable criteria. The reactions of pupils in connec- 
tion with the practices advocated by teachers and other edu- 
cators would seem to hold out the hope of helping toward the 
solution of many difficulties met in any program that prom- 
ises maximum returns from a high-school subject. For 
these reasons the information made available through this 
investigation should help in formulating an effective Latin 
program as regards objectives in Latin study and teaching, 
as regards the content of the courses offered, and as regards 
methods of realizing the objectives decided upon as valid. 
Method of Treating the Data.——The method employed in 
the treatment of the data in this study is both statistical and 
discursive. Summary tables are used for the presentation 
and comparison of all data collected. These tables are fol- 
lowed or accompanied by necessary interpretations and ex- 
planations. The questions stated in the purposes of the 
investigation are, with the exception of question 6, treated 
in separate chapters. Question 6 is treated in the compari- 
sons made in Chapters IV, V, and VI. At the end of each 
chapter a summary of the findings relative to the question 
under consideration is made. Chapter VII is devoted to a 
general summary and to conclusions based on the chapter 
summaries. Finally, Chapter VIII contains further inter- 
pretations of the facts summarized in Chapter VII and some 
oe that seem valuable for the study and teaching of 
atin.

CHAPTER II 
WHAT ARE THE CHIEF MOTIVES THAT HAVE 
INFLUENCED HIGH-SCHOOL PUPILS 
TO CONTINUE LATIN? 
In curricula made up to a great extent of elective subjects 
of varying difficulty and value, the choosing of an exacting 
study like Latin depends probably upon reasons not very 
clearly defined in the mind of the pupil. But if he is to con- 
tinue the subject through four years, some very definite mo- 
tives and influences must operate to enable him to “carry 
on” to the end. 
It has been assumed and so stated! as “beyond question 
that by far the larger proportion of young people who take 
up the study of Latin do so because of their belief in its 
value as an instrument of general education and as a most 
valuable means toward acquiring a better use of the English 
language,” but no extensive study has been made hereto- 
fore to determine to what extent this assumption is really 
true. Table I, following, contains all the reasons given by 
8,600 pupils for continuing Latin through four years and 
the number and percentage of pupils who gave each reason. 
The reasons are listed in the order of their frequency. The 
letters indicate the order of the reasons as they appeared in 
the questionnaire. 
Several facts of importance are revealed by the following 
table. The average number of reasons given by each pupil is 
8.14. Very few pupils gave one reason only; most of them 
gave two or three; a few gave five or six. It is impossi- 
ble to know just which of the motives operating in a given 
case were most powerful; but regarding all motives as of 
equal qualitative importance for influencing the continua- 
tion of the subject, it is seen that on the basis of frequency 
the following are the outstanding reasons: (1) “I had to 
have it for college entrance,” given by 47% of the pupils; 
(2) “I found it helped in English,” by 46.7%; and (3) “I 
believed that the study furnished good mental training,” by 
46.6%. From this it is evident that entrance requirements 
of liberal-arts colleges, while not as rigid as formerly,?

*Walter E. Foster, Preliminary Report of the Committee on Ancient Languages, 
Bureau of Education Bulletin (1913), No. 41, p. 39, says: “Speaking broadly, in shap- 
ing our courses in Latin in secondary schools, we have approached our problems with 
college-entrance requirements and the interests of Latin chiefly in mind. In planning 
the work of the first two years, at least, one should but vaguely remember, if not en- 
tirely forget, that there are colleges and college-entrance requirements. All of us 
Latin teachers should constantly remind ourselves that, like the Sabbath, Latin was 
made for man and not man for Latin. The rigid entrance requirements still tend to 
cripple and limit the effectiveness of the high school.”

*In the main the data given in Table I are confirmed by the Swan study, based 
upon answers returned by 505 college freshmen from twenty-four colleges, who were studying Latin for the fifth year. There are, however, two notable discrepancies. In this study “I liked Latin” and “I expected to teach Latin” were checked by 35.9% and 5.7% of the pupils as representing causes a continuing the subject. In the Swann study these were indicated by 57% and 27%. The reasons for this discrepancy seem obvious to the writer. It is reasonable to suppose that those who liked the sub- ject especially and who expected to teach it would make up a large part of the fresh- men Latin classes in college, or, at least, these two classes of students would be larger in college than in high school. See Ruth Swan, Content and Method in High-School Latin, a master’s thesis in Indiana University (1924) ; quoted in General Report of the Classical Investigation (1924), pp. 74-7. 7All percentages in this study are figured to the nearest tenth of one per cent. ©) See Table II, p. 16.

Motives for Continuing Latin 15 
still exert a great influence in determining the subjects to 
be pursued in high school, even though only a relatively 
small number go to college and university. The old notion 
of mental training,? whether sound or not, is also an impor- 
tant factor in the minds of both pupils and teachers. This 
is further verified by the replies to 4 and 8, Table I, which 
in a way relate to the same thing as reason 3. It is also 
quite apparent that even from the pupils’ viewpoint much is 
being attempted toward making Latin function in the field 
of English, and that the pupils are conscious of the value of 
Latin as a means to a better understanding of their mother 
tongue. The objectives for the study of Latin as given by 
teachers of Latin point to the same conclusion. Many lead- 
8General Report of the Classical Investigation conducted by the Advisory Commit- tee of the American Classical League (1924), p. 56: “If these mental traits can be 
developed through the study of Latin, and if their spread to other situations and ex- periences can be effected, then the importance of this objective for all pupils who are studying Latin is obvious. Practically all the psychologists who contributed to the 
symposium on disciplinary objectives in the study of Latin expressed the opinion that these traits, if developed in the study of Latin, are subject to spread. This indicates a very marked change in the opinion of psychologists during the-last twenty years. Practically all these psychologists, including those who believe that there is some auto- matic transfer, are agreed that the extent and amount of this transfer can be in- 
creased in proportion to the extent to which favorable conditions as to method are 
provided.” 4(a) Alice D. Hare, An Evaluation of Objectives in Teaching of Latin, Classical Journal (1923), Vol. XIX, pp. 155-165, says in conclusion: “The composite judgment 
of the 300 secondary and college teachers may be summarized as follows: “1, An important value of Latin lies in the contribution it may make to the mas- tery of English (Objectives 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7). “2. The value for mental training and the development of habits that make for greater efficiency is insisted on by the high standing of Objectives 5, 18, and 19. “3. As the pupil’s knowledge of the language increases, attention should be directed to the cultural value of the subject. By a study of history, politics, social problems, and literature of the Romans he should enlarge his knowledge of life and gain some conception of the part Rome has played in the civilization of the world (Objectives 11, 18, and 17). “4. Some additional objectives important for the four-year course are 14, 15, and 16. Here the pupil’s literary sense should be developed.” 
For a complete discussion of these objectives, see the General Report of the Classical Investigation (1924), Chapter III. (b) Judd, Psychology of High-School Subjects (1915), p. 424: “Those who have 
opposed the doctrine of formal discipline by saying that’ the school subjects at the present time do not give a generalized training are undoubtedly criticizing, not the human mind, but our methods of instruction.” Again, p. 450: “It may be said that very few teachers, to say nothing of students, 
are trained to look for the applications of their subjects.” 
Also, p. 421: ‘The application of a body of information to a particular situation has sometimes been regarded as psychologically identical in character with the posses- sion of this information. Application is, however, a most difficult mental process and 
needs to be learned, just as the original principle itself has to be learned.” Again, p. 421: “Knowledge which is being used in applications, either in the evolu- tion of higher thought-processes or in the solution of practical problems, is not for- mal.” (c) Gray, Supplementary Lessons in English and Latin (1917), p. 6, says: “The processes must be conscious, constantly tending on repetition to become unconscious. 
Assignments should involve not simply the injunction to get a certain lesson, but to get it in a certain way; and the advance assignments should be furnished with con- stant guideposts calling the attention of the pupil to the necessity of correct habits 
of study.” (d) H. C. Nutting, Taking the Measure of Latin, Classical Journal (1923), Vol. XIX, p. 95, has a word of warning here that is perhaps timely. He says: “In con- clusion, it should be noted that the measuring program for Latin inevitably skirts closely ‘the danger of bringing into undue prominence certain measurable by-products and of losing sight of the high ideal of Latin as an end in itself.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  16 Content and Method in High-School Latin 
ers in advanced methods of Latin study and teaching have 
for some time been advocating the practical application of 
Latin to English. Studies showing this value have been 
made, and, in general, teachers have accepted the notion of 
application as a valuable and important part of Latin teach- 
ing. Yet there are evidences from the data considered in 
this study that they have done little in the way of con- 
sciously trying to render the mastery of Latin more thor- 
ough and interesting by relating the subject to the life and 
thought of the pupil.* 
Of the 1,682 students checking reason 2, “I found it helped 
in English,” 1,164 gave some definite phase of English in 
which they felt that Latin had been especially helpful. The 
following table represents the distribution of the replies:

°(a) B. L. Ullman, Latin of the Future, Classical Journal (1918), Vol. XIV, p. 310, 
says: “Our teaching of Latin for its own sake has suffered in the past from lack of 
emphasis on these points. A correction of this weakness will have the double advan- 
tage of helping Latin and English.” 
Again, p. 311: “But it is not enough to select the best vocabulary ; it is also neces- 
sary to teach the student how to use the Latin as a help to English.” 
(b) See also students’ methods of studying vocabulary, Table XXI, and type of 
questions asked by teachers, Table XXV. 
(c) Studies made by Thorndike, Ruger, Haskell, Hamblen, and others show that 
Latin pupils make an average growth in different types of English work that is inva- 
riably greater than that made by non-Latin pupils with the same initial ability. In 
the knowledge of English words derived from Latin the average growth of Latin 
pupils was two and one-half times greater than that made by their non-Latin class- 
mates. It was also shown that “by conscious adaptation of material and method a 
superior gain can be secured over that made by non-Latin pupils three times greater 
than is the case when no special effort” is made to have Latin function in the in- 
creased knowledge of English words. See General Report oj the Classical Investiga- 
tion (1924), p. 42, and E. L. Thorndike and S. J. Ruger, The Effect of First-Year

Motives for Continuing Latin 17 
The pupil evidently feels that the chief emphasis in this 
connection is being placed on derivative work in English, 
with some attention to the bearing of Latin upon English 
grammar. It may be true, however, that little really sys- 
tematic effort is being put forth to make Latin function in 
any field and that help referred to above is more or less in- 
cidental. 
Of the 1,175 students checking Table I, 6, “I found it 
helped in the study of other languages,” 916 gave a particu- 
lar language in which they felt that Latin was of material 
help. The languages and the number of pupils naming each 
are presented in the following table:

It is impossible to tell just how many of the 3,600 Latin 
pupils replying to the questionnaire have had one or more 
modern foreign tongues. Hence, it cannot be determined 
what percentage the number of pupils in Table III, who 
feel that Latin has been of special help to them in learning 
modern foreign languages, is of the total number of high- 
school pupils studying such languages.7 It is clear, how- 
ever, that the pupils are at least beginning to recognize this 
as one of the distinct values to be derived from Latin study.* 
“Believed four years’ study of the same subject a good 
thing” was given by 36 per cent of-the pupils as one of the 
reasons which caused them to continue. In these days of 
free electives and “snap courses” it is.interesting to find that 
more than one-third of this group say they believe in the 
superior educative value of a study continuing over a series   
7General Report of the Classical Investigation (1924), p. 52: “The Schenck study 
shows that of 10,435 pupils who entered high school in 1914, 1915, and 1917 and began 
the study of Latin, 42 per cent studied French, 13 per cent studied Spanish, and 26 
per cent studied German during their high-school course.” These percentages have 
been changed somewhat since 1917, but definite informaton is not available. 
SH. C. Nutting, in General Discipline and the Study of Latin, School and Society 
(1917), Vol. V, p. 262: “Take, for example, the improvement in handling the study 
of Latin as a means of preparation for the acquisition of a romance language. This 
very important possibility is just beginning to be consciously developed, though the 
fact has all along been clear that for a person who knows Latin it is especially easy to 
take up French, for example.”

4, Table I, as has already been pointed out. 
More than one-third (35.9%) say that a liking for Latin 
was one of the determining factors in this connection. It 
can be safely inferred that the greater part of those contin- 
uing the subject liked it, but many may not have felt that 
this was one of the controlling reasons for going through 
the full four years. Of the 1,292 students checking 5, Ta- 
ble I, “I liked Latin, and especially liked______ 37.924. or 
71%, of those checking this reason gave some phase of the 
work which appealed to them or some writer whom they 
liked especially. The data follow:

The data in Table IV are significant here only because they 
seem to verify the more important figures found in Chapter 
IV (pages 24-37) of this study, relating to the relative pop- 
ularity of Latin writers. 
Approximately one-fifth of the pupils regarded the advice 
of parents and teachers as important in determining 
whether or not they should continue the subject. The num- 
ber is relatively small, but this influence when operating 
was doubtless a very strong one. 
It is interesting to note that only 15.8% claim as an influ- 
ence that Latin was easier than some other subjects,!° and 
only 4.2% say that it was the easiest of all their subjects. This 
shows that pupils evidently do not take the subject because 
it affords opportunity for making credits with the expendi- 
ture of a minimum amount of time and effort, and that when 
pupils like Latin and believe in its value they are willing to 
devote even more time to it than to most other high-school 
subjects. (See Table XV and discussion, pages 33, 34.) 
The replies given by the 171 pupils in 14, Table I, are too 
varied to be of much value. They are: needed it for voca- 
tion, 97;11 culture, 16; liked teacher, 15; help in English

Summary of Motives for Continuing Latin.—It is evident, 
then, that certain influences clearly defined in the thinking 
of pupils are active in causing them to continue their Latin 
throughout their high-school course of study. The most 
conspicuous of these motives or influences, named in the 
order of their frequency, are: college-entrance require- 
ments, given by 47% of the pupils; value of Latin for Eng- 
lish, 46.7% ; belief in the value of Latin for mental training, 
46.6% ; belief in the value of a subject pursued over a long 
period of time, 36.3% ; a liking for the subject, 35.9% ; value 
of Latin as a basis for foreign modern-language study, 
32.6% ; combined influence of parents and teachers, 11.3%. 
Stated differently, of all the influences operating to induce 
high-school pupils to continue Latin, 75% comes from the 
above seven sources, as claimed by these high-school pupils 
themselves.

CHAPTER III 
WHY DO STUDENTS DISCONTINUE LATIN? 
In Chapter II it was shown that certain motives, more or 
less definite, for the continuation of Latin exist in the minds 
of pupils. There are reasons or causes no less definite and 
powerful that have induced some of their classmates, who 
began at the same time and usually under the same circum- 
stances as they, to drop the subject at the end of one, two, 
or three years of the study. In the questionnaire’ to high- 
school seniors those who did go on were asked to give the 
reasons why some of their friends in Latin classes with 
them had not continued the subject. Their replies are listed 
below in the order of their relative importance as deter- 
mined by the number of times each reason appears:

Reasons for Dropping Latin 21 
lapping that could not be avoided in the tabulations. There 
are, however, a few well-defined causes that stand out very 
prominently. In addition, there are a number of causes less 
conspicuous, but important on the whole, since they help to 
give a comprehensive notion of practically all possible causes 
contributing to the pupil’s discontinuance of the subject. 
Out of the total number of pupils replying, 1,996, or 
55.6%, say that the difficulty of the subject caused their 
classmates to drop Latin. It is evident from the pupils’ 
answers that not only those who felt that the subject was so 
difficult they could not master it are included in this group, 
but also those who for one reason or another were looking 
for easy subjects and dropped Latin because it was disap- 
pointing in this respect. The replies indicate, too, that this 
reason of difficulty refers to students who, finding Cesar 
hard and thinking that the subject would increase in diffi- 
culty, but not in interest, preferred not to endanger their 
grades by continuing. Some probably discovered that if 
they as juniors should stop Latin and begin French or Span- 
ish, they would find the study comparatively easy and would 
save considerable time in a class of freshmen with less ma- 
turity and less training than they. For those who are lazy 
or of mediocre ability, for those who do not plan to go to 
college, and for those who are not at all sure of the value of 
Latin, the reason, ‘‘too hard,” might be the only excuse 
needed to justify themselves in dropping the subject. The 
chief factor in determining whether or not any course is 
satisfactory in the eyes of the average pupil is the extent to 
which he is gaining a feeling of mastery of the subject. 
Dissatisfaction in this connection, and the elective system 
helps to account for the great number of students who drop 
Latin at the end of one or two years. (See footnote 4, 
page 22.) 
Closely related to the cause of “difficulty” and next to it 
in importance are two others: (b) “They did not like the 
study” (which often means that they simply preferred an- 
other subject), and (c) “It took too much time.” The pu- 
pils replying explain frequently by saying, “Too much time 
in proportion to benefit derived.” The replies also indicate 
that many of those who discontinued the study of Latin felt 
that it did not leave enough time for their other subjects, 
for recreation, and for social life. This is really a serious 
cause. It takes a great deal of faith and courage to stay at 
home and work on a Latin lesson when one’s schoolmates 
are taking subjects which allow leisure for shows, parties,
-P-A-G-E-22
ne eet ee ee 
22} Content and Method in High-School Latin 
and social life in general, and which yet gain the same cred- 
its as Latin.” 
It is difficult to know which of the above reasons are ef- 
fects and which causes; but, no doubt, the inherent difficulty 
of Latin and the ground to be covered are in many cases 
responsible for both the excessive amount of time required 
in preparation and also for dislike of the subject. Adults 
are hardly equal to such ulterior returns for strenuous ef- 
fort, and much less must be expected of high-school boys and 
girls. Regarding all causes given as of equal value, the 
first three named represent 57.8% of the influences which 
caused high-school pupils to drop Latin as stated by their 
friends who continued the subject. This does not overlook 
the fact, however, that back of these reasons there may be a 
poor teacher who assigns an excessive amount of work or 
has little ability or inclination to make the study attractive 
and worth while to the student. Eliminating the few who 
are mentally incapable of mastering a difficult subject and 
those who are too lazy to apply themselves with energy to 
any task, the teacher*® rather than the subject may be re- 
sponsible for the relatively large number that drop Latin 
early in the course.* 
An appreciable number drop Latin because of a feeling 
that it has no value, or that its value is out of proportion to 
its cost in time and effort, as shown by the fact that 14.3% 
of the pupils gave this as a cause for dropping Latin. 
A considerable number are eliminated by changing their 
courses or by taking courses in which four full years of 
Latin are impossible. An equal number gave failure to pass 
as a reason. 
As given by pupils, it is seen, therefore, that the most 
important reasons which induce their classmates to drop 
Latin are: the difficulty of the subject; dislike for the sub- 
ject ; excessive time required for its preparation; failure to

preparation of lessons.

appreciate its value.» These represent 66.2% of the total 
reasons given. Sixteen other causes represent the remain- 
ing 33.8%. Most important of these are: not room in 
course taken; lack of ability; laziness; poor foundation. 
Many of these are insignificant, considered separately ; but 
taken as a whole and in connection with the ones already 
mentioned, they represent influences discouraging to pupils 
wishing to include Latin in their high-school program. 
Many of these minor influences, as well as the more impor- 
tant ones, might be eliminated or greatly reduced by a reor- 
ganization of the Latin course and improvement in methods 
of instruction. The data presented in Chapters IV, V, and 
VI will suggest some needed remedies. 
Summary of Motives for Continuing and Reasons for 
Dropping Latin.—F rom the analysis of the foregoing data 
it is clear that (a) pupils continue Latin because of college- 
entrance requirements, a belief in its value for English and 
foreign languages, general mental training, a liking for the 
subject, and the influence of parents and others; (b) they 
drop it because it takes too much time, is too hard, they do 
not like it, or do not believe in its value.

same percentages, are thi ief causes for the dropping of Latin by high-school pupils.

The first three writers named were read by all pupils re- 
plying to the questionnaire. The number reading Ovid in- 
dicates quite an interest in this poet. The other authors 
are represented by rather small numbers, but they serve to 
show that attempts are being made to break away from the 
traditional course somewhat and to find material more in- 
teresting for the student, especially in the second year. 
Preference for Authors.—Of much more significance than 
what the pupils read is their relative interest in different 
parts of the reading course as now organized. One of the 
fundamental problems connected with the teaching of any 
subject is to determine what content will best provide condi- 
tions most favorable for the maximum realization of the 
objectives determined upon as valid for the study of that 
subject. This was one of the problems definitely and system- 
atically attacked by the Classical Investigation ;! and with 
the hope that additional information of a very valuable na- 
ture would be secured, the problem was carried to the high-

school pupil through the present special study. It cannot 
be supposed that the choice of material for classroom study 
should be determined entirely by the preference of those 
who are studying the subject rather than in accordance with 
accepted standards or the larger outlook for the subject. 
If this should be the sole guide at all times, the material 
selected might come to be that making least demands on the 
pupil and in the long run affording a minimum of intellectual 
growth. This does not seem to be true of the pupils under 
consideration, however, for Table I shows that the ease with 
which they could master Latin was the least influential of 
all motives which caused them to continue the study. Table 
XV also shows that the author (Vergil) ranked first in point 
of interest by the pupils is just the one on whom they spent 
the most time in the preparation of their lesson assign- 
ments. If it should turn out that what the pupil prefers is 
opposed to what he ought to prefer, of course the choice can- 
not be left to him. Yet, at any rate, the heavy mortality? 
in the Latin classes of the secondary schools suggests that 
we neglect no possible avenue of approach to this problem, 
that the causes may be discovered and appropriate remedies 
applied.* Psychology has shown the value of motivation 
and interest as a means of winning the codperation and best 
efforts of the pupils, and it seems that we cannot afford to 
risk losing our students in their first taste of Latin litera- 
ture by ignoring entirely their interests in this regard. The 
time has come when it should be asked in connection with the 
Latin authors read: ‘‘Why these?” “Why not others?”

preferences of the high-school pupils replying to this ques- 
tion. The figures at the head of the columns indicate the

years by all committees which have investigated the question.”

The data in this table are very illuminating, especially in 
connection with the three authors usually read in high 
school—Ceesar, Cicero, and Vergil. First place is given to 
Vergil by 69.9% of all students checking this author. This 
is more than three times the number giving first preference 
to Cesar and Cicero combined. Second place is granted to 
Cicero by nearly one and one-half times as many as give this 
ranking to Cesar. It is not till the third place is reached 
that we find Cesar taking the lead in the percentage of stu- 
dents preferring him. Cicero is also conspicuous in the 
third rank, being placed here by 35.8% of the pupils. The 
number ranking Vergil below first place is so small as to 
have little significance. It should be pointed out that on the 
basis of the number reading Ovid (1,354, or 37.6%) he is 
more popular than Cesar or Cicero, being placed in both 
first and second places more frequently than either of the 
other two.. Adding the percentages in first and second places, 
the writers are represented thus: Vergil, given by 92.1%; 
Ovid, 63.1% ; Cicero, 50.8%; and Cesar, 35% of all those 
including each of these writers in their replies and giving 
them first or second rank. The data for the other writers 
are of little value, since so few pupils had read them. 
Based on the teachers’ judgment of these pupils’ interest 
in the various writers, we have the data in Table VIII:+

Tables VII and VIII show remarkable agreement in the 
rankings made by pupils and their teachers of the four Latin 
writers usually read in high school. There is some dis- 
agreement in the case of Cesar and Cicero, notably in first 
and third places, where the percentages are reversed. If, 
however, the percentages for first and second places are 
added, it is seen that there is close agreement in the reac- 
tion of pupils and the judgment of their teachers. The next 
table will show this.

The data point unmistakably to the following conclusions: 
Of the three writers read by all pupils, Vergil is preémi- 
nently first choice, with Cicero second, but far behind Ver- 
gil, while Cesar takes a third place considerably below Cic- 
ero. If Ovid is included, the order is: Vergil, Ovid, Cicero, 
Cesar. On the basis of the pupils’ interest, then, the second 
year is the conspicuously weak spot in Latin reading, and 
the fourth year the strongest.® 
What are the explanations of this? The next table shows 
the reasons which pupils give for their preference of the 
author which they put first. Many pupils gave more than 
one reason, and all are tabulated. Only the figures relat- 
ing to Cesar, Cicero, Vergil, and Ovid are included. The 
data for the other authors have little or no value.

The reasons are varied, and there seems to be more or

most certainly including “easy,” “style,” “subject-matter” 
in his answer. All of the terms in Table X were in the re- 
plies and have been tabulated just as given. Although 
there is a repetition of reasons, yet the tabulation exhibits 
the combined sources of the pupils’ interest in certain writ- 
ers. The reason, “interesting,” leads all the others, being 
indicated as 37.4% of all reasons given for assigning first 
place to Cesar, 27.5% for Cicero, 42.5% for Vergil, and 
53.6% for Ovid. Counting each reason every time it occurs, 
there is a total of 4,614 occurrences of the seven reasons 
given for first preference of all authors. Of this number, 
1,898, or 41.1%, of all pupils give “interest; 1,184, or 
25.6%, give “subject-matter ;” 626, or 13.5%, give “style;” 
and 482, or 10.4%, indicate “easy” as the reason for first 
rank in their preferences. 
It will also be noted that the number of reasons given and 
the total number of times these occur indicate that Vergil 
not only has a much stronger, but also a much wider, inter- 
est for pupils than is the case with the other authors. This 
undoubtedly accounts for the overwhelming preference for 
Vergil as shown in Tables VII and VIII (pages 26, 27). 
From the presentation and analysis of the foregoing data 
it is evident that the interest which high-school pupils feel 
in the different parts of the reading course is due largely to 
what an author has to say and the way in which he says it, 
rather than to the ease with which the author may be mas- 
tered or the assigned tasks in that author met.

Since in Table X it was found that the principal reasons 
why pupils preferred certain authors were “interest,” 
“subject-matter,” “style,” and “ease of mastery,” one would 
expect the converse to be true relative to those writers placed 
last in the order of preference. This is the case in general, 
but the question of “style” seems to figure but little here, 
while “difficult” takes third place as a reason for placing 
certain authors last. ‘Monotonous” is given as a reason 
373 times, 348 of which relate to Cesar. This reason should 
probably have been included with “‘not interesting ;’”’ but since 
the number was so conspicuous, it was thought best to enter 
it as a separate reason. The total number of occurrences of 
reasons given is 3,414. Combining “did not like” or “not 
interesting” and “monotonous,” the order is: “not interest- 
ing,” given by 1,474 (43.1%) of the pupils; “subject-mat- 
ter,” 865 (25.04%) ; “difficult,” 800 (23.4%) ; “style,” 105 
(3.07%). If the first three reasons are combined, we have 
represented 91.5% of all the reasons given by pupils for 
putting writers last. 
It is quite evident, then, that the nature of the content of 
the writers, the manner in which the subject-matter is set 
forth, and the difficulty that the students experience in its 
mastery, are largely responsible for the comparatively small 
interest which pupils feel in some parts of the reading course 
in Latin. Is there not an urgent need for a reorganization

Easy Reading Material—For a number of years it has 
been felt by those best qualified to judge that the break be- 
tween the traditional first and second year’s work in Latin 
was too great and to an extent responsible for the difficulties 
encountered and resulting attitudes on the part of pupils. 
(See Chapter III.)*7 In order to bridge the gap between 
first and second-year Latin, various suggestions have been 
made as regards the subject-matter for this transition 
period. It is not the purpose of this study to review these 
here ;8 but some notion of the extent to which easier material 
for reading has been introduced and the interest of the pu- 
‘Walter E. Foster, Preliminary Report in Ancient Languages, United States Bu- 
reau of Education Bulletin (1913), No. 41, p. 36, says: “The first, as well as the sec- 
ond, year’s work is dull and difficult because we insist on reading Cesar in the second 
year. Elaborate analyses are made of the vocabulary and syntax of Cesar, and prac- 
tically all beginning books are crammed with these ‘essentials.’ The work of the first 
year is planned, not with reference to the capacities and interests of children, but 
with reference to the vocabulary and syntax of Cesar.” 
Again (p. 39): “If Latin is to maintain the high place it has occupied in our 
scheme of education for so many generations, the teaching of it must be more vital. In content, scope, and method, our courses must be adapted to the ability and to the 
interests of the children.” 
D’Ooge, The First Year of Latin, What and How, American Schoolmaster, Vol. VIII (October, 1915): “The reign of Czsar, so absolute in the second year, casts its shadow over the first year as well, and the sentences are disjecta membra of the great 
dictator. Here again the doctrine of interest has won but a partial victory.” 
The older notion of reading material for the second year is represented by Bennett, 
Teaching of Latin and Greek (1906), pp. 109-10: “The foregoing enumeration of books containing simple reading makes no pretense at completeness. There are nu- merous other books. Many suffer from the same objectionable features of unclassical Latin; others introduce modern or medieval subject-matter in a Latin dress. This last procedure seems a serious mistake. To the extent that we withdraw the student 
of Latin from the thoughts and ideas of ancient Rome, we are missing one important element of culture which ought to come from the study of Latin—namely, better un- derstanding of the present through an understanding of the past. This end is cer- tainly not reached by stories from the Arabian Nights or English history put in Latin form by modern scholars.” 
J.C. Kirtland, High-School Latin and College-Entrance Requirements: A Reply, Classical Journal, X (February, 1915), 232: “In my opinion, there is imperative need of reform in the work of the first two years of the course. It is now so hurried that it loses much of its immediate value and affords a poor preparation for further study. The teacher should have time to drill his class of beginners on new forms and con- structions until they have been thoroughly learned, adding to the exercises of the book 
as much as may be necessary; and there should be considerable reading of simple 
graded Latin—so simple that it can be read with a sense of mastery and so carefully 
graded as to give an opportunity for full consideration of each new difficulty. This means, of course, simplified or ‘made’ Latin, and doubtless entails, in the case of most high schools, a reduction in the reading of the canonical works.” Quoted in the 
General Report of the Classical Investigation (1924), p. 1 
See p. 25 of this study for statement from the General Report of the Classical In- 
vestigation (1924). 
™New York Syllabus for Ancient Languages (1919), p. 5: “To this end it is desir- able that the pupil should begin the reading of easy connected Latin at the earliest moment warranted by his knowledge of vocabulary and forms. Manifestly the selec- 
tions should be interesting and wholesome in character, and should be so graded as to be well within the range of his ability to understand and to interpret at the different stages of his study.” See General Report of the Classical Investigation (1924), p. 101: “Of the teachers filling out the general questionnaire, 91 per cent would read some easy or ‘made’ Latin before taking up the first classical author ; and of these, 97 per cent would have this material deal with classical themes.” See ibid. pp. 124ff for criteria in selecting easy reading material, and pp. 144ff for recommendations.

pils in this type of Latin may be gained from Table XII,

such as fables, myths, stories?” and (b) “Did you like this

A glance at the data shows that much is being attempted 
in the way of providing suitable material for this period 
in the Latin course. Of the 3,499 pupils replying to this 
question, 2,009, or 57%, say that they have read some con- 
nected Latin before beginning Cesar. Of the 318 teachers 
giving information on this point, 236 (74%) say they have 
their pupils read some material of this kind before begin- 
ning Cesar.? There is a noticeable variation between the 
pupils’ and teachers’ answers. This could be due to two 
things: (a) so little is being done that the pupil fails to 
recall his experience in this connection after two or three 
years; (b) the teachers are perhaps answering in terms of 
what they do to-day, and it is probable that they are really 
‘doing more to select material for this period now than two 
or three years ago. It would seem that the pupils’ replies 
more nearly represent the real situation, and yet these an- 
swers may refer. to either a few paragraphs or a well- 
selected body of simple connected reading. The fact is 
clear, however, that much is really being done to provide 
graded reading lessons introductory to Cesar or other diffi- 
cult authors.

Out of the 2,009 pupils mentioned above, 1,890 replied 
to the question, “Did you like it better than Cesar?” and 
of the 1,890 replying, 1,300 (73.5%) say they did like this 
material better. Of the 236 teachers who have their pupils 
read something of this kind, 159 (70.3%) say that the pu- 
pils like it better than Cesar. The difference in the per- 
centages of teachers and pupils for this same item is not 
great, being only 3.2%. This information throws light on 
the data found in Tables VII, VIII, and IX relative to pref- 
erence for certain Latin writers. (See pages 26, 27.)

Table XIV (a) shows that ‘more interesting” repre- 
sents 52.1% of all reasons; ‘subject-matter,’ 26.1%; 
“because it was easier,” 21.6%. The reasons and the per- 
centages correspond closely to those given in connection 
with preference for authors (Table X). It is notable 
that here also it is “interest,” not ‘‘ease,” that makes the 
strongest appeal to the pupil. The teachers’ replies to the 
same question are not in agreement with those of the pupils. 
Note especially the figures with reference to “more inter- 
esting” and “easier” as reasons for their pupils’ liking this 
easy material more than Cesar. 
Reasons for liking the easy reading less than Cesar, 
Table XIV (b), occur 330 times in the pupils’ replies. Of 
these, “It was less interesting” represents 44.5% of all rea-  
-P-A-G-E-33

sons ; “It was not connected,” 25.1% ;!° “It was less valuable,” 
21.2%; “It was more difficult than Cesar,” 9%. Too few 
of the teachers (only 31) replied to this question for their 
answers to be of decisive value. But the agreement with 
respect to “less interesting” is notable, and it should be 
pointed out that 45.1% of those replying give “unreal” or 
“not true” as a cause for their pupils’ liking the easy read- 
ing less than Cesar. 
In summary form the data relative to easy reading mate- 
rial reveal the following facts: 
1. More than half of the high-school pupils—57.4% ac- 
cording to pupils and 74.2% according to their teachers— 
are reading selections of this kind. 
2. More than 68% of these like the easy reading material 
better than Ceesar. 
3. The reasons for liking it better are found in an easier 
and more interesting subject-matter. 
Doubtless something is lost in “made Latin” by lessening 
the intimate contact with the ancient world, its language 
and literature. But evidences! point to the conclusion that 
there should be an abundance of easy and interesting mate- 
rial at hand from the beginning, and pupils should read a 
very much larger amount even in the first year than is now 
the custom.'” 
Time Required for Preparation—In Table II it was 
pointed out that the third most important cause for the 
discontinuance of Latin by high-school pupils was the great 
amount of time required for preparation of the assign- 
ments. The figures given below are illuminating with re- 
spect to the actual time in minutes spent in preparation of 
lessons in the different years.

The data in Table XV represent a wide range in the amount 
of time spent by individual pupils in preparation of the Latin 
assignments in all years. The averages and medians indi- 
cate, however, that the extremely short and very long pe- 
riods are relatively few in number. By actual count there 
are only 44 (1.4%) of the pupils who give a period shorter 
than thirty minutes as the time required for preparation of 
a lesson in Cesar; in Cicero, 41 (1.3%) ; and in Vergil, 46 
(1.4%). In Cesar 6.2% of pupils say they spent in prep- 
aration 90 minutes or more; in Cicero, 10.5% ; and in Ver- 
gil, 12.8%. 
A study made by W. H. Uhl, based on reports from 85,000 
pupils in 177 schools located in 41 states, shows that the 
average time spent by pupils is 57.9 minutes for the first 
year, 56 for the second, 59.9 for the third, and 64.7 for the 
fourth These averages are for schools in which there 
is no supervised study. The averages for schools with su- 
pervised study are, on the whole, about 10 minutes lower 
for Latin; but they are still in excess of the average time 
required by other subjects. Stated in another way, on the 
basis of the estimate of the pupils under consideration in 
the writer’s study, a four-year course of Latin requires on 
the average approximately 715 hours of outside preparation. 
Mr. Uhl found it to be approximately 725 hours. The 
Uhl study also shows that an equal number of credits can 
be earned in other subjects by an expenditure of only about 
450 to 480 hours. 
The demands for economy of time in education are so 
urgent that this problem of time needs careful attention. 
If Latin takes more time for successful preparation than is 
required by other subjects, the teachers of Latin will have 
to show convincing reasons for this extra expenditure of 
time. Two questions need to be raised at this point: (a) 
Can it be demonstrated that the value of Latin is sufficiently 
greater than that of other subjects to warrant greater time? 
(b) Are other subjects demanding an amount of time and 
effort sufficient to warrant the credit given? 
Translations—Translations, or “ponies,” have for a long 
time been regarded as a great handicap to effective Latin 
teaching. It is difficult even for the experienced teacher 
to know always to what extent such helps are being used by 
his pupils, and it is hard to eliminate them. The pupils’ 
answers to the question, “About how many pupils in your 
class, if any, used translations?” were somewhat unsatis- 
factory, because the number given did not indicate the per-

centage of the class using the “ponies.” Yet the informa- 
tion as tabulated below is highly significant, for it shows 
certain interesting and important tendencies.

It will be noticed that the number of instances in which 
pupils say no translations were used represents more than 
half of the replies in the case of Cesar and of Cicero, and 
more than two-thirds in the case of Vergil. Comparatively 
few pupils say the whole class used them. Of the replies, 
82.5% to 95.7% indicate that helps were either not used at 
all or else used by a very few pupils. The decrease in their 
use in the fourth year—as shown by the percentages already 
pointed out—is quite noticeable. This is, doubtless, due to 
two things: the elimination of most of those who either 
could not or were not willing to do the work themselves, 
and to the greater interest in the subject. It has been 
shown in Table VII that Vergil was given first place by 
more than three times as many pupils as gave first prefer- 
ence to Czsar and Cicero combined. The decrease in the 
use of “ponies” in the fourth year cannot be due to decrease 
in the time required for preparation of assignments, for 
Table XV shows that the average time required for Vergil 
is considerably greater than for Cesar or Cicero. The 
fact that fewer pupils admitted that any translations at all 
were used in Vergil probably points also to a decrease in 
the use of translations in this year. 
The teachers’ estimate of the use of translations is not given 
by years, and is, for this reason, not as valuable as that of the 
pupils. It is, on the whole, much higher than that given by 
pupils. Only 21.2% say none of their pupils used them, as 
opposed to an average of 59.2% of pupils as shown by their 
replies. If the average of the replies giving “none” and “few” 
combined is considered, the percentages agree more closely, 
being 34.9 and 41.2 for teachers and pupils, respectively. 
There is also close agreement with respect to “several” or 
“many,” the teachers’ estimate here being 3% higher than
-P-A-G-E-36
  36 Content and Method in High-School Latin 
that of the pupils. Practically no teachers or pupils admit 
the universal use of translations in their classes. 
The writer is inclined to believe that the pupils’ estimates 
given above are more nearly correct, and that the teachers’ 
answers are in many cases mere guesses. If the teachers’ 
judgment represents the real situation, then there is even 
greater need for improvement in the content and method 
of the early years of the Latin course than is indicated by 
the estimates given by pupils alone. 
Summary of Authors Read.—The data relative to the pu- 
pils’ interest in different parts of the reading course justify 
the following conclusions: 
1. Vergil is by far the most popular and Cesar quite the 
least popular of the four authors read extensively in high 
school. 
2. The chief reasons for the special interest felt in certain 
writers are found almost wholly in the character of the 
subject-matter as regards content and style. The ease with 
which the Latin is translated seems to have little to do with 
the choice.1+ (See pp. 25-29, 33ff.) 
3. The principal reasons why certain authors are put last 
in the order of preference are based on difficult and unin- 
teresting subject-matter. These reasons apply mainly to 
Cesar and Cicero, but in particular to Cesar, since these 
stand far below Vergil and Ovid in interest, as shown by 
the replies of the 3,600 pupils and by the judgment of their 
teachers. 
4. Quite extensive use is being made of easy reading ma- 
terial for translation before taking up Cesar; 57.4% of 
the pupils and 74.2% of the teachers say the pupils read 
something of this kind. Of the pupils, 68.7% say they liked 
this easy material better than Cesar. The percentage for 
the teachers is only .6 greater. The reasons given for 
greater interest refer to easier and more interesting subject- 
matter as compared with Ceesar.!* 
5. The amount of time spent in preparation of Latin as- 
signments is somewhat greater than that devoted to other 
high-school subjects.1° 
6. The use of “ponies” is quite prevalent, but perhaps not 
alarmingly so. Their use seems to be confined to a rela-

tively small number, and, according to the pupils, greatly 
decreases in the fourth year. This is due probably to the 
elimination of poorer pupils and to the greatly increased 
interest in Vergil. The number using “ponies” could, no 
doubt, be materially decreased in all years by a modification 
of methods of reading Latin’? and the character of the 
content in the second and third years.18

  CHAPTER V 
WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPAL METHODS WHICH 
PUPILS EMPLOY IN THE PREPARATION 
OF THEIR LESSONS? 
One of the most difficult practices for the pupil to acquire 
is systematic methods of study. He is not likely to develop 
proper methods of procedure in his preparation of lessons 
in any subject unless carefully and continuously directed 
by the teacher during a considerable period of time. Even 
if this is done, there is likely to be quite a difference be- 
tween what the pupil is actually doing and what the teacher 
thinks he is or ought to be doing. It seems natural for the 
pupil to follow the line of least resistance and in his prac- 
tices tend to fall below the method in which he is being 
trained by the instructor. Of course, method is not a sys- 
tem of hard and fast rules that must be adhered to under 
all circumstances; but there are certain general lines of 
procedure that should be followed if the objectives set up 
for any subject are to be attained with maximum results 
for the pupil.t 
The methods which high-school pupils think they are fol- 
lowing in the preparation of an assigned passage of Latin? 
and those which their teachers say their pupils are taught 
to follow are set forth by the data presented in Tables 
XVII to XXII. The data will be discussed under the fol- 
1Gray, Supplementary Lessons in High-School English and Latin (1917): “The disciplinary value of Latin is a product of the method of study. Observe that it is ‘method of study,’ not ‘method of teaching.’ The methods adopted by the teacher to create a knowledge of Latin are of no training value except so far as they produce corresponding methods of study. Upon the development of sound habits of study, permanent and general in their effect upon the mind of the pupil, the utmost empha- sis is laid. The methods selected should be permanent—i. e., they should be such as can be used in all the remainder of the Latin course and in any other foreign language or in English. They should also be conscious—i. e., pupils should grasp explicitly how each element in the day’s lesson should be attacked, and be able not merely under the tuition of the teacher to arrive at a solution, but to ask his own questions and solve the problem independently by the correct method. But as material is more tangible than method, in that proportion must the emphasis in the class upon method be stronger till there is created some confidence that the pupil, when he studies his Latin lesson, will find himself confronted not simply with the injunction, ‘Do this,’ but just as insistently by the injunction, ‘Do this in this way.’ ” Judd, Psychology of High-School Subjects (1915), p. 245, says: “Finally, in order to make perfectly clear the psychological conclusion of the whole matter, let it be explicitly pointed out that there is no single best method of teaching foreign lan- guages. The method must vary with the purpose and maturity of the students.” Again, p. 437: “Most teachers do not realize that good students need help in method of work. The result is that a teacher, confronted with a class which he has met that morning in a Latin recitation and told that his duty in this second period is to teach, not Latin, but the methods of study, stands dumb and embarrassed. If some one fails in a Latin construction, this teacher can tell him the correct construction ; if some one uses a clumsy Latin phrase, the teacher knows Latin enough to suggest improvement. When it comes to improving mental processes, how different the case! The teacher has little training.” 2For the assignment used as a basis for the methods discussed in this and the fol- lowing chapter, see Part III of the “Question Blank on Content_and Method,” p. 83.

Preliminary Steps——To prevent study from concerning 
itself with the mere acquisition of isolated fragments of 
knowledge, good teaching attempts to connect each recita- 
tion with previous recitations and to project each lesson 
into what is to follow. Table XVII presents the facts in 
this connection as obtained from replies of 3,580 pupils and 
329 of their teachers.

  The figures indicate that most of the pupils checked only 
one of the three suggested preliminary steps. Less than 
half say they connected the present lesson with what had 
gone before as a preliminary step in lesson preparation. 
(See 1, Table XVII.) About one-fourth tried to infer what 
would follow in the new lesson, while 29.3% made no effort 
to connect the new lesson with what had gone before. The 
percentage of teachers who say they teach pupils to follow 
these steps is very much higher than that given by the pu- 
pils. Evidently the instructions are for some reason not 
being followed in nearly half the cases. 
Methods of Attacking the Latin Sentence.—It is a self- 
evident fact that in the study of any foreign language the 
ability to read that language with a reasonable degree of 
ease and pleasure is of fundamental importance for the   
‘Bennett & Bristol, The Teaching of Latin and Greek (1906), pp. 183-134: ‘As 
regards the subject-matter of authors read, I believe our secondary schools quite gen- 
erally make one very serious omission. They fail to emphasize the importance of 
grasping the narrative or argument of a writer in its continuity. The tendency is to 
read simply from day to day. Too little effort—often none at all—is made to bring 
successive lessons into relation, to show the bearings and connection of the different 
parts of a narrative or speech. How few pupils after reading a book of Cesar or 
an oration of Cicero have in their minds any clear and consistent picture of the course 
of thought, the line of argument, its strength and defects, or apprehend the real drift 
of the piece as a whole! Is not the piece commonly made a succession of ‘takes,’ the 
order of which might be varied ad libitum, so far as concerns interference with any 
systematic endeavor to show their organic connection? And is not the impression 
left upon the minds of pupils often one of utter vagueness as to what it is all about? 
I believe the alleged defect to be very general; and if it is, it surely ought to be reme- 
died at once.”

4Lee Byrne, Syntax of High-School Latin (1918 edition), p. 4, in concluding his 
discussion of aims in the teaching of Latin. says: “I think few will seriously dispute 
that this central aim is to be found in learning to read and in reading Latin itself. 
I mean this in a broad way to include the process which is, in a strict sense, reading 
the Latin as Latin, just as one reads an English book as English, and also to include 
the process which some say is all that we can ever attain—the turning of the Latin 
into English through translation.”

larger returns in power, speed, and pleasure than others. 
Even if there were several methods® of equal value, the 
pupils should be made conscious of the method used and 
should be trained through practice to use this method in the 
independent preparation of their lesson assignments. Any 
method consistently followed is better than no method. It 
should also be pointed out here that the act of translating 
is not the same as reading proper, though the two processes 
may have many common characteristics ;° and there is, no 
doubt, much confusion on the part of both pupils and teach- 
ers in this regard. Table XVIII gives the different ways 
in which pupils say they attack the Latin sentence when 
attempting to prepare an assignment. It also shows the 
methods which their teachers say they train the pupils to 
employ. 
According to the data from the pupils’ replies presented 
in Table XVIII, each pupil had an average of nearly two 
ways of attacking the Latin sentence. This may indicate 
that the pupil followed different methods in different years; 
but it is likely that in most instances he has no well-defined 
method of attack, and that there is much confusion in his 
mind as to how he really approaches the problem, although 
only 255, or 7%, say that they followed no particular method 
of study in getting the thought or in translating.” 
As indicated by 2 and 3, Table XVIII, the greater number 
of pupils are following the genius of the English language 
by translating subject—verb—object, or verb—subject— 
object, and then fitting in the rest of the sentence. This 
is, perhaps, the most natural way for a pupil with little or 
no training in method. It is the only satisfying method 
that he is likely to hit upon through trial and error. 
Quite a number seem to be trying to translate every word 
in the order in which it comes in Latin, 651 having checked 
  
°See Report of the Classical Investigation (1924), Appendix B, for description of 
various methods. 
See Byrne, p. 11: “What they have in common, however, greatly exceeds their di- 
vergence. In my opinion, translation should only follow reading. The meaning of a sen- 
tence and its details should have been grasped before making an attempt to set forth 
the ideas in English. It is an unsound procedure to begin by translating portions of 
the sentence and to arrive at the author’s thought only by piecing together the frag- 
ments of English. It is unsound because such a process does not involve reading the 
Latin at all; it merely involves reading some crude English phrases. Instead of pro- 
ceeding to an English version by this method, it would be preferable to go at once to 
the Loeb or similar translation and secure a superior rendering. If we assume that 
the reading process is to precede translation, the latter appears merely as a supple- mentary step. For our purposes it is unnecessary to try to extend analysis beyond 
the completion of the reading act.” 
For an extended treatment of the matter of comprehension and translation of 
Latin, see Report of the Classical Investigation (1924), pp. 188ff. 
‘Report of the Classical Investigation (1924), p. 96: “The entire available evidence 
from various sources seems to be fairly conclusive that pupils studying Latin in sec- 
ondaty schools have not succeeded in developing proper methods of reading Latin as 
atin.”

this as one method of procedure. A much larger number— 
1,005 (27.9%)—say they followed the laborious method of 
getting the meanings of all the words and then piecing them 
together so as to make sense. 
Approximately one-fourth of the pupils follow the method 
of grouping on the basis of thought before translating, but 
the number reading the Latin sentence for the thought be- 
fore trying to translate or study it in detail is relatively 
small, as shown by the percentages in 6, 7, 8. Since the 
methods indicated in 6, 7, 8, Table XVIII, are similar, a 
group tabulation was made to determine how many pupils 
had checked one or more of the three. The number was 
found to be 1,355, or 37.6%, of the total number of pupils 
considered. Regardless of the fact that some of these same 
1,355 pupils may have checked other methods, the evidence 
is sufficient to show that a fairly large percentage of pupils 
are familiar with this type of procedure. 
It is notable, but not surprising, that there is little close 
agreement in the figures representing pupils’ and teachers’ 
replies relative to the methods under consideration. In 
nearly every instance the teachers say they are emphasiz- 
ing just the methods which few pupils say they are using in 
their study. For example, 49.7% of the pupils say they 
attack a Latin sentence according to 3, Table XVIII, but 
only 26.7% of the teachers indicate this as one of the meth- 
ods which they teach their pupils. Taking the other type 
of attack represented by 6, 7, 8, an even wider disagree- 
ment is seen. Only 16.9% of the pupils employ the method 
outlined in 6, yet 62.3% of the teachers claim that this is 
the very one on which they put most emphasis. If the tab- 
ulations for the group made up of 6, 7, 8 (which represent 
methods similar in character) be compared, the contrast is 
still conspicuous, 37.6% representing the pupils and 76% 
the teachers. 
The following facts seem to be clear from the data: 
1. A large number of pupils have no particular method 
of attacking a Latin sentence. (See 1 and 9, Table XVIII.) 
2. A goodly number are following in general the Latin 
order and trying to get the meaning of Latin as the Romans 
did (6, 7, 8). 
3. The largest group say they follow the order and 
thought processes of the English sentence in undertaking the 
solution of the difficulties of reading and translation (3). 
4. The teachers of these pupils say they are emphasizing 
a general type of method entirely different from that which 
pupils most frequently follow. A comparison of 2, 3 with 
5, 6, 7, 8, Table XVIII, shows that in reading Latin the
-P-A-G-E-43

Methods of Study 43, 
pupils are following an analytical or piecemeal method, if 
any at all, while the teachers say they are training them to 
use the comprehensive or natural method—that is, to fol- 
low the thought of the Latin sentence in the Latin word 
order. 
5. There is evidently much confusion on the part of both 
pupils and teachers as to the methods used. If the teach- 
ers are really teaching the methods they say they are teach- 
ing, they are failing to get their methods established in the 
habits of the pupil or in his methods of study. The teach- 
ers doubtless believe in the methods which they advocate 
and have much of the leading expert opinion on their side,’ 
®The older type of method is represented by Bennett & Bristol, Teaching of Latin and Greek (1906). In summary form, his principles are: (a) The process of translation provides one of the greatest values of the study of 
foreign languages (pp. 18, 1 (b) The subjective acau (p. 88). (c) The subjective acquisition of Latin is impossible in school (pp. 95, 96). 
Hale, The Art of Reading Latin (1886), p. 12, in discussing methods similar to those represented by 2 and 3 in Table XVIII, says: “Now, all this is wrong. It is a 
frightful source of confusion to prowl about here and there in the sentence in a self- 
blinded way that would seem pathetic to a Roman, looking at things without the side- 
lights afforded to him by the order; and, further, it is a frightful waste of time.” Again, in commenting on a method not unlike those mentioned in 6, 7, and 8, he remarks (p. 15): “This is the one method that should everywhere be rigorously used, from the day of the first lesson to the last piece of Latin that the college graduate 
reads to solace his old age.” 
Greenough, preface to his edition of Hutropius (Boston, 1892), concludes his re- marks on this question thus: “The essence of all this is that, to learn to read a lan- guage, the words must be taken as they come, with the ideas they are supposed to convey (and must be found to make a mental picture in that order), no matter 
whether the order is familiar or not.” Ancient Language Syllabus, State Department of Education of New York (1919), 
p. 2, has this to say: ‘Exercises in translation at sight should begin in school with the 
first lessons in which Latin sentences of any length occur, and should continue throughout the course with sufficient frequency to insure correct methods of work on the part of the student. From the outset particular attention should be given to de- 
veloping the ability to take in the meaning of each word—and so, gradually, of the 
whole sentence—just as it stands. The sentence should be read and understood in the order of the original, with full appreciation of the force of each word as it comes, so far as this can be known or inferred from that which has preceded from the form and the position of the word itself. The habit of reading in this way should be en- 
couraged and cultivated as the best preparation for all the translating that the stu- dent has to do. No translation, however, should be a mechanical metaphrase. Nor should it be a mere loose paraphrase. The full meaning of the passage to be trans- 
lated, gathered in the way described above, should finally be expressed in clear and natural English.” Pennsylvania Syllabus in Latin, quoted in Latin Notes (1924), p. 16: “From the beginning the pupil should be led to see that he is learning to understand a Latin sentence just as the Romans did, gaining a tentative meaning of its various elements, 
but reserving final judgment as to forms, meanings, and constructions until the end 
of the passage has been reached. It was, of course, impossible for a Roman, while 
listening to a speech, to search first for the subject, then for the verb, and so on. Nor is the pupil, though just beginning the study of Latin, to be allowed to proceed in such a mechanical way.” H. A. Brown, A Study of Ability in Latin in Secondary Schools (1919), p. 141: “There should be a great deal of practice in glancing rapidly over a sentence or a 
number of sentences or even a paragraph, sensing the meaning in the original, fol- 
lowed by a statement of the thought in English. Pupils would thus establish habits of grasping accurately the thought as they do in English, without being focally conscious of all the minute particulars of form and syntax. Facility in doing this well would enable Latin classes to read pages where they now read sentences and whole books where at present they read chapters. This is one of the important causes of the meager results in teaching Latin.” Lee Byrne, The Syntac of High-School Latin (1909 and 1918), p. 9: “Experiments with English reading, as is well known, have shown that the rapid reader does not    ion of a foreign language has slight educative value

44 Content and Method in High-School Latin 
but it is worth little for teachers to subscribe to worth- 
while educational principles which do not become a vital 
part of their teaching and subsequently of the method of 
study of their pupils. 
Of pupils indicating 6, 7, and 8 in Table XVIII, 1,051 
answered the question, “Did you read the Latin aloud?” 
Of those answering the question, 252 (24%) said “Yes” 
and 799 (76%) said “No.” Of the teachers, 50.7% say 
they did, and 49.3% say they did not, teach pupils to read the 
Latin aloud. The disagreement in the replies from pupils 
and teachers is still noticeable. 
General Use of Notes.—The notes in the text are regarded 
as legitimate and necessary helps in the mastery of a Latin 
assignment. The extent to which these are used by pupils 
  
  
dwell on the separate words, so far as his vision is concerned. It is well to remember 
that, no matter how fast he is, he still reads his text in the order in which the author 
wrote it. He does not jump from the beginning of the sentence to the end and then 
back to the middle, as in a former day in Latin classrooms. But the skilled reader 
of English moves his eyes in a series of forward jumps, and in each pause between 
jumps his eyes dwell on a range of several words at one time. The number of words 
seen simultaneously is, however, not very large; even in the case of an unusually rapid 
reader of English it does not appear to be more than five or six words.” 
©. H. Judd and S. T. Buswell, Silent Reading: A Study of Various Types, Supple- 
mentary Educational Monographs, No. 23, University of Chicago Press (1922), p. 126, 
conclude from their investigation, based upon the photographic study of eye move- 
ments of fourteen pupils, that “analytical types of reading are universal and of such order as to make it evident throughout that these students have not learned to read 
Latin.” 
Again, p. 137: “Latin students are not taught to read. They are trained only to 
look at words; not only so, but they are so trained to look at words that it is quite 
impossible to find any system in their looking. There seem to be no mental devices in 
their experience for disentangling a complex of Latin words.” 
This is an exaggerated notion of the situation and based on too few cases to be 
representative and reliable. Yet the methods which most pupils follow are likely to 
produce some such situation as that described above. 
A. W. Burr, Classical Jouynal (1924), XIX, p. 499: “The study of Latin is not so 
necessary, so interesting in this day and generation, that the teaching of it makes little 
difference. Latin goes to-day by the way it is taught, and needs the best ways of the 
twentieth century. The ways and ends of centuries ago are helpless. The place of 
Latin in daily life is different, and the boys even are very different. Nevertheless, 
any visitor will find far too much that is traditional in Latin classrooms. Teachers 
know their subjects, but not the psychology for putting it across nor the purpose of 
its study. To-day Latin needs the help of the study of mental processes, of the reac- 
tions of Henry and Jane.” 
Ancient Language Syllabus, Bulletin New York State Department of Education 
(1919), p. 3: “In reading, the pupil should be required to observe the composition of 
the words, their endings, and their probable relation as dependent both upon ending and position. Careful attention should be called to the structure of each sentence and 
to the relation of the clauses. The meanings of words which the pupil is not sup- 
posed to know should be given to him, or he may have at hand a vocabulary or dic- 
tionary for these. An exercise of this kind should be one of directing on the part of 
the teacher. Such hints and information should be given as are needed to prevent a 
waste of effort by the pupil. Independent work is always to be encouraged, and the 
help given should be withdrawn gradually as the pupil’s power grows.”

and the manner of using them may be seen from the data 
given below. The figures showing the teachers’ point of

It is evident that many of the pupils gave more than one 
method of using the notes. This makes the analysis of the 
data more difficult than if each pupil had indicated a single 
method. The fact that pupils gave more than one answer 
may be due to carelessness, but it is more probably the re- 
sult of having used different methods at different times or 
in different years. The data, however, are perfectly clear as 
to actual methods pupils generally use, since 3,230 (91.4%) 
say they followed the notes line by line as they prepared 
their lessons; a very few first read all the notes; 25.2% 
looked ahead for any translations given; and only 22.3% 
read the notes after having done their best to prepare the 
assignment independently. 
The teachers of these pupils say that, in training their 
pupils to use the textual notes in connection with the study 
of Latin, they are placing the emphasis on the methods of 
which pupils are making the least use. Compare especially 
methods 3 and 4, where it is seen that there is total lack of 
agreement between the theory of teachers and supposed 
practice of their pupils. 
A small number of pupils gave voluntary answers not 
indicated in the question blank, the more interesting being:
-P-A-G-E-46

“T looked at the notes only when I could not translate a 
hard sentence;” “Notes no help;” “I never used notes.” 
Use of Grammar References.—The proper use of gram- 
mar references given in the notes of the text is also desir- 
able. The next table tells what 3,530 pupils and 329 of 
their teachers say they do in this regard. (See Appendix 
for questionnaire to teachers, 1924.)

For some reason even here we find a few pupils and teach- 
ers checking more than one method of procedure; but the 
pupils’ usual way of using the references is made evident 
when we note that only 17.2% looked up all references, 
23.1% used them when especially assigned, a few never 
looked them up, while 54.7% employed them only as an aid 
in understanding difficult passages. This latter method 
is in general perhaps the most desirable way to use gram- 
mar references, since many references are given for which 
there is little need and many omitted that should be in- 
cluded. That the emphasis is placed on this latter pro- 
cedure by the teachers also is shown by the high percent- 
age of their replies on this method. It is also clear that a 
fairly large percentage of the teachers hold the pupils re- 
sponsible for all notes in the text. (See 1, Table XX.) The 
small percentage of teachers who use method 3 indicates 
that definiteness of purpose in the assignment of grammar 
references is not at all conspicuous. 
Vocabulary.—There is no more necessary phase of Latin 
study than the real mastery of a reasonably large number 
of important words. Without a well-developed vocabulary, 
progress is very slow and unsatisfactory. The different 
means by which 3,530 pupils say they master new words

and the way in which 329 of their teachers say they have

Out of the 3,530 pupils checking Group Five, it is notable 
to find that 1,989, or 56.3%, say that they look up every 
new word as soon as they meet it. Only one-third of all 
the pupils, or about two-thirds of those using method 1, try 
to decide what the vocabulary form will be before starting 
to look up an unfamiliar word (see 2). Only 37.8% of all

pupils replying indicate that they try to work out the mean-

Latin and English words. Of these pupils, 97.3% say that 
they are familiar with technical questions as among the ones 
most frequently asked in the Latin recitation (Table XXV, 
10). Yet only 36% to 70% of these same pupils say they 
are familiar with classroom questions involving the deter- 
mination of the meaning of a new word by methods such as 
are indicated in Table XXI, 3. (See Table XXV, 18, 14, 
15, for classroom practice in this regard.) : 
In Table I it was pointed out that 46.7% of all pupils 
replying gave “It helped in English” as one reason for con- 
tinuing their Latin. It is interesting to note that the num- 
ber using the context and related English and Latin words 
in the mastery of the Latin vocabulary compares favorably 
with the number giving that reason. 
Only 14.9% of the teachers admit that they advise pupils 
to follow the method indicated in 1, Table XXI. There is 
fairly close agreement in the practice of teachers and pupils 
relative to the procedure stated in 2 of the table above.

*Mason D. Gray, Introductory Lessons to English and Latin (1917), pp. 20 and 
30, outlines an excellent scheme for getting the meaning of Latin words by context, 
English derivatives, and related Latin words. His statement with regard to vocabu- 
lary, Supplementary Lessons in English and Latin (1917), p. 144, is also interesting 
in this connection: “The Latin vocabulary that should ultimately remain in the per- 
manent possession of the pupil should consist of those words most intimately associ- 
ated with English. Efforts should be continuously made during the four years in all 
the relations of Latin vocabulary to English to give the pupil an adequate training 
in the use of that equipment. These applications fall into certain general categories 
which should pervade the daily work and which are summed up on the following 
pages for reference, review, and drill. The development of these details should be a 
gradual and continuous process, coterminous with the study of Latin.” 
The discussion of the vocabulary problem in the Report of the Committee on the 
Junior High-School Syllabus for Latin, Bulletin New York State Department of Edu- 
cation (1919), p. 30, is so comprehensive and valuable that it is here quoted in full: 
“At present the usual process by which a vocabulary is acquired is memorization— 
a process that has very slight, if any, training value. Yet the task of memorizing 
vocabulary makes one of the largest demands upon the pupil’s time and energy of all 
problems confronting him. There is a growing tendency throughout the country to substitute logical processes for mnemonic. The committee believes this to be the only sound basis for the mastery of vocabulary. 
“There are three logical tools which can be used in the solution of Latin words— 
context, English derivatives, and related Latin words. Pupils should be taught that it is in their power to solve for themselves the meaning of each new Latin word as they 
meet it. But only as the result of a careful initial training and systematic, daily 
application thereafter can pupils be expected to use these tools effectively. The idea 
of context is already familiar to pupils, for it is by that process, operating uncon- 
sciously, vaguely, and uneconomically, that a large part of their English vocabulary has been acquired. It devolves upon the Latin teacher to teach pupils to use this 
logical tool consciously and to bring to bear upon a new word with increasing pre- 
cision the general meaning of the rest of the sentence. It may be remarked, in pass- 
ing, that if pupils are taught early in their course to use context in this way, much 
meaningless and often contradictory translation will be eliminated in their later work ; 
for if context becomes a vital element in the solution of a doubtful word, the meaning 
finally assigned to it will, at any rate, be consistent with that context. 
“In using English derivatives to solve a Latin word, pupils should recognize clearly 
that a derivative furnishes a clue only to the meaning of the Latin word and is not 
itself the meaning. The evidence, in other words, must be selected and carefully 
weighed. There is usually one derivative that best preserves the meaning. This word 
should at first be given; but as the pupils gain facility, they should be left more and 
more to their own resources. 
“It will be noted that on this basis English derivatives are studied not simply as a 
valuable by-product, one of the major applications of Latin, but as a means of ac- 
quiring the Latin vocabulary itself. These two mutually supporting functions of de- 
rivative study should be kept constantiy before the puoil. 
“Tt will be noted, further, that from the first a distinction must be drawn between 
derivatives already familiar which assist in interpreting a new Latin word and deriva- 
tives that are unfamiliar which are interpreted by the Latin. Such a distinction can- 
not be made absolutely, but experience will afford a basis of classification sufficiently 
accurate for practical purposes. 
“The third logical process, the use of related Latin words, will inevitably exert a 
certain influence upon the choice of the vocabulary itself; for appropriate material 
must be provided if pupils are to form the habit of associating and using related 
Latin words. Thus the prefixes and suffixes should be introduced earlier than is usual, 
both to assist in this field and to assist in the interpretation of English.” 
‘Again, p. 32: “The training value involved in the process of applying Latin vocab- 
ulary to environment is dependent, in the first place, upon the formation of a gen- 
eralized habit of application, resulting from daily exercises in recognizing identical 
elements inside and outside the Latin class—in other words, training in ‘identifying 
experiences.’ It is vital that this habit of application should be a conscious and ever- 
present aim in the teacher’s mind, in the first place, because the cultivation of that 
capacity is the ultimate aim of all problems in application; otherwise the process of 
application becomes a transient and comparatively unproductive activity. In the sec- 
ond place, the habit of application is a vital element in the result arrived at, because 
it gives unity and coherence to the various types of applications discussed above in 
connection with the practical values of vocabulary, and removes the danger otherwise 
present of their creating a centrifugal and hence a demoralizing tendency.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
    Methods of Study 49 
ers have had in charge claim to employ this method. If 
this method is the best, the teachers ought to see to it that 
their pupils use it and fix it in their daily habits of Latin 
study.1° 
Summary of Pupils’ Methods of Study.—The data rela- 
tive to the methods used by pupils in preparation of their 
lessons seem to warrant the following conclusions: 
1. The majority of the pupils are not employing the “pre- 
liminary steps” listed in Table XVII. Many are evidently 
beginning their lessons with no thought of their relation to 
what has preceded or what is to follow. This is true in 
spite of the fact that most teachers say they are training 
their pupils to keep in mind the very relations the pupils 
constantly disregard. 
2. In attacking the Latin sentence a considerable num- 
ber of pupils follow no particular method, and a larger 
group look up the words and piece them together by a sort 
of “catch-as-catch-can” method, with the hope of some- 
how making sense. More than half follow the order sug- 
gested by the English sentence, while relatively few are con- 
sistently following the order of the Latin sentence. (See 
5, 6, 7, 8, Table XVIII.) The teachers say they are placing 
the emphasis on just the methods of attack which the pupils 
are rarely using. The methods advocated by the teachers, 
and supposedly practiced by their pupils, have the support 
of expert opinion. But these doctrines are evidently hav- 
ing little influence on the pupils’ methods of study in under- 
standing and then translating a Latin sentence. The pu- 
pils, on the whole, are attacking the Latin sentence in just 
the way they should not, if the teachers and others are right 
in the methods they advocate. There is evidently a lack of 
definite, conscious, and consistent procedure in this regard 
on the part of both pupils and teachers. Both may be con- 
fused as to processes of comprehending, in contrast to those 
of translating, Latin. 
3. The practice of reading the Latin aloud is not com- 
mon. Only about one-half of the teachers say they advo- 
cate this practice, and less than one-fourth of the pupils 
say they read the Latin aloud. 
4. In the general use of notes, 91.4% of the pupils are 
following them line by line as they prepare their lessons. 
This percentage is a little higher than the real situation 
Report of the Classical Investigation (1924), p. 207: “If pupils are actually to 
develop a strong habit of attacking new words in this way in the independent prep- 
aration of their lessons, it is clear that a more persistent effort must be made to give 
ener necessary training through daily practice in comprehension or translation at 
sig]

warrants if the data relative to the other methods be 
considered, for in some instances these pupils checked 
other methods also. The teachers’ advice in this connec- 
tion seems to be disregarded, for their replies indicate that 
the emphasis is being placed on methods of an entirely dif- 
ferent nature. (See Table XIX.) 
5. In the matter of using grammar references, the re- 
plies of pupils and teachers are more nearly in agreement 
than in.the other groups. The use of such references only 
as an aid to the understanding of the difficult passages pre- 
dominates. It is also evident that more than one-third of 
the teachers hold pupils responsible for all grammar refer- 
ences, while only 13.3% make an effort to point out the sig- 
nificant references by special assignment. (See Table XX.) 
6. The methods of study most unsatisfactory of all seem 
to be pursued in the learning of vocabulary. More than 
half of the pupils on meeting a new word look it up at once, 
and only about two-thirds seem to try to decide beforehand 
what the form will be. Some use is being made of the con- 
text and related Latin and English words as means of 
acquiring new Latin words, but the percentage is discour- 
agingly small. These practices exist in spite of the fact 
that only 14.9% of the teachers of these pupils advise them 
to look up an unfamiliar word in the vocabulary, while 86% 
say they train the pupils to get the meaning through context 
and by related Latin and English words. 
7. There is a wide divergence between what the teachers 
presumably think they are training their pupils to do as 
regards methods of study and the practices of these pupils 
as shown by the methods which they say they usually fol- 
low. One explanation of this discrepancy will be found in 
the analysis of the data pertaining to classroom activities 
presented in the next chapter of this study.

CHAPTER VI. 
AS JUDGED BY PUPILS, WHAT ARE THE METHODS 
ON WHICH TEACHERS PLACE MOST EMPHASIS 
IN THE RECITATION? HOW DO THESE 
COMPARE WITH THOSE WHICH THE 
TEACHERS SAY THEY EMPLOY? ~ 
Given objectives that are valid and a content that pos- 
sesses the maximum amount of value and interest, much 
may be accomplished by the teacher. But if a subject is to 
yield results commensurate with the time and effort re- 
quired for its mastery, there must be some definite methods 
of classroom procedure based on tested fundamentals of 
educational practice and clearly defined in the teacher’s 
thinking. The kind of questions asked by the teacher in the 
recitation is usually regarded as a fair index of the effi- 
ciency of her instruction. Pupils soon learn what to expect 
from a teacher in this regard, and there can be no doubt 
that the pupil’s consciousness of the type of question he has 
learned to look for in the recitation is a very great influence 
in his choice of method in the independent preparation of 
his lesson. 
What Are Pupils most often Asked and What least often 
Asked in the Class Recitation?—The next table shows the 
things on which high-school seniors feel that teachers place 
the chief emphasis in the Latin recitation and the things 
1Stevens, The Question as a Measure of Efficiency in Instruction (1912), p. 71: 
“Efficiency of instruction involves good questioning. Good questioning is synonymous 
with the use of good questions. That we do not find good questions identified with 
instruction to any appreciable extent, even in lessons reflecting a relatively small num- 
ber of questions, may find its explanation in any one or all of the following condi- 
tions: (a) the absence of clearly defined purposes for instruction; (b) failure to ap- 
preciate the function of the question as a medium of instruction; (c) dominance of 
the textbook; (d) the feeling of indifference to the methods of the recitation in col- 
leges and training schools for teachers; (e) the almost total neglect of supervision of 
instruction in secondary schools.” 
Again, p. 85: 
“T believe that the remedy for many of the present evils of instruction lies in the 
improvement of our methods of questioning. 
“The aims of any school for the education of the streams of pupils passing through 
its doors year after year must be measured by the kind of work carried on in its indi- 
vidual classrooms. 
“There are established ideals for the conduct of the recitation. Even if these ideals 
are not wholly in accord with the most advanced theories guiding the practice of ele- 
mentary schools, they are, nevertheless, worthy ideals. Furthermore, they are possible 
of realization. 
“A fairly characteristic study of secondary classroom practice shows us that the 
highest aims of education and the highest ideals of instruction are not in evidence to 
any appreciable extent. They are reserved apparently for catalogue embellishment 
and for convention oratory. Who is responsible for the chasm between aims and 
practices in these schools? I believe the responsibility must, first of all, be shouldered by the supervising officer, whether he is the superintendent in a small system or the 
principal in a large system or the specially appointed supervisor. There must be unity 
of purpose, first of all; then there must be supervision of instruction.”

The fact that so many pupils failed to check some of the 
items given in Table XXII makes difficult the interpretation 
of the answers, especially where “most common” and 
“least common” are about equally represented. But the 
frequent omission of some of these by the pupils seems to 
indicate that there was a lack of emphasis on the particular 
question by the teacher. It might be assumed, therefore, 
that the majority of these questions not checked belongs in 
the class of “least common,” but this cannot be proved and so 
has not been included in Table XXII. 
The following facts obtained from these data are sig- 
nificant: It is seen that less than one-half of the pupils re- 
port that they were commonly asked to connect the new 
lesson with what had gone before, by having the story told 
or by relating each assignment to the whole? (1 and 2). 
Only 23.5% say they would expect to be asked to tell the 
story of the advance lesson. The majority. of the pupils 
report that they were commonly asked to “translate the 
review lesson,” “translate the sentence,” or less frequently 
to translate the entire passage (3, 6, 7). Combining 6 and 
7 asa group, 88.4% of all pupils were found to have checked 
either one or both of these questions. Questions on the 
thought of the passage such as “Who sent envoys to 
Cesar?’ “For what purpose?” etc., are indicated as com- 
mon by 68% of the pupils. It is evident from these state- 
ments that a large number of teachers depend upon trans- 
lation as the chief method of determining the pupil’s under- 
standing of a reading assignment. 
More than half of the pupils say that they would expect

to be asked to read the Latin aloud. This must have been 
a purely mechanical procedure, for in Table XVIII, page 
40, it was seen that only 24% of the pupils said that in their 
preparation of a reading assignment they read the Latin 
aloud. It is evident that the relation of this practice to 
the interpretation of the thought of a Latin sentence or 
passage must be made clear to pupils, if they are to become 
interested in the procedure and use it in their methods of 
study. 
Very few report the use of Latin to answer questions in 
class. From this it would be inferred that the direct 
method even in very modified form is not being practiced 
extensively.? (See Table IV, page 18.) 
Questions relating to case and clause syntax are the most 
conspicuous of all, 97.3% of the pupils saying that they 
would expect such questions as are indicated in 10, Table 
XXII. Practically all of these questions were asked in 
connection with the translation. (See Table XXVII, page 
63.) Much emphasis is also placed on forms.* 
The figures in 11 and 13, Table XXII, show that func- 
tional questions are much less familiar to pupils than for- 
mal ones such as those in 10 and 12. Comparatively few 
are asked to use their English derivatives as a help in de- 
termining and remembering Latin words or forms. The 
8Ancient Language Syllabus, University of New York (1919), p. 3: “In the syllabus 
of the first two years, emphasis is repeatedly placed on oral sentence work—Latin into 
English and English into Latin, with books closed. Such exercises will train the ear 
to correct sound and the tongue to correct pronunciation. They will also accustom the 
pupil to thought getting through the ear, and will develop a feeling for proper word 
order in Latin. Moreover, oral exercises of this kind, practiced daily and systemat- 
ically, afford the best possible means of establishing a correct understanding of case 
forms, of case relations, and of the simple concords of the language. The habit of 
imitation and of the exercise of memory, cultivated in the early stages of the study 
of Latin, renders the memorizing of Latin later on in the course an easy task. Ex- 
periment has established the fact that the more capable pupils in a class that has been 
accustomed to systematic oral work in the first year will in their second year of study 
memorize Latin almost as readily as they will memorize English. One of the most 
successful school men of the state has frequently remarked on his indebtedness to the 
teacher who, during his preparatory course, required him to memorize one of the 
Catilinarian orations entire. While it does not appear practicable to prescribe definite 
selections for memorization in connection with the second and third-year work, it is 
earnestly recommended that this effective instrument of instruction should be utilized 
to the fullest extent possible. If proper oral work is done throughout the first year, 
practice in memorizing Latin will prove a time saver in understanding and in appre- ciating the Latin taken up in the more advanced years of study.” 
4H. A. Brown, Latin in Secondary Schools (1919), pp. 140-41: “The use of the class 
period in the upper years is uneconomical and ineffective. A few schools translate all of their Latin at sight, using the class period practically exclusively for this purpose, 
and several others require a good deal of sight work. By far too many teachers, how- 
ever, waste this time in listening to slow, labored, word-by-word, literal translations, 
which the pupils have with difficulty worked out themselves outside of class, to recita- 
tion of rules of syntax in connection with the constructions of the day’s lesson, and to 
descriptions and classifications of Latin forms. All too rarely does one find the teach- 
er’s conception of the classroom to be that of a workshop, in which teacher and pupils 
are working together, teaching and learning how to study effectively. A large part of 
the failure in Latin is doubtless due to this lack of a proper conception of his work 
on the part of the teacher, and also by those administratively in charge of the schools.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
  Classroom Methods 55 
same is true with reference to getting the meaning of new 
words (14). The number (40%) giving this as one of the 
things asked for in class corresponds closely to the percent- 
age of pupils who say they try to associate new words with 
related English and Latin words in their independent study 
of Latin vocabulary. (See Table XXI, 3, page 47.) 
The answers to 15 indicate that a great deal of work of 
some kind is being done in derivative study, but this must 
be of a very general and incidental nature. The data seem 
to indicate that the work is not functioning in the case of 
more than half the pupils while learning their vocabulary. 
As further evidence of failure in relating English and 
Latin word study, it should be noted that only 46.7% of all 
pupils gave “It helped me in English” as one reason for con- 
tinuing their Latin through four years (see Table I, page 
14), while 70.4% say they would expect specific derivative 
work in the class recitation (15). 
Discussions relative to geography, history, mythology, 
etc., evidently have a prominent place in the recitation. 
Scansion also claims much attention. 
Which of the Methods under Consideration Make the 
strongest Appeal to the Interests of the Pupils?—From the 
days of Herbart much has been said and written on the 
subject of “interest” and its relation to the learning process. 
Many conflicting interpretations have been put upon this 
doctrine of interest ; but in spite of vague theories it is still 
a fact that where interest is strongest, satisfactory prog- 
ress is most likely to occur. The methods of teaching Latin 
should enlist the interest of the pupils to the fullest extent 
consistent with sound educational ends. 
The pupils’ relative interest in the various methods em- 
ployed by the teachers in the Latin class is shown in the

It is significant that eleven items (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 18, 
15, 16, 17) in this table were checked by more than 50% 
of the pupils as being questions they liked most. Eight of 
these are quite popular, as indicated by the percentages. 
They are: (2) “Tell what connection this passage has with 
what has gone before,” given by 62.8% of the pupils; (8) 
“Questions on the thought of the passage,” 63.7%; (6) 
“Translate first sentence, etc.,” 65.5% ; (17) ‘‘Scansion, etc.,” 
65.6%; (1) “Tell the story up to the point where the new 
lesson begins,” 69.2%; (8) “Translate review,” 70.9%; 
(15) “Questions on English derivatives,” 76.1%; (16) 
“Questions on history, geography, etc.,” 77.8%. 
Of the things liked least, (9) “Answer in Latin ques- 
tions such as the following,” heads the list, with 81.7% 
of the pupils. The next most unpopular exercises are: 
(11) “Questions on syntax,” 68.7%; (7) “Translate the 
entire passage,” 60.1%; (14) “Questions on Vocabulary, 
etc.,” 54.9%.

In the case of ten of the questions above (3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 
11, 12, 16, 17) the percentage of pupils checking them as 
“the things liked best” is smaller than the percentage indi- 
cating them as “things most often asked.’”’ The percentage 
of pupils checking questions 1, 2, 4, 9, 18, 15 as the “things 
liked best” is considerably greater than the percentage of 
those checking them as “things most often asked.” This 
means that a smaller number of pupils liked, or thought 
they would like, to do the things listed in Table XXIII than 
stated that these things had been common questions. In 
the case of the other seven questions a larger number of 
pupils liked, or thought they would like, the things called 
for than stated that these things had been common ques- 
tions. It will be seen by reference to Table XXIII that the 
ten questions mentioned are, for the most part, formal, 
while the seven referred to are almost wholly functional in 
nature. 
To What Extent is there Agreement in Replies from 
Pupils and Teachers relative to Classroom Questions ?— 
Thus far in Chapter VI the data secured from pupils rela- 
tive to classroom methods have been considered. It is the 
purpose of this section to consider to what extent there is 
agreement between the methods on which teachers® say 
they place most emphasis and those which pupils* have in- 
dicated as being most familiar to them.   
[here is relatively close agreement between the data from the replies of these teachers respecting what they do and the data from the large number of teachers’ replies telling what methods they recommend, as given in Report of the Classical In- vestigation (1924), Chapter V, pp. 169ff. “The report mentioned in note 5 above says, with reference to the data relative to classroom methods secured by the writer from the high-school pupils (p. 174) : “The 
Swan study, based upon the replies made by 505 students who were continuing the study of Latin in college after having completed four years of Latin in the secondary schools, confirms the evidence secured from the Grise study.”

An examination of Table XXV, relative to “things most 
commonly asked,” reveals the following facts: 
1. Twelve of the questions (2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 
16, 17) have been checked by more than 50% of ‘both teach- 
ers and pupils as being methods with which they are famil- 
iar or which they usually employ in the recitation. In most 
cases, however, the agreement is not close. In 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 
11, 15 the percentages for teachers are from 3% to 18.8% 
higher than those for the pupils; while for questions 6, 10, 
12, 16, 17 the teachers are represented by percentages of 
from 1.9% to 16.6% lower than the pupils. 
2. The greatest variation in pupils’ and teachers’ replies 
on the same items is found in connection with methods with 
which fewer than 50% of the pupils say they are familiar 
(1, 4, 9, 18, 14). The teachers’ percentages for these are 
higher in every instance and represent a range of from 
9.5% to 26.8% higher than that of pupils. 
3. In general, the greatest lack of agreement in the re- 
plies is connected with such questions’ as: 
(1) Tell the story up to the point where the new lesson 
begins. 
(2) Tell what connection this passage has with what has 
gone before. 
(4) Tell briefly the story contained in the povence les- 
son. 
(13) Questions on inflection, such as “How sas the Eng- 
lish word ‘opinion’ help you to tell the declension of 
‘opinio’ ?” 
(14) Questions on vocabulary, such as: “How did you get 
the meaning of ‘reverti’ (a new word) ?” 
(15) Questions on English derivatives, such as “Give five 
derivatives from ‘mitto.’ 
In the case of every one of the methods just named the 
percentage of the teachers who say they commonly use 
them in the recitation is much greater than the percentage 
of their pupils who report that these are methods with which 
they are familiar. It is significant that these questions 
under consideration are of the functional rather than the 
formal type. By referring to Tables XXIII and XXIV, 
pages 56, 57, and the discussion following these, it will be 
seen that these represent just the type of questions in which 
pupils say they are most interested. 
4. The closest agreement in the replies is found in ques- 
'These questions are given the same numbers they have in Table XXV.

tions of a formal rather than functional nature. For ex-

(3) Translate the review lesson. 
(6) Translate the first sentence, second sentence, etc. 
(7) Translate the entire passage. 
(10) Questions on syntax, such as: “Give the reason for 
the case of ‘rebus,’ etc.” 
(12) Questions on inflection, such as: “Decline ‘aestas,’ 
conjugate ‘mitterentur,’ etc.” 
These are five of the ten questions involving things 
which a smaller number of pupils liked, or thought they 
would like, to do than stated that these things had been 
common questions. (Table XXIV, page 57.) 
5. These comparisons show that, on the whole, the em- 
phasis in the Latin recitation is placed upon things of a 
more or less formal nature; that it is characterized by 
questions that call for purely memory answers rather than 
by questions that are functional and calculated to be thought- 
provoking. From the viewpoint of the pupil, this is un- 
mistakably true, and is confirmed by the close agreement 
in the replies of pupils and teachers as pointed out in the 
preceding paragraph. The teachers evidently think they 
are also paying considerable attention to the functional side 
of instruction, as is shown by the summary in paragraph 3 
above. The exercises pupils say they expect in the recita- 
tion show close agreement with the methods which they 
employ in their independent study. (See Chapter V, espe- 
cially pages 40-49.) This indicates that, whatever may be 
the theories and aims of teachers, the methods which they 
recommend and which they say they employ have not en- 
tered fully into their pupils’ consciousness in the prepara- 
tion of lessons.? Pupils seem to be influenced primarily by 
what they have learned through experience to expect in the 
recitation. 
6. The presentation and analysis of the data and the con- 
clusions already drawn show unmistakable evidence of con- 
fusion and lack of mutual understanding between pupils 
and teachers as regards the aims and methods of the recita- 
tion.1° 
When Were Certain Questions Asked?—Not only are the 
number and character of questions important in the recita-   
‘The same notation is used here as in Table XXV, from which these questions 
were taken. 
*Stevens, The Question as a Measure of Efficiency in Instruction (1912), p. 2: 
“After all, it is what he (the teacher) does in the classroom rather than what he 
aims to do that counts in the education of youth.”

tion, but the timeliness of the questions is also significant. 
The next table shows in what connections questions on syn- 
tax and inflection, like 10 and 12 in Tables XXII to XXVI, 
pages 52-60, were asked. The data were obtained from re- 
plies to the questions: “Were questions asked in connection 
with the translations? If so, were they usually asked be- 
fore, during, or after the translation of the passage?”

The total number of pupils and teachers giving “before,” 
“during,” and “after” is greater than the total number 
_ checking “yes” and “no.” This is due to the fact that a few 
pupils and teachers indicated by checking more than once 
that the questions were asked at different times in the reci- 
tation. This does not affect the value of the data. The 
pupils’ replies show that such questions are practically al- 
ways asked in connection with the translation of the passage 
being studied. The teachers’ replies reveal the same thing, 
but to a slightly less degree. It is clear, therefore, that most 
of the questions on syntax had for their chief purpose some- 
thing other than the clearing up of difficulties in advance or 
otherwise helping the pupil to understand the passage being 
studied.!2 
The Advance Assignment.—No more important problem 
confronts the teacher of any subject than that of lesson 
assignment. There are reasons to believe that teachers of 
Latin, as well as teachers of other subjects, are often very 
careless and indefinite in this respect. Table XXVIII tells 
what these pupils say their teachers are doing in connection 
with four important phases of lesson assignment in Latin. 
It will be noted that not all of those replying to the ques- 
tionnaire answered this question. The percentages are 
based on the number indicating each kind of help.   
For some reason only 279 of the 329 teachers replying to the questionnaire an- 
swered this question. All teachers replying answered ‘‘Yes,” and for this reason 100 
is given as the percentage.

It is quite evident that there is a wide variation in the 
practice of teachers with respect to help of any sort on the 
advance assignment. Sight reading is reported by the ma- 
jority of pupils, but only 30.5% say they had it three or 
more times a week.1* The percentage of teachers report- 
ing this help as often is only 18% greater. The little train- 
Report of the Classical Investigation (1924), p. 191: “Ninety-seven per cent of 
the teachers filling out the general questionnaire indicated their belief that sight trans- 
lation should be made a regular part of the work, and a majority of these teachers 
expressed the opinion that from one-fifth to one-fourth of the class time should be 
devoted to this type of work.” 
Syllabus of Ancient Languages, New York State Department of Education Bulletin 
(1919), p. 2: 
“Differences of opinion exist as to the relative emphasis that should be placed 
in teaching on the translation of definitely prescribed selections and on sight 
translation, systematically practiced as a means of developing power in dealing with 
the language. Manifestly the value and success that will attach to either procedure 
will depend in large measure on the degree of skill that is displayed by the teacher in 
the pursuit of his art. The most successful teachers of Latin practice both methods,

ing that most pupils are receiving in methods of attacking 
the advance assignment, through reading at sight in class, 
coupled with the type of questions asked (Tables XXIII to 
XXVI, pages 56-60), helps to explain the methods used by 
pupils in their independent study (see Table XVIII, page 
40). This lack of training is also responsible for the meth- 
ods which most pupils use in their study of vocabulary. 
(See Table XXI and pages following.) If pupils are really 
to develop the habit of solving the meaning of new Latin 
words as they meet them in their study, by context and 
through related Latin and English words, it is clear that a 
more persistent effort must be made by their teachers to 
give them this training through frequent practice in com- 
prehension or sight translation. 
More than half of the pupils say they never received help 
in the form of supervised study. This is nearly twice as 
great as the number of teachers who say they give no help 
of this kind. Only about one-fifth of the pupils say they 
had this sort of help three or more times a week. Twice 
this number of teachers claim to give supervised study this 
often. The variation is, no doubt, an indication of much 
confusion on the part of both pupil and teacher as to just 
what constitutes supervised study. It may be safely con- 
cluded that, in general, little supervised study exists.!+ 
Nearly half of the pupils replying to this question say 
that the teachers never translate any of the advance assign- 
ment. About 23% say that they got such help from two to 
five times a week. It is rather remarkable that the per- 
centage of teachers saying they translate the advance les-

though in varying degrees in the different years of the course. A large measure of 
freedom in choosing one’s method seems indispensable. In presenting a syllabus that 
is to be made the basis for setting examinations, however, the prescription of a con- 
siderable amount of text for intensive reading seems a necessity. The designation of 
four orations of Cicero and four books of Vergil for such reading does not appear 
unreasonable. 
“Even within the range of the prescribed readings the teacher should feel quite 
free to adopt his own method of. procedure, subject only to the limitations that he 
will be responsible to his classes for compassing the year’s work in a successful man- ner. 
“Exercises in translation at sight should begin in school with the first lessons in which Latin sentences of any length occur, and should continue throughout the course 
with sufficient frequency to insure correct methods of work on the part of the student. 
From the outset particular attention should be given to developing the ability to take in the meaning of each word—and so on, gradually, of the whole sentence—just as it stands. The sentence should be read and understood in the order of the original, with full appreciation of the force of each word as it comes, so far as this can be known or 
inferred from that which has preceded and from the form and the position of the word itself. The habit of reading in this way should be encouraged and cultivated as the 
best preparation for all the translating that the student has to do. No translation, 
however, should be a mechanical metaphrase. Nor should it be a mere loose para- phrase. The full meaning of the passage to be translated, gathered in the way de- 
scribed above, should finally be expressed in clear and natural English.”

son is only about half that of pupils who claim their teachers 
do translate. More than a third gave “sometimes” as indi- 
cating their teachers’ practice. 
More than half of the pupils never, or rarely, heard the 
story of the advance assignment told by the teacher. The 
teachers’ replies indicate that only 34.4% never use this as 
a means for help in assignment. Excepting the percent- 
ages representing the indefinite number “sometimes,” there 
is fairly close agreement in the data of (d) Table XXVIII. 
From the data presented in Table XXVIII it is quite clear 
that adequate assistance or training for the pupil in the 
preparation of the advance assignment is not found in most 
of the schools from which these data come. 
Classroom Discussions, etc.— Aside from the regular 
class routine of questions, answers, tests, drills, etc., there 
are other matters, incidental in a way, yet very necessary 
to the vitalized and effective recitation. Table XXIX fol- 
lowing presents what pupils say is being done in regard to 
five of these important matters of the Latin recitation. 
The teachers’ statements are tabulated under the same 
headings.

A glance at the table shows that the replies from pupils 
and teachers are in agreement as to the relative percentages 
for each of the items named. It is significant, however, 
that in all instances relative to “methods commonly em- 
ployed” the teachers’ percentages are higher than those of 
the pupils. The method most frequently employed is ‘dis- 
cussion by teacher,” with “use of maps” ranking second. 
Nearly half of the pupils say that reports and the use of 
pictures are not common, while 86.7% say lantern slides are 
rarely used or not used at all. 
All these methods are popular, some of them highly so. 
Aside from “use of maps” and “discussion by teacher,” 
however, those methods most liked are just the ones least 
used by the teachers. The frequency of the use of maps 
exceeds even its popularity.

The answers are about what one would expect. The rea- 
sons for “yes” are interesting, but the numbers are too 
small to be of much significance. The attitude of the pupil, 
as shown by thé large number preferring the translation of 
Latin into English, and therefore answering “no,” is quite 
clear. The objection is due largely, no doubt, to the greater 
difficulty of translating English into Latin, to the uninter- 
esting material used, and to the formal and rigorous meth- 
ods employed in teaching Latin composition. 
Summary of Classroom Methods.—The matter of class- 
room questions covers a wide field. Twelve of the seven- 
teen questions found in Tables XXII to XXVI were checked 
by more than 50% of both pupils and teachers as being 
methods with which they are familiar or which they usually 
employ in the recitation. In most cases, however, there is 
not close agreement in the percentages based on the replies 
of pupils and teachers. The most noticeable lack of agree- 
ment is seen in connection with those questions which fewer
-P-A-G-E-68
  68 Content and Method in High-School Latin 
than 50% of the pupils report as being familiar to them and 
which are given as “things commonly asked” by a compar- 
atively high percentage of teachers. These questions are 
almost entirely of the functional type (page 61) and are just 
the ones in which pupils say they are most interested. The 
closest agreement in pupils’ and teachers’ replies is found in 
questions of a formal rather than functional nature (page 
62). These are, in general, the questions which are re- 
ported as “things most often asked” by a much larger per- 
centage of pupils than said they were “things most liked.” 
(Tables XXIII, XXIV, pages 56, 57; see also discussion, 
pages 58, 61, 62). 
Questions on syntax and inflection are usually asked by 
teachers in connection with the translation of the passage 
being studied. (See Table XXVII.) 
In the assignment of lessons the pupils’ replies show that 
the matter of sight translation, supervised study, transla- 
tion, and telling of the advance lesson story by the teacher 
are being neglected by more than 50% of the instructors. 
The teachers’ replies indicate a more frequent use of these, 
but the indefinite designations ‘sometimes,’ “when there 
is time,” and the fact that few employed any of these meth- 
ods oftener than once or twice a week reveal a lack of sys- 
tematic practice. 
Discussions by teachers hold a very prominent place in the 
recitation. According to pupils, maps are regularly used 
by 76.2% of their teachers. About half of the pupils reply- 
ing give “reports by pupils” and the “use of pictures” as 
methods with which they are familiar. Lantern slides are 
found in only 13.3% of the schools, according to pupils. 
The items in Table XXIX named as “methods commonly 
employed’”’ show, in the teachers’ replies, percentages of 1.9 
to 17.1 higher than those based on pupils’ replies. The rela- 
tion is, however, notably close between the percentages 
given for the different methods. (Table XXIX.) 
The translation of Latin into English is far more popu- 
lar than the writing of Latin prose, as shown by the per- 
centages 89.4 and 10.6 given by pupils for the two processes, 
respectively. (

CHAPTER VII 
GENERAL SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
Detailed summaries have been given at the end of each 
chapter devoted to one of the questions raised in the “Pur- 
pose of This Investigation” (Chapter I). In this chapter 
it is proposed to give a general survey of the findings as 
revealed by the data collected and to present such conclu- 
sions as the data justify. Here will be found a summary 
of the answers to the first six of the questions mentioned 
above. The answer to question 7, regarding the educational 
implications based upon the findings and conclusions, is 
given in Chapter VIII. The summary and conclusions fol- 
low: 
1. Motives for Continuing Latin.1\—It is evident from the 
data presented in Chapter II that certain influences clearly 
defined in the thinking of pupils are responsible for their 
continuing the study of Latin throughout their high-school 
course. The chief of these motives or influences, named in 
the order of the frequency of their occurrence in the pupils’ 
replies, are: College-entrance requirements, given by 47% 
of the pupils; the value of Latin for English, 46.7% ; belief 
in the value of Latin ‘for mental training, 46.6% ; belief in 
the value of a subject pursued for a long period of time, 
36.3% ; a liking for the subject, 35.9%; belief in the value 
of the subject for foreign modern-language study, 32.6% of 
all pupils replying. An examination of Chapter III, ‘“Gen- 
eral Report of the Classical Investigation,’ shows that the 
reasons given by pupils for continuing Latin agree with a 
number of the objectives stated as valid by teachers of 
Latin, education, and psychology. The comparatively small 
percentage of pupils giving these reasons shows, however, 
that teachers are falling short in their efforts to have pupils 
appreciate fully the value which the study of Latin is 
known or believed to possess. The reason for this discrep- 
ancy becomes apparent when the pupils’ methods of study 
and the classroom procedure of the teachers are carefully 
examined. The difference between theory and practice 
noted here is startling. (Chapters V and VI.) 
2. Reasons for Discontinuing Latin.2—The reasons given 
by pupils in explanation of why some of their classmates, 
who began Latin when they did, dropped the subject are 
more varied and extensive than those given for continuing   
‘See note 1, p. 14,

-P-A-G-E-70
  70 Content and Method in High-School Latin 
the study. All of the reasons are important, but most of 
these are mentioned by a small number of pupils. The chief 
reasons are: Difficulty of Latin, given by 55.4% of the pu- 
pils; a dislike for the subject, 24.3%; excessive time re- 
quired for preparation, 18.9%; and a lack of faith in its 
value, 14.3%. These data help to confirm the conclusions 
stated in the preceding section, the disagreement between 
theory and practice of study and teaching. They also throw 
light on the question answered in section 3 below. 
8. Relative Interest of High-School Pupils in the Reading 
Course in Latin—The data analyzed in Chapter IV show 
that Cesar, Cicero, and Vergil are read by practically all 
high-school pupils who continue Latin through four years, 
and Ovid by more than one-third of them. The relative 
interest which the pupils feel in these authors is illuminat- 
ing. Their replies show conclusively. that Vergil and Ovid 
are extremely popular, while Cesar is quite unpopular in 
comparison with the other writers usually read. Cicero 
occupies a position nearer to Cesar than to Vergil. It is 
clear that on the basis of the pupils’ reactions the reading 
course is conspicuously weak in the second year and strong- 
est in the fourth. The attitude of the pupils in each case 
is due largely to the nature of the content and style of the 
writer. The difficulty of the author seems to have little to 
do with the preferences of pupils. As evidence of this, it 
should be pointed out that: (a) Only 4.2% of the pupils said, 
“Latin was my easiest subject”? (page 14); (b) the time 
required for the preparation of a lesson in Vergil was re- 
ported to be considerably greater than that given to either 
Cesar or Cicero (page 33); (c) in spite of the increase of 
time required for preparation, the use of “translations” 
decreased in the fourth year to a remarkable degree (page 
34). The data from the teachers relative to translations 
corroborate those secured from the pupils.* 
The time required for the preparation of Latin assign- 
ments is, in comparison with the time required for prepara- 
tion in other academic subjects in high school, excessive.* 
There is a need for lessening the amount of Latin required 
or of putting more solid value into other subjects. (See 
section 3, Chapter VIII.) 
4. Pupils’ Methods of Study.°—The data from the pupils’ 
replies reveal much haphazard and purposeless work in the 
preparation of a Latin assignment. The majority of them 
begin a new lesson with no thought of its relation to what

Summary and Conclusions as 
has preceded or is to follow. More than half of the pupils 
are using the analytical method in trying to get the meaning 
of the Latin sentence. More than a third say they either 
follow no method in getting the thought or else look up the 
words and piece them together by guessing. Few are at- 
tempting to get the thought of a Latin sentence as it stands. 
On the whole, it is evident that a large proportion of the 
pupils are not consciously and consistently following any 
deliberately chosen method of attacking the Latin sentence. 
Their other methods of study in connection with use of 
notes, grammar references, and vocabulary are little better. 
In most cases the data are absolutely convincing. Not a 
few, but the majority of pupils are following what, by all 
expert opinion, are regarded as the least effective methods 
of study—a matter of no small concern. 
As shown by the replies from the teachers of these pupils, 
there is a wide divergence between what the teachers think 
they are training their pupils to do and the practices of these 
pupils as shown by the methods which they say they usually 
follow. One explanation of this discrepancy was found in 
the analysis of the data pertaining to classroom activities, 
pase in Chapter VI of this study. 
Classroom Methods——From the data presented and 
smile in Chapter VI the following facts are in evidence: 
(a) Replies from both pupils and teachers show that the 
recitation is characterized by an emphasis upon questions 
that are formal rather than functional (page 62). 
(b) The teachers evidently think they are also paying 
considerable attention to the functional side of instruction, 
but the pupils’ replies do not confirm this. 
(c) The things which pupils say they would expect to be 
called on to do in the recitation show close agreement with 
the methods which they employ in the independent study 
of their lesson. This indicates that, whatever may be the 
aims of the teachers, the methods which they recommend or 
say they employ have not usually entered into the pupil’s con- 
sciousness enough to influence him in his methods of study.* 
The pupil is evidently being influenced primarily by what he 
has learned to expect in the recitation as regards both ques- 
tions asked and methods used.” 
(d) There is a serious lack of systematic, purposeful help 
in the assignment of lessons in Latin. Fifty per cent or 
more of the teachers are doing little if anything in this 
connection. The lack of continuous assistance and training 
through sight translation, supervised study, and similar   
"See footnote 9, page 62. 
7See section 4 above; also Chapter V. 
   
-P-A-G-E-72
72 Content and Method in High-School Latin 
methods, is, without doubt, responsible in part for the meth- 
ods which pupils employ in their independent study and 
for the use of illegitimate helps in the preparation of lesson 
assignments. (See (c) above, also page 35, and Chapter 
¥ 
(e) In general, the “methods most liked” are just the 
ones with which pupils say they are least familiar. 
6. The Relation of Theory, Practice, and Results of Latin 
Teaching—tThe relation of the theories, principles, and 
practices of Latin teachers to the results of their teaching, 
as shown by the agreement or lack of agreement in the data 
from pupils and their teachers, has been pointed out from 
time to time in the discussions, summaries at the close of 
oar and in the conclusions above. These have shown 
that: 
(a) There is some agreement between the motives which 
influence pupils to continue Latin and the objectives given 
by teachers as valid for the subject. But, as pointed out 
in section 1 above, the comparatively small number of pupils 
giving the reasons that agree with certain objectives shows 
that teachers are not succeeding in making pupils fully con- 
scious of the values which they believe the study possesses. 
(b) There is general agreement in regard to the interest 
which pupils feel in the different parts of the reading 
course. The recommendations of teachers as recorded in 
the “Report of the Classical Investigation” is also in har- 
mony with the pupils’ reactions in this regard.$ 
(c) There is little agreement in the methods of study 
which pupils say they follow and those which their teachers 
think they are or should be following. 
The same thing is true, but not to the same extent, with 
reference to classroom methods in general. The methods 
with which pupils say they are most familiar are not usu- 
_ ally the ones which teachers say they most commonly em- 
ploy. 
(d) All the way through, in practically every connection, 
there are unmistakable evidences of confusion and a lack of 
mutual understanding between pupils and teachers as re- 
gards the aims and methods in Latin study and teaching.

CHAPTER VIII 
EDUCATIONAL IMPLICATIONS 
It is the purpose of this part of the study to give a further 
interpretation of the facts summarized in Chapter VII, and 
to point out a few deductions that seem important for Latin 
study and teaching. Attention is again called to the fact 
that this study does not propose to offer a specific outline 
of content and method in high-school Latin. It is not rec- 
ommended that, on the basis of this study alone, any sud- 
den and drastic changes be made in either content or 
method.!. The following implications are based on the find- 
ings in this study, corroborated by other studies and by ex- 
pert opinion: 
1. In Chapter VII, section 1, it was pointed out that the 
relatively small number of pupils checking any one motive 
that caused them to continue Latin revealed a neglect on 
the part of the teachers to impart to their pupils the faith 
in the values claimed for the subject. (See notes, page 15.) 
The data relative to causes which induce pupils to drop Latin 
point to the same conclusion. It is perfectly clear from 
these facts that there is an imperative need for much more 
definite notions on the part of both teachers and pupils rela- 
tive to objectives that are valid for the study of Latin. 
2. The lack of interest felt by pupils in some parts of the 
reading course in Latin as now organized, coupled with the 
opinions of teachers and other educators, suggests that one 
of the problems calling for solution is the selection of a body 
of interesting and worth-while material for the purpose of 
giving variety to the reading course, especially in the sec- 
ond year.2, This does not mean at all that Cesar or any of 
the authors now used should be eliminated; but it is clear 
that pupils should read more books rapidly, especially early 
in the course, and that any method that helps them to read 
widely and with pleasure is legitimate. Motivation and 
interest as means of securing the best efforts of pupils are 
well known. We cannot afford to risk losing our pupils, 
especially in their first taste of Latin literature, by ignoring

  74 Content and Method in High-School Latin 
entirely their interests in the matter of the Latin selections 
they are to read.’ 
8. If other high-school subjects are demanding enough 
time, the time required for preparation of Latin assign- 
ments is excessive and needs to be shortened through re- 
duced requirements or better methods of handling the sub- 
ject; probably both are necessary.‘ Many things that are 
now being done in the Latin class might be omitted or taught 
with less emphasis and the time devoted to more super- 
vised study, rapid reading, functional knowledge of princi- 
ples, etc. For example, the amount of time given to formal 
syntax could be safely reduced. In the recitation, ques- 
tions of this type were found to be the most familiar of all 
to pupils.» (Table XXII, page 52.) 
4, The wide divergence between the methods of study 
which pupils use and those the teachers would have them 
employ suggests that students need constant and careful 
direction. Teachers must provide daily opportunity in the 
recitation for practice in those methods which pupils are 
expected to use in the preparation of their lessons. This 
should be continued until the methods become so much a 
part of the pupil’s consciousness that he will be sure to use 
them in his independent study. 
5. A certain confusion and lack of agreement in methods 
reported by pupils and their teachers have been pointed out 
in Chapters II, V, and VI, and summarized in Chapter VII, 
section 6. It is clearly evident that there must be on the 
part of both pupil and teacher a clarification of the objec- 
tives accepted as valid for the study of Latin, that a more 
thorough and mutual understanding of the aims of the reci- 
*General Report of the Classical Investigation (1924), p. 93: ‘The question of the 
manner in which pupils attack a Latin sentence is primarily one of method. How- 
ever, the question also has a direct bearing on the determination of content.” 
Again, p. 96: “It is our opinion that the common tendency on the part of the pu- 
pils to follow the line of least resistance in their attack upon a Latin sentence is 
largely due to our failure to provide early in the course for sufficient practice with 
easy reading material and to emphasize the functional rather than the formal aspect 
of the elements of the language.” 
“Ww. H. Uhl, How Much Time for Latin? Classical Journal (1924), Vol. XIX, p. 
219: “If the holding power of Latin is to be increased, it is evident that at least one 
of three things must be done: (1) reduce the time requirement by reducing the content 
of the course in amount or in difficulty or in both respects; (2) increase the demonstra- 
ble educational value of the course without at the same time increasing the time re- 
quirement; (3) increase by an appropriate fraction the amount of credit to be earned 
by the study of Latin. The third suggestion presents almost insuperable administra- 
tive difficulties.” 
But another possibility is to make other subjects more nearly equal in the re- 
quired amount of time and effort. 
°The following statements are apparently exaggerated notions of this condition, 
but no doubt contain much of truth: Brown, Latin in Secondary Schools (1919), p. 92: 
“In a good many schools half the time of the recitation period is often spent in dis- 
cussing the minutiz of form and syntax, which according to the evidence contributes 
almost nothing to either ability to translate or read or knowledge of construction.”
-P-A-G-E-75
Educational Implications 15 
tation must be found and the methods to be used must be 
agreed upon.® 
It is not within the scope of this study to offer solutions 
for the difficulties to which attention has been called. The 
riter has accomplished his purpose if he has answered the 
questions proposed in the Introduction and pointed out the 
significant implications which the answers to these ques- 
tions seem to justify. 
A final word should be said relative to Latin teaching in 
general. In the interpretation of the data presented the 
emphasis has been placed on certain defects which the data 
seem to reveal. From this it is not to be inferred that it 
is the opinion of the writer that Latin is more poorly taught 
than other high-school subjects. There are very definite 
reasons for thinking otherwise. The tendencies as revealed 
in the Classical Investigation are, on the whole, encourag- 
ing.7 But the experiences of high-school pupils described 
in this study indicate the need of serious consideration of 
changes in a number of matters regarding content and 
method in high-school Latin. It seems that teachers and 
educators can ill afford to disregard the reaction of the 
“ultimate consumers ;” for if Latin is to live and maintain 
the place it deserves as an instrument of education, it must 
be made interesting and thoroughly worth-while in the eyes 
of high-school boys and girls. It must in the future be made 
to yield even more satisfactory results, with a more eco- 
nomic expenditure of time and effort. 
*Stevens, The “uestion as a Measure of Efficiency in Instruction (1912), p. 29: 
“I am convinced that the faults in practice, since they are so general, must be at- 
tributed to the absence of any stable educational goal and not to inefficiency of indi- 
vidual teachers.” 
‘See General Report of the Classical Investigation, Chapter VI, pp. 249-50. 
B. L. Ullman, in an address on The Modern Trend in Method of Latin Teaching be- 
fore the Classics Section of the 1924 session of the High-School Conference, held at 
the University of Illinois and printed in the report of this conference (1924), says: 
“The fact of the matter is that the teaching of Latin has felt the impulse of changing 
conditions in our schools, in our country, and in the world at large. It is an instru- 
ment as delicate and sensitive as the seismograph, which detects earthquakes taking 
place thousands of miles away. One could almost hazard the assertion that if a his- 
torian hundreds of years in the future had no record of the past century except a 
detailed discussion of the developments of Latin teaching, he would be able to recon- 
struct a history of the century’s civilization, as the paleontologist is reputed to re- 
store the form of an extinct animal from a single bone. If you want to know how 
Latin is going to be taught in the future, you must sense the direction in which our 
civilization is tending and you must foresee what educational developments are in 
store for us.”

GROUP ONE: PRELIMINARY STEPS Bb . I made sure I understood the story up to the point where the new 
lesson began. 
. I tried to guess what would naturally follow in the new lesson. 
. I did not think of the connection with what I had read, but began 
the new lesson at once. wr 
GROUP TWO: METHOD OF ATTACKING THE LATIN SENTENCE oy I followed no particular method of study in getting the thought 
or in translating. 
I looked first for the verb, and translated that; then I fitted in 
the rest of the sentence.

verb, and translated that; then for the object, and translated 
that; then I fitted in the rest of the sentence. 
1 tried to translate each word in the order in which it came in’ 
Latin. 
I decided what word or words made up each thought group as it 
appeared, and then translated the group as an English unit. 
I did the same for the second group, and so on through the 
passage. 
. I read each sentence completely through in Latin, trying to grasp 
the meaning of each word group in the Latin order, and then 
translated the sentence as a whole. 
I read the passage through in Latin for the thought without any 
attempt to translate it. 
I read the passage through in Latin for the general thought before 
attempting to study it in detail. 
. I got the meanings of all the words in a sentence or clause, and 
then pieced them together so as to make sense.

GROUP THREE: GENERAL USE OF NOTES 
I first read all the notes on the passage before taking up the study 
of the Latin text. 
I looked ahead for any translations given in the notes. 
I followed the notes line by line as I prepared my lesson. 
I read the notes only after I had done my best to prepare the les- 
son without their aid. 
GROUP FOUR: GRAMMAR REFERENCES 
I looked up all the grammar references in the notes. 
I looked up the grammar references only for passages which I 
failed to understand without their aid. 
I looked up grammar references only when especially assigned. 
I never looked up grammar references. 
GROUP FIVE: VOCABULARY 
When I met an unfamiliar word, I looked it up at once in the 
vocabulary. 
Before looking up an unfamiliar word I tried to decide what the 
vocabulary form would be. 
I tried to work out the meaning of each unfamiliar word from the 
general meaning of the sentence and from related Latin or 
related English words. 
I made a list of all new words in the lesson and looked them up in 
the vocabulary. 
PART IV. CLASS RECITATION 
. Suppose you had prepared for class recitation the passage from 
Cxsar given in Part III, or a passage from Cicero or Vergil, 
what would you expect to be called on to do in class? Please

  PREFACE 
“Nor psychology, but to psychologize” } represents 
the educational objective toward which this book has 
been written. This fact accounts for certain character- 
istics as to method of presentation, selection and arrange- 
ment of content, direct address, and changes in style, 
all of which contribute toward action. It also accounts 
for the fact that the book is not a dictionary of psycho- 
logical definitions or an encyclopedia of psychological 
facts. 
John Hunter, the famous physician, once said, ‘Don’t 
think; try,” by which he really meant, “Think, but do 
not stop at thinking; test your thought by experiment.” 
The experiments and exercises are designed to occupy 
about the same length of time in the preparation of a 
lesson as the study of the body of the text. No apparatus 
is required, but the instructor will occasionally find it 
advantageous to supply such things as paper and pins. It 
is essential that the exercises be performed with serious 
precision and thoroughness and that the record be made 
before reading the interpretative discussion which usu- 
ally follows the directions. In accordance with avail- 
able time and resources of the institution, demonstra- 
tions, class experiments, and further class exercises

may be translated, “not philosophy, but to philosophize.”

without apparatus should be introduced by the instructor 
in such a way as to sustain the experimental attitude and 
point of view for those parts of the book for which facts 
are merely summarized. By this method, the student 
will not only read about psychological facts, but will do 
things psychological. To maintain this attitude of 
introspection and direct attack on the problem, the 
style of direct address is employed with great freedom. 
The good instructor will continue this in classroom dis- 
cussion, at every point challenging the student to first- 
hand observation, discrimination, and thinking, instead 
of merely conducting the recitation about listed facts. 
The radical shift from light to heavy material — from 
the sustained argument or description at the student’s 
level of achievement to a more or less massive summary 
of facts —is due to the use of the (nductive)method. 
The material is collected at the student’s level of achieve- 
ment and this is followed by a recital of facts to round 
out and furnish a setting for the exercises in the book 
and the instructor’s demonstrations and experiments 
before the class. The frequent use of simple, direct 
statements of fact should foster (precision, clarify 
thought, and point the discussion. 
There is no general agreement among psychologists 
as to what should constitute a first year course in psy- 
chology. The selection of topics has been made on the 
basis of experience in the classroom, from the standpoint 
that the aim of the course is not to make technical 
psychologists, but to make an introduction to psychol- 
ogy function in the life of all students both in and after 
college. This accounts for the frequent references to
-P-A-G-E-7
  PREFACE ix 
the beauty of mental life and the use that a given bit 
of knowledge may have in the direction of human en- 
ergies, particularly toward mental health and education. 
The physiological part is thrown into the background 
and touched on but lightly, because a common mistake 
in the teaching of psychology is to waste the time for 
psychology in teaching anatomy and physiology; the 
essential facts about the nervous system are presented, 
largely through illustrations, in the Appendix. 
The order of topics is not fixed. Some instructors may 
prefer to begin with the chapter on Attention ; others 
may begin with the chapter on Reflexes; and there are 
even some reasons for beginning with the chapter on 
Dreams. For facilitating such freedom in arrangement 
of the courses, chapter topics are made fairly complete 
units. Let it be said once for all that for practically 
every topic that is taken up, it would be logical to say, 
“On this point authors differ; the situation is exceed- 
ingly rich and complicated; our knowledge in this field 
is very scant at the present time; and the author’s 
view may often be wrong.’’ Let the student read this 
statement into the text at every stage and treat the 
author’s presentation essentially as a working hypothesis. 
The author has drawn extracts freely from his Elemen- 
tary Experiments in Psychology (Henry Holt & Company), 
Psychology in Daily Life (D. Appleton Company), and 
Psychology of Musical Talent (Silver, Burdett & Com- 
pany) and, for this privilege, extends his hearty thanks 
‘to the publishers. Thanks are also due to the authors 
quoted in the text and to authors and publishers for 
the privilege of using certain conventional illustrations.

INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
What is psychology? — Psychology is the science of 
mental life. That part of biology which deals with 
human and animal life falls into three fundamental 
sciences:, anatomy or morphology, the science of struc- 
ture ; physiology, the science of function; and psy- 
chology, the science of experience and behavior of the 
organism. There is no sharp line of demarkation sepa- < 
rating these three sciences; because in all animal life 
the anatomical, the physiological, and the psychological 
phenomena are intimately associated and mutually con- 
ditioned. In any adequate account of human and ani- 
mal life from one of these points of view, it is necessary 
to take cognizance of the other two, and there is always 
an overlapping; but the primary task of psychology in 
this division of labor is to describe and explain mental 
life in terms of experience and behavior. 
We recognize both pure and applied psychology. Pure 
psychology is(the systematic description and explanation 
of the phenomena of experience and behavior in them- 
selves; \)whereas applied psychology, or psycho-tech- 
nology, treats of the practical application of psychologi- 
cal principles to life in any and all of its avenues of ex- 
pression. All philosophy, art, pure and applied science,

a>

  2 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
literature, commerce, and the routine of daily life employ 
or deal with mental processes in some capacity; but 
they are not therefore psychology. The procedure is 
psychological only to the extent that we deal with these 
phenomena as such, whether pure or applied. 
Psychology is a natural science since it regards its 
processes as observable phenomena in nature, amenable 
to natural laws; and, as it attempts to describe and ex- 
plain experience and behavior of living beings, it is a 
biological science. The study is scientific to the extent 
that it is systematic and the conditions of observation 
are variable, repeatable, and recordable under control! 
Although no science ever attains this goal in full, psy- 
chology, like other sciences, makes gradual progress 
toward this ideal. 
Psychology has generally been limited to the study of 
mental life in the narrow sense; and behavior has been 
considered only as mental behavior, or in so far as it has 
some relation to mental activity ; but, as there is no sharp 
division between behavior which is conditioned upon 
mentality and that which is not so conditioned, the scope 
of psychology tends to extend so as to include human and 
animal behavior in general. For the sake of brevity, 
we shall use such terms as “ mental life,” ‘‘ mental pro- 
cesses,” “ mental capacities,” and “ behavior ” in this 
textbook in the broad sense so as to include also the be- 
havior of man or animal which is not directly associated 
with mental activities wherever the/ connotation\will 
make this legitimate. A sustained eort to distinguish 
and specify the two aspects would lead to intolerable 
repetition and cumbersomeness.

  INTRODUCTION 3 
Branches of pure psychology. — In the division of 
labor, psychology, like other biological sciences, recog- 
nizes subdivisions both in pure and applied psychology, 
each representing a particular approach to the subject 
according as it is studied, for example, from the point of 
view of man or animal, adult life or development, the 
normal or the abnormal, the individual or the group. 
As now taught, psychology is presented in several fairly 
differentiated courses. Ordinarily there is one general 
introductory course furnishing a general survey from 
varied points of view, such as that represented by this 
text. Beyond this, specialized courses are offered. 
A technical laboratory course in experimental psychol- 
ogy furnishes(training in. the fundamental principles of 
scientific procedure in observation, measurement, statis- . 
tics, interpretation and formulation of the laws of mental 
phenomena.) This course furnishes a fundamental tech- 
nique which should be employed in all branches of psy- 
chology regarded as scientific or experimental. 
Physiological psychology usually reviews the facts 
about the nervous system, as taught in neurology, for 
the purpose of tracing the physical basis of mental life and 
showing the relation between the mental and the neural. 
Genetic psychology is divided into two parts: mental 
, evolution, dealing with the development of mental life 
in the species, and mental development, dealing with 
the unfolding of mental life and the integration of be- 
havior in the life of the individual. This includes psy- 
chology of infancy, of childhood, of adolescence, and of 
senescence. Within this field lies also the problem of the 
inheritance of mental traits.
-P-A-G-E-22
  4 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
» Abnormal psychology deals with mental phenomena 
that are strange and irregular deviations from the normal 
but not strictly regarded as disease ; such as hypnotism, 
mediumship, and alterations of personality. 
» Animal psychology presents a field of great interest in 
itself; but it is of special significance in that it throws 
light upon human life, particularly in the study of the 
simplest and the highest forms of animal behavior. 
Social psychology treats of the social aspects of mental 
life and often blends into other subjects, such as anthro- 
pology, social origins, social ethics, social welfare, and 
eugenics. Sometimes race psychology, or the psychology 
of peoples, is differentiated from social psychology. 
Individual psychology is perhaps the most conspicuous 
field of interest at the present time as it is the foundation 
for “ human engineering ”’ in all its forms of selection 
and guidance of individuals as well as for an intimate and 
accurate account of character or individuality of a per- 
son. It has recently gained great impetus through the 
development of so-called mental tests. 
Statistical psychology is a basic requirement for mental 
measurement, particularly as employed in mental and 
physical testing and in psychology applied to educa- 
tion, commerce, sociology, and vital statistics. 
Behaviorism is a purely objective study of human. 
and animal life without reference to the testimony of 
consciousness. 
These mere names for courses are more or less self- 
explanatory and may suffice to indicate roughly the 
principal points of view that the serious student of 
psychology must acquaint himself with, as each con-

INTRODUCTION 5 
tributes a distinct element to the conception of psy- 
chology as a whole.t 
Exercise. — Write and bring in one question under each of the 
above nine heads to illustrate what kind of questions you think are 
answered in each branch of psychology named. 
Branches of applied psychology. — Psychiatry, as the 
science and art of the treatment of mental diseases, is the 
only fully specialized profession which may be regarded as 
applied psychology, although in many respects it has 
developed independently and has contributed much to 
normal psychology. But aside from psychiatry proper, 
there are many specialties in medicine in which expert 
knowledge of the human mind and behavior is funda- 
mental; as in the care and treatment of children, and 
the mental treatment of all types of defectives and de- 
linquents. Preventive medicine, public health edu- 
cation, and mental hygiene and sanitation are built 
largely upon psychological foundations. 
1 Psychoanalysis has come in from the medical side as a unique and new ap- 
proach to the study of mental disorders, such as hysteria, morbid fear, aversions, 
and suppressed desires; but it also throws much light upon the nature of normal 
mental life. This is yet a polemic field in which we find great enthusiasms and

2 To the Student. — The following nine questions are illustrative. They are all 
taken from the same field; namely, the perception of color. It is, however, not 
necessary to choose them from one field; you should choose for each branch 
questions which are of most interest to you. Your list of questions will be a 
good index to your power of independent observation and thinking and, there- 
fore, to your ability to study psychology. 
Experimental — What are the laws of color contrast? 
Physiological — What are the sense organs of color vision in the retina? 
Genetic — What purposes does color vision serve? 
Abnormal — What are the prevailing types of color-blindness? 
Animal — Do any lower animals see any colors that we do not see? 
Social — Why is red the flag of danger and terror? 
Individual — How can we measure quantitatively an individual's sensitive- 
ness to color? 
‘Statistical — Do children show the same color preferences as primitive people? 
Behavioristic — How fine distinctions in color dan a peacock see?

  6 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
Educational psychology presents numerous phases. 
Thus we have the psychology of the course of study, of 
the child, of the adolescent, of the learning process, of 
discipline, of particular types of training, and of special 
classes. The science and art of education is primarily 
applied psychology. 
The psychology of business and industry appears in sev- 
eral large and distinct fields, such as the psychology of 
advertising, of salesmanship, of personnel, and of voca- 
tional section ol various types of efficiency activities. 
Legal psychology appears in two groups of interest: 
first, the psychology of evidence or testimony and plead- 
ing; and second, the psychology of crime, delinquency, 
defective mentality, penology, dependency, correction, 
and special types of mental deviation. 
Applied social psychology takes such forms as the psy- 
chology of social amelioration, eugenics, race better- 
ment, child welfare, community welfare, recreation and 
amusement, and vocational and avocational guidance. 
The psychology of art appears in the psychology of 
music, of graphic and plastic arts, and of literature, 
dealing in each case with the psychology of art prin- 
ciples, the psychology of the individual, and the psy- 
chology of training for the art. 
The psychology of religion is applied mainly in the inter- 
pretation of religion and religious life, and in the organi- 
zation of character building and religious education. 
These rubrics should not be regarded as an adequate 
classification of the fields of applied psychology. They 
are listed merely as a suggestion for the purpose of 
showing the scope of this practical science.

INTRODUCTION h 
Scope and purpose of elementary psychology. — In this 
book we shall pursue a general elementary introduction 
to the subject of psychology as a whole. It will deal 
primarily with human, adult mental life from the point 
of view of pure psychology; but, throughout, illustra- 
tions will be drawn. freely from each of the various phases 
of psychology enumerated above, both pure and applied. 
The first course in psychology should have certain 
aims, which also represent the results the student should 
seek. The primary aim is to train the student in the 
observation and explanation of mental facts. ~“ Not psy- 
chology, but to psychologize’’ is to be out motto. Other 
aims are secondary; such as, systematic knowledge of 
mental facts; culture, the ability to interpret life; ef- 
ficiency, the ability to use the mind effectively; ap- 
preciation of mental life for itself, which is the basis for 
the recognition of its worth and significance; a founda- 
tion for the mental sciences and arts, such as logic, phi- 
losophy, ethics, esthetics,” sociology, and education ; 
a supplement to the material sciences in that we study 
the knower and the knowing process; and a prelimi- 
nary to the various branches of applied psychology. 
Exercise. — Below is a list of words set by Thorndike as typical 
of the words in our vocabulary. Mark with p the words that denote 
physical facts and with m those that denote mental facts (marking 
with both m and p those that denote both, such as dog).

  8 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
There are as many words in the dictionary with mental 
connotation as with physical. There are as many men- 
tal phenomena subject to scientific study as material 
phenomena. The mental sciences may in the near future 
have as many branches and embrace as large scope as 
the material sciences. 
As out of the pure physical sciences have come en- 
gineering, medicine, architecture, and other forms of 
applied material sciences, so in the near future will come 
the applications of psychology to education, medicine, 
industry, art, and all other varieties of human endeavor 
in which scientific knowledge of human or animal be- 
havior can be made of practical value. 
No science is more intimately and practically related 
to the conduct of human life than is psychology. It is, 
indeed, concerned primarily with those facts and prin- 
ciples of experience and action upon which our under- 
standing of ourselves as conscious beings and our ability 
to understand and sympathize with our fellows depend.1 
In pursuing this study, we are following the advice of 
the old Greek philosophers: ‘“ Know thyself.” 
1“ Only with the aid of psychology can one to the fullest possible extent reap 
the benefits of the study of the other sciences. Language cannot be under- 
stood; literature cannot be appreciated, read, and interpreted; art cannot be 
profoundly comprehended, and even the natural sciences cannot have their full 
import revealed without a knowledge of the mind of man. And, indeed, how 
could this be otherwise, since all science itself is only the product of the human 
mind.” (Ladd) 
“The historian strives today for psychological explanation, the economist 
for psychological laws; jurisprudence looks on the criminal from a psychological 
standpoint; medicine emphasizes the psychological value of its assistance; the 
realist, the artist, the poet fight for psychological truth; the biologist mixes 
psychology in his theories of evolution; the philologist explains the languages 
psychologically; and whilst zsthetical criticism coquets with psychology, 
pedagogy seems ready even to marry her.”’ (Miinsterberg) 
“The essence of business is human nature. Whether we trade in comn:odi- 
ties or ideas, we deal through human contacts. Inthe industrial world the’..n- 
portance of human relationships is constantly increasing.” (Charles M. Schwav)

SENSORY EXPERIENCE 
Exercise: List all the kinds of sensation. through which you can 
become aware of each of the following: (rz) an orange, (2) a hand- 
shake, (3) a distant tree, (4) a beefsteak, and (5) hunger. 
Specialization and codperation in the senses. — All 
knowledge of the world comes to us directly or indirectly 
through the senses. Each sense organ furnishes us its 
own particular kind of information in its own particular 
way — the eye in terms of color and form, the ear in 
terms of noise and tone, the nostrils in terms of odors, 
the tongue in terms of tastes, the skin in terms of tem- 
perature, pressure, and pain. There is a specialization 
in the senses which results in division of labor, economy, 
diversity, and-effectiveness of experience. 
But the senses also codperate, furnishing simulta- 
neous impressions of the same object, as was shown in 
the exercise, where we found that some objects or situ- 
ations may be experienced simultaneously through five 
or six senses. Such coéperation leads to cae rich- 
ness, and completeness of experiences. 
Sensation and perception. — Sensation and percep- 
tion together constitute sensory ory experience. Sensa- 
tions are those elemental conscious processes which are 
ordinarily conditioned upon theffunctioning of the sense 
organs { or, as James says, The first thing in the way 
of experience.” Being aspects of consciousness, they 
9 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  Io INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
are purely mental. They do not carry meaning but 
constitute mere awareness of sense quality. Percep- 
tions, on the other hand, are the interpretations of sensa- 
tions and convey meaning. Thus, theoretically, we may 
experience redness, sweetness, fragrance, smoothness, and 
coldness, as sensations in eating an apple ; but when these 
qualities are interpreted as representing an apple we 
have a perception. It will be convenient for us to study 
the processes of sensation and perception together as 
one complex process, because in normal experience our 
consciousness is nearly always of objects rather than of 
pure qualities. 
Selective attention. — The vast mass of sense impres- 
sions pass unheeded. If you write your name slowly 
and with the greatest possible care, you will observe 
how there are present countless sensations of strain in 
joints, muscles, fingers, and arms, even extending to the 
muscles of the trunk and toes, which respond in sym- 
pathetic action with the movement of the writing hand. 
From tip to toe the whole organism is active when we 
write. All this complex of actions is reported in sen- 
sory impressions. Ordinarily these impressions of strain 
and movement which are involved in the writing of 
the name pass unnoticed. 
Likewise, if you listen intently to some interesting 
material, you will observe that, when you are inter- 
ested and off guard, your eyes are quite open; but just 
to the extent that you are interested in the things heard 
you see nothing. Of each thousand impressions made 
‘upon the eye, nine hundred and ninety-nine pass by 
unnoticed in normal life. (This is characteristic of the

function of the other senses also} and is one of the fun- 
damental expressions of economy in nature. We are 
continually bombarded through the senses with stimuli 
capable of arousing sensations; but we have acquired 
the habit of ignoring automatically those that are not 
needed. On account of the ever-presence, the faint- 
ness, the insignificance, and the vastness in number, 
(only a small per cent of the impressions from the senses 
become conscious.) The great mass(remain below the 
level of consciousness)and are regarded as(subconscious) 
Functionally they are, however, of the same kind as 
conscious perceptions and play the same kind of réle 
as conscious perceptions in the adjustment of the or- 
ganism. We regard them as mental, although not con- 
scious. 
Classification. — How many senses have we? Our 
forefathers said five; most good literature is written 
in terms of five. But modern science has revealed new 
senses. The criteria of a new sense are: (1) that it 
shall furnish us an experience not furnished by any other 
sense; (2) that it shall have a sense organ of its own; 
and (3) that this experience shall be referred specifically 
to objective conditions. Applying these criteria, we 
find at the present time that we have nine senses. These 
may be classified (psychologically, physiologically, and 
physically.) The psychological classification is based 
upon the kind of sensation; the physiological upon the 
sense.organ; and the ph physical upon the adequate physi- 
cal_stimulus. We thus obtain the three-fold classifi- 
cation which is exhibited in the parallel columns of the 
table following:

1Jn current physiology the sensory end-organs are spoken of as receptors 
and are divided into three classes: (1) the exteroceptors (external) embrace the 
end-organs in the eyes, ears, nose, and the external skin; (2) the interoceptors 
(internal) are those which are located in the internal membrances, such as those 
of the mouth, pharynx, cesophagus, stomach, and intestines; (3) the pro- 
prioceptors (deep) are primarily the end-organs of pressure and strain embodied 
in the muscles, joints, and tendons, and the end-organs of equilibrium in the 
ear. The receptors in the eye, ear, and nose are also called distance receptors.

would be if we had a sense that made us aware of all 
the electrical forces around us! Indeed, there is force 
in the aphorism: (Give me another sense, and I will 
give you another world.) 
The attributes of sensation. — We shall simplify our 
study of sensory experience greatly if we realize that 
all our knowledge of the world comes to us in four forms, 
namely :(quality, intensity, time, and space.) This fact 
gives us a logical basis for the classification of phenom- 
ena of sensory experience. Each of the senses reveals 
the world to us in terms of four attributes of sensation: 
quality (kind), intensity (quantity), duration (time), 
and extensity (space). These are the attributes of 
things. They are the forms in which we remember, 
imagine, think, and act about things. They, there- 
fore, furnish us a complete basis of classification which 
shall be maintained explicitly or implicitly throughout 
our study of psychology.? 
Quality simply means kind. Thus, we have these 
kinds of sensation: colors, brightnesses, tones, odors, 
tastes, pressures, strains, temperatures, and pains. So 
far as we know, we have no other kinds of sensation. 
Intensity merely means quantity, or strength; i.e., 
how much of the quality. In vision, intensity refers 
to the degree of light; in hearing, to the degree of loud- 
ness of the tone; in taste, to the strength of the taste; 
in pressure, to the degree of pressure, etc. Likewise, 
1 Some psychologists question this classification. Thus, it is not fully known 
whether all senses possess the attribute of extensity. Some think clearness is 
an attribute of sensation, while we regard it as an aspect of attention. Others 
claim that agreeableness and disagreeableness, as “affective tone,” are attributes 
of sensation; we regard them as feelings. These are, however, largely matters 
of terminology.
-P-A-G-E-32
ee ry oe ee 
14 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
the concept of duration is self-explanatory. It refers 
to how long the color, the tone, the taste, or any other 
sensation lasts. The nature of extensity is, however, 
not so evident. Seeing form, hearing direction, locating 
pressure, are complex matters of perception of space ; 
but the original and elemental experience of space in 
the form of sensation we call extensity. 
The sensation is its quality. Thus, awareness of 
redness is a sensation of color. The other attributes 
merely indicate variations in the intensity, the duration, 
and the extensity respectively of this quality. Yet, no 
sensation can exist without intensity; no sensation can 
exist without having some duration. It is an unsettled 
question as to whether or not we can have any sensa- 
ions which do not imply extensity. To recapitulate, 
e know the world in terms offquality (kind), intensity 
(quantity), duration (time), extensity (space)) and we 
know nothing of the world except in these four terms. 
Each sense gives us a particular kind or class of impres- 
sions, and each of these impressions may bi in (in- 
tensity, duration, and extensity.) 
The limits of the senses.—LEach sense organ is a 
limited instrument. Therefore, in each sense we have 
for each of the attributes two limits, usually called the 
upper and lower. Physically, there are tones so high 
in pitch (quality) that the ear does not register them, 
and tonal vibrations may be so slow in frequency that 
the ear does not grasp them as a tone but as individual 
puffs. Tones may be so strong (intensity) that they 
injure the ear; tones may be so faint that the ear does 
not register them. Ordinarily the ear is capable of  
-P-A-G-E-33
SENSORY EXPERIENCE 15 
hearing the shortest (duration) physical sound, e.g., 
an electric spark, and can listen indefinitely to tones 
of moderate loudness; but actual limits exist due to 
inertia and fatigue of the ear. The difference in the 
direction of tones (space) may be so small that it can- 
not be heard; tones may be so diffused that they can- 
not be located accurately. The same type of limits 
may be found for most of the other senses. 
That means that we get only a partial report from 
the outer world. In the limits of the senses nature has 
set up a medium of selection by means of which our 
consciousness is limited in large part to just the informa- 
tion we need, and we are freed from the burden of the 
infinite possibilities of non-essential impressions. On 
the other hand, it is interesting to speculate as to what 
would happen if our senses were extended; ¢.g., so that, 
instead of seeing only one octave in the rainbow of col- 
ors, we could see octave upon octave of rainbow colors 
in harmonies. 
Sensitivity. — The lower limits of each sense are meas- 
ured in terms of sensitivity, usually spoken of as the 
threshold of sensation, meaning the faintest impression 
that can be perceived. This threshold has become an 
important index and the conventional foot-rule for psy- 
chological measurements. Individuals differ in this 
sensitivity : one person may be two, ten, twenty, one 
hundred times as sensitive as another; and. this ca- 
pacity can be measured with satisfactory accuracy by 
modern methods. Thus, we can express quantitatively 
how sensitive any person is to a particular color, tone, 
taste, or pressure. Under ordinary conditions the limits
-P-A-G-E-34
    
16 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
of sensitiveness are set in the structure of the sense or- 
gan, and sensitivity is the measure of the condition of 
the organ, but there may be other causes. 
Discrimination. — Discrimination is the capacity for 
perceiving differences. It is measured in terms of the 
“least perceptible difference ” (1. p.d.). This difference 
is called the threshold of difference, or simply discrim- 
ination. Thus, the discrimination for blue is measured 
in terms of the smallest difference between two blues 
that a person can perceive. Since capacity for dis- 
crimination is an index to capacity for the use of a par- 
ticular sense, this measure assumes a coérdinate posi- 
tion with that of sensitivity in the study of individual 
differences. 
Thus, we have the two measures: sensitivity, the 
measure of capacity for receiving an impression; and 
discrimination, the measure of the capacity for differ- 
entiating impressions. Any person may be high in one 
and low in the other in any of the attributes in any of 
the senses. Measurements of these capacities enable 
us to account for many instances of success or failure, 
_ and to predict success and failure, as well as the char- 
acter of a person’s interest in things.’ 
Sensory defects.— Any defect in the sense organ, 
whether congenital or acquired, structural or functional, 
results in a corresponding loss of mental capacity, and 
literally makes the world seem different. On this point 
1A person may be totally deprived of any one or more of the senses. Thus 
we have blindness, deafness, anosmia (loss of smell), ageusia (loss of taste), 
and analgesia (loss of pain). Sensory defects are frequently congenital; but 
healthy sense organs are so delicate that even under the most favored circum- 
stances injury, deterioration, or arrested development almost invariably takes 
place to some degree before a person reaches middle age.
-P-A-G-E-35
  SENSORY EXPERIENCE 17 
students should by all means read Helen Keller’s little 
book, “‘ The World I Live In.”’ She lost sight and hear- 
ing and became dumb in infancy and has given us a 
wonderful account of the world in which she lives. She 
lives in the “ lower’ senses the life of one of the most 
intelligent, appreciative, and effective women of her 
time. The psychology of this is profoundly illuminating. 
The evolution of sense organs and sensation. — The 
evolution of sensation is parallel to the evolution of the 
sense organs. Each is conditioned by the other. The 
original sense in primitive animals was probably a bare 
sense of contact or undifferentiated touch. The animal 
endowed with this sense could guide itself to a limited 
extent with reference to objects with which it came in 
contact. Under these conditions no high degree of 
mental development would be possible. Some part of 
the skin eventually became sensitive to light, a sort of 
primitive “ chemical ” sense, and from this evolved the 
wonderful structure of the eye which gives us the sense 
of “touchata distance.” This eye was originally merely 
capable of registering light and gave neither color nor 
space. After geological ages, a crude lens was gradu- 
ally formed with the accessory mechanism necessary for 
giving information about size, form, and distance of ob- 
jects. Much later than this the primitive retina be- 
came sensitive to color by means of which the eye could 
give information about the quality of objects known 
through color. Thus seeing animals gained a mastery 
of a large environment, being able to guide themselves 
with reference to the location and character of objects 
at a distance.
-P-A-G-E-36
  18 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
But the eye functions only in light, and only in the 
direction in which the eye is turned. Animals, there- 
fore, needed another sense to guide them with reference 
to objects in the dark and behind or otherwise out of 
sight. In response to this need the ear, which had long 
been in existence as an organ of equilibrium, became 
differentiated into two parts, of which one is the organ 
of hearing. But the organism was still in vital danger 
of consuming as food something which might be inju- 
rious because the qualities of danger could not be told 
effectively through touch, sight, and hearing. The orig- 
inal organ of contact, through the “ chemical sense,” 
therefore developed a specialized organ in the mouth 
as a guardian of the alimentary canal. This became the 
sense of taste. But even taste as a guardian is of lim- 
ited capacity, because it does not inform us of the qual- 
ity until the material has been dissolved in the mouth. 
There was also need of a guardian of respiration to pro- 
tect the lungs from inhalation of noxious substances. 
For the purpose of giving information about food and 
sex objects at a distance, the original and primitive chem- 
ical senses developed specialized organs in the nose, which 
became the sense of smell, giving information about the 
nature of particles in the surrounding air and especially 
objects which might be presented to taste or touch. 
Thus smell became “taste at a distance.” And far 
back, where special muscles began to develop, the sense 
of touch became differentiated into pressure and strain. 
The former was located in the skin, the latter in the 
muscles, tendons, and joints. In a general way, the for- 
mer represents the original sense of contact, the latter its
-P-A-G-E-37
SENSORY EXPERIENCE 19 
opposite; namely, strain or pull, which gives us informa- 
tion about the position and movement of parts of the 
body. And, with further increasing need of maintain- 
ing an upright position or balance, there developed out 
of the senses of strain and pressure the system of the 
ear which constitutes the sense of equilibrium. Still 
another differentiation took place. As the organism 
developed, there came a need of a guardian of the organ- 
ism as a whole, —a sort of general guardian, both ex- 
ternal and internal, — and out of the original sensory 
contact came the new organs of pain. 
No significance should attach to the order in which 
these have been mentioned. In general it is undoubtedly 
true that there has been a gradual differentiation from 
a single primal sense which we have called the sense of 
contact. The higher evolution of all of the senses has 
been a parallel process, as a high development in one 
sense is conditioned upon corresponding development 
in other senses both mentally and physically.” 
This picture has been drawn from the point of view of 
the preservation of life; but the higher the animal, the 
larger are the needs and the means of enrichment, en- 
hancement, and enjoyment, as apprehended through 
any sense. Therefore we shall find that pleasure and 
power for varied achievement are as potent features 
as the mere need of protection and preservation in the 
evolution of the senses. One is defensive; the other 
isaggressive. Nature is prolific and generous. 
In this evolution of the sense organs and sensation, 
we establish a close relationship between man and an- 
imals. The psychologist has, therefore, a double in-

20 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
terest in the study of evolution in animals: first, the 
fascinating story of the origin and mode of develop- 
ment of the senses of man through the animal series; 
and, second, the interest in psychology of the animal 
mind itself. In general, the higher animals have the 
same number and the same kind of sense organs as 
man. Sometimes they are less differentiated, but at 
other times they may be more highly specialized and 
sensitive. The difference between man and animal in 
this respect lies not so much in the sense organs and sen- 
sory impressions themselves, as in the capacity for mak- 
ing intellectual use of them. 
Development of the senses. — Structurally the sense 
organs are perfected at birth and assume no new ca- 
pacity thereafter. The so-called development of sense 
capacities in the child consists, therefore, essentially in 
the gradual accumulation and organization of sensory 
experiences. Each new experience is set or interpreted 
in the light of all the past experiences. This process of 
developing a setting for experience results in the devel- 
opment of sensory meaning, or perception. Although 
the infant reacts to sensory stimuli at, and even before, 
birth, the impressions probably carry no meaning. The 
eye registers the signs of form, distance, and direction, 
but the infant does not see form or distance of objects. 
Recognition of objects and other relations and uses has 
to be learned gradually for each and all of the senses for 
themselves, and in codperation. In all this unfolding or 
learning, there is natural law, beautiful orderliness, and 
most unfathomable richness in the possibilities of ex- 
perience.
-P-A-G-E-39
  
CHAPTER III 
COLOR VISION 
Visual Qualities. — We live primarily in a visual 
world and most frequently think of objects as they 
“look.” Sight is the dominant intellectual sense; it 
acquaints us with objects in terms of brightness, color, 
and space. (For structure of eye see Appendix, Figs. 
28-30.) 
The eye gives us two series of visual qualities: color 
in the rich series as seen in the rainbow or the spectrum ; 
and brightness, or colorless light, as seen in the series 
of grays from black to white inclusive. Brightness is 
always present in color. For this reason it is conven- 
ient to discuss color and brightness together and to use 
either of the two terms broadly to designate the two 
series as in the heading of this chapter. 
Color may be studied from three points of view: 
physics, the nature and laws of light waves; physiology, 
the function of the eye, the nerves, and the brain in vis- 
ion; and psychology, the description and explanation 
of the nature and laws of our perception and apprecia- 
tion of color and brightness. 
The physical source of color.— Physically color is 
due to light waves of an electromagnetic nature. 
The waves to which our eyes are sensitive cover less 
than one octave, while rays of the same nature have 
ar
-P-A-G-E-40
  22 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
been recorded for about fifty-four octaves. Those of 
lower frequency, @.g., 100,000 vibrations per second 
and upward, are used in wireless telegraphy. Between 
these and the visual range we have the infra-red which 
may be registered physically, but the eye is not sensitive 
to them. Above the visual range are ultra-violet rays 
and above these are x-rays and related rays. The same 
rays that generate light also generate heat.' 
Our common names for colors are loose and arbitrary. 
A color is defined precisely in terms of the vibration fre- 
quency (thé number of trillions of vibrations per second) 
or its reciprocal, wave-length, as is shown in the follow- 
ing table. The range as here given is less than an oc- 
tave. Since we have registered more than fifty octaves

1 Light is generated by luminous bodies such as solids, liquids, and gases of 
high temperature, flames, and electrical discharges. The perception of objects 
is made possible by the indirect generation of light from non-luminous objects 
through (1) refraction, as in the rainbow, halo, and prism; (2) interference, as 
in the soap film, the opal, and Newton’s rings; (3) diffraction, as in colors inside 
shells, the corona, colors seen through eyelashes and gratings; (4) scattering, as 
in the color of the sky and sunset colors; (5) absorption, as in colored glass and 
fabrics ; (6) selective reflection, as in metals and metallic colors of certain insects; 
(7) fluorescence, as in kerosene; (8) phosphorescence, as in phosphorescent 
things; (9) interference by polarized light, as in certain crystals.

of the same kind of waves, it is interesting to speculate 
as to how the outer world would look if our eyes were 
sensitive to a wider range of colors. The analogy of 
octaves in music suggests a richness of possibilities in 
series upon series of harmonies in colors. 
The color variables. — Colors vary in three respects: 
hue, brightness, and saturation.!. The hue is the color 
quality proper; brightness denotes the relative amount 
of white light with or without color; and saturation 
denotes degree of purity of color. A color is said to 
be pure when it is caused by a specific vibration fre- 
quency; e.g., red of the wave-length 700 pp is a spe- 
cific pure red; when caused bya mixture of a consider- 
able range of wave-lengths, the color is said to be impure 
or mixed. White light or mere brightness results from 
simultaneous stimulation by all wave-lengths. Tints and 
shades are variations in brightness: when the bright- 
ness is lighter than the color at its best in greatest 
saturation, we call it a tint; when darker, a shade. 
The four colors red, green, yellow, and blue are said 
to be primary or elementary; all other colors may be 
produced by appropriate mixture of two or more of 
these. Thus, orange is a mixture of red and yellow; 
purple, of red and blue; olive, of yellow and green. The 
primary colors consist of two complementary pairs: 
red-green and yellow-blue. The complementary colors 
are always opposite or physiologically antagonistic. If 
mixed in suitable proportions, they cancel each other 
and result in mere brightness. 
1 There is great diversity of terminology on this point. The following are 
used synonymously: (1) hue, color-tone; (2) brightness, luminosity, in- 
tensity, and tint and shade; (3) saturation, purity, chroma.

  24 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
The color pyramid. — All the relations of hue, bright- 
ness, and saturation are well illustrated in the color 
pyramid, Fig.1. Let the 
spectrum of colors be 
spread in a band, red, yel- 
low, green, and _ blue, 
around the base of a 
double pyramid. On the 
theory of color mixture, 
all possible grays may be 
represented as a linear 
series of brightnesses in 
the axis white to black. 
A straight line drawn from 
any point in the spectral 
band through this axis to 
the opposite side will con- 
Fic. 1.— The color pyramid (from Cal- nect two complementary 
kins, after Titchener) colors, the mixture of 
which will result in gray. A mixture of any two colors 
of any particular brightnesses may be represented by a 
point between the two in the pyramid, showing the 
relative amount of each of the two components and 
the relative grayness of the mixture. Mixtures of col- 
ors may be represented in the surface. 
Color mixing. — The most exact method of mixing 
colors for experimental purposes is furnished by the 
spectro-photometer, an elaborate prism apparatus; 
but, for most demonstrational purposes in psychology, 
we use the color mixer, which is a motor that revolves 
interlocked color discs. This method of color mixture 
   
-P-A-G-E-43
    COLOR VISION 25 
is based upon the retinal lag; i.e., the fact that the im- 
pression of one sector lags on the retina until the wheel 
has revolved enough to expose another sector so that 
the two fuse on the retina.’ 
The following phenomena might well be demonstrated 
with the color wheel: (1) with a black and a white disc, 
produce a large number of grays from pure white to 
pure black; (2) with pairs of complementary colors, pro- 
duce neutral grays; (3) with pairs of adjacent colors, 
produce mixtures; (4) with a color and white, produce a 
series of tints; or with a color and black, produce a series 
of shades of color; (5) with a mixture of two colors and 
black, produce a shade of the mixture; (6) with a 
mixture of two colors and white, produce a tint of the 
mixture; (7) with three colors (red, green, and blue), 
produce a gray; (8) with a mixture of black and white 
on the small disc, match the brightness of red in the 
large disc; (9) with black and white on a small disc 
and black and white on the large disc, produce a series 
of steps of just noticeable difference in brightness ; 
(ro) using red and yellow in the same manner, produce 
a series of steps of just noticeable differences from red 
toward yellow; (11) take any colored fabric and match 
it on the color wheel. 
The number of colors. — Psychologically, the number 
of colors that exist is determined by the number of color 
differences that we can see, as in experiments ro and 11, 
above. Thus, under the most favorable conditions, 
trained observers can see about two hundred differences

fan motor. The kindergarten color top (Milton Bradley, Springfield, Mass.) 
costs only a few cents and will serve most of the purposes of the color wheel.

    26 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
in hue from one end of the spectrum to the other. We 
can see six or seven hundred shades of gray between 
black and white. We can probably see more than one 
hundred tints and one hundred shades of each color. 
We can see a large number of mixtures of any two or 
more non-complementary colors. Counting all these 
modes of perceptible variation, it is estimated that the 
normal person can see at least 30,000 color and bright- 
ness differences. 
Sensitivity and discrimination. — Sensitivity is meas- 
ured in terms of the least perceptible stimulation; dis- 
crimination is measured in terms of the least perceptible 
stimulus difference. Both may be illustrated with the 
color wheel. 
There are enormous differences in the sensitivity to 
color. One person may be relatively sensitive or blunt 
to any or all of the colors, ranging from most extreme 
sensitiveness, through all degrees of color weakness, to 
complete co.or-blindness for one or more of the colors. 
A person may be sensitive to color and still lack the 
power of discrimination ; i.e., the ability to make use of 
color differences. Weber’s law is to the effect that in 
general the least perceptible difference is proportional 
to the intensity of the stimulus. Thus, if we can per- 
ceive a difference of +45 in the brightness of two candle 
lights, we should expect to be able to see the difference 
of roo in the brightness of two arc lights. This law is 
found to be very useful in practical affairs.

Brightness and color contrast. 
EXERCISE. — (1) Cut two narrow strips about 5 mm. wide from a 
piece of uniform gray paper or cloth. Lay one upon a white surface 
and the other upon a black surface, and if available cover them with a 
sheet of tissue paper and observe that the gray on the black background 
is very much lighter than the gray on the white background. This is 
the phenomenon of brightness contrast. (2) In the same manner 
take two strips of color and lay them on different colored backgrounds, 
covering them with tissue paper, and observe that the color of each 
of the colored strips has changed in the direction of the complemen- 
tary color of the background.| Write a brief report. 
Among the countless illusions of color, that of con- 
trast is undoubtedly the most persistent and significant. 
Every hue and brightness in nature and art is modified 
by adjacent hues and brightnesses in the direction of 
the greatest opposition. Usually we speak of the larger 
surface as the inducing area and the smaller as the in- 
duced; but the effect is reciprocal, although it is pro- 
portionately greater for the smaller area. 
The laws of contrast are well known and may be seen. 
to operate in nature and art wherever colors or lights 
occur on contiguous surfaces. They: must be regarded 
for appropriate effects in all art, decoration, dress, etc. 
Thus, by placing a red upon a green background, it is 
possible to produce a more brilliant red than could other- 
wise be produced. A tint of an undesirable color may be 
cancelled by placing around it a patch of the same color. 
All colors may be enhanced or softened by introducing 
appropriate contrasts. 
The contrast effect is strongest at the adjacent mar-

mentary Experiments in Psychology.

gins. It may be enhanced, e.g., by extreme differences 
in color and brightness, by looking only for a short time, 
by a large inducing and a small induced field, by prox- 
imity of the two fields, by softness of contour and the 
blurring of edges. 
After-images. 
Exercise. — (1) Make a black ink blot about the size of a dime on a 
sheet of white paper. Fixate it; i.e., look at it without moving the 
eye, from five to twenty seconds; then turn quickly and look at one 
point on some neutral surface, such as a gray wall, and for a few sec- 
onds you will see the blot not black but white. (2) Fixate as before, 
but in this case close your eyes and project the after-image somewhere 
im space in front. of your closed. eyes. Fixate it again and project 
the image upon the white paper a short distance away from the dot. 
You will see the black dot as a white dot whiter than the paper. 
(3) Similarly fixate a bit of bright color in these three ways, and in 
each case you will see the object in the complementary color. These 
images are negative after-images of color. Write a brief report. 
Here we are dealing with a universal tendency in light ; 
namely, the tendency of impressions to persist after the 
stimulation has ceased. There are after-images of color 
and after-images of brightness. Each of these is of two 
kinds, positive and negative. In the positive after-image 
the color and brightness are similar to the original; in 
the negative they are opposite; i.e., brightness is re- 
versed and colors appear in their complementaries. 
Under strong stimulation after-images recur as often 
as six or eight times after a single stimulation. In such 
a series the positive and negative after-images alternate. 
The positive after-image appears first and is of very short 
duration and, therefore, is not easily observable by a 
beginner; after a blank, this is followed by a negative
-P-A-G-E-47
  COLOR VISION 29 
image, which may last from one to fifteen seconds at a 
time. Pure hues and intense brightness produce the 
most marked effects. A fixation time of five to twenty 
seconds is favorable, although it varies with many con- 
ditions, especially with training. The image of a small 
and sharply defined object is more readily observed 
than that of a large or ill-defined object. The effect 
is best when the image is projected upon the background 
differing from it in brightness and hue. The hue and 
brightness of the image always mix with the hue and 
brightness of the surface upon which they are projected. 
The relative brightness and saturation of the image 
depend upon the intensity and saturation of the stimulus. 
We must not think of the after-image as occurring 
only under such specific conditions. It is ever-present 
in normal vision. The after-image of one object is pro- 
duced upon the next object; or, if we continue to fixate 
one color or light, it modifies this color or light. The 
result is that things look different according as we see 
them after other objects or for a certain duration of 
time. In ordinary life we do not notice these phenom- 
ena, partly because the effects are so countless and ap- 
parently chaotic, and partly because we do not look for 
them or recognize them when we see them. In viewing 
a bouquet of variegated colors, the image of each color 
and light affects our perception of the next.t 
1 This explains many bothersome phenomena of vision. In church, e.g., 
the listener may observe strange and persistent figures, moving across a blank 
wall. By a little effort he may be able to trace this “writing on the wall” to 
the organ pipes, the flag, flowers, a bit of white drapery, a black draping, etc. 
The form can be recognized; the figures move with the eye. Many ghosts, 
visions, and apparently miraculous appearances have been made of this inno- 
cent stuff.
-P-A-G-E-48
    
30 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
Adaptation. — The positive after-image is due to a 
persistence of the same physiological processes which 
occur in primary vision. Negative after-images are 
local effects of the general phenomenon of adaptation 
in the retinal elements. Indeed, after-images have been 
defined as localized adaptation. The short duration of 
an after-image and the shift from positive to negative 
are due to a fundamental tendency to periodic action in 
the retina. Even in the after-image of white light the 
complete cycle of colors, sometimes called “ the flight 
of color,’ may be seen periodically. In general, the 
law of adaptation is to the effect that under prolonged 
stimulation black and white tend toward a uniform gray, 
and colors tend in the direction of mere brightness. 
When we go from a dark room into a bright light, the 
light is harsh; when we go from a light room into a dark 
room, the darkening is striking, but in both cases the 
eye soon adapts itself. This is due partly to contrac- 
tion or expansion of the pupil, but more fundamentally 
to the change in the retinal elements. The same is true 
about color. Wear green spectacles for a while and 
the objects at first so harshly green soon lose their 
color. A highly colored object or environment is 
much more impressive at first than after reasonable 
adaptation. 
Closely related to this is the phenomenon of twilight 
vision as distinguished from daylight vision. Colors 
appear very different in dim light from what they do in 
bright light. In daylight yellow is the brightest color, 
but in twilight green is the brightest. As darkness 
comes on the colors of the spectrum gradually vanish.
-P-A-G-E-49

The retinal light. 
EXERCISE.— Close your eyes and cover them well and observe that 
under these conditions you will see a most gorgeous display of colors. 
There are countless patches or masses moving continually in kaleido- 
scopic change. The better the eye is darkened the more striking is 
the display. Write a brief report. 
This is the phenomenon of retinal light or “ own- 
light”’ of the retina. It is caused by the internal stimu- 
lation of the retina, e.g., by circulation and metabolism. 
At night in a dark room these colors become conspicuous 
and have been called the “ stuff that dreams are made 
of.” The causes of these phenomena are present in 
daylight, but the effects are drowned out by the flood of 
daylight and meaningful impressions. 
Color fields. ‘ 
Exercise. — (r) Take a white paper about an inch square and, 
holding it out at arm’s length, bring it into the field of vision gradually 
from the left, using the left eye only, and observe how far out you can 
see it when the eye is fixed upon an object straight in front. (2) 
Try bits of colored paper in the same way and observe that colors do 
not first appear in their true color and that the limits for seeing the 
true color are different for different colors. By repeating this on 
several radii we may map the field of vision for each color and for 
white. Write a brief report. 
The retina is like the sensitive plate of the camera 
in that a copy of the external object is thrown upon it. 
The most sensitive point of the retinal screen is called 
the fovea; the outer edges, the periphery; the field be- 
tween the fovea and the periphery, the indirect field. We 
may speak either of the retinal area or of its reciprocal, 
the visual field. There are three clearly recognized 
zones in the retina, as shown in Fig. 2. The outermost,

in to Y —B, is sensitive to light only. In this -re- 
gion both light and colors appear gray. The middle 
zone is the yellow-blue zone. Here lights and grays are

      seen approximately in their true brightness and the 
colors yellow and blue with all their derivatives and 
mixtures may also be seen. The innermost zone is 
red-green. Here all colors and brightnesses may be 
seen, and with approximate correctness as we approach 
the fovea. The significance of this zonal arrangement 
with respect to evolution of color and the explanation 
of color-blindness will be seen presently. 
1This figure is in accord with the Hering theory. The facts upon which 
it is based are exceedingly complicated both in theory and observation, and a 
great diversity of opinion prevails.
-P-A-G-E-51
COLOR VISION 33 
Among the laws of indirect color vision are the fol- 
lowing: All colors are seen at their best in the central 
field, at the fovea. The outer limits for the field of red- 
green coincide; the outer limits for the yellow-blue 
field coincide; the yellow-blue field is always the larger. 
All colors and lights enter from the periphery as grays 
in the outermost zone. All colors, except the four pri- 
mary colors, go through definite cycles of change when 
passing anywhere through the two color zones. The 
saturated, primary colors, red, green, yellow, and blue, 
do not change in hue in indirect vision. All colors when 
seen by indirect vision go through a definite series of 
changes, covering the complete cycle of the spectrum 
in a very few seconds; i.e., the colors in the indirect 
field are very unstable and the process of adaptation i is 
very rapid, but follows definite laws. 
The blind spot. 
Exercise. — Look steadily with the left eye only toward an object 
straight in front and, starting in this line of regard, move a small coin 
slowly to the left at arm’s length until the coin disappears (at about 
20° or 30° out). This blind spot corresponds to the small area in the 
retina which is blind because the optic nerve enters there. Observe 
and state how we fill this absolute blind spot in normal vision. 
These phenomena of indirect vision add enormously 
to the complexity of our color vision. If we could ob- 
serve a surface uniformly colored and uniformly lighted 
in all parts for a few seconds, we should see simulta- 
neously at any moment all the colors of the spectrum, and 
the whole color mass would be in constant flux accord- 
ing to a definite law of change for each degree of indi- 
rect vision.
-P-A-G-E-52
  34 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
The periphery of the retina is more sensitive to light 
and movement than the central field. This is of bio- 
logical significance because the outer fields serve as 
scouts picking up indications of approaching objects. 
On the other hand, the central retina registers space 
and color more accurately. Hence, whenever we want 
to see an object we automatically turn the eyes so as 
to throw the image upon the fovea. This is a most 
wonderful mechanism of specialization and economy, 
leaving a large area sensitive for scouting and a small 
central area highly developed and not easily fatigued 
for the accurate perception of objects. 
Physiological theories of color vision. — The full ex- 
planation of color vision includes an account of (r) the 
nature of the experience, (2) the laws of color vision, 
(3) its evolution, (4) the natural physical stimulus, and 
(5) the nature of the physiological process. At this 
last stage we strike the greatest difficulty in that, while 
there is a mass of excellent experimental evidence at 
hand, there is no general agreement in regard to the 
nature of the mechanism and its evolution. Each and 
every phenomenon of color vision has its physiological 
explanation; but in many respects physiologists simply 
do not know at the present time just what it is. 
On certain facts, however, all are agreed. The end- 
organs of color vision are found in the retina, primarily 
in the layer of rods and cones. These receptors are sen- 
sitive to electromagnetic waves of approximately 400 
to 800 trillion vibrations per second. Each particular 
vibration frequency results in a specific color: from 
the red at the lowest frequency up to the violet at the
-P-A-G-E-53
  
COLOR VISION 35 
highest. Light or brightness is ordinarily caused by the 
simultaneous stimulation by all vibration frequencies 
within the spectrum. Each specific frequency also has 
an inherent light or brightness value, yellow being the 
brightest and blue the darkest in good daylight. There 
is probably a small number of specific color elements 
which correspond to the primary colors: according to 
the Young-Helmholtz theory three, red, green, and blue; 
according to the Hering theory three pairs, red-green, 
yellow-blue, and black-white. For every phase of color 
experience there must be a corresponding physiological 
condition in the physio-chemical changes in these ele- 
ments. 
The evolution of color vision. — The first stage of 
the light organ was probably merely a light-sensitive 
spot of pigment at the surface of a simple organism. 
This gradually differentiated into a specific light-sensi- 
tive group of cells. These spread on the inside of a 
gradually formed eyeball, and became the retina. This 
retina was probably first sensitive to movement and to 
light only; but gradually a new function was taken on 
— that of yellow-blue vision. The animal at this stage 
could see light, or white, and yellow-blue and all their 
derivatives. Geological ages later another differentia- 
tion took place, and the central part of the retina became 
sensitive to red-green and its derivatives. Each color 
element started at the center of the retina and gradually 
spread outward. Thus it is that the yellow-blue field 
of color is larger than the red-green, which has not had 
time to grow out so far. 
Color-blindness. — About four men in a hundred 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  36 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
and about one-tenth as many women are color-blind. 
The commonest form of color-blindness is red-green 
blindness. A red-green blind person cannot tell the 
strawberry from its leaves by color. Reds and greens 
are alike to him, although there are many gradations of 
the red-green type. Since all colors that we encounter 
in nature or fabrics are mixed, the red-green-blind per- 
son sees not the reds and greens of the ingredients, but 
the yellows and the blues. Pure red and pure green he 
sees as grays. A color-blind person may pass through 
life without ever discovering that he is color-blind. He 
may use the names, and he ordinarily thinks that other 
persons see colors as he sees them. Red-green color- 
blindness finds a natural explanation in the biological 
law that the last-acquired traits or capacities are the 
least stable, and therefore the first to be lost: specifi- 
cally, red-green vision is the last acquired, and it is the 
first to be lost. Some claim that we cannot have yel- 
low-blue blindness without also having red-green blind- 
ness. 
There are many other forms of color-blindness. The 
extreme form is total color-blindness. Persons so af- 
flicted see no colors. What is to us a richly colored world 
they see in blacks, grays, and whites, as in a photograph. 
On account of the uncertainty in color theories, there is 
much dispute in regard ‘to the classification of types of 
color-blindness. In turn, color-blindness has offered the 
best opportunity for testing the validity of color theo- 
ries. 
True color-blindness is hereditary. In some pecul- 
iar way it is a sex-linked trait; it is prevailingly men
-P-A-G-E-55
COLOR VISION SiG 
that are color-blind, but this trait is transmitted on the 
female side; e.g., the daughter of a color-blind man, 
though not herself color-blind, may transmit the trait 
to her sons, while the son of the color-blind man will not 
be color-blind and will not transmit the trait. True 
color-blindness is not curable. It is due to congenital 
condition in the visual elements of the retina. Anal- 
ogous defects may, however, be acquired and may then 
be curable. Tobacco blindness, e.g., usually attacks 
the central region of the retina causing the person suffer- 
ing from this ailment to acquire the habit of viewing 
objects in indirect vision when he wants to see colors; 
but abatement of the use of nicotine may result in re- 
covery. 
A mild form of color-blindness, very common indeed, 
is called color weakness. It may be weakness for one, 
two, or more elements and may be in any degree from 
true color-blindness to normal vision. Seamen, rail- 
road men, and others, whose signals are given in color, 
are now tested for color-blindness as a protection to life ; 
but, in the interest of efficiency and safety, tests for 
color weakness as described under sensitivity and dis- 
crimination may be even more important. 
Color vision in animals. — The color vision of animals 
can be investigated by the behavior methods; i.e., an- 
imals are taught to associate something desired, such as 
food, with a color signal, and by varying the signal it is 
possible to measure roughly the discrimination for color 
and for brightness. In these experiments it is extremely 
important to control the brightness as well as the hue 
and saturation, because all higher animals have some
-P-A-G-E-56
38 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
degree of brightness discrimination and colors can be 
distinguished by their brightness. In general, although 
there is some experimental evidence in the negative, it 
seems possible that the higher animals have color vision 
somewhat analogous to the human. Birds have a ret- 
ina quite like our own, but their spectrum seems to be 
shorter at the violet end. Reptiles resemble birds in 
color vision. No clear case of color vision has been found 
in fish. ’ 
Evolution of color vision in the race. — Historic 
man, of all ages, has probably possessed a form of color 
vision characteristic of present man so far as the mech- 
anism is concerned, because many of the higher animals 
have it and there is no important difference in principle. 
Primitive man probably guided himself by color, as 
animals do, without being conscious of the color in itself 
or having names for colors. In all primitive races color 
names have arisen gradually, beginning with distinc- 
. tions between light and color, then differentiating more 
and more colors in turn as they become prominent in 
experience. Untutored people confuse color and bright- 
ness. Red is the color which first attracts the attention 
of primitive man. The reason for the early conscious- 
ness of red lies partly in the inherent exciting nature of 
red, in its association with fire, blood, and brilliancy in 
an object, and in its rareness as compared with the blue 
of the sky and of the sea and verdant nature. The 
ability to use names of colors is gradually acquired by 
persistent education of the race. The common man 
of to-day has far to go in this respect. 
Development of color vision in the child. — The color
-P-A-G-E-57
COLOR VISION 30 
vision mechanism is probably completely evolved at 
birth, and aside from minor physiological adjustments, 
it is quite certain that the child is sensitive to colors soon 
after birth. There is experimental evidence to show 
that the child sees all the colors at the age of three 
months, if not before. But, as in the evolution of the 
race, so in the development of the child, the conscious- 
ness of color, the use of color, the organized knowledge 
about colors, and precision in the observation of color 
vision is a gradual development. Common people see 
and use colors with an awful crudeness. Art and edu- 
cation are practically limitless in their possibility for the 
refinement of knowledge, appreciation, and use of colors.

CHAPTER IV 
VISUAL SPACE 
We do not have sensations of space; we perceive 
space. What we sense of the outer world is visual qual- 
ities of brightness and color and the quality of strain 
in eye balance and movement; the awareness of visual 
space relations is an act of interpretation of these. It 
is a complex act of perception. 
If we look into the clear blue sky with no form or lim- 
its in view, the brightness and blueness of the sky seem 
to have an inherent bigness. This attribute of bigness, 
or extensity, may be regarded as the spatial attri- 
bute of sensation which forms the nucleus of our visual 
space. 
The planes or dimensions of space. — Psychologically, 
there are two dimensions of space; the first dimension 
at right angles to the line of regard, and the second di- 
mension, parallel with the line of regard. In general, 
points in the first plane indicate direction ; in the second, 
distance. All other space relations may be regarded as 
combinations of these two. Within the first dimen- 
sion we recognize form, size, direction or position, and 
movement; within the second, distance, relief or per- 
spective, and volume. Space in the first dimension 
is seen with one eye; but adequate perception of

The retinal image. — The mechanism for the image 
formation consists of (1) the iris diaphragm, which limits 
the amount of light that shall be admitted through the 
pupil; (2) the lens system, which bends the rays of 
light in such a way as to bring them to a focus upon the 
retina; and (3) the retina, upon which the image of the 
object is to be projected. The light waves striking the 
area of the image set up nerve impulses which are trans- 
mitted to the brain in such a way as to serve as a sign of 
location. ‘Local sign” is that special character of a 
sensation whereby we are enabled to refer it to a partic- 
ular place, “ that differential quality of a sensation which 
varies with the part of the sensitive surface stimulated, 
but not with the nature of the stimulus.” (Stout) 
Accommodation. — The adjustment of the lens for 
varying distances, as in the focusing of a camera, is called 
accommodation. It is accomplished by a change in the 
curvature of the lens through the action of the ciliary 
muscle on the capsule in which the lens is suspended. 
As in the camera the eye can secure a clear image only 
at one distance at a time. d : 
Defects in the lens system lead to corresponding de- 
fects in vision, called errors of refraction: (1) myopia, 
or nearsightedness, in: which the focal length of the lens

color must be so constructed that changes in the quantity, quality, local color-

system is too short; (2) hyperopia, or farsightedness, in 
which the lens system is too long; and (3) presbyopia, or 
old-sightedness, in which the focusing lens is hardened ; 
and (4) astigmatism, in which there is unevenness in the 
surface of the cornea or the lens. These and many other 
eye defects are becoming more prevalent under the mod- 
ern conditions of eye-strain and nervous pressure. 
Eye-movement.— As we may register observed dif- 
ferences in direction in terms of degrees of a surveying 
instrument, so we register direction of the turning of the 
eyeball in terms of energy of eye-emovement. The eye- 
ball is delicately suspended and can be turned in any di- 
rection within its range by means of the six large muscles. 
In normal vision the eye is in lively motion. We can 
readily observe these movements, but ‘they are much 
finer and more numerous and rapid than we ordinarily 
realize, as is demonstrated by motion pictures of the 
eye in reading or in looking steadily at a single object. 
What happens in ordinary vision is that the eye takes a 
vast series of snapshot views from different positions, 
so that what we really see is the summation of these 
pictures in a single mental picture or percept. In see- 
ing, ¢.g., the passing of a vehicle, size is registered in 
terms of the angle of eye-movement, position or direc- 
tion from the observer at a given movement in terms of 
the turning of the eyeball from its point of rest, direc- 
tion and rate of movement in terms of eye-movement 
in following the object. 
Secondary criteria. — There are many secondary cri- 
teria by which a person with one eye can get a serviceable 
interpretation or inference about space in the second

dimension. (1) Knowledge of size: we know the approx- 
imate size of common objects, and knowledge of approx- 
imate size furnishes approximate knowledge of distance.’ 
(2) Shading: the toning of the color and brightness sug- 
gests relief in a natural object as in apicture. (3) Sen- 
sations of accommodation: the strain of accommoda- 
tion is an index to distance within a limited range.’ 
(4) Clearness*: fine detail can be seen inversely in pro- 
' portion to the distance. (5) Relation to known objects: 
shadows, objects in front or behind one another, motion, 
and many other circumstances in the relation of one object 
to another may be an indication of distance. Therefore, 
while lacking the proper means of seeing space in the 
second plane, a one-eyed person can guide himself quite 
effectively by sight and enjoy the feeling, more or less 
illusory, that he sees distance. 
BINOCULAR SPACE 
Exercise. — (a) Hold a pencil twelve inches in front of the eyes and 
a finger at arm’s length. Fixate the pencil with the two eyes and ob- 
serve that you see two fingers. Fixate the fingers and you will see 
two pencils. State why. 
(b) Hold a closed book at arm’s length upright and with back toward 
you. Look first with one eye and then with the other, and then ob- 
serve that each eye gives a different view of the book. State why. 
1A blindfolded person was taken into a dark room in which he could see 
nothing but a one-half inch disc of red light. Asked to judge the size and 
distance of the object with one eye uncovered, he hesitated: ‘If it is near, it is 
small; if it is large, itis faraway. Thatisfunny! It may be the size of a pea, 
or a saucer, or a cartwheel!” 
2 This might be regarded as a primary criterion. 
3 Difference in clearness of the atmosphere called aérial perspective affects 
judgment of distances. Two men in a fishing party were standing on shore in 
the early evening and, as a third man stood up in his boat waving a lantern, 
one said to the other, “How tall is Bill?” ‘‘About seventeen feet,” was the 
prompt reply. “That is the way he looks to me,” said the inquirer. The fog 
had come up at dusk. Explain in terms of geometry.

  44 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
With two eyes we see space in the first dimension, 
just as with one eye; and we have the same secondary 
criteria for interpreting distance. But with two eyes 
we see space truly in the second dimension by means of 
disparate images and binocular movements. 
Double images. — Experiment a above illustrated the 
phenomenon of double images. Each eye gave a dif- 
ferent image, the difference corresponding to the differ- 
ence in angle between the two lines of regard. We are 
not conscious of these images,— their oneness or two- 
ness, or their difference, — but we are conscious of 
objects in relief at a given distance, because we have ac- 
quired the power of automatically interpreting the two 
impressions as being different views of the same object. 
As in.surveying, two readings of an object furnish data 
for the determination of distance. Relief or depth and 
volume are secondary aspects of distance. 
Convergence. — The turning inward of the two eyes to 
fixate an object is called convergence and the turning out- 
ward to the parallel position, divergence. The angular 
difference in view from the two eyes is called the bi- 
nocular parallax. The sensations of these turning move- 
ments in this binocular adjustment are an index to dis- 
tance. Distant objects are seen with the eyes relatively 
parallel; near objects by more or less convergence. 
We can converge the eyes upon only one object at a 
time. We can, therefore, see clearly only one point at a 
time in distance. All other points give double images 
as in Experiment a. If we look at one personin the center 
of an audience, all persons seated nearer to, or farther 
away from, this person should be seen double. Yet
-P-A-G-E-63
VISUAL SPACE e 45 
normally we are not aware of such confusion, largely 
because we have learned to pay attention to the object 
we fixate and neglect all confusing impressions; and 
the eyes normally change rapidly in accommodation 
and convergence for difference in distances. In rapid 
movements for differences in distance, we take snapshot 
focal impressions in the second plane just as in the first. 
What we see is a summation of focal images, really a 
composite picture set together in memory. 
Briefly in seeing objects in color and space, we are not 
aware of light waves, nerve impulses, images! on the ret- 
ina, or sensations of eye movements: we see objects di- 
rectly as we have become acquainted with them through 
different senses, and as they have meaning to us. 
External projection. — This giving of meaning to sen- 
sations or automatically registered impressions is well 
illustrated in the law of external projection: the ray of 
light is referred back into space along the line of inci- 
dence.? The bearing of that on the correct perception 
of objects is self-evident. 
1In accordance with optical principles the image on the retina is inverted. 
Professor Stratton wore a pair of prisms in front of his eyes in such a way that 
everything was seen inverted. He encountered difficulty in eating soup; the 
bowl hung inverted. In going upstairs the opening of the stairway yawned 
downward and he had to step upward. After a week he gradually ceased to 
see things inverted and began to see them as he experienced them before. When 
he gave up wearing the prisms he had to unlearn the new-found associations, 
showing that upright vision is purely a matter of association and learning. 
2 The principle of external projection has become so insistent that it operates 
even for lights that originate within the eye. Wave a wax taper gently at the 
side of one eye in a darkened room and observe that you will see, as on a screen 
before you, a rich network. This is the shadow, a true picture of the blood 
vessels in the retina. Press the eyeball gently on the side and you will see dark 
moving rings in front of you. These are due to the mere pressure on the eye- 
ball. Squint at the distant sky through the partly closed eyelids of one eye and 
observe the “floating flakes” and snowball effect. These flakes are the shadows 
of floating opaque particles in the eye. In all these cases the normal habit of 
external projection leads us to see these phenomena as outside of the eye in space.
-P-A-G-E-64
46 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
Stereoscopic vision. — Stereoscopic vision furnishes a 
good confirmation of our explanation of binocular vi- 
sion. Pictures are flat, but if we take two pictures of 
the same object at an appropriate angle and carry one 
view to each eye separately. through prisms which make 
the eye converge, we see relief and perspective, imitat- 
ing the normal binocular perception of relief. 
Vision is, after all, an interpretation of fragmentary 
visual cues. The more familiar we are with the situation, 
the less of the cue we need. In normal seeing of objects 
as well as pictures and print, the interpretation hinges 
on most slender and inadequate sensory data. The 
saving feature is that we see things as they ought to 
be, as we know them to be, or as is reasonable and nat- 
ural. 
NorMat Visuat ILLUSIONS OF SPACE 
Things are not what they seem. Nature’s sleight of 
hand furnishes most fascinating instruction and enter- 
tainment to him whose mind’s eye is open to it; and, 
in all this bewildering ever presence of error, there is 
law and order: there is law in illusion. When the il- 
lusions are fairly fixed, uniform, and predictable, we 
call them normal. The study of such normal visual il- 
lusions teaches us to predict, explain, enjoy, and cor- 
rect the distortions of objects as seen, and it throws 
much light on the nature of the visual process itself. 
We can here give merely a few illustrations of geomet- 
rical illusions of visual space and shall not attempt any 
complete classification.

Terminal illusions. 
EXERCISE. — (a) Place three coins of the same denomination in 
a row edge to edge. Take out the middle one and slide it over to the 
right, in the same line, to such a distance that the distance between 
the middle and the right-hand coin shall seem to be equal to the origi- 
nal distance across the three coins. Measure and record the error in 
per cent. 
(0) Place the three coins in the first position above and move the 
middle coin out away from you to such a position that the distance 
between the adjacent edges of it and each of the other coins shall seem 
to be equal to the original distance across the three coins. Measure 
and record the error in per cent. 
(c) Place two coins in line, pointing away from you so that the 
distance between them shall seem to be equal to the diameter of one 
coin. Measure and record the error in per cent. 
The explanation of the terminal illusion involves a 
complex set of motives of which one may operate in 
some forms of the figure and another in other forms; 
often several motives coéperate. In judging linear dis- 
tances we tend to confuse pure line distance with sug- 
gested area of extension. Thus, in the above exercise, 
the arcs of the coins are the “ terminals ” of the distance 
measured: if the terminals turn toward each other, the 
distance is shortened ; if they turn away from each other, 
the distance is lengthened. This general principle may 
in turn be traced to specific motives, such as eye move- 
ments, irradiation, perspective, or “ filled space,’”’ which 
we cannot here stop to explain. 
The situation in Experiment 6 is illustrated in Fig. 3, A. 
You probably placed the middle coin in the position 
here shown; but to be right, it should have been placed 
above the dot in the circle above. Fig. 3, B, illustrates

48 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
the same principle, where angle lines are used as term- 
inals. The two base lines are equal, but the lower one 
seems to be about 13 per cent shorter. The force of the 
illusion varies with the character of the terminal, which 
may take a countless variety of forms. 
To illustrate the fixed rdle of this illusion in design, 
look at carpets, napkins, wall papers, dress goods — any-

where in art and decoration or nature, where linear dis- 
tances are marked off by terminal objects or forms — 
and you will see these illusions. It is very interesting 
to find that in wall paper design, for instance, the artist 
has taken the illusion into account and made the ap- 
propriate correction in order to get such apparent spac- 
ing effects as 1:1, 1: 2, or 1: 1.62 (the golden section). 
Fig. 4 illustrates this illusion in a design: the distance 
between the two globelike figures looks equal to the di- 
ameter of each of the’figures, but is 14 per cent shorter. 
The artist may not know the quantitative force of the

illusion and may not be aware of its nature, or even its 
existence; but, in designing, he stands off and sketches 
to suit his eye and, in so doing, corrects for the illusion. 
Designs built of two, three, or four unit groups or lines, 
circles, triangles, or any other form, as in the above ex- 
ercises, may be of any degree of complexity, but will 
always embody the illusion. Indeed, the more irregular

the figure is, the more effective the illusion will be; for 
this reason the illusion is more effective in the freedom 
of nature than in the restrictions of geometrical draw- 
ings.?

check the dot that the short slanting line in Fig. 5, A, would appear 
to strike if continued as a straight line to the dotted line. Record 
number of dot, counting from the bottom.

to strike if continued to the arc above as a straight line. Record num- 
ber, counting from the left. 
Now lay on a straight edge and determine the amount of illusion 
for each figure. 
Small angles are always overestimated. The two 
cases in the exercise represent two of the fundamental

types of these illusions which occur in nature and art 
wherever small angles exist. 
The reliable observer will mark the dot about 8 mm. 
too high in A, and about 4 mm. too far to the left in B. 
The rigidity of this illusion is illustrated in Fig. 6, A, 
which is a square inscribed in a circle. You can see a 
perfect square with an indented circle or a perfect circle 
with a caved-in square; you cannot see a perfect circle 
and a perfect square at the same time. The fact that ee B Fic. 5. — Small angle illusions

the distortion is forced under such rigid conditions of 
drawings, as in these illustrations, is a most severe test 
of the principle. In Fig. 6, B, the upper right-hand slant- 
ing line seems to point the continuation of the upper 
left slanting line, but the lower is correct. 
Association illusions. 
Exercise. — Draw a horizontal line of any length and, at the mid- 
dle of it, erect a vertical line such that it shall seem to be of the same 
length as the horizontal line. Measure the error. Then draw the 
line to scale and observe that it does not look right.

Fic. 6. — Small angle illusions 
The very gross constant error in this exercise is due 
partly to the tendency to compare the vertical line with 
one-half of the horizontal. The silk hat in Fig. 7, A, is 
a good illustration of the combination of several motives 
in producing a large illusion. The height of the crown 
is equal to the smallest diameter; but, on the average, 
it seems to be about 18 per cent greater. The two seg- 
ments in Fig. 7, B, are of exactly the same shape and size.

ber and characterize difficulties encountered. 
Figs. 8 and 9 are ambiguous:! as we look at them 
“ steadily,” they suddenly shift and take an entirely 
different form and position. We have formed the habit 
of thinking that the first point of an object that catches

this determines which of the alternate views we shall 
see. The eyes are never still for any considerable time ; 
therefore the view should change several times a second. 
But there is a lag for interpretation in perception, so 
that probably it seems to change only every few seconds. 
This illusion of reversible perspective is a specific case” 
of the general law of apperception, as are really all 
illusions. 
General principles of illusions. — Visual illusions may 
be divided roughly into two classes: those that may be

force; the force of the illusion has been very much re-

tinguish between what we actually see and what we know

of a motive is usually due to the counteraction of op- 
posing motives. Likewise, very large effects are usu- 
ally due to the codperation of two or more motives; 
in a common object we may have five or ten motives, 
some counteracting, some coéperating as in Fig. 7 A.

The lesson from this sampling of illusions should be 
that there are illusions in all our normal vision, that they 
occur according to law and order, that knowledge of them

  _ CHAPTER V . 
HEARING 
Hearinc is dominantly the sense of tone and time. 
All sounds may be described completely in terms of qual- 
ity, intensity, duration, and extensity of sensation; 7.e., 
pitch, loudness, time, and space in the complex forms of 
perception. The quality of sound is pitch, which cor- 
responds to the physical vibration frequency. The in- 
tensity of sound is loudness, which corresponds to the~ 
amplitude or force of vibration. The duration of a, 
sound corresponds to the duration of vibration. Ex- 
tensity corresponds to the length of the sound wave. 
From these four elemental aspects of hearing, we derive 
the complex forms of perception, such as timbre, noise, 
rhythm, and volume.’ (For structure of the ear see Ap- 
pendix, Figs. 31-34.) 
Pircu 
The nature of pitch. — Pitch is the tonal aspect of 
sound, the essence of what we hear. Intensity, duration, 
and extensity of sound are only variables of this quality. 
Timbre and tonal fusion are mere complexes of pitch. 
Though the vibration is the cause of a tone, we are not 
ordinarily conscious of vibrations at all: we hear sounds, 
1 The ear is a sensitive mechanism the function of which is to receive, vary, 
and transmit certain vibrations and to transform these into nerve impulses which 
are conditioned by the frequency, form, amplitude, aid duration of the vibra- 
tion, and which are the physiological correlates of the attributes of sound sensa- 
tions; viz., quality, intensity, duration, and extensity. 
55
-P-A-G-E-74
  56 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
tone, pitch. This is a marvelous transformation. The 
organism registers all the intricacies of vibration and, 
by the magic “ from matter to mind,” we hear a cor- 
responding wealth in variety of sound in terms of tonal 
meaning and can make as fine distinctions in tonal hear- 
ing as one-fifth of a vibration without being aware of a 
vibration. Still, for the science of hearing, we must 
analyze and explain in terms of vibration. 
The physiological basis of pitch. — No theory of the 
anatomy and physiology of the pitch-differentiating 
mechanism in the ear has been fully established. The 
harp theory maintains that there is a mechanism in the 
ear which differentiates pitch; but there are divergent 
theories as to the location and the mechanism of such 
harp structure. Early investigators maintained that the 
basilar membrane serves this purpose; but some physi- 
ologists ascribe this function to the tectorial membrane. 
We have no conclusive proof for either theory, although 
the support for the basilar membrane theory seems to be 
the stronger. Possibly there is an element of truth in 
each theory and the two membranes codperate. It is 
thought that the harp structure is capable of being tuned 
to as many pitches as the human ear can hear; so that, 
when a particular vibration frequency is conveyed to it 
by the liquid of the inner ear, a particular segment will 
vibrate sympathetically because tuned to that frequency, 
and other parts will remain quiescent. The end-organ 
of hearing is the spiral layer of hair-cells which is so lo- 
cated that the cells will be physically stimulated by 
transmitted sound waves. The mechanical vibration 
at any particular frequency of the harp “ strings ” pro-
-P-A-G-E-75
  
HEARING 57 
duces a chemical change in a cell, which results in a nerve 
impulse that is transmitted over a special nerve fiber 
from that cell to a particular part of the brain. 
The ear is a most wonderful mechanism with its mem- 
branes, levers, and liquid conductors carrying the vibra- 
tion to the harp structure, its means of analysis of all 
pitches in that structure, and its means of transmission 
of each pitch over its particular line to the brain. For 
- psychological purposes it is necessary to make certain 
assumptions, of which the essential one is that there is 
a pitch-differentiating mechanism in the ear which is so 
organized that it is capable of serving as a physical 
basis for the sensory phenomena with which we deal in 
the psychology of hearing; namely, pitch, intensity, 
timbre, volume, fusion, and consonance, and their de- 
rivatives or variants. r 
The lower limit of pitch. — Vibrations must reach a 
certain frequency before they can form a tone. Under 
most favorable conditions, with a special tuning-fork, 
twelve vibrations per second may be heard as a tone, 
although the individual puffs may be heard as pulsa- 
tions in the tone up to twenty vibrations, or higher. 
This lowest tone, which may be produced only momen- 
tarily, is, of course, very deep and seems massive and 
rolling in the distance. The lower limit depends upon 
the form and force of the vibration as determined by the 
shape, position, and swing of the sounding body. Waves 
from electrical sparks, e.g., do not fuse into a tone below 
100 vibrations per second. 
The upper limit of pitch. — There is likewise an upper 
limit of tonality, set by the limits in the harp structure  
-P-A-G-E-76
  58 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
in the ear. Experiments now indicate that the upper 
limit is probably not far from 30,000 d.v. (double vibra- 
tions per second).!. This upper limit varies greatly with 
age and with individuals of the same age. Roughly, it 
may be said that, if the upper limit is 30,000 d.v. for a 
person of seventeen, it is quite probable that it will be 
reduced to 15,000 d.v. by the age of seventy. This de- 
cline results not only in the loss of high tones but also in 
radical changes in the character of low tones through the 
loss of their high overtones. This decrease with age 
seems to be quite independent of the use of the ear. It 
is undoubtedly in accord with the biological law that 
the most delicate structures are the first to suffer decline 
with increasing callousness from age. 
Pitch discrimination. — The fundamental measure of 
capacity for tonal hearing is called pitch discrimination 
and is expressed in terms of the least perceptible differ- 
ence (l.p.d.) in pitch in terms of vibrations. It may be 
measured accurately with a set of tuning-forks tuned for 
convenient differences in pitch.? This measure of pitch 
discrimination or sense of pitch becomes a sort of yard- 
stick in terms of which we measure a great variety of 
tonal features. One of the most practical applications 
lies in the measurement of individual differences for 
tonal hearing. Some persons cannot recognize the tune 
of Yankee Doodle except by the words. Some normal 
ears are not sensitive to smaller differences in pitch than 
a half-tone. Others may hear perfectly differences as 
125000 d.v. is the highest limit yet reached experimentally because it is 
difficult to get high tones sufficiently loud. 
2 Columbia phonograph record No. 7536, “The Sense of Pitch,” is serviceable 
for this measurement,

HEARING 59 
small as z$> of a tone. The latter, then, are at least 
one hundred times as keen as the former. 
Pitch discrimination as a physiological capacity does 
not vary with age, except in so far as deterioration may 
set in. The child may reach his finest use of the sense 
of pitch during the first year or two. Knowledge about 
pitch and ability to desig- 
nate it of course comes later. 
The differences we find indi- 
cated for various ages in 
practical testing are fully 
accounted for by the differ- ’ 
ence in knowledge of pitch ric. 10, — Tracing from a tuning- 
and the power of attention fork 
in application to the task. There is no significant 
variation with sex, and perhaps no great variation with 
race. 
Pitch discrimination does not vary with training. In 
this respect the ear is like the eye. No amount of train- 
ing will improve the visual acuity of the eye as an organ. 
Visual training results in learning how to use the acuity 
to the limit of the capacity of the organism. So in hear- 
ing, the harp structure in the ear is probably at its best 
early in infancy, and change in capacity is likely to be in 
the direction of deterioration. But this does not dis- 
courage ear training in education. From infancy to the 
most extreme and refined art-training in music, there is 
unlimited opportunity for development of hearing. But 
this is not improving the ear or the psychophysic capacity 
for pitch discrimination: it is merely the development 
of the meaning and skill in the use of a delicate organ. 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  60 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
Pitch discrimination does not vary with intelligence. 
A person may be the ablest mathematician or philoso- 
pher and not have the gift of a good sense of pitch; and, 
contrariwise, it is notorious that musical prodigies, as 
far as tonal hearing is concerned, have often been of low 
wit. On the other hand, pitch discrimination is a tool 
of thought. No man can image, think, feel, or control 
tonal effects which he has not heard. 
In music, the discovery of extraordinary talent and the 
direction and encouragement of talent is a problem in- 
volving not only happiness and success, but economic 
and moral problems. There are many other occupations 
‘in which life depends upon tonal hearing. Thus in the 
World War it was quite possible to select by means of 
tests of pitch discrimination from a group of ten equally 
trained cadets one who, by virtue of his fine hearing, 
could locate a submarine from two to ten times as ac- 
curately as another. And, between music and war lies 
many a fertile field. 
Timbre. — A tone is said to be pure when it is-caused 
by a simple, uniform, smooth, pendular vibration,~ as 
in Fig. 10, which is a tracing from a point of a vibrating 
tuning-fork when drawn evenly across a sensitive paper. 
Pure tones are rare in nature and are not much used in 
music, partly because they are thin and colorless, and 
partly because it is difficult to produce them. Tones 
which are not pure are rich in varying degrees. The 
various degrees and kinds of richness we call timbre.! 
We explain timbre in terms of overtones as illustrated 
1Tn common language, physics, and music, the term quality is ordinarily 
used to designate timbre, but psychologically this is incorrect, ‘as has been 
shown above.

in Fig. 11, where the form of the upper wave is deter- 
mined by, and may be analyzed into, the presence of 
overtones 2-12. When we hear, e.g., a violin tone, 
the richness is due to the fact that the string produces 
not only one tone 
but a series of 
tones that blend 
and fuse into 
one. When the 
string is bowed 
it divides itself 
into segments, 
each of which vi- 
brates by itself. 
The string vi- 
brates by halves, 
thirds, fourths,

many as thirty 
sections under

tions. Each seg- 
ment produces a

mental tone. Tonal timbre may therefore be represented

in terms of wave form as is illustrated in Fig. 12, in 
which A is a photograph of the sound wave from the

Timbre, then, covers all those tone characteristics 
which range through the practically infinite variety of 
pitch complexes in a pure tone at one extreme, through 
all the degrees of musical richness of tone, to the noise 
or toneless sound at the other. Thus one piano, one 
violin, one voice, one noise, differs from another in the 
timbre. Even the difference between vowels is prima- 
rily a matter of timbre — a difference in the number and

relative reinforcement of overtones. We shall be helped 
in our orientation in this field if we keep clearly in mind 
two concepts: first, that, psychologically, timbre is to 
be understood and explained as a complex of pitches 
fused into a single tone; and, second, that, physically, 
timbre is expressed in terms of the form of a sound 
wave. 
Noise. — We are now prepared |to understand the 
nature of noise. Noise is sound which is so irregular in 
the form of wave as to make the harshness more con- 
* spicuous than the tonality. Noises are produced through 
the same end-organs as tones. Most noises have an ele-
-P-A-G-E-81
HEARING 63 
ment of tonality; tap the pencil on a table, the floor, 
or a book and each noise will have a recognized pitch. 
Indeed, practically all the noises of nature are tonal.! 
Likewise, it is true that most of the tones of nature and 
of art, including the human voice, carry accessory noises. 
Indeed, good music seems to demand cymbals, drums, and 
kettles to supplement relatively pure and mellow tones. 
Noises are classified into simple and complex. A rap, a 
tap, a flick, a thud, are examples of simple noises of which 
there are a vast variety in nature. But all nature is 
anoise with complex sounds, such as rattle, patter, purl- 
ing, buzz, whirr, and whining. Indeed the dictionary 
contains a surprisingly large number of names for dif- 
ferent kinds of noises. 
Beats. — We have so far examined a single tone in 
its various degrees of complexity. It is only a further 
step in the same direction to explain the experience of 
simultaneous tones, as in consonance and dissonance, 
which are the elemental forms of harmony and discord. 
If we take a series of forks and sound, e.g., 435 and 436 
d.v., there will be a pronounced beat or swell in loudness 
once a second; for 435 and 437, it will be twice asecond, 
and so on, the rule being that there will be as many beats 
per second as the number of vibrations of difference per 
second. This is due to the physical principle of inter- 
ference: when the waves are in the same phase, they co- 
operate and the sound is loud; when they are in the 
1 Carlyle says: ‘See deep enough and you see musically; the heart of nature 
being everywhere music if you can only reach it.” Byron says: “There’s music in the sighing of a reed: 
There’s music in the gushing of a rill: 
There’s music in all things if men had ears.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  64 INTRODUCTION. TO PSYCHOLOGY 
opposite phase, they counteract and the sound nearly 
ceases. 
Combination tones. — When the beats cease to be 
heard as beats, they suddenly appear as a new phantom 
tone known as a difference tone. Thus c!, 256 d.v., 
and e!, 320 d.v., will be heard not only as these two 
tones or a blend, when sounded together, but there will 
be heard also a low tone corresponding to the difference 
in pitch, i.c., 64 d.v. Likewise, a summation tone is 
produced, corresponding always to a pitch denoted by 
the sum of the two vibration frequencies, as in the 
case of c! and e! above, where the first difference tone 
is 64 d.v., the summation tone is 576 d.v. These combi- 
nation tones play an important réle in richness and 
blending of chords. r 
Consonance and dissonance. — When two tones are 
sounded together, we speak of a two-clang; when the 
two tones blend and tend to agree and fuse into one tone, 
the two-clang is said to be consonant.' The opposite 
isdissonance. Between extreme consonance and extreme 
dissonance we have a gradual transition. In music we 
speak of consonances, semi-consonances, and disso- 
nances. Furthermore, there are different kinds of con- 
sonances and dissonances. In general, the octave forms 
a unit, and the various consonances and dissonances are 
repeated in all other octaves. When two or more notes 
of the same pitch are sounded together, they are heard 
as one, and this one is located in some false position ac- 
- cording to the physical law of the resultant of forces 
1 The “sense of consonance”’ may be measured with Columbia phonograph 
record No. 7439.

HEARING 65 
and is known as a phantom sound. We must not con- 
fuse consonance and dissonance with agreeableness and 
disagreeableness in music; in general we like conso- 
nance, but sometimes we may be in a mood that is agree- 
ably vented in discord, and discord is essential for many 
pleasing musical effects. 
Harmony and discord. — Thus, we have reviewed the 
conditions which determine harmony and discord of 
sounds. When two or more sounds are produced si- 
multaneously, the fusion is characterized by two features : 
(1) the richness of the fusion depends upon the timbre 
of each source, the presence of difference tones, summa- 
tion tones, and the consonance-dissonance relations of 
all tones; and (2) the unity of the experience is deter- 
mined by the fusion of all tones of the same pitch, by the 
massive blend of consonances, and by the fusion of over- 
tones with the fundamental. 
Melody. — Melody is essentially a pleasing sequence 
of tones. In many ways, the laws of consonance apply 
to melody, as in harmony. 
INTENSITY OF SOUND 
Hearing-ability, technically called acuity of hearing, 
is measured in terms of the faintest sound that can be 
heard; i.e., the threshold of hearing, by means of some 
form of audiometer. This threshold varies for ears from 
the keenest to the deaf. Acuity varies also for differ- 
ent pitches. A thorough test must, therefore, cover all 
tones within the significant range of pitch. Some per-. 
sons have tonal gaps in the form of a small range of pitch 
for which they do not hear sounds; others are limited
-P-A-G-E-84
  66 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
to a small “island” of hearing. Many so-called deaf 
have islands in which they can hear for a limited range 
of pitch. The significance of knowledge about this is 
of course patent for schools, many industrial occupa- 
tions, and for art. 
Variation in intensity plays an important rdle in hear- 
ing. All musical “ expression” rests largely on inten- 
sity; 7z.e., “hearing” loudness differences, and their 
control by hearing. Next to pitch inflection, the grace- 
ful nuances of the human speech are variations in inten- 
sity. The hearing of direction, distance, and volume 
of all sounds is largely a matter of hearing of intensity 
differences. Discrimination for intensity in terms of 
the least perceptible difference is measured by means 
of an audiometer, in which the loudness of a given tone 
or noise may be controlled and measured.’ 
A blind person may walk about the streets and guide 
himself largely by hearing. The blind as a class are no 
more sensitive to sound than seeing persons, nor are 
they necessarily keener in discrimination. The differ- 
ence lies in the fact that they have learned to use 
their auditory discrimination as a substitute for sight. 
The same is true of artists in music. They have 
learned to attach meaning to delicate shades of intensity 
differences. : 
THE SENSE OF TIME 
The motor theory. — While we perceive time more or 
less directly through the various senses, hearing is pre- 
1 To measure this, use Columbia phonograph record No. 7537, “The Sense of 
Intensity.”
-P-A-G-E-85
HEARING 67 
eminently the sense of time. We must distinguish this, 
however, from the general estimation, or the flow of 
time, as in hours, days, or years. In noting the duration 
of a single sound, we have a tendency to reproduce it 
actually, inceptively, or by mere image of action. Like- 
wise, in judging a succession of sensations of sound, we 
match the duration of intervals with the time we are 
“keeping ” subjectively. The movements need not be 
sound-producing: they may be any kind from a twitch 
of the eye to the twitch of a toe. 
Time discrimination. — “ Auditory time” is limited 
to the perception of short duration of intervals, perio- 
dicity, and time in rhythm. Like the sense of pitch, 
the sense of time is a talent. Each person has a personal 
equation expressing his natural aptitude in this respect. 
This is measured in terms of the least perceptible dif- 
ference in time.! A person of rare capacity may hear a 
variation of z5 sec., while another may not hear a 
variation of 7% sec. in a standard rate of 1 second; 
t.e., one is fifty times as keen as another and this dif- 
ference may be a relatively fixed trait. 
Subjective rhythm. 
Exercise. — Listen to the tick of a pendulum clock or metronome 
and observe the inceptive movements to mark the time. Describe 
the tendencies you observe. Now, tilt the clock so as to make it limp 
and state how you can tell that one interval is longer than the other. 
The hearing of rhythm. — The sense of rhythm is an 
instinctive disposition to group recurrent sense impres- 
sions vividly and with precision by time, or intensity, 
1To measure this, use Columbia phonograph record No. 7538, ‘The Sense of 
Time.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  68 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
or both, in such a way as to derive pleasure and effi- 
ciency through the grouping. 
Rhythm as heard may be either subjective or objec- 
tive. The objective rhythm, as we ordinarily find it in 
prose and poetry, is marked by emphasis of time, or in- 
tensity, or both. Occasionally it may be also through 
pitch, although that always involves intensity. It is 
probable that it may also come through other senses than 
hearing. Subjective rhythm is more fundamental than 
objective rhythm and always plays a large réle in the 
objective. This is the reason why we find rhythm more 
essentially a matter of personality rather than a matter 
of objective grouping. All rhythm is primarily a pro- 
jection of personality. The rhythm is what Iam. For 
him who is not endowed with this talent, the objec- 
tive workings of rhythm in nature and art are largely 
wasted. 
Subjective rhythm is the grouping of tones or time 
intervals which are absolutely uniform in time and in- 
tensity, quite as though certain of the notes were actu- 
ally accented. This is a universal tendency which may 
easily be verified. If, for example, a series of tones of 
absolute uniformity in every respect. be played, the lis- 
tener will inevitably hear time in measures ; for example, 
2 or } time, and will actually hear the appropriate notes 
accented. 
While the perception of rhythm involves the whole 
organism, it requires primarily five fundamental ca- 
pacities. The first two of these are the sense of time 
and the sense of intensity; corresponding respectively to 
the two attributes of sound which constitute the sen-
-P-A-G-E-87
  HEARING 69 
sory media of rhythm. The third and fourth are audi- 
tory imagery and motor imagery; that is, the capacity 
for reliving vividly in representation the auditory ex- 
perience and the motor attitudes respectively. The 
fifth is a motor impulse for rhythm in action, an instinc- 
tive tendency chiefly unconscious and largely organic. 
These five factors may be said to be basic to the sense 
ofrhythm. Other general factors, such as emotional type 
and temperament, logical span, or creative imagination, 
are intimately woven into the warp and woof of rhythm, 
but we shall probably find that these are secondary to 
the primary and basic forces named. 
There are two fundamental traits of rhythmic percep- 
tion; namely, vividness and precision. A person may 
have effusive rhythmic feeling in the perception of mu- 
sic and live himself into it realistically and yet not have 
any capacity for precision. Likewise, one may have fine 
capacity for precision in rhythmic perception and yet 
not have the vivid emotional experience of the rhythm. 
Between these extremes we have many types of rhythmic 
hearing, both qualitatively and quantitatively. 
Aupitory SPACE 
Hearing is a specific spatial sense for the hearing of 
direction, which is an element of the first dimension 
of space. Other aspects of spatial hearing, such as dis- 
tance, are more or less secondary or derived. Just as we 
have two eyes for the perception of distance (second 
dimension), so we have two ears for the perception of 
direction (first dimension). Bigness, or extensity, is an 
inherent attribute in the sensation of sound.
-P-A-G-E-88
  7O INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
Hearing direction. 
Exercise. — (a) Be seated, blindfolded, and have some one stand 
three feet in front and produce a sound, such as the snapping of two 
coins together, first in front and then a small distance either to the right 
or to the left, and find out how small a difference’in direction you can 
hear. A good observer will be able to hear a difference of 1° in horizon- 
tal direction. Record twenty trials. 
(6) In the same manner, produce the sound in the median plane 
and ask the observer to point in the direction of the source of sound. 
Record twenty trials. Compare the result in the two planes. 
We have three sets of mechanisms for the hearing of 
direction: (1) two ears in symmetrical position; (2) ear 
funnels; and (3) recesses and shelves in the outer ear. 
These bring about in turn the three marks of direction, 
binaural balance of intensity, monaural gradation of in- 
tensity, and characteristics of timbre, as follows: 
(r) Binaural intensity.—When the source of sound is 
directly to the right, it sounds loudest in the right ear. 
As we move it forward on the arc of a circle at the level 
of the ear, it grows gradually weaker in the right and 
stronger in the left until we reach the front, when the 
two intensities are equal. The same principle may be 
traced through the other three quadrants; likewise, 
through any circles that have the aural axis as a diameter. 
This difference in intensity is the mark of direction. 
Ordinarily we are not conscious of intensity differences. 
What we are aware of hearing is not intensity difference 
but direction.t 
1 A crucial proof of this law lies in the fact that when this principle does not 
operate we do not hear direction. The median plane, i.e., a plane through the 
head at right angles to the aural axis, is a case in point, as was demonstrated 
in Ex. b. While we have keen ability for discrimination of right and left from 
this plane, we have no capacity for hearing direction radially within that plane.
-P-A-G-E-89
HEARING 71 
(2) Monaural intensity. — But the person with one 
ear can hear direction surprisingly well, especially on 
the good ear side. This is due mainly to the intensity 
difference caused by the funnel; a sound is loudest di- 
rectly in front of the funnel. From this point it gradu- 
ally decreases through a semicircle on any radius from 
the ear to the opposite side 180° away. 
(3) Timbre. — The outer human ear is “corrugated” ; 
7.e., it has a series of shelves and recesses which break up 
the rich sounds, reinforcing certain overtones and limit- 
ing others on the principle of reflection and refraction of 
the sounds so that the sound is different according as it 
comes from one direction or another.! 
Hearing distance, relief, and volume. — Distance we 
hear inadequately chiefly in terms of intensity. Hear- 
ing gives us no adequate perception of form or relief, as 
perceived through secondary criteria. Volume may be 
of different kinds. Thus we have extensity-volume, 
which varies with pitch and extensity of tone, as may be 
observed in the comparison of high tones with low tones ; 
intensity-volume, depending entirely on the amplitude of 
the sound wave; timbre-volume, in which the volume 
varies with the richness of the tone; and reduplication 
volume, as when two or more sounds are heard together. 
Sounds within that plane may seem to come from any direction within the plane. 
We cannot distinguish front from back or up from down. This is because the 
intensity is the same for the two ears for all points within that plane. It is 
interesting to find that we have a distinct illusion to the effect that we hear di- 
rection in this plane and feel considerable confidence in our judgment. 
1 Nature has adopted two types of ear: the movable form as found in the 
mule and the rabbit, and the stationary timbre-analyzing ear, as in man. In- 
stead of the human ear being a dwarfing of a long ear, as many books say, it is 
a different kind of ear and is better.

  CHAPTER VI 
TASTE AND SMELL 
Taste! 
Taste is the guardian of the digestive system. Our 
preliminary sorting of what is fit or unfit, agreeable or 
disagreeable, for the system is ordinarily done by sight, 
pressure, smell, and temperature; but taste is the final 
court of appeal. This censorship is, however, only the 
restrictive or negative aspect of the function of taste. 
Its positive, aggressive, and most fundamental function 
in the biological economy lies in its stimulating effect. 
This takes two forms: (1) automatic control of the 
processes of secretion, which is essential to digestion ; 
and (2) a source of pleasure — perhaps the most uni- 
versal source of pleasure in animal life — the foundation 
of the will to live.” 
1 “Developing as one of the earliest forms of sensitiveness, intimately as- 
sociated with the vital processes of life and growth, affording manifold richness 
of pleasure and aversion, full of paradoxical surprises and puzzling problems, 
and figuratively expressing one of the rarest of human qualities, ‘the sense of 
taste,’ constitutes one of man’s most interesting contacts with the outer world.” 
(Hollingworth and Poffenberger) 
2Taste and digestion. — Interesting experiments by surgical and physio- 
logical methods have demonstrated the truth of the adage, “Good digestion 
waits on appetite.” Agreeable taste initiates the secretion of the gastric juices 
so that the stomach shall be prepared to perform its chemical processes when 
the food arrives: indifferent tastes do not effectively release these secretions ; 
offensive tastes may set up negative or defensive reactions. The secretion 
varies with the palatability of the food. The special appeal to taste by the 
dessert is a device to stimulate the gastric secretions to a final spurt. As the 
eye so effectively directs the adjustment of our muscles in walking, so the 
sense of taste gives initial direction to the whole series of the digestive processes.

  TASTE AND. SMELL 43 
The qualities of taste. — How many tastes have we, 
and what are they? When we think of the vast, almost 
chaotic, varieties of taste experiences, this question seems 
difficult to answer; but the reply is quite simple: we 
have four tastes — four and only four — sweet, sour, 
salt, and bitter. With these four qualities we can ac- 
count for all kinds of taste experiences and explain them 
fully in terms of the following variables: (1) variation 
of each of the four tastes by itself in intensity, duration, 
and extensity; (2) variation in the combination of the 
four tastes in all possible proportions of quality, in- 
tensity, duration, and space; (3) variation in the com- 
bination of all these varieties in combination with other 
senses; and (4) the combination of those effective ex- 
periences which are commonly regarded as taste, but 
are not taste at all. The first of these two sets of va- 
rieties are self-explanatory; the third and fourth de- 
serve further account. 
Taste fusions. — It has been said that before we at- 
tempt to explain anything we must attempt to explain 
it away. The problem of taste blends or fusions is a 
good case in point. Let us consider some concrete ex- 
amples. 
Case I.—If we take coffee, tea, and quinine and 
reduce them to the same temperature and the same 
strength, and draw off the grounds, then blindfold the 
The joy of eating. — As the eye feasts on color, and the ear on tone, so the 
mouth feasts on taste. The biological significance of this lies not primarily in 
the fact that “flavor” is the plastic medium of the most universal art — the art 
of feeding — but the fact that as color in nature enriches the world without, so 
savor in the mouth is the most sentient source of the consciousness of the wealth 
and power of the organism within. In other words, the function of being a 
guardian and a regulator of digestion is of a rather menial order as compared 
with that of being the herald of well-being.

observer, plug his nostrils, and with a teaspoon give 
him a series of drinks out of each cup and require him to 
name what he is drinking, he will be unable to do so, 
because under these conditions coffee, tea, and quinine 
taste alike. They all taste bitter—the same kind of 
bitter, and nothing but bitter. No one can distinguish 
them by the quality of taste alone. The best dis- 
tinguishing mark of coffee and tea is odor; color helps. 
But quinine has no odor. As quinine is usually taken its 
distinguishing mark is the intensity of taste. Eliminate 
odor, color, pressure, and temperature, and keep the 
three attributes of intensity, duration, and space constant, 
and these three substances taste alike.’ It is necessary 
to proceed slowly and rinse the mouth frequently with 
distilled water. The conditions must be such that the 
observer has no sense but taste to judge by, and the 
tastes are reduced to the same strength. 
Case II. —If we take some pure vinegar and some 
pure dry (sour) wine, dilute the vinegar to the same 
strength of sour as the wine, eliminate other senses 
by taking the same precautions in limiting the sensation 
to taste as before, and serve the observer a teaspoonful 
at a time of each liquid for a number of times, and re- 
quire him to say in each case whether he drank wine 
or vinegar, under these conditions, wine and vinegar will 
taste exactly alike: he will not be able to distinguish 
1In the original experiment as performed by Patrick, one of the observers 
was anosmic, completely devoid of the sense of smell. Normal observers find 
some difficulty in eliminating smell by means of plugging the nostrils. 
2 The wag may query, “If odor is the common source of pleasure in coffee and 
tea, why not just sit down and smell the coffee and tea?” Or, “If you want to 
taste a hot liquid, why not drink a cup of a solution of quinine?” The answer 
is clear: we enjoy coffee and tea through several senses, and the basic motive for 
drinking them is the stimulating after-effect, which is quite independent of taste.

them. The “bouquet” or flavor of the wine is its. odor. 
The merit of vinegar is its strength and purity. Dry 
wine and vinegar have the same taste — sour, and when 
pure, nothing but sour. 
Case III.—If we take honey, various kinds of 
syrup, sugar, and molasses, reduce them to the same 
degree of sweetness, eliminate all other senses except 
taste and serve as. before, the observer will not be able 
to distinguish any of these by taste. They all taste 
the same — sweet, and when pure, nothing but sweet. 
The relish of one more than another is in terms of sensa- 
tion of color and complicated associations and instinctive 
tendencies. 
Case IV.—If we take all obtainable samples of 
fresh meat, — beef, mutton, pork (fibrous), turkey, 
chicken, quail, duck, etc.; boil each of them without 
seasoning, reduce to a fine pulp, eliminate other senses 
than taste, and serve them with appropriate precaution, 
all these meats (fresh) will taste alike. They have a 
delicate taste of sweetness, and that alone. Noone can 
tell pork from turkey or venison from quail, by taste. 
1 The “taste” of meats as we know them resolves itself to a muscular strain, 
odor, color, and form, with a sweet taste, and, most of all, the taste of the season- 
ing and accessories in serving. The experimenter, when asked “Why is turkey 
preferred to chicken?” replied, “Because there is more of it.” ‘Why, then, is 
quail better than chicken?” ‘Because there is less of it.’ This paradox 
should help us in our analysis of the perception of taste. The taste of turkey is 
exactly the same as the taste of chicken. But the trouble is that the chicken 
does not have a fair chance. We serve turkey when we are to have guests or on 
holidays to celebrate. We dress up, take leisure, invite our best friends, deco- 
rate with flowers, use our best table service, and accompany the eating with 
music. And in preparation for all this, the cook has taxed her culinary art to 
prepare the most delicate dressing, to “perfection” to roast, and garnish, and 
finally to have it carried in in state, the center of the feast, playing upon all the 
senses, imagination, and feeling. Our mouths water and the turkey tastes good. 
All this is unfair to the chicken. 
Take the other paradox; Why is quail preferred to chicken? “Because 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
76 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
Countless experiments similar to these four might be 
arranged to aid in the analysis. The point is clear that 
what we ordinarily think of as taste often is admixtures 
from other senses or is dominated by. associations or 
feelings. What we shall taste is not a matter of sensa- 
tion but a rich setting in instinctive responses and their 
fixed associations. 
The sense organs of taste.— The taste buds or 
flasks (Appendix, Fig. 35) lie in little nodules, folds, or 
ridges, called papillae in the surface of the tongue and 
adjacent areas of the mouth. These flasks contain the 
taste cells, each of which has a hairlike projection in 
the neck of the flask serving as a wick. The nerve of 
taste branches around these cells. The saliva aids in 
depositing a solution from the tastable substances. 
The movement of the tongue acts as a churning process, 
and forces the solution through the pores. The chemical 
action in the taste cells sets up a nervous impulse which 
is carried to the brain. To what extent these taste 
there is less of it.” Suppose that father has been trudging through the thick 
underbrush for many hours and finally comes home to his family of eight with one 
lone quail in his bag. The taste of that bird will be heightened in proportion to 
its littleness, in comparison with the labor it has cost; also by the knowledge 
that it is rare. With this also comes an instinctive appreciation for hunting 
game in the wild. Chicken is tame. 
1 Taste of an anosmic. — One of the observers in the original experiment 
by Patrick was anosmic; i.e., she was completely devoid of the sense of smell. 
The theory of the experiment was that those substances which normal observers 
can, but the anosmic cannot, recognize when blindfolded are recognizable pri- 
marily by their odor, and not by their taste. Among these are tincture of 
vanilla, vanilla extract, spirits of almond, pineapple syrup, orange, lemon, 
banana, grape, quince, strawberry, fig, tea, cocoa, chocolate, milk, sour milk, 
vinegar, claret, oil of rose, rhubarb, onion, boiled turnip, navy beans (liquid 
form), liquor of raw oysters, yolk of egg, white of egg, kerosene, peach syrup, 
currant jelly, wintergreen, port wine, sherry wine, brandy, unsalted butter, 
cream, olive oil, vaseline, cabbage, pumpkin, raw potato, beef broth, mutton, 
and mutton broth. A similar list could be made for each of the other taste- 
supporting senses.

cells are specialized for the respective tastes we do not 
know. The tip of the tongue is primarily sensitive to 
sweetness, the top near the root to bitter, the sides to 
sour, and the larger part of the surface to salt. Two or 
more tastes may be obtained from the same papilla. 
Combinations of taste. — Taste qualities do not mix 
to form intermediate tastes as do colors and _ tones. 
They behave like four independent series. Indeed, 
some think sweet is as different from sour as “aioe, 
cold. We cannot pass gradually from one taste into 
another. Yet the effect of one taste upon another is a 
matter of common observation. The edge of one taste 
may be taken off (compensation or neutralization) by 
another, as acid by sugar in lemonade. On account of 
the, apparent mixture, it often becomes difficult to say 
whether a certain combination is sweet or bitter though 
clearly tastable. Under certain conditions tastes con- 
trast with one another. But of this we know very little. 
It is probable that many of the effects are associational 
rather than sensory. 
Individual differences. — From the point of view of 
intensity of sensations, we have the two problems of 
sensitivity and discrimination as in other senses. These 
may be measured by using appropriate solutions of salt, 
acid, sugar, and quinine. There are very great individ- 
ual differences both in sensitivity and discrimination, 
from that of the most delicate response to taste dif- 
ferences in the connoisseur, to ageusia, the loss of the 
sense of taste for one or more of the four qualities. 
Lag and latent time. — From the point of view of 
duration of taste, we are interested in two classes of  
-P-A-G-E-96
  78 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
phenomena: (1) lag and latent time, and (2) adaptation 
and fatigue. Taste is the slowest of all the senses. It 
has to await chemical analysis. The time that elapses 
between the beginning of the stimulation and the be- 
ginning of the sensation is ‘called latent time. This 
is three times as long for bitter as for salt, as is shown 
in the typical reaction-time to taste: salt, .30 sec., sour, 
+55 sec., and bitter, 1.20 sec. Likewise, taste persists 
longer than other senses, partly on account of the linger- 
ing of the stimulus. This persistence is called the lag 
of the sensation. 
Adaptation, fatigue, and habituation. — Like the ear, 
the eye, and the nostril, the tongue does not adapt it- 
self to the stimulus to a marked degree. As a physio- 
logical organism it is strong and stable. It does, how- 
ever, like all the other senses, respond to habituation and 
organic adaptation to use. The strong and unpleasant 
may become mild and agreeable, as in habituation to 
tobacco and drinks; the moderate and agreeable may 
become strong and disagreeable. These adaptations 
are undoubtedly based upon aggressive or defensive 
organizations in the physiological mechanism. 
Location of taste. — Is taste a space sense? On ac- 
count of our manifold of equipment for space perception, 
and on account of the limited spatial area for taste we 
may say that taste is not used extensively as a space 
sense. However, if we take a solution of sugar and 
another of pure water, and apply to the tongue a drop 
of each simultaneously in two places on the tongue so 
that the only difference is location and taste, we will have 
no difficulty in saying which drop was sweet. Taste has

the same peripheral facilities for space registration in 
the mouth as touch has. While its sphere is limited, 
taste may undoubtedly function in giving position and 
area of tastable substances in the mouth. 
SMELL 
Smell,! “taste at a distance,’’ is the guardian of res- 
piration. The original chemical sense perhaps serves 
both the purposes of taste and smell. The purposes of 
smell are clearly analogous to those of taste. It gives 
protection and makes foods and drinks palatable, and 
reaches out to make the perfume of nature and art play 
upon our organism with enriching effect. One of its 
most fundamental biological functions is the attraction 
of sex. 
Exercise. — List all the names of odors that you can. 
1“For some inexplicable reason the sense of smell does not hold the high 
position it deserves among its sisters. There is something of the fallen angel 
about it. When it woos us with woodland scents and beguiles us with the fra- 
grance of lovely gardens, it is admitted frankly to our discourse. But when 
it gives us warning of something noxious in our vicinity, it is treated as if the 
demon had got the upper hand of the angel, and is relegated to outer darkness, 
punished for its faithful service. . . . In my experience smell is most im- 
portant. . . . I doubt if there is any sensation arising from sight more de- 
lightful than the odors which filter through sun-warmed, wind-tossed branches, 
or the tide of scents which swells, subsides, rises again wave on wave, filling the 
wide world with invisible sweetness. A whiff of the universe makes us dream of 
worlds we have never seen, recalls in a flash entire epochs of our dearest ex- 
perience. . . . The sense of smell has told me of a coming storm hours be- 
fore there was any sign of it visible. . . . I know by smell the kind of house we 
enter. . . . In the evening quiet there are fewer vibrations than in the day- 
time, and then I rely more largely upon smell. . . . Smell gives me more 
idea than touch or taste of the manner in which sight and hearing probably dis- 
charge their functions. . . . From exhalations I learn much about people. 
I know often the work they are engaged in. The odors of wood, iron, paint, and 
drugs cling to the garments of those that work in them. ... I have not, 
indeed, the ‘all-knowing scent of the hound or the wild animal. . . . Never- 
theless, human odors are as varied and capable of recognition as hands and 
faces. The dear odors of those I love are so definite, so unmistakable, that noth- 
ing can quite obliterate them.” (Helen Keller)
-P-A-G-E-98
  80 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
The qualities of odors. — Smell is the only sense for 
which the qualities have not been isolated.1_ The mani- 
fold of smell is perhaps greater than that of taste. But 
we do not know whether the odor qualities lie in one 
series as in tones, in two as in sight, in four as in taste, 
or even more. This is the reason we do not know any 
names for odors. The list called for above may contain 
names like these: aromatic, fragrant, nauseating, pierc- 
ing ; faded rose-leaves, beefsteak, cheese ; sweet, pungent ; 
agreeable, unpleasant. None of these are the names 
of odors. Aromatic means essentially that it smells, 
and is, therefore, usually attributed to spices; beef- 
steak is the name of one of the countless objects of smell ; 
sweet is a taste; pungent refers to pressure and pain; 
agreeable is a general term referring to feeling;? it 
seems probable that we shall be able to reduce olfactory 
qualities to a small number, possibly four or six. Many 
methods have been employed, all very arduous and not 
entirely successful, for the solving of this problem. 
Perhaps the best method, after we have a clue or theory, 
is the method of fatigue.’ 
1 Henning (der Geruch, Leipsic, 1916) has proposed a classification on the 
basis of the chemical constituents of odoriferous substances and has repre- sented odors on a prism with such arbitrary names as fragrant, ethereal, and 
putrid to designate the respective corners of one end, and spicy, resinous, and 
burned odors the corners at the other end of the prism. He indicates the rela- 
tionship of all other odors by points on the intervening planes. If this theory 
were true, it would mark a great step in advance; but unfortunately it has not 
yet been satisfactorily developed and verified. 
2Tt is astonishing how we have floundered in pharmacology, botany, and lit- 
erary description for want of names with which to designate specific odors. 
3 The theory of specific energy maintains that each sense quality has its own 
specific end-organs. If in any way we can interfere with one specific set of 
end-organs, this should result in the loss of sensibility to all the odors that come through that organ and should not interfere with other organs. It so 
happens that the sense of smell fatigues quickly. If, for instance, we take
-P-A-G-E-99
  
  TASTE AND SMELL 81 
End-organs of smell. — The olfactory cells which are 
the end-organs of smell lie imbeddéd in the lining of the 
mucous membrane of the upper chambers of the nose 
(Appendix, Fig. 36). The stimulus must be in the form 
of gas or vapor. Even if we fill the nose with the most 
odorific liquid, we cannot smell it. The organ of smell 
is, in many orders of the lower animals, the most highly 
developed part of the nervous system. The olfactory 
lobe is in some animals as large as the hemispheres, which 
indicates the relative dominance of the sense of smell 
in these lower orders. 
Complementary odors, antagonism, and compensa- 
tion. — Smell, being a chemical sense, behaves like color, 
which is also a chemical sense. The phenomena of an- 
tagonism, mixture, and contrast are analogous in the 
two senses, though less stable and less organized in smell. 
When we mixed complementary colors, we found that 
they neutralized each other. This law of complemen- 
taries holds also for odors, properly chosen; but since 
we do not know the olfactory qualities, we cannot have 
any adequate classification of complementaries. The 
best that we can do is to name some substances. The 
following pairs are complementary: musk and oil of 
bitter almonds; caoutchouc and paraffin; ammonia 
and acetic acid; volatile oils and iodoform. Being 
ammonium sulphide, which has a’ strong odor, and smell it for a minute or two, 
the sense-organ will be fatigued and the smell of the ammonium is lost. If we 
then immediately try other substances, we find that under these circumstances 
we can smell, e.g., oilof anise and oil of turpentine, but cannot smell sulphureted 
hydrogen, hydrochloric acid, or bromine. The conclusion is that ammonium 
sulphide, sulphureted hydrogen, hydrochloric acid, and bromine are sensed 
through the same specific end-organ, and probably belong to the same quality 
series. While this procedure is satisfactory as far as it goes, it will take many 
generations of workers to make an adequate survey.

82 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
complementary, they are antagonistic and one may be 
used to destroy the other. This principle of compensa- 
tion is employed in many arts. Florists, who must fol- 
low certain color schemes in decoration, are able to do 
so by the fact that they are able to subdue obtruding 
odors on this principle of compensation, 
Mixture aca eerie SSRs ae ee two adjacent, 
i.e, non-complementary colors, red and yellow, we ob- 
tain an intermediate color, orange. The same prin- 
ciple applies in odor. This is, of course, one of the fun- 
damental principles of the perfumer’s art. Odors may 
be built up synthetically. Thus, musk and opium, io- 
dine and camphor, valerianic acid and hyacinth result 
in true mixtures. 
It seems possible that the law of contrast also operates, 
so that one odor enhances another; but it seems prob- 
able that the contrasts which are most prominent in 
our olfactory experiences are largely of the associational 
type. 
Intensity. — Individuals differ in their capacity for 
smell both in sensitivity and in discrimination, and in 
this we find the explanation of many of the idiosyn- 
cracies and fascinations which may develop as personal 
tastes. Sensitivity and discrimination may be measured 
by means of an olfactometer, which is a device for con- 
trolling the amount of the odoriferous substances that 
enters the nostrils. 
Adaptation and fatigue. 
Exercise. — Hold a piece of camphor, or any other strong odorifer- 
ous substance, close to the nostril for a minute or two and observe that 
at the end of that time you will not smell it at all. Record experience.
-P-A-G-E-101
  TASTE AND SMELL 83 
As we have seen, the end-organs of smell fatigue very 
quickly. This law of adaptation is a beneficent device 
to relieve us from the consciousness of odor in the en- 
vironment after the odor has delivered its message. It 
is like the alarm clock stopping after we have been 
awakened. Tanneries, gas plants, garbage wagons, 
chemical laboratories give no disturbance to those who 
stay by them. Likewise, the most gorgeous play of 
odors from nature—even more gorgeous in display 
than the colors of nature —do not glare at us contin- 
ually. Beautiful blends wafted in the woodland air 
are sensed for a short time, but gradually submerge in 
the interest of the placid life.

  CHAPTER VII 
CUTANEOUS, MOTOR, AND STATIC SENSES 
Pressure, pain, and temperature spots in the skin. 
Exercise. — With the point of a slightly dulled pin touch the 
skin on your wrist lightly in a number of places and observe that you 
feel distinct sensations of pain, cold, and pressure at different points, 
and that there are interlying areas which are insensitive to one or 
more of these sensibilities. Learn to distinguish these three kinds of 
sensation critically and to locate the sensitive points for each with 
minute accuracy. 
Now, mark off an area 10 mm. square on the back of the hand with 
a light ink line, and divide it into sixteen squares by drawing light 
cross lines. Make three similar plats in your notebook and label 
them Pressure, Pain, and Cold respectively. 
Then survey each small square in detail with a pin point and map 
in the charts the location of sensitive spots for the three respective 
sense qualities. 
All forms of cutaneous sensibility may be located in 
points, spots, or areas. These locations are usually 
different for each of the three cutaneous senses, and 
between them lie areas of insensibility. 
PRESSURE | 
Pressure as a quality.— Such terms as touch and 
feeling are too loose for scientific use. When we use 
the term touch in psychology, it should be understood 
1“Tt is not for me to say whether we see best with the hand or the eye. I 
only know that the world I see with my fingers is alive, ruddy, and satisfying. Touch brings the blind many sweet certainties which our more fortunate fellows 
miss, because their sense of touch is uncultivated. ... There is nothing 
misty or uncertain about what we can touch. Through the sense of touch I

that it is used in the narrower sense as synonymous with 
pressure. The quality of the sense of touch is pressure 
and we have only that one quality. The vast variety 
of tactual experience may be accounted for in terms of 
(z) intensity, duration, and extensity of pressure; (2) a 
blend of pressure with other sensations, such as pain, 
strain, and temperature, and (3) association of pres- 
sure with reflexes, feelings, and other non-sensory ex- 
perience. 
Examples of the first class are variations of pressure 
with intensity — contact in all degrees of pressure; 
duration — all degrees of duration; extensity — point 
contact and all variations in tactual space relations; 
intensity and extensity — roughness and smoothness ; 
duration and extensity— motion. Examples of the 
second class are variations of the sense of pressure in 
all its varieties with strain — hardness, softness, sticki- 
ness; with pain — sharpness, bluntness, prick, scratch ; 
with temperature — clamminess, wetness.1 Examples 
of the third class are itching, tingling, tickling.” 
The organs of pressure. — The organs of pressure are 
of three kinds, of which the fundamental types are the 
spring, the spindle, and the ball. (See Appendix, Fig. 
37.) In these the end-organ is protected and the pres- 
know the faces of friends, the illimitable variety of straight and curved lines, all 
surfaces, the exuberance of the soil, the delicate shapes of flowers, the noble 
forms of trees, and the range of mighty winds. Besides objects, surfaces, and 
atmospherical changes, I perceive countless vibrations. I derive much knowl- 
edge of every-day matter from the jars and jolts which are to be felt everywhere 
in the house.” (Helen Keller) 
1 The perception of wetness may be elicited without liquid; e.g., by flour, 
wood, or metal, properly adjusted for relative temperatures and pressures. 
2 Tickling is produced by intermittent light pressures. To tickle scientifi- 
cally, attach a bristle to the end of a prong of a large tuning-fork and let the 
bristle vibrate against the skin,

sure is modulated to make the response to the sense 
organ delicate. Thus, in the spring type, the Pacinian 
corpuscle, the nerve ending runs in a cross-section 
through the layers of springs in the onion-like struc- 
ture; in the spindle type, the nerve ending is so wound 
around the spindle that pressure on the spindle stretches 
the nerve; in the ball type, the nerve ending lies in a 
pile under the ball. All are mechanical contrivances 
for adapting the coarse external pressures to the delicate 
nerve endings. Pressure organs are found in all the 
linings of the body both external and internal. The 
skin is sensitive only in spots, as was demonstrated in 
the exercise. These spots are the locations of the end- 
organs. Density of the distribution varies with the im- 
portance of the sense for a given surface. Considerable 
areas, e.g., on the back, are but sparsely supplied with 
end-organs of pressure, and are, therefore, correspond- 
ingly insensitive to touch. 
In pressure, as in the other senses, the principle of 
adaptation is one of our blessings. Put a nickel in the 
palm of the hand and hold the hand perfectly still for 
two minutes; at the end of that time you will not feel 
the weight of the nickel. It is this principle of adapta- 
tion which enables us to wear hat, coat, and shoes, and to 
stand on our feet and to lie in bed, all the time pressing 
on an area of the skin without feeling discomfort. 
Pressure gives its signal and then withdraws into modest 
unobtrusiveness. 
Sensitivity and discrimination. 
Exercise. — Take a hair one inch long from your own head 
and lay it on a mirror. Lay sheets of smooth writing paper over it
-P-A-G-E-105
    
CUTANEOUS, MOTOR, AND STATIC SENSES 87 
and find through how many sheets you can locate the hair correctly 
with the finger tip. Record results. 
A good observer can locate a hair through 30 to 50 
sheets of twenty-pound bond paper. The surprising 
keenness shown in the above exercise is very suggestive 
of our unusual resources. Most of us have a very in- 
adequate conception of our reserve resources. Like 
smell, touch has remarkable capacity in reserve. The 
blind furnish a good example. Measurements show 
that the blind who are able to read raised print with 
their finger tips almost as fast as we read with our eyes 
are on the average no more sensitive to touch than we 
seeing people are. But they have learned to use the 
tactile sensations by couching meaning in them. The 
development of this power has not increased their sen- 
sitiveness to touch. It has given them the power to 
use effectively the degree of tactile sensitivity that see- 
ing persons possess but have no occasion to use to such 
an extent. 
Sensitivity for pressure may be further measured by 
an esthesiometer which has a graduated spring with 
a point r mm. in diameter for contact. Discrimination 
for intensity may be measured in terms of the least per- 
ceptible difference in pressure with the same instrument. 
Both sensitivity and discrimination vary for different 
parts of the body in accordance with biological needs 
and show wide variability for different individuals. 
Tactile space. — Pressure is perhaps the taproot of 
the spatial senses and the point of ultimate orientation 
for each of the other senses. When we are in doubt 
we say, ‘‘ Let me feel it.”” Our first measure of “ tactile 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
88 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
space” is in terms of perception of separateness. If 
the two points of a pair of dividers are set down upon 
the skin very close together, they will be felt as one. 
To be felt as two they must be separated a certain dis- 
tance which we call the two-point discrimination thresh- 
old. A list of representative threshold values for 
various parts of the body in longitudinal direction is 
shown in the following table:

TEMPERATURE 
The qualities of temperature. — The sense of tem- 
perature is the guardian of the body against injuries 
from heat and cold; but it is also an indicator of body 
condition, and, therefore, serves as a source of pleasure 
and pain within normal limits. There are two qualities, 
cold and warmth, each probably evoked by a specific 
sense organ. The sensation of heat is probably produced 
by the simultaneous stimulation of the cold and the warm 
spots, or by excessive stimulation of either. It is often 
accompanied by pain. We, therefore, regard heat as 
a complex and not an original sense quality. In pass- 
ing from warm to cold by gradual change in temperature 
we pass through a zero point which is neutral. This
-P-A-G-E-107
  
CUTANEOUS, MOTOR, AND STATIC SENSES 89 
is the normal temperature of the body, about 37°C., 
which, of course, varies from time to time in different 
areas of the surface. Temperature may be excited by 
stimulation from within or from without. From within 
we can generate heat by exercise, fever, or any other 
activity by some part of the organism. From without 
the adequate stimulus is radiant energy. There is no 
general agreement as to which of the end-organs in the 
skin are the end-organs of temperature. 
As was shown in the exercise, the skin is not sensitive 
to cold except in spots and these spots can be stimulated 
with an object at a neutral temperature, such as a pin. 
The same is true of the warmth-spots or areas, but these 
are not so readily observed with a neutral stimulus. 
We speak of warm areas and cold areas rather than 
spots because the skin is a conductor and the stimulus 
spreads over a considerable area. In mapping the tem- 
perature areas we use a little point which may be sup- 
plied with circulating warm water or cold water at a 
constant temperature. Physiological contrasts are 
effective in temperature, and adaptation is very con- 
spicuous, as in quick adjustment to changes in dress and 
climate. 
Pan 
Exercise. — Make a list of as many kinds of pain as you can 
think of, arranged in so far as possible in some kind of logical group- 
ing. 
Sensation vs. feeling. — The fact that we have sen- 
sations of pain is a modern discovery. In literature and 
good language the sensations of pain have been con- 
fused with touch as a sensation and with feeling on the 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  go INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
side of emotion. Pain is a special sense, as distinct from 
pressure’ as pressure is from cold. The sense of pain 
differs from the feeling of pain in that it is an elemental 
experience, that it has specific sense organs, and that it 
is objectively localized. 
Purposes of pain. — The sense of pain is our most 
faithful and ever present guardian, — one of our great- 
est blessings: We should be in greater danger from the 
loss of the sense of pain than from the loss of the sense 
of sight or hearing. Pain is the common warning of the 
onset of disease. On account of its persistence, many 
diseases are erroneously thought of as essentially pain, 
as in toothache or the various abdominal aches. Al- 
though pain is primarily a preventive mechanism, it 
also serves as a source of pleasure. 
The qualities of pain. — While contemporary experi- 
mental work has pointed to the existence of different 
qualities of pain, it seems probable that there is but one 
pain. We shall then be able to account for all the 
thousands of varieties of pains and aches which we de- 
scribe as cutting, piercing, pricking, gnawing, burning, 
pinching, smarting, boring, shooting, gripping, stabbing, 
grinding, sharp, dull, lightning, tearing, creeping, throb- 
bing, etc., in terms of our scheme of attributes and blends 
as in the case of pressure. Thus all known aspects of 
the pain experience may be accounted for in terms of 
the variation of the one quality, pain, (1) in all possible 
combinations of intensity, duration, and extensity of 
pain itself; (2) all possible blends of pain with other 
sense qualities, such as pressure, strain, and temperature ; 
and (3) in all perceptual associations of pain with the
-P-A-G-E-109
  
CUTANEOUS, MOTOR, AND STATIC SENSES gr 
higher mental processes, especially imagination, emotion, 
and action. 
End-organs of pain.— The free nerve endings so 
abundant, especially in all the linings of the body, are 
probably the end-organs of pain. Pain in the eye or 
ear, for example, does not come from stimulation of 
these senses but from the stimulation of the end-organs 
of pain with which these special sense organs are sup- 
plied. It is, therefore, not true, as has often been held, 
that pain may come from excessive stimulation of any 
sense organ. Many parts of the body, such as the 
brain, have no pain end-organ and are, therefore, not 
sensitive to pain. 
Illusions of location. — Pain is a space sense as is 
shown by the fact that pain points which give no other 
sensation than pain may be localized quite as accurately 
as pressure points ; and the same is true of a real stimula- 
tion. But pain is notoriously subject to normal illu- 
sions of location. Thus, we have referred, projected, de- 
flected, associated, and transferred sensations, for all 
of which the medical books have elaborate charts. 
Knowledge of these laws. of illusion in the location of 
pains is of great importance in diagnosis of disease, as 
diagnosis is done more in terms of the location of pain 
than in terms of any other sign of internal condition. Fig. 
13 shows some of the typical locations of illusory pains. 
1 After the brain is once exposed, incisions into the brain tissue may be 
made freely without causing sensations of pain. Biologically it is very sig- 
nificant that pain may be aroused by any kind of stimulations — mechanical, 
chemical, electrical, or thermal. These serve as a sort of universal guard. 
The pain spots vary in density in proportion to the delicacy of the structure 
that has to be protected. The surface of the eyeball is well protected. Large 
areas of the back have no pain spots. Individuals vary much in their supply 
of nerve endings and in their sensitivity to pain.

  Q2 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
A pain is said to be referred when it is felt as coming 
from a certain point of the body and is due, not to in- 
itiation in that part, but to irradiation somewhere along 
the nerve trunk leading from the sensed part of the body.

Fic. 13. — The locations of referred pains and their causes (from 
Herrick after Dana and Starr) 
As all the body nerves pass through the spinal cord; in- 
juries to the spinal cord and other large nerve trunks 
may cause sensations in any part of the body, depending 
upon what connection has been disturbed; i.e., the
-P-A-G-E-111
CUTANEOUS, MOTOR, AND STATIC SENSES 93 
pain is referred to the peripheral ending of the nerve 
no matter where the stimulus occurs in the course of the 
nerve. A pain is said to be projected when it is felt in a 
point which is insensitive, as in locomotor ataxia, or in 
the feeling of pain in an amputated limb. Many people 
whose limbs are buried feel pain in them. This is 
clearly related to referred pain, being due to stimulation 
of the nerve trunk. A pain is said to be deflected when 
the nerve impulse is switched to some other path in 
transit under pathological conditions. We can easily 
see how important the charts of these and many other 
types of normal illusion in the location of pain are for 
the diagnosis by the physician and how suffering human- 
ity is fooled as to the seats of trouble. 
Subjective pain: hallucinations and illusions. — 
Many of the so-called functional diseases, sometimes 
most distressing, are due to pressure, inflammation, 
and other forms of irritation along nerve paths and not 
to actual injury to tissue in the point felt. Would it 
not be a relief to the countless sufferers of this type to 
have scientific knowledge of that fact? Many of the 
most insistent and painful diseases are like the prover- 
bial black lie, made out of whole cloth — hallucinations. 
But this does not lessen their severity. The psychol- 
ogy of pain is an important chapter not only in medical 
diagnosis but also in the treatment of diseases. 
Anesthesia and hyperesthesia. — Anesthesia, as in 
the taking of ether or chloroform, is a loss of sensation 
due to the effect on the brain and the lowering of con- 
sciousness, and may affect one or more than one sense 
quality. Pain is usually the first to be lost. When

the anesthesia is for pain only, it is called analgesia. 
This may be central, as in the case of a brain lesion, or 
the pressure of great fear or joy, or the exaltation which 
comes from the feeling of power ; or it may be peripheral, 
as in local anesthesia. Hyperesthesia is excessive sen- 
sitiveness in any sense. If limited to pain, it is called 
hyperalgesia. 
Pleasure.— Many distinguished authorities main- 
tain that pleasure is a sense complementary to pain. 
This we deny because there is no special end-organ for 
pleasure and the experience of pleasure is not elemental, 
but can be reduced to constituent factors. Pleasure 
or pleasantness is analogous to unpleasantness. If 
it were not for the weakness of the word, we should use 
the term pleasantness consistently in the place of pleas- 
ure in psychological terminology. As described else- 
where, we find that pleasantness and unpleasantness, 
agreeableness and disagreeableness are affective ac- 
companiments not only of sensation but of all mental 
processes. To say that we have no special sense of 
pleasure, therefore, does not reduce our recognition of 
the ever-presence of pleasure in sensory experience. 
But pleasure is not a special sense nor an attribute of 
sensation. 
Strain. 
Exercise. — Eyes closed. (1) Point straight forward and then 
swing the arm 30° to the right. Record what sensations reported 
the movement. (2) Hold arm out in any direction. Record what 
sensations of position you observe. (3) Press finger hard on table. 
Record what sensations report resistance. (4) Lift book and estimate 
its weight. Record what sensations report weight.

CUTANEOUS, MOTOR, AND STATIC SENSES 95 
The motor senses are now frequently called kines- 
thetic, meaning energy-sensing. They are also spoken 
of as the sixth sense and as the muscle sense. They 
have always been confused with “ touch” and “ feeling” 
and often with “effort.” The end-organs of the sense 
of strain are found in the muscles, joints, and tendons. 
We accordingly speak appropriately of the muscle sense, 
the tendon sense, and the joint sense. These end-organs 
are like the end-organs of pressure and work on the same 
principle as in pressure. Indeed it is difficult to dis- 
tinguish the resulting sensation from pressure. Perhaps 
the best figurative way of expressing the difference is to 
say that the sensation of pressure represents a push and 
the sensation of strain a pull. They all have the com- 
mon quality of strain and only one quality. As in 
related sensations, we may account for all the complex 
experiences that come through this sense in terms of 
variation in the three attributes of the strain, through 
blends with other senses, and through association with 
higher mental processes. 
Purpose. — The purpose of the sense of strain is to 
furnish information about position and movement of 
our own body and resistance. and weight of other ob- 
jects. Its significance is recognized when we realize | 
that it is through this sense that practically all our move- 
ments, from walking to eating, are reported. Practi- 
cally all habits of action are conditioned wholly or in 
part on this sense. Little do we know how dependent 
we are upon this obscure sense. Think of sitting, stand- 
ing, walking, eating, writing, driving a nail, singing, 
sport — indeed all habitual, careful, skilful, careless, 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  96 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
action; think of random movements, reflexes, habits, 
skill, grace; think of the humblest movements and of 
the most refined movements as in active sports and the 
arts and you may realize to some extent the important 
réle of this sense. 
Position. 
Exercise. — Eyes closed, with a pencil held close to the point, make 
a dot on a sheet of paper. Swing the arm freely in various directions 
over the paper and then try to put the pencil on the same point. Ob- 
serve by introspection the nature of your guide and record errors in 
ten trials. 
Before reaching out to pick up your pencil the eye 
tells the position of pencil and hand respectively. 
The position of the hand is also known by the sense 
of strain. The motor message sent to the muscle 
directing the movement is based upon position “ felt ” 
rather than seen. Think of the enormous amount of 
data the muscle must have, if we may speak figuratively, 
to anticipate and direct the correct position of each 
finger progressively in the grasp. Here sight was an 
aid and strain played a leading rdle. 
Movement. 
Exercise. — Make two dots about one inch apart. Put pencil on 
the right hand dot, and, eyes closed, lift it over to the other dot. Ten 
trials. Record how you know the extent of the movement. 
Sensation of position is at the basis of sensation of 
movement, as movement is merely awareness of succes- 
sive positions and the rate of change. We may speak 
of arm space, foot space, finger space, according as posi- 
tion, movement, and rate of movement, direction of 
movement, extent of movement, and distance of move-
-P-A-G-E-115
  
CUTANEOUS, MOTOR, AND STATIC SENSES 97 
ment are reported to us in terms of strain from the re- 
spective limbs themselves. We often see objects in an- 
ticipation of movement but the movement is guided in 
detail by the kinesthetic sense. In shaving, eg., a 
man looks into the mirror to find his face. He shaves 
by “ touch” and “hand space.’’ Analyze such an act 
as writing, chewing, or driving a nail, and observe how 
countless and fine the kinesthetic reports of movements 
are in guiding these movements. Yet we are so highly 
organized that the vast mass of them operate with pre- 
cision without reaching consciousness. The motor senses 
are at their best when they are automatic. 
Resistance. — Beginning with the bare sense of con- 
tact, pressure is supplemented by diffuse sensations of 
strain. This sense of resistance aids us in our adjust- 
ment of the force of movement as in grasping, pinching, 
plucking, biting, treading, hand shaking. 
Weight. — Weight is usually felt through active re- 
sistance in handling objects. If we analyze the percep- 
tion of weight of a hat, a teacup, an armful of wood, we 
find that, while other senses codperate, it is essentially 
this sense of strain in resistance that leads to the percep- 
tion of weight. Even when we merely look at an object 
we interpret its weight in terms of the motor senses. 
The kinesthetic sense is one of the most favorable 
for exact experimental study. Many laws applicable 
in other senses have been worked out and established 
most rigorously in this sense. One of these is Weber’s 
law which was illustrated in vision. Another large 
group of laws express normal illusions of weight of which 
the following is an example:
-P-A-G-E-116
98 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
The size-weight illusion.’ 
EXPERIMENT. — Take an empty but well inflated paper bag in 
one hand and match its weight with coins, nails, or other metal in the 
other hand Weigh the bag and the metal and record error. 
If the specific gravity of an object is lower than the 
central, neutral specific gravity, the weight of that object 
will be underestimated; whereas if the specific gravity 
of an object is higher than the neutral specific gravity, 
the weight of the object will be overestimated.* TIllu- 
sions of this kind occur for all normal persons,‘ and 
1See Author's “Psychology in Daily Life,” Chap. VI, Law in Illusion. 
2 These directions will mean nothing at all unless the experiment is actually 
and carefully performed. It must be experienced to be understood. In place 
of the paper bag any large, light object, such as a paper box or a down pillow, 
+ will do. 
3 For all normal individuals there is in every type of object a given weight 
which we may call neutral, for which there is no size-weight illusion ; all objects 
like it, but differing in size, are subject to the illusion. In general, objects which 
are smaller will be overestimated in weight, and objects which are larger will be 
underestimated. Thus all bouquets are underestimated, and all solid pieces of 
jewelry are overestimated in weight. Roughly we may classify on the’one side 
relatively light objects, such as feathers, paper, flowers, empty bags, clothes, 
and hay; and, on the other, relatively heavy objects, such as mercury, solid 
metals, stone, and perhaps water. Although there are numerous conditions 
which must be taken into account, and it is by no means a fixed ratio, we may 
have a rough knowledge of what ordinarily represents a practically neutral size- 
weight, or specific gravity, by remembering that a solid piece of oak wood comes 
near being neutral. Books are not far from neutral, though frequently heavier. 
Dry oak weighs about .65 g. to the cc.; books, .81 g.; and water, 1g. Letters 
and clothing are probably lighter. Or, to give a general intimation of the force 
of the illusion in common objects: if one bottle is seven times the volume of 
another, but is equal to it in weight and like it except in size, the smaller will seem 
to be about twice as heavy as the larger. If a ball weighs as much as a “Derby” 
hat, the ball will seem to weigh about twice as much as the hat. If a man is 
asked to match the weight of his golf cap with coins, it will be found that the 
cap actually weighs three or four times as much as the coins laid out in the 
estimate. In the above experiment, a piece of lead less than one-fifth of the 
weight of the bag will seem equal to it. Such comparisons as these may be tested 
in actual experiment by anyone interested. 
4 Normal illusions are like microbes; they are ever present, and they may be 
beneficent or noxious, but without them mental life as it now is could not exist. 
Since the discovery of microbes and the discovery of normal illusions, a man
-P-A-G-E-117
  CUTANEOUS, MOTOR, AND STATIC SENSES 99 
are predictable as to direction and approximate magni- 
tude. Similar experiments might be made to illustrate 
the conditions of perception of weight. Take a glass of 
water and observe how its apparent weight changes 
with the following conditions: (1) position of the glass 
in various positions within the reach; (2) the force of 
the grasp in holding; (3) the area of contact, e.g., finger 
tips or whole hand ; (4) rate of lifting; (5) the division of 
energy in grasping the table with one hand when lift- 
ing with the other hand; (6) temperature differences. 
Strain a space sense. — As a space sense the sense of 
strain has a capacity somewhat analogous to that of 
pressure. It is analogous to hearing in that the space 
is sensed largely in terms of intensity. We explain sev- 
eral types of visual perception of space in terms of 
energy of eye-movements. , It will also be recalled that 
the space relation of objects as we see them has come to 
have its meaning in terms of movement about the object. 
Thus, the kinesthetic sense has come to be the corner 
stone in our spatial construction of the world about us. 
EQUuILIBRIUM 
EXeERcIsE. — Seat yourself on a piano stool or swivel office chair 
and have some one revolve it (1) speeding up slowly, (2) speeding down 
slowly, (3) keeping a constant speed, and (4) stopping suddenly. 
Describe in what sense terms you experience the movement. Note 
also illusions of movement. 
The mechanism of equilibrium. — If we take a rubber 
tube the size of a pencil, fill it with water, and hold it in 
who holds himself free from illusions is like the schoolhouse janitor who in- 
dignantly resented the insinuation that there had been microbes in the school- 
house since he had taken charge of it. He had not seen a single microbe.

100 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
a horizontal position and at right angles to the arm at 
arm’s length, the following behavior of the liquid may 
be observed: turn to the right and the liquid will press 
against the left end as long as the rate of movement in- 
creases; turn at a constant speed and the liquid will 
remain quiescent ; slow up the movement gradually and 
the liquid will press against the right end of the tube; 
stop suddenly and the liquid will rebound. Other 
things being equal, the same principles will operate in 
any circle around the axis of the arm so that it would be 
possible to record beginning, acceleration, retardation, 
and the cessation of the turning in any direction in terms 
of change of the pressure of the liquid. This is the 
principle nature has adopted for our sense of equilibrium : 
it explains the results in the exercise. The device has 
taken the form of semicircular canals. There are three 
in each ear, one in each of the three geometrical planes 
of space. The nerve ending in the sensitive part of 
each canal registers change of pressure in the plane of 
that canal. The equilibrium part of the ear is much 
older than the hearing part. Birds and fish have very 
highly developed equilibrium organs as compared with 
the organs of hearing.’ 
1 As a result of the recent developments in aviation, much attention has 
been directed to the functioning of the sense of equilibrium. Scientific work 
is being done, particularly to determine the codperation of the vestibular 
system — i.e., the semicircular canals, the utricle, and the saccule in the ear 
—with other sense organs, in the maintaining of equilibrium in flying. The 
vestibular system is intimately associated with the eyes, so that disturbance of 
the ear is quite certain to affect the eye. It is well known that in dizziness 
the disturbance in vision is very conspicuous. The kinesthetic sense is per- 
haps even more intimately associated with the vestibular sense in the normal 
functioning of bodily orientation. Indeed, so far as we experience orientation, 
it is likely to be in terms of the visual or the kinesthetic sense, and possibly 
pressure,  
-P-A-G-E-119
  
CUTANEOUS, MOTOR, AND STATIC SENSES Iot 
Automatic. — Here is an anomaly: the sense organs 
of equilibrium give us no specific sensations. The per- 
ceptions of equilibrium, or loss of equilibrium, are couched 
mainly in terms of strain and pressure resulting from the 
reflex responses to stimulation of the semicircular canals. 
Disturbance of the semicircular canals results also in 
dizziness, but this is probably a secondary effect. Here 
is an organ which is of such basic importance for life that 
it is entirely automatic:' the receptors in the vestibule 
maintain equilibrium of the body by control of the 
tonus, or tension, of the muscles through the lower 
brain centers. 
1 But in this respect it differs only in degree from the other senses. The 
sense of strain in eye-movement functions in fine detail for most of the time 
that our eyes are open and even in sleep; yet many persons are not aware of the 
extent of these movements. Indeed all our senses gravitate in the direction of 
automatism, which is a mark of adaptation and organized service.

  CHAPTER VIII 
TRAITS OF PERCEPTION 
We have now traced sensory experience from the 
physical fact, which we call the stimulus, and the re- 
sulting physiological event, which we call the nerve 
impulse, through its first emergence as a mental process 
in the form of immediate awareness of the sense qualities, 
which represent all the sensory aspects of the objective 
world; and have traced its systematic variations in 
intensity, duration, and extensity, so woven by associa- 
tions into meanings as to give us knowledge of objects 
and their relations. In the present chapter we shall 
gather for further examination certain general traits 
of experience through the senses, particularly the nature 
of meaning, the réle of action, the place of feeling, and 
the degrees of fidelity of perception. 
MEANING IN PERCEPTION 
Sensation and meaning.— We have perceived an 
object, event, or situation when we have grasped its 
meaning with clearness and feeling in relation to action. 
- Sensory experience lies between the two extremes: 
pure sensation and complete meaning — the one the 
raw material, and the other the finished product. As 
102
-P-A-G-E-121
  
TRAITS OF PERCEPTION 103 
‘ we never in ordinary life experience pure sensation, so 
we probably never experience complete meaning: ex- 
perience is always more or less fragmentary. 
Exercise. — Drop five ink blots on a sheet of paper and squash 
them by laying another paper on top. Write under each ink blot 
as quickly and spontaneously as possible three names of objects that 
you see in the blot. Observe that there is a tendency to see real mean- 
ing even in such utterly contentless things as ink blots, that the 
actual ink blot changes radically as you pass from one meaning to 
another, that your mind overlooks some and fills in other details to get 
meaning, and that the meanings are quite personal to you. 
Meaning personal. — As James has said, all percep- 
tion is partial, personal, and purposive interpretation 
of definite and probable things. It is abridged for 
economy and efficiency by more or less automatic selec- 
tion of the minimum serviceable and satisfying to the 
individual. What we shall perceive in a given object 
depends upon the background or setting we can furnish 
from our entire personal past. We perceive in a thing 
what our knowledge enables us to grasp: witness the 
botanist and the child viewing the flowering meadow. 
We perceive what our feelings, instincts, and impulses 
crave: witness the sight of a dollar. We perceive to 
a large extent what we will to perceive: witness that 
there is none so blind as he who will not see. We are 
generous in our perception and ready to build up our 
meanings from the slenderest material: witness the 
Gibson girl created from a few bold strokes of the pen. 
We perceive what we expect to perceive: witness the . 
slowness in the discovery of common things. We are 
easily satisfied with partial and biased views: witness
-P-A-G-E-122
    104 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
the thousands of situations in which we are all old 
fogies. We realize the full meaning of situations ‘to 
the extent that we live, or have lived, them over in our 
self-expression : witness the devotion of the lover. We 
perceive full meanings of things only to the extent that 
we grasp their relations in such a way as to result in a 
feelingful attitude toward them: witness the flag. Thus, 
each of us lives in his personal world though our senses 
are open to the same materials, and each one finds in the 
new object what is relevant to him at the time.! We 
perceive in accordance with the limits of our experience, 
knowledge, feeling, and will, and are always ready to 
compromise by being satisfied with such perceptions as 
serve our need ; and in this there is beautiful design and 
wonderful economy. 
ACTION IN PERCEPTION 
We have seen how perception is not a matter of pas- 
sive impression, but a process of active construction in 
the development of meaning. Not only is perception 
an act of will, but it normally involves actual muscular 
movements. Let us examine the facts from the point 
of view of the motor aspects of the perception of space 
and time. 
1“Tt is clear that the same object can have different meanings for different 
individuals, as the lines of action must vary in accordance with the habitual 
associations. The same stream which means to the boy a swimming place, to 
the sportsman a boating place, to the fisherman a fishing place, is to the manu- 
facturer water power, to the chemist a combination of elements, to the land- 
scape painter a silver surface, to the engineer a place to be bridged over. The 
technical term for a-perception in which the relation to other objects pre- 
dominates is by a tradition which has become slightly old-fashioned apper- 
ception.” (Miinsterberg)
-P-A-G-E-123
  
TRAITS OF PERCEPTION 105 
Perception of space. — First, the mobile sense organs 
are equipped with inherited reactions called reflexes 
which facilitate and condition the perception of space, 
as in the eye adjustments, and even in the accessory 
muscles of the neck and chest. Pressure, temperature, 
pain, and the motor senses in the mobile parts of the 
body are likewise favored by motor adjustments, as 
in all forms of active sensing of pressure, temperature, 
and pain, and in all motor space through the kines- 
thetic senses. 
Second, spatial impressions are intimately associated 
with responses which are the result of the sense impres- 
sion itself and-are so intimately tied up with it that 
they occur before the true space perception as a mental 
process has had time to take place; and the sensations 
of these movements figure largely in the sensory blend 
of this perception. A pin prick or the sting of a bee has 
already been responded to by the time the pain is felt. 
Something threatens the eye and zt closes before J know. 
‘These movements are called reflexes. They blend grad- 
ually into voluntary action and play an important réle 
in our normal space adjustments through the senses 
because they facilitate the performance of the act, which 
is involved in the perception, without calling for active 
mental effort. This unconscious and immediate trans- 
ference of sensory impressions without delay or waiting 
for conscious response is a principle without which skill 
and grace in movement would be impossible. In so far 
as the impressions result in meaningful perceptions, 
they involve the original sense impression with second- 
ary impressions of associated responses. 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
    
106 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
Third, we find the concept of spatial relations in all 
the senses developed in terms of movement. The in- 
fant seeing the dangling red ball does not at first see its 
distance or size. These impressions get perceptual 
meaning when associated with reaching, clutching, and 
grasping movements. Meaning as distance, size, con- 
tour, or volume develops in terms of action. Even to 
the adult, such ideas as ‘‘ I have felt it,” ‘I have felt 
- around it,”’ “ I have measured it in some way of action,” 
are present in the background of visual perception. 
Fourth, impressions through the eye and other spa- 
tial senses must be vitalized by experiencing space in 
its functional relations as was shown above under mean- 
ing. The man can see what a boy is doing because he 
has been a boy; the old maid often cannot. What is 
going on before your senses has vital meaning to you 
just to the extent that you have lived the situation or 
something effectively analogous. The perception of 
things in space, then, is not a passive “ photographic ”” 
process, but involves a dramatic performance in the re- 
flex adjustments to facilitate the impression. The power 
of space perception develops to the extent that it is 
used. Perception develops essentially in play. 
Perception of time. — We have found duration an 
immediately given attribute of sensation, like intensity 
and extensity. To exist at all, a mental process must 
exist in time. But, in the perception of intervals of 
time, we estimate duration in terms of achievement — 
of what we did, do, or think of doing. As in primitive 
barter with goods, we have developed a system of valu- 
ing one thing in terms of another, using for basic refer-
-P-A-G-E-125
  
TRAITS OF PERCEPTION 107 
ence the periodic movements in our body, such as the 
beat of the heart, breathing, or the pendular swing of 
the legs in walking. Habitual imagery, such as the 
visual-motor image of the pendulum of a clock, or the 
motor image of the heart beat, dominates in our time 
perception. In music, we hear rhythm just to the ex- 
tent that we perform it in overt, inceptive, or imaged 
movements. Verify this in listening to a simple rhythm 
in music or poetry. If there is an error in time, you will 
observe it by the fact that the played time values fail 
to coincide with your self-acted time. Thus, the motor 
theory of time and rhythm is analogous to our visual in- 
terpretation of space in terms of tactual and kinesthetic 
experiences with objects. 
Just now I heard the clock strike nine. That is a 
time milepost. But so is breakfast, dressing, going to 
work; so are hunger and fatigue, in a vague way; so 
is the work of writing ten pages at a normal rate; so 
is the performance of routine duties ; so are the periodic- 
ities of light and darkness, rest and fatigue, and the reg- 
ular processes of occupation. Some of us “ rise with 
the birds” and “‘ go to bed when the chickens roost.” 
If we wake up at night and wish to know what time 
it is, we have recourse to. the signs of the light of dusk 
and of dawn, hunger, rest, milkman, traffic, the song 
of birds. 
FEELING IN PERCEPTION: AFFECTIVE TONE 
Two qualities. — All sensory experience is either 
agreeable or disagreeable. This feeling aspect of percep- 
tion we speak of as its affective tone. The dividing
-P-A-G-E-126
  108 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
line between the agreeable and the disagreeable is the- 
oretically a mathematical point; but practically there 
is a neutral zone in which the affective tone is below the 
threshold of awareness.! 
Speaking figuratively, things either attract or repel, 
or both; and the affective tone is our vague awareness 
of our automatic leaning toward or away from the ob- 
ject. The purpose of this “ leaning ”’ in perception is 
to facilitate the response by this unconscious adapta- 
tion for action. It is really an extension of the reflex, 
immediate, and purely unconscious response to sense 
impressions, which is a condition for the preservation 
of life. The reflexes take care of the simple, immediate 
responses in that taste, odor, pressure, and other sen- 
sations lead directly to movements of aggression or 
antagonism. The affective tone, as a conscious accom- 
paniment of perception, aids in the complex responses to 
the perception. The senses furnish the principal material 
for esthetic appreciation, both in nature and in art. 
As is proverbially known, pleasure is not attained by 
direct pursuit, so there is no immediate sensation of 
pleasure in sense experience as a message in itself. We 
do not experience pleasure in itself but in the pleasurable 
aspect of things, events, situations. We do not go out 
into the woods in the springtime to see beauty in itself, 
but to find pleasure in beautiful things. The affective 
tone of perception is a sort of concentrated and ele- 
mental evaluation of the thing in the very act of per- 
1Some psychologists regard this affective tone as a two-phased attribute 
of sensation. Our only reason for not recognizing this is that affective tone is 
not peculiar to sensation, but is present in all mental processes. The facts of per- 
ception are, however, aptly described from either point of view.  
-P-A-G-E-127
  
TRAITS OF PERCEPTION 109g 
ception. It lends richness, warmth and coldness, and 
‘vitality to sensory experience; it is our higher life pro- 
jected into the sensory experience. 
Complexity of the affective aspect. — Let us take a sim- 
ple example of feeling or affective tone, the pleasure of 
a whiff of odor from a rose. Even in such a simple 
process, limited in time to a few seconds, the situation 
is very complex. There is, first of all, an impression 
(sensation) of odor. The sensation of odor probably 
carries with it associations of color, form, softness, and 
other sense qualities. Images of these may even dom- 
inate in the perception of odor. In the act of perception, 
you are in the presence of a rose with all its meanings. 
Each of these associated meanings, even if only subcon- 
scious, follows the principle of stimulus-response and 
tends to run into action. Perhaps the dominant images 
are not even images of a rose but of an associated ob- 
ject, as garden, mother, sweetheart. Perhaps the dom- 
inant image, for a moment, is not even agreeable, but 
an image of death, rejection, financial distress. What- 
ever these associates may be, each tends to elicit re- 
sponse in the organism. From all these associated re- 
sponses comes a mass of sense impressions of the action 
and the attitude of the organism. The same stimuli 
act also upon the organs of secretion and circulation, and 
these in turn upon the brain in such a way as to raise 
or lower the level of mental activity. The pleasure of 
the odor is, therefore, the awareness of a rose as set in 
a diffused consciousness of attitude of the organism 
in response, intensified or dulled as the case may require. 
The agreeable or disagreeable is the rich and meaning-

ful knowledge of the rose as toned by the reactions of 
the organism.1 
HALLUCINATIONS AND ILLUSIONS 
Nature. — There are two stages in perception: the 
sensory cue and its interpretation or setting in all past 
experience. A perception in which the sensory cue is 
misinterpreted we call an illusion; a perception in which 
there is no sensory cue we call an hallucination. This 
is the conventional distinction between illusion and 
hallucination. Hallucinations and illusions are real 
perceptions in that they are experienced in sensory terms, 
and we believe in them exactly as in the case of a-true 
perception. I can imagine a ghost, but such a mental 
picture of a ghost does not become an hallucination, 
because I do not then actually believe that I see it, or 
am aware of it through some other sense. 
The rdle of the sensory cue in normal perception is 
greatly overestimated. For instance, you get a momen- 
tary glimpse of some part of a man on the street and in- 
stantly you say to yourself, “ That is John Smith.” Now 
perhaps the mark you sensed was a trifling one — hat, 
swagger, mustache. Some trifling part may set off the 
perception of the whole. This done, you feel, as in this 
case, that you have seen two eyes, two ears, nose, neck, 
fingers, possibly toes, and countless peculiarities in struc- 
ture, behavior, and the character of the man. In such 
1“The green trees, when I saw them first through one of the gates, trans- 
ported and ravished me; their sweetness and unusual beauty made my heart to 
leap and almost mad with ecstasy, — they were such strange and wonderful 
things. The skies were mine, and so were the sun and moon and stars, — and 
all the world was mine, — and I the only spectator and enjoyer of it.” (Thomas 
Traherne) A

a case the sensation is really insignificant; the percep- 
tion is an elaborate tying-up with itself of previous per- 
cepts in the original picture of the man as you know 
him to be. ‘“ I see John Smith” represents a complex 
affair initiated by a strategic group of sensations, selected 
by interest and set in the organized concept of the man 
as you might well think of him without seeing him at all. 
Now, suppose that upon the second glance you exclaim 
to yourself, “ Why, that is not John Smith; that is 
Sam Jones!” In that case your first experience was 
an illusion. It was a real perception; it was convinc- 
ing; it was believed in; it was clear; and yet, as events 
proved, it was a misinterpretation. 
Let us further suppose that it has grown dark and 
you are sitting on the veranda waiting for your very 
dear friend, John Smith. There is a rustle, a sound of 
footsteps, or a passing shadow, and you rise with a 
joyous exclamation, ‘‘ There he is!” only to find that 
you had been deceived; this, again, was an illusion. 
There probably are no genuine hallucinations; i.¢., 
perceptions without any sensory cue. All supposed 
hallucinations must be reduced to illusions — false per- 
ceptions, in which there is some sensory cue, however 
inadequate it may be.! 
‘Thus, we shall find that the bear in the bush is made 
1 This is well illustrated in a hypnotic experiment. The subject is hypnotized 
and told that he sees a picture of the king on the back of a card in a package of 
white calling cards. He asserts that he sees it. The cards are then shuffled and 
he is asked to pick out the card with the picture, which he does correctly. The 
cards are shuffled again, and this time the cards are turned around without his 
knowledge. When asked to find the picture again, he succeeds as before; but, 
immediately upon seeing it, he turns the card around because, as he says, the 
picture is upside down. Now in this case the subject probably fixes upon some 
trifling flaw in the paper as a starting point, a point de répére, which became his 
sensory cue, however inadequate. :

of the bush; and ghosts are made of shadows, and the 
like. The hallucinations of the insane are based upon 
some sensory irritation, and even our dreams are made 
of “dream stuff,” as we shall see later. It is, however, 
* convenient to retain the term hallucination for those 
illusions for which we are unable to trace any stimulus. 
Normal and abnormal. — A normal illusion or hal- 
lucination is one which occurs as a natural by-product, 
bias, or momentum, in normal mental life, and may be 
predicted under normal conditions. When abnormal 
illusions are present, the abnormality may be due to 
disease, physical or mental, or to any extraordinary 
combination of circumstances which may distort 
perception. Normal simply means common, average, 
or standard. 
We have seen in the preceding chapters that the senses 
furnish a rich display of normal illusions. The same 
is true for hallucinations, though not so easy to demon- 
strate. In normal waking life we probably see, hear, 
touch, taste, smell, and otherwise “ sense things ” which, 
if examined, are not these things at all. We persistently 
see colors which are subjective, such as in contrast, 
after-images, and transition colors. We hear rhythms 
which are purely subjective. We scent odors which 
are but the “ figment of the imagination.”” We con- 
stantly have a taste in the mouth. These experiences 
are all more or less normal. The dream furnishes us 
the most perfect specimen of a normal hallucination. 
The dream object is present, is actual, real, active, and 
convincing. It is a real presentation, but false. There 
are four large classes of hallucinations that are recog-
-P-A-G-E-131
  TRAITS OF PERCEPTION II3 
nized as abnormal. They are the hallucinations of the 
insane, the functionally sick, the hypnotized, and the 
highly suggestible. The reality of the suffering in func- 
tional diseases is sadly notorious, yet, from the point of 
view of psychology, natural andjorderly. The illusions 
and hallucinations of the insane are characteristically 
systematic, as in fixed ideas of persecution and the 
elational experiences of grandeur. 
The study of hallucinations of persons under severe 
mental strain, vivid anticipation, superstition, and ig- 
norance is one of the weirdest chapters of history. 
SYNASTHESIA 
The term synesthesia means “ felt together.’ With 
many of the sensory modes an entirely foreign sense 
quality may appear in the perception. In “colored hear- 
ing,” colors are associated with tones so that the moment 
the tone is heard it is also seen and projected in space as 
acolor. Each instrument may have a color accompany- 
ing its timbre; e.g., cello, indigo blue; clarinet, yellow; 
trumpet, bright red; flute, dark red. The entire pitch 
range may be represented in the colors of the Spectrum, 
high tones usually having bright colors and low tones 
dull. All the variations in the intensity, timbre, and 
volume of tones may be seen in corresponding nuances of 
color. Words, names, persons, the alphabet, etc., may 
appropriate color. : 
One of the commonest forms of synesthesia is “ num- 
ber forms”; names, letters of thealphabet, days, months, 
1On this point students should read a most illuminating book by Mr. C. W. 
Beers, “A Mind That Found Itself,” which is an account of the organization of 
perception that may prevail, even in the most acute forms of insanity. 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
TI4 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
etc., when thought of, are visualized in a fixed scheme out 
in space! To those who have them, to see these forms 
seems as natural as to think of anumber. To those who 
do not have them, they seem surpassingly strange. 
Another aspect of these concomitant sensations is a 
fixed association of feelings of agreeableness and dis- 
agreeableness for special tones, colors, odors, words, 
etc. Odors are particularly rich in these feeling asso- 
ciations. A further examination of the same principle 
is the personification of inanimate objects. There is, 
after all, but a step from the simultaneous presence of * 
two or more sense modes as in the taste, smell, and pres- 
sure of an apple to this synesthetic perception of an- 
alogous sense qualities and other objectification in 
space. Most of us have visual impressions of all objects 
that come to our mind. Number forms are merely 
habits of visualization represented in definite schemes. 
These schemes sometimes have a traceable origin, as 
in the division of the alphabet into two columns, the 
way they used to appear in the old primers. We are, 
therefore, disposed to question the physical explan- 
ation that has been offered in terms of proximity of 
brain centers and to say that synesthesia is a natural 
habit, though somewhat fanciful and weird.” 
1See illustration in Baldwin’s “Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology,” 
II, 464-5. 
2These phenomena are rather common. One investigator, examining 203 
college freshmen women, found 32 cases of colored hearing, 61 cases of number 
forms, and 17 cases having both. Estimates of frequency of synesthesia run 
from 5 to 40 per cent of normal persons. The numbers are unreliable because it 
is a question of degree. The synesthesia is more profuse and changeable in 
childhood; forms carried over into mature life become correspondingly fixed. 
Even after years have elapsed, the same space form and the same color scheme 
may persist.

TELEPATHY 
Telepathy or thought transference is the theory that 
communication between mind and mind may take place 
otherwise than through the known channels of sense. 
A vast amount of experimental work has been done in this 
field, particularly under the auspices of the Society for 
Psychical Research. Among these are the following 
types: (1) a hypnotic experiment in which the subject 
is directed toyreceive communications otherwise than 
through the known channels of sense, as when the hyp- 
notist tastes a substance and the subject is expected to 
experience the same taste, or as when the attempt is 
made to hypnotize a person at a distance without pre- 
arrangement; (2) waking persons attempting to trans- 
fer sensations from one person to another on the same 
theory; e.g., one observer will sit in one room and 
another in an adjoining room attempting to write down 
or sketch what is seen in the other room; (3) as in the 
feeling of being stared at when one person attempts to 
have another, seated some distance in front, turn around 
at a telepathic command; (4) answering questions 
mentally asked by a distant person; (5) apparitions; 
as where one party agrees with another that, at some time 
known only to himself, he shall appear; i.e., be seen 
in a hallucination on the conditions set by himself. 
The evidence from spontaneous cases is, of course, 
much more prolific. Premonitions, haunted houses, 
“hunches,” visions, inspirations, exaltations, super- 
natural guidance, the demon of Socrates, phantom 
voices of the dead, phantom sounds, countless super-
-P-A-G-E-134
  116 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
natural manifestations of mysterious modes of communi- 
cation, run in a channel from most primitive mythology 
to the most refined spiritistic cults of to-day. Between 
experiment and crass spontaneity lie many practices 
in mind reading for public entertainment, for pay, and 
more frequently for private devotion, and spiritual edi- 
fication. Here belong the claims of “second sight ” 
in the answering of sealed letters, the answering of mental 
questions, all the forms of muscle reading, the automatism 
in automatic writing, table tipping, planchette, and 
ouija board. 
A critical and detailed examination of the vast array 
of testimony for the alleged existence of the power of 
mind to transcend the laws of the senses is out of the 
question here. Investigations in this field have been 
profitable for scientific psychology in that they have 
revealed to us general laws and hidden resources of the 
human mind operating in this borderland field. They 
have given us valuable hints concerning the sources of 
error in psychological experiments, and have revealed 
to us the wonder of automatism and many of the mar- 
vels of the mechanism of personality. But have they 
proved telepathy? 
No one is better prepared by technical knowledge 
and insight to recognize such proof than the psychol- 
ogist; no one could be more eager than the psycholo- 
gist (unless it be the religious devotee) to welcome it. 
Wireless telegraphy, rightly so highly regarded in phys- 
ics, would be a crass trifle to the evidence of telepathy 
if it were true, but the general verdict of psychology 
is that telepathy has not been proved.
-P-A-G-E-135
    
TRAITS OF PERCEPTION Dry: 
Telepathy would offer an easy mode of explaining 
some of the most baffling situations in life, but, on pres- 
ent evidence, the psychologist is not justified in accept- 
ing telepathy as a principle of explanation. Yet he 
must either explain it or explain it away; 7.e., whether 
true or false, the alleged phenomena of telepathy should 
be considered in an extended study of psychology.

  CHAPTER IX 
ATTENTION 
Nature of attention. — To attend is to focus conscious- 
ness, to gain clearness of images or ideas, to make motor 
adjustments for clear impressions, to be prepared, to take 
an attitude of muscular tension, to anticipate the coming 
in pre-perception, to explore, to exercise curiosity, to react 
consciously to stimuli, to feel effort, to be interested, to 
will. Such phrases, although more or less fragmentary, 
are mutually supplementary indications of what we or- 
dinarily mean by the experience of attention. 
Attention is not a mental process in itself: it is rather a 
name for the form in which mental processes tend to 
present themselves and may be best described as the 
focusing of consciousness. The physiological explana- 
tion of this focus is to be found in the neural laws of 
stimulation, facilitation, and inhibition.t 
Our problem, then, in this chapter, is to gain some 
insight into how it comes about that, of the multitude of 
external impressions which are thrust in upon us, and of 
the vastly more intricate centrally aroused associations, 
only a few, and these often the desired ones, come into 
the clear focus of consciousness, while the vast mass is 
1 The principle of stimulation has been abundantly illustrated in the study of 
sensory experience; facilitation or selection will be explained in the treatment 
of the laws of association; and inhibition under such heads as instinct, impulse, 
and neural theory. 
118
-P-A-G-E-137
ATTENTION 119 
relegated into more or less remote recesses of marginal 
consciousness, the subconscious, or the purely physio- 
logical levels. 
We have used the term attention familiarly in the ac- 
count of sensory experience. We shall find that mem- 
ory and the learning process in general are interpreted 
in large part in terms of the mechanism of attention; 
that to imagine is to train the focus of consciousness in 
search for something new, somewhat as the beams of 
the search-light go out over the sea and here and there 
spot a distant vessel; that reasoning is persistent and 
planful focusing of consciousness upon successive fea- 
tures of similarity and difference in the relations among 
percepts and concepts; that will and action are ac- 
counted for largely in terms of attention; and that 
even feeling and emotion, which seem to be forced upon 
us organically, are modified and often enhanced or 
effaced by the course of attention. Yet, let us not forget 
that attention does not do these things; it merely de- 
notes that form of consciousness in which the sensation, 
the percept, the image, or the idea, stands in the focus 
of consciousness. 
Laws or ATTENTION 
In order to throw into relief a series of principles which 
operate in determining attentive consciousness, we may 
formulate a series of laws of attention, all of a somewhat 
practical nature, bearing in mind that the term “law ” 
is here used in a rather free sense, as indicating general 
tendencies or conditions. For the sake of brevity, the 
important distinction between the attracting of attention
-P-A-G-E-138
    
120 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
and the holding of attention is not elaborated in these 
laws, but must be constantly borne in mind. A few 
simple experiments will introduce the subject. 
Exercise. — (a) Hold your watch away from your ear at a 
point where you can “just barely hear the tick” and observe that the 
sound periodically appears and disappears, and this fluctuation is 
continued as long as you listen. \ Record approximately the average 
time of “sound heard,” and the average time of ‘‘ sound not heard,” in 
ten trials. 
(b) Change in attention. — Regard steadily the roundness of 
the period at the end of this sentence for one minute, and recall (after 
the minute) how your attention changed from object to object while 
you were doing your best to concentrate for one minute upon that 
point alone. Repeat, verify, and write full list of changes observed. 
(c) Movement. — Again, regard the roundness of the same period 
very. intently for one minute, and observe what bodily movements 
take place in this act of attention. Repeat, verify, and record full 
list of movements. 
(d) The division of energy. — Count consecutively, as fast as you 
can, from 1 to 100, and at the same time write consecutively, the num- 
bers from 1 upward. Record (1) time required, (2) how many num- 
bers were written, (3) reason for mistakes or halting, (4) if at any 
precise moment you attended clearly to both processes at the same time. 
1. Tension. — The attitude of attention is that of 
tension. Photography furnishes us a good illustration 
by analogy. The photographer wants a clear image on 
his plate; you want a clear image or idea in conscious- 
ness. Neither should be obtained by mere chance. 
There should be deliberate selection of object, approach, 
adjustment of instruments, readiness for recording, pro- 
vision for developing, and well-timed action, all of which 
imply a condition of bodily preparedness or suspense — 
muscular tension.
-P-A-G-E-139
ATTENTION £21 
This was well illustrated in Ex.c. You made all the 
necessary muscular adjustments for the focusing of a 
clear image upon the retina. You braced up bodily and 
threw your voluntary muscles into a state of suspense. 
The whole organism became tense. Some of these 
adjustments served immediate purposes, such as facili- 
tating perception or response, eliminating distraction, or 
controlling circulation and aération of the blood. Many 
were, however, reflexes which are only survivals of 
formerly useful action. The excitation of the internal 
organs of secretion was, although not observed directly, an 
important phase of this tension. Most of this bodily ac- 
tion was favorable to attention, and much was a neces- 
sary condition. Therefore, if you wish to attend, sérike 
an attitude of bodily tension ; brace up, and be in a position 
of readiness. 
2. Novelty. — Novelty is the most characteristic ob- 
ject of attention. Attention is a scout which tends to 
take notice of anything that is out of the ordinary — 
that.may be significant. In modern advertising, and in 
teaching, e.g., we find a remarkable array of devices 
for introducing novelty to catch attention and to hold 
it.. This law is conditioned upon the fact that we tend 
to grasp familiar units, objects, or events subconsciously ; 
z.e., without attention ; and it is well that we do so, — the 
less attention to these, the better. The real purpose of 
attention is to deal with new situations. It is in the in- 
terest of efficiency that we should not pay attention to 
99 per cent of the images and ideas which function 
efficiently in our stream of consciousness, and that atten- 
tion should be reserved for the fraction of 1 per cent
-P-A-G-E-140
    122 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
(to use figures very roughly), which call for new adjust- 
ment. The law may, therefore, be stated from two 
points of view: (1) that in the normal flow of perceptions, 
images, and ideas, we attend only to the novel, or that 
which calls for adjustment; and (2) that to attract at- 
tention, situations should contain elements of newness. 
The former of these rules is really a condition of the latter, 
for it is by trusting the automatic operation of routine 
processes that we reserve and hold available the pulse of 
attention required to meet new adjustments. Therefore, 
to cultivate the ability to meet new situations attentively, 
cultivate progressively the ability to make routine automatic 
and thereby throw new situations into effective relief. 
3. Intensity. — Attention rests primarily upon the 
law of intensity in association to be discussed in Chapter 
XI. Large, heavy, strong, severe, striking impressions 
and associations attract attention. In walking, we 
notice houses and trees more than individual pebbles and 
leaves; in eating, we notice the principal seasoning 
more readily than any one of the delicate elements of 
flavor; in thinking of virtue, we fasten more readily 
upon cardinal virtues than upon a minor virtue. How- 
ever, a loud sound, a strong light, a penetrating odor, do 
not in themselves hold attention, except for a short time. 
Softness, mellowness, delicacy, gentleness, often attract 
attention. Subtleness and hair-splitting in thought hold 
attention. We attend to anything because it is extremely 
large or extremely small, extremely strong or extremely 
weak, extremely complex or extremely simple. It is: 
the law of extremes, the extraordinary. The law of 
intensity must, therefore, always be interpreted with
-P-A-G-E-141
  
ATTENTION 123 
reference to the law of novelty and closely related laws. 
Nevertheless, other things being equal, this is the prac- 
tical rule: to attract attention, employ a strong impres- 
sion or association. 
4. Action. — The object of effective attention leads 
to immediate expression. The term “ action” is here 
used in both the physical and the mental sense to denote 
executing, or putting into effect. Thus, your eye catches 
an object and you turn to grasp it; your imagination 
focuses upon an idea and you pursue this idea mentally ; 
you have a sensation of contact in the neck, and you take 
cognizance of it. In all these cases, the follow-up action 
leads to trains of foci of attention, radiating consecutively 
from the original object of attention. It is like walking ; 
you may merely think of walking and get nowhere; but 
if you take the first step, you are in the position which 
precipitates you into the next. So in reading, searching, 
examining, discriminating, thinking — in any act which 
requires a movement of focal attention — you get the 
continuity by carrying ‘into action each focal image in 
turn. This is a rule against dawdling and day-dream- 
ing; it is the rule of alertness in continuity. As you 
cannot walk by taking an occasional one of the necessary 
steps, so in attention, each step must be executed in 
turn if you are to make progress. As you walk best if 
you follow a natural gait without interruption, so your 
attention becomes effective if each unit or idea in the 
mind is clinched in natural sequence. Therefore, to 
secure effective attention, express the object in mind in 
continuity of appropriate and consecutive action. 
5. Change. — There can be no continuous attention
-P-A-G-E-142
  124 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
to an unchanging object. Attention is action, explora- 
tion, hunting, pursuing. You found in Ex. 6 that there 
could be no effective standstill in the act of attention for 
any considerable period of time. Even in attention to 
the roundness of the period for a moment, the point of 
view changed: a series of features was noticed; the 
point of regard moved; you noticed in turn different re- 
lations of the period to adjacent objects; attention vacil- 
lated between percepts and ideas; there were marked 
periods of inattention; you did not attend to “ the 
roundness of the period”’ for one minute. The remedy 
is not to attempt to do the impossible; but rather to 
take advantage of this inexorable law of change by train- 
ing yourself to move the point of attention consecutively 
for a purpose at a favorable rate; i.e., to discriminate in 
turn a number of fine points of detail, the sum of which 
will constitute a relatively complete grasp of the object. 
In case of the period, change of attention about the 
roundness of the period would reveal, e.g., that it is not 
round, that the period seemed to move and change in size, 
brightness, and shape during observation, and that you 
saw a round fringe — all of which were relevant facts, and 
served to keep attention from wandering from its real 
object for want of direction. Poor attention chances 
upon a clear image now and then; but good atten- 
tion takes advantage of the law of change and pene- 
trates. Therefore, form the habit of regarding relevant 
features of detail within the specific object in rapid suc- 
cession. 
6. Periodicity. — Attention flows in waves. This 
was illustrated in Ex. a, where you found that, even with
-P-A-G-E-143
re eee ee ee 
ATTENTION 125 
the most extreme effort to hear the sound continuously, 
it appeared and disappeared with periodic regularity, de- 
pending to some extent upon the steadiness of the effort, 
the relative loudness of the sound, the absence of dis- 
traction, your keenness in marking the appearance and 
disappearance, and many other factors. Analogous peri- 
odicity, though not so easily observed, probably occurs in 
each of the other senses, and even in the higher mental 
processes. In this natural periodicity lies the foundation 
for rhythm in poetry and music, and even in plastic and 
‘graphic arts. But all forms of skilful, natural, and 
effective mental work in daily routine are organized upon 
the same principle; z.e., the conscious task naturally 
divides itself into units adapted to the natural pulsations 
of attention which average less than 10 seconds for the 
complete wave. 
But this is a periodicity within a periodicity. Ob- 
servers were required to listen to sounds of varying in- 
tensity and make the appropriate response every second 
during the two hours. The detailed records of achieve- 
ment by several observers show that there is a large 
periodicity in which the two-hour period tends to fall 
into three or four waves which we call hour or half-hour 
waves. Within these, we readily observe ripples, which 
have the same sort of regularity and may be designated 
minute waves; and within the minute waves occur 
the second waves of which we have just spoken. These 
second, minute, and hour waves, under the most exact 
conditions of experiment, come out irresistibly and give, 
in careful and stable observers, the same general 
characteristics. To these may be added the daily
-P-A-G-E-144
    126 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
period, for it is well known that our attention is at its 
best at a certain time in the day and at its poorest at 
another time, and there may be two or more waves in the 
diurnal period. Fig. 14 is a photograph of a vibrating 
flame, the contour of which beautifully illustrates and 
symbolizes this principle of periodicity within periodicity. 
The applied psychology of attention, therefore, urges 
that we so group our units of effort as to fit them into 
  Fic. 14. — The periodicity of attention 
natural second, minute, hour, and day periodicities, in 
which the achievement at the crest of the wave is made 
possible by the relaxation in the preceding vale. Nature 
exacts the fluctuation at seeming loss of efficiency ; but 
by skilful forethought we can take advantage of the pe- 
riodicity and vastly enhance achievement by working in 
well-timed spurts in conformity to natural fluctuations. 
The commonest application of this principle is in rhythm. 
Therefore, fit the task to the normal attention wave. 
7. Timing. — The attention wave is most effective at 
the crest. We may represent this roughly in Fig. 15 by 
assuming that, for a given time, e.g., five seconds, a certain
-P-A-G-E-145
  ATTENTION 127 
amount of energy is available and that this may take 
the form of a, b, orc; where a denotes relative inatten- 
tion or suspense under uncertainty, as where the time 
of occurrence is not known; 6 denotes a spread of pul- 
sation on account of a vague expectation that the object 
will appear during this. period; ¢ denotes a concentrated 
form of discharge which occurs when it is known that the 
impression will occur at 3. The three vertical lines, 
I, 2, 3, then denote relative efficiency of the grasp of 
attention under these circumstances. If the object 
came at y or z, in form ¢, the relative effectiveness would 
be indicated by these vertical lines respectively, as com- 
pared with 3.

Fic. 15.— Types of distribution of attention 
In laboratory experiments, where the observations must 
be made under the best conditions of attention, we there- 
fore employ warnings or signals, which mark off the com- 
ing of the stimulus one or two seconds in advance of its 
appearance, and thus enable the observer to catch the 
object in the peak of attention. This is a principle which 
is carried into effect in all our skilful use of attention 
by the operation of habits of making the necessary 
attack at the favorable time. In most mental effort,
-P-A-G-E-146
  128 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
either the object is free so that it can be caught on a 
momentary peak of attention, or, if recurrent, there is a 
periodicity or rhythm in which each period becomes the 
signal for the next following. Therefore, to secure the 
keenest attention,( catch the object at thepeak-of-a sharp 
attention wave._} 5 
8: Rest. — An attention crest can be obtained only 
at the expense of an attention vale. Well-chosen periods 
of rest favor attention. This principle is embodied in the 
timing, periodicity, and rhythm involved in the preceding 
laws, where nature automatically provides for recurring 
moments of relaxation in which there are natural periods 
of attention for day, hour, minute, and second (and neu- 
rologically hundredths of a second) groups. But aside 
from the periodicity of rest, we can give even momentary 
attention only to the extent that it is preceded and fol- 
lowed, almost immediately, by a more or less complete 
relaxation, as wasillustratedin Fig. 15. The best workers, 
in occupations which require what appears to be continu- 
ous attention, are those who can subjectively group the 
work into periods, or rhythms, so that there are recurring 
units of complete relaxation. The best worker is the best 
rester. In adding, for example, the expert runs down 
his column in clean-cut units, and, even when going 
at a very rapid rate, has proportionately longer periods 
of relaxation between each unit grasped than has the 
beginning plodder, who scatters his energies. The 
shorter units of rest are bridged over by the feeling of 
continuity, which we have found is an illusion. In study- 
ing this lesson, you get the best result if you have come to 
it from a short period of complete relaxation, and have
-P-A-G-E-147
ATTENTION 129 
thrown yourself with unfailing persistence into an effort 
to master the new situation, and then relax completely 
when a given task is done. A poor student often works 
all the time; the good student revels in abundant relaxa- 
tion. Relaxation, diversion, change, play, sleep, are 
primary conditions of effective attention. But never 
mix relaxation and work! Let there be a clean-cut 
periodicity — incisive distinction between your exertion 
and your relaxation. The period of rest may be compar- 
atively short. A ten or fifteen minute nap after the 
midday meal may add the equivalent of hours of effec- 
tiveness to the afternoon work. Three minutes of com- 
plete relaxation when you feel dullness coming on may 
add an hour of effectiveness to your study. Therefore, 
to keep attention at its best, provide adequate and_timely—_ 
relaxation. 
9. Grouping. — Attention is effective in proportion 
to the capacity for grouping in large units. If an in- 
stantaneous exposure is made of a group of letters, you 
can grasp in a single span of attention, without eye 
movement, from threé to sixletters. Butif the letters 
are arranged in words of four or five letters each, you 
can grasp almost as many words as isolated letters. 
That is to say, attention is favored by the grouping of 
coherent units. It is a significant fact that the scope of 
attention does not depend so much on the size or com- 
plexity of the object, as upon its meaning. A long, 
familiar word, such as university or psychology, is grasped 
as easily as a short word, such as rear or tow. In the 
psychology of reading, we find the most interesting appli- 
cation of numerous principles which determine the span
-P-A-G-E-148
  
130 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
of attention. A child attends to the letter, or part of 
the letter and, through the art of reading, gradually learns 
to extend his span of momentary attention in such a way 
as to use larger and larger units, running through the 
letter, syllable, word, sentence, and paragraph. The same 
principle applies to abstract thought. We develop ca- 
pacity or skill chiefly through the acquisition of capacity 
for holding larger and larger organized units in the atten- 
tion span. Therefore, to improve attention, organize 
progressively larger and larger units of grouping for the — 
AMllention span. 10. Division of energy. — We can attend to only one 
thing at a time. In Ex. d, even though both processes 
moved smoothly together, you did not give focal attention 
simultaneously to the two processes at any moment. Fail- 
ure to notice this is merely inadequate introspection. 
What happened was that the attention oscillated in 
flashes from one to the other, and the two processes could 
go on simultaneously to the extent that one or both, at 
a given moment, was either automatic or could be carried 
on in the marginal consciousness. Speaking and writing 
numbers are both well-learned processes, so that the stable 
observer may save time by doing the two together, 
particularly after a little practice, because attention is 
required only for certain critical moments in each act, 
and these critical moments can be met in turn, — not si- 
multaneously. The study of the character of conflicts 
and mistakes throws much light on the réle of attention at 
such critical moments. 
The fact that we can give focal. attention only to one 
feature at a time should, however, not discourage us
-P-A-G-E-149
  ATTENTION 23 
from doing two or more things at the same time: indeed, 
we should cultivate the ability to be undisturbed by 
parallel activities, and to be able to concentrate upon only 
the critical moments of each in turn. The stage performer 
who keeps from two to ten balls in the air without being 
flurried is a model in this type of skill. He tosses the 
balls high enough to allow him ample time for each one, 
and the task seems easy and graceful because he pays 
no attention to any ball except at the critical moment. 
Even the most complicated feats of conversation, observa- 
tion, memory, and reasoning may be carried on simulta- 
neously in this way through specialized training of a 
gifted person. In our ordinary duties of the day, we 
frequently do more than one thing at a time. If we did 
not, we should be quite helpless. This must not, how- 
ever, be mistaken for encouragement to scatter our en- 
ergies; on the contrary, it is a charge to concentrate at 
the critical moments. The significance of this principle 
is not so much in the ability to do several things simulta- 
neously, as in the use of attention economically in one 
thing at a time. We chose the illustration of the at- 
tempt to divide attention to demonstrate that this cannot 
be done except by oscillation from one process to the 
other, and in this way, to illustrate the significance of 
critical moments. Therefore, to cultivate effective atten- 
tion, train yourself to conserve attention for critical mo- 
ments only. 
11. Purpose. — The readiness with which a feature 
shall become focal in consciousness varies with the 
definiteness of the point of view in anticipation (purpose), 
and the facility for referring the new experience to a known
-P-A-G-E-150
  
132 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
class. This is the law of apperception, which was illus- 
trated in the sections on Meaning in Chapter VIII, and 
on Illusions in Chapter IV and Chapter VII. Its ap- 
plication to the higher mental processes can readily be 
made. ‘ 
What shall become focal in your stream of consciousness 
when you encounter a new object, situation, relation, or 
event depends upon your point of view or purpose at the 
moment and your capacity for pigeonholing it promptly in 
some known class of past experience. Even the simplest 
object or event may have dozens of meanings. What 
it shall mean to you in terms of attentive consciousness 
depends upon the purpose you have in mind. The blur- 
ring of meanings is as confusing as the blurring of ob- 
jects in the securing of a clear image. It is as impor- 
tant to have a single purpose at a time as it is to have 
a single object at a time in focal attention. Attention 
that conforms to this rule is called expectant attention. 
Therefore, to secure expectant attention, anticipate the 
coming new feature from a selective point of view and refer 
it to its appropriate class. 
12. Interest. — The feeling of interest results in an 
attitude favorable to attention. Attention has often 
been described in terms of interest, but it has been well 
said that things are interesting because we attend to 
them : we do not attend to them because they are interest- 
ing. Nevertheless, interest is a pleasurable feeling which 
forms a part of the cycle of the process which constitutes 
sustained effort. It may be regarded as the affective 
phase of the state of attention, or as a mood which accom- 
panies it. We, therefore, speak appropriately of interest  
-P-A-G-E-151
ATTENTION - (86 
as a condition of attention in education, play, art, sport, 
and work, and thereby mean that the mind is entirely 
engrossed upon the object of attention so that the feel- 
ing of pleasure sustains a favorable attitude for continued 
passive attention, with a minimum effort. This in- 
terest cannot be gained by direct effort; like happiness, 
it must be sought indirectly through a wise choice of occu- 
pations. Therefore, to hold attention, so order your life 
as to cultivate an attitude of interest in what you do._ 
13. Effort. — Attention is an aspect of will. Indeed, 
attention has often been described in terms of mental 
effort, or will emanating from a self, person, or being, 
somewhat beyond and independent of the psycho-physi- 
cal organism. Without entering upon the very compli- 
cated issues involved in that matter, we may point out 
that the feeling of effort which we have in paying atten- 
tion is made up essentially of kinesthetic sensations of 
strain, coming as a result of the mass of physical activities 
involved. However, the effort, will, decision, or inten- 
tion involved in the act of voluntary attention may be 
regarded as a general attitude of the mind resulting from 
consciousness of purpose, consciousness of the means of 
attainment, and consciousness of the outcome, so con- 
centrated in one moment of focal consciousness as to 
favor the various motives of attention. This is what 
is implied in the command “ Attention! ”’, the exhorta- 
tion “ Pay attention,” or the will to attend. Effort thus 
understood denotes a vital step in the causation of at- 
tention and is often taken to designate the total ex- 
perience in attention as self-expression. Therefore, to 
secure the most effective voluntary attention, do not
-P-A-G-E-152
  134 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
merely permit, hope, or desire attention, but make an in- 
cisive effort to attend. 
14. Form. — Attention may be divided into volun- 
tary, involuntary, and secondary passive. The best 
form is secondary passive. Voluntary attention is that 
form which requires marked effort and deliberation; 
involuntary that which occurs spontaneously as the re- 
sult of some feature in the situation; secondary passive 
attention has in common with voluntary attention a pur- 
pose, and in common with involuntary attention facility 
and economy of effort. It develops when the act has be- 
come more or less passive, as a result of the selection, sur- 
vival, and development of vital purposes or interests 
which more or less automatically lead to precise anticipa- 
tion and sustained gratification in habitual action. In 
other words, secondary passive attention occurs in con- 
nection with derived or cultivated interests as distin- 
guished from sporadic interests. What in the first in- 
stance may be voluntary attention should, for permanent 
use, be made progressively passive. That is to say, if 
you want to strengthen attention on a large scale, do not 
depend upon sheer effort in the individual act, but culti- 
vate the habit of appreciation of and desire for the class 
of things to which you want to attend. Therefore, cud- 
tivate the secondary passive form of attention. 
15. Skill. — Attention functions through organized 
groups of skill. Although concentrated attention repre- 
sents a moment of intense consciousness, it can be ob- 
tained and sustained in effective precision or periodicity 
only by the operation of a hierarchy of habits, each more 
or less automatically codperating to bring about this con-
-P-A-G-E-153
  ATTENTION 135 
dition. The above laws each designate such habits. The 
habit of clean-cut attack, the habit of relaxation, the 
habit of anticipating in pre-perception, the habit of hit- 
ting hard, the habit of ignoring distraction, the habit of 
carrying image into action, the habit of bodily attitudes, 
the habit of observing in terms of meaningful units, these 
and many others, in a well-ordered life, should function 
quickly, easily, and harmoniously to bring about the 
moment of even the most rigidly voluntary attention. 
Effective attention is not a thing to be brought about by 
original and independent mental effort, but represents a 
skill based upon the gradually acquired system of habits. 
Therefore, to acquire the power of attention, cultivate 
(i.e. train yourself in) the fundamental habits of precision 
and alertness, which are necessary conditions for ready and 
effective effort. 
Bopity Action IN ATTENTION 
Focusing movements. — Physical movements accom- 
panying attention are so conspicuous that many authors 
have thought that attention consisted essentially in such 
bodily movements. It is to be noted, however, that they 
do not precede attention, but usually follow, or accom- 
pany the act of attention. These movements may be 
classified into three or four groups. We have, first, the 
adjustment of the sense organs necessary for clear per- 
ception. This is best illustrated in the act of vision. For 
example, if we are to make a fine distinction in the ex- 
amination of an object, the whole body, or at least the 
head, turns in the direction of the object ; the eyes engage 
in scouting movements to locate it and turn so as to
-P-A-G-E-154
  136 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
throw the image upon the point of clear vision, converge 
for distance, focus for a clear image, and adjust for 
appropriate illumination. These movements are, there- 
fore, a condition of clearness in the image, which is the 
characteristic of attentive vision. Similar, though not so 
mobile, adjustments are made in each of the other senses. 
Accessory movements. — There is another class of 
movements which are accessory to these, and result in ° 
a general adjustment of the body, tending to throw all 
the voluntary muscles into a state of tension, the body 
being in a state of suspension, like a trigger ready to go 
off. There is a general tendency of reaching for the 
object, or in some other way apprehending it. In 
viewing a beautiful sunset, there is a tendency to step 
forward, instead of back, away from it. In listening 
intently to a person speaking, we approach or lean 
forward, but as soon as the attention lapses, the muscles 
relax, and wé fall back. It is just as essential in atten- 
tion that the muscles of response shall be cocked, as it is 
that the muscles of sensory reception shall be focused.? 
Movements by analogy. — In all attention, we find 
an exceedingly interesting recapitulation of move- 
ments which in the past have been useful in analogous 
situations. By a very interesting biological principle, 
many such adjustments are made inceptively, or more 
or less overtly, in acts of attention where perception, 
through a sense organ, is not involved. When we try 
to recall the shape of an object, there is a tendency to 
1 An illustration occurs at the moment of my dictating this paragraph : I caught 
myself having pinched a note, which I held in the hand so tightly that I suddenly 
became conscious of a painful strain in the hand, the result of the general at- 
titude of muscular tension in attention.
-P-A-G-E-155
ATTENTION 137 
make all the movements of visual adjustment for actual 
seeing, or in thinking of a sound, to make the adjustments 
for listening. Although they serve no direct function, 
they facilitate attention to the image or idea. In a 
similar manner, the attitude of readiness for response is 
taken in attending to objects which do not call for motor 
response. This is a phase of the language tendency 
in the use of gesture, and facilitates attention because 
it gives form for the expression in muscular tension. 
In like manner, there is a tendency to point toward the 
organ of attention, the forehead or the brain. When a 
person is trying hard to recall an event, there is a tendency 
to put the hand to the head, as in the famous attitude of 
the philosopher. The same is true of the sense organs. 
In thinking of something seen, heard, or tasted, there is 
a tendency to locate, usually with the hand, the sense or- 
gan concerned. Likewise, in attention to what a partic- 
ular muscle has done or should do, there is a tendency 
to- locate it by touching this particular limb or organ. 
Think of soft velvet, and you will observe a tendency to 
feel with your fingers in the absence of the cloth. 
One of the most interesting series of illustrations of 
these movements is to be found in so-called muscle read- 
ing, where the artist in this form of mind reading has 
become skilful in guiding himself by the unconscious 
movements which accompany attention to the flow of 
images. These movements seem peculiarly mysterious 
because, often, they are as unconsciously apprehended 
as they are unconsciously expressed, and our mind reader 
is conscious only of a sort of intuition about what to do, 
and often recognizes the act only after it has been per- 
   
-P-A-G-E-156
  I, 38 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
formed. This is illustrated in all forms of mind reading 
which involve contact, as in leading a person to find 
a hidden object. However, guidance need not come 
through contact ; it may come through any of the senses 
which convey information about the unconscious move- 
ment of the individual of the group. Where there is a 
group of persons, or an audience available, the sounds 
resulting from all sorts of movements expressing changes 
of attention become an adequate guide, so that the stage 
performer can walk out into an audience and find a 
hidden object entirely from such cues. 
The motor theories. — Such unconscious movements, 
by analogy and survival, enter into all our normal activi- 
ties of the higher mental processes and furnish a large part 
of the basis for a motor theory of the perception of rhythm 
and the motor theory of perception, conception, and think- 
ing in general. We have already seen interesting illus- 
trations of these, as in the illusion of weight, where we 
found muscular adjustments indicative of the movement 
of attention so marked that they were regarded as the 
cause of strong and persistent illusions. 
Many of these accessory movements are regarded as 
overflow effects resulting merely from spread of stimu- 
lation of a specific set of muscles; but ordinarily, we find 
in this “ spread ” a remarkably fixed application of the 
principle of analogy, so that in the hundreds of traceable 
movements involved in thinking, e.g., of your telephone 
number, each and all may be traced back into this most 
intricate network of surviving movements on the principle 
of analogy. Thus, the wrinkling of the forehead, 
the biting of the teeth, the pressing of the feet, the in-
-P-A-G-E-157
  ATTENTION 139 
hibition of movement in stopping to listen and holding the 
breath, may be regarded as accessory movements, having 
in the past been essential for the functioning of the sen- 
sory or motor organs. Even though they do not now 
serve a direct purpose, these survival activities may be 
regarded as facilitating attention by favoring a general 
attitude of mobility and tension. Indeed, some of these 
movements are so clearly indications of attention that we 
measure the effectiveness of a speaker by the quiet in the 
room and pronounce the audience as inattentive when 
there is a beginning of rustling and relaxation. 
Action of glands. — There is another class of move- 
ments, far more significant, but perhaps more difficult to 
observe because they take place in the action of the inter- 
nal organs of secretion, circulation, aération, and metab- 
olism. ‘It is safe to say that the concentration of atten- 
tion is correlated with an extremely complicated system 
of secretions, not only in the ductless glands, but by stim- 
ulation from these, throughout the entire system of circu- 
lation and metabolism.) To concentrate attention means, 
for example, to set up a rush in the circulation in the 
brain somewhat in the same way as, when a fire occurs 
in a small village, more steam is turned on in the power 
plant to get pressure. The increased and focalized brain 
activity which corresponds to attention is manifested in 
modifications of the pulse rate, breathing, and tempera- 
ture, which are outward signs of contractions of the 
arteries, increased action of the heart, and increased 
chemical activities from the internal secretions which 
may be roughly proportional to the intensity of the 
mental effort experienced. 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  T40 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
Indeed, we may say in general, that there is no exertion 
of attention without correlated bodily expression. Some 
of these movements facilitate the apprehension of the 
object, others are accessory to these, and still others are se- 
quels in action; but by far the largest mass of muscular 
movements are survivals by analogy to movements that 
have been useful in the past. In this idea of accessory, 
sympathetic, and survival movements in attention we 
find the key to the behavior in all mimicry and gesture.

CHAPTER X 
MENTAL IMAGES 
In Chapters II to VIII we have examined the expe- 
rience of presentations through the senses as they occur 
when the object stimulates the sense organ. Our prob- 
lem in the next few chapters is to examine mental life 
in the process of re-instatement, re-presentation, re-pro- 
duction, and pre-production of past and future experi- 
ence. 
Exercise. — With eyes closed, visit in memory and imagination 
the yard of a familiar home. Count the windows of the house, pick 
a flower and hold it to your nostrils, eat a bit of luscious fruit, 
and listen to the singing of the birds. — Did you see? Hear? 
Smell? Taste? Feel muscular strain? Pressure? Warmth? 
Number your answers in the order of the clearness of the experience. 
Nature of images. — Mental images are the mental 
representations or pictures of things not present to sense. 
When an object is present to our senses we perceive it ; 
when, in its absence, we recall or imagine it, we may image 
it. The presentative experience is a percept; the repre- 
sentative experience is animage. ‘The content of memory 
and imagination consists primarily of mental images of 
things, situations, events, or traits, as recalled or im- 
agined. This is a general tendency of all representation, 
even the memory or imagination of abstract facts, such 
as happiness, goodness, or truth; for we have a tendency 
to represent these abstract qualities as embodied in 
141
-P-A-G-E-160
    142 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
concrete situations, such as exhibitions of happiness, good- 
ness, and truth. ; 
The child may be several years old before he becomes 
aware of the fact that he has percepts of color, form, tone, 
or taste. So the youth may even reach the class in 
psychology before he discovers that he lives in a world 
of mental images; yet this imagery constitutes the main 
bulk of his mental life: Even scientific men were not 
aware of the existence of mental images until about 
half a century ago. Sir Francis Galton first wrote, in 
1875, to scientific men and asked them if they had visual 
images; and, finding that they did, he sent out another 
inquiry asking if they had images of sounds, tastes, and 
odors. This shows that, although these images may be 
very realistic when called to our attention, we are not 
ordinarily aware of the images as such, but of objects; 
just as in perception we are not aware of the percept 
but of the object. Verify this last statement by looking 
at the furniture in your room and then recalling it with 
eyes closed. 
Function of images. — The purpose of the image is to 
make memory and imagination complete, immediate, and 
realistic, — to reinstate the original experience in lifelike- 
ness, and bring into actual experience the form, color, 
odor, temperature, weight, etc., of the absent object. With- 
out imagery we should be able to recall only the abstract 
ideas and the names for objects, and it is doubtful if we 
could recall even the names for things without verbal im- 
agery_of the things; for names are themselves imaged as 
seen, heard, or felt. Imagery, then, gives us the power 
to pass in mental review things of the past or things —
-P-A-G-E-161
  MENTAL IMAGES 143 
to come for examination, for enjoyment, and for guidance 
in our. daily life. It gives continuity to experience in 
that the past and the future may be lived into the present 
realistically. 
Difference between percept and image. 
Exercise. — Look at this book and see the shape of the page, the 
style of print in this paragraph, and the punctuation after the word 
“exercise,” and observe that the whole percept is clear, relatively com- 
plete in detail, sustainable for a long time, and under control so that 
you may turn from detail to detail as you please. Now close your 
eyes and recall in turn these impressions of the book. Write down 
how the image compares with the percept in (1) vividness, (2) minuteness 
of detail, (3) stability, (4) control of the point of view, (5) correctness 
or fidelity, and (6) consciousness of the presence of an object. 5 
The differences here observed are characteristic of the 
fundamental difference between presentation (percep- 
tion) and representation (memory and imagination). 
The attributes of the image.— The image has the 
same attributes as the sensation; namely, quality, 
intensity, duration, and extensity. Just as we explained 
all things in sensory experience in these four terms, so we 
find that all that we can remember or image of the mate- 
rial world may be accounted for in terms of these four at- 
tributes of the image. Just as we are able to identify only’ 
a small portion of sensation in our rich sensory experience, 
so we are limited in our ability to isolate and become 
clearly conscious of the image at all stages in our very 
rich representative experience. The reason for this in 
both cases is that the sensation and the images operate 
so naturally and constantly that ordinarily we do not 
notice them: we notice the object, not the medium of its 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  
I44 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
construction. Yet it is in terms of sensation and image 
that we represent our entire experience of the outer world. 
The image is the thing that is present in consciousness of 
things past and of things to come; also, in large part, of 
things present. 
The rating of imagery.!— This exercise is devoted 
to a test of the capacity for vividness of imagery. It is 
a distinct exercise in introspection. It is best to keep 
the eyes closed as you introspect. 
Fix clearly in mind and use as consistently as possible 
the following scale of degrees of vividness: 
o. No image at all. 
Very faint. 
Faint. 
Fairly vivid. 
Vivid. 
Very vivid. 
As vivid as in perception. DAunhwnd Hw 
Answer ‘the following questions by writing after the 
number of the question the number which denotes the 
degree of vividness characteristic of your image.?  Pre- 
pare a table for this purpose. Introspective notes to 
supplement the numerical answers are very desirable.

Experiments in Psychology. 
2 To some students this exercise will be entirely too easy; to others, equally 
bright, it will seem like an impossible task. The reason for this difference lies 
in the fact that one person may have such vivid imagery that it is as easy for 
him to answer the first question as to say whether or not he-sees a rose which is 
held before his open eyes, while to another person the task seems unreasonable; 
for, with the best effort, he cannot see the slightest evidence of any concrete 
image, nor does he know what it is to have such an image. These are extreme 
types, between which normal types range. The student who finds difficulty 
should not be discouraged. The aim of this exercise is not to develop imagery, 
but to test the actual normal capacity.

I. Viswal.— Can you image (1) the color of a red 
rose, (2) the brightness of a white teacup, (3) the form 
of the rose, (4) a moving express train visually, 
(5) simultaneously, a group of colors ina bunch of sweet 
peas, (6) a comparison of the color of cream and the

ten seconds ? 
Il. Auditory.— Can you image (r1) the sound of the

III. Motor. — Can you image, in motor terms, (1) your- 
self rocking in a chair, (2) the movement of a water- 
fall, (3) aside from the actual inceptive movements, a

Compute the averages for all the answers in each of the 
experiments I to VIII, and plot a curve showing the 
relative vividness of the image in each of these senses.

  146 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
Such factors as vividness, stability, and integrity of the 
image do not necessarily vary together. An image 
may be very vivid but flitting; it may be complete but 
faint. For a full study of the capacity, the above 
questions might be repeated and answered in turn with 
reference to each of the variables in the image. This 
same exercise might be used for the determination of 
such factors as the stability of the image, completeness 
of the image, or effort in producing it. In such cases, 
words representing stability, completeness, effort, etc., 
would be substituted for the word vivid in the scale; 
e.g., no image, very fluctuating, fluctuating, fairly stable, 
stable, very stable, as stable as in perception. 
Exercise. — This rating has been a clear-cut exercise in systematic 
introspection, exhibiting the advantages and disadvantages of this 
method. Write out a comprehensive list of (a) the advantages and 
(b) the shortcomings of this method. 
Imaginal types. — Compare your chart with those of 
other persons and you will be surprised at the difference. 
Argue about it and you will discover remarkable things 
about imagery. Look into it as into a mirror and see 
how truly it characterizes your consciousness of the outer 
world. Evaluate the realism of your memory and imagin- 
ation in terms of this chart as compared with the actual 
sensory experience. Consider whether these facts have 
any bearing on your vocation, interests, temperament, 
and emotions. 
It can be readily understood that the world seems dif- 
ferent to different individuals aceording as they repre- 
sent it in memory and imagination as something seen, 
something heard, something touched or smelled, some-
-P-A-G-E-165
  MENTAL IMAGES 147y 
thing experienced through all the senses, or, in an ex- 
treme case, without any images at all. Such differences 
exist. Some of the most intelligent men maintain that 
they employ no imagery, while a more than equal num- 
ber maintain that their imagery is as complete and as 
effective as the original perception. A representative of 
each of these extremes seems like a monstrosity to the 
other. Between them normal persons distribute grad- 
ually with a bunching about midway. But there are 
also significant individual types. In most of us, the 
visual image dominates ; 7.e., we are visualizers. /Many 
have a dominant motor imagery: they are the motiles. 
Others have more conspicuous auditory imagery: they 
are the audiles. Then there are cOmbimations, such as 
the visual-motor and the auditory-motor. We also 
speak of high and low imagery types) Although there 
are no pure types, the tendency toward types is con- 
spicuous and the distinction is helpful. Normally all 
senses function in imagery, and the rank of each tends 
to be approximately that of frequency in perception. 
The visual image ordinarily comes first and easiest, 
simply because most of us habitually think of objects as 
seen. The several codperating images of the same ob- 
ject appear in different order. (nm the recall of a hand- 
shake, e.g., the situation may first be seen and then followed 
up by motor, tactual, and temperature images of the shake, 
and finally perhaps of the auditory image of the spoken 
greeting, although these are all represented as happening 
in the same instant) (Che motor image is most difficult to 
identify, partly because we have formed the habit of

and largely because the motor images are nearly always 
accompanied by sensations of actual or inceptive 
movements. Many persons have a prevailing verbal 
imagery; they observe the tag instead of the content of 
the package. Thus, in thinking of dogs, they may get a 
clear image of the word dogs, as seen, heard, or spoken, 
and no image of the animals may appear.) Many have a

tendency to take that intermediate step in all imaging. 
Thus, in the above rating exercise, they image the word 
sugar readily and image the taste of sugar only after great 
effort. Quite often persons assert that they have no 
image of a particular kind, but a crucial objective test 
may reveal its appearance beyond question.

dents, and children of the fifth and eighth grades. The 
distribution for the children of both ages was found to 
coincide so nearly with that of university students that, 
when smoothed, the distribution for unselected adults 
and children was represented in the same curve. After 
making due allowances for sources of error, the legend of 
this curve remains striking. Musicians rate themselves 
high in auditory imagery; psychologists, as a class 
representing the scientific mind, rate themselves low. 
Unselected adults and children tend to follow in a middle 
curve. It is interesting to find that musicians regard 
imagery as essential to a real appreciation of music as do 
also most psychologists, and that psychologists differ in 
opinion as to whether they have never had this gift or have 
suppressed it by their devotion to abstract thought. 
Most great composers can “ hear out ” music before 
writing it and again in reading the score, before going to 
an instrument. The player often plays by an imaged 
standard. The listener who can relive the music of yes- 
terday has greater resources than the one who merely re- 
calls abstract forms. Motor memory plays an impor- 
tant réle in music in that it is in large part the stuff of 
which musical emotion is made. 
Stories are told of artists who, after having seen a 
sitter for a portrait for a single time, could pose him . 
through mere imagery as often as desired. While im- 
agery is essential in all realistic art, it is peculiarly helpful 
with those arts which create form. 
The significance of imagery. — Superior imagery is 
not necessarily a mark of intelligence. The prominence 
of images seems to vary quite independently of the degree
-P-A-G-E-168
  150 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
of intelligence. But the type and the degree of imagery 
profoundly affect the kind of intelligence. Compare, 
for instance, the musician who recalls and imagines 
music in abstract terms with the musician who hears it 
as effectively in recall or in composition as if actually 
performed. Compare the artist who represents his 
subject in exact detail and in the same position as long 
as necessary with the one who cannot visualize. Compare 
the child whose representations are abstract, cold, and 
barren, with the child who relives an experience and 
anticipates the future vividly in imagery quite as realis- 
tic as a perception. Such comparisons amount almost to 
a comparison of the blind and the seeing, or the deaf and 
the hearing. Capacity for precise visual imagery is 
undoubtedly one of the marks of talent for painting, 
architecture, and sculpture; and musicians who have 
poor auditory imagery apologize for the defect. Similar 
vital bearings may be pointed out in countless routine 
occupations. 
What sense shall vie with vision for prominence depends 
upon dominant interests and attitudes; or, shall we say, 
dominant interests in life are determined by native type 
of imagery? Has the musician turned to the world of 
sounds because he was born with good auditory imagery, 
or has he developed auditory imagery because he deals 
with sounds? Think out an answer to these and analo- 
gous questions for each of the other senses. 
' Evolution of the image. — In animal life the image is 
undoubtedly the primitive form of consciousness above 
the sensation level. In the consciousness of past experi- 
ences and anticipation of the future, it probably had the
-P-A-G-E-169
  MENTAL IMAGES I5t 
same sort of immediacy as perception has forman. When 
the animal, which has encountered danger in a given posi- 
tion, again comes to that place, it reéxperiences the danger 
setting as a part of the actual present experience in that 
place; i.e., the past is present in the form of an image. 
This image is not recognized as a memory of the past, 
it is merely an element of the present sensory experience. 
Perhaps the homing instinct is guided largely by im- 
agery. When the bird migrates from the Gulf to Can- 
ada and back, season after season, it is probable that 
he guides himself, not by conscious recognition of land- 
marks, but by the play of imagery creating the feeling of 
familiarity in the present sense experience of the guiding 
marks, such as the Mississippi River. From such primi- 
tive blending of past with present there has probably 
been a gradual evolution up to the present conscious- 
ness of isolation of image from other experience, and 
voluntary control of the image. 
Development of the image. — It is generally believed 
that children employ imagery more than adults and that 
children picture actual objects and specific instances, while 
adults think in terms of symbols of objects, usually words 
or generalized notions. The adult undoubtedly does 
more abstract thinking than the child, but it is conceivable 
that the adult may also have better imagery than the child, 
because he has wider experience to draw from and may 
have developed precision in this imagery by use or train- 
ing in a narrow field. However, the vast mass of occupa- 
tions tend to dwarf the development of imagery. The 
way to develop imagery is to give it something to do, —to 
use it. The best proof of the possibility of developing 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  152 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
i agery by use is found in the case of those who are 
early deprived of the higher senses and are forced to repre- 
sent vital situations with extreme vividness and accuracy 
in such senses as pressure, strain, or odor, as in the case 
of Helen Keller. Training in discriminating observation 
results in corresponding development of precision in the 
image.

  CHAPTER XI 
ASSOCIATION 
EXERCISE. — Have some one time you to find how many words you 
can speak in seven seconds, starting with a keyword called by your 
assistant. Speak as fast as possible, taking the words in order as 
they come to mind without thinking! Practice until you can speak 
at least nine words within the time set. Record five such trials with 
explanatory comments. 
In this exercise you observed, among other things, 
that what came to your mind was a procession of images 
in various senses; that there was a scramble among these 
images for recognition; that they came much faster 
than you could recognize or speak them; that it was 
possible for you to go back and fill in many images of 
the procession which served as connecting links, although 
you did not have time to mention them; that there was 
a natural association, or bond, from image to image; 
that, although by direction you spoke faster than you 
could think and did not try to select words that were 
related, natural relationships exist for every link in the 
chain; and that in each “story”? you unconsciously 
and irresistibly revealed something of yourself. 
1 Example: “Keyword, friend: mine, Mame, Carolyn, Baraboo, Wisconsin 
university, Duffield, California. (1) Mine came from the frequent association 
of the words ‘friend of mine.’ (2) Mame is one of my dearest friends and this 
name was probably favored by similarity of sound (mine, Mame). (3) Carolyn 
was a chum of Mame and myself. (4) Carolyn lives in Baraboo. (5) Baraboo 
is in Wisconsin. (6) Our friendship was formed in the university. (7) Duf- 
field was the portliest and most good-natured of our gentlemen friends at that 
time. (8) Duffield lives in California.”

  154 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
Nature of association. — Such observations may be 
summed up in the statement that objects, events, situ- 
ations, ideas, feelings, and acts are always experienced 
in some relation; and, when we are conscious of any 
part in that relation, other parts tend to follow: those 
factors that have been present together, or in succession, 
or have some common elements, tend to recur together. 
Let us call the key word, or other starting point, the 
“cue.” Any mental process may serve as a cue which 
draws in its associates in this manner. Every mental 
cue tends to reinstate its former associates. This is the 
principle of association which is the groundwork of all 
experience. It will be well for us to observe it in a few 
typical situations, as in perception, memory, imagina- 
tion, and feeling. 
Association in perception. —In perception impres- 
sions get their meaning by being set in past experience 
through association. Consider the first time you saw 
an airplane. The cue for the perception lay in certain 
visual sensations. These were “set”? in numerous as- 
sociated images and reactions — flying, bird, wings, 
power, danger, sport, speed, height, invention, genius, 
a ride, skill, gravity, etc. The mental act of seeing the 
airplane for the first time called forth these and nu- 
merous other associates which gave meaning to the per- 
cept and thus became tied up with it. They flocked 
in instantly and irresistibly the moment you “ saw” 
the plane. Each of these associates was dragged in 
through some bond (association) formed in previous 
experience. Each, being thus welded as links into a 
new chain beginning with this sensory impression, there-
-P-A-G-E-173
  ASSOCIATION 155 
after remains associated with every other. The whole 
experience may have occupied but a moment, and it is 
only as you stopped to review the experience that you 
became clearly conscious of any of them; yet scores of 
them were present in the meaning—airplane. In 
this manner each new experience is tied up with past ex- 
periences through this tendency to set each new expe- 
rience in its natural association with our experience as 
a whole, directly or indirectly. Perception always in- 
volves association. 
Association in memory. — The same thing happens in 
memory, the process of reinstating former situations : 
some experience serves as a cue to bring its associates 
into consciousness. When we are able to identify this 
train of associates as meaning particular things or 
events which we recognize as a part of our past, we have 
memory. 
Recall the front door in your childhood home, and 
" observe this act of memory carefully. Instantly, upon 
this request (cue—something seen) there flashed into 
your mind, perhaps, the image of the door of your room. 
This image of a door was followed at once by the image 
of the door of your home with fragments of the house, 
garden, folks,.voices, movements, special pleasures or sor- 
rows, etc.; but, by special attention, you soon rejected 
all the accessories and concentrated your mind on the 
clear and correct image of the door. All this, perhaps, 
happened in “ the twinkling of an eye.” Close obser- 
vation at the time would have revealed in you signs of 
feeling and inceptive tendencies to action appropriate 
to the occasion, all of which were again unconsciously
-P-A-G-E-174
  156 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
woven into the fabric of the associations. How did you 
remember this door at will? Simply by following trains 
of associations until that image appeared which you 
“felt” was the right one. Perhaps the process was so 
automatic that you were aware of the right image in- 
stantly and were not conscious of the setting or the 
steps involved any more than when your eyes fall 
upon the door in front of you now and you instantly 
perceive it asa door. Yet many links led the way even 
so. It is only when we stop to analyze such common 
acts that we become aware of the complexity of the 
process and the orderliness in the operation of the laws 
of association in such a simple act of memory. 
Association in imagination. — Imagine that the book 
you are reading is printed in all the colors of the rain- 
bow and note carefully the process of your imagination. 
A good observer may find something like this: the re- 
quest serves as a cue which may bring to consciousness 
two images — the book and the rainbow. The colors 
of the rainbow may appear in their true order, the book 
in its true size. The problem, then, is to satisfy your 
feeling with the imaginary arrangement of the colors 
in the type. Many possibilities present themselves 
(associated images) as the result of following different 
lines of associates from the cue. These are rivals for 
recognition and favor. Finally one is recognized as 
best suited for your purpose. You project that upon 
the page, real or imaged, and throw the competitors into 
the dim background. Possibly you still vacillate; then 
the rivalry persists in action on the page. Or perhaps 
in your fertile imagination you recognize in clear succes-
-P-A-G-E-175
ASSOCIATION 157 
sion one arrangement after another as worthy of your 
approval. The mechanism of imagination then is asso- 
ciation. Percepts, images, ideas, and feelings are the 
materials associated. 
Association in thought.— Think out the answer to 
this question: Does the color of the rainbow serve any 
purpose? Observe your mental process in this act be- 
fore reading further. 
What happened? Perhaps the image of the rainbow 
came to mind and then followed images of examples of 
purposes, some relevant and some irrelevant, such as a 
bridge, a work of art to give pleasure, protective color- 
ation in animals to attract mates, and the like. The 
difficulty lay in finding, among such examples, some- 
thing that might be like the rainbow in serving a pur- 
pose. Then arose a succession of images of things in 
nature that give pleasure. After following up chain 
after chain of such associations and reviewing many of 
them, you gradually arrived at a conviction, which ex- 
pressed your judgment, either affirmative or negative. 
Thinking, then, is a process of association — the pro- 
cess of solving problems by following different chains of 
associations in search of a conviction — truth. 
Association in all mental life.— In this manner as- 
sociation is the bond of experience, conscious and un- 
conscious. It is the groundwork of all mental life. In- 
stinct is the unconscious association formed in the life 
of the species; habit is the unconscious association 
formed in the activities of the individual; feeling is the 
mass formation of undifferentiated associations; im- 
pulse is the breaking out of the associations into action
-P-A-G-E-176
  158 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
under the sway of feeling ; imitation is a blind following 
of associations with behavior of others; will is associa- 
tion controlled by selective attention; animal thinking 
is mere association. On the other hand, deviation from 
the normal is a disturbance of association; hysteria, 
altered personality, insanity, are dissociations or false 
associations. 
Primary laws.— Since the time of Aristotle much 
effort has been spent in an attempt to classify the various 
kinds of association. The commonest kind of classifica- 
tion is three-fold: contiguity, similarity, and contrast. 
But the general tendency of the present time is to subor- 
dinate all under one head, contiguity, or the law of rein- 
statement: things that have been associated in any way 
in previous experiences tend to reinstate themselves 
together. This embraces all kinds of recognized rela- 
tionships; such as contiguity in time — flash of light- 
ning, thunder; contiguity in space — door, door-knob ; 
cause and effect — pin prick, pain; purpose — knife, 
cut; synonyms — glorious, grand; similarity of all con- 
ceivable kinds — similarity of purpose, of appearance, 
of meaning, of operation, and an equal number of oppo- 
sites, or contrasts. In brief, the law of reinstatement is 
a recognition of the fact that the mind tends to integrate 
in a new situation those common elements which were 
experienced together in former related situations. What 
shall be reinstated in a new experience depends in part 
upon what kinds of bonds exist. The primary laws of 
association denote what kind of relation exists. 
Secondary laws.— In experimental psychology a 
more specific formulation of laws in terms of force of
-P-A-G-E-177
  
  ASSOCIATION 159 
the association has gained recognition. The chief of 
these are: (1) primacy: other things being equal, the 
association first formed will prevail; (2) recency: other 
things being equal, the most recently experienced as- 
sociation will prevail; (3) cntensity: other things being 
equal, the most strongly experienced association will 
prevail; (4) frequency: other things being equal, the 
most frequently experienced association will prevail ; 
(5) emotional congruity: other things being equal, that 
association which is most congruous with present feeling 
will prevail. This last is not as rigid as the other forms ; 
it embraces a variety of conditions which modify the 
mental set or attitude of the individual. 
The secondary laws of force operate within the pri- 
mary laws of kind. Thus, contiguity in time is effective 
only as it has been experienced primarily, recently, in- 
tensely, or frequently. The same is true of all other 
kinds of contiguity, similarity, or contrast. 
Exercise. — Secure three series of associations as in the above 
exercise, and indicate at each stage what secondary laws were operat- 
ing. 
Norms of frequency in association. — The following 
table of associations is typical for unselected normal 
persons. The word in italics at the head served as a cue. 
It was spoken by the examiner, and the observer was re- 
quired to speak in response the first word that came to 
his mind. The aim was to respond as quickly as pos- 
sible. The reaction time of each response was recorded. 
1 It will be observed that sometimes more than one law operates and very 
often the connection must be traced through images in the train of associations 
which were omitted in speaking.
-P-A-G-E-178
  160 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
It is here observed that for each cue word there are cer- 
tain natural associates which are most frequently chosen.

The association reaction in psychoanalysis. —In re- 
actions like these, the observer, if prompt, may reveal 
his mental content in spite of his will or intentions to 
the contrary. Thus it is found that it is possible to 
classify persons of different occupations, education, 
criminal tendencies, and talents by such sampling of 
the natural but rushed association. Perhaps the most 
interesting use of the association reaction is that intro- 
duced by Jung in the attempt to discover the cause of 
certain mental diseases for the purpose of cure. Here 
is a man, for example, who is suffering from melancholia 
and sits around useless and distressed because he is so 
“unworthy.” Given a list of words to which to react, 
it was observed that when he came to the word “ short ” 
he hesitated to give one of the most natural responses, 
such as long or I; he took a long reaction-time, showed 
1The number shows how many times this association occurred in 1000 
cases. From American Journal of Insanity, Vol. LXII, Nos. 1 and 2, 1910.
-P-A-G-E-179
  ASSOCIATION 161 
embarrassment, and responded with an irrelevant word. 
It was found later that the associate he had evaded was J. 
A number of related responses gave evidence of the same 
“ complex.” } The physician drew the conclusion that 
this insanity was due to the fact that this man was small 
of stature. He had come to think of himself as un- 
worthy, incapable, socially undesirable, insignificant, 
etc., and these thoughts and feelings had expanded in 
vicious circles resulting in a feeling of helplessness, de- 
spair, and negativism which resulted in melancholia, 
all coming from the idea ‘“‘ small of stature’? which he 
himself did not think for a moment had anything to do 
with his present deplorable condition. The early con- 
sciousness of shortness, the physician says, had resulted 
in a repression; 7.e., the unconscious concealment of an 
undesirable association or fact. 
It has been observed in certain types of cases that the 
cure consists in laying bare, through analysis and rea- 
soning with the patient, the fact that his present disease 
is nothing but unfortunate associations with the simple 
fact, e.g., that he is short. Here the whole disease, 
which is a rather common one, lay in a chain of false 
associations ; and the cure lay in retracing and clearly 
revealing the falseness of these associations. 
The association reaction in the detection of guilt. — 
An experiment has been devised by which it is possible 
to detect whether a person knows or does not know a 
certain thing, or is guilty or not guilty of the act. Sup- 
pose you have in a distant room two boxes, one contain- 
1A complex, as the term is used in medical psychology, is a persistent group 
of associations that lead to mental distortion; hence, dissociation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  162 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY. 
ing a revolver and one a frog, and a man is asked to step 
into the room and look into one box only and you under- 
take to determine by means of the association test which 
box he looked into. You take his reaction-time for as- 
sociation in a list of words, such as house, tree, print, 
business, fear, green, trigger. Green and trigger are 
relevant words — one for each box. If, for example, he 
has seen the revolver, the natural association for trigger 
would be revolver. He catches himself, thinking that 
saying revolver would give him away, so his reaction- 
time is lengthened by the time taken for thinking and 
he responds with a more distantly associated word, e.g., 
“trap.” The certainty of the finding is increased by 
using a number of relevant words in a long list of words. 
Closely observed, it would also be seen that he experi- 
enced embarrassment when the relevant words were 
spoken. This in itself is enough to solve the problem. 
The physical basis of association. — We have thus 
far discussed association from the mental aspect, or ex- 
perience. But association is a psychophysical process — 
mental-physical. Indeed it may be described from 
either the mental or the neural side. The two are, as 
it were, aspects of the same whole. Since association 
is the basic process in all mental life; and, since it can- 
not be explained or understood fully without reference 
to the physical aspect, we shall now digress for two chap- 
ters to bring up the physiology of association, approach- 
ing this subject through a study of reflex actions.
-P-A-G-E-181
CHAPTER XII 
REFLEXES 
Ir we proceed upon the assumption that the brain is 
the organ of consciousness, it may be interesting to know 
what an animal can do without a brain. It has fallen 
to the lot of the frog to demonstrate this most frequently. 
Spinal reflexes in the frog. — A frog is said to be reflex 
or pithed when its brain has been separated from the 
spinal cord. This may be done by severing the cord at 
the back of the brain and removing the brain with a 
probe. A simpler way is to decapitate. If we then sus- 
pend the animal, so that its limbs are free, we may ob- 
serve that, as long as the animal is not disturbed, it will 
hang relaxed, still, and inert without breathing, swal- 
lowing, croaking, or even a twitch of muscle — in every 
respect as if it were dead. It has no power of starting 
any movement of its own. With the frog thus pre- 
pared, we may perform the following experiment : ! 
Pinch a toe: the toe withdraws. Pinch another toe: 
that toe withdraws. Pinch or prick the frog at any 
place and the appropriate defense or withdrawal action 
will follow. Put a drop of diluted acid on the shank: 
the appropriate limb properly brushes it off. Place a 
drop of acid on any part of the body: in every case 
1 This experiment must be performed either as a demonstration in class or 
by the individual student. Mere reading about it would be inexcusable and of 
only superficial value. 
163
-P-A-G-E-182
  164 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
the appropriate wiping movement takes place. Heat 
a nail and touch different parts in the same way, as in 
pinching: appropriate results follow. Send a light 
electric shock to. different parts, as in pinching: the ap- 
propriate responses follow. Vary the force of the shock : 
the magnitude of the movement increases with the force 
of the shock; larger and larger groups of codrdinated 
muscles are brought into action. Send shocks through 
the back at the rate of ten or fifteen per second: the 
whole animal becomes rigid. This rigidity is called 
tetanus. 
What have we learned from the experiment? We 
have observed that, if undisturbed, the frog makes 
no movement and remains quiet as if dead; but, when 
stimulated, it will behave with extraordinary alertness 
and appropriateness to all the stimuli tried. It is sen- 
sitive to mechanical, thermal, chemical, and electrical 
stimuli. The responses are prompt, specific, appropri- 
ate, and adequate. They vary with the location of the 
stimulus and the force of the stimulus, but not with the 
kind of stimulus. A repeated succession of stimuli pro- 
duces tetanus. 
_ Yet if our assumption be correct, which we may grant 
for the present, the reflex frog felt no pain, pressure, 
heat, injury, or shock; no discomfort, no unpleasant- 
ness, or suffering of any kind as a result of the stimula- 
tion: it was not aware of anything. It did not initiate 
or intend any movement; it was an automaton; i.e., 
it behaved in a mechanical way, like a jumping jack; 
yet the performance had all the appearance of being 
sensitive, reasonable, intended, and felt.
-P-A-G-E-183
REFLEXES 165 
Reflexes in other animals. — This principle of action 
may be observed in all animals, including man. A dog, 
whose spinal cord has been severed in the same way, if 
touched lightly, as by the crawl of a flea, will at once 
balance itself on three legs and paw off the stimulus 
appropriately with the fourth. Some of the cold-blooded 
animals, even the frog, may be cut up into segments, 
and each segment may for a while perform the reflexes 
of that section of the spinal cord which is left intact. 
It was once observed that, after an execution, a decapi- 
tated man’s hand came up and brushed off a tickling stim- 
ulus on the breast; but in general it is easiest to demon- 
strate these reflexes in the lower animals, because the 
general effect of the shock of the operation is not so great 
on them. 
Reflexes from the lower brain centers. — According 
to best authorities to-day, the cortex of the cerebral 
hemispheres is the organic correlate of consciousness. 
By removal of the hemispheres we shall then remove all 
possibility of consciousness; such as sensation, memory, 
feeling, and will. In the reflex frog we removed the whole 
brain. The complete central mechanism for the reflex 
actions observed was therefore in the spinal cord. 
The next higher centers, the medulla oblongata, the 
optic lobes, and other ganglia between the spinal cord 
and the hemispheres of the frog, are each proved by ex- 
periment to contain a mechanism for the accurate execu- 
tion of movement in response to definite stimuli and for 
coérdination of more complex processes. Thus, with 
the medulla the animal swallows; with the medulla 
and cerebellum together he jumps, swims, and turns
-P-A-G-E-184
  166 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
over from his back; with his optic lobes, he croaks when 
pinched. 
‘A frog which has lost his cerebral hemispheres alone is 
by an unpracticed observer indistinguishable from a nor- 
mal animal. Not only is he capable, on proper instiga- 
tion, of all the acts already mentioned, but he guides him- 
self by sight, so that if an obstacle be set up between him 
and the light and he be forced to move forward, he either 
jumps over it or swerves to one side. He manifests the 
sexual instinct at the proper seasons and discriminates 
between male and female individuals of his own species. 
He is, in short, so similar in every respect to a normal 
frog that it would take a person very familiar with these 
animals to suspect anything wrong or wanting about 
him; but even then such a person would soon remark the 
almost entire absence of spontaneous motion — that is, 
motion unprovoked by any present incitation of sense. 
The continued movements of swimming, performed by 
the creature in the water, seem to be the fatal result of 
the contact of that fluid with its skin. They cease when a 
stick, for example, touches his hands. This is a sensible 
irritant towards which the feet are automatically drawn 
by reflex action, and on which the animal remains sitting. 
He manifests no hunger and will suffer a fly to crawl over 
his nose unsnapped at. Fear, too, seems to have deserted 
him. In a word, he is an extremely complex machine 
whose actions, so far as they go, tend to self-preservation ; 
but still a machine, in the sense that it seems to contain 
no incalculable element. By applying the right sensory 
stimulus to him we are almost as certain of getting a fixed 
response as an organist is of hearing a certain tone when 
he pulls out a certain stop.’’! 
The manifestations here described of the frog are typi- 
cal of all animals with a central nervous system. There

are different levels of neural connections. The lowest 
and most firmly established is that of the spinal cord, 
which is the organ of the simplest reflexes; but the me- 
dulla, the cerebellum, and the lower brain ganglia have 
similar functions. 
Reflexes in man. — We have drawn these illustra- 
tions in reflexes from a lower animal because it is pos- 
sible to submit such an animal to exact experimental 
control in observation; but diseases, accidents, and sur- 
gical operations often present opportunities for verifying 
these observations in man. In general, it is found that 
man is built on the same plan of nervous organization 
as the higher animals; the principles of reflex action, 
which are demonstrated on these animals, hold in gen- 
eral for man also. They are, however, not so evident in 
man because they are so overshadowed by the promi- 
nence of the higher brain centers. While it is not possible 
to enumerate all the reflexes, and there are all kinds and 
degrees of transition from pure reflexes to higher forms 
of neural action, the classification recently made by 
Warren, Table I, is illuminating.

The conditioned reflex. — Recent work, particularly 
by Russian physiologists, Pawlow and Bechterew, has
-P-A-G-E-187
    REFLEXES 169 
given us interesting methods of studying the function 
of the complex processes through the reflexes. One of. 
these is known as the method of the conditioned reflex. 
It may be employed in many ways, the principal one 
being that of substituting one stimulus for another in 
the arousing of a reflex. Most of the experiments have 
been performed on animals, but they may be employed 
with man as well. 
Let us take the salivary reflex as an example. The 
salivary reflex.is to the effect that the awareness of food 
sets up a secretion of saliva. A capsule may be placed 
over the salivary gland in such a way as to collect the 
saliva as it is secreted. This saliva may be measured 
both as to quantity and rate of discharge. This fur- 
nishes a means then of recording how our reflex varies 
with numerous conditions which we may control. 
Take, for instance, a girl who likes chocolate and ob- 
serve her secretion of saliva by means of such capsule. 
Normally the secretion of saliva sets in when she begins 
to eat: when she is not hungry and is not in the pres- 
ence of food, no saliva is secreted. Let her see a cake of 
chocolate and instantly the saliva will begin to flow; 
put the cake in her hand and the saliva will flow faster. 
Now, to get a conditioned reflex, we may adopt any 
signal or cue that we wish to substitute for the chocolate. 
Thus, we may in successive trials crumple a paper in the 
pocket and forthwith produce the piece of chocolate. 
The sight, touch, or taste of the chocolate produces the 
reflex, but the chocolate soon becomes so associated with 
the crumpling of the paper that the mere crumpling of 
the paper without the presence of anything to eat will
-P-A-G-E-188
  no INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
start the salivary reflex. The crumpled paper has, then, _ 
been substituted for chocolate as a stimulus. The sound 
of a bell, the flash of a light, a touch on the shoulder,— 
any signal,— might be injected into the reflex in this 
way, and we should always have a means of measuring 
the force of the substituted stimulus in the rate of flow 
of the saliva. 
In the case just described the method of reward was 
used. Methods of punishment may be used on the same 
principle. Take, for example, the reflex of withdrawing 
a limb from an electric grid in response to an electric 
shock. By associating other stimuli with the electric 
shock we may establish the conditioned reflex as above. 
Suppose that you wish to measure the form discrimina- 
tion of a dog. Let the dog stand on a grid through 
which an electric shock may be sent through its front 
feet by pressing a button. The shock causes a reflex 
jump. Now suppose that in a series of trials you flash 
a circle and a square and give the shock simultaneously 
with the circle; but with the square no shock is given. 
If the dog can recognize the differences in the shape, he 
will soon learn that no shock comes with the square; 
whereas it always comes simultaneously with the circle. 
After some practice on both, the dog will respond with 
the reflex to the circle whether the shock is given or not, 
and will not respond to the square, showing that he sees 
the difference. The difference in form may then be 
gradually reduced in successive experiments until we 
find the dog’s least perceptible difference for the form. 
This is perhaps the fundamental type of method in 
the so-called objective psychology or behaviorism. It 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
  REFLEXES 171 
has obvious limitations but promises much in the way of 
a rigid objective check in psychological experiments. 
The method can also be used in simple observation, as, 
e.g., in the observation of likes or dislikes for any partic- 
ular object or situation by a systematic observation of 
the reflexes of the inceptive smile or the inceptive frown. 
After this exhibit of neural action, we are prepared to 
recognize the great réle of unconscious action in all ex- 
perience and behavior, and are ready to inquire eagerly 
into the nature of neural action — the function of the 
nervous element, the nature and behavior of the nerve 
impulse, and the theory of the physical basis of asso- 
ciation, which we shall now review briefly in the next 
chapter.

  CHAPTER XIII 
NEURAL THEORY 
Structure of the neurone. — The unit of the nervous 
system is the neurone, which is a sort of battery with 
its connections capable of receiving, generating, and 
transmitting nerve impulses. The nervous system, as 
a whole, consists of approximately ten thousand mil- 
lions of these batteries with their connections so ar- 
ranged as to constitute countless courses for nerve 
currents. (For illustrations of neural structures see 
Appendix.) : - 
The typical neurone consists of a cell body and its 
branches. The structure of a particular neurone is de- 
termined by its function and location. The vital part 
is the nucleus in the cell body. This is embedded in a 
substance called cytoplasm, which contains a granular 
substance through which nerve fibrils radiate into the 
branches. The branches are of two kinds: the dendrites, 
which carry nerve impulses into the cell body; and 
the axon, which carries the nerve impulses out of the 
cell body. The dendrites are short, tapering, tree-like 
branching projections from the cytoplasm. There is 
ordinarily but one axon. A cross-section of this reveals 
a structure similar to that of our common lamp-cord: a 
central cable of fibrils — the axis-cylinder serving as a 
conductor; a white, fatty insulating substance — the 
172 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
    
NEURAL THEORY 173 
myelin sheath; and a capsule, serving as a protection 
and container of the more delicate parts. The axis- 
cylinder may be of any length from a fraction of a milli- 
meter up to the distance between the tip of the toe 
and the spinal cord.

all animals; but the higher the animal, the more pro-

174 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
fuse is the arborization, or branching of the neurone. 
This difference and the order of growth in the develop- 
ment of the neurone are illustrated in Fig. 17. 
Grouping of neurones. — In the structure of the cen- 
tral and peripheral nervous system, the neurones are 
so bunched into ganglia or centers and joined through 
cables of nerve fibrils (axons) as to secure the most effec- 
tive and economic functioning. (Thus, nerve trunks are 
formed by laying cables composed of the axons of in- 
coming (sensory) and outgoing (motor) neurones, as 
in the nerves to and from the spinal cord. The spinal 
cord is the grand trunk cable. Each of the complex 
structures known as basal ganglia, or lower segments 
of the brain, are bundles of neurones grouped in organ- 
ized masses. The cortex (a thin layer of the surface 
of the forebrain) is made up of the cell bodies that have 
the highest function and is generally regarded as the 
organ of consciousness. The inside of the hemispheres 
is composed essentially of masses of axones (1) connect- 
ing the cortex with the periphery (projection fibers), 
(2) connecting each point in one hemisphere with the 
corresponding point in the other hemisphere (commis- 
sural fibers), (3) connecting each part of the cortex of 
one hemisphere with every other part of the cortex on 
the same side (association fibers). 
Localization of functions. Each part of the ner- 
vous system has its particular task or function. We 
have seen in the case of the frog what can be done with 
a spinal cord alone, and have noted that, for each higher 
segment in the central nervous system, more and more 
complicated processes are taken on. Each part of the
-P-A-G-E-193
  NEURAL THEORY 175 
cortex of the cerebral hemispheres has its specific func- 
tion; large regions are devoted to the motor connec- 
tions and other regions are devoted to the sensory and 
the central processes respectively. Each of these is 
subdivided again and again. (See Appendix, Figs. 26 
and 27.) d 
We can understand the general conception of local- 
ization if we think of the cortex as a switchboard, such 
as we find in a telephone exchange, in which every sub- 
scriber has a connection. Localization of function is, 
therefore, in physiological terms, merely the indicating 
of the locations of incoming and outgoing connections in 
the cortex. We do not locate mental processes. When 
we say, for example, that a certain area of the brain con- 
tains the visual center, we do not thereby locate sen- 
sations of color or space, but simply indicate in purely 
physical terms what part of the cortex is connected with 
the eye in such a way that if we are to see color 
and space the nerve impulse must pass through this 
part. 
The nerve impulse. — The function of the neurone 
is to generate, discharge, and conduct nervous energy. 
The current that is generated and distributed by the 
neurone is known as a nerve impulse. The exact nature 
of the nerve impulse is not known, but, as in the case 
of electricity, we know something of its purpose, the laws 
of its generation and flow, and the results of its action. 
In the psychophysical organism, the nerve impulse 
serves purposes allied to those of the electric current 
in our telephone, lighting, and power machinery. It 
is generated in the cell body. When work is done in 
   
-P-A-G-E-194
  176 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
the cell body, the nucleus ‘‘runs down.” The cell has 
the power of self-charging.' 
The speed of the nerve impulse in a nerve trunk is about 
one hundred meters per second: but, in passing from 
one neurone to another in a chain, it is much retarded. 
It flows in certain paths set by the organization of the 
neurone chain ; but most paths are adaptable and change 
with new demands, and accumulating uses. The courses 
of nerve impulses have a complexity of organization 
adequate to account for the enormous complexity of 
both conscious and unconscious life. 
The current that flows through a storage battery is 
a steady current, said to be direct; but, for lighting 
and power purpose, we ordinarily use an alternating 
current, z.e., intermittent current, because it is more 
economical. This device of modern electricity is an imi- 
tation of nature’s plan in the nerve impulse. In all 
muscular action, the movement is caused by the dis- 
charge of the nerve impulse from motor neurones into 
the muscular fiber. This discharge is not a steady flow 
but consists of pulsations or shocks, at the minimum rate 
that will secure steady action in the muscles. 
This was illustrated in the tetanus or rigidity of the 
frog. The same might be illustrated even with a single 
nerve and muscle. The rate varies with the muscle 
that is to be sustained. If you hold your arm out 
straight and firm and apply a delicate hearing device, 
you may hear a faint tone of about forty vibrations 
1 “Nerve cells, like all other cells, lead individual lives, — they breathe, they 
assimilate, they dispense their own stores of energy, they repair their own sub- 
stance waste; each is, in short, a living unit with its nutrition more or less cen- 
tered in itself.” (Sherrington)
-P-A-G-E-195
  NEURAL THEORY 177 
per second, and the same may also be observed by elec- 
trical devices. This means that your arm is kept in 
steady suspense by a nerve impulse discharging at the 
rate of about forty impulses per second. This is the 
principle upon which all control of muscles rests; and, 
with some modification, it probably applies also to the 
central processes associated with consciousness. 
Nature has anticipated electric devices in another 
way. Transoceanic telegraphy was made possible by 
the introduction of relay stations. This is the principle 
upon which the nerve impulse is transmitted through 
chains of neurones, even hundreds of thousands of links. 
Each neurone is an independent battery and all after 
the first in the chain may be regarded as relays. Each 
neurone in the chain does not merely transmit the cur- 
rent as a conductor, but the incoming impulse acts as 
a stimulus and each neurone in the relay in turn gene- 
rates its own current. This accounts for the fact also 
that the nerve impulses originating in a single neurone 
may radiate out of thousands of associated paths, and 
each line of the divided impulse may maintain an ade- 
quate force. 
Fatigue and age.— When a door bell battery runs 
down, it is not the clapper of the bell, nor the copper 
wire that is exhausted; it is the working chemical ele- 
ments in the cell. So, in muscular fatigue, it is not the 
muscle, nor is it the nerve that is fatigued ; it is the work- 
ing part of the neurone that is depleted from the dis- 
charge of nerve impulses. The same principle holds for 
all kinds of physical as well as mental fatigue. The 
physical character of the effect of fatigue is Shown in

fatigue except that the cell gradually loses the power of 
restoration. The characteristic €ondition of -extreme 
age is shown in Fig. 19, in which 1 shows the cells from 
a young infant and 2 the corresponding cells from a man 
who died of old age. Many diseases affecting the ner- 
vous system take the same form of deterioration as in 
fatigue or age. 
The reflex arc. — The elemental unit of action in ani- 
mals that have a nervous system is called the reflex arc. 
In its typical 
simple form,

effect. Hence, we find the three elements of the arc: 
receptors in the form of sensory neurones in the sense 
organs, corfductors in the form of nerve fibers and in- 
termediate neurones, and effectors in the form of muscle 
tissue, into which the nerve impulse discharges and 
causes the response. The reflex arc must have at least 
two neurones, a sensory and a motor; but the typical 
arc has at least three, the third being a central neurone 
between the afferent and efferent. A reflex of this type 
taken by itself is said to be simple. Like pure sensa- 
tion, the simple reflex is perhaps normally an abstrac- 
tion, because the act can scarcely take place without 
     
-P-A-G-E-198
180 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
disturbing associated neurones; yet it furnishes a true 
and serviceable concept for neural theory. From the 
simple arc we may trace a gradual development of 
coédrdination and compounding of these reflexes into 
more and more complicated patterns, even such as cor- 
respond to the most complicated neural processes. 
The synapse. — The neurones, which are capable of 
being joined into circuits, are not grown together. Con- 
nections are made through mere contiguity or contact. 
The point in which two neurones come into contact 
may be thought of as a bridgeable gap, and is called 
a synapse.’ This form of free connection is a won- 
derful provision for plasticity; i.e., possibility of form- 
ing new and varied connections by the raising or lower- 
ing of the resistance at any synapse for the purpose of 
opening or closing the circuit. If they were grown to- 
gether, only fixed courses would be possible and, there- 
fore, no learning could take place. In terms of the 
change in resistance at the synapse, we explain the 
plasticity in neural association; and, in terms of neural 
association, we explain the physical basis of mental 
processes. « 
Some characteristics of neural action at the synapse. — 
The exact nature of the mechanism of the synapse 
is not fully known. In general the nerve impulse be- 
haves in the neural arc like an electric current in its 
circuit: it flows only in one direction, and takes the 
course of least resistance. A nerve trunk will carry 
the nerve impulse in either direction; but the synapse 
will transmit it in only one direction — from axon of 
one neurone to dendrite of another. By variation in
-P-A-G-E-199
  NEURAL THEORY 181 
the resistance between adjacent neurones, a practically 
infinite number of “ circuits,”* “ paths,” “ neural 
patterns,” or “neural arcs’? may be formed. In passing 
through the synapse, the resistance encountered re- 
duces the speed at this point, sometimes very greatly. 
There may be a summation effect: weak stimuli, any one 
of which would be too weak to overcome the resistance 
of the synapse by itself, may force the impulse through 
by repetition. There is a refractory phase in some re- 
flexes; i.e., under constant stimulation the synapse 
becomes resistant for a moment after the initial current. 
This results in the periodical movement in many re- 
flexes, as in the scratching reflex. In this principle we 
shall probably find an explanation of the periodicity 
in many of the rhythms in mental life. 
The final common path. — Sherrington calls the mo- 
tor neurone in the reflex arc the “ final common path,” 
to indicate that the neurones which innervate a given 
muscle fiber furnish the only path to that effector. This 
effector may be energized from countless sources of 
irritation in the complex nervous system: but, to be 
effective through this particular effector, the nerve im- 
pulses must always switch in on this final common path. 
Thus, in the reflex frog, the right foot is used for wiping 
off all acid irritation within reach on the right side of 
the body; therefore, wherever they originate, the nerve 
impulses that innervate the right hind foot must dis- 
charge through some of the final common paths that lead 
to that foot. This conception is important for our 
purpose because, in the coérdination and compound- 
ing of reflexes, the result must be interpreted in terms
-P-A-G-E-200
  182 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
of control of the final common path. We have here 
a concrete situation in which to interpret codperation 
and opposition; 7.e., facilitation and inhibition of 
nerve impulses. The point is that arcs from all parts 
of the nervous system use the same muscles. A particu- 
lar muscle fiber may respond to a simple sensory stim- 
ulus, or to a most complicated conscious and voluntary 
act; but, it can never be reached except through the 
“final common path,” the motor neurone leading to 
that fiber. 
The afferent arc. — Like the final common path, the 
afferent neurone also furnishes a common channel 
through which nerve impulses may discharge into count- 
less other channels. The nerve impulse from a prick 
of a needle on the tip of the finger may set up only the 
simple reflex which results in the withdrawal of that 
part of the finger; but it may radiate and discharge 
into practically every muscle of the body if the pain is 
intense. Yet the impulse was conveyed over a single 
afferent arc to the spinal cord. 
The central neurones. — The whole mechanism for 
the switching, the diffusion, the complication, and the 
concentration of nerve impulses, therefore, lies in the 
system of central neurones. These constitute the bulk 
of the central nervous system. In the simplest case, a 
single central neurone lies between the afferent and effer- 
ent neurones in the spinal cord. In the most complex 
case, the nerve impulse may have to thread its way in 
divergent paths through millions of neurones in the spinal 
cord, the basal ganglia, and the cerebral hemispheres. 
No nerve impulse is without effect. A stimulated neu-
-P-A-G-E-201
  NEURAL THEORY 183 
rone discharges its impulse into an effector or into an- 
other neurone which in time passes it on. The main 
interest to psychology here lies in the fact that, between 
the afferent arc and the final common path lies the bulk 
of the central nervous system so organized as to fur- 
nish an adequate organ of consciousness and mechanism 
for countless automatic coérdinations. 
The laws of association in terms of resistance. — 
Since the nerve impulse follows the line of least resist- 
ance, the path of any netve impulse may be shifted 
from circuit to circuit by varying the resistance at stra- 
tegic points. The means for such variation of the resist- 
ance we have found in the mechanism of the synapse, 
the point at which connections are made. 
The resistance of a given path is lessened by use; 
other things being equal, the more frequently a nerve 
impulse has followed a particular circuit the less resist- 
ance it will offer and the more readily it will be followed 
thereafter: this is the law of repetition or frequency. 
It is the law of_habit and instinctf Other things being 
equal, the stimulus of a given character having once 
established a circuit, this path offers less resistance and 
will be followed thereafter: this is the law of primacy. 
Other things being equal, the circuit last followed 
leaves the path freest from resistance. This is the law 
of recency. Other things being equal, the circuit taken 
by the strongest impulse will offer the least resistance: 
this is the law of intensity. Other things being equal, 
the course followed in an agreeable experience offers 
less resistance: this is one of the aspects of the law of 
emotional congruity.
-P-A-G-E-202
  184 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
Thus, our laws of association are conceived, stated, 
and explained in terms of purely physical principles 
governing the transmission of nerve impulses through 
the mechanism of varying the resistance at the synapses. ! 
Central complication of reflexes. — Combination of 
reflexes may be simultaneous or successive, allied or 
antagonistic. The exciting of the wiping reflex in the 
frog from adjacent areas simultaneously would be an 
example of simultaneous allied reflexes: they codperate 
effectively to the extent that they have a common task. 
Walking is an example of successive reflexes: each 
step excites a complex system of receptors which in turn 
discharge into the appropriate effector for the next step. 
When two reflexes in command of the same effector are 
opposed, as when one reflex moves a limb forward and 
the other backward, they are said to be antagonistic. 
Here the principle of interference plays an important 
role. It is the function of some arcs to inhibit action. 
The muscular system is normally under constant tension : 
with every energizing for a movement is associated an 
inhibition or release of antagonistic movements. There 
must be a balancing of forces. 
Considering the profuse supply of afferent arcs from 
all parts of the body, the presence of common paths 
to every muscle, and the existence of millions and mil- 
lions of central neurones organized for synaptic func- 
tional relation in the forming of central paths, we find 
in this principle of the complex neural arc a mechanism 
1 Sherrington points out four general features that tend to determine the 
sequence or dominance in competing reflexes; namely, spinal induction, relative 
intensity of the stimulus, relative fatigue, and the functional species of the re- 
flex. These are taken for granted in the above statement of the laws of asso- 
ciation and are covered by the proviso ‘other things being equal.”
-P-A-G-E-203
NEURAL THEORY 185 
adequate to form a neural basis for all that man can know, 
feel, or do. Modern psychology maintains that there 
is a physical correlate for every mental process — not 
only in sensation and action, but equally in the higher, 
more complicated and more abstract processes, such as 
memory, imagination, thought, emotion, and sentiment. 
And the fundamental principle of this neural organi- 
zation is the law of association, as operating in the central 
neurones. From the physiological point of view this 
may be regarded as an extension of the principle of the 
reflex arc. 
The human nervous system is a‘microcosm (a small 
organism) as the stellar heavens are a macrocosm (a 
large organism). Each of the thousands of millions 
of neurones in the nervous system of man is an organism 
complete in itself with the power of generating, storing, 
and transmitting energy. Each neurone is made up of 
millions of molecules, and each molecule, the physicist 
tells us, is as complex as the modern man-of-war. The 
spaces between the atoms of molecules have been lik- 
ened to the distances between the heavenly bodies in 
our solar system. In this microcosm, as in the stellar 
macrocosm, we believe that not an atom moves except 
in accordance with natural law. 
Organization vs. mechanization. — We have attempted 
to convey, as far as possible in high lights, a concep- 
tion of the nervous system as a living organism built 
and working at every stage on natural principles. Every 
presentation of this sort is misleading in that it is sketchy 
and assertive and does not convey any adequate 
conception of the infinite intricacy of organization and

  186 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
richness of relationships, and is couched in our very 
superficial and fragmentary concepts of what natural 
processes really are. In short, it offers too simple an 
explanation. We should, therefore, perhaps safely urge 
that the conception presented be regarded as figurative 
and skeletal rather than exact and detailed. Among 
the convictions that the psychologist gets more and more 
deeply impressed as he studies any mental process are 
the unfathomableness and profundity of the organiza- 
tion of nature and the limited means of interpretation 
and description now at our command.! 
1“ Often our powers of prevision are balked. It is true that where we are 
dealing with repetitive routine, little more is required than a skilled application 
of our powers of calculation. But in the evolution which supersedes routine we 
have again and again to confess that we cannot foretell how the world-story 
will work out in the future. This, however, I contend is not because the in- 
herent development of the story will be lacking in logical coherence; it is be- 
cause our imperfect insight and reason fail to grasp the determining factors 
within the deeper logic of the universe.” (Lloyd Morgan)

  CHAPTER XIV 
MIND AND BODY 
In the present chapter we shall merely touch briefly 
upon four general aspects of thestudy of mental life: 
the general traits of consciousness, the nature of the sub- 
conscious, behavior, and the psychophysical theory. 
CONSCIOUSNESS 
Consciousness is the characteristically mental aspect 
of life. Psychologists frequently use the terms “ con- 
sciousness ”’ and “ experience ”’ interchangeably. With- 
out attempting to define the obvious and immediate, 
we may say that by consciousness, or experience, we or- 
dinarily mean some form of awareness; as, for example, 
in seeing or hearing, remembering or imagining, think- 
ing or feeling. Indeed, consciousness as a continuous 
process may be regarded as the sum total of such mental 
processes functionally integrated from moment to mo- 
ment.! 
“Four characters in consciousness.” — Under this 
head James points out four fundamental traits of con- 
sciousness in general, which anyone can readily ob- 
serve; namely, (r) every mental state tends to be a part 
1“Consciousness is the ability of an organism to decide upon a course of 
action at this present time, such as will secure that organism’s welfare at some 
future time.” ‘This definition, given to the author informally by Ritter, is a 
good example of the functional definition of consciousness now in vogue in 
biology. 
187
-P-A-G-E-206
  188 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
of a personal consciousness; (2) within each personal 
consciousness the states are always changing; (3) each 
personal consciousness is sensibly continuous; (4) con- 
sciousness is always interested more in one part of its 
object than another, and welcomes, rejects, or chooses 
all the while it thinks. 
Exercise. — Think intently for one minute, repeatedly, on the 
problem, “The effect on human life of the introduction of the auto- 
mobile,” and write out, from your introspections, a series of illus- 
trations to substantiate the claim that your consciousness in this 
act was (1) personal, (2) always changing, (3) sensibly continuous, 
and (4) selective. Use only original observations from this act of 
introspection. 
(1) Personal.—If{ you should compare notes with 
another student, you would probably be impressed with 
the fact that, while you were aware of a number of the 
same facts, each of the items in your stream of conscious- 
ness had some personal relation to yourself. No matter 
how similar, they could not be shared or duplicated. 
Each thought was exclusively your own, even though 
you may have accepted the cue from some one else. 
For each time that you repeated the introspection, you 
became more and more convinced that the illustrations 
brought out had some relation to your own personal 
life and that the picture in your mind was characteristic 
of yourself — a projection of your personal experience, 
interests, range of information, logical power, ambitions, 
possessions, ideals, capacities, and aptitudes. You 
shared with no one an exact image of any automobile, 
process of reasoning, or feeling of the value that you 
attributed to the coming in of the automobile. You ex-
-P-A-G-E-207
MIND AND BODY 189 
perienced a personal feeling of self-exertion, warmth, and 
exclusiveness, and a feeling of personal limitations, or a 
power of grasp of the situation which was peculiarly your 
own. You felt yourself single-handed in a personal en- 
counter with a problem. 
(2) Changing. — Not only did the entire mass of your 
“stream of thought ” move on for every fraction of a 
second under observation, but there was a constant flux 
in internal arrangement and a constant “ turnover,” 
new elements continually rushing in and present elements 
rapidly being sloughed-off For each minute that you 
repeated the same task, your experience was radically 
different; you could not, in any sense, repeat the 
thought. Even concrete facts which you used as a 
basis of argument appeared to you each time.in differ- 
ent setting and different meaning. No state of con- 
sciousness recurred in successive trials without profound 
change. As a person, you felt yourself at the mercy 
of this “fleeting show ” of the mass of flashes of con- 
sciousness. You realized that there was no possible 
moment of repose in a fixed state of consciousness. 
You caught yourself irresistibly acting. You beheld, 
during these moments of observation, a good example 
of the “ flow ” of consciousness. 
(3) Continuous. — Yet, in all this array of fleeting, 
personal encounters, you had a feeling of continuity. 
Each image or idea followed in turn upon the preceding 
in accordance with the laws of association. You thought 
of yourself as a permanent subject of these experiences, 
although you were aware of gaps, lapses, and moments 
of helplessness. Yet, these very awarenesses of inter-
-P-A-G-E-208
  190 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
ruption and incoherence stressed your feeling that the 
observed fragments belonged together and were a part of 
your continuous consciousness. Indeed, you observed no 
“parts’’; at every stage you observed aspects of the 
functioning of a continuous organism. With progressive 
training in introspection, you will acquire greater power 
to observe relationships in consciousness and realize that 
in this feeling of the continuity of the stream of thought 
lies the foundation for your awareness of yourself as a 
personality. 
(4) Selective. —In the above introspection you were 
much impressed with the responsibility for selecting 
point of view, values, examples, conclusions. Numer- 
ous wide vistas of possibilities lay open before you, and 
the initiative that you exercised consisted largely in the 
selection of your course from those which spontaneously 
came into the foreground in accordance with the laws 
of association. Your entire organism was selective. 
Your attention focused on the outcome of an exceedingly 
small portion of the consciousness before you at a given 
moment. The thinking you did under these conditions 
was limited by the limit of your natural capacities, senses, 
training, habits, and interests. In other words, you 
found yourself in various ways determining the turn of 
events in consciousness. When you analyze this self- 
activity, you will find that it can best be expressed in 
the idea that your consciousness itself — what you are — 
selected the objects of interest, attention, and significance 
on the ground of its own character. 
Focal and marginal consciousness. — In the study of 
discrete processes, such as sensations, images, associa-
-P-A-G-E-209
  MIND AND BODY 19 
tions, and ideas, there is danger of gaining the concep- 
tion that consciousness is made up of isolated units of 
this kind, in a sort of molecular structure. There has 
been a tendency in all ages toward a mechanistic in- 
terpretation of consciousness in terms of so-called el- 
ements. To offset this, we must think of conscious- 
ness as an organism, with all its parts functionally 
interrelated, blending, fusing, and working together. 
Perhaps we can illustrate in the case of a good pic- 
ture of a landscape: here in the foreground is a.herds- 
man, a flock of sheep of which a few stand out in 
clear features, a tree, a few shrubs; in the distance lie 
stretches of timber, meadows, a field, a river, and sky, 
dotted here and there with suggestions of houses, herds, 
birds, and clouds. That is the landscape, the picture 
we can grasp in a moment of consciousness; and this 
is typical of the content of consciousness at all times: 
there are one or more significant things in the clear fore- 
ground which catch our attention and, receding out from 
these, lie related objects, events, and situations, fading 
off indefinitely into the remote distance. As attention 
moves from one object to another in the foreground, the 
massive background changes less and thus furnishes a 
setting, a bond of continuity in the experience of succes- 
sive objects in the foreground. The objects which gain 
attention are few in comparison with the masses of re- 
lated objects in the setting; yet the remote objects, even 
though faintly suggested in their part of the picture as a 
whole, give tone to the foreground.! 
1 To apply this illustration, think for just a moment of your home. Perhaps 
in this picture the house was in the foreground and the camera of your con- 
sciousness, as it were, snapped in rapid succession a tree, a man, a shrub, and so
-P-A-G-E-210
  192 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
It has been customary to show the relation of the focus 
to the margin by a series of concentric circles in which the 
innermost, small circle represents focal consciousness, 
and succeeding circles outward represent the more and 
more receding background of consciousness. The nature 
of this extreme, marginal consciousness we shall consider 
ina moment. Let us here merely note that only an in- 
finitesimally small part of the stream of consciousness is 
clearly focal, and that the vast mass of mental processes 
surge in the marginal background, receding gradually 
beyond the dim horizon. Herein lies the explanation of 
the ‘sensible continuity ” of consciousness which you 
observed in the exercise. The focus of consciousness 
flits from object to object in the foreground, but the 
sensible bond lies largely in the array of related processes 
in the more or less remote background. 
THE SUBCONSCIOUS 
Difficulties encountered. — One of the most debat- 
able issues in psychology pertains to the nature of this 
receding, marginal consciousness and what lies beyond, 
usually spoken of as the subconscious or unconscious. 
The idea of the subconscious has been a term to conjure 
with on the part of all kinds of mystery mongers in al- 
leged psychology. For this there are several reasons. 
It is a field which has not yet been organized by system- 
atic experiments in the laboratory, and, therefore, its 
full significance has not been grasped and it has not 
been adequately formulated in scientific psychology. 
on, and each of these carried in the background certain common elements char- 
acteristic of the home environment and in the same way tied up with your early 
life. 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
    MIND AND BODY 193 
It is not readily approached through direct introspec- 
tion. It manifests itself most conspicuously in abnormal 
and pathological cases. It is by its very nature mysteri- 
ous in that it often seems to function as a consciousness 
outside of the personal consciousness. In legitimate 
psychology it has furnished a most satisfactory explana- 
tion of the strange, the weird, and the apparently super- 
normal, as in hypnosis, alternating personality, and all 
forms of automatisms and is, therefore, resorted to by 
the ignorant and uncritical as a cover for anything which 
is mysterious to them. This, in turn, has made it an 
easy victim for identification with all sorts of uncritical, 
semi-religious, pseudo-philosophical and quasi-scientific 
theories as to its ultimate nature. 
Theories of the subconscious. — Among the aspects 
of theories presented critically by psychologists, but which 
seem to be passing, we may note the following: (1) Ac- 
cording to the theory of “ unconscious cerebration ” 
all that is not conscious is denied the appearance of 
mentality and the facts are interpreted entirely in terms 
of neural activity. Miinsterberg’s voluminous writings 
on the subconscious from this point of view are summed 
up in the declaration, ‘‘ There is no subconscious.”’ All 
that is below the strictly conscious is regarded as purely 
physiological activity. The term consciousness is, how- 
ever, used in a broad sense, e.g., so as to include dream 
consciousness and many other phenomena usually classi- 
fied as subconscious. (2) The so-called “ storehouse ” 
theory regards the subconscious as a vast mental store- 
house in which each mental experience, such as sensa- 
tions, memories, and ideas, are stored away as mental
-P-A-G-E-212
  
104 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
states which may be withdrawn from storage under cer- 
tain circumstances. (3) The “ subliminal self” theory 
injects a metaphysical doctrine in regard to the reality, 
dignity, and function of this so-called subliminal self 
which throws the waking consciousness into a compara- 
tively subordinate position. It regards this subliminal 
self as the source and foundation of the true self and 
carries a number of assumptions in regard to immor- 
tality and other transcendent characteristics of this self. 
Present use of the term. — There is great diversity 
of opinion among psychologists on this subject, but, 
throughout this book, we are proceeding on the theory 
that the subconscious represents those processes which 
are outside of the focus of our attention to processes as 
related to the waking self. We regard the subconscious 
as an extension of consciousness, the distinction between 
conscious and subconscious being merely that we call 
those mental processes ‘“‘ conscious ” which we are aware 
of experiencing at the time of the experience in the waking 
state, and all other mental phenomena subconscious. 
- As in the illustration of the landscape above, there is no 
sharp line between the focal region in which distinct 
features or objects are observed in turn and the vast 
region beyond this in which features are massed. 
The term ‘“‘subconscious”’ seems to involve a contradic- 
tion. There is a tendency to identify conscious and 
mental; the subconscious would, therefore, imply some- 
thing under the mental, not mental. This difficulty, 
however, rests mainly upon a poverty in words. Ac- 
cording to our view, the subconscious is mental and it is 
of the same kind as the conscious, the mental being di-
-P-A-G-E-213
  MIND AND BODY 1@6 
vided into the conscious and the subconscious. It is 
merely remote in a part of the waking system of self- 
awareness. The subconscious may be clear, discrimin- 
ating, and organized around a remote personal nucleus, 
just as the conscious is. In the analogy of the painting, 
one’s observation may center about any feature, how- 
ever trifling, to such an extent as to result in utter obliv- 
iousness to both self and painting as such. Our theory 
denies the assumption that ideas and impressions are 
stored, as implied in one group of theories; it disavows 
any metaphysical assumption in regard to the subliminal 
as a form of ultimate reality; it takes a broader view 
than the theory which regards the subconscious as a 
split-off fragment; it recognizes the adequacy of the 
physiological account of all neural processes underlying 
mentality; it recognizes the vastness of the subcon- 
scious element associated with our ordinary conscious 
life; it draws no sharp lines between the conscious and 
the subconscious; and does not attempt to determine 
the limit of mentality. 
Some concept like this is indispensable to the full 
account of any mental process as it represents the bulk 
of our whole stream of mental life. From this point of 
view we may represent in the triangle of Fig. 20 a cross 
section of ordinary processes at a given moment. At 
the apex of this triangle, a very small section, shaded 
black, designates the corresponding conscious field; and 
below that, the subconscious, gradually fading out into 
the unconscious region of neural processes not associated 
with mentality. The figure should impress two facts: 
first, the correlation of the physical and mental down to 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
  1,06 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
some yet undetermined limit below the level of waking, 
self-relating consciousness; and second, the relatively 
small scope of the focal consciousness as compared with 
the subconscious and the unconscious. 
Provided we bear in mind that all three levels are a 
part of the same living organism, and that whatever 
occurs at any level 
modifies the whole 
cross section, it 
would be quite pos- 
sible, in a figure of 
this kind, to sug- 
gest an infinitenum- 
ber of courses in the 
process from im- 
pression _ through 
elaboration to ex- 
<\ pression in mental 
  bps ne *. and neural activity, 
é \ showing that a pro- 
Fic. 20. cess may be ini- 
tiated at the conscious, subconscious, or purely neural 
level, and may be both elaborated and expressed at any 
of these levels. 
BEHAVIOR 
There are two fundamental approaches to the study 
of mental life. One is introspection, of which we have 
abundant examples in the preceding chapters; the other 
is behaviorism of which we have also had a number of ex- 
amples. In the former, we approach the study from
-P-A-G-E-215
  MIND AND BODY 197 
the point of view of conscious experience as, for ex- 
ample, in the study of color effects, or in the preceding 
observations on the characteristics of consciousness. In 
the latter, we proceed entirely on the basis of control 
and registering of physical stimuli and movements. 
Both introspection and behaviorism may be conducted 
in various degrees of exactness and control ranging from 
loose, random observation to rigidly controlled condi- 
tions of experiment. Most of the laboratory work done 
in psychology combines the two methods. i 
Tn the extreme attitude of behaviorism we entirely dis- 
regard the testimony of consciousness and simply record 
objective stimuli and the reactions thereto. This method 
is particularly advantageous in the study of lower or- 
ganisms ; as, for example, in observing reactions to light, 
temperature, contact, and the various chemical stimuli. 
The method may, however, be extended into the study 
of the higher mental processes both in man and animals, 
as, for example, in measuring ability to sense, discrim- 
inate, remember, learn, and even to think or act under 
the influence of feeling and emotion. But behaviorism 
ordinarily justifies itself by translating such observed 
facts into terms of experience. All experiment and meas- 
urement in psychology is based upon the assumption 
that the psychophysical organism is a unit. Man as 
a human being is therefore a creature that lives in ac- 
cordance with natural law. Nothing happens without 
a cause and every cause has its effect; and in most situ- 
ations in life it is possible to set conditions so that the 
effect will be expressed in bodily movement of some 
kind. 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
  198 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
The behavioristic method has the advantage of not 
stopping to differentiate what is mental and what is 
physical. Thus, in studying the learning process it does 
not consider what elements of the process are conscious, 
subconscious, or unconscious. It simply sets condi- 
tions and observes results; and in this manner it is quite 
possible to work out in finest detail the laws of learning, 
of forgetting, of concentration, of distraction, etc. In 
its pure form, the behavioristic method is physiological ; 
and the science which results from it is the science of be- 
havior, which may or not be interpreted in terms of ex- 
perience or consciousness. 
An example of the most natural use of this method may 
be seen in the study of behavior in the infant. During 
the early period of infancy we cannot get any direct re- 
port from the infant about its experience. Our obser- 
vations must all be expressed in terms of behavior as 
described by stimulus and response. But the domi- 
nant attitude in our technical laboratory experiments is 
essentially behavioristic. The same is true of mental 
tests. 
Experiment in animal psychology of necessity takes 
a behavioristic character. In the new behavioristic 
movement, experiments on animals are likely to be made 
for the purpose of discovering general biological princi- 
ples with particular reference to man. A rather ex- 
treme and quaint illustration of this type is given in the 
following footnote on ‘The Psychology of Monotony.”! 
1A behavioristic experiment: “‘The Psychology of Monotony.” — Pro- 
fessor Boldyreff in Russia has just published an experiment, making use of what 
is known as the salivary reflex. A dog is provided with a little capsule which 
collects the saliva as it is secreted by the salivary gland upon being fed.
-P-A-G-E-217
  MIND AND BODY 199 
Psychologists who are not behaviorists use the term 
“ behavior ” legitimately in a broader sense than that 
Experiment 1.— The dog was given a morsel of bread and at regular inter- 
vals this was repeated, the dog apparently relishing the food; and it was 
observed that for each feeding, four minutes apart, the secretion of saliva 
decreased both in quantity and quality. 
Experiment 2.—The dog was fed under the same conditions something 
injurious and_ irritable, and it was observed that for each successive feeding 
the flow of saliva tended to increase both in quantity and quality. 
Both experiments were repeated after a lapse of several days of time, and 
in each case it was found that the original condition had been restored. Hence 
we have three laws: (1) The repetition of a pleasant stimulus progressively 
loses in effectiveness of the responsiveness of the organism. (2) The repeti- 
tion of an unpleasant stimulus ingreases the responsiveness of the organism. 
(3) Prolonged rest from either of the above results in normal responsiveness of the 
organism. 
On these facts he has formulated the principle of habituation. After dis- 
cussing the physiological significance of this, he suggests certain psychological 
deductions and applications of the principle in the following quaint language 
of a foreigner writing English. The gist of these applications may be summarized _ 
as follows: (1) Sameness of food that we take daily injures digestion and there- 
fore nutrition. (2) Uniformity of certain conditions in the time of eating is in 
the same manner unwholesome. This injurious effect of monotony is overlooked 
by modern dietitians, as change is necessary for the normal appetite. (3) Mi- 
gration to remote lands with quite a difference in general and quite different 
products of food in particular enforces digestion and therefore favors nutrition. 
It consequently enforces the vitality of migrants. The advantage of traveling 
has its foundation chiefly in the alteration of diet and fashion of living. 
(4) First impressions are always strongest: first love, first success in work or 
play, first hunting, and the like, give to men the most joy and happiness; there- 
fore childhood, as the time most rich with first impressions, affords us much 
joyfulness. (5) A long interruption restores the vigor of pleasant impressions 
and weakens that of unpleasant ones. (6) Monotony of life lessens the inter- 
est of it and produces the feelfng of boredom. Therefore the monotony of life 
in institutions is unwholesome. (7) The curiosity of women depends upon the 
great monotony of their life in comparison with that of men. Curiosity of 
savages rests upon the same principle. (8) The feeling of curiosity — the love 
of knowledge —is the most important agent of intellectual progress for an 
individual and for mankind. (9) Human response may be divided into the useful 
(pleasant) and the injurious (unpleasant). During the life of every man, both 
are inevitably often repeated. The repetition of injurious reflexes strengthens 
their action and therefore in the course of life they become more and more inju- 
rious, excessive, and irritable. The frequent repetition of useful reflexes during 
life weakens more and more and therefore inevitably causes deterioration, both 
spiritual and bodily. This is one of the chief reasons for aging. (10) The 
tendency of women to adorn themselves and follow fashions is necessary for 
the lessening of the uniformity of life. (a1) The sum of pleasant sensations 
diminishes in the course of life. (12) Life in the tropics lessens the power of the 
human spirit because in all its richness it is more uniform than where there is

indicated above. McDougall, restricting behavior to 
the action or actions of some living thing, points out the 
following marks of behavior from a psychological point 
of view: (r) certain spontaneity of movement; (2) per- 
sistence of activity independently of the continuance of 
the impression which may have initiated it; (3) varia- 
tion of direction of persistent movements; (4) coming 
to an end of the animal’s movements as soon as they 
have brought about a particular kind of change in its 
situation ; (5) preparation for the new situation toward 
the production of which the action contributes ; (6) some 
degree of improvement in the effectiveness of behavior, 
when it is repeated by the animal under similar circum- 
stances; and (7) [purposive action is] a total reaction 
of the organism. 
PsyCHOPHYSICAL THEORY 
As to the relation of mind and body, we are con- 
fronted with three problems: (2) What is the ultimate 
nature of mind? (2) What theoretical assumption shall 
we make about the relation of mind and matter? 
(3) What are the observable facts about the relation of 
one to the other? 
a change of seasons. (13) Happiness to mankind will come more through the 
progress of science and culture than through the simplification of life. (14) There 
is also spiritual satiety. The taking of spiritual nourishment follows the same 
principle as the taking of physical nourishment. (15) “What for is sleep nec- 
essary?” It is necessary in order to provide interruption of the pleasant and 
recovery from the unpleasant. (16) Increasing of the force of unpleasant im- 
pressions is the cause of irascibility of old people. (17) Irascibility of a bed- 
ridden, sick person, a prisoner, or a chained dog is connected with the monotony 
of the conditions of their life. (18) The same reason explains the mutual irasci- 
bility of the inmates of small cabins. (19) This irritation can be so strengthened 
as to result in madness, (20) Repeated pains became in time more and more 
difficult to bear and can even killa man. The same is true of spiritual pains. 
1 “The sharp distinction between mind and body is a very ancient and spon-

  MIND AND BODY 201 
Nature of mind. — What is mind? This is the oldest 
and most persistent question in philosophy and psychol- 
ogy, even in the reflections of untutored and primitive 
man. On the answer given to that question rest large 
bodies of myths, cults, philosophies, theologies, religions, 
and systems of science as: well as peace of mind in the 
attitude of so-called common sense. The history of 
thought and civilization reveals thousands of theories 
of origins of spirit, kinds of spirits, and destinations 
of spirits, with the corresponding regulation of practical 
life. On the theory of mind as the ultimate reality, phi- 
losophers have built systems of interpretation of the world, 
and founded ethical standards of life. On the theory of 
mind as a functional phase of the psychophysical or- 
ganism, scientists are divided into camps, schools, or 
attitudes which hold such radically different views of the 
origin and function of mind as to color vividly their ac- 
count of observed facts in all the biological and regula- 
tive sciences, even in the practice of medicine. 
The question belongs to the realm of philosophy which 
is concerned with the ultimate nature of all things, such 
as mind, matter, knowledge, force, casualty, time, and 
space. The great thinker in each and every science 
inevitably comes to the philosophical approach of this 
issue in his mature thought. Fortunately, an answer 
taneous, uncritical, savage prepossession. What we think of as mind is so 
intimately concerned with what we call body that we are coming to realize that 
the one cannot be understood without the other. Every thought rever- 
berates through the body; and, on the other hand, alterations in our physical 
condition affect our whole attitude of mind. There are hidden impulses and 
desires and secret longings of which we can only with the greatest difficulty 
take account. They influence our conscious thought i1 the most bewildering 
fashion.” (Robinson, Mind in the Making.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  202 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
to this first question is not essential to the science of 
psychology, tantalizing though the craving for a solu- 
tion may be. 
The situation is exactly the same in mental science 
as in material science. No physicist knows what matter 
is; yet the question as to the nature of matter is as per- 
sistent and fundamental as the question about the na- 
ture of mind. In scientific psychology we pass over 
this question in the same way as, for example, in elec- 
tricity. No electrician knows, in the final analysis, what 
electricity is, yet he knows many of its laws, its relation 
to light and heat, how to produce it, how to use it, how 
to describe it, and how to control it. Exactly so it is in 
the case of mental life, except that the phenomena are 
vastly more complex, and in many respects less tangible. 
Philosophy, to-day, presents plausible answers to this 
question ; but for a scientific psychology, there is nothing 
gained by a mere naming or statement of such answers, 
because to understand anything philosophically, it is 
first necessary to think yourself into the situation through 
persistent training and discipline in philosophical think- 
ing. 
Relation of mind and body. — The second question 
is also primarily a philosophical one, though partly also 
scientific; but here the practical situation is different. 
In order to make any coherent and systematic descrip- 
tion and explanation of mental life from a scientific 
point of view, it is necessary to proceed upon the assump- 
tion of some type of answer to this question. A theory 
of psychophysical relation is an essential prerequisite 
of scientific psychology. The observed facts may be re-
-P-A-G-E-221
  MIND AND BODY 203 
ported fairly faithfully from the point of view of differ- 
ent theories; but any coherent account that is made 
will at once reveal an underlying theory. 
Current theories may be divided into two classes, the 
dualistic and the monistic. Dualism attributes real ex- 
istence to both matter and mind, and has generally taken 
one of two forms — interactionism or parallelism. Ac- 
cording to interactionism, body and mind. stand in 
causal relations, so that each may act upon the other; 
according to parallelism, mind cannot act upon body or 
body upon mind, but the two kinds of action run paral- 
lel. \Monism attributes reality to only one object of ex- 
perience. Idéalism maintains that this one reality is 
mind; materialism, that it is matter; and the double 
aspect theory that mind and matter are merely two as- ° 
pects of the one more fundamental reality. 
You will observe that the double aspect theory best 
fits our view in this book. It denies the causal relation 
implied in the interaction theories, and recognizes the 
observed facts of parallelism, but denies the duality of 
mind and body usually implied therein, and asserts that 
the mental and neural are two aspects of the same life 
process. Until recently, those who have held this view 
have classified themselves as parallelists; as, for ex- 
ample, Titchener, whose view is that “ consciousness 
and neural activity are simply two aspects of the same ex- 
perience.” This double aspect theory has been most 
recently stated by Warren : 
“The Double-Aspect interpretation differs from both 
Interactionism and Parallelism in assuming that con- 
scious and neural phenomena constitute one single series
-P-A-G-E-222
  204 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
of events, and that their different appearance is merely 
due to different ways of observing them. When they 
“happen to me’ they appear as conscious experiences ; 
when I observe them indirectly, through perceiving the 
behavior of other beings by means of my senses, they 
appear in the form of motion, chemical change, and the 
like. 
“According to this hypothesis, consciousness ‘ be- 
longs to ’ the activity of neurones as truly as the intensity 
or form of neural impulses belongs to this same activity. 
Just as in physics, when we discuss the properties of 
masses we find correlated phenomena, such as surface 
relations, which may or may not be studied but belong 
to the same group of phenomena, so in biology when we 
examine the properties of nerve substance we observe cer- 
tain correlated phenomena called conscious experiences. 
They form part of the ‘total description’ of nerve ac- 
tivity. In physics the same event or group of events 
may be studied through several different manifestations : 
we observe increase in heat through rise of mercury in 
a bulb or through the fusing of some metal. Neural 
events, according to the Double-Aspect hypothesis, are 
likewise observable either as behavior or as ‘our own’ 
experiences. 
“The Double-Aspect hypothesis is adopted here 
because it does not clash with observed facts and because 
it seems to provide the best working tool for psycho- 
logical investigation. It enables us to bring the results 
of objective and subjective observation into coéperation 
—using our physiological and behavior material to 
bridge the gaps in conscious experience, and using the 
results of self-observation to supply the missing data 
of brain activity.” (Human Psychology, pp. 415-416) 
Observable relationship. — The answer to our third 
question runs throughout the treatment of the entire 
subject of psychology. In sensory experience, we ob-
-P-A-G-E-223
MIND AND BODY 705 
served how sensation and perception were in every way 
correlated with corresponding sense organs and central 
neural activity. This principle, as applied to the higher 
mental processes, came to the foreground in our treat- 
ment of association and neural theory. The position 
taken there might be restated for every mental process 
that is discussed; but it will be readily seen that in the 
treatment of memory, imagination, feeling, emotion, 
impulse, and action, no new principle is introduced. 
The psychophysical relation recognized in the double 
aspect of association becomes an all-pervading principle 
of interpretation throughout all the higher mental pro- 
cesses.

“ Take the house cat and follow her through the life 
of a single day, observing her actions. She washes her 
face and makes her toilet in the morning by instinct. 
She has her peculiar instinctive way of catching the 
mouse for breakfast. She whets her appetite by holding 
back her meal possibly for an hour, in the meantime 
playing most cruelly with the pitiful mouse, letting it 
run and catching it again, and doing this over and over. 
If she has children she attends to their training in the 
details of cat etiquette and custom with the utmost 
care, all by instinct; and the kittens instinctively re- 
spond to her attentions. She conducts herself during 
the day with remarkable cleanliness of life, making ar- 
rangements which civilized man follows with admiration. 
She shows just the right abhorrence of water for a crea- 
ture that is not able to swim. She knows just what 
enemies to fly from and when to turn and fight, using 
with inborn dexterity her formidable claws. She prefers 
nocturnal excursions and sociabilities, having eyes which 
make it safe to be venturesome in, the dark. She has 
certain vocal expressions of her emotions vai man in 
vain attempts to eradicate with all the agenhciés of do-

EXERCISE. — @ On the model of the above illustration and tentative 
definition, describe as fully as you can the instinctive behavior of 
an infant, or of some animal with which you are thoroughly familiar. 
In reading this chapter, gather data that may be used as a 
basis for the comprehensive definition of instinct called for at the end 
of this chapter. 
There is at the present time no general agreement as to 
the nature of instinct. The conflict of theories is be- 
wildering, involving a mass of psychological, neurological, 
and biological controversies. Among crucial phases on 
which authors differ are the following: What is the re- 
lation between instinct and intelligence? What is the 
relation between instinct and reflexes? Are there any 
“instincts ’? Shall instincts be regarded as purely 
physical processes? Is instinct limited to action? Is 
instinct associated with the higher brain processes? 
In what respect does the theory of instinct replace the 
doctrine of innate ideas? What philosophy of mind and 
body shall we accept? What attitude shall be taken in 
the*current biological controversy between vitalism and 
mechanism ? 
It is not essential, not even desirable, to secure a final 
and complete concept of any subject like this. What we 
want is insight into the problem and a realization of its 
significance. To this end we may, perhaps, think our- 
selves into the situation by following critically the direct 
presentation of a theory which is consistent with the gen- 
eral point of view that runs through this book. ‘This 
theory may be stated progressively in terms of the lead- 
ing characteristics of instinctive behavior. 
Organized heritage. — Instinct is an inherited mode of 
behavior. It represents what survives of the progres- 
ot 
; — 
rs
-P-A-G-E-226
  208 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
sively organized habits of the species as a whole. With- 
out raising the question as to the method of inheriting 
acquired traits, we may assume that the common and 
persistent elements in the habits of our millions of pro- 
genitors are transmitted in the progressive organization 
of the nervous architecture of the species through evolu- 
tion from the humblest living organism to the highest 
—man. Therefore, instinctive behavior is determined 
by the organized reflex arcs which remain intact on the 
ground that they represent the well-worn racial paths. 
Reflex. — From the neural point of view instincts 
are reflexes, usually very complex, ranging from the 
simple reflexes.up to sublimations of reflexes in the most 
intricate higher brain patterns. The simple reflex 
stands to instinct in about the same relation as pure 
sensation to perception. Sensation is the elemental 
form of cognition. The reflex is the elemental form of 
the sensori-motor and associative processes as a whole. 
Mental. — Instinct is a mental concept which is em- 
ployed to denote the mental aspect of complex reflexes 
to the extent that mentality may be recognized in their 
operation. Neurologists tend to ignore this term and 
render their account purely in terms of reflexes. In 
this they are undoubtedly right in so far as they deal 
with the physical side only. All organization of neural 
processes may be conceived in terms of the reflex arc as 
a unit — even in the neural correlate of memory, senti- 
ment, and reason. But the acceptance of this does not 
prevent us from regarding memory, sentiment, and rea- 
son as mental processes and using them in our account of 
experience, which may be purely in mental terms. We
-P-A-G-E-227
  INSTINCT 209 
are just as certain that physical correlates exist for mem- 
ory as for instinct. 
This is a somewhat arbitrary way of settling the con- 
troversy about the relation of instinct to reflexes, but 
it is the logical outcome of the best tendencies in psy- 
chology at the present time. That is to say, we regard 
one as the physical, the other as the mental aspect of 
the same processes, in the sense that they are parallel. 
Within a certain limit, each one-sided description assumes 
the other. In this manner we shall use instinct to de- 
note a mental fact of which we recognize a specific physi- 
cal correlate, the reflex, just as we used memory and 
imagination to denote mental processes of which we 
recognized correlative neural aspects. 
Not conscious. — The pure instinct is not conscious © 
either as to the end served or as to the means of reach- 
ing it before the instinct has been expressed. Like the 
simple reflex, pure instinct rarely occurs, but the con- 
cept is true and convenient in the structural interpreta- 
tion of complex instincts. The pure instinct has es- 
sentially the same characteristics as the simple reflex: 
it is quick, specific, purposive, organized, and adequate. 
“Tt is not modified by considerations.”” To what extent 
instinct processes, which are not conscious, may be in- 
terpreted as subconscious is a matter of theory at the 
present time. We do not hesitate to employ a terminol- 
ogy which implies the existence of subconscious mental- 
ity; but at the present stage it is better not to dogmatize 
about the nature or the extent of such subconscious 
experience. 
Accompanied by consciousness. — The pure instinct, 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  210 # _ INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
may, however, be accompanied by consciousness. In 
response to the pin prick the unconscious reflex takes 
place before there is time for the consciousness of pain, 
yet the same nerve impulse that touched off the reflex 
may also radiate to the brain so that we may be clearly 
conscious of pain and modify the diffusion of the reflex 
in its later stage as a result of the pain. In the case of 
massive reflexes, such as fear, surprise, or flight, involv- 
ing the whole organism, there results a mass conscious- 
ness or feeling of undifferentiated impressions, their 
meanings, their expressions, and their conflicts. This we 
shall find later is the common source of emotion and is 
often spoken of as the instinct feeling or the instinct 
impulse. In other words, although the purely instinc- 
tive stage is entirely unconscious, the common instinc- 
tive acts run gradually into each and every one of the 
conscious forms of knowing, feeling, and action. 
Blends. — Instinctive processes are normally blended 
into habituated conscious and voluntary processes. The 
pure instinct being essentially a theoretical matter, our 
main interest lies in the instinctive blends or fusions in 
which instinct may be more or less a dominant factor. 
We recognize for instinct, then, the same flexibility of 
interpretation as we have recognized for the cognitive 
processes. For example, your eyes are cast upon the 
setting sun and you exclaim, “‘ What a beautiful sunset ! ” 
Your mental processes at the moment are sensations, 
perceptions, memories, images, thoughts, emotions, and 
responses — let us add, instinctive joy. No mental pro- 
cess is purely of one mental category. Even in the sim- 
plest situation the mental organism tends to respond as
-P-A-G-E-229
  INSTINCT 211 
a whole. This fact is fundamental for our conception 
of instinct or, as we may appropriately say, instinctive 
behavior. 
In all mental life. — Instinct is present in all mental 
life. It is not restricted to action as is commonly held 
nor is it restricted to the lower animal life. It enters 
into all knowing, feeling, and action of human as well 
as animal beings. You and I have instincts to do every- 
thing that we can do; to act in defense, to grasp in every 
sense of the word, to imagine, to feel, to think. The 
instinctive processes may be traced as a factor in all 
the degrees of intelligence, feeling and will, ranging 
from those processes in which it is dominant and ap- 
proaches purity, up to those complex processes in which 
we could recognize its presence only theoretically. That 
is to say, in actual experience instincts are not isolated 
unit acts, but the instinctive character is present to 
some extent as an ingredient in all mental life.! 
Instinctive, not  “instincts.’”— We must think of 
instinctive processes as opposed to instincts. The noun 
in the plural implies the existence of acts intact ; whereas 
the adjective recognizes the presence of instinctive 
traits in blends or complexes with other processes. The 
noun in the singular is used correctly in the same sense 
as the adjective. This becomes a matter of importance 
when the attempt is made to explain anything in terms 
of instinct. 
1“Suppose a bird were to become interested in zodlogical investigations; 
he might well regard man as the richest of all creatures in instinct. Man shares 
with the bird the instinct to live in wedlock; like the fox he educates his chil- 
dren; he has the beaver’s impulse to build houses, the bee’s custom of founding 
states and sending forth colonies; while he has in common with the ant a pleasure 
in war, in slave-making, and in domesticating useful animals.” (Wundt) 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  212 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
After the chick has pecked the first time, after the 
bird has launched on its first flight, after the infant has 
nursed for the first time, each has experience which, 
from that point on, progressively modifies the instinc- 
tive behavior by associating it with their experience. 
The instinctive tendencies to peck, to fly, and to suck 
persist not only in the specific acts in which they first 
occurred, but also in countless other acts, as we shall 
see later. The sucking instinct, for example, persists 
not only in all eating, but in the kiss, the smile; in the 
meaning of perception, imagination, memory; or in 
the thought of good things to eat, in the puckering 
of the lip, in the thrill at the beautiful sunset, in the 
realistic mental representation of anything regarded as 
“good for me.” 
Purposive. — Instinctive behavior is purposive. It 
consists of the organized responses which have served 
the purpose of the organism in the species. If the 
same acts were done as a result of will we should call 
them purposeful. No matter how far the instinctive 
tendencies have been spread and attenuated in the 
blend of adapted responses, the strain of what remains 
is always purposive. This does not deny the fact that 
many instincts fail in their purpose as, for example, 
the paralyzing situation in fear. This we explain by 
the fact that the same purpose may be accomplished 
by many and different means. For example, we may 
avoid danger by retreating or by driving danger away ; 
but the movements involved in the two cases are oppo- 
site; both are instinctive and each involves the prin- 
ciple of the reflex which may be regarded as rudimen-
-P-A-G-E-231
  
INSTINCT 213 
tary. The success of the instinctive responses should, 
therefore, be judged in terms of the conflict. 
Correlated with organs. — Every organ, every ef- 
fector in the animal organism, has its governing instinct. 
This is the condition of its emergence and survival. 
Animals that have claws scratch, horns hook, glands 
secrete the gland product, wings fly, eyes see, nostrils 
smell, developed forebrain think, feel, and will. This 
instinctive behavior is not limited to muscular action 
but includes sensory, cognitive, and affective aspects 
as well. The term organ is used here not only in the 
limited sense of a limb or a sense organ, but also in the 
broader sense of organization or integration of the nerv- 
ous system in part or as a whole. 
Organic memory. — Instinct is the exercise of racial 
organic memory. To the extent that it is not con- 
scious it can not consist of awareness of specific objects 
or events. It takes instead a simpler form of imme- 
diate expression in behavior. Thus, instinctive acts are 
memories at work — expressed. A very large part of 
life consists of such organic memories, pure and simple; 
but, from our point of view, organic memory enters 
to some extent into every complex form of mental life. 
We can understand feeling and knowing, even in their 
most complex and refined forms, only as we recognize 
in them the wonderful organizations of countless frag- 
ments of organic memory, each a faithful reporter of 
the past, struggling for expression in a melée of con- 
flicts. 
Organic memory takes the form of purposive re- 
sponses to stimuli, not only in the usual sense of a com-
-P-A-G-E-232
  214 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
plete stimulus response, but in a much more significant 
way through the countless partial responses that enter 
into feeling and knowing and action. We do not recall 
the wars, the struggles for existence, the roamings over 
the wild, the primitive independence of tools, the fears 
of animals; but we have deeply ingrained in our nature 
the tendency to respond in the way in which individuals 
of the race have responded. In anger, e.g., we display 
most of the activity involved in preparation for hand 
to hand conflict. 
Reversion to type.—It follows from the preceding that 
instinctive acts always exhibit a tendency toward re- 
version to type. To fight, to love, to hate, to solve a 
problem — to engage in any complex act instinctively 
—means that there is a tendency to strip the act of 
deliberation, variation, or consideration and perform it 
in the way it was performed in earlier racial life or 
earlier species. 
Modifiable. — Betting on instinct would be dull bet- 
ting, it has been said, because there is no chance about 
it; yet the most significant fact about instinct is the 
fact that instinct complexes are variable and modifiable. 
Warren says of the sucking human infant, “This in- 
volves several different reflexes. The first is the bend- 
ing movement of the child toward the breast, a reflex 
which may be stimulated by hunger or by sight or odor. 
Next is the grasping reflex with the lips; then follows 
the sucking reflex and finally the swallowing reflex. 
Each reflex action in this series furnishes a stimulus 
which leads to the succeeding reflex. The grasping 
movement of the lips is stimulated by the touch of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
  INSTINCT 215 
lips; the sucking movement by the grasping sensation, 
and swallowing by the action of the milk upon the 
tongue, lining of the mouth, and glottis. This succes- 
sion of response and stimulation is characteristic of in- 
stinctive behavior generally.” 
Such feeling is instinctive, but even in the very first 
act a highly complex process is meeting the emergencies 
of the situation. Later, varying with the conditions 
of the home, sucking gives way to drinking from a cup; 
this to the act — involving thousands of reflexes — of 
the taking of the milk with a spoon; this to the handling 
of solid food; this to the appropriate use of knife and 
fork and the adoption of other table amenities; this 
to the control of appetite; this to the pursuit of food 
and the development of the appetite of the epicure and 
the discrimination of the food concerned. 
Classification. — The classification of instincts differs 
essentially from the classification of reflexes in that 
the former is usually based on group activities, such 
as the nutritive, the reproductive, the defensive, the 
aggressive, and the social instincts; these may then 
be subdivided to represent smaller group instincts, such 
as feeding, mating, flight, rivalry, codperation; and 
subdivision after subdivision may be extended until 
we reach the specific and relatively simple reflexes. For 
practical purposes we can make as many classifications 
of instincts as we have purposes to be served and, though 
all may be different, each may be right. Thus, we may 
classify them, like emotions, into those that tend to 
preserve the individual, those that tend to preserve 
the race, and those that tend to preserve the social group. 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
216 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
Or, with McDougall, we may link them with typical 
emotions, as (1) the instinct of fleeing and the emotion 
of fear, (2) the instinct of repulsion and the emotion of 
disgust, (3) the instinct of curiosity and the emotion of 
wonder, (4) the instinct of pugnacity and the emotion 
of anger, (5) the instincts of self-abasement and self- 
assertion and the emotions of subjection and elation, 
(6) the parental instinct and the tender emotions, and 
other groups of less well-defined emotional tendencies.* 
It has been customary to recognize a series of instincts, 
as distinguished from reflexes, and use these as explana- 
tory principles, particularly in sociology, art, and educa- 
tion. There has been much wrangling about the nature 
and number of these instincts and even their existence 
has been questioned. Our present view gives instinct 
a large place in life, both animal and human, in that 
it recognizes its ever-presence in all mental life in the 
form of inherited reactions which form many of the in- 
gredients of our daily mental life. It enables us to 
recognize the large and permanent réle of “original 
nature”’ in character, skill, capacity, ability; emotions, 
impulses, and sentiments; even in thought and deliber- 
ate action. We shall not explain a few traits by instinct, 
as has been customary, but we shall regard instinct as 
one of the large factors in the account of each and all 
acts of mental life: This position becomes particularly 
significant in the study of the relative value of heredity 
and environment in mental growth, education, and 
character. The recognition of countless inherited re- 
actions in our perception, imagination, thought, feeling, 
and will sheds a strong light on the old controversy in 
 
-P-A-G-E-235
  INSTINCT 217 
that it throws into relief the “ original nature’’ as the 
permanent and dominant aspect of all our accomplish- 
ments.

EXERCISE. — (a) Spend exactly twelve minutes in writing the word 
Science upside down, with best combined effort for speed and 
accuracy. Write full lines across the page as in letter writing, and 
preserve the entire record. 
(b) In a similar manner, spend two minutes in writing the word 
Psychology upside down. Compare the quality and quantity 
of your achievement with that of others in the class. 
In this exercise you probably observe, among other 
things, that you first encountered difficulty, confusion, 
and failure. You made many kinds of mistakes; 
you were uncertain about the result ; you were interested 
in many elements of the new situation; you struggled 
with great effort. You were conscious of each part 
of every letter: you thought of sharp turn and round 
turn; turn right, turn left; move hand up, move hand 
right; long stroke, short stroke; light line, shaded 
line; letting hand go with a dash, or tracing slowly; 
hesitating in the middle of a stroke, and considering 
ways of doing it differently: You bit your teeth, 
puckered your lips, twitched your eyelids, fidgeted 
with hands and feet, braced up, and grasped the pen 
with conscious effort. You looked with painstaking 
care, were conscious of kinesthetic sensations, imaged 
the letter and movement in anticipation, were moved 
by feclings of failure and success, blamed and praised

yourself in turn, strained your attention, exerted your 
full will power. 
Indeed, at the beginning, your efforts were often ill 
directed, complicated, laborious, crude, slow, and un- 
economical ; ,but, even within the short period of twelve 
minutes, you made great progress, rapidly acquiring 
accuracy, simplicity, and speed in movement and econ- 
omy of effort in the new handwriting. You have ac- 
quired a new habit. By comparison with others, or 
with norms, you may also know something about your 
relative capacity for acquiring this sort of skill. 
That this habit is really a series of habits was demon- 
strated in Ex. 6; for many of the habits acquired in Ex. a 
were carried over to Ex. b, so that you probably got 
as good a result with a longer word in two minutes in 
the latter exercise as you got in twelve minutes in the 
former. 
In the same way you can readily see that you really 
entered upon Ex. a already equipped with a vast array 
of established habits without which the task would 
have been impossible in such a short time. And, as 
you reflect upon it, you recall that one of the difficulties 
encountered was the necessity of breaking up rigid 
old habits of writing right side up. 
You acquired a new habit chain, or skill, in a short time 
because you applied yourself efficiently. With but little 
further practice you would be able to write the word as 
’ well upside down as in the usual way. In the same man- 
ner you could acquire mirror writing, the ability to 
write with the left hand, with both hands simultaneously, 
to write with both hands and carry on a conversation 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
  220 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
at the same time, and as many similar tricks as you would 
have the interest and will power to train for. 
This exercise in learning is typical of what has taken 
place in the entire process of your physical and mental 
development. Your psychophysical growth, from ear- 
liest infancy, has been one continuous process of ac- 
quisition of skill through the progressive building up 
of habit chains, each new achievement being based upon 
previously acquired habit links. 
Nature of habit.— Learning, from infancy to old 
age, takes two forms: acquisition of facility of action, 
both physical and mental, and the acquisition of ideas 
and concepts. The former we call habit, the latter 
knowledge. Fundamentally these two aspects of the 
learning processes are alike from a neural point of view, 
in that they both consist of established neural paths; 
but it will simplify our study to consider them separately. 
In this chapter we shall limit ourselves to the former. 
On the basis of the above exercise, we may define 
habit as an acquired skill which tends to make an act 
purposive, simple, quick, uniform, easy, and economical. 
Or, stated from a neural point of view, the formation 
of a habit is the formation of a new pathway through 
which the nerve impulse may course to its proper des- 
tination over a direct and short route, well bridged at 
the synapse, rigid, and relatively independent of higher 
pathways. Trace the parallel in these two statements 
and interpret your experience in the exercise in terms 
of each of these in turn. 
Mental development takes the form of the progressive 
building of automatisms, self-acting systems in < 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
  HABIT 22r 
situations are met without the intervention of conscious- 
ness. The tendency in maturation is ever in the di- 
rection of reducing consciousness of detail in an act to 
its lowest level. As we have seen in the exercise, what 
at first requires the strain of the higher mental powers is 
gradually reduced to a lower, easier, and more stable 
course, so that, for the acquisition of each new habit, the 
higher consciousness is set free for the new tasks, since 
each acquired skill tends to operate automatically. It 
has been said that a perfectly formed character, if such 
there were, would be a perfect automatism. That is 
to say, action, however complex, would take on the char- 
acteristics of the reflex act; namely, purposiveness, 
simplicity, ease, speed, uniformity, and economy of 
effort. Thus, walking is at first acquired through per- 
sistent conscious effort. But when we have once learned 
to walk, habit adjusts the thousands of muscle fibers 
for each step in such a way as to serve the need of the 
moment; if no obstructions are encountered, each foot 
in turn comes forward promptly to meet the new situa- 
tion mechanically; the walking takes on a uniform, 
pendular swing, is easy, and may be gracefully continued 
without conscious effort while the mind is otherwise en- 
gaged. 
Habit may be either physical or mental, or both, 
as in habits of walking, habits of thinking, or habits of 
talking. Habits are formed at all mental levels. Hence 
we have habits of observation, of visualizing, recalling, 
relating things, taking emotional attitudes, and respond- 
ing in physical movements. Habit is, therefore, not 
only an occasional outburst of action, as in the habit  
-P-A-G-E-240
  222 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
of swearing or the habit of promptness; it is an all- 
pervading tendency of all behavior in our daily life. 
For although it is contrasted with consciously directed 
actions, it is present in the component forms of all higher 
forms of action, as in reasoning or acting deliberately 
upon choice. 
The term is used in a double meaning. Thus, in 
eating with a fork, we speak of the habit of using a fork 
as opposed to knife or spoon. But the manipulation of 
the fork itself involves a complicated chain of specific 
habits. If it were not so, our food would miss its des- 
tination. 
Explanation of habit. — The explanation of habit for- 
mation is to be found in the laws of association. The 
law most generally effective is the law of frequency, 
which we call practice: indeed, practice has been called 
the law of habit. To understand the psychology and 
physiology of this phase of the learning process, then, we 
have only to appeal to the psychological and physio- 
logical interpretation of association as treated in earlier 
chapters. 
The modification of the nervous system through 
habit formation is made possible, as we saw in Chapter 
XIII, by the unique provision that neural paths are 
not formed by the actual growing together of successive 
neurons in the chain; the neurons lie in bunches like 
live wires, most delicately insulated in such a way that 
a new path may be forced through at any synapse, and 
old paths may be blocked by interference or disuse. 
Thus we must think of the mental development through 
habit formation as taking place through the delicate
-P-A-G-E-241
  Ia 223 
changes in conductivity for the transmission of nerve 
impulses at the synapse. 
In explaining habit, we must apply our general theory 
of the relation of mind and body. All habits, physical 
and mental, might be interpreted and explained consist- 
ently and fully in terms of neural processes if we had 
access to the facts. Our interest is, however, not in 
these, but in behavior, in what is accomplished, and in 
the experience of accomplishing. Discussions of habit 
are, therefore, usually cast in psychological terms. 
Instinct and habit. — The habitual act is like an in- 
stinctive act; but the two differ in their origin, one 
being perfected in the life of the species, and the other 
in the life of the individual. The infant comes into the 
world with his mind a tabula rasa; i.e., a blank, so far 
as knowledge or ideas are concerned. But he comes 
well equipped with organized systems of instinctive ca- 
pacities, sensitive to stimuli, ready to “store up” ex- 
perience, and to preserve life. Instincts being modi- 
fiable, the development of the individual takes the 
form of a progressive adaptation of the inborn capacities 
to fit them to the growing needs of the individual. 
In this process there is no leap or break: the transition 
from one step to the next is gradual and natural as we 
have seen, ¢.g., in our discussion of the modification 
of the feeding instinct. Thus habit is instinct or re- 
flex progressively adapted, enlarged, and extended on 
the basis of individual experience. 
There are characteristic periods in the life of the in- 
dividual for the formation of the various types of habit. 
Thus, the ordinary habits of orientation through use 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
  224 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
of the senses with associated muscular response in re- 
action to what goes on in the environment are developed 
early in the life of the child. The child, upon entering 
school, has already acquired the serviceable use of all 
his senses, even in complicated forms, such as the seeing 
of relief, distance, and direction; the habit of antici- 
pating in images, the habit of expecting natural sequence 
of cause and effect, or making inferences; the habit of 
natural attitudes of approval and disapproval; even 
the habit of using his will power. And for all these 
purposes: his muscles are relatively well mastered so 
that the vocal organs perform almost inconceivably 
intricate adjustments in speed; the hand is an adequate 
tool of the mind, and the muscles of movement, pos- 
ture, and all other forms of adjustment are relatively 
at easy command. 
Learning in school and after school consists essentially 
in the acquisition of specific skills for which fundamental 
elements were acquired in early childhood. Thus, in 
the mastery of marbles, baseball, bat, racket, oar, golf 
stick, or trigger, each new habit is essentially a new 
chain made from links in the vast fund of fundamental 
habits. But when we attribute so much to fundamental 
habits early acquired, we are only stressing the fact that 
these are essentially ‘“ racial habits” or instincts which 
represent neural paths fixed through millions of years 
Ofe@gehtiGns In other words, the fundamental habits, 
such as control of sense organs and muscles, and countless 
sorts of adjustments are, essentially instincts which 
have established themselves by the outlet furnished in 
early habit formation. 
’
-P-A-G-E-243
HABIT 225 
“ Capacity and ability. — Two common words, capacity 
and ability, have acquired technical meaning in modern 
psychology. Capacity refers to organic equipment 
acquired in the process of .emekuti@n (7.c., adapted organs 
with the instinct to use them) ; ability referd to habit or 
skill acquired through the use of capacity in the life of 
the individual. Thus, we are endowed with a well-or- 
ganized series of capacities for control of finger move- 
ments; we acquire the ability to use them in all sorts of 
skilful and deliberate finger action for specific ends, 
such as threading a needle or playing the piano. We 
are born with capacity for seeing form; we develop abil- 
ity for the meaningful perception of form through pro- 
gressive use of this capacity. We are born with capati- 
ties for memory, imagination, and deliberation; we 
cultivate ability to use these capacities. The distin- 
guishing mark of capacity is that it is elemental, by which 
we mean that it is a comparatively simple unit, is ex- 
ercised very early in play, and is relatively independent 
of age, training, and general intelligence. The sense 
organs and the muscles with their inherited control 
have as good capacity before education as they will 
ever have afterward. Education, growth, and effort re- 
sult in the development of abilities — not in the improve- 
ment of natural capacities. The character of the origi- 
nal equipment for any process, both as to quality and 
quantity, has been called a “ personal equation,” and 
may be regarded as an index to the natural resources 
of an individual in a given capacity. 
Habit and attention. — The most significant feature 
of habit formation is the gradual reduction of the need ”
-P-A-G-E-244
  226 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
of attention and effort. The lowering of the attention 
is, however, perhaps mainly a matter of degree, since 
consciousness seems to be more or less on the alert, or 
in readiness for functioning, even with our best acquired 
habits, such as walking, chewing, and various forms 
of highly perfected skill in the handling of tools and in- 
struments. 
On the other hand, certain habits or habit chains 
demand attention of the most effective and sponta- 
neous kind. Stout gives the example of fencing: 
“The most expert fencer can not afford to allow him- 
self to be absorbed in an irrelevant train of thought 
while he is engaged in a duel. On the contrary, the 
keenest watchfulness is required. The reason is that 
only certain component parts of the action have become 
thoroughly habitual; these do not of themselves re- 
quire to be attended to. The practised fencer has not 
to think about the proper modes of thrusting and parry- 
ing; what requires attention is the tactics of his oppo- 
nent. As soon as he discerns by sight or feeling the di- 
rection in which his antagonist’s rapier is moving, the 
proper reply is made automatically. Thus, attention 
is demanded for the proper combination of a series of 
movements which are severally automatic, a combina- 
tion which has to be adjusted to constantly fluctuating 
conditions.” 
“Habit a fly-wheel of society. — Habit is thus the 
enormous fly-wheel of society, its most precious conserv- 
ative agent. It alone is what keeps us all within the 
bounds of ordinance, and saves the children of fortune 
from the envious uprisings of the poor. It alone pre- 
vents the hardest and most repulsive walks of life from 
being deserted by those brought up to tread therein. 
It keeps the fisherman and the deck-hand at sea through 
the winter; it holds the miner in his darkness, and nails

  HABIT 227 
the countryman to his log-cabin and his lonely farm 
through all the months of snow; it protects us from 
invasion by the natives of the desert and the frozen zone. 
It dooms us all to fight out the battle of life upon the 
lines of our nurture or our early choice, and to make the 
best of a pursuit that disagrees, because there is no other 
for which we are fitted, and it is too late to begin again. 
It keeps different social strata from mixing. Already 
at the age of twenty-five you see the professional man- 
nerism settling down on the young commercial traveller, 
on the young doctor, on the young minister, on the 
young counselor-at-law. You see the little lines of 
thought, the prejudices, the ways of the ‘shop,’ in a word, 
from which the man can by-and-by no more escape than 
his coat-sleeve can suddenly fall into a new set of folds. 
On the whole, it is best he should not escape. It is well 
for the world that in most of us, by the age of thirty, 
the character has set like plaster, and will never soften 
again.” (James) 
Principles of habit formation. — The principles that 
govern habit formation are essentially the same as those 
that govern the acquisition of knowledge. In the inter- 
est of economy, some of these are set forth together in 
the following chapter in the learning process. That 
chapter will serve well also to show the relationship be- 
tween habit and memory. The laws for the formation 
of habit may also be applied in the interest of the pre- 
vention of the formation of undesirable habits. In our 
“mixed nature” the avoidance of evil is often as im- 
portant as the acquisition of the good. But in general, 
pedagogically, the best way to avoid the formation of 
evil habits is not to think about that, but to have our 
minds bent upon the acquisition of the good and desir- 
able.
-P-A-G-E-246
  228 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
We are very wasteful in the use of our capacity for 
good habit formations. If, for instance, you pursued 
every goal with the same persistent effort that you gave 
for twelve minutes to the writing of a word upside down, 
most wonderful results might be attained. We fail in 
the attainment of high achievement in the way of skills 
largely because the normal life of the average individual 
is a sort of dawdling, aimless floundering, without fixed 
objectives. Observe the skilful stenographer, the artist 
at work, the expert tradesman, the phenomenal chess 
player, the mathematician, the athlete, and you will 
see the exhibition of as many skills, each having had 
normal development through persistent practice. We 
are endowed with so infinite a variety of capacities, and 
the world is so interesting in its play of variety to the 
normal individual, that, like the traditional ass which 
died of starvation for want of decision between two hay- 
stacks, we often fail to make use of the opportunities 
for the acquisition of countless most interesting and 
valuable skills which are quite within our reach. The 
same is true of habit in little things, things which might 
be mastered with but slight concentrated effort, but in 
which we remain helpless and indifferent throughout 
life. Were it not for nature’s wealth of provisions 
through instinctive tendencies, we should grow quite 
helpless, as a relatively small number of the necessary 
skills for normal life are acquired through serious effort 
and direction. The majority come through stress of cir- 
cumstance and natural, passive bent of mind — by 
chance. 
The goal of education should be the early formation
-P-A-G-E-247
  HABIT 229 
of the habit of forming habits. Among such are the habits 
of concentration upon a task in hand with persistence, 
relaxation after sustained effort, interest in achieve- 
ment, success in mastery, self-confidence, ambition, and 
forethought in planning.

THE LEARNING PROCESS 
Exercise. — This chapter is ft sustained exercise in memory train- 
ing. Go through it slowly and critically once and put each rule into 
practice after it has been encountered. At the end of the chapter, 
without looking bade, write a skeletal outline, listing in abbreviation 
all the facts from the chapter that you can recall.+ 
President Porter has said that a good memory de- 
pends upon a good digestion, a good logic, and a good 
conscience. Health, the power of mental application, 
and an upright life—these are the fundamental condi- 
tions of good memory. We may take for granted the 
first and the last of these conditions, which come within 
the domain of physiology and ethics respectively, and 
ee pa the psychological factor of mental economy. 
Y A good memory is not one that remembers everything. 
If one were doomed to remember everything that came 
within his experience, he would find himself hopelessly 
swamped, distracted, possibly insane. 
e test of a good memory is that it shall be service- 
able; that the mind shall be furnished and ready with 
al the sort of facts which may be needed, ‘and free 
/-“from the encumbrances of useless, irrelevant, or dis- 
1The present chapter taken from the author’s Psychology in Daily Life, 
with generous permission of the publishers (D. Appleton & Co., N. Y.), is in- 
troduced here as a sustained illustration of applied psychology of the learning 
process, stripped of all technicalities. It should be regarded as a practical 
ewercise for the chapters on Habit and Memory.

tracting material. In addition, these facts should be 
accurate, “ faithful to the original”; they should be 
~ long retained, if necessary; they should come promptly, 
easily, and conveniently. Improvement in memory 
will be judged with reference to these and allied stand- 
ards. 
A valuable body of knowledge in regard to the nature 
of the memory process and the principle of acquisition has 
been accumulated by experimental methods. Instead of 
summarizing these facts in a technical way I shall for- 
mulate a series of simple rules of memory-training in the 
language of every-day experience, in so far as possible, 
in harmony with these facts. The chief statements 
will be put in the form of commands or rules, not for 
the sake of exhortation, let it be emphatically said, but 
for the sake of clearness and brevity. 
These rules may be grouped under four general heads: 
Impression, Association, Recall, and Recognition. 
Under these only the more typical rules are considered ; 
details or qualifications must be omitted. This is not 
a memory “system ”’; it is merely a series of selected 
illustrations. The artifice of a “ corollary ” under each 
rule is not taken in a rigid, logical sense, but merely 
serves to suggest, through a single illustration, some- 
thing of the rich radiations of a given rule. 
I. Ru es oF Impression 
1. Select your field of interest (Selection). 
Corottary: Dare to be ignorant of many things. 
Nature provides for rigid selection in all directions 
by setting limits to our capacities, thereby forcing in-
-P-A-G-E-250
  232 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
stinctive selection of interests and favoring the formation 
of ruts. We may, however, vastly enhance the service- 
ableness of our memory by a deliberate selecting of 
life interests which we shall take seriously by our nature 
and choice as well as by the force of circumstances. To 
remember serviceably is to reach promptly the data 
. desired; and, to do this systematically, the mind’s 
eye must be trained to focus automatically upon the 
desired memory-object. 
If one is to be a banker he should train himself actively 
and systematically to remember facts pertaining to 
banking: not that he should limit his interests to bank- 
ing; he must have life interests, such, for example, as 
pertain to social life, to health, or to intellectual pur- 
suits. But these interests should be only a few out of 
the many toward which he might be inclined by nature. 
It is the man. who keeps his mind on banking during 
banking hours who becomes a financier. If he attends 
in the same way to other obligations out of banking 
hours he will be also socially attractive and will find 
satisfaction in a larger life. This is true alike in the 
humbler walks of life and in its highest pursuits. 
Occasional and casual selection of memory-objects 
does not strengthen memory power, but on the contrary 
often weakens it. To strengthen memory the selection 
must follow a system of habits based_upon life interests. 
This implies that the selection shall be made in large 
units of.interest ; that intruding interests shall be elimi- 
nated by habits of application; that the mind, free from // 
anxiety, shall feel itself adjusted to the situations which 
confront it.
-P-A-G-E-251
  THE LEARNING PROCESS 233 
2, Intend to remember (Intention). 
CoroLtiaRy: ‘Trust your memory. 
An Indian woman began her business career by trad- 
ing in primitive fashion with the pioneers in a village of 
Colorado. The population grew gradually, and with it 
her trade expanded into a large general merchandise 
establishment which supplied the community with every- 
thing from food, clothing, and jewelry to threshing- 
machines. This woman remained her own bookkeeper. 
She maintained an extensive credit account, but kept 
no books. She trusted her memory; and it served her 
well because the demands upon it increased so gradually 
that she never lost confidence in herself. 
To intend to remember means to fix the impression 
with confidence. To trust memory means to have the 
habit of intending to remember. Sporadic intentions 
are unreliable. The intentions that count in life are 
habitual — constant, not casual. When the intention 
to remember has become a habit, memory serves with 
little effort; instead of being a matter of concern, re- 
membering becomes a matter of comfort and ease, just 
as does truth ‘telling. Such is the natural habit of a 
goodmemory. We enjoy things, we observe distinctions, ™ 
we think truths, trusting that they are ours; and our 2 
memory serves us well. 
3. Attend to the selected object (Attention). 
CoroLtary: Secure the most effective form of atten- 
tion. 
Put yourself into such a channel of life that what you 
need to remember is that in which you are naturally 
interested.
-P-A-G-E-252
  234 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
The majority of college students who are unfit for 
study might be discovered by this criterion: ‘“ Has this 
student a natural interest in that which he is trying to 
learn?’ College authorities might do well to apply 
this test rigidly early in the course and eliminate those 
who find no natural interest in their studies, thereby 
encouraging them before too late to seek other channels 
of education in which they would find themselves 
effectual. The charge to the entering freshman should 
bes" Learn that which you care for; and, if the col- 
a lege course does not arouse in you a feeling of fitness 
| 
\ for the work, go elsewhere ; for there is something wrong 
either with you or with the college.” 
Our rule is, therefore, not the trite admonition: ‘“ Pay 
attention.” That rule has its value; but voluntary 
attention is seldom more than a precarious makeshift in 
the ordinary work and experiences of life; it is too rare 
,and costly. Voluntary attention is one of the highest \ 
and most indispensable achievements of man, but the 
attention that serves the steady flow of the stream of 
consciousness must be spontaneous and yet semi-auto- 
matic. It may be called derived primary attention 
because it has been favored and encouraged until it has 
become second\nature. Attention to a dog fight is pas- 
sive, but attention to the traits and achievements of 
dogs from the point of view of the dog-fancier or the 
animal psychologist is secondary passive, because it 
flows from a consciously directed natural interest. 
This rule affects the entire plan of our daily life. 
Power depends upon leverage. In memory, as in all 
other forms of force, the main thing is to get a leverage ; 
’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
THE LEARNING PROCESS 235 
and the best leverage for memory is a genuine interest. 
The modern movement in vocational direction will do 
much to increase the serviceableness of the memory- 
grasp of those who are wisely guided into natural chan- 
nels of life-work. : 
4. Grasp the elements (Elements). 
’ Corottary: Let essentials stand out in a relief. 
To remember the above three rules after they have 
been understood, it is not necessary to fix the more 
than five hundred words comprised in the statements 
and illustrations. A single key-word for each rule will 
suffice ; for example, selection, intention, attention. To 
impress the illustrations and interpretations in their 
elements the mental note might run something like this: 
Selection: nature’s selection, banker, habit ; 
Intention: squaw, habit ; 
Attention: studies, derived primary, leverage. 
The key-word for each rule must represent a concrete 
unit of thought; and the three key-words for the re- 
spective rules must be grasped as a single unit embodying 
the common element of the three ideas — namely, con- 
centration upon the impression. 
The good reader: will have analyzed in this way, be- 
cause it is his way of reading, and at this point the 
thought stands out concrete and logical; whereas the 
inferior reader will have ‘plowed through the stuff” 
in a helpless way and can not retrace his steps, because 
he has not grasped the elements in the reading. The 
* effect of observing and of thinking in terms of the ele- 
ments involved is not merely to reduce the number of 
necessary words or symbols, but rather to give per-
-P-A-G-E-254
23 6 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
spective to the essentials. It affords something to take 
hold of. 
5. Trust the primary impression (Primacy). 
CoroLtary: Master as you go. 
The facts relating to the attention wave and the 
proper mastery of elements, as described above, have a 
striking application here. If you want a good, clear 
picture by time exposure. take one exposure of the re- 
quired length. Do not blur by trying to get a summa- 
tion of impressions. So, in making a mental picture) 
observe so as to grasp the object in a single firm impres+ 
sion. Trust that impression and seal it with the inten- 
tion to remember. 
This principle is opposed to the rote method. To 
memorize a poem do not merely grind it over and over 
in a mechanical way, but, after a preliminary reading, 
read it logically; go slowly, step.by step, intending to 
learn it in the best way; attend to the task with a mind 
prepared to discover the essential elements of the struc- 
ture and determined to make the first impression trust- 
worthy. 
The rules of memory may be represented by a pyra- 
mid; the side of the pyramid, which we have now ap- 
proached, is designated Impression. Reading from the 
base upward, the steps or elevations rise in this natural . 
order : 
Primacy: Trust the primary impression 
Elements: Grasp the elements 
Attention: Attend to the selected object 
Intention: Intend to remember 
Selection: Select your field of interest
-P-A-G-E-255
  THE LEARNING PROCESS — 237 
6. Practice systematic observation (Practice). 
Corottary: ‘ Do it now.” 
Ordinarily the development of memory is left to 
chance, to a casual issue. We°know only a few of the 
laws of memory and make but little effort to apply 
these. We grow up so gradually that there is ordinarily 
no particular moment at which the value of practice is 
forced upon us. In the training of the young there 
might well be introduced some instruction in the princi- 
ples of memory training to be followed by a régime in 
which the command, “ Do it now,” could be enforced. 
Systematic training yields remarkable results, whether 
the memory be originally very good or only ordinarily 
retentive. It is not necessary to set drill exercises on 
mere drill material, nor is it necessary or desirable to 
follow any of the hundreds of artificial systems sold by 
professional trainers of memory. The thing to do is to 
)learn the fundamental facts about memory and then 
i \ simply apply them as we go about our ordinary duties 
\of the day. No more economic lesson could be set than 
to learn by doing the very thing you are to do. Meet 
the situations which are a part of your life routine with 
the habits of interest, trust, discernment, thought, and 
application and you will practice the above six rules 
and many others with a corresponding growth in effi- 
ciency. Crown the pyramid of Impression, then, by the 
capstone, Practice. 
II. Rutes or AssociaTION 
1. Recognize relationships (Relationships). 
CoroLtAry: Be familiar with the laws of association.
-P-A-G-E-256
  238 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
It is announced that a friend is to be married in June. 
The moment I hear this I say to myself: ‘ How appro- 
priate! June is the wedding month; it is the month of 
roses; it is the month which symbolizes the blossoming 
into life. I cannot fail to remember it.” In this way 
we ordinarily relate impressions, be they ever so isolated 
or abstract. 
Our rule does not imply any one formulated applica- 
tion of association but rather the habitual attitude of 
appreciation. But this power of appreciation is vastly 
increased and strengthened by insight into the nature 
of the laws of association. Despite their controver- 
sial history among psychologists, the rules of associa- 
tion are in fact surprisingly few and clear to common 
sense. 
Our rule is to observe the relations of impressions, 
Knowledge of these possible relations facilitates the 
presentation of facts and supplies us a means of holding 
them for recall. One illustration must suffice. The 
law of similarity is the basis of all scientific classification ; 
without it there could be no science. The botanist can 
recognize and recall thousands of plants because he has 
formed the habit of seeing relationships. One plant is 
like another plant in this, and that, and another respect ; 
therefore they belong to the same class. Instead of 
remembering the hundred or thousand individual 
plants, the botanist remembers only one representative 
plant and the relationships within the class to which it 
belongs. This is often pictured in a more or less com- 
posite image; but the consciousness involved in that 
image is the consciousness of relations. Our first rule
-P-A-G-E-257
  THE LEARNING PROCESS 239 
of association is the general charge to set your facts in a 
system of relations. 
2. Form habits of analyzing (Analysis). 
Corottary: Learn by thinking. 
This rule may be variously illustrated. It is a favor- 
ite principle in the modern mnemonic systems of which 
the system of Loisette is a good illustration. Loisette 
was a famous memory teacher in New York. The main 
secret of his system (and it was sold as a secret) consisted 
in a somewhat artificial application of this principle. 
Taking the three laws of association which he called 
inclusion, exclusion, and concurrence, he devised a pro- 
gressive series of exercises in which the learner acquired 
great ability in discovering clear-cut relations; 7.¢., the 
ability to perceive and recall in terms of such relations 
consciously recognized, yet directly and easily as one 
sees directly and without effort the color of a flower. The 
following is his illustration of the meaning of the first 
law, inclusion : 
Inctusion indicates that there is an overlapping of 
meaning between two words, or that there is a promi- 
nent idea or sound that belongs to both alike, or that a 
similar fact or property belongs to two events or things 
as, to enumerate a few classes : 
Whole and Part. — (Earth, poles) (ship, rudder) (forest, 
trees) (air, oxygen) (house, parlor) (clock, pendulum) 
(knife, blade) (India, Punjab) (14, 7). 
Genus and Species. — (Animal, man) (plant, thyme) (fish, 
salmon) (tree, oak) (game, pheasant) (dog, retriever) 
(universal evolution, natural selection) (silver lining, 
relief of Lucknow) (Empress, Queen Victoria).

240 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
Abstract and Concrete. — (The same quality appears 
both in the adjective and in the substantive.) — 
(Dough, soft) (empty, drum) (lion, strong) (eagle, 
swift) (courage, hero) (glass, smoothness) (gold, duc- 
tility) (sunshine, light) (fire, warmth). 
Similarity of Sound. — (Emperor, empty) (salvation, 
salamander) (hallelujah, hallucination) (cat, catas- 
trophe) (top, topsy). 
Simple inclusion embraces cases not found in either of 
the foregoing classes, but where there is something 
im common between the pairs, as (church, temple) 
(pocket, black hole). 
The first exercise consists in learning the following 
list of ten words in a single reading by aid of the recogni- 
tion of these principles of inclusion :

-P-A-G-E-259
  THE LEARNING PROCESS 241 
Such. analysis of the words and their relations serves to 
fix the relationship, and it is possible to repeat the list 
forward and backward after one such reading. Apply- 
ing this principle to the remembering of numbers, Loisette 
gives such illustrations as these: the height of Pikes 
Peak is 14,147 feet; observe that the number consists of 
two 14’s anda half of 14. Fujiyama, the noted volcano 
of Japan, is 12,365 feet high; observe that this number 
is made up of the number of months and of days in the 
year — 12 and 365. 
This may serve as a partial illustration of a memory sys- 
tem which possesses some merit. As a matter of fact, 
now that it is printed in a book and sold for a dollar, 
very little use is made of it. When it was sold for fifty 
dollars or more, with a pledge of secrecy, the buyer ac- 
tually followed the directions in order to get what he paid 
for; and he often got it. Merely to read the book will 
be of no avail. If there were some contrivance by which 
one could extract fifty dollars for the chapter on memory 
training which you are now reading, its usefulness would 
be greatly increased. 
3. Force concrete imagery (Forcing). 
Coro.iary: Fix the first fancy. 
By following this rule a person with ordinary memory 
may learn a list of fifty or a hundred disconnected words 
in a single reading so that he can repeat the whole list 
either forward or backward. Try it. Here are the 
instructions : Have some one read a list of words slowly, 
or uncover one word at a time by yourself, and at the very 
first impression that you get from the words observe some 
connection (the more bizarre the better) between the new
-P-A-G-E-260
  242 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
word and the preceding one; picture this relationship 
concretely and add a new section to the group image for 
each new word added to the chain of words; fix the 
first fancy ‘of each relationship, and image it boldly. 
But before we try the experiment let us illustrate the 
procedure with a short list of words. 
Boy —I see a little barefooted boy 
Grass — walking in the tall grass; 
Glass — the stalks of grass crackle like glass under his 
fect: 
Pike — therefore he is glad when he sees the open 
pike. 
Scissors — his little legs clip like scissors, 
Ventilation — and his lungs get good ventilation, 
Bird — for he flies like a bird 
Nickel — and swings his nickel-plated rod 
Fury — like fury 
Gear — because he is now in gear with nature. 
Each learner will have a different set of associations. 
It is important that he should use his own, and, so far 
as possible, use the first association that comes to his mind. 
It is the concrete imaging of the fancied situations as a 
unit that welds the words together in memory. 
As a matter of fact, this is the method we naturally 
employ in ordinary routine memory. There is an auto- 
mobile accident, and a witness is called to report. Hecan 
give a fairly good report because he has a definite notion 
of the relations of figures in the scene: the chauffeur 
looking back, the horse struck on the front knees, the 
lady’s hatpin flying in the air, the first aid to the injured, 
horses and rider, etc.
-P-A-G-E-261
  THE LEARNING PROCESS 243 
4. Grasp in large units (Large Units). 
CoroLtARy: Remember ideas, not words. 
In one sense memory improves with mental growth 
because we learn to think in larger and larger units. A 
little boy goes with his father to a museum and sees a 
collection of shells. The boy sees and will remember a few 
forms which strike his fancy, but the father, who knows 
his systematic classification, is able to give a better 
account of the group, for he learned by large units; 
whereas the boy treated each shell as an individual object, 
with the exception possibly of obvious similarities. 
5. Observe synthetically (Synthesis). 
Corotiary: Build elements into a whole. 
The rule is a rule of accumulation. In reading for the 
purpose of memorizing, the proper procedure is to read 
each word in the sentence and, before proceeding further, 
to grasp the sentence as a unit ; then, treating the sentence 
as an element in the same way, to grasp the paragraph 
as a unit of sentences. 
To bind the impression once firmly grasped, be famil- 
iar with the bonds that fasten new acquisitions to what 
you already have, examine these ties deliberately and 
make sure that they bind; clinch with some additional 
ties — the first that you find in your own rich personal 
supply ; make each bundle as large as you can, and then 
tie all the bundles together. See our pyramid: 
Synthesis: Observe synthetically 
~ Large units: Grasp in large units 
Forcing: Force concrete imagery 
Analysis: Form habits of analyzing 
Relationships: Recognize relationships 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
  244 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
6. Practice. 
As in impression, so in association, knowledge of these 
laws is of no use unless it be put into practice. In itself, 
the knowledge is not power. One trial does not give 
power. The power of association is fully effective only 
when it is so firmly ingrained by practice as to operate 
automatically and irresistibly, and therefore with ease. 
Mounting the pyramid from the side of Association, we 
rise from another side to the original capstone, Practice. 
III. Rutes or REcALL 
1. Be persistent in the effort to recall (Persistence). 
Corottary: Seek clues and follow them: try. 
This is the logical sequel to the rule of impression, 
“ Intend to remember.”’ It is a very common occurrence 
that we have established good impressions in association 
and yet fail through negligence in the recall. If the mem- 
ory image is not at command as soon as sought, we all 
too readily conclude that we cannot reach it. 
Ability to recall is not, like the ability to lift or the 
ability to hear, restricted by any sharply. limiting sense 
organ. If the memory image comes to me immediately, 
that is largely a matter of chance; I chance to have in 
mind the impression or idea which has such associations 
with the image sought that it draws it out promptly. 
Our rule encourages us to use all our effort and ingenuity 
in search for an association which shall draw out the de- 
sired image. Mere blind persistence, often the mere 
lapse of time, brings out the proper association; but 
vastly more can be accomplished if the effort is made 
to review systematically the events which lead up to the
-P-A-G-E-263
  
THE LEARNING PROCESS 245 
desired link. We must retrieve, not merely flush, the 
game. 
Here again the importance does not attach so much 
to the isolated effort as to the formation of the habit 
of discovering clues and following them. Training in 
this will place at one’s command a power of insight into 
relations and a power to follow lines of association tena- 
ciously, yet with decreasing effort. 
2. Repeat the recall often (Repetition). 
CoroLLtary: Never miss the opportunity of seeing a 
good friend. 
It has been said that to learn a technical subject, such 
as anatomy, one must have forgotten it several times and 
have learned it over again. That is what happens as a 
rule in our casual occupations, but it is very wasteful. 
The more economic way is to trust the initial impression ; 
hold it until it is fixed by some bond of association; then, 
instead of repeating the impression, recall and repeat the 
recall as often as may be necessary. One recall is worth 
more than a dozen impressions because it is the recall 
and not the impression which we aim to fix. 
This rule has two distinct applications. In the first 
place, it gives us the procedure for the building up of a 
complex impression, such as a long definition or a poem. 
As we have seen above, the impressions should be cumula- 
tive; that is, the reader should learn one after another the 
elements of the impression singly or in simple groups, 
and then progressively unite these until the complex is 
grasped as a whole. In the welding together of these 
elements in the impression, the elements should be handled 
in recall, and not in repeated impressions of parts. Thus e 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
246 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
the impression in the case of complete memory object 
passes gradually by steps from impression to recall, and 
the impression is not complete until the large units can 
be held firm and true in clear recall. 
In the second place, the rule applies to the securing of 
permanent retention. Instead of forgetting the anatomy 
and then going back to learn it over and over again, the 
economic way is to review in memory, instead of in im- 
pression, as often as may be necessary to prevent the 
intrusion of errors in recall. There are, of course, 
exceptions to this rule. I learn the streets of a city for 
guidance on a visit, but if I am not to visit that city for 
twenty years it would be waste of energy to keep that 
memory alive. The rule applies, however, to all cases in 
which we desire to keep the remembrance continuously 
available. 
3. Be rigidly exact in recall (Rigidity). 
Corottary: In forming a habit, suffer no violation. 
The ability to recall a specific event is a habit. There- 
fore, in practicing recall, all the laws of good habit forma- 
tion should be obeyed. Easy-going and slovenly recall 
is doubly wasteful. “This applies particularly to the pre- 
ceding rule and places additional emphasis upon the 
first impression. 
4. Keep out the irrelevant (Relevance). 
Corotitary: Concentrate on the recall. 
If all the memory rules should be reduced to one, 
that rule might be expressed in the single word, “‘ Con- 
centrate.” The ability to concentrate attention upon the 
act in hand is a criterion of a well-developed mind. Sup- 
pose that you are preparing for an examination in history.
-P-A-G-E-265
  
THE LEARNING PR 247 
You are rehearsing (not reading over again except to 
verify) the principal groups of facts to be remembered ; 
each and every individual fact has a rich fringe of asso- 
ciations reaching out into all sorts of matters which have 
nothing to do with the facts of history, and each of these 
offers avenues for distraction. * Our rule, humiliatingly 
simple, says: Do not let your mind wander from the 
matter in hand — these related historical facts. What 
a waste of human effort results from the violation of this 
stern rule through lax habits-and inherent laziness. 
5. Rest economically (Rest). 
Corottary: Respect the attention-wave. 
It is a familiar fact that we can recall best when the 
mind is fresh after rest. It is good economy to take a 
period of rest before a pending serious tax of the memory. 
But this rule has more important applications. Ex- 
periments have shown that we work best mentally when 
we work periodically rather than in continuous strain. 
Consciousness has a natural periodicity; the more we 
favor this periodicity, the more effective we become. The 
periodicity may be traced in second-waves through two to 
ten seconds, minute-waves consisting of groups of second- 
waves, and hour-waves such as the well-known periodicity 
of theday. Now inrecall— and most of our memorizing, 
as seen above, should be more or less in the nature of 
recall—we should reach back intensively for a short 
time and then relax completely for a periodic rest. 
This periodic activity in simple waves may then be 
grouped in larger waves. It is a notable fact that 
those who seem to work the hardest enjoy the most 
complete relaxation.
-P-A-G-E-266
  248 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
We have now approached the pyramid from a third 
side, Recall, and see in relief the five steps : 
Rest: Rest economically 
Relevance: Keep out the irrelevant 
Rigidity: Be rigidly exact in recall 
' Repetition: Repeat the recall often 
Persistence: Be persistent in the effort to recall 
6. Practice. 
Once more, that which counts in the improvement of 
recall is systematic practice in recall. So we mount again 
upon the hard and solid capstone, Practice. : 
IV. Ruies or RECOGNITION 
1. Recognize the memory image as you would a friend 
(Recognition). 
Corotrary: “Cut” your friend and he will cut you. 
Our thoughts are the children of our minds; our 
memories are a part of our past. Memory is never 
complete until the feeling is present that this event has 
occurred before. It must be recognized as a part of the 
past but with reference to the present personal associ- 
ations. This recognition is seldom complete. It is 
usually based upon a feeling of familiarity and power, and 
takes the form of a simple belief. 
The mere recall is usually automatic and results in 
action without the intervention of consciousness. Most 
of my daily activities are in a sense acts of recall, recog- 
nized. To complete the conscious memory this memory 
image must be singled out and recognized with warmth, 
as a friend is singled out from a passing throng, and 
greeted. Apply the principle of recognition in friend-
-P-A-G-E-267
  THE LEARNING PROCESS 249 
ship to the recognition of memories and they will be 
yours. Our children and co-laborers may be about us, 
but we do not stop to greet them, for they are with us 
continuously. Many of our most indispensable memories 
are always with us without intruding upon our time or 
attention. The rule should be: when memory images 
come which you desire to fix, greet them warmly and 
confidingly and they will return to you in time of need. 
2. Cultivate realistic imagery in recognition (Im- 
agery). 
CorottAry: Reinstate the original setting. 
In meeting a person you shake hands with him, look 
him in the eye, speak a word, and seal the bond of friend- 
ship. So in recalling a friend do not merely entertain 
an imageless idea of him, but see him, feel him, hear him, 
feel yourself responding to him, let him stand forth in a 
natural setting of an earlier meeting and thus make the 
recognition realistic and tangible. Such experience takes 
the form of rich and vivid imagery and may be cultivated 
with success, even if this does not come spontaneously. 
Its effect is to make the recall intense and rich in detail. 
You will soon form the habit of having this reinstatement 
of an earlier meeting a specific one ; it may be the first, the 
last, the most typical, or the most impressive. A memory 
is not complete until we can localize it in time and place, 
either directly or indirectly. This habit of concrete 
imagery has the advantage of resetting the event in the 
proper time and place, as though we were living the event 
over again in the original. As toward friends, so toward 
memories, our feelings of worth, recognition, and attach- 
ment reach out to them and bind them to us.
-P-A-G-E-268
  250 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
3. Express the recognition in appropriate action (Ex- 
pression). 
CoroLtary: Grow through self-expression. 
If you desire to remember the name of a friend be sure 
that you speak it with full comprehension the moment 
you reach out your hand upon introduction. Then, when 
you recall him, recall him by name; and when you meet 
him again, do not merely say ‘ Good morning,” but 
speak his name as you did upon first meeting and in the 
recall. More than that introduce your old friends to 
new friends from time to time. The application of this 
principle of friendship to the events and things 
of daily life is close. The operation is the same as in 
business; a rule of economy becomes yours only if, in 
addition to learning it, you apply it to your business 
relations. 
4. Transfer from conscious to organic memory 
(Transference). 
Corottary: “From conscious effort to ready skill.” 
At first the memory of each step and each element 
should be focal in the consciousness of memory and im- 
agination; but, as soon as the skill has been acquired, 
consciousness is free for other and for higher achieve- 
ments. Organic memory retains and reproduces its 
facts so that they result in appropriate expression with- 
out the intervention of consciousness, and is therefore 
easy and reliable. The ability to transfer conscious 
memories progressively to organic memories is a requi- 
site for great skill, not only in physical dexterity, but 
in all the higher forms of well-adapted mental achieve- 
ment.
-P-A-G-E-269
  THE LEARNING PROCESS 251 
5. Learn to forget the useless (Forgetting). 
CoroLttary: Keep your card-catalogue system alive. 
Dead timber and the useless accumulate constantly. 
When an item in your card catalogue has completely 
outlived its usefulness you remove it. The business 
of life has its temporary transactions, whose records it 
would be wasteful to thumb every day after the transac- 
tions are closed. The efficient man is the man who 
lives in the present. It takes deliberate will power to let 
the “dead past bury its dead.”’ As our first rule of 
memory was “‘ Dare to be ignorant,” so our last may well 
be, with all the emphasis we can lay upon it, “‘ Learn to 
forget.” 
Forgetting: Learn to forget the useless 
Transference: Transfer to organic memory 
Expression: Express recognition in action 
Reinstatement: Reinstate the original setting 
Recognition: Recognize the memory image 
6. Practice. 
The power of a warm, rich, and serviceable conscious 
memory is nature’s generous gift to all normal men. Prac- 
tice does not create anything ; it merely uses and strength- 
ens. All that has been said of practice should be accepted 
in this sense: use, enjoy, and it will become and remain 
your possession. The warning of psychology is: Waste 
not. So from every side of our pyramid we reach the 
one all-binding capstone, Practice. 
To summarize as an aid in recall, let us name the rules 
in the order given. ao

The reader who has hung the above rules upon the 
catchword pegs or horns may now review in realistic im- 
agery the legends on the four faces of the pyramid-ped- 
estal, and see the whole crowned with the heroic figure of 
serviceable memory. 
As the steps of the pyramid are merely parts of the same 
solid structure, so impression, association, recall, and 
recognition are merely aspects of the one complex process 
of memory; the principtes here outlined are more far- 
reaching and interrelated than this statement would sug- 
gest. * : 
Who yearns to mount the pyramid? Everybody. 
Who will mount it? Very, very few. And thisisnatural 
and perhaps right. Most of us have decided, mainly 
through acts of negligence, that the systematic improve- 
ment of memory. is not worth what it costs. But that

    does not alter the psychological fact that memory can be 
improved, nor does it alter the responsibility for its im- 
provement. 
Let us not blame our parents for the inheritance of a 
weak memory. All normal persons have sufficient ca- 
pacity if only they will use it. To be concrete, the aver- 
age man does not use-above ten per cent of his actual 
inherited capacity for memory. He wastes the ninety 
per cent by violating natural laws of remembering. 
Memory is very responsive to training ; it is a fit object 
for conservation. But what most of us attain or con- 
serve is what nature in her beneficent provision pre- 
serves for us despite our gross negligence and squan- 
dering extravagance. 
Exercise. — After having written the memory test, reéxamine the 
rules critically and decide how, many of them are worth putting into 
practice for the rest of your life. 
1 The result of the memory test would, of course, have been better had all 
the rules been known and practised from the beginning of the chapter. Would 
it not be worth while to master these principles at this stage and apply them in 
the study of lessons hereafter? To do so will require a special effort, but it 
will be a good investment.

  CHAPTER XVIII 
MEMORY 
Point of view. — Memory may be viewed scientifically 
from three points of view: (1) as present consciousness 
of past events with recognition; (2) as including with 
this conscious memory all subconscious processes of the 
same kind; and (3) as a neural law of adaptation in 
living tissue. From the third point of view, it is gen- 
erally held that every impulse leaves a trace; from the 
second point of view it is maintained that, other things 
being equal, what is demonstrated of conscious processes 
holds also for subconscious processes. While our de- 
scription will be primarily in terms of conscious memory, 
we shall constantly bear in mind the application to the 
subconscious and the fact that, underlying all mental 
aspects, is the physical fact of neural disposition as in- 
volved in association.! 
ELEMENTS OF MEemory 
Conscious memory, as defined by James, is “ the 
knowledge of an event or fact of which in the meantime 
we have not been thinking, with the additional conscious- 
1 Order of Topics.— It may have surprised you to find that the chapter on 
applied psychology of memory should have preceded the present one on “pure” 
psychology of memory. The reason for this is twofold. In the first place, we 
have already studied impression in sensory experience, images, associations, the 
neural basis of memory, and organic memory as instinct. In the second place, 
training furnishes a happy device for bringing into concrete experience a some- 
what systematic illustration of how memory works. It remains for us in the 
present chapter then merely to gather odds and ends in a general review of the 
memory process to which we have been introduced in the last few chapters. 
254
-P-A-G-E-273
MEMORY 255 
ness that we have thought or experienced it before.” 
Memory even so narrowly defined is really a group of 
processes which we recognize in four major steps: im- 
pression, retention, reproduction, and recognition. 
Impression. — Impression is really not a part of the 
memory process proper, as it constitutes the original 
experience, such as perception, action, feeling or thought ; 
but no adequate account of memory can be given with- 
out taking it into account, because the-mode of impres- 
sion determines the survival value, particularly in or- 
ganized memory of serviceable facts. 
“Every impression leaves a trace. The meaning 
of this statement may be made clear by an analogy. 
An earthquake disturbs a body of water violently; a 
ship plying at the surface changes the distribution of the 
water; a single drop falling makes an impression, how- 
ever small, and the continued falling of drop after drop 
causes great changes in the level and distribution of the 
water, but no drop disappears without a trace. Just 
so the conscious, strong, and relevant impressions make 
marked changes in the psychophysical organism; but 
the stream of processes in this organism is made up in 
large part of merged ‘drops,’ the countless faint im- 
pressions, each of which, though losing its identity, 
enters into the composition and cumulative flow ofthe 
ever-changing stream. 
“Sentience, affection, skill, and character all rest 
upon an incomparably broader foundation of fact than 
that of the sum total of consciously experienced im- 
pressions. We are seldom judged by our intentions 
or the attitudes we strike; we are judged by the atti- 
tudes in which we are least concerned with the effect 
we are to produce. When we judge a man we seldom 
develop a rational opinion of him from an indifferent
-P-A-G-E-274
256 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
point of view; on the contrary, we first fall into an atti- 
tude toward him, and then proceed to picture him to 
ourselves from that point of view, usually without be- 
ing aware of the existing bent of mind or of the impres- 
sions which caused it. This is true not only in friend- 
ships and aversions, but as well in our rich life of feeling- 
attitudes toward objects, events, ideas, and ideals in 
life. The countless inflowing impressions have left their 
traces, which exist as forces or tendencies; our attitudes 
are in large part the resultants of such forces. 
“ At the present moment your consciousness is prop- 
erly centered upon the reading of this chapter or upon 
some reflections suggested by it. But at this very time 
there is a mass of visual, auditory, taste, smell, tem- 
perature, strain, and pain stimuli pressing in upon you. 
Every one leaves a trace. You feel with compunction 
that your mind is wandering. There is a fleeting array 
of undifferentiated ideas and impressions passing through 
you. (iver one leaves a trace; it changes the growing 
mind $0 that the mental content is different from what 
it would have been if any one of these impressions had 
not eee 
“Tt is one Of the great blessings of nature that so few 
of these traces reach consciousness in the act of impres- 
sion, and that still fewer are ever consciously recalled 
as individual impressions. Rationality, endurance, dis- 
crete cognition, and action rest upon the fact that con- 
sciousness is selective, personal, purposive, and of par- 
ticular things. And again, it is fortunate that the 
elimination is automatic and, therefore, easy and effective. 
If we should be conscious of all impressions strong enough 
to reach consciousness in a given hour we should become 
mentally wrecked. So sensitive is our psychophysical 
organism that it registers everything, and so wonderfully 
are we organized that we can utilize stored-up experience 
with but slight expenditure of conscious effort.” (The 
author’s ‘“ Psychology in Daily Life ’’)
-P-A-G-E-275
   MEMORY 257 
Retention. — We must not think of the mind as a 
storehouse of experiences such as images, ideas, thoughts, 
feelings or acts; nor may we regard the brain as a file of 
negatives, any one of which may be printed from at 
will; yet something is retained in enormous quantities 
and is available for reproduction or reconstruction of 
our former experience. 
What is the nature of this “ trace ”’ that is retained? 
Retention is entirely a matter of association, as already 
discussed both from the psychological and physiological 
f view. From the physiological point of view 
we call retention a neural disposition. - 
“Qne’s native retentiveness.is-perhaps unchangeable. 
It will now “appear clear that all improvement of the 
memory lies in the line of elaborating the associates of 
each of the several things to be remembered. No 
amount of culture. would seem capable of modifying a 
man’s. general retentiveness. This is a physiological 
quality, given once for all with his organization, and 
which he can never hope to change. It differs no doubt 
in disease and health; and it is a fact of observation 
that it is better in fresh and vigorous hours than when 
we are fagged or ill. \We may say, then, that a man’s 
native tenacity will fluctuate somewhat with his hy- 
giene, and that whatever amount of intellectual exercise 
is bracing to the general tone and nutrition of the brain 
will also be profitable to the general retentiveness. But 
more than this we cannot say; and this, it is obvious, 
is far less than most people believe. When schoolboys 
improve by-practice-in-ease_of learning by heart, the 
improvement will, Iam sure, be always found to reside 
in the mode of f study of the particular piece (due to the 
greater interest, the’ greater suggestiveness, the generic 
similarity with other pieces, the more sustained atten-

258 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
tion, etc., etc.), and not at all to any enhancement of the 
brute retentive power.”’ (James) 
“ The controversy started by this statement of James 
a generation ago has not yet died down. His statement 
means that each of us is born with a set brain capacity 
which cannot be improved by training. And he was 
right in the same sense that we can say that a farmer 
buys a certain kind of soil; it may be the richest alluvial 
soil or it may be the sand of the desert. Suitable 
cultivation may do wonders with a given soil, but aside 
from temporary fertilizing, skill in adapting vegetation 
to the resources of the soil, and the supply of its needs, 
the original capacity of the soil remains fairly constant 
in its class. But the superficial critic has said for thirty 
years: ‘Behold the fact of phenomenal improvement 
in retentiveness.’ 
“ The explanation lies in the fact that nature is pro- 
lific.. Every normal person is born with a brain capacity 
for memory far beyond what is ever developed. In- 
deed, it is safe to say that any normal child or adult 
beyond middle age, may increase his memory by proper 
training at least tenfold, and often much more, and 
still not utilize his capacity to the limit. Such improve- 
ment in the use of a given brain capacity is no evidence 
of improving the capacity; it is nothing but evidence 
of acquired ability to use the available instrument or 
capacity. 
“In judging memory we must not confuse native 
capacity and specialized skill. Most of our exhibitions 
of unusual memory are specialized skills. Pillsbury, 
the chess player, blindfolded, played simultaneously 
fourteen games of chess, two games of whist, and two 
games of checkers, and carried on a running conversa- 
tion, while usually winning the games. It seemed to 
be easy for him and gave witnesses a feeling of uncanny 
weirdness ; yet Pillsbury had only an ordinary memory 
in other respects. He had used his inborn capacity
-P-A-G-E-277
MEMORY 259 
to most excellent advantage by developing a specific 
skill for which he had natural aptitude and in which 
he displayed indefatigable patience. Memory is not 
a single faculty or capacity; it is several capacities, 
each with definite aspects, and may be developed into 
countless varieties of ability and skill.” (The author’s 
“ Psychology of Musical Talent ’’) 
Reproduction. — Just as in sensory experience only 
a few of the infinite number of impressions reach the 
level of consciousness, so in memory only an infinitesi- 
mally small part of the available traces are reproduced 
in consciousness. Those that reach this level are recog- 
nized as conscious memories. A vastly larger number 
of traces are reproduced at the level of the subconscious, 
modifying all forms of cognition, feeling, and action. 
Indeed the most vital, the most serviceable traces appear 
in the more or less complete automatism, as in our normal, 
easy, graceful, skilful action. ~ 
Recognition. — Organic memory consists of only the 
first three stages — impression, retention, reproduction. 
It culminates in its reproduction in action or in the un- 
conscious modification of mental content. Organic mem- 
ories are of two types, — the instinctive, which are the 
organic race memories, and the habitual, which issue 
from the associations acquired in the lifetime ofan indi- 
vidual. These two forms of memory we have considered, 
in part, in two preceding chapters. Conscious memory 
inheres essentially in the fourth stage, recognition. To 
remember an event in this sense of recognition, four 
things are essential. There must be (1) awareness of 
the event, (2) awareness of self, (3) conscious location 
of the event in time and space, and (4) belief. 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  200 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
The memory of an event may have the appearance 
of being instantaneous and yet may imply a rich inter- 
play of conflicting processes. (1) The event may ap- 
pear in word imagery denoting the scene heard, seen, 
or spoken, or the written name of the event. This, 
however, soon gives way to images of the thing or event 
itself or some mode of symbolizing it. This imagery 
usually comes first in the dominant sense and is accom- 
panied or followed by associated images through other 
senses. There is rivalry between this image of the actual 
event and intruding images of associated facts for a focal 
place in consciousness. (2) All this imagery arouses re- 
actions, particularly a rich play of reflexes, momentary 
glimpses of yourself through sensation, feeling and im- 
pulses which result in a feeling of “this is mine.” 
(3) The original setting plays up in successive details as 
to representation of time and place in such a way as to 
make you aware of the location of this event in time and 
place while representing yourself as acting at that time 
and in that place. (4) You may experience uncertainty 
and hesitation. Your correct first impressions pene- 
trate deeply and supply missing features. All this done, 
there gradually grows on you a certain degree of belief 
in the fidelity of the experience. 
EXERCISE. — Write an introspective account describing fully the 
character of your mental processes for each of the above four stages 
in your present recall of the laws of recognition from the last 
chapter. Do not look it up, but depend entirely on memory.

tative. Reports on such experiments fill many volumes 
in the technical literature from the points of view of pure 
psychology, abnormal psychology, comparative psychol- 
ogy, social psychology, psychoanalysis, physiological and 
brain psychology, education, industry, art, and anthro- 
pology. In each of these fields memory presents numer- 
ous problems for experiment and these have been at- 
tacked by diverse methods. In general they may be 
grouped under two topics, the learning process and dis- 
turbances of memory. 
Methods of experiment. — Among the methods em- 
ployed are the following : (1) By the method of controlled 
introspection, such facts as types of images, the réle of 
images, the transformation of the image in recall, the con- 
trol of images, the réle of kinesthetic sensation, the 
character of associative bonds, and the feeling of belief 
in recognition have been investigated. (2) The method 
of recognition in objective measurement is used in much 
exact work: for example, a list of ten words is shown 
for ten seconds and then another list is shown containing 
some of the same words and the observer is required to 
identify those that are the same. (3) In the method of 
reproduction the observer is required to reproduce the 
remembered material as in writing, speech, or other 
form of action. (4) The method of conditioned reflex, 
now the principal method in behaviorism, registers 
memory entirely in terms of action involving reflexes. 
(5) Brain surgery and experimental physiology in the 
localization of functions of the brain bring remarkable 
opportunities for the analysis of memory functions by 
showing that under certain conditions disturbances at a 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
  262 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
specific point in the brain produce corresponding dis- 
turbances of memory. (6) By the method of psycho- 
analysis, systematic analysis of the structure and func- 
tion of latent memory, insight is given into the memory 
of processes below the level of consciousness, particularly 
in cases involving mental disturbances due to suppressed 
memories. (7) The methods of abnormal psychology, 
as in hypnosis and other trance states or in alterations 
of personality, have been particularly fruitful in the 
experimental analysis of subconscious memory. 
Experimental problems. — The first rule in experi- 
mental procedure is to vary one condition at a time 
under control and keep all other factors constant, as 
nearly as possible. By the methods named, such fac- 
tors as the following have been isolated and controlled 
in reasonable detail: the evolution of memory from its 
first emergence in unicellular animals to the highest ; 
the development of memory in infancy through matu- 
rity and its decline in senility; the establishment of 
memory types; the measurement of individual differ- 
ences; the reliability and unreliability of memory under 
certain conditions of action, report, or testimony; the 
strengthening of memory through stimulation, sugges- 
tion, and countless artifices and devices of training ; 
the lowering of memory through depressors, such as high 
altitude and fatigue; the course of dissociation of mem- 
ory in certain mental diseases, particularly in the amne- 
sias; the analysis of memory genius; the develop- 
ment of extraordinary memory power and skill through 
mnemonic systems, intensified effort, and a persistent 
training.

Necessity of first-hand experiment. — The present 
and the three preceding chapters have been written in 
the light of, and as an informal embodiment of, the find- 
ings in such experimental procedure. It is impossible 
here to take up the matter in technical detail. How- 
ever, for any serviceable understanding and apprecia- 
tion of the nature and significance of experiment in this 
subject it is essential that you should perform some ex- 
periments under original control. The modern instruc- 
tor in psychology has an abundance of such at hand. 
What the experiment shall be depends upon the equip- 
ment and local interests.1 _ 
The significance of individual differences. — Modern 
insight into the nature, types, and enormous magni- 
tude of individual differences in memory places respon- 
sibility and furnishes aid in the selection and guidance of 
personnel for all sorts of occupations in which specific 
facts of memory are a condition of success. The time is 
passing for the selection of personnel without regard for 
native fitness for the occupation and no one should be 
more interested in such an inventory than the young 
person who is about to enter a trade, an art, a profes~ 
sion, or any other occupation in which some form of 
memory is an essential asset. 
Transfer of training. — If you learn to perform an act 
of skill with one hand, does any of the acquired ability 
transfer to the other hand? Will thorough training in

interpretation in the memory experiment with material readily available.

Latin make you a better student in mathematics? Are 
there certain forms of learning that may be accepted as 
discipline for all learning? In what sense can we have 
transfer of training? These problems have been illu- 
minated by experiment in recent years only to raise 
many related questions. 
Present opinion may perhaps be best summarized in 
the vote of eight of the leading American Psychologists 
upon the following propositions : 
I. Transfer of training is an established fact, and may 
be positive, négatiye, or zero. 
II. The true amount of transfer from one field to 
another has not yet been found by experiment on account 
of one or more of the following handicaps : 
(a) The maturity or previous training of the subjects 
tested. 
(b) The absence from the training of the factors most 
favorable to transfer. 
(c) The inadequacy of the tests to measure the traits 
sought. 
     III. It is a reasonable inference that a substantial , 
amount of transfer to some related field would be found 
by an adequate test, if'in teaching children, emphasis 
were placed upon the trait which the selected subject 
was more capable of developing, and if the factors con- 
trolling transfer were present in the training. 
IV. Even if no great amount of transfer of training 
to any one field should ever be found by experiment, it 
would still be true that if small amounts of transfer of a 
valuable trait extended to a large number of fields, the
-P-A-G-E-283
MEMORY 265 
sum total of all these small amounts would be a very 
valuable educational asset. 
V. Negative transfer or interference may take place 
when in the training of a certain trait auxiliary habits are 
cultivated which have to be broken down before the trait 
can function in a new situation. 
VI. Zero transfer may occur when the habits tending 
to interfere and those tending to transfer just offset 
each other. 
VII. There are elements of situations so fundamental 
in their nature that they occur again and again in con- 
nection with almost anything else. Special training 
with these elements has general value.

  CHAPTER ie 
IMAGINATION AND PLAY 
IMAGINATION 
Our discussion of this topic may now be made very 
brief, because memory and imagination are so closely 
telated that an account of one process covers the account 
of the other, particularly as regards the fundamental 
concepts of mental images, association, reflexes, instinct, 
and neural theory, which are in principle analogous in 
the two processes. Likewise, later chapters throw light 
on imagination as they do on memory. 
Imagination and memory. — Memory represents the 
past, the old, the fact; imagination points to the ficti- 
tious, the new, the future. To the extent that a mental 
picture of the past object, situation, or event conveys 
the impression that it represents an actual fact, whether 
truly or falsely, it is a memory. To the extent that it 
carries the conviction that something new has been 
created in the present mental act, it is imagination. The 
distinction between memory and imagination is there- 
fore not primarily that of “ faithfulness to fact’? but 
rather one of belief or conviction. There is a gradual 
transition from organic memory as “ faithful reproduc- 
tion,” through all degrees of fidelity in “ production,” 
up to pure imagination as a creation of something new. 
266
-P-A-G-E-285
  IMAGINATION AND PLAY 267 
Our common experiences of memory and imagination lie 
between these two extremes and are blends of reproduc- 
tion and production. 
The formulation of a theory, the molding of a figure, 
the writing of an epic, the planning of next year’s va- 
cation, are all acts of imagination; but the success of 
each depends upon faithfulness to facts; that is to say, 
imagination in the large bulk is representation and re- 
quires the highest kind of fidelity to facts. It is the 
newness of the design, the newness of the arrange- 
ment or the ideal that makes it imagination. But the 
new creation always rests upon a discriminating mem- 
ory. 
Imagination is therefore defined as.the process of 
forming new ideal combinations, which depends on rela- 
tive absence of objective restriction and considerable 
freedom of subjective selection. 
Passive and active imagination. — There is a gradual 
transition from the most spontaneous, fanciful, fantas- 
tic, and unrestricted imagination which we call fantasy 
up to the most rigorous, logical, and labored creative 
imagination. The one extreme is passive, the other 
active; but one gradually blends into the other. Inspi- 
ration, for example, in all its various aspects, usually de- 
notes a spontaneous outburst; but it comes only to 
those who have labored hard in paving the way. This 
is the testimony of all great artists and inventors. On 
the other hand, fantasy is the untrained and unrestrained 
imagination which represents lassitude and irresponsi- 
bility. 
Yet imagination calls for a sort of abandon. The
-P-A-G-E-286
  268 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
play of the child and youth makes possible a larger life 
than the dull activities afford only to the extent that 
the player loses himself or, as we should say, finds him- 
self in the realism of the play attitude. The exercise 
of curiosity in this play attitude gradually develops 
into free self-expression for the pleasure of self-expres- 
sion and self-extension in the attitude of investigation, 
invention, and creative art. But imagination also plays 
the humbler réles in vivid perception, lifelike memory, 
rich feeling, meaningful thought and action. It is 
imagination that furnishes the color and glow. 
Imagination types. — The sensuous type is charac- 
terized by luxuriant and realistic imagery in terms of 
which experience is created and re-created. Instead 
of recalling experience in a matter-of-fact way, one en- 
dowed with this imagination at once reconstructs ex- 
perience in images more or less fantastic, conventional- 
ized, idealized, and enriched, and often so molded as to 
embody his feelings, biases, and aspirations or fears. 
He lives in a world of the senses and enjoys a sort of 
abandon and luxurious freedom from restrictions of 
the commonplace. It is the life of the impressionist, 
an effervescent life of the moment, reverberant in sen- 
sations and images. 
The intellectual type is ordinarily spoken of as the 
scientific or philosophical imagination. Creation takes 
the form of propositions, theories, postulates, and logi- 
cal ideas more or less concretely and directly represented 
in images. The sensory and imaginal elements are rela- 
tively in abeyance and the process is cool and deliberate, 
For the reason that it deals consistently with large
-P-A-G-E-287
  IMAGINATION AND PLAY 269 
units of thought, this is the master form of imagination ; 
the feeling involved is placid but may be intense. 
The sentimental imagination, often called the artis- 
tic, is characterized by its tendency to idealize experi- 
ence in terms of the higher sentiments. Objects and 
events assume meaning with reference to remote ideals, 
or sanctions, such as harmony, unity, pleasure, or the 
opposites of these. The world is a world of truth, good- 
ness, and beauty, or their opposites, rather than the 
humdrum of the common man’s experience; experience 
is thought of in terms of ideals and feelings rather than 
of events and things. 
The impulsive imagination is that which results in 
display of feeling and the arousal of the emotion in others. 
It lacks logic, poise in sentiment, and continuity of effort. 
It often results in great creations, as it taps the deeper re- 
sources of life under the stimulus of great emotion; 
but it tends to be sporadic and is wanting in cogency 
and continuity. 
The motor type of imagination, sometimes called the 
practical or mechanical imagination, lacks the appear- 
ance of mental creation and often suggests the effort of 
the plodder. It appears in the person whose interests 
are practical and who can foresee only as he gradually 
works out situations by doing. It is characterized by 
persistence in effort, serviceable forethought, and the 
tendency to achieve practical success. 
To these may be added the balanced imagination — 
that which includes each and all of the type-traits in 
well-developed symmetry. For further detail of de- 
scription we may designate various combinations, such
-P-A-G-E-288
  270 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
as impressional-sentimental; the relative strength may 
be designated throughout by such adjectives as weak, 
moderate, and strong. 
Pray 
Play is free self-expression for the pleasure of expres- 
sion; or, as Ruskin puts it, “an exertion of body or 
mind made to please ourselves, and with no determined 
end.” The introduction of the natural history method 
in psychology has transformed the conception of play — 
its nature, its function, its evolution, and its meaning; 
and, with the deeper significance discovered in the pro- 
jection of our imagination into play, comes a broader in- 
terpretation of education, knowledge, industry, moral- 
ity, art, and religion.' 
Imagination, as we have seen, enters into all levels 
of normal mental life, but finds its free outlet in play as 
distinguished from work or task. To throw some light 
on the function of imagination, we shall trace briefly 
in this chapter the nature and réle of play in daily life 
of child as well as adult. 
A preparation for life in childhood. — What is the child 
doing? He is exercising curiosity in overcoming diffi- 
culty. That is the law of growth. The senses and 
muscles develop through play. Touching, groping, and 
grasping; rattling, babbling, and shouting; visually pur- 
suing, inspecting, and analyzing; tasting, sucking, and 
smelling ; pulling and pushing, and countless other sen- 
sory impressions with appropriate responses and the pro- 
duction of stimuli for these grow gradually out of semi-

-P-A-G-E-289
  IMAGINATION AND PLAY 271 
random movements and simple reflexes and are progres- 
sively transformed into higher forms of imagination and 
skill. Through such exercise of curiosity, the control of 
the senses and the muscles is progressively adapted, result- 
ing in precision, enlargement of meaning, and mastery 
of response not only for these situations but in general 
control of body and mind. 
The child begins his training in the use of tools and 
acquisition of mastery, both mental and physical, by 
dropping playthings and throwing things helter skelter 
and thus gets his first practice in the skill later re- 
quired for projecting himself by a blow or a throw and 
reciprocal movement of catching and parrying, as in all 
forms of ball games. He learns to project his person- 
ality through the senses and muscles as they are progres- 
sively coérdinated. When he later leads the dog, the 
kite, or his own playmate, he is pursuing the pleasure 
of being a cause and is extending his own personality 
through a progressive mastery of his mental and physi- 
cal organism. 
The higher mental powers are normally developed 
in close connection with the use of the senses and the 
muscles, for the child throws his whole being into play. 
He is ever responsive and play is the main avenue for 
the free outpouring of his various selves in action. His 
memory, his reasoning, his feelings, emotions, and senti- 
ments grow and are strengthened and refined and made 
serviceable through play. The free and whole-hearted 
expression of his instincts through play transforms and 
fashions them in reaction to the environment, thus 
building character. The social attitude and esthetic 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
  272 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
nature of the child are peculiarly dependent upon play 
for their normal growth, for the child at play reproduces, 
on each successive level of his development, the indus- 
trial, social, moral, and intellectual and artistic life of 
the adult. 
There is a gradual transition from the child’s racket 
and howl to the appreciation and grasp of music in the 
adult. The analytic instinct of curiosity which moves 
the child to tear things apart and examine them is a 
part of the making of the scientific experimenter, the 
artist, and the philosopher. The collecting instinct 
which fills the urchin’s pockets with pebbles and bugs 
later fills our storehouses, museums, art galleries, theaters, 
and churches. 
Warfare and love, fiendish fight and self-sacrifice, obe- 
dience and defiance, the comic and the tragic, regener- 
ation and degeneration, domestic occupation and the 
spirit of venture — in all these the child lives at his own 
level, and gradually approaches the stern adult realities, 
taught and trained, hardened and softened, warmed and 
cooled, roused and rationalized, through these very- en- 
gagements in play, which without break or loss of their 
original character gradually blend into the duties, re- 
sponsibilities, opportunities, and achievements of adult 
life. 
Thus the body develops more through the exercise of 
play than through work. Sensory experience gradually 
acquires associations and responses, comes under control 
of voluntary attention, and becomes differentiated and 
serviceable through play; memory, imagination, con- 
ception, judgment, and reasoning are whetted, strength-
-P-A-G-E-291
  IMAGINATION AND PLAY 273 
ened, and enriched through their exercise in play; the 
effective life becomes sensitive, adapted, balanced, and 
serviceable through play; habits are formed, instincts 
developed, impulses trained and brought under control, 
streams of subconscious activities crystallized, and the 
power of attention disciplined through play. In short, 
play is the principal instrument of growth. It is safe to 
conclude that, without play, there would be no normal 
adult cognitive life; without play, no healthful devel- 
opment of affective life; without play no full develop- 
ment of the power of the will. 
This view does not deny the value of work in the form 
of drudgery, routine task, and rigid discipline as a means 
of development, a duty — even a pleasure. It simply 
stresses the fact that, all in all, play holds the larger sway. 
Nature has made the period of infancy and childhood 
long in order that the fruits of child play might be cor- 
respondingly great. It is well for the adult director 
of the child’s activities to realize the largeness of the 
task of the child; to realize that normal life may be 
crushed by depriving youth of the rights and opportu- 
nities of play; to realize the necessity of encouragement 
in defeat, of applause in victory, of approval in success, 
and to exercise sympathetic and prudent selection in 
shaping the native childish impulses for the making of 
the man through play. 
Continuous throughout normal life. — Free stimu- 
lation of the senses is often a means of play. Normal 
adults play with sweetmeats, sunlight, odors, colors, 
forms, temperatures, strains, and even pain. Remi- 
niscence is one of the charms of life. The effective novel- 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
  274 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
ist lives his characters. It is the play illusion that makes 
poetry. The theater is by nature as well as by name a 
playhouse. Idlings, romance, and invention, as crea- 
tions of fancy, are play. A score of men engage in action 
on a football field, while thousands replay the game on 
the bleachers. Wit and humor, mental contests, even 
when they occur as a part of work, exhibit the aspect of 
play. The musician “ plays” frequently as a form of 
free self-expression for the pleasure of expression. Even 
misery, tragedy, misanthropy, as well as triumphant 
victory and applause, are exhibitions of this free self- 
expression. Sport is scientific play; witness hunting, 
racing, flying, and gambling. The best recreations carry 
the mark of sport and serve the purpose of human de- 
velopment. Dancing and all social games weave a tie 
that binds the social body into one. Fishing, skating, 
riding, and golf exercise parts of the mind and body that 
have not been exercised in labor. Witnessing arhuse- 
ments and games enables us to live in images the more 
strenuous realities of diversified action. 
Adult play. — Sport holds its sway only so long as 
there is room for advancing achievement; one sport 
follows another in answer to the needs of maturing man. 
Plays, like serious occupations and the associations of 
life, change with the growth of the individual. Rec- 
reation, to be effective, must possess an engaging charm 
in the form of fresh impressions, novel associations, and 
new outlets for activity. Even rest serves its purpose 
only in so far as its form is progressively adapted to the 
changing needs of the constitution. There are visions 
to be seen, inspirations to be received, ideals to be set
-P-A-G-E-293
  IMAGINATION AND PLAY 275 
aglow, sympathies to be cultivated, emotions to be re- 
fined, dreams of achievements to be enjoyed, riddles of 
life to be solved by the proof of experience. While 
adult man pursues these objects through systematic 
efforts and tasks, much of his learning and adaptation 
for the larger life comes through the exercise of the play 
impulse and through living in the play attitude. The 
man or the woman who has ceased to play is intellectually 
dead. 
In all favorable occupations much that goes by the 
name of work is done in the spirit of play; and, con- 
versely, much that goes by the name of play is downright 
drudgery. Witness many of the “ social duties ” which 
have the appearance of play but are often done as pain- 
ful tasks. The greater part of life is neither wholly play 
nor wholly work. The scientific study of play will 
substitute a large number of specific terms for the vague 
term “ play,” as has been done in the case of the term 
“memory.” There need, therefore, be no dispute in 
the future as to what is work and what is play, for dis- 
cussion will center upon the analysis, description, and 
explanation of specific instincts, impulses, associations, 
attitudes, and actions characteristic of play, regardless 
of whether they occur in play or in other activity. 
Primitive man lived relatively free from thoughtful 
care; the child, though endowed with a keen imagi- 
nation, is disposed to tread in the footsteps of his distant 
ancestors. Civilization has modified this tendency in 
two ways: it has established a sense of responsibility, a 
prudent forethought in the division of labor, and a sym- 
pathetic effort to make advancement ; on the other hand, 
 
-P-A-G-E-294
  276 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY | 
it has opened up vast avenues of possibilities, not only for 
playful expression in industry, art, science, education, 
and religion, but also in the increase of means and avenues 
for pure play. While primitive man was essentially a 
playing animal, cultured man has vastly more play 
interests than had his remote ancestor. Indeed, play 
goes with greatness and with a strenuous life. To Mr. 
Roosevelt the wilds of Africa and the courts of Europe 
formed a continuous, fascinating playground in which 
he played with all his heart, and all his surroundings 
played their gayest for him while the world proclaimed 
him a leader in political thought and action. 
Play as self-realization.— A most vital element in 
the feeling of self-realization is the experience of growth. 
Men, like trees, die when they cease to grow. We must 
limit ourselves to bare mention of some of the most sig- 
nificant traits of play in its normal function in this free 
self-expression. 
Play preserves the racial inheritance. As we have 
seen, man has the instinct to do everything that he can 
do; and the possession of capacity carries with it the 
tendency to use that capacity. Work and other neces- 
sities of daily life develop a relatively small part of our 
instinctive resources. Groups of instinctive capacities 
would be lost were it not for the liberal education of 
play; for play develops those traits which have not been 
drawn out by the spur of necessity. It elevates even 
asitlevels. Cultured life is artificial, narrow, specialized, 
and intensive; and this is indeed a condition for great 
achievement. But play develops the possible man, 
rather than the man of choice or condition. Thus play
-P-A-G-E-295
  IMAGINATION AND PLAY 277 
conserves through use the inheritance from millions of 
years of growth. 
Play represents a reversion to type. The tendency in 
play is to fall back upon the elemental. Whatever 
artifices of war may be devised, fighting plays will al- 
ways gravitate back toward the simple form of direct 
bodily contact, be it with fellow-men, beasts, or the 
forces of nature. It has been suggested that boys climb 
trees and swim in response to survivals of these specific 
activities traceable to distant arboreal or aquatic an- 
cestry. This assumption is unnecessary, for boys come 
into this world with limbs fitted for climbing and swim- 
ming; trees are common and inviting for climbing, and 
the water is a great “temptation” to the boy. The 
tree and the water challenge curiosity, bravery, and ex- 
citement. In this manner the whole boy, the whole 
man, naturally gravitates toward self-expression in ele- 
mental forms of behavior. 
Play engenders a sense of freedom. Witness in play 
the freedom in movement, imagination, and joy; and, 
in the free desire for mastery, freedom is the goal. With 
power as with duty, in a great civilization come restric- 
tion and strain to millionaire, ruler, or servant. He 
therefore turns to diversion in play for freedom for the 
expression of his heart cravings. Whether in specula- 
tion, sport, art, invention, adventure, social contact, 
recreation, or rest, the sense of freedom which play 
generates is an alluring charm. 
Play fascinates. It attracts, engages, and holds the in- 
dividual in a state tending toward elation. This tend- 
ency, when it is real play and not mere social labor or
-P-A-G-E-296
  278 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
conformity, carries the dancer away in so far as he falls 
into a state of diffused and dreamy consciousness, intox- 
cated by the sense of pleasure, lulled by the rhythmic 
movements, and soothed by the melodious and measured 
flow of music. This element of ardent fascination and 
elation may be seen in some degree in all play — in the 
romping of the infant, in the adolescent mating plays, 
in the sport and adventure of youth, in speculation and 
gambling, or the recreation of the adult. Indeed, in 
this fascination lies a grave danger — the danger of 
overindulgence. 
The satisfaction in being a cause and extending per- 
sonality is one of the compelling motives of play as well 
as one of its direct rewards. This is well illustrated in 
games of competition. In so far as achievement ex- 
presses and reflects our freest ambition, fancy, or ideals, 
it is rated as part of ourselves, of our cherished person- 
alities, and is attributed to self-exertion. 
Play generates a sense of fellowship. Laying aside 
petty differences, interests, and points of vantage, the 
playing group fuses into a common consciousness on a 
plane of equality, with common means, common interests, 
and common pleasures. Play is, therefore, the making 
of the social man. We become like those with whom we 
play. A deep feeling of fellowship is one of the greatest 
human rewards. Referring to the enemy nation in the 
Great War, an Englishman said: ‘We shall be glad to 
work with them, but we cannot play with them.” 
Play is satisfying because it is positive, even aggressive. 
It stands for acquisition, seriousness, and optimism, as 
may be observed in child or adult that has a “ playful
-P-A-G-E-297
  
IMAGINATION AND PLAY 279 
heart ” as opposed to the one who disdains play. The 
feeble-minded play comparatively little. Thus play is 
an expression of the joy of life, not so much in deliberate, 
systematic play, as in the entry of the play attitude into 
work, or its reflection in nature, truth, and other stern 
realities. Indeed, everything in life presents aspects of 
play to the eyes of the mentally alert. The play atti- 
tude is the most universal medium for the manifestation 
of the sense of freedom and conviction of the worth of life 
when these exist. 
Play is serious and whole-hearted exertion. When we 
work we walk or plod; when we play we skip or run. 
When performing a duty we do as much as is required ; 
but when we play we do all we can. If the football 
players worked as hard at their mental tasks as on the 
football field, there would be fewer failures in the class- 
room. There is a charm in extreme exertion. 
The seriousness of play is one of its fascinations. If 
we join in a game and are not serious or zealous about 
it, we are not playing. Play means to be in the game. 
It is engrossing absorption that drives dull care away. 
Play rests upon make-believe. Liberated from real- 
ities, it accepts the ideal and lives it as reality. Each 
game has its distinctive charm. There is the attraction 
of variety in the free choice of games. It changes from 
day to day, from season to season, and in a progressive 
order from one game to another. The moments of su- 
preme satisfaction, the moments of highest realization 
and appreciation of life, come from activities which are 
most conspicuously characterized by play attitudes — 
either from play pure and simple, or from work in which

play-motives dominate. We all have our work, our 
set tasks and duties; but those of us who get the most 
out of life are they whose work would be their preferred 
play, quite apart from its pursuit as a means of liveli- 
hood. Conversely, the truest and most fortunate are 
those who obtain their relaxation, rest, recreation, stim- 
ulation, and self-expression without making tasks of 
them. The things we do for the pleasure of doing are 
the rewards of life; they are an expression of the freed 
self, the channels of release from the routine of necessity, 
the sources of inspiration, power, and satisfaction. 
This digression from the more systematic treatment of 
our topic may be justified, in that it aims to show that 
acquaintance with play contributes much to the system- 
atic survey of the facts of mind in our daily activities ; 
it adds to the general hold upon life in power of inter- 
pretation which is a part of culture; it indicates at least 
the general direction in which efficiency, through the 
control of natural sources, lies; it adds to the appre- 
ciation of the origin, the complexity, and the beauty of 
human resources and values.

CHAPTER XX 
THOUGHT 
Havinc considered the stages of presentation and rep- 
resentation in the knowing processes we now come to the 
third and highest level, namely, elaboration or thinking. 
It is customary to describe this process under three general 
headings: conception, judgment, and reasoning. 
CONCEPTION 
EXERCISE.— Observing the mental processes involved, write a 
definition of “hat.” Work at it faithfully for a long time until 
you are satisfied that the definition is reasonably adequate. Test 
the definition by observing if it covers all hats and includes nothing 
but hats. 
Formulating a concept.— In writing this definition 
you have formulated a concept. The task proved far 
more difficult than you had anticipated. It left you 
with a lot of uncertainties. In attempting to distinguish 
a hat from all other things and to make your concept 
include all hats, you found trouble with ‘shape, material, 
purpose, use, etc. It was even difficult to exclude such 
things as nightcap, parasol, and kerchief. These diffi- 
culties appeared because you were forced to think. The 
person who does not think often rests in comfortable 
assurance that he knows, for example, what a hat is. To 
some extent, your uncertainties were proportional to the 
seriousness of your thinking. It is in the wrangling with 
these uncertainties that we clarify our concepts and thus 
281 
 
-P-A-G-E-300
  
282 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
arrive at a truer realization of the actual situation, the 
truth. 
Let us now go back over this experience and see what 
happens when we try to clarify a concept for definition. 
No two persons have the same experience but the follow- 
ing is perhaps typical : 
1. Assembling of data. — The word “ hat ” probably 
first flashed into your mind in visual, auditory, and 
kinesthetic imagery. But, whether the word-image 
came first or not, there instantly appeared in imagery a 
veritable millinery show of hats— not only hats but 
wearers of hats, persons in different seasons, different 
climates, different tastes, rich and poor, men and women, 
young and old. Even images of such associated features 
as money, admirers, or sunshine gained recognition. 
You had a-vague awareness of reaction to each of these 
images, particularly in consciousness of likes and dislikes. 
All this happened in so short a time that perhaps you did 
not notice it at all. Your consciousness at the moment 
was perhaps like a snapshot view of a horse-show or a fair. 
The impressions may not have lasted more than a fraction 
of a second each; yet they were impressions of great rich- 
ness and lightning speed of action. This display resulted 
in a confusion ; and, as if to get a fresh start, you possibly 
went back to the image of the word hat again and re- 
minded yourself that your task was to define. 
2. Abstraction. — On the basis of this first impression, 
certain fragments of description presented themselves ; 
for example, to keep the head warm, to keep the head cool, 
an ornament, a headgear, a cup-shaped object. But 
instantly you noticed that some of these terms would
-P-A-G-E-301
THOUGHT 283 
not do because they included too much or too little. 
You therefore proceeded to discard and abstract the irrel- 
evant with the result that you were left with a residue 
of available material for the definition. 
3. Generalization. — You probably first adopted a 
generic designation such as “ an article of wearing apparel 
_for the head’ and then proceeded to-assemble specific 
differences, those characteristics of hat which seemed 
to be true of all hats and yet differentiated it from non- 
hat. This series of specific differentiz served to limit the 
generic designation and give it specific content. The 
results you embodied in a sentence which is the definition 
and constitutes the description of the concept. 
4. Naming. — The process of forming such a concept 
took you back over your entire life experience. The 
concept may be said to represent all that has been in 
your mind in the way of perceptions, memories, and ac- 
tions about hats. All these experiences were recognized in 
such a way as to form a unit — the concept. But this 
process would be a poor tool of thinking. Human beings 
have, therefore, acquired the ability of labeling concepts 
to avoid the necessity of reviewing the entire experience 
each time. The label in this case was the word “ hat.” 
Growth of a concept. — The first time that a child sees 
a book it may mean nothing to him or it may mean some- 
thing to eat, or something to toss or tear. He may see 
the book but he does not know what a book is. This has 
to be learned gradually by acquiring meaning in percep- 
tion. Now, if we make a violent assumption that a child 
sees and uses repeatedly one book and acquires a service- 
able meaning of what it is but does not know that other
-P-A-G-E-302
284 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
books exist and cannot invent any, then his perception, 
his memory, and concept of “book” have the same 
content. But as experience broadens he finds books with 
pictures and no print, print and no pictures, print and 
no cover, cover and no print, books of all kinds of subjects, 
books of all sizes, and styles. For each new experience 
his concept of the class ‘‘book”’ grows. Thus by the time 
he is grown up, the class name book may represent to 
him thousands of particular experiences with books. 
Yet throughout life he finds difficulty in distinguishing 
book from notebook as to possible form, content, purpose, 
and similar features. Is a magazine a book? Isa paged 
calendar a book? What is book-making in the races? 
To meet this growing difficulty he carries on a continuous 
process of rejection and selection of traits of book, reach- 
ing into minute ramifications of detail in precision. He 
rejects the non-essential and selects and generalizes the 
essentials. This double process becomes very complicated 
for, with each restriction of this kind, he whets his power 
of observation and discrimination into more and more 
technical alertness in the recognition of detail, as in the 
labors of the bibliophile, the literary critic, or the book- 
maker. 
Thus the concept is never closed but is a perennial 
growth throughout the plastic life. The child’s curiosity 
becomes the scientist’s passion for systematic inquiry 
and the artist’s inspiration for creative achievement. 
Meaning is progressively woven into the concept. The 
child’s first inquiry is ‘‘ What is this?” “ What is 
the name?” ‘The name satisfies him. Names for con- 
cepts give satisfaction. The name remains constant
-P-A-G-E-303
  THOUGHT 285 
but the meaning changes. The child’s name “ book ” 
and the bibliophile’s name “ book” are formally iden- 
tical and similarly satisfying; but the one represents 
limited, crude experience whereas the other represents 
knowledge gained from a wealth of first-hand critical 
experience. 
The name, however inadequate in itself, is a vital step 
in conception because it serves as a label, tag, or pigeon- 
hole for the vast mass of collected material any part of 
which may be found, recalled, and identified from this 
cue. Each differentiating concept demands a name— 
pamphlet, quarto, monograph. Concepts of a high order 
would be impossible without language. Language, 
therefore, becomes a means of making thought a social 
process. Our perceptions and images are personal ex- 
periences but, through the instrument of words, thinking 
can be shared and thoughts may be conveyed to others. 
The finer meanings, however, remain personal, consisting 
largely in the attitudes, impulses, or organic reactions 
which the associations radiate from the name. 
For the normal alert individual no concept is com- 
pleted or closed during lifetime. Each day may bring 
new possibilities. This is what we mean by education, 
culture, and broadening of experience. Even such con- 
cepts as “hat,” “apple,” “chair,” and “ house ” are 
subject to growth by the revelation of new phases in the 
progress of experience. The old fogy, the biased person, 
and the idiot, are characterized by the fact that their 
concepts are relatively fixed. They are not open to 
new meanings. On the other hand, the uneducated and 
unintelligent are characterized by loose or inadequate con-
-P-A-G-E-304
  286 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
cepts. They not only cannot define ideas, but they do not 
experience correct or adequate ideas. 
As we found with the percept, so with the concept; 
it is what you are. Art and nature, practical affairs and 
events have their true meaning to the individual in terms 
of what he is — his interests and reactions. 
Traits of inadequate concepts. — The correctness of 
this analysis may be shown by pointing out that the 
principal sources of error in thinking, in so far as they 
lodge in the concept, may be grouped about these critical 
stages: (1) The adequacy of meaning in the concept 
depends upon the number of relevant associations it has 
formed. Meaning and thought for a given individual 
are measured mainly in terms of a variety of accurate 
first-hand observations. This is well illustrated in natural 
history. The concept fungus varies in adequacy with the 
extent of the naturalist’s acquaintance with all the possi- 
ble varieties of fungi. Even in cold science real thinking 
must be accomplished through personal means. It can- 
not be done by borrowed concepts, or mere words. Many 
persons are keen objective-minded observers but suffer 
from faithless memory which deprives the concept of 
meanings once possessed. (2) The act of thought consists 
essentially in abstraction and generalization. Many 
persons are keen observers and remember well but lack 
that power of attention to the abstract which is necessary 
for the systematic rejection of the non-essential and selec- 
tion of the essential in “consecutive thinking.” Herein 
lies essentially the difference between common sense in- 
formation, which is unorganized, and scientific knowledge, 
which is organized. (3) The vast mass of our knowledge
-P-A-G-E-305
    
THOUGHT 287 
is mere formal, verbal, borrowed concepts. These are of 
great value and are necessary in the interests of economy. 
They constitute the stock of our information but they are 
not tools for thinking; for the genuine thinking takes 
place in meanings, not words or even images. Elabora- 
tion in terms of borrowed concepts is indeed common but 
it has merely the appearance of thought. It makes but 
little progress. (4) Finally, concepts suffer from inade- 
quate language. If the label is wrong, the goods might 
not be identified or may be missent. The word idea, for 
example, is used correctly in at least nine radically differ- 
ent meanings. The use of such a word in psychology 
is like sending an express package with nine different 
addresses on it. 
Experience of a concept. 
ExercIsE.—In thinking of the concept “book” observe in repeated 
and concentrated trials the images that represent it. Write a brief, 
specific account of the character of this imagery. 
Psychologically there is no new mental unit in the 
concept. beyond what we have found in perception, 
memory, and imagination. The experience of a concept 
is entirely in terms of images, associations, and actions. 
It has often been maintained that the thing present in 
consciousness is a generic image, analogous to a composite 
photograph. Experience shows that such an image lacks 
the stability of a composite picture and looms up in indi- 
vidual features. What we really find, as in the intro- 
spection of the concept “ book,” is image groups flashing 
in kaleidoscopic fashion from feature to feature like the 
scene on the moving picture screen accelerated in motion. 
When I think of ‘‘ book ” it is as if every feature of book 
 
-P-A-G-E-306
  288 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
Thad ever known rushed and clamored for recognition. 
Just as in a real objective situation of such a rush, atten- 
tion fastens upon one image or object at a time in focal 
consciousness with others nearly focal and an increas- 
ing massive impression of the surge of images in the back- 
ground. The first noticed and the most stable are 
usually those containing the commonest or most familiar 
traits, but any of the laws of association may operate to 
force recognition of very specific, rare, or even freakish 
features. Thus, in my own experiment on the concept 
“book”’ amoment ago, the name Omar Khayyam, the ap- 
pearance of a pocket edition, the image of a cynic and epi- 
cure represented as the creator of a type of literature, 
flashed in succession, ruthlessly crowding out the primary 
and more basic images of “book.” A merely verbal image, 
the image of the word, frequently comes first and from this 
all the trains of images radiate. The images may come 
in any or all of the senses. They are not always noted 
as images ; there is rather a feeling of direct consciousness 
of the object. The abstractness of the concept lies in 
the organized array or classification of images in reserve 
of which trait features gain recognition. Often the 
abstractness consists in the acceptance of the mere word 
image, in the selection of the one feature which has 
significance, or in giving the images only marginal 
consciousness. 
Expression of the concept. — The vital meaning of a 
concept is represented in actual organic expression; to 
a large extent meaning is the reaction of the organism. 
Ordinarily this expression is the motor phase or sequel 
of the image. The meaning cost of a book appears in a
-P-A-G-E-307
  THOUGHT 289 
rich play of organic movements expressive of restriction ; 
the meaning beauty in a book stands forth in a train of 
organic movements expressive of delight and well-being 
as well as in attitudes or inceptive tendencies of aggres- 
sion; the meaning of truth of books swells the hier- 
archy of movements expressive of pleasure and repose. 
Large size, small size; purity, impurity of content; li- 
brary, private book; the joy of reading, the boredom of 
a scene; science, poetry ; — the countless meanings that 
may play a réle in the vital concepts appear in impulsive 
movements, reflexes, instinctive and habitual attitudes 
and movements, and have characteristic effects on the 
internal secretions. Hence the meaningfulness of a con- 
cept may be judged by the way it acts. The behaviorist 
is even willing to limit the study of concepts to their ex- 
pression in reflexes. 
Flexibility of concepts. — All definitions are descrip- 
tions of concepts; the formation of an adequate con- 
cept is a preliminary to the formulation of a definition. 
The definition is an amplification of the concept name. 
Ordinarily we think of definitions as being exact. Our 
analysis, however, makes it clear that exactness in most 
definitions is out of the question, for meanings vary with 
individuals, and for the same individual from time to 
time; “deep” meanings are rich and too far-reaching 
to be adequately represented in definition. Yet it is 
definition that makes science. Science is possible when 
we can reduce the personal element to a minimum by 
isolating the traits in the concept so that each may be re- 
peated and described systematically. Even scientific con- 
cepts are limited to the serviceable, and often ignore 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
  290 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
the deeper meanings. Consider, e.g., a definition of 
hope, truth, infinity, love, or even gravitation. 
Knowledge and the concept. — All knowledge takes the 
form of concepts — adequate or inadequate. We have 
concepts for all that we know, real or imaginary, objects, 
relations, actions, ideas, ideals, truths. The concept 
operates in perception representing the past experiences 
to which the present impression is to be referred; like- 
wise in memory, imagination, and suggestion. The con- 
cept is the stabilizing and concrete element in experience. 
But it is particularly in the thought processes that we 
are dependent upon the concept as the concentrated 
unit of thought. The concept is the supreme embodiment 
of the principle of economy in that it represents units of 
unlimited masses of classified experiences. Truth for 
the individual, as for mankind, is a system of growth, — 
ever-changing, serviceable concepts, the embodiment of 
experience. 
JUDGMENT 
To judge is to classify, or to refer a new situation to its 
appropriate concept. It is an interpretation of the facts 
in hand. There must be a new situation, two or more 
alternatives open, and the outcome in doubt. If the 
situation is not new there is nothing to judge; if there is 
no alternative there can be no doubt; if there is no doubt 
there can be no decision. 
The judgment in ordinary thinking has essentially 
the traits of the judgment rendered in the procedure of 
the judgment on the bench: 
“There are three such features: (x) a controversy, 
consisting of opposite claims regarding the same objec-
-P-A-G-E-309
  ‘ THOUGHT 291 
tive situation ; (2) a process of defining and elaborating 
these claims jand of sifting the facts adduced to support 
them; (3) a\final decision, or sentence, closing the par- 
ticular matter in dispute and also serving as a rule or 
principle for deciding future cases.” (Dewey) 
Stages in the judgment. — Let us dissect a judgment 
and observe how these traits are present though stated 
in slightly different terms and order. You open the door 
one winter morning and exclaim, “ This is a blizzard!” 
This judgment was made quickly, almost instantane- 
ously, yet upon close examination we find a number of 
complicated processes more or less expressed. 
1. Clearing the concept. — There is first a clarifying 
of the concepts and percepts involved. “ This ” as per- 
ceived is resistance to the wind, chill, shiver, whiteness of 
snowflakes, darkening of the atmosphere, impact of the 
snow, drifting, swaying of trees, sighing of the wind, etc. 
“ Blizzard ” is a concept representing all your past ex- 
perience and other knowledge of this phenomenon — 
cold, high wind, whistling, white flakes, darkening sky, 
drifting, suffering, various restrictions, etc. The first 
thing in the way of consciousness in this judgment was 
the impression of the present situation with the sugges- 
tion from stage to stage of a concept which may tally with 
this situation. The clarifying process consists in a rigid 
arrangement of facts observed and traits involved in 
the proposed concept with a growing feeling of satisfac- 
tion and conviction of the correctness of the possible 
classification. 
2. Abstraction. — But in the meantime many alterna- 
tives are suggested. Thus arises doubt and the need of 
a critical review. This takes the form of abstraction or 
 
-P-A-G-E-310
  292 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
elimination. One by one the possible rival alternatives 
are slipped off: it is not smoke; it is not the darkness of 
the evening; it is not rain; it isnot hail; itis not a sand- 
storm. Thus you systematically clear the ground by 
reviewing upon critical evidence all the plausible alter- 
natives that came to your mind as answering to a con- 
siderable number of elements in the situation. 
3. Generalization.— The process of selection goes hand 
in hand with rejection, for with each elimination the 
issue becomes more sharp and clear. You are then ina 
position to specify, test, and define the issue: hard, 
white, cold, crystals of snow, whizzing through the air, 
darkening the atmosphere, and forming into drifts, high 
wind as indicated by the swaying of the trees, loud 
whining sounds, and strains upon my body, is a blizzard. 
4. Recognition of meaning. — From the first a recogni- 
tion of meaning has been gradually taking shape. The 
focus of consciousness on image after image or impres- 
sion in the analyzed situation has permitted each of 
these to run its course in feeling, impulse, and organic 
reaction, thus developing a rich appreciation of what it 
all means. If, for example, the element of coldness were 
absent, many of the mental and physical reactions 
would be absent and “blizzard”? would mean some- 
thing different from what it now does. The judgment, 
therefore, results in the enrichment of the same sort of 
meaning that we found in the percept and the concept. 
5. The decision. — The decision classifies. Tagging or 
naming of the conclusion is the judgment expressed in 
language. This also is a cumulative process from the 
very beginning, because every concept when first sug-
-P-A-G-E-311
  THOUGHT 203 
gested came asaname. Thus we say, “ science begins 
with classification and science ends with classification.” 
Sources of error in judgments.— The process of 
judgment is usually long and elaborate in proportion to 
the difficulty to be overcome and the degree of reliabil- 
ity sought. It may, however, approach the instantaneous 
either because the problem is easy or because the judg- 
ment is superficial, inadequate, or incomplete. That 
such factors in the process as those just enumerated exist 
or should exist in even the quickest judgment is well il- 
lustrated if we attempt to locate the sources of error in 
judgment. Just as a study of illusions serves to bring 
out the factors in the perception of space, so the recog- 
nition of types of false judgments serves to make rec- 
ognition of the stages in judgments clearer.   
    
  
EXERCISE. — Write two judgments of each kind representing lodg- 
ment of the error respectively in (1) inadequate perception, (2) false 
memory, (3) faulty elimination, (4) faulty generalization, (5) inad- 
equate realization of meaning, and (6) ambiguity of language. 
“The process of judging is always simple, the results 
of the judgment are always to be found in a concept or 
a type, the direction of the judgment is always in terms 
of the momentary context or purpose. All forms of 
judgment are alike, too, in that their occasion is fur- 
nished by some stimulus. All begin in some stimulus 
and end in a meaning or concept. The concept alone 
is actually conscious. The meaning that is added may 
be a type of the simple kind that makes the object, it may 
be a statement of relative intensity between different 
parts of the total, or it may be an appreciation of the 
value of the presented with reference to some established 
standard. In any case it is the reception of a presented 
stimulus into the unified experience.” (Pillsbury) 
 
-P-A-G-E-312
  294 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
Conditions of judging. — The vast mass of our ra- 
tional knowledge expressed in judgment is not the result 
of judging on the part of the possessor of the knowledge. 
It is ready-made judgments which are handed down. It 
is no discredit to have such but they are not ours and 
they will not mean what they should mean if they were 
ours. The average student wants ready-made judg- 
ments; the thinker wants to find out for himself. To 
exercise the power of judgment three things are essen- 
tial: (x) the requisite materials, concepts that are your 
own; (2) the power of reflection or deliberation that has 
control over voluntary attention in precise analysis and 
synthesis; (3) the power of expression; that is, the 
ability to couch the decision in adequate language. 
Kinds of judgment. — Logicians classify judgments 
in many ways. They may be positive or negative. 
“Mr. Jones is rich. Mr. Jones is not rich.” With 
reference to directness they may be intuitive or delibera- 
tive. “1+1= 2.” “ Thisisa beautiful day.” “Iam 
happy.” These are intuitive judgments because they 
are immediate like perception. Knack, tact, cleverness, 
and discrimination show in fine intuitions. ‘ Virtue 
brings its reward,” is a deliberative judgment because it 
could have been arrived at first-hand only after much 
deliberation and weighing of evidences. With refer- 
ence to the progress of the judgment it may be analytic 
or synthetic. “The tree has bark” is analytic because 
it simply fastens upon one of the ingredients of tree. 
“Poplar makes good paper pulp” is a synthetic judg- 
ment because it adds to our commonly accepted quali- 
ties of tree. With reference to belief, judgments may
-P-A-G-E-313
  THOUGHT 295 
be categorical or hypothetical. A categorical statement 
is a plain assertion. ‘This boy is dull” (simply cate- 
gorical). ‘I have asoul”’ (existential). ‘‘ He is either 
guilty or not guilty” (disjunctive). In the hypotheti- 
cal judgment we stipulate the condition: “If I win I 
shall be happy.” 
REASONING 
The chief function of reasoning is to aid in the solving 
of new problems, whether concrete or abstract, and to 
carry knowledge beyond the bounds of perception, mem- 
ory, and imagination, particularly in dealing with gen- 
eralization from a mass of facts. The goal is always 
truth. 
Reasoning in the restricted sense is a collection of judg- 
ments leading to a new judgment. It is a process of elab- 
orating knowledge in hand in such a way as to draw 
new knowledge out of it. It is a solving of problems by 
foreseeing the end and weighing the means. It is pur- 
posive thinking of which the conclusions are capable of 
proof. 
“ Thinking in the best sense is that process which 
considers the basis and consequences of belief... . 
Reflective thought is active, persistent and careful con- 
sideration of any belief or supposed form of knowledge 
in the light of the grounds which support it and further 
conclusions to which it ieee Thinking is that op- 
eration in which-present~facts suggest other facts in _ 
such a way as to induce belief in the latter upon the 
ground of warrant of the former.” (Dewey) 
\ eis Zi : 
\ The word “ thinking ” is used in a broad sense to cover 
the three processes, conception, judgment, and reason- 
 
-P-A-G-E-314
  296 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
ing, and in a narrow sense as synonymous with reasoning 
only. As we shall see, there are many low forms of so- 
called thinking or reasoning. Psychologically, reason- 
ing does not involve any new type of mental processes 
beyond those involved in conception and judgment. 
Indeed, reasoning is merely a judgment about judgments. 
The deepest interest in the reasoning process comes from 
the point of view of logic, which is the art of reasoning 
or right thinking; while the psychology of reasoning is 
concerned only with the nature of the mental processes 
involved. A brief reference to the logical aspects may 
be in order to show in what sort of setting the mental 
processes operate in reasoning. 
Inductive reasoning. — Suppose that you are called 
upon to make a pronouncement upon the moot ques- 
tion, “Is the world getting better?” You will then in 
more or less attenuated form pass through stages like 
these : 
(x) The assembling of judgments. — You will think of 
the large number of cases in each of which you can say 
that the world is getting better; as in the status of 
women, the treatment of prisoners, the prevention and 
cure of disease, etc. With them will come a large number 
of cases in which you get corresponding negative judg- 
ments. You select and seize upon specific elements of the 
concept “ world,” and the concept “ better,” and the 
concept “not better.”’ This array of judgments repre- 
sents your resources in sagacity, versatility, personal 
meanings. 
(2) Striking a balance. — You then cast up the evi- 
dence for and against, taking into account not only the
-P-A-G-E-315
  THOUGHT 207 
number on each side, but also the weight and kind of value 
in each. For this reason the final decision, yes or no, 
expresses only a formal though true reply by indicating 
the direction in the balance of evidence. The con- 
sciousness of meanings gained in this process of weighing 
evidence is vastly richer than anything that can be ex- 
pressed in a verbal decision. This difference between 
the real and the formal result of reasoning is expressive 
of the difference in value of first-hand reasoned truths, 
and mere formal labels of truth. 
(3) Conclusion. — The conclusion which is thus cu- 
mulative may be accepted at any stage ‘in the process 
of weighing, depending upon the persistence of the in- 
quirer, the degree of certainty needed, and the depth 
of insight desired. The conclusion is always tentative 
and incomplete, but it furnishes the most vital type of 
the serviceable realization of meanings in truth. This 
type of reasoning is called inductive, because it con- 
sists in the assembling of evidence. 
Deductive reasoning..— In deductive reasoning we 
establish the truth of a particular conclusion on the ground 
of a universally accepted general conclusion. The classic 
example takes this form: All men are mortal; Soc- 
rates was aman; therefore, Socrates was mortal. Here 
the first proposition is said to be universal because in all 
history of observation no exception has been found. If 
that is true, and the second proposition is true, then the 
third proposition follows from the other two and must 
be true. 
The principle of deduction is of the most practical and 
far-reaching importance. In daily routine we accept
-P-A-G-E-316
  298 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
universals on authority, custom, or reason, and con- 
tinually use them. Accept the principle of gravitation 
and you know immediately that millions of kinds of 
things will fall of their own weight. Accept the princi- 
ple of truth telling or justice or honesty, and your daily 
acts will regulate themselves almost automatically in 
accordance with this principle. But to the thinking per- 
son, induction and deduction go hand in hand. The 
nature of justice, ¢.g., is progressively established by in- 
duction but in the meantime it is at every stage a service- 
able tool in deduction. 
Rational vs. reasoned ideas. — We understand now 
why the terms “ thinking ”’ and “ reasoning ’”’ have come 
to be used so broadly and loosely with some justice. It 
is due to-thé recognition of fragments of the blends of 
reasoning with other mental processes and of the autom- 
atized processes which lead to rational action, whether 
conscious, subconscious, or crystallized in purely neural 
dispositions. Our greatest confusion is cleared up when 
we recognizé the difference between rational and reasoned 
actions or ideas. {fhe Vast-mass-of human and animal 
behavior is rational, we might say reasonable, but only 
a very small part of it is reasoned. In the latter sense 
animals do not reason at all and man but very little. 
Imageless thought.—In answer to the question, 
“Can we think without images?” I should say, “ No.” 
On the problem of imageless thought, two facts should be 
noted even though they be mere opinion. First, many * 
of the processes which we call thinking are so nearly auto- 
matic that we are scarcely conscious of any image and 
there is correspondingly little actual thinking. Second,
-P-A-G-E-317
  THOUGHT 299 
the image is a fickle thing to observe and there is much 
quibbling about terminology. If, for example, a man 
says that he has had a very vivid dream but did not have 
any mental imagery, he must be using language in some 
unreasonable way. On the other hand, if he says that 
he cannot find in his daily life any use of imagery, we 
may question the accuracy of his observation and bear 
in mind that the recognition of the image is like many 
other great discoveries: it follows a certain order of evo- 
lution and some persons are slow in recognizing the new 
phenomenon. 
Reasoning as behavior. — The old term “ appercep- 
tion ” has given place to the term “‘ meaning,” and the 
concept “meaning” has acquired its chief vitality 
through the objective psychophysical methods of study 
of recent years. The meaning of the concept “ blizzard,” 
for instance, consists in a re-living of the individual re- 
sponses and the images aroused, such as coldness, white- 
ness, crystal, resistance to wind, and so forth. “ Bliz- 
zard”’ has meaning to a person just to the extent that 
the conceptual imagery arouses reactions appropriate 
to each of the factors involved, both sensory and 
affective. — 
Here is where behaviorism has its stronghold in the 
treatment of the higher mental processes. It recog- 
nizes the responses aroused by the conceptual situation. 
While this point of view unquestionably is correct and 
capable of extensive use, it is hopelessly inadequate for 
two reasons: (1) It fails to recognize the real fact of 
experience; namely, the mental image in its conceptual 
array; and (2) as a method of description it is so frag- 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
  300 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
mentary that, without introspective help, we should be 
hopelessly ignorant of mental life. 
General view of reasoning. — ‘To understand any 
concrete bit of reasoning, one must consider four phases 
or parts of the process: (1) Every act of reasoning is 
closely related to the felt need or purpose of the individ- 
ual at the moment. This is purely subjective in its 
origin and an expression of much in the earlier history 
of that individual and in his immediately preceding 
life. It is connected with the desires, and these go back 
to early training ; with life purpose, however originated ; 
and finally with instinct. The purpose cannot, in its 
turn, be understood apart from the larger whole of the 
life of the individual, although the momentary’ purpose 
is sufficient to enable one to understand the course of 
reasoning. (2) The outcome of reasoning is dependent 
. very largely upon the tools that present-themselves and 
upon the other-external circumstances of the moment, 
more particularly upon the way the circumstances of 
the moment are appreciated and interpreted. The 
interpretation or appreciation of the situation is very 
closely connected with the purpose. When one is inter- 
ested in a problem, one sees in it a certain situation. 
When the purpose changes, the interpretation differs. 
The purpose, then, is dependent for its accomplishment 
upon the material setting, but. the setting is dependent 
for its interpretation upon the purpose. (3) When a pur- 
pose and situation are given, some solution of the prob- 
lem usually suggests itself. The solution will depend 
upon the connections that_have been earlier developed. 
If the solution is in idea. alone, the situation will recall 
old ideas that have been used in more or less similar sit- 
uations to solve similar problems. If the solution is a 
movement, the situation will call out accustomed move- 
ments that have been learned in other connections and 
. will apply them to the new problem. In either case the   
     
-P-A-G-E-319
  THOUGHT 301 
outcome will be controlled in some degree by the purpose 
that is dominant. (4) Finally, each solution must be 
tested. The test will be the actual success of the move- 
ment if the solution is an act; it will be the belief, dis- 
belief, or doubt of the suggested solution if the answer 
is in idea alone.” (Pillsbury) 
Facts implied. — We have so far regarded the status 
of reasoning in its formal aspects of thought. Psy- 
chologically, we have traced the final-analysis to the 
behavior of images and their neural counterparts in asso- 
ciation. We must, therefore, accept the sequel and 
regard thought as intimately interwoven with all the 
complex-mental processes ; as potential action, as the con- 
tent of feelings, as capable of abbreviation and fragmen- 
tation ad infinitum, as having a rigid neural basis, as 
evidenced in organic reactions, and as having an all- 
pervading counterpart in the subconscious. i

  CHAPTER de 
EMOTION 
Up to the present stage we have dealt primarily with 
the cognitive or knowing processes, such as sensation, 
perception, images, association, and elaboration, and their 
neural counterparts. But in all of these processes we 
have observed and spoken freely of the presence of two 
other aspects; namely, feeling and action. To use 
the traditional terminology, there can be no knowing 
without some feeling and action; there can be no feeling 
without knowing and action; and there can be no con- 
scious action without some element of knowing and feel- 
ing. In all mental life the psychophysical organism 
as a whole is directly or indirectly involved. 
It has been said that all action is fundamentally either 
pushing or pulling — pushing representing all the forms 
of defense, avoidance, riddance, and escape; pulling 
representing all the forms of attraction, approach, 
embrace, and holding. Corresponding to this bipartite 
division of action we have found two aspects of feeling; 
i.e. agreeableness and disagreeableness; one corre- 
sponding to the movements of attraction, the other to the 
movements of defense. This feeling has been described 
as a leaning of the psychophysic organism, either in an 
attitude of attraction or an attitude of repulsion. 
This twofold conception of response and leaning of 
the organism is of fundamental biological significance 
302
-P-A-G-E-321
  component elemental factors, and therefore aids in the 
interpretation of human nature as composed of an 
almost infinite variety of natural reactions, for or 
against objects, situations, ideas, and other stimuli in 
behavior. 
The term affection may be used to designate the most 
elementary form of agreeableness or disagreeableness 
as associating with cognition and action. It is often 
spoken of as affective tone. When the affective pro- 
cess becomes an object of consciousness, as when we 
say “T like this ” or “I dislike this,” it is usually called 
a feeling ; when it is very strong so that it breaks out into 
marked forms of expression, it is usually spoken of as 
an emotion; when it is of a contemplative nature we 
call it sentiment ; when it becomes habitual we call it 
a mood, and when it is uncontrollable we call it a pas- 
sion. The whole “ leaning’? aspect of mental life is 
properly designated as affective life or the affective pro- 
cesses; but the term feeling is still in good usage as a 
general term. 
In the present chapter we shall review some of the 
fundamental aspects of emotion, discussing in turn the 
qualities of feeling, the function or the réle of the central 
and the peripheral nervous system, the endocrine glands, 
the autonomic nervous system, and the nature of ex- 
pression in emotion. 
: THE QUALITIES OF FEELING 
The two affective qualities. — As we have assumed 
throughout, there are two kinds of affective qualities: 
the agreeable and the disagreeable; the pleasant and ihe 
x
-P-A-G-E-322
  304 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
unpleasant; those that represent the attitude of at- 
traction and approach, and those that represent the atti- 
tude of repulsion or escape; and there are only two.! 
You may well exclaim, “ Is the quality of agreeableness 
the same in the taste of ice cream, the contemplation of 
the starry heavens, or the joy of victory?” Yes. “Is 
the quality of disagreeableness of the taste of quinine, 
the fear in a storm at sea, or the agony of defeat, the 
same?” Yes. The differences within each of these two 
series lie not in the difference in affective quality proper, 
but in (1) the knowing factors, (2) the action factors, 
(3) the intensity and duration of the feeling quality, 
(4) the stability or oscillation of affective tone, and 
(5) the infinite modes of combination of factors within 
each of these variables. For affection, feeling, or emo- 
tion, as such, has no content. They always represent 
an attitude of the organism in knowing and acting. 
Ice cream, the starry heavens, and victory are radi- 
cally different as things known and radically different 
in the action involved. They also differ in complexity. 
The one thing which is common to them all (if agreeable) 
is that they appear in an attitude of attraction. The 
awareness of this leaning in attitude is the affective tone 
of consciousness. The application of this principle of 
interpretation to the disagreeable is analogous. 
The stream of mental processes always flows in one 
direction — from impression into action. In this flow 
it surges from side to side between the agreeable and the 
disagreeable. Thus we may regard all mental processes 
1 Many authors differ from this position. Wundt, e.g., appeals to experi- 
mental evidence for six; to our two, he adds strain and relaxation, excita- 
tion and quiescence.
-P-A-G-E-323
  EMOTION 305 
as being actually or potentially in the threefold aspect 
of knowing, action, and feeling. 
If we may indulge in an artificial way of representa- 
tion, we may show the relative prominence of each of 
the three aspects or ingredients in a given mental pro- 
E fe

+ agreeable; — disagreeable 
cess at a particular moment in a geometrical scheme in 
which we use the quantitative method to illustrate qual- 
itative relations. In Fig. 21, any ratio of knowing 
to acting may be designated by a point in the plane 
I, 2, 3, or any other plane parallel to it. If the two as- 
pects are equally prominent, this may be represented by 
a dot at the center of the plane. Any other ratio may
-P-A-G-E-324
  
306 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
be designated in the same manner, indicating the rela- 
tive prominence of knowing and action in relation to 
each other. We assume that all mental processes may 
be represented in this plane in so far as these two aspects 
are concerned. Now, if we represent affection or feeling 
in relief from this plane, — the agreeable (+) toward 
the plane ABCD and the disagreeable (—) toward the 
plane EFG, in proportion to the intensity of feeling, 
—then any proportion of a knowing-feeling-acting 
blend may be represented by a single point within this 
three-dimensional figure. For example, action 20 per 
cent to knowledge 80 per cent, agreeable to the extent 
of 50 per cent on an arbitrary scale, would be indicated 
by a point halfway out toward us, from the middle 
plane, 80 per cent of the distance from the left-hand 
side, and 20 per cent of the distance from the bottom. 
We are here applying to the analysis of feeling the 
same principles which we applied to the analysis of 
perception; as in taste, smell, or pressure, where we 
found it possible to account for countless variations of 
perception through these senses in terms of a small num- 
ber of qualities. It takes our conception of feeling away 
from the vague and uncoérdinated and gives us a defi- 
nite mode of organizing observed facts in’ theory and 
experiment. 
This figure is intended to visualize five ideas, for 
which we contend and which are matters of current con- 
troversy: (1) the twofold quality of feeling; (2) the 
actual or potential threefold aspect of all mental pro- 
cesses; (3) that feeling is not a content in itself, but 
is always an aspect of the knowing-action process;
-P-A-G-E-325
  EMOTION 307 
(4) that feeling is not elemental; and (5) that affective 
qualities probably oscillate rather than mix. 
These affirmations take sides on historical bones of 
contention. At the present stage of scientific knowl- 
edge on the subject, they are presented tentatively, 
mainly as a starting-point for thought and discussions. 
Present space does not permit us to enter upon the con- 
troversy involved in these theses but a word of expla- 
nation of each may be in place. ; 
The pleasure-pain theory. — The twofold conception 
of affective quality, as presented in the pleasure-pain 
theory, has a long and interesting history. Those who 
are familiar with this history will find that the present 
theory is perhaps free from the principal objections 
which were justly hurled against that theory in the past. 
The sponsors for the old pleasure-pain theory were 
aiming in the right direction, but they did not have the 
advantage of the penetrating insight gained through 
experimental analysis in the laboratory, particularly 
the objective methdds in behaviorism. Nothing has 
given better support to our theory than the ultra-modern 
attempt to construct a psychology in terms of stimu- 
lus and response. 
The twofold division is based on the fact that biologi- 
cally all stimuli may be divided into two classes: benef- 
icent and noxious. The former effect responses of at- 
traction, approach, encompassment, and support; the 
latter, responses of repulsion, escape, shedding, suppres- 
sion, fight or flight. But the aggressive and the de- 
fensive movements may be actual or imaged movements. 
Both occur also for the centrally aroused processes of
-P-A-G-E-326
  308 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
memory, imagination, and thought, just as for sensory 
impressions. 
The threefold aspect. — Much misunderstanding has 
come from the tendency to regard feeling as a mental 
process in itself. There can be no feeling except a feel- 
ing about something, real or imagined, in response to 
something. Fear is always about something to be feared ; 
laughter about something laughable. The object of 
the emotion is always present in emotion as the thing 
known, and, hence, cognitive. There can be no emotion 
without response. There is action in the coolest know- 
ing process; and, to the extent that the situation is 
emotional, the knowing runs into overt action. Add 
to this the fact that all knowing-action results in aware- 
ness of attitude for or against the object, situation, or 
idea — in agreeableness or disagreeableness — and you 
will find in every complex mental process the threefold 
aspect of knowing, acting, and feeling. The content 
is represented in the knowing aspect, the action in the 
response and the resulting attitude toward the content, 
and the feeling in our awareness of attitude. 
Elemental. — It has often been held that affection is 
an elemental experience for emotion, as sensation is ele- 
mental for cognition. The issue is not easily settled; 
but, if it is true that there is always a cognitive element 
present in all affective states, then the affective quality 
is not a new kind of experience but merely the tone of 
something, however diffuse and indifferent the cogni- 
tive aspect may be. 
Fluctuation vs. mixture. — Do the agreeable and dis- 
agreeable mix in complex feeling and emotion, or is
-P-A-G-E-327
  EMOTION 3°09 
there an oscillation from one affective tone to the other? 
While the question cannot be answered positively, evi- 
dence from the physiological point of view would tend 
to favor the fluctuation theory.! Our experimental 
knowledge of the nature of perception favors this view. 
For example, in the illusion of reversible perspective 
the physiological conditions for change may and do take 
place several times a second and conflict, but there is a 
lag in recognition so that the shift seldom takes place 
faster than once in four or five seconds. The affective 
tone is determined by the beneficent or noxious charac- 
ter of the object as recognized in the perception or image, 
which may flit through the focus of consciousness “ as 
fast as thought ”; but, on account of the lag of recog- 
nition, the affective tone changes very much more slowly 
than the shift in imagery. 
ROLE OF THE CENTRAL NERvous SysTEM, THE SENSE 
ORGANS, AND THE MUSCLES 
Tn all our normal life, all the senses are continuously 
in play; the associative processes are in constant activ- 
ity, and all the muscles are continuously in more or 
less tense tonus or action. The psychophysical or- 
ganism is therefore continuously registering masses of 
1 Speaking of reflexes, Sherrington says, “It would seem a general rule that 
reflexes arising in species of receptors which considered as sense-organs provoke 
strongly affective sensation, caeteris paribus, prevail over reflexes of other 
species when in competition with them for the use of the ‘final common path.’ 
Unlike reflexes have successive but not simultaneous use of the common 
path. Expressed teleologically, the common path, although economically 
subservient for many and various purposes, is adapted to serve but one purpose 
at atime. Hence it is a codrdinating mechanism and prevents confusion by 
restricting the use of the organ, its minister, to but one action at a time. . . . 
The resultant singleness of action from moment to moment is a keystone in the 
construction of the individual whose unity it is the specific office of the nervous 
system to perfect.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-328
  310 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
impressions from the environment without and the or- 
ganism within, the web of associative life is continuously 
reeling off its complex pattern, and the physical organ- 
ism as a whole is constantly in a process of changing 
movements and tensions. Only an infinitesimally small 
number of these processes become focal in consciousness ; 
the vast mass blend or fuse into a sort of ensemble im- 
pression which constitutes in large part the content of 
feeling. 
Exercise. — Imagine yourself stepping out from the flowers and 
shrubs in your front yard on a beautiful spring morning and shaking 
hands with a passing friend as you say, “Good morning.” Write 
@ compact 100 word statement of what would be likely to take place 
in you during fifteen seconds of this act of greeting in accordance with 
the paragraph you have just read. Do this before reading further ! 
Even if we assume that you were dominantly in an 
attitude of agreeableness and that we regard only the 
pleasurable aspect, the situation was still one of enor- 
mous complexity and richness. During these few seconds 
every sense organ in your organism was in play; your 
past, present, and future appeared in flashes of associ- 
ation; and every muscle was in tension or action. Your 
eyes not only saw your friend in general, but a number 
of features in particular and noted the expression of his 
countenance; and the whole environment within the 
visual field played upon the eyes in light and color giving 
information not only about objects around, but a gen- 
eral consciousness of beauty of nature, a sense of orien- 
tation, and a feeling of comfort from the light, verdure, 
and chromatic display in the surroundings. There was 
the sound of your friend, the twittering of birds, the whiz
-P-A-G-E-329
  EMOTION 31t 
of an automobile, the subdued conversation of pedes- 
trians in the distance. The perfume of the dew-laden 
shrubs, flowers, grass, and soil came heavily with every 
whiff of air. Perhaps the taste of the breakfast coffee 
with cream and sugar still lingered in the mouth. The 
sensations of position, movement, activity of internal 
organs, and balancing rushed in through hundreds and 
hundreds of sources. Particularly conspicuous were the 
sensations of speech movements and handshaking. The 
touch on the soles of the feet, contact with clothing, 
and the whisk of the wind reported profuse impressions. 
The comfortable temperature, different from the sur- 
rounding air, on the face, under the clothes, and in the 
mouth and nostrils, furnished an important basis for 
feelings of comfort. Even various pains, such as smart- 
ing from the wind or adjustment to the light, might have 
added to the pleasurable impressions. With these sen- 
sory impressions came a flood of images or impressions 
more or less remotely associated with them; images of 
actual or imagined situations concerned with each of 
the present situations. All these impressions from 
without and within tended to run into action either of 
specific muscle fibers or organs, or in more or less grouped 
or massed muscular tensions. 
This attempt to enumerate the impressions and ac- 
tions of the moment strikes you as very incomplete. The 
situation was vastly richer and more complex than 
that conveyed by your description. Still, probably dur- 
ing these few seconds only a few things were adequately 
focal in your consciousness, such as the recognition of 
the friend, some particular features of his dress or
-P-A-G-E-330
  312 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
action, movements and sounds of the greeting, the pres- 
ence of a tree or shrub. All the rest of the countless 
masses of other factors remained in the more or less re- 
mote background of consciousness. But in so far as 
these mass impressions were indications of a favorable 
situation for the organism, they resulted in a feeling of 
well-being and comfort, which, although not necessarily 
an object of consciousness in itself, manifested itself in 
your attitude and general expression asin smile, affa- 
bility, and general expression of well-being. 
Such a play upon our sensorium and such massive, 
undifferentiated reactions are typical of our waking life 
—and, in large part, of sleep. It would be utterly 
impossible for us to have clear consciousness of each 
of these processes individually. The more or less in- 
ceptive actions of muscles codperate or counteract in all 
degrees of complexity with the result that the total effect 
of the thousands of muscular adjustments may in a 
moment result in a state of feeling of safety, comfort, 
well-being, and good will. Here, then, is one aspect of 
the background of affective life. A similar picture may 
be drawn from the point of view of the disagreeable 
and defensive aspect. For all this the cerebro-spinal 
nervous system furnishes an adequate basis. A fective 
tone, feeling, and emotion are due in large part to undiffer- 
entiated mass impressions for which we find an adequate 
basis in the mass reactions of the cerebro-spinal nervous 
system. 
Tuer DuctLess GLANDS 
There are glands in human and animal bodies known 
as ductless because they discharge directly into the
-P-A-G-E-331
  EMOTION 313 
blood. They are often spoken of as glands of internal 
secretion, or endocrine glands. The essential elements 
in the secretion or incretion which they throw into the 
blood are known as hormones, meaning to set in motion. 
In a most general way, their function seems to be to 
act as control organs for all other organs that carry on 
vital processes in the body. They either accelerate 
or retard vital activity and therefore serve the purpose 
of speeding up or retarding vital processes. Among 
these are the thyroid, the parathyroid, the adrenal 
glands, the pituitary body, the gonads, the thymus, 
the pineal gland, and the pancreas. 
The ductless glands are either organically a part of, 
or genetically related to, the most primitive form of 
nervous system, the autonomic system; and they act 
chiefly through the involuntary or smooth muscles as 
distinguished from the striped or skeletal muscles which 
are actuated by the central nervous system. They are 
highly organized into one interlocking system which 
serves the purpose of control in the way of power to 
speed up, slow down, or hold the life functions in normal 
equilibrium. Most of them are small; some of them 
have been unknown until recently. Others, such as 
the pineal gland and pituitary body, have been regarded 
as rudiments which have no present function, but are 
now proved to have such vital function that injury to 
one of them may mean immediate death. Experiment 
has shown that each of these glands is essential to the 
maintenance of life and the control of equilibrium of body 
and mind. They therefore play a very important part 
as a groundwork of affection, feeling, and emotion.

  314 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
Glandular treatment in cretinism.— Since Barnum 
introduced the Tom Thumb family, circuses have found a 
profitable attraction in the exhibition of midgets. These 
midgets are often the result of a disease called cretinism 
which is rather rare in this country. In a certain valley 
in Switzerland, a large part of .the population is suffer- 
ing from this disease. The mark of cretinism is essen- 
tially a stunted growth. A child, apparently normal, 
may stop growing in nearly every part of the body and 
mind at an early age, so that by the time he is of age, 
he may be less than two feet tall and so stunted in mind 
and body as to be regarded as more or less of a helpless 
idiot, — crimped, uncouth, and apparently hopeless. 
Until thirty years ago this disease was regarded as 
incurable, but now comes the wonder of modern science. 
If begun early enough under favorable circumstances, 
the daily feeding of a little pellet of extract from the 
thyroid gland of a sheep starts and sustains the growth 
of mind and body so that the individual may rise to 
full stature, develop full mentality, and be capable of 
approximately normal education. The cause of this 
disease lies in the inadequacy of the little gland in the 
neck known as the thyroid gland. The cure and the 
maintenance of normal growth to adult life consists of 
supplying to the system, through feeding, that chemical 
ingredient which normally should have been furnished 
by this gland. * 
A cretin, or one suffering from related diseases, may, 
under this treatment, make the growth of fifteen years 
in half that period and may pass in society as indis- 
tinguishable from a normal individual, may work and
-P-A-G-E-333
  EMOTION 315 
play, enter into society and business, marry, and be 
happy. But the supply of this thyroid extract through- 
out life is as necessary as the supply of nourishment ; 
for the lack of it will immediately result in deterioration 
of body and mind. 
The discovery of this function of the thyroid and of 
glands closely associated with it has greatly modified 
our interpretation of the bodily mechanisms which con- 
trol the growth and development of the brain, and fur- 
nish the explanation of the energizing, differentiation, 
and control of the nervous system in normal activity 
and, therefore, of the mind. We must for this reason 
gain a working conception of such glands for an under- 
standing of the functions of the organ of the mind. 
The thyroid gland. — The thyroid gland consists of 
two masses of cells above the windpipe, close to the 
larynx. In childhood they may often be noticed be- 
cause they swell; the disease called goiter consists of 
a pathological swelling of the thyroids. /The secretion 
from these glands is known ‘as thyroxin in which-the 
principal ingredient is iodine.) This secretion seems in 
a marvelous way to control the speed of living. It has 
been maintained on the basis of experiment that the 
more of this secretion one has, the faster one lives; the 
less one has, the more slowly one lives. When thyroxin 
is discharged into the blood, more oxygen and food ma- 
terial are burned up; more energy is liberated ; metab- 
olism takes place faster; the individual thinks, feels, 
and acts more quickly. Thus it has been compared to the 
accelerator, the primer, and the carburetor which de- 
termine the efficiency of the gas engine, for it not only 
 
-P-A-G-E-334
  316 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
facilitates the using up of energy, but also frees energy 
for the more rapid supply of the energies dissipated. 
It not only controls the speed of the expenditure of 
energy, but also accelerates the speed of the production 
of such energy; it supplies the mechanism not only for 
the quantity of output of all energy, but also the appa- 
ratus for varying the amount of energy available. It 
determines in large part the rate at which the tissues of 
the cell shall burn themselves up. 
Feeble-mindedness and retardation. — Thus it comes 
about that not only the gross development as illustrated 
in thyroid treatment for cretinism, but a great variety 
of minor diseases may be caused by disturbance in the 
supply of the thyroid ingredient and may be cured by 
the proper administration of thyroid extract. We have 
spoken of cretinism, because that is the most extreme 
case. But the greatest significance for psychology lies 
in the fact that the principle here illustrated operates in 
all degrees from the extreme disease down to the nor- 
mal; so that in a so-called normal community, we can 
observe the effects and traits of thyroid deficiency in 
all degrees of transition, and the control of the countless 
slight disturbances lies in the means that control the 
extreme disease. This applies particularly to the large 
group of so-called feeble-minded in various degrees. 
Up to the present time we have been taught that feeble- 
mindedness is incurable. It has certainly proved re- 
sistant to educational treatment. But if cretinism, 
one of the most extreme forms of feeble-mindedness, 
can be remedied in some cases, may not the situation be 
very much more hopeful for those who are feeble-minded 
 
-P-A-G-E-335
  EMOTION 317 
or retarded in a lesser degree? It may be that many of 
the cases of retardation in our schools are due to dis- 
eases of this gland and are amenable to physical treat- 
ment. In many parts of this country, notably in the 
region of the Great Lakes, we are now feeding iodine to 
school children to avoid goiter troubles. In short, it 
now seems probable that many of the diseases of arrested 
development, degeneracy, and aberration have their 
chief manifestation in mental disturbances or defects; 
and these disturbances can be remedied in many cases 
by the stimulation of the proper organ of internal secre- 
tion, or the checking of it, as the case may be. 
From the point of view of development, we find that 
thyroid as an energizer is responsible for many pecul- 
iarities and abnormalities of growth. It is well known that 
different parts of our body develop most rapidly at 
different periods according as the supply of the thyroid 
secretion is excessive or lacking at that particular period. 
A given organ may develop abnormally large or small 
dimensions. 
To add to the weirdness of this situation, we may say 
that the essential ingredient in the thyroid secretion 
can now be produced in the chemical laboratory, and 
it has been demonstrated that this artificial product 
will have the same effects as the actual secretion of the 
gland in its normal function or the administration of 
the gland product secured from living tissue. Experi- 
ment has also shown that we may facilitate the secre- 
tion from this gland by a gentle stroking on the surface 
of the neck. Where there is thyroid heredity, the feed- 
ing of thyroid to the pregnant mother has the same
-P-A-G-E-336
  318 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
effect as the feeding of thyroid to the growing child. 
This is true of both human beings and animals. 
Hyperthyroidism. —It is evident that both by ex- 
cessive production of this secretion from the gland itself 
under abnormal conditions and by excessive feeding of 
thyroid extract, great dangers to life areincurred. The 
condition of excess of supply of this secretion is known as 
hyperthyroidism. Such condition is, in turn, often 
brought about by great sorrow, great joy, and great ex- 
citement. Thus it has been shown that’one of the calam- 
ities of the Great War in large bodies of the population 
was this production of hyperthyroidism which in turn re- 
sulted in the excessive discharge of energy, and neurotic, 
high-strung, unstable, nervous conditions of individuals. 
The adrenal glands. — These ductless glands have 
been called the glands of combat, emergency energy, 
and preparedness. They lie on the surface of the kidneys 
and throw a substance called adrenalin into the blood. 
Excitement, especially fear and rage, will bring about 
the discharge of adrenalin and this stimulates the nerv- 
ous system. This adrenalin may be extracted from 
one animal and injected into the blood of another ani- 
mal under observation. And even more striking is the 
fact that the adrenalin can be prepared artificially in 
the chemical laboratory and, when injected into the cir- 
culation of the blood, it produces the same effects as the 
discharge from the gland of the animal itself or the ex- 
tract from another animal. It has also been shown that 
in strong emotion, such as fear, the emotion itself pro- 
duces an increase of natural adrenalin in the blood. The 
more combative and pugnacious and excited the animal
-P-A-G-E-337
  EMOTION . 319 
is, the more adrenalin it has. The significant thing here 
again is not the fact that extreme emotion may be pro- 
duced in this way, but the fact that this principle op- 
erates in all degrees from normal placidity to the most 
intensive emotional upset. 
As a result of adrenalin, the nerve cells become more 
sensitive, more sugar is poured into the blood from the 
liver, more red blood corpuscles are thrown into the cir- 
culation, the blood is redistributed, being withdrawn 
from the internal viscera and hurried to the skeletal 
muscles and the brain, the heart beats more strongly, the 
eye sees more keenly, the ear hears more distinctly, the 
breathing is more rapid, the temperature rises, the hair 
of the head and body become erect, the skin gets moist 
and greasy, the pupils dilate, the blood vessels are con- 
stricted, and the activities of the alimentary canal are 
inhibited. 
“ These mechanisms of response are purposive, serving 
as emergency functions, fitting the individual for strug- 
gle. Sudden liberation of sugar, the best source of mus- 
cular energy, is like filling up the furnace to gain in- 
creased heat in the boiler. Contraction of the blood 
vessels is favorable to muscular action. Increased coag- 
ulation of the blood is favorable to healing of a wound.” 
(Cannon) 
“ A picture of its activity in the evolutionary scheme 
of struggle and survival is something like the following: 
meeting an enemy, the animal is put in danger. It 
must fight or flee for its life. In either case, certain 
conditions must be fulfilled if the body of the animal 
endangered is to be saved. To prevent injury to itself 
and to do as much injury as possible to the foe — that 
becomes its immediate urge and necessity. Of the two
-P-A-G-E-338
    320 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
animals, if in one the heart should begin to beat more 
strongly, the blood pressure to rise, the blood to flow 
more rapidly through the attacking instruments, the 
muscles, the teeth and the claws, the brain and the eyes, 
while the other animal experienced none of these, the 
former would be the victor in the fight or flight. Ad- 
renalin may be looked upon as the invention for the mo- 
bilization at a moment’s notice, or as we say, after gen- 
erations of use, by instinct, of all these visceral and 
blood advantages for combat or flight.” (Berman) 
The mechanism of fear. — ‘‘ We may therefore visual- 
ize a mechanism of fear. An instant excess of adrenalin 
occurs in the blood of, say, a cat when it is alarmed by 
the sight of a dog. In that cat, at the image of its hered- 
itary enemy, certain brain cells discharge. A nerve 
\ tract, in use as the line for that particular message in a 
| hundred thousand generations of cats, whirrs its yell, 
| to the medulla of the adrenal gland. Through the tiny, 
solitary veins of the glands, an infinitesimal quantity of 
the reserve adrenalin responds. And with what effect! 
The blood, that primary medium of life, the precious 
fluid that is everything, must all, or nearly all, be sent 
to the firing line, the battle trenches, the brain and 
muscles, now or never. So the blood is drafted from 
the nonessential industries from the skin where it 
serves normally to regulate the heat of the body — from 
the digestive organs, the stomach and intestine, which 
must forsooth stop now, since if the organism will die, 
their last effort of digestion has been done— from the liver 
and spleen, great chemical factories in normal times, but 
now of no moment. Besides, should they be wounded, 
it is better they should be bloodless, and so run the 
least chance of bleeding to death, or getting infected, 
for the more tissue there is around, the greater the dan- 
ger of infection. So, like the skin, the liver which usu- 
ally holds in its great lakes and vessels about a quarter of 
all the blood in the body; is almost drained and blanched.
-P-A-G-E-339
  EMOTION 321 
At the same time, its great storehouses of sugar open 
their sluices and pour into the blood, increasing its 
sugar content by about a third because the combus- 
tion of sugar is the easiest way of getting energy free 
in the cells, sugar being the most quickly burned up of 
all the foods, and so the great food of the muscles and the 
heart. The poisons of fatigue, acid products of the 
contraction of muscles, are antagonized and neutralized 
by substances formed in the course of the oxidation of 
the sugar. Adrenalin, too, is directly a fatigue antagonist. 
It causes the blood to clot faster than under ordinary 
circumstances. It erects the hair of the animal, and 
dilates the pupils of the eyes. There is an increase of 
the apparent size, all of which are to intimidate the en- 
emy, like an Indian’s painting of his face blue and green. 
It also — but what else does it not do?” (Berman) 
Adrenal insufficiency. — Shock, collapse, heart-failure, 
and sudden death have sometimes been attributed to 
adrenal insufficiency. One of the effects of the disease 
  of the adrenal glands is the feeling of muscular ineffi- | 
ciency, and many forms of nervous disorders may be due 
to inadequate stimulation from the adrenal glands. 
Other ductless glands. — Having set forth the func- 
tion of the thyroids and the adrenals as examples of 
endocrine activity, we may merely mention other glands 
of which less is known. The pituitary body is a small, 
soft organ at the base of the brain. Until recently 
it has been regarded as vestigial; but we now know that 
it controls the tonus of the involuntary muscle fibers and 
blood vessels. The removal of this gland means death 
in two or three days. The pineal gland, another small, 
single body lying in the median plane at the base of the 
brain, it is now believed, controls in a vital way the brain
-P-A-G-E-340
  322 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
   
    and sex development and has t! 
gland of adolescence and puberty 
Descartes thought might be the “ sea’ 
etically it is the rudiment of a primitive e 
are minute glands located on the sex organs. They 
seem to control in some mysterious way the development 
and function of sex in early life, and also secondary sex 
characters. The thymus, a small gland on the wind- 
pipe, has a function similar to that of the gonads and 
has been called the gland of childhood because it in- 
fluences the early development of the child physically 
and mentally. The parathyroids lie embodied with the 
thyroids. As the thyroid controls the iodine balance 
in the body, so the parathyroids seem to control the 
lime supply in metabolism. The ductless part of the 
pancreas controls the sugar release in metabolism. 
“ Thus, the growth of the brain is presided over by the 
adrenal cortex, the thyroid, the thymus, and the pitui- 
tary. They determine the size of the brain, the number 
of its cells, the complexity of its convolutions and the 
speed of its chemistry, which means the speed of thought 
and memory and imagination. As its directorate, theré- 
fore, they may be entitled. The disturbance of one of 
them means the disturbance of all of them, and a conse- 
quent deleterious effect upon the brain. Now take the 
burning up of sugar in the organism, the great material 
source of energy, which is controlled by the pancreas, 
the adrenals and the liver, the thyroid and the pituitary. 
Together they form the directorate of sugar metabolism. 
But, as is evident from a glance at the membership of 
the growth directorate, and comparing it with the direc- 
torate of sugar metabolism, there are some members 
who are present on both boards. An infection, an illness,

. 
an ail n or intoxication of such mem- 
bers w: erations in both directorates. 
A disturl r metabolism might then cause 
a disturb growth. The advantages and disad- 
vanta; efore us of having, in the glands of inter- 
nal secretion, an interlocking directorate, rulers over all 
the varied and manifold activities of the organism.” 
(Berman) 
It is the central nervous system which is active, in so 
far as we have conscious emotion; but it is these glands 
of internal secretion that have the power to open the 
emergency valves, start the engine, supply emergency 
fuel, and set the whole organism into emergency re- 
sponse. 
The endocrine phenomena present a new field for in- 
vestigation. Relatively little is known on the basis of 
experiment. The wildest enterprises of drug manufac- 
turers, unscrupulous and ignorant practitioners, and the 
scramble of deluded patients can now be observed. Yet 
there are certain fundamental facts which are firmly 
established and have a very far-reaching  signifi- 
cance in animal biology, medicine, psychology, and 
education. ; 
We have now to recognize the effect on emotions not 
only of the endocrines, but also of germs. Various germs 
in the system operate to facilitate or inhibit the normal 
processes of each and every organic action. Thus mental 
life is at the mercy of germs not only of infectious dis- 
eases which may result even in unconsciousness, but in 
a more significant way in the fact that the body is a 
carrier of a vast variety of germs of more or less insid- 
ious, toxic capacity which tend either to facilitate or
-P-A-G-E-342
  324 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
check the life processes of which the brain activity and 
therefore mental activity is one. 
The autonomic system. — We have two nervous sys- 
tems — the cerebro-spinal system and the autonomic 
system; the latter, so called because it acts automati- 
cally, is sometimes called the sympathetic system. It 
is composed of a network of nervous tissue with clusters 
distributed over the viscera as partly shown in the Ap- 
pendix, Fig. 42. As the central nervous system controls 
the striped or skeletal muscles, so this system controls 
the smooth-or_involuntary muscles. and glands, partic- 
ularly the_endocrine system_of which it-is_an_ integral 
part. As we have seen in the above examples of the 
function of these glands, this system exercises a pro- 
found influence upon the central nervous system, par- 
ticularly in those situations which result most charac- 
teristically in affective tone, feeling, and emotion. 
Bopity Expression IN EMOTION 
That the rich and complicated activity which takes 
place in emotion is the result of inherited associations 
in the form of instinctive reactions was well stated on the 
basis of direct observation by Darwin when he said : 
“Men, during numberless generations, have endeav- 
ored to escape from their enemies or danger by head- 
long flight, or by violently struggling with them; and 
such great exertions will have caused the heart to beat 
rapidly, the breathing to be hurried, the chest to heave, 
and the nostrils to be dilated. As these exertions often 
have to be prolonged to the last extremity, the final re- 
sult will have been utter prostration, pallor, perspiration, 
trembling of all the muscles, or their complete relaxation. © 
And now, whenever the emotion of fear is strongly felt,
-P-A-G-E-343
  EMOTION 325 
though it may not lead to any exertion, the same re- 
sults tend to reappear, through the force of inheritance 
and association.” 
On the basis of recent laboratory experiments in the 
physiology of emotions, Crile now reaffirms this princi- 
ple with illuminating evidences, showing that emotion 
is the result of inhibited instinctive action. 
“When our progenitors came in contact with any ex- 
citing element in their environment, action ensued then 
and there. There was much action — little restraint or 
emotion. Civilized man is really in auto-captivity. 
He is subjected to innumerable stimulations, but custom 
and convention frequently prevent physical action. 
When these stimulations are sufficiently strong but no 
action ensues, the reaction constitutes an emotion. A 
phylogenetic fight is anger; a phylogenetic flight is 
fear; a phylogenetic copulation is sexual love; and so 
one finds in this conception an underlying principle 
which may be the key to an understanding of the emo- 
tions and of certain diseases. . . . So strong is the in- 
fluence of phylogenetic experience that though an enemy 
to-day may not be met by actual physical attack, yet 
the decks are cleared for action, as it were, and the weap- 
ons made ready, the body as a result being shaken and 
exhausted. The type of emotion is plainly declared by 
the activation—of the muscles which would be used if 
appropriate physical action were consummated. In 
anger the teeth are set, the fists are clenched, the pos- 
ture is rigid; in fear the muscles collapse, the joints 
tremble, and the running mechanism is activated for 
flight. . . . The emotions, then, are the preparations 
for phylogenetic activities. If the activities are con- 
summated, the fuel (glycogen) and the activating se- 
cretions from the thyroid, the adrenals, and the hypo- 
physis are consumed. In the activation without action, 
 
-P-A-G-E-344
  326 INTRODUCTORY TO PSYCHOLOGY 
these products must be eliminated as waste products, 
and so a heavy strain is put upon the organs of elimina- 
tion. It is obvious that the body under emotion might 
be clarified by active muscular exercise, but the subject 
of the emotions is so strongly integrated thereby that 
it is difficult for him to engage in diverting, clarifying 
exertion. The person in anger does not want to be saved 
from the ill effects of his own emotion; he wants only 
to fight; the person in fear wants only to escape; the 
person under sexual excitement wants only possession.” 
The results of experiments bearing on this issue are 
best summarized by Crile as follows: 
“Laboratory experiments show that in an animal 
driven strongly by emotion the following changes may 
be seen: (1) a mobilization of the energy-giving com- 
pound in the brain-cells, evidenced by a primary in- 
crease of the Nissl substance and a later disappearance 
of this substance and the deterioration of the cells (Figs. 
5 and 13); (2) increased output of adrenalin, of thyroid 
secretion, of glycogen, and an increase of the power of 
oxidation in the muscles; (3) accelerated circulation and 
respiration with increased body temperature; (4) al- 
tered metabolism. All these are adaptations to increase 
the motor efficiency of the mechanism. In addition, 
we find an inhibition of the functions of every organ and 
tissue that consumes energy, but does not contribute 
directly to motor efficiency. The mouth becomes dry; 
the gastric and pancreatic secretions are lessened or are 
completely inhibited; peristaltic action stops. The 
obvious purpose of all these activations and inhibitions 
is to mass every atom of energy upon the muscles that 
are conducting the defense or attack.” 
A theory of emotion in terms of facts like the above 
is admirably summarized by Lloyd Morgan: 
“T may be allowed here to recapitulate my own view
-P-A-G-E-345
EMOTION 327 
of the matter. When a specific situation affords an 
appropriate constellation of stimuli, there issue reflexly 
from the subcortical centers two sets of efferent im- 
pulses, (x) those which evoke a specific mode of instinc- 
tive behavior, including those motor responses which 
constitute much of the so-called emotional expression ; 
(2) those which evoke visceral disturbance — changes 
of heart-beat, and of the respiratory rhythm, modifica- 
tions of the digestive and glandular functions, alterations 
in the peripheral vascular flow, a diffused influence on 
the general coenesthesis and so forth. From all this 
complex of bodily changes, afferent impulses come into 
the central nervous system, and when they reach the 
cortex, qualify the experience of the presented situation 
and thus complete the instinctive experience with its 
accompanying emotional tone.” (Morgan) 
“The close relation between emotion and muscular 
action has long been recognized. Emotion ‘ moves’ 
us, — hence the word itself. If developed in intensity, 
it impels toward vigorous movement. Every vigorous 
movement of the body. . . involves also the less notice- 
able codperation of the viscera, especially of the cir- 
culatory and respiratory. The extra demand made upon 
the muscles that move the frame involves a heightened 
action of the nutrient organs which supply to the muscles 
the material for their energy. The researches here 
reported have revealed a number of unsuspected ways 
in which muscular action is made more efficient because 
of emotional disturbances of the viscera. Every one 
of the visceral changes that have been noted — the 
cessation of processes in the alimentary canal (thus 
freeing the energy supply for other parts); the shifting 
of blood from the abdominal organs, whose activities 
are deferable, to the organs immediately essential to 
muscular exertion (the lungs, the heart, the central ner- 
vous system) ; the increased vigor of contraction of the 
heart; the quick abolition of the effects of muscular
-P-A-G-E-346
  328 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
fatigue; the mobilizing of energy-giving sugar in the 
circulation — every one of these visceral changes is 
directly serviceable in making the organism more effective 
in the violent display of energy which fear or rage or pain 
may involve.’ (Cannon) 
These quotations set forth admirably the ascertained 
facts from the points of view of the experimental study 
of expression in emotion. The essential features are 
these: (1) Emotion is a crisis arising as a result of in- 
stinctive responses which do not have any adequate 
outlet; (2) these responses, in addition to the conscious 
voluntary or habitual reactions, are (a) the instinctive 
responses through the skeletal muscles under control of 
the central nervous system, which have been mobilized 
in the life of species (phylogenetic) in the form of reflexes 
representing purposive responses that have survived 
because useful and much used in the race, and (8) the 
organic reactions, which ordinarily take place through 
the autonomic system to fit the organism for emergency 
action; (3) consciousness of these responses or their 
results and the general intensifying of the consciousness 
of the result of the organic reactions enter into the aware- 
ness of the situation, which is emotion. 
The James-Lange theory. — For the last forty years dis- 
cussion of emotion has centered around the theory proposed 
more or less independently and simultaneously by James 
and Lange. James’ statement of the theory is as follows: 
“My theory is that the bodily changes follow directly 
the perception of the exciting fact, and that our feeling of 
the same changes as they occur 1s the emotion. Common 
sense says, we lose our fortune, are sorry and weep; 
we meet a bear, are frightened and run; we are insulted
-P-A-G-E-347
  
  EMOTION 329 
by a rival, are angry and strike. The hypothesis here 
to be defended says that this order of sequence is in- 
correct, that the one mental state is not immediately 
induced by the other, that the bodily manifestations 
must first be interposed between, and that the more 
rational statement is that we feel sorry because we cry, 
angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble, 
and not that we cry, strike, or tremble, because we are 
sorry, angry, or fearful, as the case may be.” 
Was James right? His general principle has not been 
disproved, but it has been found to be fragmentary and 
needs to be amplified. To restate our own view in this 
matter, let us go back to our conception of meaning in 
perception. This is couched partly in terms of images of 
associated objects and images of responses to them, and 
partly in terms of sensation of actual or inceptive 
movements, both of which are set in masses of reflexes. 
The former may be fairly adequate without the latter. 
Perception differs from emotion mainly in degree of 
feeling. The affective aspect is present in perception 
as certainly as in emotion. As the affective aspect 
increases in intensity the meaning aspect, in purely 
cognitive terms, is correspondingly enriched. The per- 
ception of a thorn on the stem of a rose is quite cool 
in comparison with the perception of a rattlesnake. 
Both present danger of a sting, but in the latter the 
awareness of conditions, the assumption of meaning, 
and the anticipation of dangers, is vastly richer than in 
the former. The clear images of leap, sting, results of 
poisoning, and possible modes of escape are conspicuously 
strong in the latter. These are set in much more massive 
non-focal flux of images, which blend into and form a set-
-P-A-G-E-348
  330 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
ting for the affective tone; and all of this may take place 
without the injection of the sensory report from the re- 
sponse. There is then a gradual transition from the 
purest non-affective perception to the most intense 
emotion. Ordinarily the sensory report from the reaction 
and the acceleration or inhibition of the neural processes 
through the autonomic system takes the form of a diffuse 
awareness of the attitude of the organism and this con- 
stitutes a dominant aspect of the emotion as a whole. It 
was this that James stressed; but, as has been shown, 
this is only a part of the experience of emotion. 
THE CLASSIFICATION OF FEELINGS 
It is possible to classify any group of phenomena in as 
many ways as we have purposes to serve. Thus, we 
may classify the population of a city on the basis of sex, 
color, occupation, club or church membership, financial 
rating, time of residence, location of residence, etc.; and 
each classification, though entirely different from every 
other, may be perfectly correct. In the same manner, 
we may construct and recognize for various purposes a 
great variety of classifications of the feelings and emotions. 
The bipartite classification, into the agreeable and the 
disagreeable, which runs through the foregoing treat- 
ment in this chapter, is fundamental; but for many 
purposes it does not give sufficient detail. Another 
fundamental type of classification is the genetic, in which 
we construct a sort of family tree indicating the origin 
and progressive differentiation of feelings and emotions 
in the process of evolution, thus indicating their history 
and relationship. Undoubtedly the most satisfactory 
 
-P-A-G-E-349
  EMOTION 332 
general classification of emotions should be analogous 
to our biological classification of plants or animals in 
which we make a progressive series of differentiations, 
starting with the group as a whole and ending with fine 
ramifications which identify the individual. Mercier 
devoted a large volume, The Nervous System and the 
Mind, published in 1888, to the development of such a 
classification. This volume has not attracted the atten- 
tion that it deserves, partly because it is written in an 
extremely technical and obscure style. I have simplified 
his terminology and have reduced his elaborate treatment 
to an outline representing a classification of feelings and 
emotions. In condensing from the original, many dis- 
tinctions and qualifications are lost anda few are omitted 
on the ground that they are manifestly incorrect. The 
sample of this classification is submitted not as an ap- 
proved or adequate grouping of feelings, but primarily 
as a suggestion indicating the probable trend of future or- 
ganization within this field, and as a very excellent basis 
for exercises in the critical discussion of classification. 
His first large division in this classification is made 
on the basis of purpose served, in which he recognizes 
three large groups: (I) the conservation of the organism, 
(II) the conservation of the species, and (III) the conser- 
vation of the social group. I present here only Group I 
of this classification, partly because that is adequate 
to illustrate this principle of classification, and partly 
because groups II and III are not regarded as satisfac- 
tory. The following classification deals, therefore, only 
with those feelings and emotions which serve the purpose 
of conserving the organism.

Taking the first of these, we divide them into A and B, 
according as they are initiated by the environment or 
by the organism. Group A we divide into 1 and 2, 
according as the correspondence to the environment is 
direct or indirect. Group 1 embraces what we may call 
the affective tone in perception. Group 2 may be
-P-A-G-E-353
  EMOTION 335 
divided on the basis of the character of the agent, ac- 
cording as the agent is (a) actively noxious, (b) pas- 
sively noxious, (c) beneficent, or (d) and (e) mixed. 
The first of these may be again subdivided on the basis 
of the power of the noxious agent, according as it is rec- 
ognized as overwhelming, superior, equal, inferior, 
or insignificant. The first of that subdivision may be 
divided according as the noxious agent elicits or does 
not elicit counteraction, or is not known with certainty. 
Where the agent elicits counteraction, it may be incip- 
ient, voluntarily expressed, or actual. If actual, it may 
be successful or unsuccessful. 
Let us illustrate further the significance of this sort 
of a classification by showing how it enables us to define 
a feeling with precision. Following this outline, we get 
this definition of the feeling of terror: 
The feeling of terror is a feeling which serves the pur- 
pose of conserving the organism, being initiated by the 
environment to which the correspondence is indirect, 
and the agent is known as actively noxious and of over- 
whelming power, but does not elicit counteraction. 
Or, take the definition of hope: 
Hope is a feeling which serves the purpose of con- 
serving the organism, being initiated by the environment 
to which the correspondence is indirect, and the agent 
is known as actively noxious and of overwhelming power, 
but is not known with certainty. 
A comparison of these two definitions leads us at once 
to a very clear distinction between the feeling of terror 
and the feeling of hope, showing that they have most 
of the elements of feeling in common, but that they differ
-P-A-G-E-354
  336 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
solely on the issue of the question of the certainty of 
the danger from the noxious agent. We can hope only 
when there is overwhelming danger; and we can hope 
only when there is uncertainty. In this manner, it 
is possible to use a classification of this kind to bring 
out sharply and concretely the distinctions that we de- 
sire to make in fixing the connotation of names for feel- 
ings. 
Exercise. — Define feelings of (a) fear, (b) hate, (c) annoyance, 
and (d) disgust in terms of this classification, and point out what 
the specific basis is for differentiating these. 
Advantages and disadvantages of this classification. — 
This is a biological classification, objective and concrete, 
and should enable us to get an adequate classification 
of all feelings with exact definition of each. But in 
attempting to apply it, we encounter certain difficulties. 
First, the names for feelings which come to us from good 
literature and common usage are a matter of hit and 
miss or chance survival of terms without reference to 
scientific relationship or precise definition. The word 
feeling itself is a notable example, as it is possible to 
recognize at least twenty-seven different varieties of 
good usage of the term. It is interesting to compare a 
definition based on a scheme of this sort with the def- 
inition of the same term that you find in a good diction- 
ary. Compare, for example, the character of the in- 
formation that you get from the above definitions of the 
feelings of hope and terror with that information which 
you get by reading the definitions of these feelings 
in the best dictionary. 
It is therefore evident, in the second place, that to make
-P-A-G-E-355
  EMOTION 337 
a psychological classification of this kind adequate and 
permanent, we would have to scrap traditional usage 
of terms and construct a consistent, verifiable classi- 
fication with the corresponding definition of specific 
feelings. This will probably be done in the near future. 
It does not seem impossible that the future may see a 
radical change in our terminology, descriptive of feel- 
ing and emotion, in good literature and daily life as a 
result of the acceptance of some objective and _verifi- 
able classification of the feelings somewhat on the 
order of the above.

  CHAPTER XXII 
ACTION 
In Chapter XIII on Neural Theory we divided the 
neuro-muscular organism into three parts: the recep- 
tors consisting of the sense organs, the central arc con- 
sisting of the brain and the spinal cord, and the effec- 
tors consisting of the motor neurons and the muscles 
and glands innervated by them. In the present chapter 
we shall deal with the effector system, particularly the 
skeletal muscles and their innervation. From the psy- 
chological point of view, this becomes a study of mo- 
tivation of action. 
There are two kinds of muscular tissue in the body: 
(1) skeletal, striped, or voluntary muscles, and (2) smooth 
or involuntary. The former are under the control of 
the central nervous system; the latter, including the 
glands of internal secretion, are in large part governed 
by the autonomic system. We shall here be concerned 
only with the so-called skeletal muscles. 
It is convenient to divide action into voluntary and 
involuntary; although we must remember that there is 
a gradual transition from one to the other and that, 
from the neural point of view, the same principles oper- 
ate in both. There is no rigid classification in which 
the parts are mutually exclusive; yet, it will be conven- 
ient for us to consider in turn some of the well-recog- 
nized types, bearing in mind that in a given act several 
, 338 
 
-P-A-G-E-357
  
ACTION 339 
types of action may be involved, and that they overlap 
and are not mutually exclusive. 
INVOLUNTARY ACTION 
Tropisms. — A tropism is a predictable response of 
animals that have no nervous system, particularly uni- 
cellular animals. Thus we have, e.g., heliotropisms, 
geotropisms, thermotropisms. In a heliotropism the 
animal turns persistently toward or from light; in geo- 
tropism it turns toward the earth, — that is, in the line 
of gravitation or in the opposite direction; in thermo- 
tropism it turns toward heat, or away from heat, as the 
case may be. Many other forms of tropism are recog- 
nized. Here we have the simplest form of animal re- 
sponse or action. The single cell is capable of stimulation 
and response to specific stimuli, but is not capable of 
modifying the response. Yet this power of response 
may be so adapted to the needs of the animal that it is 
of marked preservative and enhancing value. Such 
tropisms in animals are but an extension of the same 
principle so abundantly represented in plants. 
It is probable that single cells, or groups of cells, in 
animals that have a nervous system may respond in the 
same manner, and that much of our glandular action 
may be accounted for on some similar principle; but 
on that point we have no clear knowledge. 
Random movements. — Random movements are such 
movements as are due to general irritation through a ner- 
vous system. Most of them are in the nature of reflexes, 
usually massed so as to lead to apparently aimless move- 
ments; such as the earliest activity of the infant in
-P-A-G-E-358
  340 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
groping, twitching, grasping, fumbling, reaching, kick- 
ing, and gurgling movements — indeed, any form of un- 
organized action. They are due to the fact that great 
masses of reflexes, both simple and complex, some co- 
operating and others conflicting in all possible combina- 
tions, are inherited and assert themselves in response to 
stimuli which impinge upon the sense organs in the 
absence of organized purpose, adaptation, or meaning- 
ful awareness. They are conspicuous, constituting the 
bulk of action in early infancy ; but they are also ever- 
present throughout life. i 
Exercise. — Sit “perfectly”’ still for two minutes and observe what 
random movements you noted in yourself. Make a full list from 
“top to toe”’ in order. 
Of course you did not sit still; you were very active 
in the form of random movements. The more carefully 
you observed yourself, the more bewildered you were 
with the countless twitches that were constantly occur- 
ring in your sense organs, in the muscles, in the skin, 
and in the internal organs. 
The significance of random movements lies in the fact 
that the higher forms of action are developed by the 
progressive organization of these conflicting and ap- 
parently aimless movements into purposive and pur- 
poseful action. Thus, from the crude twitching and 
groping movements develops the power to touch, to 
grasp, to pull, and similar movements. That is to say, 
the unorganized masses of reflexes, which we call ran- 
dom movements, may be regarded as the raw material 
that develops into habits and abilities which serve the 
purposes of life both consciously and unconsciously.
-P-A-G-E-359
  ACTION 341 
The simple reflexes. — As we have seen in Chapter 
XII the simple reflex is the fundamental form of action 
through a nervous system. We traced there the char- 
acter and function of some of these reflexes. According 
to the terminology adopted in Chapter XIII, all the 
higher forms of modification in the central arc may be 
described as delayed and conditioned reflexes. 
Instinct. — We need here only refer to Chapter XV 
on instinct, in order to assign instinct its proper place 
in the list of types of motivation, bearing in mind that 
instinct is the experience aspect of complex reflexes. 
Habit. — Likewise in Chapter XVI, we have already 
traced the rdle of habit and studied its character as a 
mode of control of action showing, among other things, 
the character of the overlapping of habit, instincts, and 
reflexes. 
Imitation. — An act is imitative when it is performed 
unconsciously as the repetition of the act of another. We 
must lay emphasis on the unconscious aspect. In com- 
mon speech, we erroneously use the word imitation 
with reference to conscious action; as when the teacher 
says, “‘ Imitate this movement.” Here the’action called 
for is not imitative, but deliberate and voluntary, whereas 
all imitation, psychologically, is unconscious and invol- 
untary. Imitation plays a larger and more dignified 
réle in ordinary life than is usually recognized. This 
fact may be illustrated through an exercise. 
Exercise. — Reflect for a while on the topic “ The original features 
in my personality,” and make a list of some traits in yourself which 
you cannot trace to the imitation of others. 
You probably experienced a surprise. Instead of the 
Pa
-P-A-G-E-360
  342 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
request being unreasonable because there are so many 
traits of that kind, you probably found it difficult to find 
any examples. You thought of a number of things 
which are distinctly characteristic of you, and by which 
your friends recognize you, such as your smile, your 
hand-shake, your gait, your affectations of speech, your 
handwriting, your likes and dislikes, your habits and 
foibles, and laid yourself bare, as it were, to inspection. 
But, when you dwelt upon one of them intensively, 
there instantly appeared a sort of family tree of the orig- 
inals. Take, for example, your own most charming way 
of saying, “‘Good morning.” Let us say that your friends 
know this, admire it, and regard it as a distinctive ex- 
pression of your personality; and you have a feeling 
that it is done deliberately and heartily. Yet it is quite 
feasible for you to realize that it can be traced back, in 
whole or in fragments, to the originals which you have 
imitated. Say “Good morning” in your most char- 
acteristic way and think of it for a moment and you will 
find that, aside from certain inherited or constitutiona’ 
capacities and limitations, both the form of your expres- 
sion and the motivation can be traced as imitation of 
friends whom you have admired and idealized. You 
may not have thought of their “ good morning,” but 
you have admired them, and unconsciously you have 
taken on from them certain elements expressive of hearti- 
ness, responsiveness, reserve, intonation, smiles, gesture, 
courtesy, and countless other significant factors which 
together constitute the greeting. You may have gotten 
one from one person and another from another. Your 
greeting is a composite of traits in persons whom you
-P-A-G-E-361
  ACTION 343 
have admired; they have been taken on unconsciously 
and are daily expressed more or less unconsciously ; yet 
every feature of your greeting has a natural history. 
This is particularly true of affectations. Such a finding 
as this is characteristic of how you will discover your 
indebtedness to others by examination of any of your 
claims to originality. 
This, then, is the fundamental law of imitation: we 
are consciously and feelingfully aware of persons and 
things; we unconsciously take an agreeable attitude 
toward them, and therefore unconsciously tend to be- 
come like them. 
Consider, for a moment, the réle of imitation in our 
cultured lives. In politics there is a tendency for the 
son to vote as his father has done.? In religion, most 
children, if they join the church, join the one to which 
their parents belong, and usually with firm convictions 
that this is the best. That is equally true of Catholic, 
Protestant, and Jew; and it has biological value. They 
have come to express their religious life in the forms and 
ceremonies peculiar to the parental church on this prin- 
ciple of unconscious imitation until that peculiar form 
of religious expression tends to fit their needs. This is 
1 Many years ago the author tried this exercise and hit upon an odd double 
loop in his written y and g as peculiarly his own invention. In attempting to 
trace the history of it by examination of writing for many years back, he came 
across the original in a letter from a young lady in which this very loop was con- 
spicuous. It had become a part of his handwriting, not because he admired the 
loop, but because he admired her. Here is an accessory character of affectation 
which has expressed itself in his handwriting for forty years, and was long re- garded as an original, personal trait of the handwriting. 2 The author grew up in a community which was overwhelmingly Republican. There was in that precinct only one Democrat and he was a horse thief. Even 
in mature years, it is necessary for him to struggle against the conviction that 
there are no good Democrats.
-P-A-G-E-362
  344 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
conspicuously true in art. We have schools of art: 
here and there comes forth a great original; many delib- 
erately do as he did, but the mass of artists have a feel- 
ing that they express themselves when they take on the 
accessory peculiarities of the master whom they admire. 
This is true even in science, which is supposed to be free 
from all set and bias. In each and every science there 
are radical differences of point of view and reaction quite 
as different as in religion, and it is very interesting to 
trace each of these “‘ personal ” stands back to its origin. 
Early childhood furnishes excellent opportunity for 
the objective study of the growth of character and per- 
sonality through imitation — imitation not only of 
human beings, but of animals and inanimate things, for 
all perception is anthropomorphic. We tend to become 
like our environment. It is well known that husband 
and wife tend to become alike. We may even go farther 
and say parents imitate their children. 
Imitation is perhaps the commonest and most useful 
principle of learning, in that it works in the form of un- 
conscious accumulation of details which become fairly 
coherent with and adapted to the needs of the growing 
character. Imitation precedes habit, but the imitative 
act is perpetuated through habit formation. 
Impulse. — Impulsive action is action which results 
from feeling or emotion. It arises from internal excita- 
tion, and there is a gradual transition from approxi- 
mately simple reflexes up to action which results from 
strong and persistent feeling. The act is said to be im- 
1 The author has on record a number of cases in which peculiarities of speech 
and action observed in the laboratory could be traced to imitation of the children 
who were admired in the home.
-P-A-G-E-363
  
ACTION 345 
pulsive to the extent that the affective element over- 
shadows the cognitive in the motivation. The impulsive 
act is one which is committed under the stress of strong 
feeling. The impulse may break out, like a reflex, so 
quickly that the act can be recognized only in retro- 
spect, as in the case of sudden self-defense; or it may ° 
take the form of an uncontrollable disposition, or mood, 
which leads to a sustained attitude or passion in re- 
sponse to violent outburst. The impulses of attraction 
are no more effective than the impulses of repulsion ; 
indeed the latter, by virtue of the necessity for prompt 
action in self-defense, are perhaps most characteristic 
of impulsive action. The greatest deeds of heroism 
are done impulsively under the blinding of passion: 
if the person had stopped to deliberate, he would in many 
cases have failed. On the other hand, impulse is an all 
pervading, driving force in all highly efficient and en- 
joyable behavior. All hearty action has something of 
the impulsive character. We thus recognize the sway 
of impulse from its most attenuated affective tone in 
response to the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the 
stimulus, up to its most violent outbreak, where the 
reaction is instinctive and beyond control. 
Ideo-motor action.— In the sensori-motor act the 
occurrence of the stimulation is immediately followed 
by the response. But many acts are the direct outgrowth 
of ideas in the mind; i.e., the nerve impulse is of cen- 
tral origin. When the idea is expressed immediately and 
unconsciously in action, the act is said to be ideo-motor. 
A child, watching the piston bar of an engine, was ob- 
served to move his arm sympathetically with the piston 
 
-P-A-G-E-364
  346 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
of the engine and was surprised at the fact when his 
attention was called to it. Most of our gestures are ideo- 
motor. Recall a few typical gestures, such as the indi- 
cation of distance, of approach, of bigness, of littleness, 
of quickness, of slowness, and it can be readily seen that 
the gesture activity which often profusely accompanies 
speech, and even silent thought, will fall under this 
rubric. 
Ideo-motor action differs from imitation in: that it 
pertains to ideas rather than objects or actions. It 
has been pointed out in the study of crowds, that the 
ideo-motor action is conspicuous, particularly under 
great excitement; yet the real significance of ideo-motor 
action lies not in these oddities of behavior, but in the 
fact that this principle operates as a supporting principle 
in all the acts of skill and other forms of effective adjust- 
ment. Thus, for example, during the impressive funeral 
ceremonies for the burial of the unknown soldier at 
Arlington on Armistice Day, the idea of patriotism found 
expression consciously in such acts as the lifting of hat 
and bowing of head, but unconsciously in ideo-motor 
action in countless adjustments accessory to these and 
expressive of devotion, reverence, sorrow, sympathy, and 
praise. 
Summary. — These are the prevailing types of in- 
voluntary action the mark of which is that the action 
is not modified by conscious control. Thus, in retro- 
spect, tropisms are movements not mediated through a 
nervous system; random movements are the over-flow 
of unorganized and superfluous energy; reflexes are 
inherited responses; instinctive movements are identi-
-P-A-G-E-365
  ACTION 347 
fied with complex reflexes; habits are largely adapted 
reflexes; imitation is the unconscious repetition of the 
act of another ; impulsive action is action precipitated by 
strong feeling; ideo-motor action is the unconscious, 
immediate flow of the act from the idea. To the extent 
that movements are completely involuntary, they are 
unconscious so far as motivation is concerned: al- 
though there may be even profound consciousness of 
the movement, there is no conscious motivation. But 
such cases are rare; the normal motivation is a blend 
of the voluntary and involuntary. 
Nor is an act ordinarily of one type alone: a given 
complex movement may involve all types at once. Such 
is the act of self-defense. This act is ideo-motor in that 
the idea of danger runs unreflectively into the defense ; 
it is impulsive in that this idea is highly emotional on 
account of the danger to life; it is imitative and habit- 
ual to the extent that the individual has acquired de- 
fense habits by practice and emulation of others; all 
defense reactions are instinctive and reflex; all large 
movements carry an overflow of random movements; 
and in such organic explosions there is undoubtedly 
glandular activity of the tropism type. Yet, for the 
purpose of description and explanation, all these types 
are significant and essential because each tells its own 
story. 
VoLuNTARY AcTION 
Action is said to be voluntary to the extent that it is 
delayed and controlled consciously. This statement does 
not imply that consciousness, as distinguished from neural 
 
-P-A-G-E-366
  348 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
activity, initiates or modifies action; but rather that 
action is modified by such psychophysical processes 
as we recognize in terms of consciousness. It might 
equally well be designated in terms of neural pattern 
or process if we had the power of description and appre- 
ciation in such terms. As we have seen, there is normally 
a mingling of the voluntary and involuntary patterns 
of action in waking life. Even the purest form of vol- 
untary action involves the operation of complex pat- 
terns of involuntary action; and most forms generally 
classified as involuntary tend to be modified directly or 
indirectly by voluntary efforts. Psychologically, the 
primary condition of voluntary action is the hesitation 
or delay that gives opportunity for the operation of 
desire, deliberation, and choice, which are the main 
stages in volition. 
Desire. — Desire is feeling in the aspect of swaying 
action. It may arise at any mental level. There are, 
é.g., sensuous desires, imaginal desires, rational desires, 
ideal or sentimental desires, and impulsive desires. In 
every case there is an object in mind, not immediately 
realized, but tinged with feelings of attraction. Such 
are the appetites for food, drink, and sex; the longing 
for things remembered, such as home, or things imagined, 
such as success; the yearning for peace; the craving for 
truth, goodness, and beauty; the passion for revenge, 
each representing a feelingful attitude toward a goal. 
The companion attitude to desire is aversion. The 
psychology of the two is the same, or parallel. But 
desire occurs with reference to goals which are regarded 
as beneficent for the organism, whereas aversion occurs
-P-A-G-E-367
  ACTION 349 
with reference to those that are regarded as noxious to 
the organism. As in the case of emotion in general, 
there may be conflicts of desire and aversion arrayed in 
rapid shifts of attitude toward a complex goal. 
“Now, if we pass in review the various things which 
we seriously wish for ourselves, we shall find that the 
vividness of the desire is proportional to the extent to 
which some one or more of our rudimentary impulses 
and emotions are enlisted. Objects which do not appeal 
to any of these primary instinctive reactions do not call 
forth intense desire. At most, we sporadically ‘ wish’ 
for such things. But the wishing is of a relatively cold- 
blooded, incidental kind, utterly distinct from the hot, 
passionate, craving which we feel for objects of the first 
class. . . , The experiences in which we are conscious 
of the definite yearning of desire, or the positive distaste 
of aversion, are, therefore, those which directly or in- 
directly call into activity such impulses as play, love, 
sympathy, grief, ambition, vanity, pride, jealousy, 
envy, fear, and hate. Without these or their congeners 
to color the occasion we rarely meet with anything 
which we could justly call either desire or aversion. . . . 
Desire gains its power and vivacity from its impulsive 
nature; it gains its rationality from experience. After 
our emotions and instincts have been once expressed, we 
know in the future what to expect of them. Desire is 
the conscious condition which represents this knowledge 
of what an emotional impulse means. It is the craving 
unrest for the object which we know will give us pleasur- 
able satisfaction.” (Angell) 
In the voluntary act this desire or aversion may be 
of various degrees of compelling force from the attenuated 
affective state to the most intense emotional impulse. 
At one extreme it is relatively inconsequent ; at the other
-P-A-G-E-368
  350 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
it may run into action which is impulsive to the extent 
that it does not permit of deliberation. 
These desires and aversions may be specific and near 
of attainment, as in the appetite for food and its prompt 
satisfaction; they may be remote and generic, as in the 
desire for truth which is the commonest motive in delib- 
eration, or the aversion for suffering which is another 
conspicuous motive. A given situation may involve 
both the specific and the generic, as in the craving for 
the day’s wages as a specific object, and the general 
craving for fairness and the necessities of life. 
Deliberation. — The main characteristic of deliber- 
ation is the act of planning which, however much it 
may be abbreviated and telescoped, is a form of thinking 
preceded by the affective attitude which we have de- 
scribed as desire or aversion and followed by the mental 
action known as decision or choice which, in turn, may 
precipitate or inhibit the muscular movement. In this 
planning, there must be, first, the consciousness of an 
end or object to be attained. The conscious object is 
usually tinged with the feeling of desire or aversion 
out of which it grew in the normal process of association. 
There follows immediately consciousness of various 
means of attaining or avoiding this end; and the plan- 
ning consists essentially in the weighing of these means 
as a preparation for choice, or the movement of selec- 
tive attention in a series of judgments. 
Choice. — As in reasoning in general, the tipping of 
the balance, after weighing a series of judgments, re- 
sults in a decision or choice with the feeling “let go.” 
On the subjective side, this denotes a state of convic-
-P-A-G-E-369
  ACTION 351 
tion or satisfaction or “‘ acceptance of sufficient reason ” 
for action. 
Movement. — The final act in reasoning is the naming 
of the conclusion whether it be merely conceived in 
thought or expressed in any form of language. The 
corresponding act in the voluntary action is the bodily 
movement which takes the place of the conclusion. Thus, 
the process of voluntary action is identical with the act 
of reasoning except in the form of expression: in pure 
reasoning the expression takes the form of a final con- 
cept or accepted truth, whereas the choice in voluntary 
action is realized in bodily movement. From this 
point of view reasoning is a voluntary act, and we may 
recognize two kinds of voluntary action: that which 
terminates in a mental act (reasoning), and that which 
terminates in a bodily movement (voluntary movement). 
Volition. —In the old psychology it was assumed 
that will, which we here call volition, was the assertion 
of a sort of outside force or personal power which modi- 
fied the stream of consciousness. In opposition to this 
view, we conceive of volition as a sort of self-determi- 
nation or self-assertion of the basic character of the psy- 
chophysical organism itself. In volition the organism asa 
whole is at work in all its aspects. There is impression, 
association, recall, recognition, imagination, reasoning, 
feeling, impulse, — all more or less conspicuous in atten- 
tive consciousness. Volition is, then, not a faculty but a 
form of the organism as a whole at work. 
As a substitute for the old concept of will, we often 
find selective attention clothed in the paraphernalia of 
scientific psychology but in essence the stalking of the
-P-A-G-E-370
  352 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
old spirit-will in the garb of attention. To guard 
against this fallacy, we must recall that attention is 
not regarded as a force or process in itself. If this is 
kept clear, the psychology of volition may well be de- 
scribed in terms of the movement of the focus of atten- 
tion. Indeed, this is the modern account of voli- 
tion. 
The voluntary character of the act cannot be judged 
in terms of length of the delay. The deliberation may 
take place in a sort of lightning fashion in volition as 
in thinking. To put in evidence a homely example: in 
the good old bicycle days, I was coasting with a bundle 
of books under the arm and the wheel slipped into a 
rut which resulted in an instantaneous fall. Yet, in 
the fraction of a second there was extended deliberation : 
“Shall I risk the books or my limbs? Some of the 
books are not mine; they belong to the library. Is 
that a reason for protecting them? How much risk am 
I taking? Which of the available modes of alighting 
shall I follow? Well, here goes!” All this and more 
flashed through the mind in the time it took the wheel 
to topple. This deliberation was quick under stress. 
But the best forms of effective deliberation are quick as 
a result of acquired skill in telescoping the component 
processes. 
Nor is action voluntary merely because it is delayed. 
Delay may be and often is merely the occasion for con- 
fusion, incoherence, and inhibition with corresponding 
movement. Delay is essential, but the shortening of 
the delay without loss of efficiency in deliberation is 
a mark of mental development and power. The person 
 
-P-A-G-E-371
  
ACTION B55 
with well-developed will power makes quick decisions 
with apparent ease. 
Inhibition. — We have spoken so far of voluntary 
action on the positive side. But there is an equally 
important negative. It is often as difficult and as im- 
portant to keep from acting as itis to act. This ability 
to prevent the impulse from running into action, whether 
mental or physical, we call inhibition. The power of 
inhibition is one of the higher marks of well-developed 
character. The child’s impressions tend to run imme- 
diately into action ; but mental development is the build- 
ing up of the power of inhibition which is the central 
factor in self-control. Judicious power of inhibition is 
the mark of mental development, health, and sanity. 
Exercisr.— Rise, walk ten feet forward, turn, and return to your 
seat. Write a terse one hundred word account of this voluntary act 
in strict psychological terminology. 
Tue Basic VOLUNTARY Motor CAPACITIES 
For the purpose of experimental psychology, we may 
analyze voluntary bodily movements into a series of 
basic motor capacities, on the same principle that we 
analyzed the fundamental knowing process into a series 
of sensory and intellectual capacities. The following 
table offers a serviceable classification :

  354 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
We daily classify persons for practical purposes as 
quick and accurate, slow and inaccurate, slow and ac- 
curate, quick and inaccurate, with fine gradations among 
these differences. Such distinctions apply to all the 
skeletal muscles, and it is possible to determine a sort 
of “ personal equation ” for the individual; e.g., if he 
is quick and precise in the movement of his hand, we 
may with reasonable certainty look for the same char- 
acteristic in the movement of his wrist, arm, and shoulder ; 
knee, foot, and toe; head, eyes, and tongue. In other 
words, there is indication that he has a good central 
control affecting all these muscles. To this rule there 
are, however, some notable exceptions in the form of 
uneven development. 
Motor capacity is measured in terms of two factors: 
(1) achievement, and (2) variability. Achievement is 
usually measured in terms of the average record made 
under the most favorable circumstances, and variability 
is measured in terms of the mean variation in a series 
of successful trials. Since variability is a negative 
quality, we use its reciprocal, accuracy, to denote such 
factors as uniformity, reliability, and predictability, 
which are the reciprocal of variability. 
Motility. — Speed and accuracy in mere voluntary 
movement are best measured in the simplest, unskilled 
movement that we can perform continuously with a 
maximum voluntary effort. Some form of simple tap- 
ping may answer the purpose. 
Exercise.— Draw a circle about 2 inches in diameter. Seated 
in the most favorable position, tap with your pencil inside of this circle 
as fast as you possibly can for 5 seconds, scattering the dots within
-P-A-G-E-373
  ACTION 355 
the circle. Use the simplest and smallest movement. Make ten 
trials. Count the dots in each circle. Find the average and the mean 
variation. 
In this exercise you realized the importance of con- 
trol of conditions, such as the attitude of bodily tension 
and favorable position, minimum distance and simplest 
form of movement, holding of the pencil, effort, emu- 
lation, direction of attention, readiness, favorable dis- 
position, physical condition, and many other factors. 
In the laboratory, we measure motility with accurate in- 
struments in which we control the extent and the direc- 
tion of movement and measure the duration of each 
movement in hundredths or thousandths of a second. 
This crude test, however, illustrates the principle of 
measurement. A very slow person may not be able 
to make more than twenty taps per second, whereas a 
very quick person may make as many as fifty-five. 
In technical measurement of an individual, such records 
are given further significance by quantitative norms 
showing the relation of this capacity in tapping to capac- 
ity in the movement of each and every other signifi- 
cant muscle in the body, and of the relation of this ca- 
pacity for movement to higher forms of voluntary move- 
ment. When the same thing is done for each of the 
other measurements indicated in our classification, we 
shall have a quantitative profile in the form of a chart 
which will give, at a glance, a picture of the voluntary 
motor capacities of this individual, showing his degree 
of excellence both as to speed and accuracy in each 
type of movement as depending upon the kind of mental 
activity which is required in motivating the movement.
-P-A-G-E-374
    
356 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
Space here permits only a bare mention of the measure- 
ments in the other capacities. 
Motility measures the speed and variability of mere 
movement, repeated as fast as possible, without any de- 
mand upon the higher mental capacities. In simple re- 
action, we measure the time of a single response to a spe- 
cific stimulus. This requires perception and response. 
In complex reaction, we may introduce a series of higher 
mental processes in turn, such as discrimination, choice, 
judgment, and association. In such cases the reaction 
and the change of time is ascribed to the additional men- 
tal processes, such as discrimination-time, judgment-time, 
and association-time. Thus, in complex reaction, we 
measure really not the time of the response itself, but 
the time of the mental processes which condition the 
response. 
Simple reaction. — In simple reaction-time we measure 
the time that it takes to respond with the simplest 
movement to a clear and simple stimulus in any of the 
senses, such as color, light, sound, contact, odor, or pain. 
The reaction-time varies with the sense stimulus, the 
individual, and a number of objective and subjective 
factors which are more or less under control. The re- 
action to a sound may be made in ten hundredths of a 
second; whereas the reaction to an odor or a taste is 
very much longer. Very large individual differences 
exist. f 
Complex reaction. — In complex reaction we imitate 
the conditions of the reactions in ordinary life by select- 
ing a typical situation which can be controlled. Thus 
we may have, e¢.g.,
-P-A-G-E-375
ACTION 357 
(a) Reaction after discrimination. — To illustrate in 
color, the observer is told that he will see either a red or 
a blue color, and to react as soon as he knows whethet 
it is red or blue. In this case the added feature is the 
necessity of discrimination. 
(b) Choice. —In this case the observer is told that 
the stimulus will be red or blue and to react if it is red 
but to remain inactive if it is blue. The new element 
here added is that of choice or decision to react or not to 
react; and this takes time. 
(c) Association. —In this case the stimulus may be 
a word, e.g., “ high, ” and the instructions are to react by 
speaking the word which denotes its opposite (“low ”). 
Here the new element is the restricted association, — the 
necessity of thinking of the word for the opposite. 
(d) Memory. — Here the stimulus may be, for ex- 
ample, the name of a city, and the response is to be the 
speaking of the name of the state in which this city is 
located. 
(e) Judgment. — The stimulus consists of a situation 
which requires a judgment, and the reaction may con- 
sist of the speaking of the word “yes” or “ no.” 
Serial action. — Capacity for serial action may be 
tested at any of the reaction-time levels by so arrang- 
ing the situation that each response brings up the next 
stimulus automatically, and the observer is required 
to respond in a chain of reactions, without interruption, 
in a manner analogous to the tapping in motility. In 
this manner, any of the forms of complex reaction may 
be required in a continuous series so that we test the 
power of application at that level of mental activity.  
-P-A-G-E-376
  358 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
Timed action. — In timed action there is a regular 
stimulus, such as the tick of a clock, and the observer is 
required to mark time in exact step with the stimulus 
or he is required to execute a continuous movement at 
a fixed rate. Measurement is made in terms of average 
deviation from the true time. 
Rhythmic action. — This is like timed action except 
that rhythmic patterns are required, and these may be 
made of various degrees of complexity. 
This list of types of action time is fairly inclusive, 
so that all forms of response may be regarded as typified 
by one or more of these in various degrees of refinement. 
If we know a person’s capacity in any one of these, we 
can immediately apply it to the whole class of actions 
which it represents. For example, if a person should 
rank, say 95, in rhythmic action in this test, that would 
lead us to expect him to be highly rhythmical in exe- 
cuting all movements adapted for rhythmic grouping. 
Precision. — Movements may be divided into a small 
number of classes as regards precision as well as on the 
basis of time: 
(a) Direction. — Capacity for precision in direction 
of movement is usually tested in terms of the precision 
with which the observer can hit a sort of bull’s-eye with 
a pointer in a free-hand lunge. This test is usually made 
with the right hand, but, as in the case of motility 
and reaction, it may be made with any limb of the body. 
(b) Distance. — Measurement of this capacity is 
analogous to that of direction. The observer is required 
to make a lunge with the hand to a certain distance and 
the average error is determined.
-P-A-G-E-377
  ACTION 359 
(c) Force. —The measurement of this may be illus- 
trated with a spring letter balance. The accuracy with 
which the observer can repeat a standard pressure, guided 
by the kinzsthetic sensations, gives a serviceable measure. 
(d) Form. — The commonplace test of this is, of course, 
in writing and drawing; but exact laboratory measure- 
ments may be made for simpler movements under accu- 
rate control of conditions. 
(e) Pursuit.— This is the most complex form of 
precision; it may be illustrated by having an electric 
contact, the size of a dime, near the periphery of a re- 
volving phonograph plate and requiring the observer 
to keep a contact point on this plate through forearm 
movement while the plate is moving at the rate of one 
revolution per second. The observer there has to con- 
trol the direction, form, and time of the movement in 
coordination. 
Energy. — The two chief variables are strength and 
endurance. 
(a) Strength. — The simplest measure of this is the 
strength of a grip or a pull. One person has a vigorous 
physique with strong muscles; another is feeble. There 
are established norms of strength for different ages, for 
sex, and for other type variables. 
(0) Endurance. — Endurance is tested by what is 
known as an ergograph in which a person is required, 
for example, to make the strongest grip or pull that he 
possibly can make, and to repeat this continually for a 
given time. An accurate record of the achievement 
is called an ergogram. The measure of endurance be- 
comes also a measure of fatigue.
-P-A-G-E-378
  360 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
Particularly noteworthy in measurements of this kind 
are the magnitude and fixity of individual differences 
in a given capacity. One individual in a group of 
so-called normal individuals may have many times the 
capacity of another. For motility the range of difference 
is small because it is a simple act. In the more complex 
forms, one individual may have ten or twenty times the 
capacity of another. 
The character of an individual, so far as the natural 
capacity is concerned, is analyzed by these measurements 
so that in a chart of them one can see at a glance the 
rank of the individual in each of the types of motivation 
of action represented. 
All measurements may be represented in terms of rank. 
It may be assumed that the physical movement of re- 
sponse is the same or equivalent in all cases. The differ- 
ences which are measured are, therefore, the differences 
in capacity for mental activity. One person may be 
strong on sensation, another on memory, another on judg- 
ment, or some other factor. It is self-evident that this 
is of very far-reaching significance for the valuation of 
an individual’s fitness for action in trades, arts, and other 
occupations in which speed and accuracy of action are 
significant. 
Some of these capacities involve the possession of 
special talents, such as the reasoning power, sense of 
time, and the sense of rhythm. All together furnish 
an index of general motor control in time, precision, 
variability, and energy of action.

CHAPTER XXIII 
DREAMS 
ONE-THIRD of our life is spent in sleep—dreams. In- 
stead of regarding the dream as abnormal, queer, fan- 
tastic, occasional, unreal, chaotic, and unexplainable, 
we shall study it as a natural phenomenon, not only for 
its own acquaintance, but also for the light it throws 
upon waking life; for dreams furnish us one of the best 
illustrations of the nature and réle of subconscious men- 
tal processes. 
Predisposing causes. — We have learned that there 
is a cause for every memory, thought, feeling, — every 
flitting image in consciousness. The same is true about 
the subconscious of which the dream is a part: every 
flitting dream image, even every dream blur, flows from 
some cause and has agit relations with the rest of the 
mental life. 
Disturbing dreams occur when the nervous system is 
in an irritable and unstable condition; unrest_results in 
dreams. This predisposing cause of dreaming may be 
chronic or temporary. Some persons have such a nerv- 
ous disposition that they never rest well, and all persons 
are guilty of indiscretions which leave them to do pen- 
ance in dreamland. The second piece of mince pie, ice 
cream, hot coffee just before leaving the evening party, 
physical over-exertion, mental over-exertion — in short, 
count up the sins against your mind and the sins 
361 
 
-P-A-G-E-380
  362 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
against your body and you will have named the predis- 
posing causes of the disturbing dreams of restlessness. 
But, as we shall see, the vast body of dream life is a nor- 
mal part of restful sleep. 
Presentative dreams. — Dreams may be presenta- 
tive or representative in origin. The presentative are 
caused by sense stimuli, such as light, sound, odor, taste, 
impact, heat, cold, and pressure. The following experi- 
ments made by Alfred Maury in illustration of presenta- 
tive dreams may be quoted: 
“ First Experiment. — He caused himself to be tickled 
with a feather on the lips and inside of the nostrils. He 
dreamed that he was subjected to a horrible punishment. 
A mask of pitch was applied to his face, and then roughly 
torn off, taking with it the skin of his lips, nose and face. 
“ Second Experiment. — A pair of tweezers was held 
at a little distance from his ear, and struck with a pair of 
scissors. He dreamed that he heard the ringing of bells ; 
this was soon converted into the tocsin and this suggested 
the days of June, 1848. 
“ Third Experiment. — A bottle of eau de Cologne was 
held to his nose. He dreamed that he was in a per- 
fumer’s shop. This excited visions of the East, and he 
dreamed that he was in Cairo in the shop of Jean Marie 
Farina. Many surprising adventures occurred to him 
there, the details of which were forgotten. 
\ “ Fourth Experiment. — A burning lucifer match was 
held close to his nostrils. He dreamed that he was at 
sea (the wind was blowing in through the window), and 
that the magazine of the vessel blew up. 
“ Fifth Experiment. — He was slightly pinched on 
the nape of the neck. He dreamed that a blister was 
applied, and this recalled the memory of a physician who 
had treated him in infancy.
-P-A-G-E-381
DREAMS 36% 
“ Sixth Experiment. — A piece of red-hot iron was 
held close enough to him to communicate a slight sensa- 
tion of heat. He dreamed that robbers had got into 
the house, and were forcing the inmates, by putting, their 
feet to the fire, to reveal where their money was. 
“ Seventh Experiment. —The word Leonore was £n0- 
ken. On awaking, he recollected this word, and found 
that he had attributed it to one of the persons who had 
conversed with him in his dream. 
“ Kighth Experiment. — A drop of water was allowed 
to fall on his forehead. He dreamed that he was in Italy, 
that he was very warm, and that he was drinking the 
wine of Orvieto. 
“ Ninth Experiment.— A light, surrounded with a 
piece of red paper, was repeatedly placed before his eyes. 
He dreamed of a tempest and lightning, which suggested 
the remembrance of a storm he had encountered in the 
English Channel in going from Merlaix to Havre.” 
In each of these experiments the dream could be re- 
produced because the dreamer was awakened in the very 
act. Had he been allowed to sleep until morning, there 
would have been but little likelihood of the recalling of 
the dream. The significant fact is that, allowing for the 
realism and the dramatic form of the dreams, eaperi- 
mental procedure confirms the theory that every sense 
impression tends to produce a corresponding dream. 
The senses are open in sleep even under the most ideal | 
sleeping conditions. Sense impressions are playing upon 
our sensorium continually during the night. Certain 
sense stimuli, such as the retinal lights, taste in the 
mouth, excessive temperature, pressure and pain caused 
by contact with the bed clothes are conspicuously present 
during sleep. A very large portion of dream life comes 
 
-P-A-G-E-382

through sensory experience. Stimuli which are sup- 
presse! during waking life are given free sway in sleep 
and the possibilities for varied dream modulations are 
noto-iously great. 
ltepresentative dreams. — The representative dreams 
arise in the same manner as memories, imaginations, or 
feelings, in waking life, in accordance with the laws of 
association. They may be regarded as free associations. 
Usually they are the indirect result of sensory impres- 
sions, which serve as starting points for changes of as- 
sociation: for example, as your ear registers the trick- 
ling of raindrops, you do not dream that it rains, but a 
train of images flashes into your mind, — successive scenes 
and pictures of rain, waiting in the rain, suffering of the 
poverty stricken, philanthropy, hunger, all in realistic 
and dramatic action. The case of reverie illustrates 
the process: you recline in a comfortable position and 
relax your attention, so that mental images pass before 
you in a series, unchecked. It is possible to go back 
over the series and give account of each successive step. 
The themes or motifs are usually determined by dom- 
inant iiterests; for example, an examination, a love 
affair, some sport, business venture, fear, or ambition. 
{There are two distinct tendencies: one, to continue the 
activities of the day; the other, to live the instinctive 
_and racial traits which have not found expression during

FREQUENCY OF DREAMS 
Ts there any dreamless sleep? I venture the asser- 
tion that probably all persons dream all the time when
-P-A-G-E-383
  DREAMS 365 
they are asleep (and sometimes when they are awake). 
There is probably no dreamless sleep. But on this 
moot question authorities differ. Let us couch a part 
of our description of the dream process in an argument 
on one side of this question. Such grounds may be 
seen in four directions: the observation that inability 
to recall a dream is no proof of the non-existence of the 
dream, certain theoretical considerations, experimental 
proof, and spontaneous expression of dreams. Many 
other lines of evidence might also be brought to bear. 
The proof must necessarily be inductive, and therefore 
can be only cumulative; the most that we can prove is 
a high degree of probability of the truth of the propo- 
sition. 
The memory evidence.— The notion that dream 
consciousness is not continuous in sleep rests essentially 
upon the memory test, the feeling that, since we recall 
dreams only occasionally, we have had only occasional 
dreams. Replies to questions as to the frequency of 
dreams run somewhat like this: ‘“ Very much every 
night”; “‘ Nearly every night”; “A dozen times a 
month”; “ Hardly ever”; “ Never.” But such re- 
ports tell us nothing about the frequency of dreaming, 
for they refer only to the frequency with which dreams 
are remembered; and we know now that normally 
dreams are not remembered. Only the exceptional 
dream is remembered. If one has had a hundred dreams 
during the night, he may or may not remember one or 
more of them. Whether or not a dream may be re- 
membered depends upon its coherence, the strength of 
associational ties, the depth of sleep, the habit of re-
-P-A-G-E-384
    
366 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
calling dreams, and many other similar conditions. As 
a rule, dreams are not remembered; mental develop- 
ment and efficiency in waking life are conditioned upon 
our freedom from the burden of consciousness of the 
massive apparent chaos of dream life. 
e remember only those experiences which are coher- 
ent, clear, and rational — experiences that are more or 
less individual and have meaning with reference to wak- 
ing life) The vast mass of dreams are too fragmentary, 
too fleeting, too much thrust upon us as an undifferenti- 
ated jumble — in short, too meaningless to be remem- 
bered. Of the dreams which have meaning, we remem- 
ber only those that are recent, primary, and strong, 
and stand in striking congruity or incongruity with our 
dominant feelings. Most of the coherent dreams are 
wanting in these respects and are only distantly rele- 
vant to waking consciousness. Of the relevant and co- 
herent dreams, we recall only those for which situations 
in waking life chance to occur in such a way as to estab- 
lish bonds of association that shall extricate them from 
the mass of unrecognized dream traces. You wake up 
in the morning after a sound sleep and may not be able 
to recall any dream; but, the moment you stoop to 
lace your shoe, a vivid dream image flashes up and you 
recall that you dreamed in the night of walking bare- 
foot in the snow. Had there been no notice of the shoe, 
this dream of the want of a shoe might not have been 
remembered. On the whole, there is slight chance that 
situations in waking life shall so occur as to elicit the 
image of a dream which is sufficiently recent. 
Even with all other considerations favorable, the abil-
-P-A-G-E-385
DREAMS 367 
ity to remember a dream is conditioned upon the pres- 
ence of a habit of recalling dreams. The development 
of such a habit is on the whole undesirable; should a 
person remember all his dreams, he would lose his mind 
and be helpless; therefore, the principle of natural selec- 
tion tends to suppress dreams. -The author, like many 
other students of dreams, has found it advisable to 
abandon the intensive study of dreams because habits of 
observing and recalling dreams interfered with normal 
sleep. 
The dreams which we remember come from light or 
disturbed sleep. The failure to remember dreams is 
roughly proportional to the depth of sleep. The depth 
of sleep can be measured by psychological experiment 
in terms of the strength of the stimulus necessary to 
awaken the sleeper at fixed intervals in the night. The 
normal curve for depth of sleep shows that our profound 
sleep occurs. during the first two hours of the night; 
after that the sleep is comparatively light. Now, it is 
the rule that the lighter the sleep the more likely it is that 
the dream will be remembered. As a rule, the dreams 
that we remember occur in the light sleep of the morn- 
ing hours. The frequency of remembered dreams may, 
therefore, be fairly represented as inversely proportional 
to the depth of sleep. 
There are great individual variations both in regard \ 
to the amount of dreaming and the number of dreams 
remembered. Thus, dreams differ with age, both in 
number and kind. The child dreams most; the adult 
has a smaller number but a greater coherence of dreams; 
the very old person dreams but little. Women dream 
  
Seem

more than men. Women get less fresh air than men; 
they are usually moré frail ; they are in the house more, 
and therefore have more contact with situations which 
cause and recall dreams. ene increase with intelli- 
gence. )Savages dream comparatively little. The greater 
the strain on a man’s nervous system the more he will 
dream. Certain diseases have characteristic dreams. 
For example, consumption, hysteria, kidney troubles. 
Some bodily effect of the disease becomes the starting 
point of the dream. Dreams also vary with the season, 
the conditions of sleep, the length of sleep, the degree of 
exhaustion, atmospheric pressure, and many similar con- 
ditions. 
Sleep-walking occurs only in deep sleep. Many ap- 
parently fabulous stories of feats in sleep-walking are 
found true. A college student formed the habit of get- 
ting up in sleep, dressing, walking down to the Missis- 
sippi River three-quarters of a mile distant, undressing, 
taking a deliberate and enjoyable swim, dressing, walk- 
ing back to his room, undressing, and retiring, only to 
wake up in the morning without the slightest inkling of 
remembrance from the escapade of the night. But when 
his friends constituted themselves detectives and awak- 
ened him suddenly in the act, the whole performance 
stood out clear to him in his memory. Sleep-walking 
is dream-action. If a sleep-walker is allowed to return 
to bed without being awakened, he will have no memory 
of the dream action in the morning. 
In deep sleep we may do anything we could do in 
waking life, and even more, for the dreamer may become 
a distinct second personality, free from some of the
-P-A-G-E-387
  
DREAMS 369 
limitations of the waking personality. Thus we have 
in dream-action evidences of the most amazing com- 
plexity in the deepest undercurrents of mental life, under 
the very conditions which preclude the possibility of 
memory of the dream. In view of such considerations, 
it is clear that, from the negative point of view, argu- 
ments for dreamless sleep on the basis of the memory 
test can have ne valid foundation. 
Theoretical evidence. — Turning then to our theoret- 
ical proof, we find a strong argument in the generally 
recognized correlation of mental activity with certain 
neural activities. There are many theories of this re- 
lationship, but for the present purpose we need not as- 
sume that this correlation is complete; nor need we in- 
quire into the nature of the causal relations; the fact 
that there is an observable correspondence is enough. 
We know from physiology that no part of the nervous 
system is ever wholly at rest. It is difficult to conceive 
of any condition in which the flux of sense impressions 
should be absent. All these sense impressions in sleep 
cause dreams; the central association mechanism is 
constantly at work weaving an intricate network of 
relationships among these impressions, thereby giving 
them meaning, however far-fetched. Indeed, the very 
closing of the eye as in sleep is conducive to an increased 
play of visual impressions, for the internal stimulation 
gives rise to the so-called retinal light, “ the stuff that 
dreams are made of,’”’ which may be very brilliant and 
is always seen in a more or less gorgeous kaleidoscopic 
motion. 
Stimuli through the ear, nose, skin, muscle, and even
-P-A-G-E-388
  37° INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
the closed eye, affect the mental organism on the same 
principle as in waking life. Internal stimuli act not only 
upon the sense organs but also directly upon the brain 
and other nerve centers. Pressure caused by the rush 
of blood, metabolism, and other chemical stimuli arouse 
nerve impulses. Probably chemical, thermal, and 
electrical action within the body tissue may stimulate 
nerve elements directly. Theoretically, such centrally 
aroused nerve impulses have their mental correlates. 
On the theory of concomitance, we must therefore as- 
sume that there is a continuous stream of mental pro- 
cesses which corresponds more or less to the continuous 
activity of the nervous system. In sleep such mental 
processes are subliminal; 7.e., subconscious: they are 
dreams. 
In short, on the theory of correspondence between 
certain mental and neural processes, the continuous im- 
pressionability of the senses and the constant stimulation 
within the central system itself point to an uninter- 
rupted dream activity in sleep. 
Experimental evidence. — It is possible to enter into 
conversation with a sleeping person; and, if the sleeper 
is not awakened at the time, he is not likely to remember 
anything about it. The replies are proof that the ap- 
parently dreamless sleeper hears the conversation, un- 
derstands it, and fits his words to the ideas in mind. It 
is claimed that talking to a sleeping person is an effec- 
tive way of instilling ideas which it is desired should work 
themselves out in the waking state. The method has 
been employed in the breaking up of bad habits and in 
the effort to create desirable habits. Hypnosis may be
-P-A-G-E-389
DREAMS 371 
employed to bring out evidence of dreams from appar- 
ently dreamless sleep. If a person wakes up after an 
apparently dreamless sleep, he may be hypnotized and 
given the suggestion to recall dreams from that sleep. 
There is such a kinship between the dream state and 
the hypnotic state that it is quite possible to conjure up 
in the latter the experiences of the former. The report 
of such dreams may be checked and verified, in part at 
least, by controlling conditions for production of dreams 
experimentally in the sleep, and then checking up the 
hypnotic report by these known causes of dreams. Wak- 
ing suggestion may be employed, some think, even more 
effectively. 
By the method of psychoanalysis the dreamer is put 
through a sort of sweat-box process, not necessarily un- 
pleasant, in which the inquisitor, following clues pro- 
gressively revealed, discovers motives which step by 
step lead to the effective associations that may recall to 
memory dreams not otherwise recallable. 
The experimental evidence, then, tends to prove that 
dreams are caused by natural stimuli as sensations are 
caused in waking life; given a sense stimulus, we may 
expect a dream to follow. The fact that a dreamer may 
carry on a dream conversation, or be influenced to modify 
habits by suggestion in sleep, is proof of highly com- 
plex and rationalized activity in sleep, of which the 
dream carries no trace into waking consciousness. The 
evidence through psychoanalysis is illuminating. The 
experiments with hypnotic suggestion and waking sug- 
gestion add convincing evidence to the belief that, 
whenever we have adequate means for the testing of
-P-A-G-E-390
372 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
a given moment of sleep, we find it occupied with 
dreams. 
Spontaneous expression.— The theoretical convic- 
tion thus strengthened by experimental tests is further 
fortified by close observation of spontaneous expres- 
sions of dreams. It is a law of psychology that what is 
in the mind tends to express itself in appropriate action, 
even though only inceptive and normally only faint. 
A skilled observer watching a sleeping person may be 
able to observe uninterrupted evidence not only of a 
continuous stream of dreams, but also of rich complexes 
of dream conflicts. If this observation be done with 
the expert skill of a so-called mind reader, most marvel- 
ous reports may be drawn from dream life through the 
unconscious reactions, especially the rich play of facial 
expression, which is eloquent language. If the observer 
also “reads” the environment with the same skill, 
and associates the continuous flow of sense stimuli with 
the psychophysical expression, his observations are re- 
duced almost to experimental control. 
Waking dreams. — It may be said that these conten- 
tions prove too much in that they prove the presence 
of dream consciousness in the waking state. That is 
granted, and it is an important fact. We dream a great 
deal on the ordinary rounds of duty. One who is trained 
in psychological observation of dreams will catch himself 
frequently in moments of dream consciousness, some- 
times infinitesimally short, and in the midst of mental 
application. The author has observed dream flashes 
in his own mind, even while lecturing before a large 
audience.
-P-A-G-E-391
  DREAMS 373 
The subconscious impressions in waking hours have 
much in common with dreams. There is in all our con- 
scious life a rich encircling fringe of free association ; 
but we have acquired the valuable power of keeping this 
“fleeting show ” subliminal because that is conducive 
to sanity and mental efficiency. When you attempt to 
observe it for the first time, you find yourself in the po- 
sition of one who, at a glance, notices but a few stars 
and attempts to count them; the more he tries to count, 
the more the field of vision tends to fill up with the count- 
less. From this point of view the dream is a chaos only 
in the same sense that the mass of stars are a chaos. 
Both are organized, the stars a macrocosm, the dream 
a microcosm. : 
The more absent-minded we are, the more coherent 
and prolonged these free associations become. The 
step from absent-mindedness to light sleep is in the same 
direction and is no larger than the step from active at- 
tention to absent-mindedness. These free associations 
constitute our dreams. Free from the limitations which 
operate in waking life, free even from the bounds of 
waking imagination, free association holds full sway and 
winged fantasy is at her best. Dream fantasy has mov- 
ing pictures outdone, for the prevailing dream type is 
that of the flash-picture or snap-shot, and sleep affords 
the best condition for richness of setting and rapid 
change of scene. How little of this rich dream life we 
actually remember may be realized if we consider that a 
dream, which in the recall may be represented as lasting an 
hour, may be but the conscious elaboration of what in the 
actual dream was merely an instantaneous flash image. 
 
-P-A-G-E-392
  374 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
The theory. of dreamless sleep came into vogue at a 
time when man held a crude and all too simple view of 
the mind. Experimental psychology has deepened in- 
sight and broadened our view of mental life, ever re- 
vealing more and more aspects before unobserved. Only 
a few years ago, it was thought that to have an illusion 
or an hallucination was of necessity to show mental 
weakness. Hallucinations and illusions were therefore 
supposed to be rare objects of curiosity. Now we know 
that hallucinations and illusions are normal and ever- 
present in all well-regulated mental life. It has been 
shown that the conditions which cause illusions and hal- 
lucinations are as a rule fundamental and essential con- 
ditions of normal mental power. The very principle 
which enables us to see true perspective in one situation 
leads of necessity to illusion in many other situations. 
Now, the man who asserts that his friend has been sub- 
ject to an illusion, as if he himself were exempt, is the 
man who asserts that he dreams only éccasionally. It 
may be safely maintained that the authorities who de- 
fend the theory of dreamless sleep espoused this theory 
before the recent notable advances in our scientific knowl- 
edge in psychology of cognition were made. The more 
we study dream life in the light of scientific method in 
psychology, the more the idea of the ever-presence of 
the dream in sleep grows upon us, not as a result of more 
and more observed cases only, but rather as a logical 
inference from growing knowledge of the operation of 
mental law. 
The arguments advanced in support of the continuity 
of dream life imply and lead to certain interpretations
-P-A-G-E-393
  
  DREAMS 375 
of the nature of the dream, which give it a true setting 
in an evolutionary and naturalistic conception of the 
mind and give us a deeper insight into the actual rich- 
ness and significance of dream life. 
CHARACTERISTICS OF DreEAm LIFE 
As it will be impossible in this brief chapter to describe 
dream types, to discuss the various types of explanation, 
or to consider the various problems of dream interpre- 
tation, we shall limit ourselves to the enumeration of 
some of the prominent traits of dream consciousness. 
Subconscious. — The dream is a perfect. example of 
the subconscious mental process, in that it is disasso- 
ciated from the waking consciousness of self to the ex- 
tent that the dreamer is not aware of himself as dream- 
ing and cannot control his dreams.! 
Illusion. — All dream life is in the present; hence, 
in the form of perceptions andimages. The dream avoids 
the abstract, even verbal report, and employs mental 
pictures of dramatic realism. Instead of remembering 
or imagining a childhood scene you find yourself enact- 
ing it. It comes in not as a, memory, imagination, or 
thought, but as a first and present experience. From the 
point of view of dream consciousness, the dream is a per- 
fect illusion, in that it is a sense presentation which does 
violence to the sensory data when present, but has all the 
1“Dreaming becomes representative of the subconscious form of mental 
procedure because the mind is therein dependent upon inner resources, is freed 
from the watchfulness of self-observation, takes no heed of the channels through 
which material is borne, has no world of reality to impose upon it the binding 
regulations of what is possible, right, or commendable; has no goal to reach, but 
only a playful purpose to serve; and so may wander far afield, as does the waking 
mind in the recreation of its idle musings.” (Jastrow)
-P-A-G-E-394
  376 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
elements of a clear and convincing perception. Not only 
may the central dream object be clear; but, on account 
of the fact that the span of the subconscious is much 
greater than the span of the conscious, an extraordinary 
richness of detail of background and setting is pres- 
ent. 
Dramatic. — The dream is dramatic: it is living ac- 
tion in the present, realistic and free from the limitations 
of reality. In the dream of your childhood days you are 
right there in a concrete situation, playing your old-time 
partinareal place, with real objects and playmates around, 
regardless of the limitations of timeandspace. The dream 
makes use of all the forms of dramatic license. Anachro- 
nisms do not jar.. You are carried passively as in a state 
of fascination, or at the mercy of great powers. You 
are the chief actor, or at least an active observer. The 
dramatic effect is so complete that you do not doubt the 
reality of the situation. Hence the dream may possess 
the powers and charms of the drama to a degree which is 
never attainable in waking life. 
Symbolical. — The more intimately we penetrate into 
our dream life, the more we realize that the dream is sym- 
bolical. This again is merely the extension of the princi- 
ple of free association. Even abstract ideas, such as 
truth, purity, and beauty, are pictured in rich trains of 
extravagant images, all relevant; often the relevance 
is the more astonishing as the relation is far fetched. 
The recognition of this principle of symbolism is funda- 
mental in dream interpretation through psychoanalysis. 
Exaggeration. — It follows that dream life is a process 
of gross exaggeration. It would be truer to say that it is
-P-A-G-E-395
    
DREAMS 377 
the exaggerated dreams that we remember. Those that 
are not exaggerated are too common and too frequent 
to be observed and remembered. Yet the dream does 
exaggerate. When a reflection of the moon strikes upon 
your closed eyelids, you do not dream that, but in your 
dramatic and exaggerated fashion you dream that you are © 
in a tropical climate, living in a scene of gorgeous light 
and life. 
Violation of time, space, and causality. — The dream is 
an image or group of images appearing in accordance with 
the laws of association. In the absence of the waking 
“censor,” self-control, these images are free, independent 
of the three limitations which make experience consistent 
— the laws of time, space, and causality. These concepts 
all operate in a dream but with dream license; one of the 
charms of dream life is its freedom in the sense of abandon 
— the disregard for time, space, and energy. As regards 
time, the dramatic license of the dream makes everything 
present, whether it is taken from the past, present, the 
future, or the non-existent. As regards space, miles, 
continents, oceans, cut no figure; everything must be 
in the plot, and the plot is where you are. The gates 
of death offer no obstruction, for our departed loved ones 
comfort us with a sense of their real presence in our dreams. 
We do not hesitate to claim new powers, such as the 
ability to fly, to pass instantly from one continent to an- 
other, to transcend the bounds of death, to communicate 
with the gods. 
However, certain dreams, such as bogey dreams, present 
just the opposite state of affairs. The dreamer feels de- 
prived of all energy, helpless, and lost. But this unnatural
-P-A-G-E-396
  378 s INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
feeling of restriction also falls under the principle of dis- 
regard for time, space, and energy. 
Flash-like. — Dreams do not take the same time as 
waking mental processes do. Many are flash-like and 
ofa fragmentary order. You can dream ina second what 
it may take half an hour to recount in memory. Most 
people have had such experience with the slam of a door 
or the touch of a falling object; that the same thing which 
gave rise to the dream also awakened the sleeper, and a 
long dream was completed before the awakening. The 
dream is like a flash-light picture. There is an instanta- 
neous view of a familiar situation and this is elaborated 
in the reproduction. This trait is characteristic of the 
prolonged dream as in a many-hour struggle to solve a 
problem or to extract yourself from a difficult situation. 
What happens is that the same scene or succession of 
scenes is repeatedly flashed into view in a sort of vicious 
circle, if bad ; or beneficent circle of events, if good. But 
the mind, meanwhile, flies into countless supplementary 
dreams. Transition from type to type in dreams is easy, 
and the episodic feature of the dream finds but a poor 
imitation in the moving-picture serial. In emotional 
dreams the reaction of emotional excitement furnishes 
the basis for continuity or repetition of the same 
dream. 
Absence of surprise. — The dreamer is not surprised 
at his power to fly, at his seeing of a dead friend, at his 
being caught in a most unfortunate situation. Nor does 
he really appreciate the ludicrous. One can readily 
dream of surprise or dream of a ludicrous situation as 
such; but as a rule those situations which in waking life
-P-A-G-E-397
DREAMS 379 
would excite surprise and the feelings of the ludicrous, 
the ridiculous, the grotesque, do not excite those feelings 
in sleep. If they did, the sense of reality of the dream 
experience would be lost. 
Lower plane. — Dream life is ordinarily on a lower 
moral plane than waking life. There are several reasons 
for this. Waking life is to some extent what we will it to 
be. It is a continuous struggle for us to be as good and 
bright as we are when awake. In the dream this will 
is in abeyance and the gold and dross of human nature 
flow mixed and unrestricted in the dream stream. In the 
narrow sense, it is true that in the dream your character 
is what you really are; while your waking character 
is what you wish to seem to be. 
Reversion to type. — In the dream there is a réver- 
sion to type. The dreamer often lives in his childhood 
nature or in the earlier types of his race. The reason for 
this is that the subconscious processes appear through the 
lower and older structures of the brain. Instincts and 
habits play an important réle. Sleep means comparative 
rest of the latest acquired brain connections through 
which we show our highest acquisitions of character. 
Intellectual feats. — The solving of mathematical prob- 
lems is the stock example of dream thinking. Volapiik, 
a world language, was invented in this way. The story 
of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was conceived in a dream. 
The famous Diabola Sonata by Tartini is simply a record 
of what the dreaming composer heard the devil play. 
Most people can cite evidences of reasoning, discovery, 
invention, art production, and similar creative work 
accomplished in dreams. 
 
-P-A-G-E-398
  380 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
The first thing to observe in regard to these dreams 
is, however, that as a rule they are not so wonderful, so 
great, so funny, so valuable after due waking reflection 
upon them as they seemed in the dream or upon the 
immediate awakening. Do not stake your fortunes on 
plans conceived in sleep or half slumber. 
Emotional sway. — The suffering in dreams is a real 
suffering, and the pleasure in dreams is a real pleasure. 
A visit which I make to a dear friend in a dream is to 
me a real renewal of friendship and has a marked effect in 
waking life. The pleasures are real and the pains are 
real. The bodily expression of emotion in nightmare, for 
example, may be so severe as permanently to impair the ~ 
nervous system. Likewise, the physical expression of 
joy, as in beautiful scenery, may be as pronounced as any 
pleasurable emotion in waking life. 
Automatic. — There is no voluntary attention in the 
dream. The dream attention is passive. You may dream 
of all sorts of activity of voluntary attention and will, 
but these are merely dream illusions in which you are 
represented as willing. All dream action is automatic. 
' Even in the case of sleep walking, the most complicated 
tasks are performed automatically. 
Wish fulfillment. — “ The dream is the concealed reali- 
zation of a suppressed desire.’”’ This is the theory of the 
psychoanalytic school of psychology. It embodies the 
most profound single fact ever discovered about dreams, 
and is a most fruitful theory, however extravagant and 
repulsive it may have been in its first form. This theory 
has given us a point of view and has stimulated investi- 
gation into the nature and meaning of dream life which
-P-A-G-E-399
DREAMS 381 
has already vitalized psychology materially. However, 
the method of psychoanalysis is so complicated and so 
controversial, at the present time, that it cannot profit- 
ably be given a place in the elementary textbook, al- 
though no thorough study of dreams can now be under- 
taken without acquaintance with such works as Freud’s 
“ The Interpretation of Dreams ” and some of its Most 
important sequels. 
VERIDICAL DREAMS 
The problem of veridical dreams (dreams that come 
true, prophetic, premonitory, and telepathic dreams) has 
come down to us from ages of superstition and ignorant 
crédility. The reports on the fulfillment of dreams are 
notoriously flimsy. The most marvelous dreams are of 
the round robin type which grow more wonderful for each 
time that they are told. There is a strong tendency in 
the human mind to believe the wonderful uncritically ; 
errors of observation, retroactive memory, and narration 
are notorious. The omission of facts because the narrator 
does not consider them relevant is a common form of 
“white lie.” Community of ideas is an important 
explanatory principle. Coincidence_goes much further 
than has been generally supposed as an explanation-of 
these phenomena. In the face of the very massive litera- 
‘ture in support of veridical dreams and the very common 
belief in them at the present time, we are forced, after a 
critical study of the subject, to the opinion that when all 
the facts are taken into account the marvelous veridical 
dreams are usually explained — away.
-P-A-G-E-400
  382 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
Premonitions that come true. — Among the types of 
dreams which have been fulfilled when rightly interpreted 
are the following. There are numerous dreams which 
give a premonition of a bodily condition. Recently a 
student reported that during the previous night he had 
dreamed he was losing his eyesight ; that he was in a phy- 
sician’s office suffering in despair over blasted hopes and 
ambition, feeling that with the loss of sight all happiness 
was lost. He woke up in the morning to find that a sty 
had developed in the right eye. A man dreamed that he 
had been bitten by a mad dog and woke up in the morning 
to find that an ulcer had been formed on his leg. A 
patient dreamed that he had been seized with apoplexy 
and he actually died of that very disease three days 
later. In such cases dream consciousness was warned 
of oncoming trouble before the waking consciousness., 
Such premonitions in allegory or in plain fact may come 
in an infinite variety of ways regarding matters in the 
environment as well as in the organism and may be due 
to heightened sensibility of dream consciousness. In this 
way persons have been warned in dreams of fire at a great 
distance, of the suffering of a person in a distant room, 
and of various other sorts of occurrences just beyond the 
reach of the normal use of the senses. Then, there is 
the very interesting class of dreams which cause their own 
fulfillment., There are cases on record in which a person 
has dreamed that he should die at a certain time and has 
died at that very time, probably from the influence of 
expectation... If one can die simply because he has 
dreamed that he should die, what cannot one do in the 
way of fulfillment of dreams under the influence of ex-
-P-A-G-E-401
DREAMS 383 
pectation? Dreams suggest to us that we shall do certain 
things and, in obedience to this inner voice, we go and do 
them. But most-dreams which actually come true may 
properly be classified as coincidences. We dream an end- 
less mass of dreams:\\ We re: ber only those which are 
brought up by some a ani Now, when something 
happens, the happening recallsthe dream. That particu- 
lar dream is extricated from the mass of dreams which may 
never be recalled, and we rightly feel that this dream has 
been fulfilled. As a matter of fact, it is probably only 
a coincidence — a result of chance. Many of the most 
puzzling dreams are explained in this way. 
Waking effects. — The greatest significance of the dream 
lies in its influence on waking life. If we bear in mind 
that the vast mass of subconscious life which holds full 
sway in the dream is a continuous stream which under- 
lies our conscious waking life in unrestricted rich inter- 
play, we shall understand how all the experiences of 
dream life are carried over as organic memories into 
waking life. Whether the dream is remembered or 
believed or not, every dream enters into the reactions 
of waking life." 
  1 One day I said at the dinner table, “This is the celery season. It is very 
good this year. We must have a lot of it for the children.” The next day there 
appeared a luscious bunch of celery on the table and at the first glimpse of it I 
recalled that the night before speaking of the celery I had dreamed of seeing a 
hay rack load of the most luscious and appetizing celery hauled into town. 
This was the first instant that I had been conscious of the dream, but it is easy to 
see how the menu in this household was changed by a dream which had never 
been noticed or remembered until after the effect had taken place.

  CHAPTER XXIV 
INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGY . 
InpIviDvAL psychology consists of scientific analyses, 
tests, ratings, and measurements in the identification 
of a given individual’s psychophysic equipment, both 
as to original nature or inherited capacity, and- nurture 
or acquired abilities, for the purpose of a scientific under- 
standing, description, and motivation of the individual. 
In the present chapter, we can only give a few examples 
of points of view, methods, and interpretations in the 
use of mental tests, ratings, and measurements.’ This 
is the phase of psychology in which we are all interested 
both as regards knowledge of ourselves and knowledge of 
others. Indeed, all technical studies in psychology are 
merely a preliminary to this, for we are working under 
the slogan, ‘‘ Know thyself.” 
ANALYZED RATING 
EXeERCISE.— Prepare six blanks like that on the next page. The 
legends need not be copied. Fill out one of these blanks yourself and 
1The word “test” in psychology is quite American and has been adopted in 
many languages. There is no sharp line of demarcation between test and 
measurement, but in general the former is used with reference to comparatively 
simple procedure without laboratory apparatus and for immediate practical 
purposes; whereas the latter is used with reference to laboratory procedure 
under well-controlled conditions. From this we should not infer that tests are 
inferior to measurements; each may be adapted to its place. As a rule, tests 
are adopted for group examination, whereas measurements can be made on 
only one individual at a time. But there are important exceptions to this dis- 
tinction. A rating is merely a record of systematic observation or judgment. 
Exercise 1 is an example of a mental rating; exercise 2 of a mental test.

386 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
ask five members of your class who know you best and in whose judg- 
ment you have confidence each to rate you independently and con- 
jidentially. Proceed with scientific frankness. 
Directions. — Record your judgment on each capacity 
by placing a check mark (\/) at the appropriate point in 
the dotted line. Compare yourself with college students 
as a class at your stage of advancement in college. Rate 
conservatively, bearing in mind that in the long run for a 
class there should be as many marks below average as 
above. If in serious doubt, put a question mark above 
the check. Guard rigorously against giving information 
to or receiving from others who are rating independently ; 
but otherwise you may discuss the matter freely. At the 
bottom note (1) specific evidence of achievements which 
indicate your main forte, and (2) evidences indicative 
of your main fault. 
Purpose. — The object of this analyzed rating is to 
secure a fairly clear picture of your endowment for ad- 
vanced and original work as a student. The record should 
give a profile showing the relative prominence of each 
of the features listed. A person may be very high in one 
capacity and lowin another. No one is uniformly high or 
lowin all. These capacities are not of equal value. One 
feature may be essential for one field of pursuit; an- 
other feature for another. The records should never be 
averaged. 
This inventory should operate to discover your fitness 
for further education regardless of present plans, and 
1 Printed or mimeographed sheets may be supplied. This blank is now 
used extensively in the selecting of candidates for stipends and honors. 
To save time the ratings may be recorded in terms of per cent and all 
transferred to one chart. The dots represent 2% steps.

should serve as a starting point in self-analysis and a 
guide in consultation with your superiors. File the six 
profiles with your diary or private papers, for, 
“Oh, wad some power the Giftie gie us 
Ko see oursel’s as others see us.” 
Among the important features of this rating is the fact 
that you were forced to think systematically about 
yourself and to register your judgment with discrimi- 
nation. The analysis feature, requiring you to judge one 
thing at a time, brought out the fact that you have high 
points and low points, and that these differences are of 
vital significance to you in the full planning of your 
studies and the selection of a career. There are serious 
sources of error in such rating, but a study of the differ- 
ences in the six ratings throws much light upon the char- 
acter of particular fitnesses or faults from different 
angles of observation. Often disagreements throw val- 
uable light on the situation. The seriousness and thor- 
oughness with which you follow up a lead of this kind 
is the best mark of fitness. Individual psychology is 
only a matter of curiosity unless it is used as a basis for 
guidance in action. 
Personnel rating in the army.— The most notable ex- 
ample of the use of an analyzed rating system in personnel 
work is that which was adopted as a basis for selection 
and promotion in our army during the late war. When 
confronted with an enormous army in which appoint- 
ments, assignments, and promotions had to be made, 
such principles as seniority, personal acquaintance, and 
records of achievement were found inadequate. The 
government, therefore, turned to methods of “ business 
 
-P-A-G-E-406
  388 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
efficiency,” a concept which had just come into vogue 
from applied psychology. The Adjutant General issued 
an order directing that, with the exception of a few at 
the top, men of all ranks should be rated at stated 
intervals on five points: physical qualities, intelligence, 
leadership, personal qualities, general value to the Service. 
These ratings, assembled at headquarters, became cumu- 
lative, and were kept daily so ranked in a card catalogue 
that on a few minutes’ call the assignment or promotion of 
an individual, a score, a hundred, or a thousand men could 
be made on merit at headquarters ; because these cumula- 
tive ratings, together with the mental test record, the full 
questionnaire information collected on enlistment, and the 
cumulative army record taken together furnished an 
up-to-date inventory in terms of which the personnel cards 
were daily sorted in anticipation of call for action. The 
rating card was the medium through which each officer 
could register effectively his judgment of merit from time 
to time. Many did not know that there was any “ psy- 
chology ” in this system of promotion; indeed, this fur- 
nished a good illustration of how science at its best be- 
comes common sense. This is the goal of individual 
psychology — that its methods and aims shall become so 
natural and reasonable as to be taken for common sense 
or good business... The method had great shortcomings in 
the emergency use during the War, but in the modifications 
and adaptations being’ made since demobilization, the 
method of analyzed rating occupies an important place in 
our army organization. Thete is a gradual transition 
from ratings to tests and measurements: the better the 
rating the more it deals with observation under control.
-P-A-G-E-407

TESTS 
Subject matter test. — The school examination is the 
original form of mental test. From this have developed 
highly specialized methods of testing ability or achieve- 
ment in school subjects, such as reading, writing, arith- 
metic, spelling, geography, stenography, and composi- 
tion in terms of which we can measure progress and 
fitness of the individual and organize content of courses. 
On this plan we now have standardized scales, such as 
handwriting scales, reading scales, composition scales ; 
and, within each of these, there are scales for specific 
features. Thus, in the arithmetic scales we have separate 
norms for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and 
division. To pass the Courtis test in Addition in a given 
grade means the same thing from school to school and from 
year to year, and is capable of universal and permanent 
standardization. That scale in itself has done more 
than anything else for the founding of principles of teach- 
ing addition and school administration in arithmetic. For 
grading of individuals, it gives us a standard of measure 
quite analogous to the pound or the inch. Before its 
adoption, evaluation of arithmetic ability was on the basis 
of primitive barter. 
Tests of occupational fitness. — The principle of meas- 
uring fitness for a particular task has been extended into 
many sorts of practical situations, so that we now have 
tests for the purpose of occupational selection fast taking 
the place of the crude method of snap judgment and the 
economic waste of ‘trying out” personnel indiscrim- 
inately, e.g., in the selection of clerical help, machine 
operatives, salesmen, and even college students.
-P-A-G-E-408
  390 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
The introduction of this method of selection and 
sorting at the employment stage has forced the schools to 
consider fitness for a given occupation before accepting 
students for a course of specific occupational training. 
Vocational selection at the earning stage has thus led to- 
vocational guidance at the educational stage. Both are 
yet in a very crude state, although great ingenuity has 
been displayed in recent years in developing the tech- 
nique of individual psychology for these purposes. 
Psychology, thus applied to the individual, has led 
to job analysis —a systematic, psychological study of 
the job or occupation for the purpose of determining 
what mental and manual factors are involved. Each 
occupation requires a certain type of fitness and this 
must be taken into account for the purpose of fitting the 
individual to the job. Of two persons equally valuable 
to society, one may be highly fitted for a given occupation, 
and another utterly unfit, although possessing high quali- 
fications in other directions. Failure to take these individ- 
ual differences into account in human occupations has 
been the source of enormous waste, suffering, and sacrifice. 
One job, for example, requires good eyesight, good memory, 
and quick discrimination; another requires quick reac- 
tion time, emotional stability, and good judgment; an- 
other artistic temperament, creative imagination, and 
initiative ; another good visual imagery, memory for form, 
andakeensenseofcolor. These four fragments of job speci- 
fications call for radically different personnel equipment. 
It is the theory of job analysis that each job should be 
* filled by a person who has natural capacity for that 
kind of job; because only then will he be at his best,
-P-A-G-E-409
INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGY 3901 
happy, at ease, and able to render the best service. We 
have on the one hand, then, analysis of the job, and on 
the other, analysis of the individual. It is the duty 
of society to use its best efforts to find the right person for 
the right job, from the humblest occupation to the high- 
est, involving special capacities. That is the third link 
in the chain; it applies to both selection and guidance. 
One of the finest applications of this principle in modern 
times is in the treatment of the feeble-minded, for it has 
been found that if you determine the remnant capacities 
of these unfortunates and place them in a busy life with 
reference to capacity for achievement, cuildren who have 
been a curse to themselves and their homes may, in a well- 
regulated institution, be made happy, useful, and good. 
And what is true at these lowest levels of human achieve- 
ment has correspondingly greater possibilities when 
applied to the intelligent direction of human energies of 
the normal and especially the highly gifted. 
One of the most striking observations in personnel 
direction is that many important jobs do not require the 
exercise of certain otherwise valued mental traits, such 
as memory, imagination, and strength of intelligence. 
On the other hand, there are a great many occupations 
in life which require a rather broad group of powers. 
Such are the professions of law, medicine, engineering, and 
teaching. It would be difficult to say that one individual 
is fit for one and not for the other. On the other hand, 
there are marked requirements of fitness for what may be 
known as the professional group of intellectual activities. 
Tests of general intelligence. — The Binet-Simon tests 
are the original and best known series of tests of what is
-P-A-G-E-410
  
392 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
called general intelligence, mental age, mental alertness, 
mentality tests. They depend on the principle that it 
is possible so to grade a series of tasks as to constitute 
a norm for the maximum achievement at each successive 
age level. If the child succeeds in the performance of the 
task normal for his age, but fails in the tasks for the next 
year above, he is said to be at age, or normal. Devi- 
ation from this is marked in terms of year or half year 
above or below normal, as the case may be, and the rat- 
ing is designated as his mental age. ‘This principle, 
adapted to the rating of adults in the army, led to the 
discovery that the average mental age of the enlisting 
American soldier in the late war was 13.15 years. The 
method of arriving at this figure is subject to criticism, 
but the finding is probably not far from the truth and 
furnishes a rather striking illustration of how tests reveal 
very surprising conditions which, when closely examined, 
seem natural and reasonable. 
Since a deviation of one-year is more significant in the 
earlier than in the later years, the designation of intel- 
ligence quotient (I.Q.) has been adopted in the place of 
mentalage. The I.Q. is the ratio of mental age to chron- 
ological age: it is found by dividing the child’s men- 
tal age by his chronological age and expressing it in terms 
of per cent. An I.Q. of too would therefore be normal.

tion:

Although tests of this order are yet crude and have been 
much abused, they have proved to be an invaluable tool 
in human engineering. They are coming into official 
recognition in our institutions and schools for the segrega- 
tion of the defective, the delinquent, the criminal, and those 
otherwise unfit; they are used extensively for a general 
and superficial index in all sorts of activities from the 
kindergarten up to the specialized professions. 
The army mental tests. — When we entered the War 
in 1917, we were confronted with the gigantic problem of 
selecting, sorting, and assigning millions of men by the 
quickest procedure possible. The American Psycholog- 
ical Association was called upon to answer the question, 
“ Can psychology help in this project of human engineer- 
ing?” The result was the organization of the now famous 
system of army mental tests. The Alpha test marked an 
epoch in history. It was organized on the general scheme 
of the intelligence test plan. The specific purposes were 
to aid : — 
“‘ (1) In the discovery of men whose superior intelli- 
gence suggests their consideration for advancement; 
(2) in the prompt selection and assignment to develop- 
ment battalions of men who are so inferior mentally that 
they are suited only for selected assignments; (3) in 
forming organizations of uniform mental strength where 
such uniformity is desired; (4) in forming organiza- 
tions of superior mental strength where such superiority 
is demanded by the nature of the work to be performed ;

Directions: Answer the twenty questions on the opposite page, 
only by quoting words or phrases from the text. You are allowed 25 
minutes’ time. Review answers. Remember to answer only by 
direct quotation from the text. 
We thank you for the order recently given to Mr. Oaks, and 
shall immediately forward the goods. 
Nowadays it is the practice of nearly all merchants to submit 
at intervals of not exceeding a year, statements of their financial 
condition. Sometimes these reports are made through the mer- 
cantile agencies and sometimes direct to the wholesalers. So 
far as we can find you do not appear to have given this information 
to any one and therefore we lack the data upon which to form a 
positive opinion as to your financial condition. Mercantile au- 
thorities speak well of you in a general way and we believe you are 
entirely responsible. If it had been your custom to pay your in- 
voices promptly or to discount them, favorable information of 
that character would be a. satisfactory basis for such credit as 
you may require of us; but when you so frequently permit our 
invoices to run beyond their maturity before settlement we feel 
that as a reasonable business proposition we are fairly entitled 
to a closer knowledge of the situation. Any report which you may 
submit to us will, if you so instruct, be held strictly confidential 
and you will find the better acquaintance between us thus brought 
about will be beneficial to yourselves as well as to us. It hardly 
requires argument to support the proposition that when a merchant 
frequently finds it inconvenient to pay at maturity, a frank dis- 
closure of his financial condition, if his affairs are on a substan- 
tial basis, will result to his advantage. 
If your merchandise has not recently been inventoried, your 
conservative estimate of its value will answer. Precise and com- 
plete figures of the indebtedness are desired, but your books will 
enable you very quickly to give the information requested in our 
letters of August to and August 20. We again ask if you will not 
kindly let us have at once the brief report suggested by the 
printed blank enclosed, and assure you your prompt and favor- 
able consideration of this request will be much appreciated. 
Our monthly statement of your valued account showing over- 
due items to the amount of $684 is enclosed. Kindly let us know 
your pleasure concerning them. 
Please accept our best wishes for your continued prosperity.

  404 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
Most of these capacities are measurable either as a 
whole, as in the first four items, or in isolated spe- 
cific aspects of a general capacity as in the last 
group. 
Fig. 27 is a typical musical talent chart. This is the 
case of a highly gifted ten-year-old girl, based on labo- 
ratory measurements. To one who is familiar with the 
significance of the measurements, this picture furnishes 
a graphic profile. It illustrates, is the foundation for, 
and vitalizes the legend which constitutes the report 
of the examination which reads as follows: 
“Theodora has a decidedly musical mind. In the 
three basic capacities for musical hearing — the sense 
of pitch, the sense of intensity, and the sense of time — 
she is superior and well balanced. Her sense of conso- 
nance is of a high order. Her acuity of hearing is only 
average, but this condition is not of the type which will 
affect music seriously in view of her superior sense of 
intensity. Her imagery is all of the moderate type. 
Her auditory imagery can be developed as an excellent 
support to her superior sensory powers and the motor 
and visual imagery are prominent enough for an emo- 
tional background in music. Her lowest record is on 
motility, which is characteristic of the fact that she has 
a deliberate type of mind and is steady in her movements. 
Her physique is average, as indicated by her grip and 
ergogram. Her precision of movement and her simple 
response to a simple signal are slightly above average ; 
while her simple response to a complex signal is decidedly 
better. Her capacity for serial association of sound and 
action is good; whereas her association for visual im- 
pressions and action is barely above average. Her 
timed action and her rhythmic action are both good. 
Her general motor reliability is superior. She sings in

key with remarkable ability and reproduces the interval 
with superior precision, although her voice control is only 
moderately good for nuances of pitch. She has a good 
voice register and an excellent voice quality. Her tonal 
memory is decidedly superior. She gives superior prom- 
ise for speed and reliability in the acquisition of skill 
in music. Her associations are highly versatile and 
remarkably well balanced, but not peculiarly musical. 
Her mental age is fully two years in advance of the 
normal. Emotionally, she’ is cool and undemonstrative, 
but capable of deep feeling for music.” 
Delineations of this type are now made of every pupil 
upon entrance to certain music schools. It serves as an in- 
ventory or a budget of the available talents which makes 
parents and teachers deliberate and plan before deciding 
upon the kind and extent of training to be sought. 
The examination may be made as extensive as facili- 
ties permit and the importance of the case may warrant. 
For those intending to enter upon a professional career 
it may be made very searching. The same principles 
may also be employed in diagnosing the difficulty when 
failure in musical education or career has been encoun- 
tered. In the interest of first search for talent, the 
most fundamental measures are now being made in the 
sixth and eighth grades in the public schools by means of 
the phonograph records.? 
1 When the searchlight of measurement is thrown on the situation, the 
challenge that comes to the music teacher with records of talent raises such 
questions as these: (1) Do I fully realize the magnitude and significance of 
individual differences in my pupils? (2) Do I believe in giving each individual 
pupil in music an opportunity commensurate with his actual capacity and 
aptitude? (3) Do I actually in practice give my pupils an opportunity to grow, 
each according to his talent? (4) Do I keep the pupil always at his natural 
level of achievement? (5) Do I justly praise or blame the pupil? (6) Do I 
rightly identify the retarded child? (The retarded child is the bright child who 
is held in leash to keep.step with the class.) (7) Do I motivate my work for each

406 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
A study of school children by means of these measures 
has revealed countless cases of talent hitherto unrecog- 
nized and undeveloped; has helped in the identification 
of known talent by objective analysis; has furnished 
explanation of the exhibition of unusual talent; has 
certified the absence of talent; has illustrated in a strik- 
ing manner the magnitude of individual differences ; 
has enabled the teacher to verify theories of talent; has 
shown that musical talent is equally distributed among 
high and low; has put the problem of the bright and 
the dull in a new light; has proved that it is possible 
to test the trained and the untrained alike; has shown 
that pupils in singing are not ordinarily grouped on the 
basis of talent for singing; has proved that likes and 
dislikes as stated by children and even by adults are a 
very doubtful indication of talent; has demonstrated 
that musical talent may be measured as early as in the 
fifth grade, or the tenth year; has opened a new ap- 
proach to the study of musical inheritance; and has 
awakened the teacher to an interest in the study of the 
pupil as an individual. It has set an example of a sci- 
entific approach to the problem of the conservation of 
human energies, especially the more precious talents. 
The psychogram. — The talent profile, as in Fig. 27, 
is an example of a psychogram. The data may be ob- 
tained by varied methods and may be of different value. 
The main point in the profile is that it represents rela- 
individual? (8) Do I help my pupil to find himself, or-am I simply satisfied to 
allow him to drop into a class mold? (9) Do I take into account the individual 
as a whole? — his bodily development, his social development, his intellectual 
development, his moral development, his esthetic development, and his religious 
development in music?
-P-A-G-E-425
  INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGY 407 
tively specific factors in quantitative terms on a common 
scale. It has been a dream of enthusiasts to develop 
psychograms which should picture the individual as a 
whole, but we here encounter the principle that with 
increase in extensity we lose in intensity. While the 
general profile is valuable as a preliminary, individual 
psychology demands that it shall be intensive so as to 
show sufficient detail. To the extent that this is done, 
it becomes necessary to select some specific aspect, such 
as a talent. Control of the situation always reveals 
the necessity of analyzing the data into fine detail. 
Psychograms have hitherto dealt mainly with the in- 
tellectual and motor capacities, but the affective phase 
of man is of fully as great significance for the evaluation 
of fitness. However, we still lack satisfactory approach 
to the testing, rating, or measuring of the affective and 
moral traits. ( : 
Individual psychology has often met opposition be- 
cause it “bares the individual.” Some of us do not 
object to having our height and weight known, but many 
draw the line when it comes to any objective rating of 
intelligence or imagination. It is regarded somewhat 
in the same way as testifying against one’s self. This 
will, however, change to a great extent. 
Labor organizations have objected to the application 
of individual psychology on the ground that it would 
discourage uniformity of treatment. But the time has 
passed when one man can be regarded as good as another. 
1 The items in Fig. 27 do not correspond in detail to the items in the analy- 
sis of musical talent above because many types of measurements may be 
made under each item in the analysis and the chart shows what actual meas- 
urements were made,
-P-A-G-E-426
  
408 INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
It has also been, charged that individual psychology 
has as its main goal the principle of efficiency. In its 
inceptive stage that seems to be true because that is 
what people first demand. But individual psychology 
is not so limited, for it reveals the nature, capacity, and 
needs of the individual as a bodily, intellectual, moral, 
social, esthetic, and religious being, and voices the de- 
mands of the individual for self-realization in these 
capacities and rights. The economic principle will 
foster individual psychology just as it has fostered tem- 
perance and peace. But the economic issue is not the 
great issue involved in either temperance or peace, though 
it may be the immediate and efficient pressing issue. 
So the principle of efficiency is, perhaps, most conspic- 
uous in individual psychology, whereas the principle 
of self-realization in the fullest sense is its real objective.

The focusing system 
consists of four refracting 
media: the cornea, the 
aqueous humor of the 
anterior camera, the crys- 
talline lens, and the vit- 
reous humor. The most 
important of these is the 
lens, which is capable of 
focusing for different 
distances through the ac- 
tion of the ciliary muscle 
(ciliary process) upon the 
capsule which holds the 
lens. aioe

(Fig. 29); namely, the four direct muscles — the superior, 
the inferior, the external and the internal rectus, which turn 
the ball up, down, outward, and inward respectively; and 
two oblique muscles, acting at right angles to the direct 
muscles, for the purpose of rotating the ball upon its axis. 
A cross-section of the retina (Fig. 30) may be divided into 
five parts. Counting from the top of the figure, from the 
choroid toward the center of the eyeball, there is, A, a layer 
of pigmented cells, the visual purple; B, a layer of rods and 
cones, the end-organs of vision; C, the bipolar cells, which 
serve to amplify and transmit the impulse from the rods and 
cones to D, the nerve cells from which E, the axons unite to 
form a branch of the optic nerve to the brain. 
The ear. — The ear consists of three parts: the external, 
the middle, and the inner. : 
The external ear (Fig. 31) consists of the auricle and the 
external auditory cavity A, ending in the tympanic membrane B.

of the ear SC, Fig. 32) with the

(S, U) which are the organs of equilibrium; and the cochlea 
(F, Fig. 31; C, Fig. 32), which is the organ of hearing. Each 
of these is supplied with a branch of the auditory nerve G. 
The cochlea is composed of a bony labyrinth with two and 
one-half windings in the snail-shell structure. The canal 
is divided by the bony shelf (2 in Fig. 33, limbus laminae 
spiralis, Fig. 34), which is continued as the basilar membrane 
(Fig. 34) into the tympanic canal (3, Fig. 33) and vestibular 
canal (1, Fig. 33. Cf. 
scala tympani and scala

Both are filled with a 
liquid called perilymph

The end-organs of smell (Fig. 36) lie in the olfactory bulb, 
which is genetically an extension of a lobe from the brain. 
The olfactory cells (at the bottom of the figure) lie in the 
lining of the mucous membrane and send their branches to 
the brain cells which lie in the bulb; the axons from these 
cells form the olfactory tract, which is the nerve of smell.

Fig. 39 is a very crude schematic representation of the 
organization of the neural arc illustrating the course that 
the nerve impulse will take, e.g., when a finger is withdrawn 
from the prick of a pin. A denotes the brain and B the

cell, f a brain cell in one of the basal ganglia, a axon from 
the pyramidal cell in the cortex of the brain, and C a motor 
neurone in the spinal cord with fine branching of its axon 
in muscle fibrils. 
The spinal cord is a grand trunk cable between the brain 
and the sensory and motor end-organs. It is a double organ 
containing the cables running into the brain in each half of 
the back side and the cables running out from the brain 
on each side of the front. The smaller nerve trunks are con- 
nected from the respective levels of the body throughout 
the length of the cord. The sensory and the motor nerves 
join in a single cable from each level.

autonomic nervous system, viewing the cord from the front 
and the brain from the front and below. The spinal nerves 
are named and numbered at the right. The twelve cranial 
nerves, not named, lie above the cervical and are so called 
because their roots lie within the cranium. The names of 
the segments of the sympathetic system (printed in heavy

for codperation. The two halves of the brain are separated 
by the large median fissure shown slightly in Fig. 42, but 
clearly in Fig. 41, where 
it runs down to the cor-

is made up of the com-
